Title: DrupalCon Prague 2013: DRUPAL 8 READY
Publication date: 2013-09-26
Playlist: DrupalCon Prague - September 2013
Description: 
	What are the core skills, tools and practices you will need to be Drupal 8 ready? How do you get them now?

Drupal 8 may be the biggest change in Drupal's history. For the first time, large parts of Drupal's core and API are disappearing, replaced by newer, more powerful systems. Drupal 8 also introduces new developer tools, such as the Plugin system, and radically different front-end changes, such as the introduction of Twig, and changes to the way responsive, accessible and mobile-friendly projects work.

This session will focus on the changes in Drupal 8 mean for developers, project managers, system administrators AND content managers, looking at what skills and knowledge are required, and how to get ready before Drupal 8 lands.

It will not be a technical deep dive, but promises a comprehensive and concise introduction to Drupal 8.

I think we'll probably get started so we

00:00:01,829 --> 00:00:04,410
don't take too long today we've got

00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:11,190
quite a bit to get through in this

00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:13,200
session welcome to Drupal 8 ready my

00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:15,299
name is Christopher skein and my

00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,340
colleague Boris Gordon is sitting over

00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:18,980
there in the comfy chairs which would be

00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:21,420
quite good for him for most of this talk

00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:25,890
today today's sessions about helping you

00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:27,480
prepare for Drupal 8 and what we're

00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:29,429
going to do is reduce Drupal 8 it's

00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:33,210
really long change list down to a number

00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:36,660
of kind of useful actionable things that

00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:38,309
you can do to get you ready for Drupal 8

00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:40,500
when it launches hopefully early next

00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:41,910
year and if you saw the keynote as I'm

00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,530
sure most of you did you've already got

00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:44,370
a bit of prep for this session we're

00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:48,829
going to talk about some of the things

00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:48,829
same things in a bit of a different way

00:00:50,539 --> 00:00:58,559
there are over 500 Drupal 8 change

00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:02,100
records some of these are relatively

00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:03,799
minor they might be a signature change

00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:07,200
for a function or something else that

00:01:03,799 --> 00:01:09,299
can probably pick up later on but others

00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:14,270
are quite significant such as a new API

00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:16,380
or a new way of doing an old thing

00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:18,000
there's a lot of stuff to look through

00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:21,000
here and it's very difficult for the

00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,259
average developer to go through all of

00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,070
these and work out what all the changes

00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:29,759
are depending on how you count them

00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:32,369
there's also 24 odd new AP is or changed

00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:35,040
api's depends what you call an API

00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:38,130
really but there's quite a high number

00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,750
and some of those are quite important

00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:41,670
some of them not so important so we're

00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:43,950
going to filter out some of those today

00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:46,020
as well the subject of this presentation

00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:48,869
is to distill those changes down for you

00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:51,600
so you can prepare for Drupal 8 so what

00:01:48,869 --> 00:01:53,840
are we going to cover we're going to

00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,950
look at changes in additions in Drupal 8

00:01:53,840 --> 00:02:00,930
we're going to break them down by role

00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:02,369
and by technology group then we're going

00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:04,380
to give you some learning resources for

00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:05,850
each thing okay so you need to go away

00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:08,670
and actually find out what it is or how

00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:11,580
it works and finally we're going to give

00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:12,750
you some pointers to relevant Drupal

00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:13,470
concessions that are on for the next

00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:15,430
couple of days

00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:17,260
we can't provide the level of detail

00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:20,500
that's needed to really get into any of

00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:23,590
these but they can it's also worth

00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:26,890
noting that the Drupal 8 API is still in

00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:29,380
flux is still changing not in a major

00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:32,740
way but just in a minor way details are

00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:34,930
changing so what we talked about here

00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:41,520
today you know might shift a little bit

00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:44,350
before it releases that's all right in

00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:45,940
preparing this session we've tried to

00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:49,660
work out what skills are actually

00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:51,850
important what do you need to know what

00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:53,830
do you not need to know we've put

00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:56,800
together the skills matrix which I know

00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:59,290
you can't read we looked at the skills

00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,840
required for three groups site builders

00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:04,540
themes and developers and we looked at

00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,640
how these skills started if you came on

00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:09,160
a triple six what skills you need it

00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,750
there how that might have changed in

00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:13,450
Drupal 7 and what you might have needed

00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:15,400
for Drupal 8 and this diagram is

00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:16,750
available on our website if you want to

00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,850
dig into it it includes some extra stuff

00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:20,400
that we're not going to cover today i'll

00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:23,250
give you a link for that in a second

00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:25,900
mm-hmm it's also slightly out of date

00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:27,100
this was made probably a month ago and I

00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:28,959
reckon there's a few things we'd remove

00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:31,810
and a couple of things we might add now

00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:34,030
but the bigger picture is still correct

00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:35,500
if you started with Drupal 6 you you

00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:37,360
actually had quite a lot to learn this

00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:39,760
is tribal knowledge as Theresa mentioned

00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,290
in the previous presentation when you

00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,549
transition to Drupal 7 you actually

00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:43,900
still had quite a lot to learn again

00:03:42,549 --> 00:03:46,390
drupal 7 had a really steep learning

00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:48,310
curve which is something a lot of us

00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:50,370
forget and if you started with drupal 7

00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:54,489
you wouldn't have even come across that

00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:57,489
and i guess in our opinion despite some

00:03:54,489 --> 00:03:59,380
of the rumors to the contrary Drupal 8

00:03:57,489 --> 00:04:01,989
doesn't introduce a significantly large

00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:03,790
number of Drupal API changes it

00:04:01,989 --> 00:04:07,299
introduces a few big ones but they're

00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:10,299
not it's not an unusual number for a new

00:04:07,299 --> 00:04:11,799
Drupal release um however for the first

00:04:10,299 --> 00:04:13,510
time it does introduce a significant

00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:18,820
number of new programming paradigms for

00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:22,560
developers and that's that's where some

00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:24,580
of the issues are coming in currently

00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,349
for most of the categories that we've

00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:26,800
looked at the relative number of changes

00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:30,909
has

00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:32,860
in fairly small so just roughly if you

00:04:30,909 --> 00:04:34,539
started with with Drupal 6 you had to

00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:37,000
learn maybe seven new skills for a site

00:04:34,539 --> 00:04:41,289
builder Drupal 7 only introduced a few

00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:44,710
Drupal 8 it's got a few more again for

00:04:41,289 --> 00:04:46,449
Themis this one's pretty static the

00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:48,729
major one in Drupal 8 is that twig has

00:04:46,449 --> 00:04:50,199
changed but in Drupal 7 you kinda had to

00:04:48,729 --> 00:04:54,789
learn render arrays and frankly that's

00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:56,259
harder so and when we're talking about

00:04:54,789 --> 00:04:58,150
the Drupal API the number of major

00:04:56,259 --> 00:04:59,680
changes in the Drupal IPO API has been

00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:04,569
fairly stable as well over those three

00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:06,240
versions a Drupal eights introducing

00:05:04,569 --> 00:05:09,460
more but but it's not it's not a lot

00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,690
what is different is perhaps the number

00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:12,490
of other skills that you'll need to

00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:14,199
learn and we're going to focus on some

00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:15,669
of those today so these skills are

00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:18,639
mostly related to object-oriented

00:05:15,669 --> 00:05:21,069
programming and kind of modern PHP

00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:23,069
programming practices as well as some

00:05:21,069 --> 00:05:26,080
expertise in other libraries and tools

00:05:23,069 --> 00:05:28,240
it's this part which which I think

00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:32,440
personally cause some causes some of the

00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:35,770
the fud around drupal and perhaps leads

00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:37,870
to forks potentially and the good news

00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:39,610
is that these are not really Drupal

00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:41,740
skills they're actually really good

00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:43,599
programming skills so if you've got them

00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:45,370
already you'll find it relatively easy

00:05:43,599 --> 00:05:46,930
to move into Drupal 8 and if you don't

00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:48,520
have them then learning them is going to

00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:51,099
make you a better developer a better

00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:56,710
member of your team and probably make

00:05:51,099 --> 00:05:58,930
you happier as well so fundamentally we

00:05:56,710 --> 00:06:00,129
want to help you scale up today from

00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:01,979
today's session if you haven't learned

00:06:00,129 --> 00:06:04,150
something new you know where to find it

00:06:01,979 --> 00:06:06,340
and as you go through if you like you

00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:08,650
you may wish to jot down just keep a

00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:11,080
tally of the skills that we we list see

00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:12,370
how you go one point per slide and then

00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:16,360
at the end you can compare your scores

00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:17,830
and see how you're going we've also got

00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:19,750
an awful lot of resources in this

00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:20,620
presentation so we've made sure they're

00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:23,590
all available on our website

00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:25,090
previousnext comdata you / Drupal 8

00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:27,039
ready that links through or three

00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:28,300
discussions listening all the things

00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:29,289
we're going to talk about so you don't

00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:32,169
feel you need to have to copy down

00:06:29,289 --> 00:06:36,509
everything crazily and you can jump

00:06:32,169 --> 00:06:36,509
through there all right so let's go

00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:49,610
the first of our three sections site

00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:51,200
builders wats new for site builders well

00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:55,100
it's point-and-click but not as we know

00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:57,110
it there are seven significant areas for

00:06:55,100 --> 00:07:00,110
scientist that site builders are going

00:06:57,110 --> 00:07:01,310
to need to learn for Drupal 8 now if

00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:03,140
you're a femur or if you're a developer

00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:05,570
you kind of need to learn these as well

00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:08,120
so these sort of stack up on top of each

00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:09,050
other if you're a site builder and you

00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:12,380
don't want to hang around after this

00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:14,660
section by all means that's fine the

00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:17,350
first one and I think this is really

00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:19,760
significant as the use of schema.org

00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:22,180
instead of using RDF mappings from a

00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:24,140
range of vocabularies dublin core 5

00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:27,680
semantically interconnected online

00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:30,410
communities etc etc Drupal uses content

00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:32,000
mappings purely from schema.org for

00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:33,620
example where we previously had a dublin

00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,550
core title we now just use the schema

00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:39,230
name nobody really understands RDF or

00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:40,340
rdfa all right if I light or any of

00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:42,260
these other technologies we've been

00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:43,820
using previously and despite the fact

00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:45,740
that they're really great they're really

00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:48,440
hard to use and that's kind of how

00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:51,500
schema.org came about so dress has

00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:53,420
already shown you some SEO examples

00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:55,400
which is good that's the benefit that

00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:56,240
you get from it however as a site

00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:58,970
builder you're going to want to

00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,830
understand how schema torgus structures

00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:02,570
content because all your content is

00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:04,940
going to come out with schema.org markup

00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:07,490
pretty much by default you're going to

00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:09,350
want to know when you're adding new

00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:11,630
fields how to relate those to that

00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:15,310
structure how to add properties and how

00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:15,310
to maximize your opportunities there

00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:22,250
there's not a whole lot of resources you

00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:26,480
need for that but it's good just to go

00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:28,910
on schema.org and have a little look the

00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:31,220
second one is restful web services so

00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:34,120
using the new rest and serialization API

00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:38,590
as you can output data as Jason an HTML

00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:40,669
a great deal of what we do online is

00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:42,590
coming through apps and other services

00:08:40,669 --> 00:08:45,320
so this is a great new tool actually for

00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:46,370
site builders as well as developers to

00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,960
think about how they structure their

00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:50,270
content and how it ends up coming out

00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:51,440
the other side as a good if you don't

00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:53,480
know what rest is because it can be

00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,670
confusing if you to it there's a good

00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:56,190
example there what is rest explained

00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:58,760
using

00:08:56,190 --> 00:09:01,020
box which I recommend you check out and

00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:03,450
lynn clark and classy have a session

00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:07,220
wednesday one o'clock rest and

00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:07,220
serialization and drupal which is good

00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:12,750
blocks in drupal 8 finally getting some

00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:15,540
love blocks have been around since

00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:18,150
drupal one pretty much they have hardly

00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:20,400
changed at all they're finally getting

00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:23,550
fields and revisions they're kind of

00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:25,350
their entities effectively so they

00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:27,330
lacked a bit more like nodes and that's

00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:30,390
great really makes it much easier to

00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:32,130
build interesting sites not all of the

00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:35,100
tools that are needed for blocks will

00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:36,990
probably go in i don't think the UI for

00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:39,510
revisions will make it in and it will

00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:42,300
probably end up in contribute it's all

00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:44,660
coming and as a good session blocks from

00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:47,190
drop the dog to drupal 8 and beyond

00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:49,170
wednesday 1045 if you interested in the

00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:50,400
drupal API that's also a really good one

00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:57,810
for you because it kind of talks about

00:09:50,400 --> 00:10:00,410
that it's a bit more developer ii having

00:09:57,810 --> 00:10:02,520
ckeditor in core is just one of the

00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:03,990
several editing improvements and

00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:05,400
addresses cover these are lots i'm not

00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:07,440
going to talk about it too much but a

00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:10,190
good session for this is designing

00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:14,460
Drupal 8 with listen on and Bohen

00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:15,750
wednesday at one o'clock i think most

00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:17,370
people can probably work these out for

00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:19,650
themselves but we do think it's really

00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:20,940
important and significant one that you

00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:23,220
might need a bit of help with however is

00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:28,110
tor api because this is kind of a site

00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:29,840
builder tool if you like this is a pure

00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:32,730
API gives you the ability to add

00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:34,800
contextual tours to individual pages you

00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:37,020
can stick in little pop-ups that open up

00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:41,370
and give information for people when

00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:43,290
they come along to api was added by

00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:44,790
members of our team at previousnext and

00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:47,310
there's a little bit of stuff on our

00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:49,410
website about creating a tour actually

00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:53,820
really easy you can create tours just by

00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:55,110
writing a bit of a yanil file so it's

00:10:53,820 --> 00:11:00,540
not too hard and a skill that most

00:10:55,110 --> 00:11:01,920
people i think can learn only a couple

00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:03,480
more things for site builders really

00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:06,470
that we think are important the first

00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:08,910
one is configuration import and export

00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:10,080
if you've used features before you you

00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:13,800
know what this is

00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:15,960
and you know how it works the way it's

00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:17,460
working in Drupal AIT's a bit simpler

00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:20,970
actually it's kind of your entire site

00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:22,530
gets dunked to config but it's something

00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:24,510
to consider and something to look up on

00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:26,040
and make sure that when you're building

00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:30,900
your site you're aware of how this is

00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:33,030
going to work there's some there's an

00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:36,360
article managing configuration in Drupal

00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:38,880
8 on the website there and configuration

00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:44,520
management features by Andrea pisghetti

00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:45,690
is also a really good resource finally

00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:47,340
the other big change that we think is

00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:49,860
important for site builders is the move

00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:54,270
away from node IDs and other identifiers

00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:56,370
to uuid you you IDs are basically

00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:58,980
universally unique identifiers if you

00:11:56,370 --> 00:12:00,030
haven't come across them before and

00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:02,430
they're going to start tuning up all

00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:04,650
over the place so just knowing what they

00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:10,080
are and how they work is it's quite

00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:12,230
useful there's some other well that's

00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:14,640
the wrong slide that's the theming slide

00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:17,310
let's move on and if you're a site

00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:18,420
builder and you don't want to hang

00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:20,070
around for themas you actually might

00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:22,050
want to run into the panorama Hall right

00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:26,030
now and see Drupal 8 for site builders

00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:29,640
with swim tell the display sweetwater I

00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:32,730
won't be offended if you leave alright

00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:36,240
Klimas what's new for Themis again about

00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:38,520
seven things for Themis one of these is

00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,980
is fairly important and at the top one

00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:42,480
on this list and it's twig it's

00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:46,470
important but I don't believe it's

00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:49,400
particularly difficult Tigers are

00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:52,110
templating language written for PHP

00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:55,620
replaces PHP template for template files

00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:56,940
as stress is already outlined and it has

00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:58,830
a number of improvements it's much

00:12:56,940 --> 00:13:00,510
simpler it doesn't contain that crazy

00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:05,420
render function that appeared in Drupal

00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:08,580
7 and it's generally pretty easy to use

00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:09,840
so that's a big plus that we've got that

00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:12,480
in there now and hopefully that will

00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:16,950
lead to a bit more adoption twig is

00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:18,390
available from senseo labs and this good

00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:19,890
documentation there and the Drupal 8

00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:21,570
theme guides already been updated which

00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:23,050
is awesome if you want to go and see

00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:26,200
more sessions on twig however

00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:30,430
there's loads twig and the new theme

00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:32,140
layer in Drupal 8 5 o'clock today twig a

00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:34,360
templating system for designers tomorrow

00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:37,300
1045 and twig it's ship it which is a

00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:43,660
lab so that's a good two hours of twig

00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:46,810
practice for you tomorrow at one perhaps

00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:49,779
more complex is backbone.js if you're a

00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:51,670
front-end ur designer fema and you're

00:13:49,779 --> 00:13:53,920
looking at creating interesting

00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:56,519
javascript powered web apps then

00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:58,810
backbone j s is your new best friend

00:13:56,519 --> 00:14:03,610
backbone is a javascript library which

00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:07,480
essentially provides Model View design

00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:11,649
paradigm for single page web

00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:13,959
applications and it keeps your Drupal

00:14:11,649 --> 00:14:16,300
data kind of front and center for you so

00:14:13,959 --> 00:14:18,190
that's what it's there for well

00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:20,170
documented on backbone jst org the

00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:22,120
Drupal stuff is not particularly well

00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:23,860
documented but you can check out the

00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:26,350
current implementation of the backbone

00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:28,329
module which has a good good stuff there

00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:36,970
and there's a presentation with deal

00:14:28,329 --> 00:14:40,270
answer today at three forty-five Drupal

00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:42,850
8 has some good deal of responsive

00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:44,079
design in it and we've put this one and

00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:45,820
even though it's not really a Drupal

00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:49,959
thing because we kind of feel it's

00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:52,360
important Drupal 8 is responsive out of

00:14:49,959 --> 00:14:54,700
the box and if you're not able to design

00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:56,740
and build responsive sites then over the

00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:58,180
top of it then you're at a bit of a loss

00:14:56,740 --> 00:15:01,870
Europe and a bit of a competitive

00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:04,060
disadvantage so we think responsive

00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:05,740
designers practices are a really

00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:08,440
important thing that needs to be learned

00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:10,720
for Drupal 8 and also just using some of

00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:13,600
the built-in features like the picture

00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:19,959
element the breakpoints module just to

00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:21,279
produce better quality sites Therese

00:15:19,959 --> 00:15:22,630
also mentioned the JavaScript

00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:26,230
accessibility features which is really

00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:27,730
good one of the things that drupal's

00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:30,360
been working towards for a number of

00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:32,480
years now is kind of back to front

00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:35,060
accessibility

00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:37,370
I don't know what what you call it in

00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:40,610
Europe but in America at section 508 in

00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:44,510
Australia we use WCAG you may use WCAG

00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:45,889
here as well I hope you do there's a

00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:47,810
couple of new JavaScript tools that

00:15:45,889 --> 00:15:50,660
allow you to produce more accessible

00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:53,060
websites previousnext recently did work

00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:54,829
for disability disabilitycare Australia

00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:58,160
which is Australia's national disability

00:15:54,829 --> 00:15:59,959
insurance scheme and weird to make sure

00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:01,610
that was well and truly accessible and

00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:06,560
this kind of tool would have been very

00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:08,600
very useful on that project so the two

00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:10,730
accessibility features are drupal dot

00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:18,800
announced and drupal tapping manager if

00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:23,019
you're looking for them drupal 7 I think

00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:26,959
uses jquery 1.4 does that sound right

00:16:23,019 --> 00:16:29,389
yep someone says yep good so Drupal 8 is

00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:33,380
going to use what is effectively jQuery

00:16:29,389 --> 00:16:37,399
1.9 however without support for IE 6 7 &

00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:38,839
8 that may be significant if you work

00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:39,949
with government or other clients that

00:16:38,839 --> 00:16:41,449
actually have these legacy browsers

00:16:39,949 --> 00:16:45,319
because you'll actually have to find a

00:16:41,449 --> 00:16:49,060
way to get 1.9 back in there the latter

00:16:45,319 --> 00:16:49,060
part is intended to be provided by

00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:59,300
contributor point 0 except that two

00:16:57,529 --> 00:17:04,419
point O just doesn't have that compel it

00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:06,559
compatibility layer two more things that

00:17:04,419 --> 00:17:08,120
theme is are going to watch out for in

00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:11,360
Drupal 8 the first is that there are new

00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:13,160
CSS coding standards now most of the

00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:15,530
time coding standards generally applied

00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:17,780
a core however if you're writing a

00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:19,579
module or you're working on a patch for

00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:24,319
a module coding standards really help

00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:26,049
you to create a solid base for your work

00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:28,179
and make sure that people aren't

00:17:26,049 --> 00:17:32,030
updating your patches purely on

00:17:28,179 --> 00:17:32,960
formatting grounds so the Drupal a CSS

00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:34,910
standards are in there they're really

00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:37,190
useful and they're a good resource and I

00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:39,830
encourage you to use them finally and

00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:41,929
perhaps somewhat controversially we

00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:43,760
believe that FEMA's are going to need to

00:17:41,929 --> 00:17:46,100
learn a little bit about PHP

00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:48,320
namespace usage there's a lot of new

00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:50,090
object oriented code and drupal and you

00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:52,220
don't really need to know how it works

00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:55,100
but you need to know what a namespace is

00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:58,640
you kind of need to know how to call a

00:17:55,100 --> 00:18:00,680
static method on a class because you may

00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:04,370
find yourself doing this while in a

00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:06,320
theme template or theme file or similar

00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:08,000
if you're writing pre-process functions

00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,020
or doing any of that kind of work some

00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,600
of the functions that you've called

00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:15,020
previously just as functions and now

00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:16,490
going to be static methods on objects so

00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:18,320
having a little bit of an understanding

00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:20,120
about how these work is going to help

00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:21,620
you immensely to work your way through

00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:23,690
there you don't need to know how to

00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:25,010
write object-oriented code but you do

00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:29,990
need to know a little bit about how to

00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:31,310
read it it's another mind changes as

00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:35,380
well some of the functions that you've

00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:35,380
used previously as a themer have gone

00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:39,910
CSS and J's are now added using an

00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:42,710
attached property on the render array

00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:44,600
Drupal set title is gone and there's a

00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:48,050
new breadcrumb apoi in there as well if

00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:49,220
you need to do breadcrumbs most theme is

00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:52,910
however I suspect we'll probably just

00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:55,520
use a module for that so I'm going to

00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:58,370
pass over now to Boris he's going to do

00:18:55,520 --> 00:19:10,630
the bulk of this talk for developers

00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:16,280
Boris hello so how many developers here

00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:18,650
everyone okay and how many have left

00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:20,450
loading Drupal 8 up until this week and

00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:22,850
they're kind of hoping to really get a

00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:30,410
grip on it and the rest of you know drip

00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:33,890
late already okay good so there's quite

00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:36,740
a quite a few changes and we just tried

00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:40,130
to compile sort of that the the must

00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:44,360
nodes and some some of them quite big

00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:46,040
but they're really not that hard and the

00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:48,110
main one is really this object oriented

00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:52,430
in general so I've actually quite

00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:55,430
curious who he is a primarily a Drupal

00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:57,110
programmer and only does oo in like

00:19:55,430 --> 00:20:01,820
drupal 7 doesn't have

00:19:57,110 --> 00:20:12,500
mutsu the background nobody 12 there

00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:16,460
must be more come on well it's a lot of

00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:20,140
drupal 8 is going to be really getting

00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:24,380
everyone up to speed with web PHP is

00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:27,440
today so that basically means 5.3 and

00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:31,100
above and more than that best practices

00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:34,070
and patterns that that that that makes

00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:36,700
easier and as Chris said that the beauty

00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:42,230
of learning this stuff is it's not hard

00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:43,580
and if you have hiring problems for

00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:46,190
instance I think you might find that

00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:49,160
you'll find I know that when I get when

00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:51,110
I engage with the PHP community we're

00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:53,090
more likely to have discussions that

00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:56,090
involve things like factory methods and

00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:58,790
dependency injection then it in when we

00:20:56,090 --> 00:21:00,380
engage in the Drupal community so you

00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:05,600
know the beauty of this is that we're

00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:08,330
really opening up and finding joining

00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:10,700
the rest of the PHP world so that's

00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:11,870
really the big takeaway and this is a

00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:14,600
great if you haven't learnt the stuff

00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:17,210
this is the perfect week to really dive

00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:20,059
in I'm going to recommend a bunch of

00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:22,610
sessions to go to sort of some of the

00:21:20,059 --> 00:21:26,270
some of the top things and and then of

00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:32,840
course the code sprint which is the best

00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:35,179
way to learn so if your sounds like most

00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:38,720
people think they're pretty comfortable

00:21:35,179 --> 00:21:42,650
with object I would appear to be but if

00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:45,830
you have only done over in PHP sort of

00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:47,540
in the old days and aren't used to some

00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:49,640
of these patterns it's more than just

00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:51,650
the syntax so sure everyone's

00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:53,950
comfortable with the syntax but it's

00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:56,270
more important to kind of understand

00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:58,010
some of these some of these patterns and

00:21:56,270 --> 00:22:01,190
paradigms and so here's some here's some

00:21:58,010 --> 00:22:04,010
good resources arm there's a great book

00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:05,720
there at the bottom which really covers

00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:07,550
all of this stuff and and this website

00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:09,440
page speed the right ways but probably

00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:11,830
the first place to go

00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:14,269
it'll take you through everything

00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:16,070
everything that that's best practice in

00:22:14,269 --> 00:22:18,440
PHP world and that's that's an updated

00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:21,049
resource as well and it's very much in

00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:25,970
line with where drupal 8 development is

00:22:21,049 --> 00:22:30,590
heading so as for sessions on this topic

00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:33,620
there's a great general object-oriented

00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:39,379
session which I heard went over quite

00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:42,230
well in triple cotton Portland and and

00:22:39,379 --> 00:22:43,429
probably the the one that the one that

00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:45,110
might seem a little bit strange there is

00:22:43,429 --> 00:22:48,169
I've recommended a Drupal development

00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:51,740
using PHP storm because again if you're

00:22:48,169 --> 00:22:52,909
coming into this new you may have um I'm

00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:55,240
assuming that people haven't really

00:22:52,909 --> 00:22:57,919
played with core here because I'm a

00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:59,629
beginner session but one thing that

00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:02,570
might throw you off is if you're used to

00:22:59,629 --> 00:23:04,490
using a text editor in this case tooling

00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:07,009
mallets if you using a text editor that

00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:09,940
are doesn't help you out um we've got

00:23:07,009 --> 00:23:12,289
lots of files lots of directories and

00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:14,600
having having some interesting tooling

00:23:12,289 --> 00:23:16,490
that can help you navigate that really

00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:19,340
take some of the friction out so I

00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:21,799
recommend going to that into seeing if

00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:23,870
you haven't really seen an ID like that

00:23:21,799 --> 00:23:26,379
is to using using something a bit

00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:30,669
simpler and then and then going away and

00:23:26,379 --> 00:23:34,879
getting your tools a bit sharper may be

00:23:30,669 --> 00:23:37,250
upgrading your text editor etc so the

00:23:34,879 --> 00:23:47,120
big one that everyone's aware of is our

00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:50,120
symfony2 so the the beauty of having

00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:55,789
symfony2 components really at the core

00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:57,590
of drip light is actually documentation

00:23:55,789 --> 00:24:01,820
so there's been a bit of bit of fud

00:23:57,590 --> 00:24:03,679
around around sort of you know how

00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:06,470
complexity and how they figured it is to

00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:08,330
learn but actually i think that these

00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:12,169
bits of Drupal core have never been

00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:14,509
better documented and easier to learn so

00:24:12,169 --> 00:24:16,960
they're just in different places so I

00:24:14,509 --> 00:24:19,250
think it's you know important just to

00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:20,990
make sure we all understand that we're

00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:22,100
not we're not talking about the full

00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:24,799
stack framework so

00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:26,059
so apart from the learning exercise you

00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:28,880
don't really want to go to the symphony

00:24:26,059 --> 00:24:31,340
to site and and download the full stack

00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:33,770
documentation and go through it there's

00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:36,260
useful stuff in there but even better is

00:24:33,770 --> 00:24:38,419
the component documentation and it's

00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:40,669
every bit you could literally take a

00:24:38,419 --> 00:24:43,520
class from the we're pulling in from

00:24:40,669 --> 00:24:46,429
symphony and go to the symphony site and

00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:49,150
get a really really detailed explanation

00:24:46,429 --> 00:24:54,169
of how to use it and it's all applicable

00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:59,390
so it's a big step up in in

00:24:54,169 --> 00:25:07,700
understanding some of this core stuff so

00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:13,159
there's some resources and some great

00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:15,400
sessions of course Alex part about this

00:25:13,159 --> 00:25:17,510
approach of pulling in these external

00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:20,570
libraries so who have more to say about

00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:22,659
that and and if you're interested in in

00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:27,380
the symphony project and sort of um

00:25:22,659 --> 00:25:30,409
their approach to two component izing

00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:32,360
and and standardizing and and all those

00:25:30,409 --> 00:25:34,549
sorts of these I've saw psi 0 and and

00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:35,840
the IP the real reasons why we're doing

00:25:34,549 --> 00:25:42,470
this if you want to understand that

00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:49,520
because the Fabian potencia took right

00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:51,140
so this is um not an API per se or any

00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:53,240
any kind of change at that level but

00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:56,780
this is a tool that you really need to

00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:59,570
start to get familiar with this is the

00:25:56,780 --> 00:26:01,700
composer so who if you don't know

00:25:59,570 --> 00:26:04,280
composer you may know something like

00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:08,059
drush make for instance so this is a

00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:10,240
tool that will pull in external

00:26:08,059 --> 00:26:13,850
dependencies or any dependencies really

00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:16,010
and many's versions and do all sorts of

00:26:13,850 --> 00:26:21,409
wonderful things and we're using that to

00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:23,480
pull in the bevy of external code not

00:26:21,409 --> 00:26:28,880
just the symphony components but things

00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:34,130
like guzzle was mentioned before and and

00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:35,420
Zen feeds and some other things now this

00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:37,810
is our it's actually

00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:41,570
it's quite a fun tool to use so i

00:26:37,810 --> 00:26:43,730
recommend having a look and we started

00:26:41,570 --> 00:26:45,890
to use it on our projects in general so

00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:47,780
we use it to manage even drupal 7

00:26:45,890 --> 00:26:50,870
projects so you can you can use it today

00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:54,970
and it really makes makes managing

00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:57,350
external dependencies a lot easier and

00:26:54,970 --> 00:27:03,170
there's a cool conversation from eclipse

00:26:57,350 --> 00:27:04,760
ec so you're covered there ok so this is

00:27:03,170 --> 00:27:06,380
a bit of a simple one but I'm it's

00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:08,480
another external dependency it's another

00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:12,590
chunk of code that we've we pushed out

00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:15,890
and I'm not sure you need to really

00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:17,810
understand the component but you just

00:27:15,890 --> 00:27:20,360
need to know how to read yeah more and I

00:27:17,810 --> 00:27:23,540
think that's you know the sort the short

00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:26,780
of it is that we now have effectively

00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:28,910
are moving from an info file world I

00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:31,400
think you know that may end up

00:27:28,910 --> 00:27:33,650
disappearing altogether and not having

00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:35,510
too many as our own our and metadata and

00:27:33,650 --> 00:27:38,530
configuration things we now can use

00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:42,290
things like yeah Mel and Jason and and

00:27:38,530 --> 00:27:44,090
get all the the security attention and

00:27:42,290 --> 00:27:47,750
not have to maintain it ourselves so

00:27:44,090 --> 00:27:50,390
that's focus focus on Drupal so have a

00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:52,700
few totally new DM or probably quick

00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:54,350
quicker just to open up open up the ML

00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:59,210
file in the Drupal core code and have a

00:27:54,350 --> 00:28:02,180
look alright so this is that this is a

00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:07,760
big one and this is really the reason

00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:09,140
why looking forward why would you well

00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:14,390
why we're going to a lot of this effort

00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:16,700
with the reactor technique so simple

00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:19,370
test as it stands in Drupal 8 simple

00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:22,820
test is still there and it's recommended

00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:25,040
for the web tests as far as i know but

00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:28,130
unit unit tests and now recommended we

00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:30,920
slowly start implementing them in a new

00:28:28,130 --> 00:28:33,800
and new testing framework and the goal

00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:37,190
is was a couple of things once one is

00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:39,830
phpunit is better supported project so

00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:42,770
that's again along this longest track of

00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:45,530
kind of reusing a lot of the PHP world's

00:28:42,770 --> 00:28:47,080
tools but more important than that it's

00:28:45,530 --> 00:28:52,929
going to encourage us to actually

00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:54,730
of unit testable code so in in Drupal 8

00:28:52,929 --> 00:28:58,269
you'll notice when you go through the

00:28:54,730 --> 00:28:59,890
files everything split up so instead of

00:28:58,269 --> 00:29:02,260
instead of functions we have things in

00:28:59,890 --> 00:29:03,940
classes the classes are much smaller and

00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:07,299
there's many files all the way through

00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:10,450
but each of those the goal is to test

00:29:07,299 --> 00:29:14,590
them independent of the other pieces and

00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:15,909
that's why we're why we're pushing for

00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:18,399
dependency injection if you've heard

00:29:15,909 --> 00:29:19,840
this word you're not quite sure kind of

00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:22,240
know it is but you don't don't know why

00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:24,669
we're really pushing for it it's so that

00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:28,929
moving forward we can build this more

00:29:24,669 --> 00:29:31,720
robust unit tested and isolated code and

00:29:28,929 --> 00:29:34,029
so it's good to see that we the ball is

00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:36,730
rolling we'll have a mixed mixed

00:29:34,029 --> 00:29:40,659
approach for for Drupal 8 it's looking

00:29:36,730 --> 00:29:43,419
like a lot of core core components are

00:29:40,659 --> 00:29:47,200
already already have converted the unit

00:29:43,419 --> 00:29:55,080
tests to phpunit and you can you can use

00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:58,929
that today in your in your modules and

00:29:55,080 --> 00:30:03,130
there's two wonderful sessions so highly

00:29:58,929 --> 00:30:07,809
recommended one from the author of

00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:09,460
phpunit and one from M solemn bomb about

00:30:07,809 --> 00:30:11,799
writing how to actually write unit tests

00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:15,700
for code in Drupal 8 so once you see it

00:30:11,799 --> 00:30:18,250
in action that it makes more sense it's

00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:20,260
pretty amazing to be able to run a test

00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:22,120
that takes a fraction of a second rather

00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:25,809
than simple tests that we're all used to

00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:30,519
where we do a full install every time we

00:30:25,809 --> 00:30:32,529
want to run the chest I'm hoping that

00:30:30,519 --> 00:30:36,970
the fan on my laptop will stop blowing

00:30:32,529 --> 00:30:42,539
up every time I want to run tests all

00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:45,370
right so we have a few few extra

00:30:42,539 --> 00:30:47,380
libraries that are probably probably

00:30:45,370 --> 00:30:50,820
good to look into the main one is guzzle

00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:55,960
really what you know it's very common to

00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:58,809
to UM have to have to fit out and we've

00:30:55,960 --> 00:31:00,120
used Drupal HTTP requests that's totally

00:30:58,809 --> 00:31:02,910
gone now so

00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:06,600
we've put in an external external

00:31:02,910 --> 00:31:08,730
library to do this it's more robust it's

00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:10,230
well supported as well tested we've

00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:14,610
already started using it on triple seven

00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:16,740
projects it's really really a good step

00:31:14,610 --> 00:31:19,260
forward the API is very very easy so you

00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:22,890
can just look that up yourself not much

00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:26,130
else needs to be said easy RDF is along

00:31:22,890 --> 00:31:28,890
with similar lines these are these other

00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:30,600
ones are mainly used in core but there

00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:33,560
there there there for you to use but

00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:36,660
ghazal you will most likely use so i

00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:42,030
recommend adding that to your your

00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:44,130
Drupal 8 packing list okay so now we're

00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:49,190
kind of into a quick overview of some of

00:31:44,130 --> 00:31:52,280
the some of the architectural changes

00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:54,410
that you'll want to look too that's

00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:57,450
small background once you've got your

00:31:54,410 --> 00:32:00,930
sort of basic oh I have a quick look at

00:31:57,450 --> 00:32:03,300
dependency injection in some of the

00:32:00,930 --> 00:32:05,130
resources listed before then you can

00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:08,070
look at some of the dribble specifics so

00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:10,950
so these are these are these build on

00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:16,500
top of the the object-oriented best

00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:18,990
practices and we can start with plugins

00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:22,920
now this is a this is a great one so

00:32:18,990 --> 00:32:27,930
this some this effectively replaces info

00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:33,660
hooks so hook block info etc is a good

00:32:27,930 --> 00:32:36,990
example and it lets us some have have

00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:40,500
this kind of one module extend another

00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:43,020
module and override and and do it all in

00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:45,720
a nice clean way and this is a this is

00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:48,120
actually a bit of a bit of an innovation

00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:52,110
in injury blade it's very much inspired

00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:55,650
by sea tools plugins in its purpose but

00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:58,680
it's a totally modern implementation

00:32:55,650 --> 00:33:02,640
using some some ideas from Symphony and

00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:06,090
and and probably the only controversial

00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:09,030
part about that is the use of

00:33:06,090 --> 00:33:11,580
annotations so the metadata is is added

00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:14,550
in comments

00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:17,130
and but this is actually very nice it's

00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:21,720
very cool and it keeps keeps the plug-in

00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:23,700
totally modular and if you come to code

00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:32,640
sprint sure you'll see see some of the

00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:37,260
stuff in action enter tapi so this is

00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:40,020
basically entity entity module in core

00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:42,960
with a lot of cleanup and there's a lot

00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:47,250
of lot of action around this in in the

00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:49,440
translation space I know of but the sort

00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:52,500
of the big pieces are we have sort of

00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:54,450
this are some simpler some simpler

00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:59,970
access is what we're getting now this

00:33:54,450 --> 00:34:01,680
stuff is definitely in flux but but you

00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:04,710
can read through the way through the

00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:06,480
documentation or cut actually the best

00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:07,980
way to learn this would again come to

00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:09,750
the code sprint there's there's a lot of

00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:14,000
a lot of action in this area and you'll

00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:14,000
really get to see it hands-on

00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:31,010
okay so Chris already mentioned the

00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:34,380
configuration management system so

00:34:31,010 --> 00:34:39,270
probably the the thing to realize is

00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:40,650
that it's it's it's very basic it's it's

00:34:39,270 --> 00:34:42,480
going to be very straightforward for you

00:34:40,650 --> 00:34:44,910
to take what you're doing on the

00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:48,090
variable table submitting forms saving

00:34:44,910 --> 00:34:49,590
them in the database and now have that

00:34:48,090 --> 00:34:53,370
not mixed in with your content so

00:34:49,590 --> 00:34:56,910
obviously a big win for managing sites

00:34:53,370 --> 00:35:00,840
and deployments and actually pretty

00:34:56,910 --> 00:35:07,280
pretty easy to use so there's some some

00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:12,900
resources there a great article from

00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:14,700
from Lee Rowland's and great article

00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:17,630
from actually on Christmas light i

00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:19,950
recommend the article from New voll

00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:21,270
about sort of looking at it from a

00:35:19,950 --> 00:35:24,900
features mindset if you've been working

00:35:21,270 --> 00:35:29,580
with features a long time this can be a

00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:32,760
slight paradigm shift but it's simpler

00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:39,720
in some ways so and still get getting

00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:43,440
set type API very straightforward okay

00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:47,760
now for your module developers this is a

00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:51,240
huge win I'm probably more happy about

00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:53,430
this than even even see em I the menu

00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:58,620
system and the railing system and now

00:35:53,430 --> 00:36:00,810
split up and the railing system has been

00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:04,620
kind of really brought up to date so

00:36:00,810 --> 00:36:06,540
it's a lot more sophisticated but we

00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:09,150
still have actually access control and

00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:12,540
and we still have hook menu for for

00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:15,810
adding things to the menu system but by

00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:19,880
replacing the the routing system with

00:36:15,810 --> 00:36:22,410
the Drupal symphony to routing component

00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:24,450
again we get this great documentation

00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:29,070
you can go go and read all about

00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:32,970
symphony routes are today it's all

00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:35,760
applicable and it really gives us all

00:36:32,970 --> 00:36:38,950
sorts of advantages in terms of

00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:42,700
not you know having a route that can can

00:36:38,950 --> 00:36:46,720
respond to two different different types

00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:49,930
etc so and and this is really enabled a

00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:52,810
whole bunch of other other modules in

00:36:49,930 --> 00:36:55,090
the system the rest rest system and it

00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:57,460
kind of touches everything but at its

00:36:55,090 --> 00:36:59,200
core it's actually very very very simple

00:36:57,460 --> 00:37:01,720
there's some great I've noticed some

00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:06,700
great hello world blog posts have been

00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:08,710
popping up lately I can recommend if you

00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:09,970
want to really nail down you're coming

00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:12,550
out of this really fresh and you just

00:37:09,970 --> 00:37:14,560
want to see a practical example see

00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:16,420
dependency injection new routing system

00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:19,869
kind of all thrown together there's a

00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:22,270
blog post they're using Drupal 8 sneer

00:37:19,869 --> 00:37:24,700
at controller and the the second one so

00:37:22,270 --> 00:37:28,030
that's like two pages and you can get a

00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:32,020
great introduction or you can go really

00:37:28,030 --> 00:37:35,770
deep and go see Tim's session on

00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:40,420
Thursday okay I think this is probably

00:37:35,770 --> 00:37:45,010
the last big one related to related to

00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:47,200
the dependency injection we've moved a

00:37:45,010 --> 00:37:51,369
lot of these global global drupal

00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:52,390
functions into a service container not

00:37:51,369 --> 00:37:54,339
two months of so you don't really need

00:37:52,390 --> 00:37:56,410
to understand it except how did how to

00:37:54,339 --> 00:37:59,470
use them and there's lots of examples

00:37:56,410 --> 00:38:01,660
around and again the symphony Symphony

00:37:59,470 --> 00:38:04,570
documentation is is good but if you want

00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:06,400
to really get into some nitty gritty um

00:38:04,570 --> 00:38:13,720
this is uh this is some pretty cool

00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:16,119
stuff in our Drupal core okay and then

00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:17,230
probably a brief mention forms we've got

00:38:16,119 --> 00:38:22,630
a little bit of an object oriented

00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:24,970
wrapper around these things but its

00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:28,750
basic says there's if you know form API

00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:30,640
and you know you can extend it interface

00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:34,510
and you've got a few methods to override

00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:36,010
or implement including a builder form a

00:38:34,510 --> 00:38:37,119
validator and similar sort of like how

00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:39,099
we've done before but instead of

00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:41,800
magically named functions we now have

00:38:39,099 --> 00:38:44,920
them in one object but it's actually

00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:45,970
quite this is quite intuitive are the

00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:53,550
guts of it

00:38:45,970 --> 00:38:56,830
make sense not as radical a change and

00:38:53,550 --> 00:39:02,680
obviously there's a lot more that

00:38:56,830 --> 00:39:04,930
there's a plenty of api's and some of

00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:07,990
these are some of these are likely to to

00:39:04,930 --> 00:39:11,200
be changing I think entity translations

00:39:07,990 --> 00:39:15,270
in influx settings and storages is

00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:17,890
interesting thats related to cmi around

00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:20,710
overriding sort of things you might do

00:39:17,890 --> 00:39:22,330
in settings like PHP up to an hour to

00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:23,650
override variables in different

00:39:22,330 --> 00:39:26,920
environments so we have a new API to

00:39:23,650 --> 00:39:31,810
that this is wonderful and and lots more

00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:34,780
so click plenty to dig into our to wrap

00:39:31,810 --> 00:39:38,590
it all up put it all together there's

00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:40,990
some great great sessions hands on the

00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:43,930
upgrading your module to Drupal 8 one is

00:39:40,990 --> 00:39:49,750
is very cool that was given in some form

00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:51,820
in in Sydney and then another one there

00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:53,980
a lab lab session both obsessions so

00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:56,349
lots of time to sit down with a sit down

00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:57,640
with a laptop and and and actually see

00:39:56,349 --> 00:40:00,430
at work which is of course the best way

00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:03,460
to learn these things so hopefully

00:40:00,430 --> 00:40:07,540
that's enough enough of a grab bag I

00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:11,740
think that's plenty plenty to plenty to

00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:13,869

00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:16,030

00:40:19,330 --> 00:40:24,490
place and all week as well but

00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:33,820
to really dig into this stuff ask stupid

00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:35,680

site builder and you've got over 5

00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:14,579
you'll probably do an okay pretty well

00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:16,420
if you're a themer and you've got 10

00:41:14,579 --> 00:41:18,160
fantastic work and if you're a developer

00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:20,589
and if you know kind of 20 of those

00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:23,470
items that we covered then you're well

00:41:20,589 --> 00:41:25,599
on your way it doesn't matter though if

00:41:23,470 --> 00:41:28,770

because they are I have discovered the

00:42:08,650 --> 00:42:13,720
best way of working out often how

00:42:11,559 --> 00:42:15,490
something works they are currently the

00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:17,559
best documentation we have for some
