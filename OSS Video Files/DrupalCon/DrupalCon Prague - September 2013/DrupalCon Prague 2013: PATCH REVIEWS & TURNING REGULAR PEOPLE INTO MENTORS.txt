Title: DrupalCon Prague 2013: PATCH REVIEWS & TURNING REGULAR PEOPLE INTO MENTORS
Publication date: 2013-09-26
Playlist: DrupalCon Prague - September 2013
Description: 
	PATCH REVIEWS: GET GOOD REVIEWS, GIVE GOOD REVIEWS. FASTER.

There are over 2000 core issues waiting for reviews. We need more reviews faster. A shortage of timely reviews frustrates patch authors, leads to draining rerolls, and causes some would-be contributors to give up on core. Some reviews, like: "looks good", lack specific useful information. When core committers review issues, they sometimes point out missing core gates requirements that could have been addressed before RTBC. This drags out the time to commit.

STORIES & STRATEGIES: TURNING REGULAR PEOPLE INTO MENTORS OF MENTORS

One of the more daunting things we encounter in core development is getting enough people to regularly contribute. To be sustainable, we need to encourage new contributors to participate in core development. To that end, the Drupal Core Mentoring program seeks to engage new contributors and experienced developers alike to participate in the program. Mentoring provides participants with direction and encouragement to help them find their way in the maze of the Drupal issue queues.
