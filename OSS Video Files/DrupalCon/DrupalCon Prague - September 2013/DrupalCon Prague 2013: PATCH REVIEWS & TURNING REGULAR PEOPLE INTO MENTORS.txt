Title: DrupalCon Prague 2013: PATCH REVIEWS & TURNING REGULAR PEOPLE INTO MENTORS
Publication date: 2013-09-26
Playlist: DrupalCon Prague - September 2013
Description: 
	PATCH REVIEWS: GET GOOD REVIEWS, GIVE GOOD REVIEWS. FASTER.

There are over 2000 core issues waiting for reviews. We need more reviews faster. A shortage of timely reviews frustrates patch authors, leads to draining rerolls, and causes some would-be contributors to give up on core. Some reviews, like: "looks good", lack specific useful information. When core committers review issues, they sometimes point out missing core gates requirements that could have been addressed before RTBC. This drags out the time to commit.

STORIES & STRATEGIES: TURNING REGULAR PEOPLE INTO MENTORS OF MENTORS

One of the more daunting things we encounter in core development is getting enough people to regularly contribute. To be sustainable, we need to encourage new contributors to participate in core development. To that end, the Drupal Core Mentoring program seeks to engage new contributors and experienced developers alike to participate in the program. Mentoring provides participants with direction and encouragement to help them find their way in the maze of the Drupal issue queues.

hi I'm Kathy and this is a core

00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:16,260
conversation and the it has two topics

00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:20,430
in this time slot one of them is patch

00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:24,330
reviews how to get people to review your

00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:27,029
patch and also how to do a patch review

00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:29,340
some of the tools that we use to do that

00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:32,669
some improvements that we need to make

00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:34,649
to the tools and the second topic that

00:00:32,669 --> 00:00:38,280
we will talk about after a break in the

00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:42,120
middle is mentoring mentors how to turn

00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:45,410
regular people into mentors of mentors

00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:49,760
and because this is a core conversation

00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:54,149
the format is a short presentation and

00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:58,050
then a long time for discussion and

00:00:54,149 --> 00:01:00,680
questions so my goal is to do 15 minutes

00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:03,629
presentation 15 minute questions

00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:05,729
15-minute presentation 15-minute

00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:08,369
questions I won't make my goal so you

00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:11,850
guys should like beat me when I get to

00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:16,049
like close to 15 minutes so my name is

00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:18,210
Cathy uh oh and so if if you want to

00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:20,220
stay for only one of those topics that's

00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:24,509
fine and if you want to switch rooms

00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:26,640
that's also totally okay really is um so

00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:30,570
my name is Kathy I'm the SCT on

00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:35,820
drupal.org I'm also yes CT on Twitter so

00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:39,720
you can tweet at me at during the talk

00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:43,860
or after the talk I review patches quite

00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:48,200
often and mostly in core but the topics

00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:54,030
also are going to apply in part to

00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:59,040
contribute outside of the drupal program

00:01:54,030 --> 00:02:01,409
itself I do some other stuff like plan

00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,899
sprints I really like to plan sprints

00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:08,520
and I love going to them so for example

00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:10,500
Friday I and spend a lot of time asking

00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:13,140
other people to do things so that Friday

00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:14,520
happens and I do some things to make

00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:21,660
fry to happen also you should all come

00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:24,000
on Friday Friday sprint day i also have

00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:26,490
a part-time job I work for calm press

00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,270
which is a company in Hamburg Germany

00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:33,840
they're a small Drupal shop of about 20

00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:36,420
people and my job for them is to work on

00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:39,120
core so they pay me 15 hours a week

00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:41,100
which I split between actually working

00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:45,120
on core and blogging about working on

00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:47,280
core and and then usually I also can't

00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:55,980
stop working on core so then I keep

00:02:47,280 --> 00:03:01,590
going even if they don't pay me so a

00:02:55,980 --> 00:03:04,230
little bit about the process and why

00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:08,010
reviews are so important web chick has

00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:09,750
this awesome a talk that she gives and

00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:13,230
there's a video recording of it a

00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:16,800
youtube video and there's a tiny URL a

00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:20,610
web chick dash how and this is one of

00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:23,519
the slides in her talk and it shows that

00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:26,970
we can't solve any problem that we have

00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:29,430
by ourselves we need somebody to report

00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:31,350
the bug in a way that makes sense and we

00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:34,980
can understand it we need somebody to

00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:38,280
produce a patch to fix the bug we need

00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:40,290
more people to try and document more

00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,730
things about how to reproduce the bug we

00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:44,100
also need somebody to review the

00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:45,720
proposed solution which they'll find

00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:48,060
problems with which we get a new

00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:50,070
solution then we need another review and

00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:51,900
another new solution and another review

00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:55,170
and it goes on like that and if we don't

00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:57,480
have reviews we don't get anywhere in

00:03:55,170 --> 00:04:00,000
the process that's important both for

00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:03,180
the people who make the patch they want

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,829
their work not to go to waste shouldn't

00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:06,989
sit there in the issue queue forever and

00:04:04,829 --> 00:04:09,870
not do anything and it's also important

00:04:06,989 --> 00:04:11,310
for the people who are doing the reviews

00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:13,440
to know that they are really important

00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:15,329
in the process after it goes through a

00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:17,130
period of community review when the

00:04:15,329 --> 00:04:18,750
community thinks it's good somebody will

00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:20,850
be bold enough to market reviewed and

00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:24,479
tested by the community that's when a

00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:26,430
core committer sees it they will review

00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,670
it if they have a problem with it

00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:29,220
they'll

00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:31,740
set it back to needs work so there's no

00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:33,120
danger in reviewing something because

00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:35,010
there's always somebody else that's

00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:38,850
going to check it after you too you just

00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:42,050
do the best you can it's a big problem

00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:48,720
space we have a thousand five hundred

00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:52,290
open issues that need review not all our

00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:55,560
issues we have like fifteen like 10,000

00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:59,960
or a lot of issues 1500 of them that's

00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:02,640
twenty percent a need review so first

00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:03,690
it's an interesting order but first

00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:13,590
we're going to talk about how to get

00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:16,500
patch reviews if you make a patch when

00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:18,450
you post the patch it's very helpful to

00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:20,220
be specific about the kind of review

00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:22,950
that you need usually you set the status

00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:25,980
to needs review and what kind of review

00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:29,730
so you might add a comment when you post

00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:31,650
your patch like I'm just putting up this

00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:34,140
half done thing because i want to get

00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:36,240
initial feedback on the approach that's

00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:37,950
really helpful for somebody who finds

00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,720
the issue needs review they know what

00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:41,610
kind of review to give or you think

00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,870
you're totally done you're like I really

00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:45,420
think this is great but I need a

00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:46,800
JavaScript person to look at it so now

00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:49,610
you know what kind of review so when you

00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,930
post your review tell people what kind

00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:54,630
you can do that in words in a comment

00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:56,700
and you can also use tags there's some

00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:59,190
really common tags that we use in our

00:05:56,700 --> 00:06:02,700
issue queues and these are some examples

00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:04,770
of them they usually start with needs so

00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:09,200
needs JavaScript review needs a

00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:09,200
usability review needs manual testing

00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:14,340
when you produce a patch you worked

00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:15,780
really hard on you invested time in it

00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:17,400
and you don't want to go it you don't

00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:19,830
want it to go to waste if somebody finds

00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:22,770
your issue because they saw its needs

00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:24,930
review status and then saw that it needs

00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:26,760
a JavaScript review and they can do

00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:28,710
javascript reviews you've got a

00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:30,960
potential reviewer looking at your issue

00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:32,550
you don't want them to leave because

00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,980
they can't understand what the problem

00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:37,170
is or why your approach is a good

00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:39,420
approach in order to keep a reviewer

00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:40,830
looking at your issue it's very helpful

00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:43,860
to update the issues

00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:47,130
summary make sure that there are a clear

00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:49,350
description of the problem steps to be

00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:51,960
able to reproduce the problem and a

00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:54,720
description of your approach maybe if

00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:58,050
other approaches were discussed why they

00:06:54,720 --> 00:07:01,080
were not the one that was chosen and

00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:04,920
there should be a summary so we're easy

00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:06,840
to read five minutes to the point steps

00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:09,210
to reproduce for people who are going to

00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:13,230
test or review your patch should start

00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:15,330
with install Drupal 7 or install Drupal

00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:17,460
8 number one step you have to be really

00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:28,730
clear step-by-step and they should be

00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:33,510
numbered if you add uh needs tags like

00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:36,060
needs screenshot it turns out for almost

00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:39,960
four a bunch of the needs tags the

00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:43,680
community has instructions written down

00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:44,970
that tell people how to do that so we

00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,680
have instructions written down for how

00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:48,480
to manually test something we have

00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:51,980
instructions written down for how to

00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:54,690
review an issue technically but those

00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:56,640
instructions are hidden in a docs page

00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:59,370
tucked in a corner somewhere on

00:07:56,640 --> 00:08:02,430
drupal.org so I think it would be really

00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:06,000
great if when we added needs tags to

00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:08,160
things automatically drupal.org added

00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:13,170
the link to the instructions to the

00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:15,900
issue so this is a mock-up of how that

00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:18,480
might look if you know anything about

00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:21,830
usability and you can tell me if this is

00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:27,570
usable or not that would be great so

00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:30,420
there's both an issue in the drupal org

00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:32,460
kind of infrastructure customizations

00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:35,010
issue queue and there's also one in

00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:37,530
dreaded ER and we can make this happen

00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:40,979
either of those ways and there's pluses

00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:44,640
and minuses to doing that but the idea

00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:49,110
here is that the link is the link to how

00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:53,190
to do the thing and then paired with the

00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:54,300
link is the tag so that it's clear to

00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:57,930
the person looking at it

00:08:54,300 --> 00:09:01,410
how that link got put there so the back

00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:03,209
port a Drupal core patch linked to the

00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:07,500
instructions for how to do that is there

00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:09,990
because it was tagged needs backport so

00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:12,600
there you go so that would be really

00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:13,950
great and we have issues in the cuse you

00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:18,209
can start to work on that to make that

00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:21,380
happen right away oh I shouldn't here's

00:09:18,209 --> 00:09:21,380
the close-up so you can see it better

00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:33,810
and so the issue on drupal.org is 2013

00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:42,779
22 2 and the issue in the dreaded er

00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:45,720
github issue queue is issue 16 so these

00:09:42,779 --> 00:09:47,370
instructions are all kind of named with

00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:50,910
a pattern we call them contributor task

00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:54,560
documents and there's a list of them at

00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:57,149
drupal.org / contributor dash tasks /

00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:59,640
review oh that's an example of one if

00:09:57,149 --> 00:10:01,110
you go to that one it they're all

00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:03,089
grouped there in the right-hand sidebar

00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:05,760
so you can see all of the different ones

00:10:03,089 --> 00:10:08,610
that exist that we've written anybody

00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:10,770
can add a new one so if you know of a

00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:13,079
needs tags that's missing one you can

00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:14,339
see how to improve the documentation the

00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:15,839
kind of system that we use and you can

00:10:14,339 --> 00:10:17,339
go ahead and add one you can also edit

00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:20,339
them to improve them you don't need

00:10:17,339 --> 00:10:23,190
special permission to do that um feel

00:10:20,339 --> 00:10:26,430
free it's if you have produced a patch

00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:28,649
and you want to review it's because we

00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:29,790
don't have those issues solved yet for

00:10:28,649 --> 00:10:31,829
how to automatically add these

00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:34,980
instructions it's very helpful if you

00:10:31,829 --> 00:10:36,720
find the doc cut and paste the link put

00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:38,699
it in a comment on the issue so people

00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:44,760
who find your issue can actually do the

00:10:38,699 --> 00:10:47,699
review that you so desperately want if

00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:49,440
we don't get reviews quickly the patches

00:10:47,699 --> 00:10:51,540
go stale and then we make more work for

00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,490
ourselves because we have to either fix

00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:55,800
it because Korres changed wildly in

00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:57,720
terms of approach or it's just moved a

00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,829
little bit and we have to reroll it but

00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:00,390
you don't want to do that as a patch

00:10:58,829 --> 00:11:02,730
producer you want to get somebody to

00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:05,480
review it when it's fresh it's less work

00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:05,480
for you that way

00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:12,460
if you are creating patches that are

00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,990
similar or you need to create a bunch of

00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:16,710
patches that are similar grouping them

00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:20,050
together under an meta issue actually

00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:23,820
helps you get reviews because you can

00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:26,920
have a new person find the meta issue if

00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:29,230
you put really great instructions in the

00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:31,150
meta for how to do a review because it

00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:33,550
might be like a very special topic like

00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:38,020
perhaps it's about schemas or it might

00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:40,360
be about undefined unused variables we

00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:42,810
have no metaphor that you put very

00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:45,670
specific instructions in the meta

00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:46,960
somebody who finds an issue it's linked

00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:48,850
to the meadow or they find a minutes

00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:51,010
link to the issue they'll see those

00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:53,020
instructions maybe they'll review one of

00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:54,820
them well if there's a hundred issues

00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:56,830
like that and you've written down really

00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:58,420
great instructions they're going to do a

00:11:56,830 --> 00:12:00,190
couple more they're going to review

00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:01,810
another one maybe three or four of them

00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:03,490
then they'll go on and do something else

00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:06,370
so if you have something that's very

00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:08,380
similar documenting the instructions for

00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:10,300
how to do it makes it so other people

00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:17,770
will do what you need them to do which

00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:20,890
is to review um if you've made a patch

00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:24,630
if you produced a patch and you want

00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:29,890
somebody to test it but the audience of

00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:32,140
testers of reviewers that you need is it

00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:33,820
doesn't have the dreaded er plugin

00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:35,470
installed for whatever reason perhaps

00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:38,230
their own a device that can't have

00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:42,370
dreaded her on or they don't know about

00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:44,830
it you can also build a custom URL to

00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:46,480
simply test me and you can post that

00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:49,240
either in the issue summary or in a

00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:56,170
comment and when you do that it enables

00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:58,270
people to test a patch without having a

00:12:56,170 --> 00:13:00,430
local environment so simply test me

00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:04,000
lives in the cloud you tell it which

00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:07,330
projects which module you tell it which

00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:10,600
patch you want applied to it and then

00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:12,790
anybody can test a patch and they can

00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:16,300
test it on their phone when they're on

00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:17,390
the train and if that's if they can't

00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:18,830
use us

00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:20,510
certain kind of device but they can use

00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:22,250
another one this is all hosted in the

00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:24,470
cloud and all they need is the URL that

00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:26,830
you send them you can tweet the URL you

00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:33,560
can mail it to them it's really super

00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:36,800
handy another way to get people to

00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:39,410
review your things is to give reviews

00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:40,880
like literally in terms of a trade you

00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:42,110
can just say hey I really need somebody

00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:44,030
to review this I'm willing to do

00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:49,550
anything I'll even review one of your

00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:51,560
patches and that works but whether or

00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:55,250
not you haven't won 2-1 trade the more

00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:56,900
you give reviews the better reviews that

00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:57,890
you're going to get back in return

00:13:56,900 --> 00:14:00,020
because there's going to be more

00:13:57,890 --> 00:14:02,600
examples of good reviews out there

00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:05,120
people center tend to repeat the

00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:06,410
patterns that they see happen over and

00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,870
over again not everybody is going to

00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:10,850
read the instruction the contributor

00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:13,280
tasks document on how to do a review

00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:15,260
what they're going to do is read the

00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:17,210
issues read read read they're going to

00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:18,320
get brave enough one day to do a review

00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:20,690
and they're just going to repeat what

00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:23,090
they saw other people posting so if they

00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:25,130
see people posting incomplete reviews or

00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:27,080
reviews that just say looks good or they

00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:28,520
just people just mark things are TBC

00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,990
that they're going to think that's the

00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:32,900
way to do it so we can actually improve

00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:34,790
the quality of reviews that we get by

00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:42,050
giving quality review so there's more

00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:45,320
good examples out there these things

00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:49,700
these approaches that patch producers

00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:52,280
can do actually are accomplishing the

00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:54,230
goal of helping people find their issue

00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:56,060
that needs review so you market needs

00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:58,820
review that helps them find it you tag

00:14:56,060 --> 00:15:00,470
it with tags that helps them make sure

00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:02,840
their skills are going to be useful on

00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:04,280
that thing making these easy links and

00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:07,280
these instructions are all making it

00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:08,870
easy for people to find how to do it so

00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:10,970
if you think that you might want to

00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:12,830
review something I'm going to give you

00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:14,140
some tips on how to do that what you

00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:16,220
want to do in terms of selecting

00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:17,630
something to review is you want to look

00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:20,810
for something that's really simple the

00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:22,400
first time you can look for not things

00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:25,330
that are tagged novice and if you're an

00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:28,490
IRC you can ask the question novice um

00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:30,200
and you can look for initiatives and

00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:32,960
they will often have a

00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:35,420
of things that they think need a review

00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:37,070
you can also ask them you can say I'm

00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:38,960
new I want to review something do you

00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:41,840
have anything good for a novice to

00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:43,430
review and usually initiatives have some

00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:45,890
way of bringing people in and they will

00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:47,960
help match you up with an issue in IRC

00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:49,700
the bot that lives there answers these

00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:52,100
questions these other questions are

00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:56,630
helpful to in terms of finding issues to

00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:59,330
review medes and focus so when you log

00:15:56,630 --> 00:16:01,490
into dido you can find issues to review

00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:04,970
using the novice link that's in your

00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:07,130
dashboard takes you to a page that is

00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:09,470
searches all things and it's just an

00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:12,440
active search of issues but that have

00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:14,300
the novice tag on them you're looking

00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:16,700
for something to review you can use this

00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:18,320
advanced search to customize this you

00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:20,540
can select only things that have status

00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:22,850
needs review maybe you want Drupal 8

00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:25,070
things perhaps you want to work inside a

00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:26,930
particular initiative so you can tell

00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:30,440
the needs tags filter you would like all

00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:32,510
of both novice and maybe da-mi if that's

00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:35,750
the tag for the initiative you're

00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:38,470
interested in initiatives you can find

00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:42,650
out more about them on drupal.org

00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:45,610
community dash initiatives / Drupal core

00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:47,720
for example here's what the views

00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:49,720
initiative page looks like the cool

00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:52,280
thing about this is it doesn't matter

00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:53,960
exactly what issues are listed here you

00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:55,730
can click on a couple of them and figure

00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:57,350
out what are the common tags that you're

00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:59,150
they're using with the issues that

00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:00,200
they're kind of working on right now so

00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:01,880
you just need to find anything that

00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:03,890
somebody is working on see what tags

00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:07,760
they're using and then search for some

00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:11,900
more issues with those tags sometimes

00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:15,290
issues have a lot of tags other

00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:18,230
initiatives have hubs instead of a list

00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:20,570
of issues on that page so on there's a

00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:24,620
link on the multilingual section to the

00:17:20,570 --> 00:17:26,480
multilingual hub which has a focus board

00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:27,620
on it that we use to organize our

00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:30,290
initiatives because I'm part of

00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:33,110
multilingual but other initiatives use

00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:35,120
focus boards too so if you're in IRC you

00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:37,370
can ask the robot focus and it will tell

00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:39,650
you the focus boards for lots of

00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:41,450
initiatives if you want to work on one

00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:43,040
of those meta issues where it has really

00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:44,630
good review instructions and you

00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:46,490
to kind of be productive even though you

00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:48,050
don't know all of Drupal 8 you're like

00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:50,090
well at least if I learn about this one

00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:51,950
topic in this meta there's a lot of sub

00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:54,170
issues I can do a bunch of them you can

00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:56,510
feel really productive then so you can

00:17:54,170 --> 00:18:00,920
ask it Metis and it'll help you find

00:17:56,510 --> 00:18:03,530
them some meta issues so there's a the

00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:12,190
entity field API focus board is there

00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:12,190
too so I'm out of my 15 minutes

00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:25,420
when you're giving your review it's

00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:27,290
really important that we're constructive

00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:30,200
because you could be reviewing

00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:32,270
somebody's first patch so we need to be

00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:33,950
very supportive and make it so that when

00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:35,570
they make a future patch they make it

00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:38,030
better than next time but we do it in a

00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:40,040
nice way so we were very specific in our

00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:44,150
feedback we include links to resources

00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:45,950
and standards and it's enough to ask a

00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:47,330
question you don't have to say whether

00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:49,220
or not they've used the right approach

00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:51,890
you can ask a question about the

00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:53,450
approach and the idea is to scale the

00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:56,420
community so that we all improve

00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:58,730
together dreddit er is a very handy tool

00:18:56,420 --> 00:19:01,100
it's no longer indeed I know it's on

00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:02,990
github you want to delete it out of your

00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:05,780
browser it's a browser plug-in and then

00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:08,210
use their nice just easy click button to

00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:09,890
install it when you find an issue you

00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:11,990
want to review please follow it because

00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:14,059
you will lose issues issues get lost

00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:17,809
they're like poor little puppies we have

00:19:14,059 --> 00:19:19,850
to keep track of them they might have a

00:19:17,809 --> 00:19:21,650
good issue summary if the patch producer

00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:26,630
is updated it which identifies the

00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:29,240
problem very specifically they should

00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:31,809
have steps to reproduce if they do you

00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:35,330
should thank them and also follow them

00:19:31,809 --> 00:19:38,210
simply test me is good tool to help with

00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:40,580
that my tip here is to register if you

00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:42,620
don't register your example of your

00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:44,390
patch Drupal 8 in the cloud only lasts

00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:51,679
30 minutes but you register and you get

00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:54,140
more and it's free the way the way you

00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:56,240
use it these are quick but they'll save

00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:59,210
you a little confusion you type Drupal

00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:02,840
in the search pick triple-core you want

00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:04,970
d8 you want a 28 know you went eight

00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:06,470
decks which is the bottom of the longest

00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:08,750
drop down in the world because you

00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:11,780
always want to test on head don't test

00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:13,940
on the last alpha it's weeks old we were

00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:18,500
not like that at all anymore you got you

00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:21,140
got to be on eight panics I like this

00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:23,090
tool Jing lives in the corner of my

00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:25,820
computer and it's really easy to make

00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:28,280
screenshots has this cool markup tool I

00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:31,220
would usually anything that affects the

00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:33,520
UI has to have it before and after

00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:37,480
screenshot posted in a review

00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:39,430
nice post in the issue summary sometimes

00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:41,530
even if something doesn't say that it

00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:44,920
affects the UI I like to try the patch

00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:46,510
because nobody ever actually tries it so

00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:49,600
it's good to just try things in the UI

00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:52,450
and post screenshots before and after

00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:55,300
Jing is a good tool when you have

00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:58,090
dreaded err it's really cool you get

00:20:55,300 --> 00:21:00,130
these review and simply test me buttons

00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:01,930
you always want to use the most recent

00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:04,090
patch on an issue and this can be

00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:05,860
confusing if you're new because it can

00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:07,450
be like 20 patches which one should you

00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:09,310
test scroll all the way down to the

00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:12,940
bottom you want to test the most recent

00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:16,840
one you want to find out whether or not

00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:19,720
it works it's not doing too much and it

00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:22,390
doesn't break anything the simply test

00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:25,120
me button is awesome it's really easy

00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:27,610
but if you need to test it locally it's

00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:33,360
nice to right click copy the link

00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:33,360
address you can curl it down or w get it

00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:40,000
apply it I like get apply minus minus

00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:41,680
index and the patch name and I like to

00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,180
commit it right away because a lot of

00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:45,400
times what happens is if I'm doing a

00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:47,650
review I will find some little things

00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:49,720
that need to be fixed if I've committed

00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:51,370
the patch I can go ahead and fix them

00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:53,230
when I find them and then it's really

00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:54,640
easy to do my inner diff because I'm

00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:56,890
tipping against what I've just committed

00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:58,870
it used to be like last month couple

00:21:56,890 --> 00:22:01,090
months ago I would apply the patch I

00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:03,220
would forget to commit it I would fix a

00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:04,630
bunch of things and I'm like oh crap now

00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:07,630
I have to make another branch apply the

00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:11,170
patch in there and then difficult at

00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:15,010
branch so download the patch apply it

00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:18,520
commits then make your changes or do

00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:20,080
whatever you want that's why I the other

00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:22,060
nice thing the dreaded er gives you when

00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:24,670
you attach your screenshots is an embed

00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:27,040
link which puts the image tags right in

00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:29,620
there you want to say when you write up

00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:32,080
your review how you did the review in

00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:34,600
case there's another patch posted later

00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:36,550
on the issue you don't have time to do

00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:38,650
the review some other new person can

00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:40,180
come by and do what you did they'll know

00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:43,230
how because you wrote down what you did

00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:45,760
you want to say whether or not it works

00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:47,080
it's also really great if you can test

00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:49,450
it without the patch and

00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:55,059
verify the issue exists without the

00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:58,840
patch the nude redditor is awesome you

00:22:55,059 --> 00:23:00,820
can it's just great and you should use

00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:02,620
it and the diff stats are kind of cool i

00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:03,730
learned about those somebody told me

00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:05,320
about the diff stats if you're

00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:07,990
re-rolling you want to look at the diff

00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:09,580
stats on the patch the old patch you

00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:11,710
reroll something look at the diff stats

00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:13,090
on your new patch gives you a hint about

00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:14,409
whether or not you've done it right at

00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:15,820
all because if the diff stats are

00:23:14,409 --> 00:23:18,760
radically different you probably messed

00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:20,710
it up the other kind of cool thing you

00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:22,480
can do like a sanity check is you can

00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:24,130
look at your patch and your inner div

00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:26,350
and just look at the size of them if

00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:28,450
there's zero bytes you did it wrong and

00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:37,320
if they're the same size you probably

00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:39,820
did it wrong and when you do your review

00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:40,779
number your points but you don't have to

00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:44,320
do that anymore because the new

00:23:40,779 --> 00:23:45,940
generator does it for you so it's really

00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:47,679
important that we have a strategy for

00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:49,269
how to deal with these twenty percent of

00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:51,309
our issues need review and there's like

00:23:49,269 --> 00:23:54,039
a bazillion of them and so the strategy

00:23:51,309 --> 00:23:57,700
is to scale ourselves and we do that by

00:23:54,039 --> 00:23:59,620
clearly explaining our steps even though

00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:02,200
it seems silly in a comment say how you

00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:03,789
did your review say exactly what you did

00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:05,500
if you only looked at the code and

00:24:03,789 --> 00:24:07,269
redditor say I only looked at the code

00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:09,909
and redditor if you only tried it

00:24:07,269 --> 00:24:14,620
manually say I only tried it manually

00:24:09,909 --> 00:24:16,750
that's really helpful oh and when you're

00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:18,549
done with your review it's great if you

00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:21,580
update the issue summary and if it

00:24:18,549 --> 00:24:24,100
needed a JavaScript review and you did

00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:30,279
it you can remove the tag that says

00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:31,659
needs JavaScript review oh and there's

00:24:30,279 --> 00:24:33,820
other things that we don't have time to

00:24:31,659 --> 00:24:36,159
talk about but I will because I can't

00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:39,279
not so the problem is is when you do

00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:40,720
reviews you don't want to tell the

00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:43,059
person all of the things that you found

00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:45,700
wrong because it's too overwhelming you

00:24:43,059 --> 00:24:48,760
want to tell them only the minimum stuff

00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:50,740
that we have to get fixed in order to

00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:52,750
get the patch into core the way you know

00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:56,080
what is the minimum stuff they're called

00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:58,929
core gates so it's drupal.org / core

00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:59,720
dash gates if you find something wrong

00:24:58,929 --> 00:25:01,950
and

00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:03,840
doesn't meet one of these core gates you

00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:06,210
market needs work if you find something

00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:08,610
wrong and it's a little NIT don't mark

00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:10,590
it needs work just fix it submit your

00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:12,240
own patch it's really cool then because

00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:15,480
it's probably something small and then

00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:17,570
you'll get a cork in it mention for

00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:20,130
doing a review and fixing a small thing

00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:21,840
inter tips are great i will tell you

00:25:20,130 --> 00:25:27,120
about them anytime you want you can ask

00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:32,580
me oh it's fine um and we will talk

00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:35,220
about oh this one is good ah so I got

00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:39,150
phpstorm and it totally rocks should get

00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:41,070
it I what it it identifies problems for

00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:42,809
you so you apply the patch look at it in

00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:44,460
context and it'll be like hey look at

00:25:42,809 --> 00:25:45,840
this it's wrong and then you can sound

00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:48,929
smart when you're like hey did you know

00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:52,290
you did this and then I have resources

00:25:48,929 --> 00:26:04,170
in my slides which i will post up on the

00:25:52,290 --> 00:26:07,770
session talk so yes oh yes we will find

00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:24,059
out there may be a PHP tips or something

00:26:07,770 --> 00:26:27,150
about phpstorm okay so hold on so um you

00:26:24,059 --> 00:26:31,170
guys that's it so the point of the

00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:33,900
take-home points here are people who

00:26:31,170 --> 00:26:36,900
produce patches need to know what

00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:38,760
reviewers need and reviewers need to

00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:40,950
know what to do and you have to kind of

00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:47,480
work together so the topics are linked

00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:51,390
and I want to skip to a particular slide

00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:53,400
so if anybody has any questions like

00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:57,929
about how the review process sucks and

00:26:53,400 --> 00:27:01,470
what tools we need to improve there we

00:26:57,929 --> 00:27:05,390
go you should go you should go to the

00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:05,390
microphone and complain right now

00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:15,990
I think maybe I'm gonna guess mine yes

00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:19,560
so this was one of the ideas that I had

00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:21,390
to help improve things and then I I have

00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:23,340
my other right I have another idea I'll

00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:27,330
show you 2 i'm gonna get it ready while

00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:30,170
you guys figure out if you want to

00:27:27,330 --> 00:27:35,310
suggest something or oh just gonna ask

00:27:30,170 --> 00:27:37,890
if something's gone very arty bc and

00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:39,210
then it's been reviewed by a core

00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:41,610
committer and it's gone back to needs

00:27:39,210 --> 00:27:43,830
work it's only a little thing does it

00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:48,240
then need to go back in to needs to be

00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:49,800
reviewed by someone else and then yes it

00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:53,580
seems really hard to find reviewers to

00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:57,380
do things yes so I was a little too

00:27:53,580 --> 00:28:00,090
close I'm so right so one of the common

00:27:57,380 --> 00:28:02,190
things like when we looked at that it

00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:04,440
can take a really long time to get

00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:06,570
something committed into core its

00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:08,520
dedication its patients but it's also

00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:10,350
teamwork tag-teaming so you don't have

00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:13,170
to take something all the way you can do

00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:14,940
one of the little steps and then you can

00:28:13,170 --> 00:28:16,980
ask for help or you can just hope that

00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:18,750
somebody helps those are actually okay

00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:20,430
work patterns but if it's something you

00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:22,350
care about a lot sometimes you're like

00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:24,120
oh please please can we get this in

00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:29,550
right away so you can do some things to

00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:33,540
help with that if a committer marks on

00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:36,450
previously our TBC patch needs work and

00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:39,330
you fix it and when you market needs

00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:41,580
review make a really good comment there

00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:43,110
and also update your issue summary make

00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:47,030
it clear that those concerns have been

00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:52,980
addressed say how you addressed them and

00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:55,010
when you post your patch hop in IRC post

00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:58,350
a link to the issue and you could say

00:28:55,010 --> 00:29:02,130
I've addressed the concerns of whoever

00:28:58,350 --> 00:29:03,930
I'm around for the next two hours ping

00:29:02,130 --> 00:29:07,880
me if you take a look at this and you

00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:12,380
have any questions it needs review and

00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:12,380
make sure you have an inter diff

00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:24,290
yeah that's the example i was thinking

00:29:21,559 --> 00:29:25,340
of it really simple patch that i've just

00:29:24,290 --> 00:29:27,410
been sitting around the knees with you

00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:30,110
per month or so because it you know i

00:29:27,410 --> 00:29:32,600
added the https in drupal in the link to

00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:35,660
drupal yeah dinner it was ought to be

00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:36,680
sea bass in I back teenage with you and

00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:42,190
it's been sitting in these review for

00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:45,770
months just got the extra yeah so um

00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:48,770
when you almost always post an inner div

00:29:45,770 --> 00:29:51,260
when you post a new patch the only time

00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:55,059
you normally don't is if you're

00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:58,640
re-rolling and if you're new it rerolls

00:29:55,059 --> 00:30:01,490
or it's a complicated reroll instead of

00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:03,620
an inner div you can copy and paste the

00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:06,260
conflicts and copy and paste how you

00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:08,420
resolved the conflict and that can kind

00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:10,580
of help somebody evaluate whether or not

00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:12,440
the reroll is still good so that can be

00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:15,110
helpful too so anything you can do to

00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:16,880
describe what your changes were in terms

00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:18,980
of an inner div but also words or

00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:20,690
anything else that's really helpful and

00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:23,960
then actually talking to human beings

00:30:20,690 --> 00:30:26,570
that works too you can tweet out links

00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:28,340
to your issue you can go in IRC you can

00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:32,240
go to meet ups you can come to Sprint's

00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:38,480
I know it's weird but sometimes you have

00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:42,140
to talk to people okay does anybody have

00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:44,030
any thoughts about this mock-up here do

00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:48,320
you think it's socks or it's redundant

00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:56,570
or annoying or it's great just go to the

00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:58,309
mic it's great the descriptions might be

00:30:56,570 --> 00:31:01,220
a little bit redundant you know that I

00:30:58,309 --> 00:31:03,920
like great parts but having these

00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:06,890
instructions at hand for the most

00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:10,370
important or most common tags would

00:31:06,890 --> 00:31:14,330
greatly I think make it a lot easier to

00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:16,580
follow up on all those things versus

00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:18,620
needs tests is a very common tag that is

00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:21,590
add up to a lot of things and I think if

00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:24,140
you're a newcomer running tests have no

00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:25,950
prior experience writing them outside a

00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:28,769
Drupal can be daunting

00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:31,070
you don't know where to start this

00:31:28,769 --> 00:31:35,250
prevents you from having to ask on IRC

00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:36,899
etc here is it example yes so that is

00:31:35,250 --> 00:31:39,529
one of my worries is I want to kind of

00:31:36,899 --> 00:31:42,210
reveal how these things get

00:31:39,529 --> 00:31:43,559
automatically added by kind of noting

00:31:42,210 --> 00:31:45,899
that they're paired but then there are

00:31:43,559 --> 00:31:47,700
also tags and now they're also over here

00:31:45,899 --> 00:31:50,130
and sometimes the names are also very

00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:53,190
similar so if anybody has some better

00:31:50,130 --> 00:31:55,139
ideas for that I guess if you if you put

00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:57,990
it like that you want to do this using a

00:31:55,139 --> 00:32:02,519
simple checkbox on in the issue summary

00:31:57,990 --> 00:32:04,200
but um yeah take this up with Boyan and

00:32:02,519 --> 00:32:06,659
Roy from the UX team for instance oh

00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:12,299
yeah I should market needs usability

00:32:06,659 --> 00:32:17,460
review their ask him ok i haven't had a

00:32:12,299 --> 00:32:18,960
picture i want to show you you can come

00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:27,200
up to the screen if you want to see it

00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:29,490
better ok so this is a pencil drawing

00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:31,019
you have to know the issue queue to

00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:32,700
understand this when you go to make a

00:32:31,019 --> 00:32:34,620
new comment you have the comment box

00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:36,600
where you write your comment right above

00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:38,580
that if you have dreaded er which you

00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:42,929
will all have after today if you don't

00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:46,490
already and there's a autocomplete field

00:32:42,929 --> 00:32:52,200
where you can type in tags like needs

00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:54,389
magic and my proposal here is that next

00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:57,600
to the needs tags autocomplete we put a

00:32:54,389 --> 00:33:00,120
button which says edit tags when you

00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:03,149
click the button over the top of your

00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:05,190
comment is something and it has two

00:33:03,149 --> 00:33:07,740
sections at the top are the tags that

00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:09,330
are already on the issue either with

00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:10,980
check boxes that are already checked or

00:33:09,330 --> 00:33:12,779
with X's on them so you can just click

00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:17,070
it to remove a tag instead of having to

00:33:12,779 --> 00:33:19,500
backspace to remove tags and and then

00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:22,769
under that section of our tags already

00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:28,409
on the issue is a curated list of common

00:33:22,769 --> 00:33:31,769
useful tags that are unchecked and if

00:33:28,409 --> 00:33:34,260
you check them and hit update tag button

00:33:31,769 --> 00:33:36,899
or cancel but if you hit the update tag

00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:38,659
button what happens is that window goes

00:33:36,899 --> 00:33:41,509
away the tags are added

00:33:38,659 --> 00:33:44,299
to the autocomplete and if the tag you

00:33:41,509 --> 00:33:46,220
added has a contributor task document

00:33:44,299 --> 00:33:48,950
that gets appended to the end of your

00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:50,599
comment pasted into the comment and then

00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:52,460
right before you submit your comment you

00:33:50,599 --> 00:33:55,700
have the option to take out those

00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:58,549
automatically added instructions so this

00:33:55,700 --> 00:34:03,080
is another proposal and so I'd like to

00:33:58,549 --> 00:34:04,849
have some feedback on that also Jess so

00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:06,559
last night I'm Kathy was looking at her

00:34:04,849 --> 00:34:09,139
slides and we were sitting down in the

00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:12,319
lobby of the hotel and having some

00:34:09,139 --> 00:34:13,669
beverages and Alex pot looked at the

00:34:12,319 --> 00:34:15,129
slide and common and said what was

00:34:13,669 --> 00:34:17,389
talking about how tags was a bad idea

00:34:15,129 --> 00:34:19,940
yeah and I yelled at him I was like

00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:22,309
screw you you know we worked with what

00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:26,569
we had and and I think that we solved a

00:34:22,309 --> 00:34:29,710
problem that was there but that said the

00:34:26,569 --> 00:34:34,609
Drupal 7 upgrade of drupal org is

00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:40,639
imminent apparently and in in that

00:34:34,609 --> 00:34:44,510
upgrade there's things like fields so we

00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:46,609
could have like I mean these these needs

00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:48,079
tanks that we came up with that the like

00:34:46,609 --> 00:34:49,760
things that you have to do that are part

00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:51,889
of the process of developing a patch

00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:53,929
that's not really the same as something

00:34:51,889 --> 00:34:56,510
like tagging something for the web

00:34:53,929 --> 00:34:59,119
services initiative or you know so I

00:34:56,510 --> 00:35:01,400
mean maybe something to consider is and

00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:02,960
you know in consultation with designers

00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:05,510
and in the fullness of time and so forth

00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:07,579
is you know is there a better way that

00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:09,619
we can expose our process as a separate

00:35:07,579 --> 00:35:11,930
field I mean there's already too many

00:35:09,619 --> 00:35:13,789
fields but at the same time not enough

00:35:11,930 --> 00:35:16,160
and I don't know I'm I don't know

00:35:13,789 --> 00:35:18,079
anything about usability but that's one

00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:20,750
thing to keep in mind and Elaine it does

00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:27,740
seem like the needs tags are there are

00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:29,779
different kinds of tags yeah for sure it

00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:31,910
is you know it's as some is that a most

00:35:29,779 --> 00:35:33,289
needs work and he needs review yeah

00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:34,700
which is very tricky which is the other

00:35:33,289 --> 00:35:36,200
than it can be frustrating for new

00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:37,609
contributors sometimes is they don't

00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:40,460
know which down is to pick because in

00:35:37,609 --> 00:35:42,680
fact issues are in both states and one

00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:44,569
of the ways that more experienced

00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:47,270
contributors can help make that clear is

00:35:44,569 --> 00:35:49,010
in the issue summary there's a very

00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:51,740
common section that people and sometimes

00:35:49,010 --> 00:35:52,369
which is called remaining tasks so in

00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:54,740
the remaining

00:35:52,369 --> 00:35:57,529
tas section what we can do is number

00:35:54,740 --> 00:36:00,349
them identify each item so we can say it

00:35:57,529 --> 00:36:03,349
needs a javascript review but it needs

00:36:00,349 --> 00:36:07,279
work to address the concern by Alex pot

00:36:03,349 --> 00:36:09,200
and that remaining tasks list is hand

00:36:07,279 --> 00:36:11,029
written by a human expresses the idea

00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:12,740
that something might be in both the

00:36:11,029 --> 00:36:16,819
state of needing review and needs work

00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:19,519
at the same time related to what I said

00:36:16,819 --> 00:36:21,049
before and this idea of being able to do

00:36:19,519 --> 00:36:24,259
new things with a project issue for the

00:36:21,049 --> 00:36:27,950
first time in a long time um tomorrow

00:36:24,259 --> 00:36:30,170
night okay tomorrow night um so like I

00:36:27,950 --> 00:36:33,349
said about the drupal.org d 7 upgrade

00:36:30,170 --> 00:36:35,690
being imminent and we're so we were

00:36:33,349 --> 00:36:38,539
talking about we're looking at neo

00:36:35,690 --> 00:36:40,220
because the neo is working very hard so

00:36:38,539 --> 00:36:41,990
we're talking about tomorrow so so it

00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:44,150
would be really great if people you know

00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:45,559
could like beta test it and so we're

00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:47,599
talking about tomorrow night in the

00:36:45,559 --> 00:36:48,920
lobby of the corinthia right Wednesday

00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:53,240
night Wednesday night in the lobby of

00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:56,660
the corinthia having a drupal.org user

00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:59,690
testing / drinking / music party festive

00:36:56,660 --> 00:37:01,759
fun fun time so yes we have ideas about

00:36:59,690 --> 00:37:03,980
usability if you like using issue queues

00:37:01,759 --> 00:37:07,400
if you're good at breaking things like

00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:08,569
you should come and hang out and test

00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:10,279
your blood org and have a few drinks

00:37:08,569 --> 00:37:12,970
because the best usability testing is

00:37:10,279 --> 00:37:15,799
done with alcohol I mean right like if

00:37:12,970 --> 00:37:17,119
after I I'm not I don't mean to promote

00:37:15,799 --> 00:37:18,440
alcoholism if you don't drink that's

00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:20,779
fine too you can have a tea and enjoy

00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:22,579
the music which also inspires you to pay

00:37:20,779 --> 00:37:24,440
less attention focus on just what's most

00:37:22,579 --> 00:37:26,839
sociable so I it'd be great if anyone

00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:29,450
wants to help out with that yes um there

00:37:26,839 --> 00:37:32,989
could be a guitar and the ukulele and I

00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:35,809
may write my review as lyrics so yeah

00:37:32,989 --> 00:37:37,099
it's gonna you talk about and Angie fun

00:37:35,809 --> 00:37:38,599
event and everybody should come

00:37:37,099 --> 00:37:41,359
Corinthian Wednesday night so we can

00:37:38,599 --> 00:37:43,730
review the new ddoddo interface okay so

00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:45,259
let's do one more question and then we

00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:48,650
have to talk about how to turn regular

00:37:45,259 --> 00:37:50,420
people into mentors okay um to as a

00:37:48,650 --> 00:37:51,769
follow up on those status things and

00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:55,130
that needs work it needs review for

00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:56,599
instance initial can be both states one

00:37:55,130 --> 00:37:59,829
of the things that has been annoying me

00:37:56,599 --> 00:38:03,049
a lot is that whenever you post a patch

00:37:59,829 --> 00:38:05,660
and use it to needs review and you want

00:38:03,049 --> 00:38:06,260
people to look at it the test spot does

00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:10,370
it as well

00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:12,230
that it says no your patch fails slams

00:38:10,370 --> 00:38:13,640
it back into needs work and then nobody

00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:15,320
will look at it anymore even though you

00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:17,960
just want the review for the approach

00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:22,100
you took oh that's a good point somebody

00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:24,260
write that down oh if you don't want

00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:26,090
well if you know you do but that's it's

00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:27,830
just it's both needs work and needs

00:38:26,090 --> 00:38:29,660
review rice but if you want a human to

00:38:27,830 --> 00:38:31,640
give you some advice and the trust wat

00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:34,070
so it also doesn't work so it needs work

00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:36,140
yeah I want the test review to see does

00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:37,900
it break any tests and I want the human

00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:40,340
review to see okay is this approach

00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:42,230
acceptable is does this approach solve

00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:44,390
the problem which is one can I don't

00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:46,340
want what utilities are kind of handy

00:38:44,390 --> 00:38:48,620
because the test spot might market needs

00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:50,450
work but you can still have it needs

00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:52,610
usability review because it kicks it

00:38:50,450 --> 00:38:55,490
back just to meet work people you people

00:38:52,610 --> 00:38:57,950
use that issue statuses human doing it

00:38:55,490 --> 00:38:59,450
so okay that definitely we should think

00:38:57,950 --> 00:39:07,310
about that somebody should make an issue

00:38:59,450 --> 00:39:09,200
oh okay so um yeah so a human being

00:39:07,310 --> 00:39:11,180
after the test pot comes back and says

00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:12,920
it fails a test you can still set it

00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:15,650
back to needs review I would recommend

00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:18,920
when you do that in a comment say what

00:39:15,650 --> 00:39:22,670
kind of review you're looking for I am

00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:26,950
another thought about crazy and workflow

00:39:22,670 --> 00:39:29,750
things regarding this a reviewing is

00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:31,430
let's we have computers that can do

00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:33,110
things for us the problem is that we

00:39:31,430 --> 00:39:34,790
need the humans to program them to do

00:39:33,110 --> 00:39:36,440
them for us so not everything is

00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:39,680
reasonable but there is one idea

00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:42,500
floating around if a patch is submitted

00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:45,910
and it has certain characteristics like

00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:49,430
it changes any file that is a dot jas

00:39:45,910 --> 00:39:52,430
that drupal org should be smart enough

00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:55,610
to know that that needs a javascript

00:39:52,430 --> 00:39:57,860
review or if it changes CSS that it

00:39:55,610 --> 00:40:01,400
needs a CSS review because those are

00:39:57,860 --> 00:40:03,860
sometimes not capable of being tested by

00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:06,050
the test pot and so we might need humans

00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:08,210
to look at it the people who produce the

00:40:06,050 --> 00:40:10,670
patches especially new people don't know

00:40:08,210 --> 00:40:12,550
that if they change a javascript file in

00:40:10,670 --> 00:40:15,320
their patch that they should tag it with

00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:16,910
javascript or needs javascript review

00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:18,890
and since we have computers that can

00:40:16,910 --> 00:40:19,380
detect which files we're changing in our

00:40:18,890 --> 00:40:21,210
passion

00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:25,069
that might be something that we can one

00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:27,329
day have automatically noted for us so I

00:40:25,069 --> 00:40:30,109
really want to talk about this other

00:40:27,329 --> 00:40:30,109
topic also

00:40:50,050 --> 00:40:55,200
okay I can't find the top of my window

00:40:57,990 --> 00:41:03,120
there it is it's a

00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:08,410
well that didn't work

00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:20,590
oh it's talk number two turning regular

00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:20,590
people into mentors of mentors

00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:30,830
sustainable core development through the

00:41:24,290 --> 00:41:32,840
core mentoring program so we have two

00:41:30,830 --> 00:41:34,220
topics during this core conversation and

00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:37,310
we have some new people in the room so

00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:40,130
I'm Kathy I'm glad you came by I'm the

00:41:37,310 --> 00:41:43,180
SCT on drupal.org and I'm also oh that's

00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:46,460
a lie I'm also on Twitter as yes CT I

00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:49,900
work for con press they pay me to

00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:52,490
contribute to core and it turns out I'm

00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:54,860
asking businesses to pay you to work on

00:41:52,490 --> 00:41:57,230
core might sometimes work if you want to

00:41:54,860 --> 00:42:00,140
know how I did that I can talk to you

00:41:57,230 --> 00:42:02,210
about it later and we're going to talk

00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:03,620
about how people become mentors because

00:42:02,210 --> 00:42:05,120
you don't just like come into a

00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:07,460
community and all of a sudden you are a

00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:09,470
mentor if that's interesting to you

00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:11,390
please stay but if you only wanted to

00:42:09,470 --> 00:42:13,760
hear the review part it's really ok if

00:42:11,390 --> 00:42:27,200
you'd rather go do something else it's

00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:29,630
all right so people start out as just a

00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:32,210
participant in a community they help do

00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:36,700
one thing once they tested a patch they

00:42:32,210 --> 00:42:36,700
filed an issue those are participants

00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:46,010
what we'd really like to do is to scale

00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:49,280
so we need to turn a one-time

00:42:46,010 --> 00:42:51,650
participant into a repeat participant

00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:55,190
and then we can do that by making sure

00:42:51,650 --> 00:42:57,410
that they feel welcomed making sure that

00:42:55,190 --> 00:43:00,080
they have tasks that are well matched to

00:42:57,410 --> 00:43:02,510
their skills finding issues to work on

00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:05,600
is the hardest thing for a new person to

00:43:02,510 --> 00:43:09,260
do finding a second issue to work on is

00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:11,090
still hard to do so we have one way of

00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:13,570
handling that which is directing people

00:43:11,090 --> 00:43:16,100
into core mentoring and there's I RC

00:43:13,570 --> 00:43:18,620
weekly meetings so people can

00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:22,790
participate from any part of the world

00:43:18,620 --> 00:43:25,310
there's also a very commonly now sprints

00:43:22,790 --> 00:43:29,030
at camps and calm

00:43:25,310 --> 00:43:31,010
runs on Friday and we're mentors can

00:43:29,030 --> 00:43:35,000
talk to somebody find out what they're

00:43:31,010 --> 00:43:37,910
good at and match them up with issues to

00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:41,090
work on but not everybody knows that

00:43:37,910 --> 00:43:43,040
these things are available so it we also

00:43:41,090 --> 00:43:45,560
have to figure out kind of how we can

00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:47,510
make that more transparent and

00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:50,230
integrative in the process like how do

00:43:47,510 --> 00:43:52,940
you find the next issue to work on

00:43:50,230 --> 00:43:55,040
experience contributors or initiative

00:43:52,940 --> 00:43:57,110
leads can help with that if you notice a

00:43:55,040 --> 00:44:00,140
new person has stumbled upon an issue

00:43:57,110 --> 00:44:02,090
that you that you see and they've done

00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:05,300
something useful on the issue we can

00:44:02,090 --> 00:44:07,480
thank them and we can suggest another

00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:10,700
issue they might find interesting it

00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:12,860
sounds like you're being pushy or asking

00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:14,840
people to much but they're actually

00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:17,420
really appreciative when you make a

00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:21,020
suggestion of a similar issue of a

00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:23,030
similar skill a difficulty level but

00:44:21,020 --> 00:44:24,470
maybe a little bit harder they actually

00:44:23,030 --> 00:44:28,280
will say thank you for telling me

00:44:24,470 --> 00:44:33,910
something to go do because I can't find

00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:37,280
anything to do once people are repeat a

00:44:33,910 --> 00:44:39,950
participant's and we want to turn them

00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:43,810
into mentors and we can do this by

00:44:39,950 --> 00:44:45,800
mentoring in public because habitual

00:44:43,810 --> 00:44:47,660
participants are hanging around the

00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:49,400
community a lot they're looking at what

00:44:47,660 --> 00:44:51,290
people are saying in IRC they're seeing

00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:54,740
how people are interacting in the issue

00:44:51,290 --> 00:44:57,170
queues and when more experienced people

00:44:54,740 --> 00:45:00,260
other mentors are around if their

00:44:57,170 --> 00:45:02,240
mentoring in public in pound drupal not

00:45:00,260 --> 00:45:04,250
in private but in pound Drupal or

00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:06,020
they're doing it actually on an issue

00:45:04,250 --> 00:45:10,070
they're doing their mentoring on an

00:45:06,020 --> 00:45:12,770
issue there accidentally training people

00:45:10,070 --> 00:45:14,390
who aren't mentors though the people who

00:45:12,770 --> 00:45:15,740
are hanging around just working on a lot

00:45:14,390 --> 00:45:18,350
of issues they happen to see a

00:45:15,740 --> 00:45:21,920
conversation take place and that has

00:45:18,350 --> 00:45:25,070
like this subtle social change in

00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:27,110
people's brains and then all of a sudden

00:45:25,070 --> 00:45:28,670
they're like they start to repeat that

00:45:27,110 --> 00:45:31,190
pattern themselves even if they don't

00:45:28,670 --> 00:45:36,760
officially become a mentor so mentoring

00:45:31,190 --> 00:45:36,760
in public is really important um

00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:42,850
this is a picture of a shadowy spy it's

00:45:40,420 --> 00:45:54,010
so shadowy we can't even tell they're

00:45:42,850 --> 00:45:56,650
there and so when we do that mentoring

00:45:54,010 --> 00:45:59,080
in public it's like we're subversively

00:45:56,650 --> 00:46:02,490
training everybody to be mentors so

00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:02,490
we're being a little covert about it

00:46:04,740 --> 00:46:09,040
then people still need a little push

00:46:07,060 --> 00:46:11,020
though so they've seen this they've

00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:14,740
experienced it then they know how it

00:46:11,020 --> 00:46:17,230
happens and one day a mentor will be too

00:46:14,740 --> 00:46:20,080
busy to do something and what they'll do

00:46:17,230 --> 00:46:23,230
is just ask somebody to do it so that

00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:26,710
happened to me this weekend I was

00:46:23,230 --> 00:46:28,240
mentoring or trying to work on something

00:46:26,710 --> 00:46:30,550
else and mentor at the same time was

00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:33,550
just overwhelmed and there was somebody

00:46:30,550 --> 00:46:35,410
that had been work had worked on like

00:46:33,550 --> 00:46:38,230
three issues that day so they were a

00:46:35,410 --> 00:46:40,750
habitual participant they had been in

00:46:38,230 --> 00:46:43,030
the room where I was mentoring so they

00:46:40,750 --> 00:46:45,550
had accidentally seen how to mentor I

00:46:43,030 --> 00:46:48,340
had unconsciously trained them and I got

00:46:45,550 --> 00:46:52,510
too busy so I just said to them could

00:46:48,340 --> 00:46:55,150
you please help this person so I asked

00:46:52,510 --> 00:47:05,020
them and they did it and now Walla their

00:46:55,150 --> 00:47:08,050
mentor if so many mentors once we really

00:47:05,020 --> 00:47:11,440
want them to like that experience not be

00:47:08,050 --> 00:47:15,070
stressed out or scared by it and become

00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:17,830
a habitual mentor so to do that that

00:47:15,070 --> 00:47:20,680
impromptu mentor we can make that

00:47:17,830 --> 00:47:23,290
conversion happen by remaining a

00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:25,150
resource for them so it wasn't like hey

00:47:23,290 --> 00:47:27,460
I want you to mentor this room now and

00:47:25,150 --> 00:47:30,670
I'm going to go get lunch and go watch a

00:47:27,460 --> 00:47:33,250
movie no it was I help these three

00:47:30,670 --> 00:47:34,720
people I'm going to be right here if you

00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:36,820
get confused or you don't know how to

00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:38,620
help them just come ask me so they're

00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:39,610
doing this mentoring thing but I'm going

00:47:38,620 --> 00:47:41,620
to make sure they have a really good

00:47:39,610 --> 00:47:44,020
experience and that they feel empowered

00:47:41,620 --> 00:47:44,510
and capable as a mentor by kind of

00:47:44,020 --> 00:47:46,460
hanging your

00:47:44,510 --> 00:47:53,390
round and being there in case they get

00:47:46,460 --> 00:47:55,640
stuck on something maybe they turn into

00:47:53,390 --> 00:47:57,590
a habitual mentor at the next event they

00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:59,840
have they've had this good experience

00:47:57,590 --> 00:48:02,960
mentorian they knew they were supported

00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:05,180
and they might actually volunteer find

00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:06,860
the conference organizer and say I

00:48:05,180 --> 00:48:10,100
mentored before at this other sprint do

00:48:06,860 --> 00:48:13,070
you need any mentors and now um they're

00:48:10,100 --> 00:48:16,580
going to become a habitual mentor over

00:48:13,070 --> 00:48:19,160
and over and we want those people not to

00:48:16,580 --> 00:48:24,350
just be mentors but we need to have them

00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:27,110
start turning people themselves it's not

00:48:24,350 --> 00:48:31,280
enough we need some people to mentor the

00:48:27,110 --> 00:48:32,480
mentors and so the way to do that is if

00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:35,720
you have a mentor that you've worked

00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:37,580
with and you see that they're doing a

00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:40,640
good job at mentoring you can tell them

00:48:37,580 --> 00:48:43,370
what they've done good and then a new

00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:45,500
mentor comes up and and says hey I'm a

00:48:43,370 --> 00:48:48,700
new mentor I'd like to mentor you can be

00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:50,750
like wait new mentor experienced mentor

00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:53,180
experienced mentor you're now a mentor

00:48:50,750 --> 00:48:56,090
of mentors would you please go show this

00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:57,410
new mentor how to use the tools explain

00:48:56,090 --> 00:48:59,210
to them some of the things that you've

00:48:57,410 --> 00:49:01,640
found really helpful when you're dealing

00:48:59,210 --> 00:49:04,700
with people and now you have a mentor of

00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:07,520
mentors while we're doing all of this

00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:09,920
stuff we want to expose how we know how

00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:11,510
to do things so people don't think that

00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:13,610
we're magically smart we show them the

00:49:11,510 --> 00:49:18,730
resources that we use how we track

00:49:13,610 --> 00:49:18,730
things the cool tricks that we have we

00:49:18,910 --> 00:49:28,190
support them we make jokes together we

00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:29,450
go out to dinner we help each other with

00:49:28,190 --> 00:49:34,070
maybe something that doesn't even

00:49:29,450 --> 00:49:36,710
involve mentoring directly um and you

00:49:34,070 --> 00:49:40,790
build relationships with people and then

00:49:36,710 --> 00:49:42,740
what happens is they start to want to be

00:49:40,790 --> 00:49:45,650
in the place where all this magic

00:49:42,740 --> 00:49:47,000
happens because it's it's fun and it's

00:49:45,650 --> 00:49:53,750
great and they get a lot out of it

00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:57,170
technically um socially and that happens

00:49:53,750 --> 00:49:58,309
when when we're nice and when we expose

00:49:57,170 --> 00:50:02,089
our reasonings so it's

00:49:58,309 --> 00:50:06,380
really about people and other people and

00:50:02,089 --> 00:50:10,069
getting together so that's a quick

00:50:06,380 --> 00:50:13,729
overview of some ideas of how to turn

00:50:10,069 --> 00:50:16,160
regular people not yet participants or

00:50:13,729 --> 00:50:18,859
just first time participants one day

00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:21,170
into being a mentor of mentors and I

00:50:18,859 --> 00:50:23,420
could tell you quite embarrassing

00:50:21,170 --> 00:50:26,150
stories about my particular journey

00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:28,789
along that way and all the mistakes that

00:50:26,150 --> 00:50:31,339
I've made and that would inspire you to

00:50:28,789 --> 00:50:33,319
see that that you have the

00:50:31,339 --> 00:50:37,059
qualifications to in fact become a

00:50:33,319 --> 00:50:39,529
mentor of mentors yourself um and I'm

00:50:37,059 --> 00:50:41,109
you can ask me any time I would love to

00:50:39,529 --> 00:50:45,949
tell embarrassing stories about myself

00:50:41,109 --> 00:50:48,579
yeah so um right now though we're gonna

00:50:45,949 --> 00:50:51,920
do questions and suggestions a

00:50:48,579 --> 00:50:54,259
brainstorm about the process complain

00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:55,219
about experiences that you've had and

00:50:54,259 --> 00:50:56,630
what we might be able to do but

00:50:55,219 --> 00:50:58,519
different in the future to make sure

00:50:56,630 --> 00:51:00,949
that those don't happen while we're

00:50:58,519 --> 00:51:05,630
doing that if you could please find this

00:51:00,949 --> 00:51:08,569
session on the schedule and give some

00:51:05,630 --> 00:51:11,150
feedback and that would really help us

00:51:08,569 --> 00:51:13,400
in future cons decide what topics you

00:51:11,150 --> 00:51:17,539
find useful or how to make them even

00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:20,509
more useful for you so you go just to

00:51:17,539 --> 00:51:23,420
the schedule page and find the talk and

00:51:20,509 --> 00:51:24,799
there you go so the questions and

00:51:23,420 --> 00:51:28,969
answers here so I want to know if you

00:51:24,799 --> 00:51:32,029
have any answers to any suggestions for

00:51:28,969 --> 00:51:34,130
new things that we can do and if nobody

00:51:32,029 --> 00:51:37,249
has any like wild brainstorming great

00:51:34,130 --> 00:51:38,809
ideas and you can ask me questions and I

00:51:37,249 --> 00:51:41,170
can answer those we can actually do them

00:51:38,809 --> 00:51:41,170
in any order

00:51:58,230 --> 00:52:05,160
you're so shy who's been a mentor ah yes

00:52:03,330 --> 00:52:08,640
let's let's get things started like that

00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:10,410
who's ever participated in a mentor

00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:13,530
sprint as I mentor and how people get

00:52:10,410 --> 00:52:15,540
started I've been a mentor that's not

00:52:13,530 --> 00:52:18,600
too many okay we have a lot a lot of

00:52:15,540 --> 00:52:21,990
potential okay hold on it's a third of

00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:23,460
the room and we have maybe 25 people I'm

00:52:21,990 --> 00:52:25,650
looking at this as potential you know

00:52:23,460 --> 00:52:29,070
I'm telling for the people I can't um

00:52:25,650 --> 00:52:31,560
not everybody can see the room who wants

00:52:29,070 --> 00:52:35,420
to be or is planning to mentor this week

00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:37,890
on Friday Oh who's mentoring on Friday

00:52:35,420 --> 00:52:40,650
okay I there are a few hands not raised

00:52:37,890 --> 00:52:43,010
why I'd like to know so it turns out

00:52:40,650 --> 00:52:45,390
that we have this big sprint on Friday

00:52:43,010 --> 00:52:48,180
hundreds of people are going to come and

00:52:45,390 --> 00:52:50,670
want to communicate communicate they're

00:52:48,180 --> 00:52:51,780
gonna want to contribute and we can help

00:52:50,670 --> 00:52:54,390
make sure that they have a good

00:52:51,780 --> 00:52:56,400
experience by providing mentors that

00:52:54,390 --> 00:52:59,490
help them through that process so that

00:52:56,400 --> 00:53:01,740
when they go home they or when they come

00:52:59,490 --> 00:53:03,630
to the next event they contribute again

00:53:01,740 --> 00:53:05,460
and the cool thing about that is what we

00:53:03,630 --> 00:53:07,140
end up in the end is a better Drupal

00:53:05,460 --> 00:53:10,109
because we have people who are helping

00:53:07,140 --> 00:53:12,060
to make it better and like so if you

00:53:10,109 --> 00:53:14,880
come to a sprint and you fix something

00:53:12,060 --> 00:53:16,859
that's cool that was good if you come to

00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:18,960
a sprint and you help eight people fix

00:53:16,859 --> 00:53:20,700
something and three of those people

00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:23,100
continue to fix things in the future

00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:25,770
you've now become more productive in

00:53:23,100 --> 00:53:27,780
your work because you fixed three times

00:53:25,770 --> 00:53:31,050
as many things even though you haven't

00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:33,510
fixed anything so we have all these

00:53:31,050 --> 00:53:37,380
people coming we need about 50 mentors

00:53:33,510 --> 00:53:39,150
and we have 27 signed up so the

00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:42,300
beginning of this talk where you get

00:53:39,150 --> 00:53:44,100
some idea for how maybe you've reviewed

00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:46,230
things before or produced a patch before

00:53:44,100 --> 00:53:48,600
but you some of these tips you thought

00:53:46,230 --> 00:53:50,400
oh that's a good tip so what you can do

00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:53,280
is you can come to the sprint on Friday

00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:55,560
and you can share those tips with people

00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:58,320
who maybe work at this talk or your own

00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:59,850
tips with people you don't have to go

00:53:58,320 --> 00:54:01,680
through special training in order to

00:53:59,850 --> 00:54:04,500
show up on friday and come up to me and

00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:06,869
say Kathy I was totally inspired by your

00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:10,590
awesome talk I'd really like a yellow

00:54:06,869 --> 00:54:11,620
t-shirt can i mentor we did it yellow

00:54:10,590 --> 00:54:13,210
t-shirt you

00:54:11,620 --> 00:54:16,030
getting yellow t-shirt when you say

00:54:13,210 --> 00:54:18,760
accepted in the first place just just

00:54:16,030 --> 00:54:21,040
one one question I wonder maybe it's

00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:23,470
about the definition of being a mentor

00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:26,200
because i plan to come on friday on the

00:54:23,470 --> 00:54:30,730
sprint and i plan to get some work done

00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:33,340
or gets get really into it at coding

00:54:30,730 --> 00:54:35,560
some stuff and surely i'm going to be

00:54:33,340 --> 00:54:38,950
supportive you someone beside me it

00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:41,140
needs to set up an Apache or whatever it

00:54:38,950 --> 00:54:43,600
does this qualify me as soon as a mentor

00:54:41,140 --> 00:54:45,520
just I will be there and will be

00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:47,140
supportive but I won't run around

00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:49,840
telling anybody right I'm the one with

00:54:47,140 --> 00:54:52,060
the yellow just asked me I know bearing

00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:56,550
nothing right what's your name George

00:54:52,060 --> 00:54:58,330
George and so that's you have two

00:54:56,550 --> 00:55:02,380
interesting things that you've brought

00:54:58,330 --> 00:55:03,850
brought up and one is you're coming to

00:55:02,380 --> 00:55:05,320
this print on Friday you'd like to get

00:55:03,850 --> 00:55:07,750
some work done and you don't mind

00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:09,670
helping some other people also one of

00:55:07,750 --> 00:55:11,800
the things you can do on Friday is you

00:55:09,670 --> 00:55:15,100
can work half of the day you can tell me

00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:16,660
I'll mentor for the first half but I

00:55:15,100 --> 00:55:18,820
really want to get some things done so

00:55:16,660 --> 00:55:20,500
after lunch I'm going to sprint or you

00:55:18,820 --> 00:55:25,060
can do it the other way around I will

00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:29,410
say that's great that the other thing is

00:55:25,060 --> 00:55:31,570
um one of the cool we have extended

00:55:29,410 --> 00:55:33,250
Sprint's around cons now it's kind of a

00:55:31,570 --> 00:55:35,650
thing we also have them around big

00:55:33,250 --> 00:55:37,930
events like bad camp and dev days and

00:55:35,650 --> 00:55:39,940
the nice they're like usually two days

00:55:37,930 --> 00:55:41,530
before two days after or something like

00:55:39,940 --> 00:55:44,890
that the cool thing about that is like

00:55:41,530 --> 00:55:47,680
the hardcore people who like just want

00:55:44,890 --> 00:55:49,150
to work and they can't like they're like

00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:52,000
you know they just feel bad when they're

00:55:49,150 --> 00:55:54,880
not working at a sprint it's a little

00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:56,740
bit easier to deal with that if you can

00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:58,900
say to yourself I can mentor on Friday

00:55:56,740 --> 00:56:00,940
because I can sprint on saturday and

00:55:58,900 --> 00:56:02,560
sunday and so saturday and sunday

00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:04,510
instead of hundreds of people there's

00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:06,660
like 50 people and they're mostly people

00:56:04,510 --> 00:56:09,460
who know what they're doing so the

00:56:06,660 --> 00:56:11,050
there's not as much need for a mentor

00:56:09,460 --> 00:56:13,210
and so people can get more work done so

00:56:11,050 --> 00:56:15,820
you might be more willing to mentor on

00:56:13,210 --> 00:56:17,830
friday if you were planning to also stay

00:56:15,820 --> 00:56:19,570
for the sprint on saturday it doesn't

00:56:17,830 --> 00:56:21,880
help you today when your plane leaves on

00:56:19,570 --> 00:56:24,150
friday at six o'clock but the next

00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:27,569
drupalcon or the dead days

00:56:24,150 --> 00:56:30,839
or bad camp or wherever you are plan to

00:56:27,569 --> 00:56:32,819
stay longer than the event I guarantee

00:56:30,839 --> 00:56:36,900
you people are sprinting the days before

00:56:32,819 --> 00:56:40,079
and after I will be because I'm entering

00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:42,000
on the day when we do the thing so the

00:56:40,079 --> 00:56:44,099
other interesting thing that you brought

00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:46,799
up is what is the definition of a mentor

00:56:44,099 --> 00:56:48,680
so for friday the definition of when you

00:56:46,799 --> 00:56:52,549
are mentoring and when you're sprinting

00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:55,020
for me like one of the clear signals is

00:56:52,549 --> 00:56:58,230
mentors usually are walking around

00:56:55,020 --> 00:57:01,470
wearing a shirt that easily identifies

00:56:58,230 --> 00:57:03,089
them as somebody who anybody can bug so

00:57:01,470 --> 00:57:04,349
you see a mentor walking around and

00:57:03,089 --> 00:57:07,140
you're sprinting and you have a question

00:57:04,349 --> 00:57:10,770
you know you can interrupt that person

00:57:07,140 --> 00:57:13,650
and that they will help you there's

00:57:10,770 --> 00:57:16,470
another kind of Mentor both on Friday

00:57:13,650 --> 00:57:19,079
and also always in the community at the

00:57:16,470 --> 00:57:21,359
same time and those are camouflaged

00:57:19,079 --> 00:57:23,520
mentors they don't wear yellow shirts

00:57:21,359 --> 00:57:26,400
they sit at the table next to you

00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:29,069
working quietly but are really willing

00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:32,430
to help you if you if you just ask them

00:57:29,069 --> 00:57:35,789
so I was reviewing this thing and I've

00:57:32,430 --> 00:57:38,480
never seen this before should I should I

00:57:35,789 --> 00:57:41,279
correct it should I mention it it and

00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:44,010
they'll this experienced person sitting

00:57:41,279 --> 00:57:46,859
next to them will totally mentor right

00:57:44,010 --> 00:57:49,349
like ever but like it happens all of the

00:57:46,859 --> 00:57:53,369
time injuries is keynote when he put

00:57:49,349 --> 00:57:55,799
those community people up there right he

00:57:53,369 --> 00:57:58,349
mentioned me from entering but what he

00:57:55,799 --> 00:58:01,079
didn't mention is all of all of those

00:57:58,349 --> 00:58:04,609
other people up there are mentors mm-hmm

00:58:01,079 --> 00:58:09,000
every single one of them bird ear

00:58:04,609 --> 00:58:14,039
mentors all the time but he doesn't wear

00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:15,510
yellow shirt right so that's the cool

00:58:14,039 --> 00:58:17,789
that's the other cool thing about the

00:58:15,510 --> 00:58:20,309
like the covert mentoring right like

00:58:17,789 --> 00:58:23,339
when you do mentoring in public people

00:58:20,309 --> 00:58:25,049
who are participating a lot they start

00:58:23,339 --> 00:58:26,579
to pick up these mentoring things and

00:58:25,049 --> 00:58:28,710
they start to do them so like when you

00:58:26,579 --> 00:58:29,940
say like how do you define mentor like

00:58:28,710 --> 00:58:33,990
it's actually kind of an interesting

00:58:29,940 --> 00:58:35,579
question I also wanted to respond to

00:58:33,990 --> 00:58:36,970
what you said with regard to the point

00:58:35,579 --> 00:58:39,310
about you know I can

00:58:36,970 --> 00:58:40,390
people set up an Apache stack but you

00:58:39,310 --> 00:58:41,800
know I don't I might not know the

00:58:40,390 --> 00:58:43,000
answers to their other questions and so

00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:46,240
maybe I can't do the whole mentoring

00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:48,400
thing that's wrong you can because the

00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:49,960
most important discovery I think that I

00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:51,640
made is that you don't have to know

00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:55,150
everything you don't even have to know a

00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:57,490
lot for anyone i haven't met I'm I'm

00:58:55,150 --> 00:58:58,990
Jess I'm xjm and I kind of sort of

00:58:57,490 --> 00:59:02,920
started the core mentoring program kind

00:58:58,990 --> 00:59:05,770
of sort of absolutely did and she met so

00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:09,910
she is a mentor of mentors I'm a mentor

00:59:05,770 --> 00:59:12,010
of Metro some doors she turned me into I

00:59:09,910 --> 00:59:15,460
meant like she took me through that

00:59:12,010 --> 00:59:18,220
process right so she's my mentor so that

00:59:15,460 --> 00:59:20,560
the thing is when I started in 2011 I

00:59:18,220 --> 00:59:22,840
didn't know what the hell I was doing I

00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:25,000
was such a noob it was ridiculous how

00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:28,060
much of a noob I was but I just was like

00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:29,230
I was willing to be wrong and I took the

00:59:28,060 --> 00:59:31,660
things that I did know how to do and

00:59:29,230 --> 00:59:33,730
help people do those things and so like

00:59:31,660 --> 00:59:35,349
when you're at a sprint especially you

00:59:33,730 --> 00:59:36,820
know but also when we do mentoring did

00:59:35,349 --> 00:59:39,220
you talk about IRC mentoring when I was

00:59:36,820 --> 00:59:40,510
late maybe a little bit ok we have IRC

00:59:39,220 --> 00:59:42,099
mentoring it's twice a week you can

00:59:40,510 --> 00:59:43,960
google it or you can follow Drupal

00:59:42,099 --> 00:59:45,910
mentoring on Twitter and I tweet when

00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:47,800
mentoring hours start and I else should

00:59:45,910 --> 00:59:49,119
totally follow Drupal mentor you totally

00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:51,070
should follow a triple mentoring on

00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:53,950
Twitter all one word so in both those

00:59:51,070 --> 00:59:55,750
scenarios you don't you're like you can

00:59:53,950 --> 00:59:57,700
ask other people like Cathy's are there

00:59:55,750 --> 00:59:59,470
already 27 mentors there and it's going

00:59:57,700 --> 01:00:01,720
to be busy and crazy but on the other

00:59:59,470 --> 01:00:04,180
hand both when you do mentoring in

01:00:01,720 --> 01:00:06,099
person enters print or online or even in

01:00:04,180 --> 01:00:07,599
like not a formal setting I could defer

01:00:06,099 --> 01:00:09,099
mention but just as like stuff that

01:00:07,599 --> 01:00:10,270
happens in the issue queue it's totally

01:00:09,099 --> 01:00:13,270
okay to be like you know I don't know

01:00:10,270 --> 01:00:15,970
but I may be Cathy knows someone who

01:00:13,270 --> 01:00:18,130
knows the answer or like oh you know I

01:00:15,970 --> 01:00:19,660
know that there's this guy over there

01:00:18,130 --> 01:00:21,400
who's like looks like he's working right

01:00:19,660 --> 01:00:22,750
now but it's a really technical question

01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:24,970
I think he know the answer so let's go

01:00:22,750 --> 01:00:27,190
there so it's more about just like help

01:00:24,970 --> 01:00:28,420
giving someone some someone to ask and

01:00:27,190 --> 01:00:30,220
then pointing them in the right

01:00:28,420 --> 01:00:32,050
direction because there's going to be

01:00:30,220 --> 01:00:33,880
this huge volume of people who are just

01:00:32,050 --> 01:00:35,140
looking for someone to just give them a

01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:36,700
nudge and so if you can give them that

01:00:35,140 --> 01:00:38,080
nudge and then just say oh you know what

01:00:36,700 --> 01:00:40,270
I don't know how to answer that question

01:00:38,080 --> 01:00:41,980
but let me ask someone else who can and

01:00:40,270 --> 01:00:44,770
find someone to help you that is HUGE

01:00:41,980 --> 01:00:47,140
another thing that that Cathy and Andrea

01:00:44,770 --> 01:00:49,000
did at drupalcon Portland which was

01:00:47,140 --> 01:00:50,500
really valuable is they had a couple

01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:52,830
people out in front of the sprint

01:00:50,500 --> 01:00:55,060
who's just spent a couple hours just

01:00:52,830 --> 01:00:57,070
organizing people like saying this is

01:00:55,060 --> 01:00:58,480
where you need to go if like asking

01:00:57,070 --> 01:00:59,890
people what's your skill set you know do

01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:01,660
you need to have set up a deaf sec oh

01:00:59,890 --> 01:01:02,920
you do then go to the workshop oh you

01:01:01,660 --> 01:01:05,290
don't well maybe you want to go in here

01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:06,430
and just sort of like coordinating back

01:01:05,290 --> 01:01:09,370
and forth they were like they were like

01:01:06,430 --> 01:01:11,230
greeters and like traffic cops see what

01:01:09,370 --> 01:01:15,670
happens sometimes in a sprint hostess at

01:01:11,230 --> 01:01:17,020
restaurant is people first of all don't

01:01:15,670 --> 01:01:18,970
think that they're smart enough to come

01:01:17,020 --> 01:01:20,440
to Sprint's but what happens is that we

01:01:18,970 --> 01:01:21,640
talk about it all the time how much fun

01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:23,290
it is and we keep telling them so

01:01:21,640 --> 01:01:25,060
eventually one time they like walk down

01:01:23,290 --> 01:01:27,070
the hall towards a sprint but they're

01:01:25,060 --> 01:01:28,870
still really nervous if they don't know

01:01:27,070 --> 01:01:31,900
where to go or what to do immediately

01:01:28,870 --> 01:01:33,910
they leave I mean it's tempting right

01:01:31,900 --> 01:01:36,250
cuz what is your choice hold up in a

01:01:33,910 --> 01:01:37,810
room where a scary experience something

01:01:36,250 --> 01:01:39,310
totally new to you is going to happen

01:01:37,810 --> 01:01:42,190
that you may not enjoy or you could go

01:01:39,310 --> 01:01:44,530
to the castle in pronk rightly so it's

01:01:42,190 --> 01:01:48,070
easy to turn around and just leave right

01:01:44,530 --> 01:01:51,100
or get up and go so having somebody

01:01:48,070 --> 01:01:53,200
smile and say I'm high yes you're in the

01:01:51,100 --> 01:01:55,000
rice place this is the sprint oh oh

01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:57,010
you've done that but you haven't done

01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:59,320
that I know exactly who you need to talk

01:01:57,010 --> 01:02:01,360
to and where to go come with me go here

01:01:59,320 --> 01:02:02,770
so we don't like put handcuffs on them

01:02:01,360 --> 01:02:06,130
and like drag them to where they need to

01:02:02,770 --> 01:02:10,360
go right Mike where we entice them and

01:02:06,130 --> 01:02:13,570
we make it so easy that why wouldn't you

01:02:10,360 --> 01:02:16,870
do it right and the thing about not

01:02:13,570 --> 01:02:19,120
being skilled and I remember like just

01:02:16,870 --> 01:02:21,430
being the maintainer of taxonomy access

01:02:19,120 --> 01:02:22,960
control and I remember like they I don't

01:02:21,430 --> 01:02:24,910
I say I remember like you were starting

01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:26,740
out by like doing like reviews and stuff

01:02:24,910 --> 01:02:28,900
and now she can do all these cool things

01:02:26,740 --> 01:02:32,350
but the reason she can do all these cool

01:02:28,900 --> 01:02:33,880
one of the reasons she and I can do more

01:02:32,350 --> 01:02:36,580
things way more things than I could

01:02:33,880 --> 01:02:39,040
before is because I mentored then what

01:02:36,580 --> 01:02:41,950
happens when you mentor is forces you

01:02:39,040 --> 01:02:43,930
kind of like outside of your skills into

01:02:41,950 --> 01:02:46,420
others because I don't talk to a new

01:02:43,930 --> 01:02:49,150
participant and say let me tell you what

01:02:46,420 --> 01:02:53,620
I'm good at and let me help you find an

01:02:49,150 --> 01:02:56,470
issue that I know about okay sometimes I

01:02:53,620 --> 01:02:58,510
do but um but what I do is I talk to

01:02:56,470 --> 01:03:00,280
them so I'm gonna talk to somebody who

01:02:58,510 --> 01:03:02,799
knows something I don't know anything

01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:04,779
about but I'm the mentor

01:03:02,799 --> 01:03:06,279
so then I have to find an issue for them

01:03:04,779 --> 01:03:07,599
to work on figure out what the issue

01:03:06,279 --> 01:03:09,009
needs because they're not going to solve

01:03:07,599 --> 01:03:11,259
the whole issue they're only going to do

01:03:09,009 --> 01:03:13,989
one part and we do that together I can

01:03:11,259 --> 01:03:16,449
even show them how I find an issue to

01:03:13,989 --> 01:03:18,519
work on so I'm exposing that to them

01:03:16,449 --> 01:03:21,400
because they don't know and then

01:03:18,519 --> 01:03:23,529
together we have to figure out how to do

01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:25,959
that thing and then we have to figure

01:03:23,529 --> 01:03:27,699
out how to know how to do that thing and

01:03:25,959 --> 01:03:29,499
we do it together and in the end they're

01:03:27,699 --> 01:03:31,390
happy because now they know how to go

01:03:29,499 --> 01:03:33,749
off on their own and how to do all of

01:03:31,390 --> 01:03:37,390
these things in their area of interest

01:03:33,749 --> 01:03:39,759
but I'm accidentally forced to get a new

01:03:37,390 --> 01:03:42,609
skill and now I know how to do that

01:03:39,759 --> 01:03:44,949
thing too but what I have sat down at

01:03:42,609 --> 01:03:48,209
home by myself and said you know what

01:03:44,949 --> 01:03:52,779
I'm really gonna figure out local task

01:03:48,209 --> 01:03:54,999
routing yamo things like yeah no I'm not

01:03:52,779 --> 01:03:57,880
gonna like that's not my idea of a fun

01:03:54,999 --> 01:04:00,729
evening by myself frustrated when I

01:03:57,880 --> 01:04:04,809
can't find examples they don't work done

01:04:00,729 --> 01:04:07,630
it up but somehow when I mentor somebody

01:04:04,809 --> 01:04:09,400
who wants to work on that and we're

01:04:07,630 --> 01:04:13,839
doing it together and we're interacting

01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:15,640
oh it's just more fun and now I know

01:04:13,839 --> 01:04:18,910
these things that I didn't know before

01:04:15,640 --> 01:04:21,309
and so you don't have to know a lot when

01:04:18,910 --> 01:04:24,179
you mentor you just you just kind of

01:04:21,309 --> 01:04:27,489
have to do it and then over time it's

01:04:24,179 --> 01:04:29,650
amazing you it's like it we say that

01:04:27,489 --> 01:04:32,410
companies should encourage their

01:04:29,650 --> 01:04:34,689
employees to contribute because when

01:04:32,410 --> 01:04:37,329
they contribute to core their work gets

01:04:34,689 --> 01:04:39,219
reviewed they learn how to do their work

01:04:37,329 --> 01:04:43,059
better what it doesn't matter what it is

01:04:39,219 --> 01:04:45,069
you know mocking you eyes or making

01:04:43,059 --> 01:04:48,759
suggestions about possible solutions or

01:04:45,069 --> 01:04:49,900
writing code whatever you do somebody is

01:04:48,759 --> 01:04:51,880
going to point out what you've done

01:04:49,900 --> 01:04:53,140
wrong you're going to discuss it you're

01:04:51,880 --> 01:04:54,789
going to figure out who's really wrong

01:04:53,140 --> 01:04:56,679
and how to do it better and we make that

01:04:54,789 --> 01:04:58,869
argument for companies all the time for

01:04:56,679 --> 01:05:00,999
participating but it turns out the same

01:04:58,869 --> 01:05:03,249
thing is true for mentoring companies

01:05:00,999 --> 01:05:04,989
can pay their people to mentor we

01:05:03,249 --> 01:05:07,599
haven't tried this yet but I don't know

01:05:04,989 --> 01:05:10,179
public companies can pay their people to

01:05:07,599 --> 01:05:11,859
mentor and the biscuit the company gets

01:05:10,179 --> 01:05:13,779
the same effect what do they get back

01:05:11,859 --> 01:05:15,880
when that person returns to work

01:05:13,779 --> 01:05:16,280
somebody who knows a whole heck of a lot

01:05:15,880 --> 01:05:20,330
about

01:05:16,280 --> 01:05:22,430
a lot more things so you don't have to

01:05:20,330 --> 01:05:30,740
initially know things you just have to

01:05:22,430 --> 01:05:32,450
show up I'm back but people didn't know

01:05:30,740 --> 01:05:37,010
me yet I have introduced myself I'm Bart

01:05:32,450 --> 01:05:40,220
Santa with an X on drupal.org I'd like

01:05:37,010 --> 01:05:42,890
to share three short experiences from my

01:05:40,220 --> 01:05:45,260
two-times mentoring triple cons Munich

01:05:42,890 --> 01:05:48,590
and Portland one of them you may already

01:05:45,260 --> 01:05:50,320
have heard in the previews valve so I

01:05:48,590 --> 01:05:54,200
started mentoring in a few minutes

01:05:50,320 --> 01:05:56,090
trimco Munich last year I stayed for the

01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:57,680
Sprint's but I had never touched Drupal

01:05:56,090 --> 01:05:59,360
8 before and there were all these focus

01:05:57,680 --> 01:06:02,390
groups of people working on views and

01:05:59,360 --> 01:06:04,220
routing whatnot I did not know what to

01:06:02,390 --> 01:06:06,110
do until just started talking about the

01:06:04,220 --> 01:06:08,750
mentoring sprints and I thought well I

01:06:06,110 --> 01:06:12,040
know jack about Drupal 8 but I know

01:06:08,750 --> 01:06:12,040
