Description: 
	Why this session? - We want to set people up for success at the DrupalCon and in Drupal. This session helps newbies find their feet while getting a hint of the crazy energy we have in our community.

Audience participation! - Sing along to the "We are Drupal Chorus", here's the music and words.

After his Keynote address at DrupalCon Portland, Dries was asked, "Who is your favorite Drupal event speaker?" (1:24:00 onwards in the video here).

Dries said, "Actually, I love the session before my keynote by Robert Douglass and jam. It's just hilarious. It's not a very technical session, but it is really, really awesome. I mean, I was watching it and I was laughing all the time."

Come and get solid practical advice about Drupal, DrupalCon, and how to thrive as a member of the Drupal Community, all through music, storytelling, awful jokes, and a bevy of special guests -- including both Robert Douglass *and* Fake-Robert-Douglass this time around!

The best way to make sure you're awake and in the spirit in time for the keynote session (the "Driesnote") that follows is to set your alarm early, drag yourself to the main hall and join us for some early morning infotainment!

The same duo that brought you The Sound of Music set to Drupal at DrupalCon Chicago, A Drupal Carol at DrupalCon London, the iPad Orchestra at DrupalCon Denver, the ABCs of DrupalCon, featuring yodelling for geeks, men and women in dirndls, leather shorts, and (alcohol free) beer on stage in Munich, and the Drupal Gameshow Extravaganza in Portland are back to thrill and amaze!

"Rob and jam put their special twist on the meaning of DrupalCon. It's been a fun-filled -- and useful -- surprise every time. If you only get up early once during DrupalCon, this is the morning to do it. And hey, at least you'll get better seats for my keynote right after." - Dries
