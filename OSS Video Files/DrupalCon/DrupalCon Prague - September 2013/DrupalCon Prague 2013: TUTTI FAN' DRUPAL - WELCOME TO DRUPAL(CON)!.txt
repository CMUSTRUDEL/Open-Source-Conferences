Title: DrupalCon Prague 2013: TUTTI FAN' DRUPAL - WELCOME TO DRUPAL(CON)!
Publication date: 2013-09-24
Playlist: DrupalCon Prague - September 2013
Description: 
	Why this session? - We want to set people up for success at the DrupalCon and in Drupal. This session helps newbies find their feet while getting a hint of the crazy energy we have in our community.

Audience participation! - Sing along to the "We are Drupal Chorus", here's the music and words.

After his Keynote address at DrupalCon Portland, Dries was asked, "Who is your favorite Drupal event speaker?" (1:24:00 onwards in the video here).

Dries said, "Actually, I love the session before my keynote by Robert Douglass and jam. It's just hilarious. It's not a very technical session, but it is really, really awesome. I mean, I was watching it and I was laughing all the time."

Come and get solid practical advice about Drupal, DrupalCon, and how to thrive as a member of the Drupal Community, all through music, storytelling, awful jokes, and a bevy of special guests -- including both Robert Douglass *and* Fake-Robert-Douglass this time around!

The best way to make sure you're awake and in the spirit in time for the keynote session (the "Driesnote") that follows is to set your alarm early, drag yourself to the main hall and join us for some early morning infotainment!

The same duo that brought you The Sound of Music set to Drupal at DrupalCon Chicago, A Drupal Carol at DrupalCon London, the iPad Orchestra at DrupalCon Denver, the ABCs of DrupalCon, featuring yodelling for geeks, men and women in dirndls, leather shorts, and (alcohol free) beer on stage in Munich, and the Drupal Gameshow Extravaganza in Portland are back to thrill and amaze!

"Rob and jam put their special twist on the meaning of DrupalCon. It's been a fun-filled -- and useful -- surprise every time. If you only get up early once during DrupalCon, this is the morning to do it. And hey, at least you'll get better seats for my keynote right after." - Dries

00:12:34,689 --> 00:12:41,730
because faded quickly I am such a new

00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:57,670
some PHP some pH or a doctor that thing

00:12:50,730 --> 00:13:02,680
I am sure sweep an attack real good

00:12:57,670 --> 00:13:07,290
dude can I get mine

00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:10,060
with an open source things worse thing

00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:12,120
has it a day

00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:12,120
I

00:13:18,119 --> 00:13:21,629
anytime will

00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:41,000
so in the emotional journey of our opera

00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:45,230
storyline you know our new best got a

00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:46,610
gig great and now you know he's trying

00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:49,610
to figure out how to do it and he's not

00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:51,320
sure so we're coming to rock bottom are

00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:53,390
coming to the pit out of which our main

00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:57,970
character always has to climb out in

00:13:53,390 --> 00:14:01,880
these stories so we all know that

00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:05,050
getting into an open source project can

00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:08,360
be tricky some projects have famously

00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:12,350
stringent cultures you know or they're

00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:20,440
kind of grumpy as you a you know as a as

00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:20,440

00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:38,090
day Angie got selected to do Summer of

00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:41,960

00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:48,340
of growing up and getting advice from

00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:51,850
from this man this is a very American

00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:55,179
phenomena but in the United States this

00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:56,679
is this is a man he's passed away his

00:19:55,179 --> 00:19:58,600
name was Fred Rogers and he did a

00:19:56,679 --> 00:20:02,440
television show called mister rogers

00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:07,210
neighborhood and it was simply the

00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:08,530
wholesome missed you know most you know

00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:12,160
innocent and naive in the best possible

00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:13,960
way a television show where he just

00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:15,910
basically taught kids how to be a good

00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:17,590
person and how to be interested in you

00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:19,929
know the good things the simple things

00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:22,480
in life and he's a he's actually a real

00:20:19,929 --> 00:20:25,960
hero to a lot of people and he said one

00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:27,669
thing that I find inspiring and has a

00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:30,400
lot to do with my journey into the

00:20:27,669 --> 00:20:32,740
Drupal community he said when I was a

00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:35,610
boy and I would see scary things on the

00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:38,620
mailing lists my mother would say to me

00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:40,360
look for the helpers look for the

00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:43,419

are helping okay now this is this

00:20:43,419 --> 00:20:49,299

00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:19,580
you are asking why isn't Robert here ah

00:25:20,929 --> 00:25:28,140
how now we've noticed yet so who's heard

00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:31,470
of the open Goldberg Variations and the

00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:37,020
open well-tempered clavier Robert is

00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:40,559
doing an amazing um project with his

00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:45,419
wife who's a wonderful pianist and they

00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:47,280
are combining classical music with open

00:25:45,419 --> 00:25:49,110
source in a really really innovative and

00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:53,929
exciting way and they're in the middle

00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:56,159
of their second Kickstarter project and

00:25:53,929 --> 00:25:58,169
so it's from Bach you know with the

00:25:56,159 --> 00:26:01,890
copyright symbol to Bach without it and

00:25:58,169 --> 00:26:03,419
as of yesterday they were two days into

00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:06,120
their campaign and just about halfway

00:26:03,419 --> 00:26:07,500
there which is pretty astonishing and

00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:09,200
what they're doing is really cool

00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:11,760
they're making a studio quality

00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:15,110
recording of the first book of the

00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:17,700
well-tempered clavier which is 48

00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:21,270
exquisite pieces of music they're

00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:23,130
releasing that entire recording into the

00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:25,260
public domain completely free of any

00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:28,799
kind of copyright producing a physical

00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:31,080
CD producing a newly academically

00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:33,870
annotated open source non copyrighted

00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:35,610
version of the score now this is where

00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:38,429
things get crazy if you're not so much

00:26:35,610 --> 00:26:41,039
in the music world until the open

00:26:38,429 --> 00:26:45,320
Goldberg project there was no public

00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:48,210
domain academically you know accurate

00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:49,890
annotated version of box open Goldberg

00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:52,289
Variations for a piece of music that's

00:26:49,890 --> 00:26:54,630
you know what to 300 years old people

00:26:52,289 --> 00:26:56,610
can hold on to copyright that long so

00:26:54,630 --> 00:27:01,380
Robert in cooperation with his wife and

00:26:56,610 --> 00:27:04,950
musescore produced a new score released

00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:07,200
it in music XML and as a really cool

00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:09,090
playable file in the music or software

00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:10,770
and they're doing the same thing with

00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:13,140
the open well-tempered clavier it's a

00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:16,140
really worthwhile open source innovative

00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:18,360
interesting project and Roberts wife

00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:40,510
these sessions without Robert and

00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:42,070

00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:24,900
memory altered forms to entities or

00:28:22,170 --> 00:28:26,640

wonder crowd I wandering day in and out

00:29:26,330 --> 00:29:29,590
want to play this all about

00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:40,679
a website need some modules to get you

00:29:39,179 --> 00:29:42,090
lots of visit towards a task that brush

00:29:40,679 --> 00:29:43,559
makes trivial but make sure you have

00:29:42,090 --> 00:29:45,480
some of force and theming as a simple

00:29:43,559 --> 00:29:46,799
test with CSS and JavaScript that Eaton

00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:49,519

00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:49,519
construction kit

00:29:55,950 --> 00:30:02,410

to you at half price because I can tell

00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:16,300
you're rather nice a warning stems from

00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:20,380
ancient lore that junior devs should not

00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:26,460

00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:26,460
