Title: DrupalCon Prague 2013: ALTERNATIVE TO COMMERCIAL WEB-ANALYTICS TOOLS, A COOKIE STORY
Publication date: 2013-09-26
Playlist: DrupalCon Prague - September 2013
Description: 
	Talk aimed at the current state of EU cookie/privacy laws and how to utilize open source software to comply with that.
As a lot of things on the web, techniques that were once invented with a pretty clear scope (or seemingly so) usually dont take long to find multiple use cases.

In case of cookies, the nicest form of this is persisting session states between HTTP requests, the nastier form is the mechanism with which a lot of sites knowingly hand over visitor-loggint to third parties (with really nice tools!).

In both US and EU legislation has passed to at least increase the visibility of cookie usage and raise awareness.

Nowadays, a law-abiding webcitizen with a website warns his/her users about this, but this is cumbersome and annoying, because, why would you want to bother your visitors with the fact that you are giving away there information, when cleaner alternatives exist?

Piwik is such a tool, if offers a very usefull opensource alternative to the well-known commercial analytics tools and integrates very well with the leading open-source CMS'es.
This session will focus on some of the legal aspects on cookie usage, but mostly on how to integrate Piwik with your (Drupal) site and get the most out of it.

all right it's a I think about time to

00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:13,469
start so I hereby welcome you to my

00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:16,049
session lost dem laws and statistics a

00:00:13,469 --> 00:00:19,580
tale of cookies so more people are

00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:23,250
coming in everybody is more than welcome

00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:27,359
I hope everybody is having a nice

00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:28,890
conference I know I am so hope that's a

00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:31,619
positive thing helped a lot of

00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:39,899
interesting sessions you have witnessed

00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:42,540
and I hope to provide one to cookie

00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:44,520
story Who am I I'm not going to bore you

00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:46,200
too long with that but I think there

00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:50,010
should always be a classical car in any

00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:52,649
presentation especially my car so I have

00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:54,329
my own Rupa job I run project management

00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:57,059
I do event management I do basically

00:00:54,329 --> 00:01:01,230
everything I can find a client crazy

00:00:57,059 --> 00:01:07,830
enough to pay me for I've been doing

00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:10,920
drupal sins about 4.3 4.4 ish and after

00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:14,700
Drupal 7 released I decided simply to

00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:16,650
drop basically all other CMS source EMFs

00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:19,229
I was working with which were at the

00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:24,140
time mainly joomla wordpress hippo and

00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:24,140
drupal and focus on drupal entirely

00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:30,420
actually the biggest thing for me drupal

00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:34,140
consists of is not only code it's the

00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:36,689
community it's the fact that here and in

00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:38,729
other events in the netherlands some of

00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:42,420
which i helped organize where hundreds

00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:45,090
of enthusiasts all sharing knowledge not

00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:47,220
in a competitive sense of business way

00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:49,110
but in an absolute competitive sense of

00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:51,600
intelligence and code quality and

00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:54,659
feature wise and that's what's Drupal

00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:57,149
for me it's a fantastic ecosystem so

00:01:54,659 --> 00:02:02,189
that's why I decided to spend my time on

00:01:57,149 --> 00:02:06,229
that and then something happened we had

00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:10,349
a cookie issue or better we had a

00:02:06,229 --> 00:02:12,720
telecommunications law issue this

00:02:10,349 --> 00:02:13,710
presentation mainly consists of two

00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,870
parts I'm

00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:18,810
going to go into a bit of the

00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:22,320
legislation or side of telecommunication

00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:24,390
law which is privacy related and then

00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:26,370
I'm going to do the demo and that is

00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:31,520
absolutely on purpose keep the best for

00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:33,590
that so people don't run away I hope but

00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:36,780
telecommunication law is a European

00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:39,030
issue privacy related legislation is

00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:41,580
European issue which got translated into

00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:44,700
dutch legislation and this presentation

00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:46,920
is based on the dutch implementation of

00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:47,940
it that's not only because i'm dutch but

00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:51,260
i also think that the dutch

00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:54,240
implementation is a remarkable

00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:56,760
achievement in stupidity actually

00:02:54,240 --> 00:03:01,410
because it completely focused on the

00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:03,450
wrong issue as far as I'm concerned in

00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:07,650
the Dutch law and also a new European

00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:11,550
law distinction of information is made

00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:14,550
which boils down to a distinction of two

00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:16,950
types of cookies it's functionally

00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:19,380
necessary cookies like session cookies

00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:23,150
shopping carts things you actually need

00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:27,870
to make your site work and analytics

00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:30,660
cookies those are in the view of the

00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:33,750
ball maker optional and our privacy

00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:36,060
invasive by nature the assumption is

00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:38,370
that analytics cookies they contain

00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:40,770
identifiable information or at least

00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:45,480
some means of identifying a profile

00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:47,010
which could be constructed to resemble a

00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:49,350
certain individual and why is that

00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:54,210
profile interesting well everybody knows

00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:56,160
in e-commerce the best thing to know is

00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:59,640
simply who is your customer what has he

00:03:56,160 --> 00:04:03,300
bought in the past and therefore we can

00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:05,490
offer it more the assumption which is

00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:07,890
made under Dutch law is that analytics

00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:09,780
cookies always contain personally

00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:12,120
identifiable information until the

00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:14,220
webmaster or the owner can prove

00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:16,890
otherwise well which of course nobody's

00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:19,580
going to do so that's what I met with

00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:23,280
pretty much brain that implementation

00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:24,750
then we have functional cookies and

00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,850
their legal as long as the user is

00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:27,300
informed about them so cooking control

00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:32,220
something

00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:34,580
like that any cookie resembling personal

00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:39,120
information even if its analytics or

00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:47,180
functional should be explicitly accepted

00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:50,069
by users and this is something very hard

00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:53,280
wired in the Dutch legislation on this

00:04:50,069 --> 00:04:55,319
issue now this is of course very

00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:58,050
interesting because most systems utilize

00:04:55,319 --> 00:05:00,000
only one cookie to offer a lot of

00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:02,069
functionality actually it's pretty bad

00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,849
practice to like force a lot of cookies

00:05:02,069 --> 00:05:09,120
on users so this ends up an interesting

00:05:05,849 --> 00:05:12,770
mess so it's it's it's a nuisance it

00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:15,659
became pretty difficult to separate

00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:18,629
dysfunctionality because in an

00:05:15,659 --> 00:05:22,530
e-commerce site you also do analytics of

00:05:18,629 --> 00:05:25,620
your client behavior in a normal web

00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:27,780
site you also build up profiles of

00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:29,690
interesting users like targeted groups

00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:31,979
and stuff how does that relate to

00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:35,069
personally identifiable information and

00:05:31,979 --> 00:05:37,349
is that always a problem is or is it

00:05:35,069 --> 00:05:42,150
only a problem if a commercial interest

00:05:37,349 --> 00:05:43,680
is actually there in the privacy

00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:49,169
information a lot of sites actually

00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:51,529
offer content to forum profiles of the

00:05:49,169 --> 00:05:53,909
users physics and the content and which

00:05:51,529 --> 00:05:55,380
their business model is based on the

00:05:53,909 --> 00:05:58,789
fact that they can then sell the

00:05:55,380 --> 00:06:02,310
profiles so is ecommerce always a direct

00:05:58,789 --> 00:06:05,069
thing or not well Dutch public

00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:06,900
television which is one of those content

00:06:05,069 --> 00:06:09,419
providers who provides mainly knowledge

00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:11,969
has no commercial interest or whatsoever

00:06:09,419 --> 00:06:13,500
it's a public broadcasting service they

00:06:11,969 --> 00:06:15,779
decided what we're going to play it safe

00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:18,449
we're gonna play put a cookie wall in

00:06:15,779 --> 00:06:20,279
front of our website but that's a

00:06:18,449 --> 00:06:23,159
problem because Dutch public

00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:25,259
broadcasting like the BBC or any other

00:06:23,159 --> 00:06:27,479
ard yours at the eff something like that

00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:28,979
they have a public service to offer to

00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:32,069
have to provide public information

00:06:28,979 --> 00:06:34,949
without any constraints but now there

00:06:32,069 --> 00:06:37,500
was also legislation that demanded of

00:06:34,949 --> 00:06:39,120
them to provide information about the

00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,830
audience they were reaching with their

00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,470
communication because that actually

00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:47,040
gave them a reason of existence they had

00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:49,200
to measure that audience okay dare you

00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:52,800
use cookies one side all right that

00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:56,430
became a total mess they put down a

00:06:52,800 --> 00:07:00,360
cookie ball and visits up outside they

00:06:56,430 --> 00:07:01,890
dumped they everybody simply went to the

00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:07,590
commercial sites which simply ignored

00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:09,630
the law mostly website owners in Dutch

00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:12,690
in implementation of the law until

00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:15,330
recently we're also responsible for all

00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:18,060
cookies by the side which were set by

00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:21,660
any site visit on one side anyway so

00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:24,420
they would also be responsible for data

00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:26,190
leaks in like LinkedIn when they lose a

00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:28,970
couple of million passwords which

00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:33,090
happens every couple of months it seems

00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:34,740
facebook also gets hacked website owners

00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:37,730
themselves under that law are

00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:42,450
responsible or could be held accountable

00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:44,370
so this is really an incentive for Dutch

00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:46,710
shop owners and website owners to start

00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:50,730
thinking about what am I actually doing

00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:53,010
through my website what is what is it I

00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:56,220
offer in third-party means for instance

00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:59,100
it's this facebook like button only some

00:07:56,220 --> 00:08:05,430
sympathetic vote or is it potentially a

00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:07,650
legal minefield so any site owner has to

00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:10,890
pay privacy or cookie statement stating

00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:13,260
what they do with their information so

00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:14,850
that's annoying and then can the

00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:16,650
penalties of course because you cannot

00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:19,170
have legislation without any kind of

00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:23,090
enforcement at first enforcement was

00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:27,540
zilch naming shaming something like that

00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:32,040
but actually data loss under European

00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:33,450
law is pretty much being demanded that

00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:36,150
these incidents are being made public

00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:38,100
but for the Dutch implementation this

00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:39,420
would also mean that if you would have a

00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:41,250
LinkedIn button on your website or

00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:43,680
something like that and LinkedIn would

00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:45,570
leak any information you as the website

00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:49,140
owner the visitor had visited should

00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:53,160
also inform the client like I said

00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:54,420
that's legislation it's a mess but it

00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:56,700
gets simpler thank God

00:08:54,420 --> 00:09:02,970
get into that a bit later but it also

00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:08,240
gets a severely penalized in future in

00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:14,269
European Union reading the minister of

00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:16,410
of this particular area she has

00:09:14,269 --> 00:09:18,930
suggested in the current proposal a

00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:20,670
maximum of 1 million euros or two

00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:26,399
percent of the yearly turnover of a

00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:28,290
company as a penalty on data loss

00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:31,949
related incidents and that's quite a lot

00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:34,440
I mean websites web shops don't they may

00:09:31,949 --> 00:09:36,389
have pretty big turnovers but the

00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:39,839
margins on that turnover are pretty

00:09:36,389 --> 00:09:42,690
small so some hit on that particular

00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:45,269
margin it hits hard so that this

00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:49,889
actually is pretty steep a penalty I

00:09:45,269 --> 00:09:52,019
think well I'm asking how about

00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:53,880
usability penalties because all these

00:09:52,019 --> 00:09:57,449
cookie balls and stuff like that are

00:09:53,880 --> 00:10:00,329
also chasing users away that's a

00:09:57,449 --> 00:10:02,430
different approach but the biggest

00:10:00,329 --> 00:10:03,750
problem right now in the EU is the fact

00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:06,560
that all different countries have

00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:09,089
different implementations on this field

00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:11,160
Noel actually it became even more

00:10:09,089 --> 00:10:14,519
confusing in the Netherlands bear with

00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:19,470
me but now it gets a little clearer

00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:22,680
because right now there are being made

00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:24,110
to pretty big changes in the

00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:28,290
interpretation of the law that I

00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:31,769
referred to earlier actually information

00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:33,930
domains are being split in two domains

00:10:31,769 --> 00:10:37,230
it's going to be first party and third

00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:39,360
party domains so anything you use and

00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:42,899
you store yourself for your own in-house

00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:45,839
purposes you can pretty much do without

00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:47,640
that much trouble of course you're still

00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:49,800
have to comply if you have a data loss

00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:51,660
you have to publish it but if you keep

00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:53,790
it in the house you don't have to bother

00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:56,399
your user with it too much which is a

00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:58,350
very good thing I think because nobody

00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:01,139
likes having to go through kooky walls

00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:04,110
to get to the web shop to order that new

00:11:01,139 --> 00:11:06,839
fantastic gadget and you have

00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:08,339
third-party cookies or third-party

00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:10,050
information

00:11:08,339 --> 00:11:14,160
domain which basically is everything

00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:17,819
else the review phase for this law has

00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:19,470
ended at first of July and it has still

00:11:17,819 --> 00:11:21,329
to be made into effect but this is

00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:24,180
pretty much the way it looked like it's

00:11:21,329 --> 00:11:25,889
going right now in the EU as well so and

00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:27,480
actually I think this makes sense I mean

00:11:25,889 --> 00:11:29,610
everything you can control yourself

00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:32,399
anything you can host on your own

00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:38,939
servers or at least keep in your own

00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:40,379
protective zone well that is of a

00:11:38,939 --> 00:11:42,779
completely different quality than

00:11:40,379 --> 00:11:47,430
something that's aggravating around the

00:11:42,779 --> 00:11:49,170
web of course you could ask how far you

00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:50,579
should go by interpreting this because

00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:55,499
if you lost your website on like say

00:11:50,579 --> 00:11:57,899
Amazon or as your then well how much is

00:11:55,499 --> 00:12:00,029
that first party adding up those are

00:11:57,899 --> 00:12:03,240
questions still have to be answered the

00:12:00,029 --> 00:12:05,430
bigger picture about this and is simply

00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:08,069
that the European Union has started to

00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:10,829
take an interest in the digital identity

00:12:08,069 --> 00:12:13,759
of its citizens and has very much taken

00:12:10,829 --> 00:12:16,920
an interest in to the safety and the

00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:20,509
control their citizens have over this

00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:23,639
digital identities and the discussion

00:12:20,509 --> 00:12:26,490
it's made its labeled the right to be

00:12:23,639 --> 00:12:29,569
forgotten I like that from a

00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:32,040
philosophical standpoint but it is

00:12:29,569 --> 00:12:34,670
mostly about autonomic control of

00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:37,920
personal information a user should have

00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:41,879
control over who uses their own

00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:45,600
information regulation should be based

00:12:41,879 --> 00:12:49,160
not only in the EU area but mainly to

00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:53,309
businesses who do work in the EU area so

00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:57,059
if a European citizen does business with

00:12:53,309 --> 00:12:59,610
an American company European laws should

00:12:57,059 --> 00:13:04,949
apply this is something that is not yet

00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:07,800
this firm Lee in effect because well the

00:13:04,949 --> 00:13:11,699
u.s. opposes it and let's say that China

00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:15,089
mainly ignores it but still it's it's a

00:13:11,699 --> 00:13:18,720
step in the right direction users have

00:13:15,089 --> 00:13:21,449
to provide actually an tangible consent

00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,150
before their information has to be used

00:13:21,449 --> 00:13:23,350
and I think this

00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:26,680
is a really good thing because i think

00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:28,980
that the average user has the awareness

00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:32,440
of a cucumber when it comes to like

00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:34,330
their own private data and simply isn't

00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:36,820
interested that's that is a problem

00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:39,340
which can only be solved by educating

00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:41,320
people and well people only want to be

00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:42,630
educated if they are annoyed by the fact

00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:46,720
that they have to do something or

00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:49,480
scratch an itch or something the

00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:52,980
regulation thank God will now apply for

00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:55,390
the entire EU so you don't get any more

00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:57,100
fantastic magical implementations of the

00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:59,920
law like we had in a Netherlands thank

00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:01,870
God because somehow I don't think the

00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:06,730
internet stops at the Dutch border it's

00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:08,050
just my impression and there are some

00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:10,120
other things like it should be possible

00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:12,370
to take all of your personal information

00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:18,120
when you switch content or service

00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:20,710
providers the whole idea is simply that

00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:24,120
keeping information inside the EU is a

00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:27,880
good thing both privacy wise both

00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:30,610
economic wise because yeah elsewhere

00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:34,090
simply giving it away and the EU is

00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:37,180
still the largest economic area on this

00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:40,690
particular planet would be nice if we do

00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:45,040
something with it oh well so so what all

00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:48,310
this lawful stuff is fantastic I'm hope

00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:50,650
you are happy that you now have I hope

00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:55,110
not have a headache about all this legal

00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:57,340
stuff but so i use google analytics

00:14:55,110 --> 00:15:01,510
actually who does use google analytics

00:14:57,340 --> 00:15:04,600
here i think yeah alright that's that's

00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:07,620
a lot who don't actually its last time I

00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:10,870
gave this talk about like the whole room

00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:12,840
yeah it's a great too and actually who

00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:15,370
of you is actually interested in

00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:17,560
compliance to law in this point who has

00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:19,060
made it a point researching that before

00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:23,200
they started using Google analytic I see

00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:25,060
one and two henchmen ok cool wow that's

00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:27,220
nice and you don't all work for

00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:29,250
government entities or NGOs or stuff

00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:34,860
like that you also work for commercial

00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:37,470
cool because actually I know that

00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:39,690
there wasn't much of a consideration at

00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:42,810
first for me it was like a good tool

00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:46,310
let's use it and my clients asked for it

00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:50,580
and then this whole debate started out

00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:53,100
well you could do one thing screwed up

00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:54,960
still use google analytics don't mention

00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:58,320
it to your users stuff like that I

00:15:54,960 --> 00:16:00,210
actually have customers who tell me not

00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:02,310
to implement stuff like cookie control

00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:04,560
because they don't think it's important

00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:06,780
yeah what do you do with that do you

00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:08,010
actually tell your customer like oh I'm

00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:11,460
not going to build your site because

00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:15,150
then you will be breaking the law or

00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:22,730
well no I started researching other

00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:25,380
avenues and that's basically also became

00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:29,160
actual and current again since Google a

00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:34,860
couple of days ago decided to change its

00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:36,870
a search pattern again in a way now that

00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:39,750
all search queries are being done over

00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:41,250
HTTPS over SSL which basically means

00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:43,980
that you don't get your keywords anymore

00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:47,490
well that caused a bit of a panic in SEO

00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:48,990
land as you probably can imagine and and

00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:51,720
of course from the google standpoint

00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:54,480
yeah well that's business they can do

00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:57,180
that I don't have an opinion that much

00:16:54,480 --> 00:17:00,480
on that but it's annoying because you

00:16:57,180 --> 00:17:03,330
somehow cannot utilize the tools you had

00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:07,650
because some third-party entity decided

00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:09,480
to change something now being that some

00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:11,430
third party being Google there is

00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:14,730
something you probably cannot work

00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:17,250
around but alright it's still annoying

00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:20,880
and what do you do if your user actually

00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:23,910
does press no because most of the sites

00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:27,300
i come across and also i do a lot of

00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:29,760
audits they have like cookie banners

00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:31,620
cookie control stuff like that but they

00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,940
don't have do not track or opt out or

00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:35,100
something like that but what do you do

00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:39,210
with the user who actually doesn't want

00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:40,650
to have its information store because

00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:45,390
pretty soon it's going to be legislation

00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:47,730
to that this might be in foreign force

00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:48,659
as a default setting on clients there's

00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:52,590
actually talk

00:17:48,659 --> 00:17:54,419
about love enabling laws to like enable

00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:56,609
do not track by default which is

00:17:54,419 --> 00:17:59,909
interesting but also from a business

00:17:56,609 --> 00:18:02,549
point of view if you use a commercial

00:17:59,909 --> 00:18:04,710
platform whether it be analytics or

00:18:02,549 --> 00:18:08,369
giraffe or anything at all what is your

00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:10,940
exit strategy what if you at one time 12

00:18:08,369 --> 00:18:14,009
simply stop using it use something else

00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:16,859
google is pretty doable but there are

00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:18,809
also tools which are basically some kind

00:18:16,859 --> 00:18:20,700
of file locker you will never get your

00:18:18,809 --> 00:18:23,519
information out I actually have clients

00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:24,929
who used some services which basically

00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:27,710
meant they had to make print screens of

00:18:24,929 --> 00:18:32,879
although I'll report there went the data

00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:36,409
and that that is mostly the argument the

00:18:32,879 --> 00:18:39,210
I have them clients these days is like

00:18:36,409 --> 00:18:40,590
what if google changes something what if

00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:42,960
you have a question that you cannot

00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:45,539
fulfill with standard analytic software

00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:47,009
and what if you want to leave that's

00:18:45,539 --> 00:18:50,399
offered it's not that much focused on

00:18:47,009 --> 00:18:52,919
law it's focused on functionality all

00:18:50,399 --> 00:18:55,200
right and then peewit comes in so we

00:18:52,919 --> 00:18:57,119
have now entered the second part of this

00:18:55,200 --> 00:19:01,169
story I usually now hear a sigh of

00:18:57,119 --> 00:19:02,669
relief what's bewick Vivek is the

00:19:01,169 --> 00:19:05,429
example I'm going to focus on today I'm

00:19:02,669 --> 00:19:08,070
going to show or talk about a couple of

00:19:05,429 --> 00:19:13,499
alternatives there are also researched

00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:16,679
but I found that Buick is basically d

00:19:13,499 --> 00:19:20,639
tool I can go to sit down at a client

00:19:16,679 --> 00:19:22,169
demo it and the whole question of Google

00:19:20,639 --> 00:19:25,259
Analytics simply goes off the table

00:19:22,169 --> 00:19:27,479
because it's actually that good I don't

00:19:25,259 --> 00:19:30,330
know if it interests you that much but

00:19:27,479 --> 00:19:32,369
once upon a time there was phb my visits

00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:34,710
which is now ancient and a dead project

00:19:32,369 --> 00:19:38,869
because it's not big it's actually

00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:42,840
pretty modern it's it uses modern PHP

00:19:38,869 --> 00:19:44,309
platform stuff it's usable on shared

00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:49,039
hosting environments which is a good

00:19:44,309 --> 00:19:52,349
thing it integrates well with all major

00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:55,440
CMS's I even done implementations with

00:19:52,349 --> 00:19:58,849
SharePoint on a couple of occasions

00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:01,470
which works also beautifully in

00:19:58,849 --> 00:20:02,490
completely Oh contraire to in built in

00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:06,030
SharePoint

00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:07,920
statistics which suck it's pretty

00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:09,960
user-friendly I don't know if any of you

00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:13,710
have ever tried stuff like aw stats but

00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:16,980
it's horrible it's don't ever put that

00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:19,380
into user or give them a valium or

00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:21,720
something most importantly it stores

00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:23,580
your data locally cookies are optional

00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:25,440
and it's a big project it's being used

00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:27,059
by a lot of website according to the

00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:31,230
pburg websites is over half a million

00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:34,050
websites who use p wig today so that's

00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:36,030
pretty nice are there alternatives yep

00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:39,179
there are it wouldn't be open source if

00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:41,160
they weren't like five alternatives sure

00:20:39,179 --> 00:20:43,110
we have open web analytics and that's a

00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:46,130
pretty on par functional wise it's

00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:48,990
pretty much on par with with PB acuity

00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:51,179
it's a little older and the drupal

00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:54,540
module is not that polished so that's

00:20:51,179 --> 00:20:56,370
why i skipped on that yep crawl track

00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:58,410
crawl track is a really interesting

00:20:56,370 --> 00:21:00,900
thing because it claims to not only do

00:20:58,410 --> 00:21:04,340
statistics but also block hack attempt I

00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:07,260
don't know but I don't need magic potion

00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:09,420
in my website and I really don't like my

00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:11,309
statistics platform to do security stuff

00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:14,900
I use mu security for that well then we

00:21:11,309 --> 00:21:18,000
have aw stats webalizer analog wel

00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:20,280
they're all pero SI base there static

00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,720
log parsers and they look something like

00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:24,809
something that you would control the

00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:26,460
Space Shuttle with it's horrible so

00:21:24,809 --> 00:21:28,950
those are the alternatives i have

00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:30,809
researched if any of you have any other

00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:32,100
experience that be very interested to

00:21:30,809 --> 00:21:34,830
know because it's always good to have

00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:38,850
options but i'm going to focus on bewick

00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:41,610
so what does it do then well just about

00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:44,309
anything a normal statistics program do

00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:45,960
but then if you want with cookies so

00:21:44,309 --> 00:21:51,110
that you can actually track individual

00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:53,490
users or at least computers sessions

00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:56,730
trouble nowadays especially with the IP

00:21:53,490 --> 00:22:01,610
for two ip6 migrations you start to see

00:21:56,730 --> 00:22:05,010
a lot of more adverse bullying ip-based

00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:08,520
stats software they really don't give

00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:09,690
any meaningful information if you look

00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:11,809
in the Netherlands for instance you have

00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:14,520
mobile telephone providers who offer

00:22:11,809 --> 00:22:16,110
proxy services for their mobile internet

00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:17,850
connection which basically means

00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:21,000
like a million people connect over for

00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:24,900
ipv4 addresses okay there goes your

00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:27,510
information so people does can use

00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:31,020
cookies to do that aight aight can do

00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:33,559
click paths entry exit pages all the

00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:38,010
stuff that you actually can do with

00:22:33,559 --> 00:22:40,920
Google Analytics but there's more you

00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:43,880
can also leave extra information in

00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:48,870
refers you can use annotations you can

00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:51,690
do ecommerce implementations also it's

00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:54,530
it integrates very nice with duple

00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:57,419
commerce for like abandoned cart

00:22:54,530 --> 00:22:59,640
detection you can get automated email

00:22:57,419 --> 00:23:03,150
reports you can do campaign stuff like

00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:05,280
that it's a complete platform estee at

00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:07,500
all no it can also do something very

00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:09,990
nice which Google Analytics cannot do it

00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:13,260
can parse server logs you can actually

00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:15,330
use it as a background to and why is

00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:16,980
that cool well actually because if your

00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:20,940
user decides to press the dunno track

00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:22,140
button by law you are still allowed to

00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:24,809
power server logs and get information

00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:27,720
out of that so you can get a more much

00:23:24,809 --> 00:23:30,150
more complete picture of the actual site

00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:32,900
user there are also a lot of privacy

00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:38,549
related options anonymous IP addresses

00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:40,320
purging data and there's back twenty

00:23:38,549 --> 00:23:43,590
third party plugins you can do a lot

00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:45,630
with so check it out well Drupal

00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:49,049
integration wouldn't you know there's a

00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:51,480
module for that and what does that do

00:23:49,049 --> 00:23:54,120
well actually the same as the module for

00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:58,350
Google Analytics it stucks sticks some

00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:59,850
JavaScript into your theme to send the

00:23:58,350 --> 00:24:02,250
information to the public server nice

00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:05,750
thing is it can do this both in HTTP as

00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:12,140
well as SSL so that's pretty much

00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:14,910
privacy concerned well thought of it can

00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:16,230
offer reporting from the Drupal

00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:17,970
administration interface i'm going to

00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:20,490
show you that a bit later because that's

00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:23,370
really nice you can have actual reports

00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:27,360
live reports in your drupal content

00:24:23,370 --> 00:24:29,510
editing interface for your content

00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:32,480
editors

00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:35,940
and you can customize what but to track

00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:38,280
from within Drupal which is also nice so

00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:41,310
you can simply set up a pubic server

00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:43,800
somewhere in your firm have Madame

00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:45,390
connect to multiple Drupal sites and

00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:49,140
then from the Drupal sites configure

00:24:45,390 --> 00:24:52,520
what not and not to do you still however

00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:55,410
need something at least within the EU to

00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:58,620
make sure your cookie or at least your

00:24:55,410 --> 00:25:03,000
law compliant like cookie control but at

00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:05,190
least using P week and the Drupal pubic

00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:08,150
module it's bringing you one step closer

00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:11,700
to independence from a lot of nastiness

00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:15,000
how is it in an XSS sense I here because

00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:17,040
placing JavaScript on the page could be

00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:20,190
dangerous well it's not more dangerous

00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:22,500
than any other analytics tool in that

00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:27,390
matter and you are still responsible for

00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:29,490
your site's security level and but

00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:32,790
security website produts is a different

00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:35,520
workshop and I'll focus on pubic now

00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:39,420
what's offered out of box for Drupal it

00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:41,940
offers visits trends visit times entry

00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:44,580
exit pages refers community Commerce

00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:49,410
anything you can combine reports you can

00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:51,750
show them to your users so that's pretty

00:25:49,410 --> 00:25:55,590
nice but instead of talking about it a

00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:57,750
lot I'm gonna do a demo and I hope that

00:25:55,590 --> 00:26:00,570
the internet will not fill me but in

00:25:57,750 --> 00:26:08,340
case so that I did prepare a local host

00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:13,230
thing seems to be working all right this

00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:15,390
is demo pivot org and I strongly invite

00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:18,090
anyone to go there and simply have a

00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:21,300
look around click around best part about

00:26:18,090 --> 00:26:24,270
p week is the fact that it's so insanely

00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:28,200
easy to customize the interface and have

00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:30,660
that done by just about anyone in your

00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:34,860
organization they can set up their own

00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:39,360
filters date ranges stuff like that they

00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:42,450
can select for specific filters here not

00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:46,590
only dates they can add widgets to their

00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:49,620
dashboard a user in Pyrrhic can pretty

00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:51,510
much create his own experience and

00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:54,600
that's really nice that is something

00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:56,310
most other traditional open-source

00:26:54,600 --> 00:27:00,990
platforms really do not do it's like

00:26:56,310 --> 00:27:05,010
these are the reports stick to them you

00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:12,540
have visitor logs also a very nice

00:27:05,010 --> 00:27:15,120
graphs life visitor log you can see

00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:17,280
real-time who is doing what on which

00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:19,200
website which is also very nice usually

00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:22,440
in Google there is a delay of a couple

00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:26,550
of seconds minutes between these things

00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:30,840
it has device detection very nice in the

00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:33,450
age of responsive websites it also does

00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:36,960
location mapping and it does a

00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:38,880
best-effort on internet providers how

00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:42,510
that is relevant I don't know but it

00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:44,700
could be useful you can even detect

00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:46,680
browser settings to optimize your site

00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:48,660
for certain audience if you detect that

00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:50,640
your site is mainly being visited by

00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:53,040
only english-speaking people then it

00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:57,140
might not be the most interesting

00:27:53,040 --> 00:28:00,810
strategy to only put up a check website

00:27:57,140 --> 00:28:03,120
or dodge operating systems resolutions

00:28:00,810 --> 00:28:07,380
and it results is all really nice you

00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:11,040
don't get the craft of a dozen of

00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:14,550
identical browser strings which only

00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:16,920
differ one letter or something like you

00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:21,290
get with aw stats it simply clusters it

00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:24,330
very well also interesting visit times

00:28:21,290 --> 00:28:27,200
engagement lovely report see how how

00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:32,600
much time your users spend on a website

00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:40,100
this is either done by the cookies or by

00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:44,310
the IP translation you can look for X

00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:47,760
actions and three exit pages etc refers

00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:49,680
campaign's website social search engines

00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:51,240
and keywords well that is actually

00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:53,430
here's the thing i was mentioning

00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:55,440
earlier keyword not defined it's the

00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:56,320
thing that you will see a lot in SEO

00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:58,509
tools these

00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:02,169
is because Google simply decided not to

00:28:58,509 --> 00:29:04,450
provide them anymore that is a problem

00:29:02,169 --> 00:29:07,450
because that is actually information you

00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:13,139
would like to have but the question is

00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:16,990
at what cost this also has impact on the

00:29:13,139 --> 00:29:20,019
inbuilt search engine of Drupal or at

00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:22,840
least the Google version of the built-in

00:29:20,019 --> 00:29:24,610
search engine Baidu pardon all we do do

00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:27,279
you have users on websites who use

00:29:24,610 --> 00:29:28,929
Google to index their Drupal site and

00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:32,649
search their group aside do you have any

00:29:28,929 --> 00:29:35,139
or okay come across it sometime so if

00:29:32,649 --> 00:29:37,330
you if you have users like that then

00:29:35,139 --> 00:29:39,909
you've lost the ability to track the

00:29:37,330 --> 00:29:45,090
inside searches as well and that really

00:29:39,909 --> 00:29:47,740
sucks but that's actually showing how

00:29:45,090 --> 00:29:52,720
hardening and how fierce the competition

00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:55,600
in this market area is going goals very

00:29:52,720 --> 00:30:02,370
nice for both ecommerce and content

00:29:55,600 --> 00:30:05,889
steering so take a look on PP week and

00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:07,600
see what you can do with it you can also

00:30:05,889 --> 00:30:10,679
have and this is also a nice feature

00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:14,950
have users set up their own email

00:30:10,679 --> 00:30:20,190
reports I've just switched to my local

00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:20,190
host environment because of this

00:30:24,530 --> 00:30:30,480
you can also have which is added to

00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:35,250
other sites but let's look at the Drupal

00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:38,940
integration for a little bit it has two

00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:41,670
modules it has a module p web analytics

00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:46,770
which integrates the actual javascript

00:30:41,670 --> 00:30:50,420
with the drupal site and it has a module

00:30:46,770 --> 00:30:54,179
pubic reports which enables a

00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:58,230
administrator user to have a look at the

00:30:54,179 --> 00:31:01,620
content of the actual pubic reports how

00:30:58,230 --> 00:31:04,679
does it look well like this if you go to

00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:08,549
reports we now have new entry p back

00:31:04,679 --> 00:31:12,419
reports which shows just about anything

00:31:08,549 --> 00:31:16,980
i have just shown you just now but then

00:31:12,419 --> 00:31:21,299
directly in the tuple interface settings

00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:27,210
times etc configuration for this is also

00:31:21,299 --> 00:31:30,179
pretty straightforward tracking which

00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:31,950
means what most dispute instance do you

00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:34,860
have to provide the site ID which you

00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:38,580
get out of pea wig the installation you

00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:40,559
have to point the module to the actual

00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:45,330
pubic insulation that probably makes

00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:47,940
sense you can also track multi-site or

00:31:45,330 --> 00:31:50,790
multi sub domain implementation

00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:53,850
separately you can track pages you can

00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:55,740
exclude pages anything you want just

00:31:53,850 --> 00:32:00,110
think of it as block configuration or

00:31:55,740 --> 00:32:00,110
something like that context you can

00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:08,490
decide for which rolls tracking code

00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:10,919
must be enabled you can allow users to

00:32:08,490 --> 00:32:15,990
customize which they want to be correct

00:32:10,919 --> 00:32:18,330
or not links and downloads can also be

00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:20,070
tracks which is also nice if you're a

00:32:18,330 --> 00:32:23,160
content provider you would like to see

00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:25,470
what people are doing internal search

00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:29,690
can also be tracked but you have to

00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:32,760
switch it on by default it's off and

00:32:29,690 --> 00:32:35,680
here we go Universal web tracking opted

00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:37,900
out which actually is compliant with

00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:43,000
not tracking this is pretty unique for

00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:46,870
most open source tracking stuff by its

00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:49,420
titles you can add custom variables

00:32:46,870 --> 00:32:52,200
useful for campaigns and stuff like that

00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:55,630
and there is also what they call

00:32:52,200 --> 00:33:00,840
advanced settings and you can add also

00:32:55,630 --> 00:33:04,210
some JavaScript code if you want to have

00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:06,100
something else on to pburg you want to

00:33:04,210 --> 00:33:10,090
track that's also possible through the

00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:12,850
interface so you can basically configure

00:33:10,090 --> 00:33:16,570
it all there is no theming editing or

00:33:12,850 --> 00:33:18,880
anything needed to implement this and it

00:33:16,570 --> 00:33:20,580
outputs a nice cacheable piece of

00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:25,590
JavaScript so there is also no

00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:29,860
performance penalty this is the tracking

00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:32,500
reports that's pretty easy just pointed

00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:34,590
to the URL if you don't fill in anything

00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:37,180
it's using URL that's tracking it

00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:42,850
provide the authentication string of the

00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:44,410
user and you can restrict decides your

00:33:42,850 --> 00:33:46,720
users can track through this

00:33:44,410 --> 00:33:51,520
implementation that's pretty easy I

00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:55,060
think that's not harder than then Google

00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:58,450
Analytics and it works I mean I have

00:33:55,060 --> 00:34:04,600
here home I'm very creative I have a

00:33:58,450 --> 00:34:11,020
test page and if I look into my pea wig

00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:13,290
I can see that if I select the date of

00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:13,290
today

00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:29,200
that there have actually been visits and

00:34:20,109 --> 00:34:38,429
I can see what I have done well actually

00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:40,839
that is pretty much it so no not yet

00:34:38,429 --> 00:34:43,030
what if i want to start using p week i

00:34:40,839 --> 00:34:45,099
have already a lot of information stored

00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:48,099
in other systems like google analytics

00:34:45,099 --> 00:34:50,919
what to do now there are migration tools

00:34:48,099 --> 00:34:53,470
that is cool so you can actually take

00:34:50,919 --> 00:34:56,589
your a three from google put it into pea

00:34:53,470 --> 00:34:58,480
wig and synchronize it you can also do

00:34:56,589 --> 00:35:00,369
log file imports so you can also open

00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:04,030
pick up the apache logs from your past

00:35:00,369 --> 00:35:11,560
years or something import them to really

00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:12,580
nice and that was it any questions if

00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:13,810
you have questions please go to the

00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:15,820
microphones by the way because this

00:35:13,810 --> 00:35:17,520
session is recorded just like anything

00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:20,920
else and then your question comes back

00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:23,560
yeah yeah nice talk I'd never even

00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:25,720
actually come across p work is it

00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:28,300
something that's pretty easy to install

00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:29,920
I mean is there sort of like if there to

00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:31,900
get the dev guys kind of set it up

00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:36,609
because I take you say that one server

00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:41,400
somewhere and yeah yeah the installation

00:35:36,609 --> 00:35:41,400
is actually go to be weak dollar org and

00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:52,089
download a turbo which is mostly not

00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:55,990
surprising and of course not honor it's

00:35:52,089 --> 00:36:01,060
doing it's actually three steps download

00:35:55,990 --> 00:36:03,490
it install it and configure a MySQL

00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:05,820
database for it and then you can run it

00:36:03,490 --> 00:36:08,470
it's it the installation of pea wig is

00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:10,540
definitely not harder it's even simpler

00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:11,859
than installing Drupal so if one of your

00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:14,290
admins can install Drupal a can

00:36:11,859 --> 00:36:16,150
definitely installed pubic and the best

00:36:14,290 --> 00:36:19,450
part is you can set up one pubic server

00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:22,330
for a whole forest of websites so you

00:36:19,450 --> 00:36:25,270
only have to have one dedicated / leads

00:36:22,330 --> 00:36:26,080
into my next question so how intensive

00:36:25,270 --> 00:36:27,370
is it I mean

00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:29,110
what sort of server do you need so so if

00:36:27,370 --> 00:36:32,050
you've got a ten sites that are getting

00:36:29,110 --> 00:36:34,300
a lot of hits I presume that's going to

00:36:32,050 --> 00:36:35,830
be logging and that's the stuff going on

00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:39,070
yeah but pburg actually does a

00:36:35,830 --> 00:36:42,130
synchronous processing so the actual

00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:44,140
logging of the requests is done in a

00:36:42,130 --> 00:36:48,220
completely separate and very small it's

00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:51,220
like 10 lines of PHP code which simply

00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:53,410
dumps the log and let the interface and

00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:56,980
the user who request it do the rest so

00:36:53,410 --> 00:37:00,850
it's it's not it's definitely not very

00:36:56,980 --> 00:37:02,890
much of an overhead last question yeah

00:37:00,850 --> 00:37:04,870
so you're talking about drop-offs and

00:37:02,890 --> 00:37:06,010
like say a shopping cart figuring out

00:37:04,870 --> 00:37:08,080
when people are dropping off and that's

00:37:06,010 --> 00:37:11,470
a thing would you still need to I

00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:15,460
presume add like on click vents or some

00:37:11,470 --> 00:37:17,140
sort of specific tracking code to do

00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:22,920
that type of thing or is it something

00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:25,470
that kind of doesn't you can go to

00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:33,210
things like e-commerce and goals in

00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:33,210
settings let me check websites

00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:47,970
and you can simply enable ecommerce here

00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:50,610
and that will talk to drupal commerce

00:37:47,970 --> 00:37:53,550
because of the Drupal period module will

00:37:50,610 --> 00:37:55,400
translate commerce bold and if you had

00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:57,570
things like web forms for instance

00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:58,980
multi-step ones and you wanted to figure

00:37:57,570 --> 00:38:03,090
out if people are dropping off after

00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:07,850
couple of steps you can look with entry

00:38:03,090 --> 00:38:12,690
and exit pages pretty well and that's

00:38:07,850 --> 00:38:14,670
here entry exit pages you can see where

00:38:12,690 --> 00:38:17,510
somebody comes in and what their paths

00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:22,380
is and where they go out you can see

00:38:17,510 --> 00:38:26,400
also in engagement what the actual route

00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:28,890
is that users are doing here also in the

00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:33,180
visitor log you will see that this is my

00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:36,390
current user weight this is my current

00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:39,090
user and you see that this is already

00:38:36,390 --> 00:38:41,580
bundling the site request I made a

00:38:39,090 --> 00:38:43,200
couple of seconds ago into one session

00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:45,480
so it tried to make a session of it so

00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:47,130
you can analyze the sessions and see

00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:49,320
where users to above and this of course

00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:54,180
is also something you can automate so

00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:57,680
yes you can have reports to see where

00:38:54,180 --> 00:39:00,330
users stop being interested and drop out

00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:02,130
and I presume that then works with

00:39:00,330 --> 00:39:04,470
repeat visits and that's or thing I'm

00:39:02,130 --> 00:39:06,270
sorry I'm case because I presume that

00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:08,040
then works with repeat visits and when

00:39:06,270 --> 00:39:09,990
people come back to the side kind of

00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:12,720
picks up that they got me in there

00:39:09,990 --> 00:39:15,810
before and all that yeah at least a few

00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:17,760
sorry if you have cookies enabled then

00:39:15,810 --> 00:39:20,670
it will beautifully pick up the session

00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:28,530
again okay thank you right thanks

00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:32,580
anything else you cool yeah thanks

00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:35,370
we are actually running pivot and and

00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:37,170
then later we had to install google

00:39:35,370 --> 00:39:40,140
analytics as well because of marketing

00:39:37,170 --> 00:39:42,870
people wanted it to and their main

00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:45,890
argument was the pivot legs and

00:39:42,870 --> 00:39:50,700
integration of google adwords so yes we

00:39:45,890 --> 00:39:53,070
are you aware of anything that that

00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:54,600
pivot is capable of doing this I mean

00:39:53,070 --> 00:39:58,170
like to integrate in a way without words

00:39:54,600 --> 00:40:00,180
or something well it's pretty hard for

00:39:58,170 --> 00:40:01,710
just about anybody else than Google to

00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:05,130
integrate with Google AdWords really

00:40:01,710 --> 00:40:07,310
well which probably is one of the

00:40:05,130 --> 00:40:12,600
reasons why they're so damn successful

00:40:07,310 --> 00:40:14,460
in these cases this is not something

00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:17,130
that's off about by P wig because the

00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:18,810
actual information that is stored in the

00:40:17,130 --> 00:40:21,270
Google request is simply not being

00:40:18,810 --> 00:40:23,880
provided in any usable way by Google

00:40:21,270 --> 00:40:26,940
because it's all HTTPS nowadays so

00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:31,080
basically you're you're blocked but what

00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:36,180
you can do is add several variables

00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:39,660
custom variables to your campaigns so

00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:42,480
that you can track what is the actual

00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:44,580
traffic coming from a certain server and

00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:49,130
actually Edwards come from a different

00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:51,540
refer than regular Google search up

00:40:49,130 --> 00:40:53,970
search actions so you can differentiate

00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:56,280
with that but if you use AdWords yeah

00:40:53,970 --> 00:41:03,230
you basically have to use google tools

00:40:56,280 --> 00:41:07,200
to do it well but however once you're

00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:10,050
inside your own website especially due

00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:12,420
to the fact that people can also parse

00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:14,250
logs and do stuff that you can actually

00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:16,560
do without scripting or stuff like that

00:41:14,250 --> 00:41:20,220
you actually get a lot more information

00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:22,440
a lot more factual information about the

00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:25,260
behavior of people on your website and

00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:27,990
that's also valuable so I think it's two

00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:33,860
types of information each has its own

00:41:27,990 --> 00:41:36,810
merits any other questions right now

00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:38,900
nope well thank you very much for being

00:41:36,810 --> 00:41:38,900
here

00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:53,589
and if you do have questions and look me

00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:55,660
up there is a brief announcement from

00:41:53,589 --> 00:41:57,939
the organizers of the conference will

00:41:55,660 --> 00:42:06,969
which will be presented by this person

00:41:57,939 --> 00:42:08,439
here hi everyone I've just been asked to

00:42:06,969 --> 00:42:10,239
make an announcement which we're trying

00:42:08,439 --> 00:42:12,309
to feed out some information to people

00:42:10,239 --> 00:42:15,719
who are attending on the site builders

00:42:12,309 --> 00:42:20,619
track so just really out to you add
