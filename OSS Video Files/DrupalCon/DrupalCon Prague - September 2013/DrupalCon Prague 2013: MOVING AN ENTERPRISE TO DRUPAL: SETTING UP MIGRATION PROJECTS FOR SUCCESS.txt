Title: DrupalCon Prague 2013: MOVING AN ENTERPRISE TO DRUPAL: SETTING UP MIGRATION PROJECTS FOR SUCCESS
Publication date: 2013-09-26
Playlist: DrupalCon Prague - September 2013
Description: 
	In this session you will learn how one group within NBCUniversal, one of the world's largest media and entertainment companies (http://www.nbcuni.com/corporate/about-us/), leads the interaction with NBCU Brands (Syfy, NBC.com, NBC News, universal Studios, Bravo, Oxygen, Telemundo, etc.) to plan and execute successful enterprise-level site migrations to a centrally-devloped Drupal platform.

Creating a successful path for migrating from platform to platform can be a challenge - creating this path in a large enterprise organization with multiple partners, each with very strong brand identities, is a much greater challenge. In this session we will discuss how we plan and manage the complex interactions with our brand partners to ensure success - the methods and tools we use to mitigate risk; empower our developers; and leverage the Drupal community to further enhance our platform and overall goals at NBCUniversal.

Presenters are:
* Adam Asch, Director, Program Operations, NBCUniversal; adzuki3 on drupal.org; @adamasch
* Chris Herring, Director, Publishing Products & Services; cherringland on drupal.org; @cherringland
* James Kutz, Implementation Manager, Product Operations; jckutz on drupal.org; @jckutz

	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,220
let's go okay being agile were very

00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:12,509
timely and we're back all right hi

00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:15,750
everybody so my name is Adam ash that's

00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:19,230
James cuts that's Chris herring we're

00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:22,500
from NBC Universal and we'll talk a

00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:24,600
little bit about what we each do but the

00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:27,480
topic that we're speaking about today is

00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:30,810
really on what we've learned over the

00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:34,980
last year and a half two years of trying

00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:36,989
to move our organization onto the Drupal

00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:39,719
platform a centralized Jubal platform

00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:42,570
for everybody before we started doing

00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:44,129
this different parts of our company and

00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:47,190
we'll talk about that a little bit we're

00:00:44,129 --> 00:00:51,059
each on their own either platform or

00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:53,520
instance of Drupal or custom platform

00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:56,039
yeah and the truth of the matter is they

00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,469
were on lots of different that's true

00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:00,239
and as an organization the decision was

00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:03,120
made to really make a push for going to

00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:05,280
one centralized platform that we could

00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,770
take advantage of as an organization and

00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,740
being a extremely large organization

00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:14,010
which we'll talk about momentarily we

00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:17,150
account for many many challenges that we

00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:19,590
have come up with ways to address

00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:23,670
starting with the beginning of our

00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:25,259
projects and what we very often see and

00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:26,930
I think that a lot of folks have this

00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:29,130
same experience is when we start

00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:32,490
projects and we had started projects in

00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:34,229
the past our partners and the people are

00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:36,570
going to work with right away feel like

00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:39,210
their thing is the most unique and

00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:40,890
interesting thing in the world and one

00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:43,860
centralized platform couldn't really

00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:45,540
address their needs that most times when

00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:47,189
we start any project with any client or

00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:48,750
any partner right away they were

00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:52,530
thinking that that is something that

00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:54,540
isn't possible a lot of folks come into

00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:57,540
our first initial meetings with a

00:01:54,540 --> 00:02:00,149
picture or they go out to get a design

00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:01,799
before even starting the project and

00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:03,780
they handed to us and say here just

00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:06,360
build that how hard could it be right

00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:09,750
and then of course we all get the

00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:11,700
question is is it done pretty much from

00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:13,380
the initial meeting right okay now that

00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:17,700
you know we want a website

00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:19,110
and so wait why is it why is it and so

00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:21,330
these are kind of the things that we

00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:22,410
have learned to address on a very high

00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:27,390
level and we'll go into a little more

00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:29,940
detail so who are we and what do we do I

00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:31,950
think most people in the room have heard

00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:34,260
of nbcuniversal but i think this slide

00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:38,400
illustrates our challenge pretty pretty

00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:40,620
succinctly which is unlike you know one

00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:43,290
of these brands building a platform or

00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:45,540
content management system for one site

00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:48,570
we have the unique challenge of building

00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:50,730
not only a platform but a process that

00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:53,940
can scale for all of these sites and

00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:55,320
we're not talking about we can talk

00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:56,970
about this a little bit more detail

00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:59,850
later but I don't necessarily mean just

00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:01,950
like a hosting challenge or performance

00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:04,740
challenge I mean the challenge of

00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:06,840
sharing modules or or functioning

00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:09,030
functionality between sites that's

00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:10,860
something that's very difficult to do in

00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:13,200
a large organization like ours because

00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:15,960
each of these brands think that they are

00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,640
unique in one way or another and they

00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:19,440
are of course in a day art and we love

00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:23,670
them and we love their uniqueness but

00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:25,290
they're always listening yeah but I

00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:26,880
think you know what we've learned over

00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:29,010
the years and not just the last two

00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:32,180
years but we the three of us in our

00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:34,950
entire team have many many probably

00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:37,650
dozens of decades of years collectively

00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:40,440
of experience building websites is that

00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:42,750
if you strip away the chrome and the

00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:45,060
design the functionality is very much

00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:47,490
the same across a lot of sites on the

00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:51,810
internet and almost all of our sites

00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:53,580
within the company so this goes into a

00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:56,450
little bit about what each of us do and

00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:59,730
how we actually address this problem so

00:03:56,450 --> 00:04:01,920
starting up at the project is really a

00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:04,800
critical part and so what we found and

00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:07,800
kind of a theme for today is really we

00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:11,280
the way we've I rest the most critical

00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:14,520
places to make our project successful

00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:16,350
and this kind of leads into a little bit

00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:18,239
about what each of us do so in the

00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:21,120
organization I'm responsible for the

00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:24,030
process we follow Chris is responsible

00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,740
for the platform we build on and James

00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:27,000
is responsible for the implementations

00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:30,330
on the platform execute

00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,610
this so we've addressed each of these

00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:34,620
things within our process but each of us

00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:35,880
really own a piece of this so when we're

00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:37,950
talking about the process we're talking

00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:39,570
about the roles and responsibilities of

00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:42,240
the people that are on the teams we put

00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:44,370
together and the control mechanisms we

00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,380
put in place for actually following our

00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:48,390
process we're talking about building a

00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:50,220
foundational core platform and we call

00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:52,620
it the core team and the core platform

00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:55,800
and we actually call it publisher seven

00:04:52,620 --> 00:05:00,270
it's our version of Drupal 7 copyright

00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:02,340
Chris Herren ed and Chris hey yes and

00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:04,380
and James is responsible the execution

00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:08,130
of this so James really is feeling the

00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:10,230
brunt of our partners needs and desires

00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:12,030
all of the time because he's really at

00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:14,370
the forefront of actually making these

00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:16,860
things happen for them that's right but

00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:19,140
actually with a clear process a good

00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:22,200
platform my job essentially it's pretty

00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:26,940
easy so which he'll tell you after the

00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:28,919
he's lying so the first thing we did was

00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:31,380
look at actually what our core platform

00:05:28,919 --> 00:05:33,150
will be and chris is responsible for

00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:35,460
that platform yeah so the team that I

00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:38,010
manage for the company is responsible

00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:41,400
for building this product which we call

00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:42,930
publisher core and the thing that's

00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:45,300
interesting that you're going to hear

00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:48,030
about today is we use the same process

00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:50,160
that we're talking about today not only

00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:51,570
just for building the sites that we

00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,970
mentioned earlier for all of those

00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:57,110
brands but we use that same process for

00:05:53,970 --> 00:06:00,479
building this product and the products

00:05:57,110 --> 00:06:03,060
the products built on dribbble 7

00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:05,700
obviously but what we do is we focus on

00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:09,060
core functionality that is common across

00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:11,130
the company common things like editorial

00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:13,620
workflow that's very common for

00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:15,630
scheduling previewing publishing and

00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:18,590
syndicating content within the company

00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:20,850
or externally common functionality

00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:23,540
integration with third parties for

00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:26,820
analytics and content distribution and

00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:28,950
video management for example so we want

00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:31,320
to build those common areas of

00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:34,890
functionality in the form of typically

00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:36,760
Drupal modules by the way and make them

00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:39,310
available for all brands

00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:41,440
so when publisher is installed for the

00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:44,050
first time and made available for a

00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:46,420
brand on our hosting platform all of

00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:48,250
that functionality it just needs to be

00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:49,990
configured and usually it's just a

00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:52,600
simple configuration screen where you're

00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:56,860
putting in your keys that enable that

00:06:52,600 --> 00:07:00,000
functionality for your brand but that's

00:06:56,860 --> 00:07:02,560
the job of the platform and of this team

00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,930
so as you can see when we start doing a

00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:07,270
project already out of the box we have

00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:11,200
some standardizations that were starting

00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:12,880
to work with so the first thing we did

00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:14,680
when we were applying this as Chris

00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,420
alluded to was we had to come up with a

00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:18,250
process that works within the

00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:21,580
organization but then works across our

00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:24,190
partner platform implementations as well

00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:26,290
and so we started actually applying

00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:28,930
agile methodologies into the

00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:30,220
organization a few years ago and what

00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:31,900
we've done over time we started

00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:35,530
basically with kind of a scrum framework

00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:37,810
and then over time we actually applied

00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:39,280
more and more lean and conv and other

00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:41,620
agile methodologies that helped us

00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:43,480
actually manage projects within the

00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:45,820
organization it's a complex organization

00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:48,520
one methodology doesn't necessarily

00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:49,720
scale across everything we need to do so

00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:51,610
what we've done is we've created an

00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:54,460
agile framework an agile process that we

00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:58,000
apply to doing this so on the bottom row

00:07:54,460 --> 00:08:00,730
here is our agile project sdlc or

00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,020
lifecycle basically those are the phases

00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:03,330
and we're not going to go into those in

00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:05,800
detail today but just to get an idea

00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:07,900
that we go through multiple phases that

00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:09,670
address specifically how to successfully

00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:11,890
start a project through how do we

00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:13,600
successfully deliver and measure what it

00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:15,070
is that we've delivered we'll talk about

00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:16,390
some of those things today those are the

00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:18,730
critical things to actually what we're

00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:20,260
doing today but at a high level what

00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:22,990
we're really always addressing is what

00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:26,170
you see at the top which is critically

00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:28,210
doing a great job of defining what we're

00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:29,400
doing delivering the value and the

00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:32,410
benefit of what we're going to do

00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:34,540
delivering benefit and value and then

00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:37,120
measuring benefiting value and so

00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:39,160
throughout the lifecycle of our projects

00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,510
we're always looking to do one of those

00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:42,520
things and those are the three things

00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:44,530
we're basically focusing on to make sure

00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:46,770
that we are successful each time the

00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:49,360
goal of all of our process is really to

00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:50,460
reduce the risk of failure that doesn't

00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,410
mean we won't but

00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:56,030
means we've learned at least in our

00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:59,850
organization how to try to address that

00:08:56,030 --> 00:09:02,040
so basically when we're getting into the

00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:03,930
defining phase you're going to see a

00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:05,460
theme here where we basically start at a

00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:07,500
really high level and then we start

00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:09,060
breaking it down so one of the first

00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:10,980
things we like to do when we're starting

00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:13,200
to work with our brands is really start

00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:14,580
to identify first of all what are they

00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:18,030
going to leverage from our core

00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:20,820
publisher 7 platform what's going to be

00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:22,020
custom work and in some cases what are

00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:23,310
we going to develop as part of the

00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:25,830
project that's going to go back and

00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:28,050
become part of our core product because

00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:29,820
other brands are interested in it or we

00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:31,260
think it might scale out to those brands

00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:33,480
so these are some things that we're

00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:35,790
going to identify pretty much you know

00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:38,310
right in the beginning of the project

00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:40,530
we're also going to look at on both

00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:43,050
sides once we sort of define whether

00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:45,390
something is going into the backlog of

00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:47,640
our core team or whether it's going into

00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:50,250
our implementation team at both ends we

00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:51,780
want to start to get an idea of you know

00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:54,030
how long this thing's going to take what

00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:55,680
is it how big is it how complexity is it

00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:57,810
and we want to start getting high level

00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:59,760
estimates the nice thing about working

00:09:57,810 --> 00:10:01,980
in a common platform and having some

00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:04,250
experiences with some similar brands is

00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:07,770
that you know a lot of this is

00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:09,120
repeatable so and we're also we'll get

00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:11,010
into this a little bit but we're also

00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,570
working with teams and those teams have

00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:14,340
a little bit of history but even if

00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:17,040
we're spinning up a team we can start to

00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:18,660
talk about this at a high level and get

00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,160
a feel for you know what is the

00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:22,500
complexity just given our own

00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:24,450
experiences and the experiences of other

00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:26,130
teams within our group yeah I think the

00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:28,410
important part here just to add is that

00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:31,710
just because we're doing an agile

00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:33,660
development process does it mean that we

00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:35,730
don't estimate and try to project how

00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:37,770
long a project is going to take I think

00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:39,090
a lot of our brands thank a July don't

00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:41,370
have to plan and it's really quite the

00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:42,990
opposite do we do more planning than we

00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:44,930
ever thought we were going to absolutely

00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:47,070
yeah and that's one of the critical

00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:48,810
issues that we address all the time one

00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:52,230
of the key misconceptions of doing agile

00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:54,420
first of all but also that good project

00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:55,680
management is good project management

00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:57,240
regardless of the methodology you're

00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,030
following and it's always really

00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:01,770
important to understand that any

00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:03,180
customer any partner we have really

00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:04,240
what's important to them is when are

00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:05,770
they going to get what they're

00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:08,320
in the beginning number one but number

00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:10,209
two I think it's a misconception that

00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,640
agile doesn't work well with deadlines

00:11:10,209 --> 00:11:16,110
and we work in an industry where you

00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:18,850
could imagine has very very strict

00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:20,380
unmovable deadlines when a TV show is

00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:21,640
going to premiere on the network it's

00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:23,320
they're not going to wait a day because

00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:24,610
we don't have the website up when a

00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:26,529
movies coming out they're not going to

00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:28,690
delay the premiere because something's

00:11:26,529 --> 00:11:30,880
not right cancel the Olympics and we

00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:32,110
can't move the Olympics believe me so

00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:34,330
you know those are the kind of things

00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:36,310
that we address all the time but yes so

00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:38,020
what we've actually done and we'll talk

00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:39,910
about that throughout is managing by

00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:43,240
scope but also determining what the

00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:44,770
value of things is so I talked about our

00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:46,300
approach where we start really high

00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:48,190
level and we start breaking it down one

00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:49,870
of the first things we want to do when

00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:52,480
we're talking with the brand is get

00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:54,700
their vision so in the past we might and

00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:57,520
many of you might experience this you

00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:59,200
know our brands come to us and they say

00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:00,940
you know build me a website and that's

00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,200
sort of their vision I want a website at

00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:03,670
the end of the day well there's a lot

00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:05,920
more to that and so we'll run an

00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:07,860
exercise will actually dig into this is

00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:09,820
actually what you're seeing here is

00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:12,220
actually the outcome of one of our

00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:14,290
exercises which is we actually want them

00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:16,270
as a brand that you know sort of the

00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:18,700
stakeholders to get together and agree

00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:21,250
upon what the vision is for the project

00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:23,589
you know and that vision will carry out

00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:26,110
throughout the project and really aligns

00:12:23,589 --> 00:12:28,029
everybody at the beginning of the

00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:30,370
project and through the end and helps us

00:12:28,029 --> 00:12:32,140
really determine the priority of what

00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:34,089
we're doing yeah and I've seen the teams

00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:35,950
just say well that doesn't align with

00:12:34,089 --> 00:12:38,709
the vision they actually remember it you

00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:40,690
know for lis crumbs in before if I've

00:12:38,709 --> 00:12:42,640
sprints in actually remember that you

00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:44,860
know of new feature requests doesn't

00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:50,020
align with the original vision so that's

00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:51,490
healthy absolutely so we also then take

00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:53,380
you know that after that vision

00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:55,690
statement will gather high level feature

00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:57,250
sets and this looks like it can look

00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:58,959
like a variety of things depending on

00:12:57,250 --> 00:13:02,050
who we're working with this is just an

00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:03,790
example of and we're giving you a little

00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:05,800
bit of preview of how we actually then

00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:07,420
further break that out but sometimes

00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:09,490
it's kind of a one-liner with a little

00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:11,589
bit of a description sometimes we have a

00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:13,779
little bit more context there but the

00:13:11,589 --> 00:13:14,540
idea is let's get the whole feature set

00:13:13,779 --> 00:13:16,010
of the project

00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:18,140
it may not be every single thing that

00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:20,090
we're going to do but let's let's bound

00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:21,950
this thing let's figure out what it is

00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:24,140
and what it isn't so that we can start

00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:25,400
having the conversation about scope and

00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:28,160
you know given that we work with

00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:31,340
deadlines will often start with the date

00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:33,530
and then get into the project and so the

00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:37,580
really the best way then to manage that

00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:39,860
is either through resources that's you

00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:44,390
know that's one option that we don't

00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:45,970
have yeah and don't always have and the

00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:48,830
other way is through scope and it's not

00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:52,070
eliminating large chunks of scope it's

00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:55,970
eliminating scope of pieces along the

00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:57,410
way and a great example of that I just

00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:59,480
like this example cuz it happens quite

00:13:57,410 --> 00:14:01,430
often is one of the first requirements

00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:04,910
most of our partners ask for is a photo

00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:06,350
gallery and one of the first first

00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:09,680
requires we got when we've doing and by

00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:10,970
the way this is most of these images are

00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:13,160
coming from our actual one of our actual

00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:16,340
projects NBC com if there's a redesign

00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:18,020
of NBC com one of the first things they

00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:19,760
said before we really got started with

00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:21,020
them was we need a photo gallery and

00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:23,270
they thought that was the requirement

00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:25,280
they had they were perfectly happy and

00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:27,170
satisfied with we gave you a requirement

00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:28,340
just build it and they had a comp for

00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:30,230
what they did have an alien's they had a

00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:31,820
picture of it but but what they've

00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:33,290
learned really soon out there after when

00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:34,880
we said that's not really a requirement

00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:36,620
what do you mean you know what what do

00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:38,750
we actually mean by that well how many

00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:40,130
images go into the photo gallery what

00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:42,170
sizes are they where do they come from

00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:43,750
what happens when we don't have a

00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:45,770
license for something what happens when

00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:47,090
something's not available any longer

00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:48,830
what happens when you click on it you

00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:50,090
could imagine all of the things that can

00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:52,430
happen when you have photos in the

00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:54,320
gallery and what what can come up they

00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:56,780
were actually happy that we actually did

00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:58,550
that because previously people would

00:14:56,780 --> 00:15:00,770
take that I want a photo gallery and

00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:03,350
build them something that more likely

00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:04,970
than not didn't satisfy their need but

00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:06,320
someone took the assumption though well

00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:08,120
I think this is what you mean and we

00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,110
actually say we don't want to think what

00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:11,180
you mean we want to know what you mean

00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:12,620
even if it's not perfect we can interact

00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:14,450
with it and then we could talk about

00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:16,250
changing it so that's a good example of

00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:17,960
a high level feature might start out

00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:19,930
with photo gallery but then will

00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:22,220
decompose very quickly into more detail

00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:24,440
once again what's critical for us is

00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:26,840
that we are estimating and planning all

00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:28,279
throughout the lifecycle of this project

00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:29,930
starting from the very

00:15:28,279 --> 00:15:31,790
beginning we're starting with very high

00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:34,550
level estimates what we call t-shirt

00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:36,920
sizing so small medium and large we have

00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:38,569
a very good idea based on some team

00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:40,490
performance and velocity and the types

00:15:38,569 --> 00:15:42,379
of work we're doing so remember where

00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:43,790
once we're on a centralized platform

00:15:42,379 --> 00:15:45,589
we're going to be doing similar types of

00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:47,540
work so it makes it a little easier for

00:15:45,589 --> 00:15:50,389
us to then project what certain other

00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:52,790
things will be like so NBC com took X to

00:15:50,389 --> 00:15:54,139
do this thing another partner will take

00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:56,300
a similar amount of time to do a similar

00:15:54,139 --> 00:15:58,610
thing so we can project in a high level

00:15:56,300 --> 00:16:00,319
out early and then as we move into the

00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:02,689
project we're decomposing into more

00:16:00,319 --> 00:16:05,149
granular estimates so we go from t-shirt

00:16:02,689 --> 00:16:07,309
sizing to Fibonacci sequence story point

00:16:05,149 --> 00:16:08,930
sizing to get our velocities and then

00:16:07,309 --> 00:16:11,870
when we do the work we get into tasks

00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:13,879
and so we're at the actual level of

00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:16,879
effort when we're working during

00:16:13,879 --> 00:16:19,309
iteration we're doing ours so we get go

00:16:16,879 --> 00:16:21,290
along the whole way doing that and the

00:16:19,309 --> 00:16:22,970
way this sort of translates to the team

00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:24,860
is that we're doing what i like to call

00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:27,709
just in time planning so at a high level

00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:29,689
we're really truly to try and get an

00:16:27,709 --> 00:16:31,610
understanding of how big this project is

00:16:29,689 --> 00:16:33,170
you know largely is it going to fit in

00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:35,360
the time frame that we have how many

00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:37,939
resources do we need where do we need to

00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:40,250
look to sort of leverage more of what

00:16:37,939 --> 00:16:42,829
another team did etc when we get into

00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:46,309
story sizing now we actually have a

00:16:42,829 --> 00:16:47,389
consumable digestible requirement that

00:16:46,309 --> 00:16:50,000
we're actually going to share with the

00:16:47,389 --> 00:16:52,430
team and the idea there is to get them

00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,470
to ask questions and talk about it when

00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:55,670
we get into the task level everybody's

00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:56,990
clear on what we're doing and we're

00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:59,389
really just sort of laying out a plan

00:16:56,990 --> 00:17:01,610
for our iteration so it's just in time

00:16:59,389 --> 00:17:03,259
planning it's not doing that task level

00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:04,669
at the beginning of the project it's

00:17:03,259 --> 00:17:07,189
doing it just when we're ready to start

00:17:04,669 --> 00:17:09,740
executing on that yeah and at the task

00:17:07,189 --> 00:17:11,600
level I like that the team agrees to the

00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:13,819
commitment that's right that's right not

00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:15,049
any one person so one example of this is

00:17:13,819 --> 00:17:16,520
really it's there I know this is hard to

00:17:15,049 --> 00:17:18,740
see but i'll show you another slide in a

00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:20,809
moment but this is once again we do

00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:22,549
these exercises with our teams to

00:17:20,809 --> 00:17:24,679
actually elaborate and get those

00:17:22,549 --> 00:17:26,750
information so earlier stuff one of the

00:17:24,679 --> 00:17:28,730
vision and we often get very long vision

00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:30,080
statements that basically have a lot

00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:31,970
more information in them that's part of

00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:34,970
the one we saw this although you really

00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:37,280
can't see it is actually our very early

00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:39,110
in a project planning kind of

00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,850
elaborating on how long some of these

00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:42,000
big sections will take from the t-shirt

00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:43,590
size point of view

00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,380
basically what this is is then put into

00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:49,500
something like this so we translated it

00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:51,240
into this yeah so you know this again

00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:53,640
still a little bit high level this is

00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:56,280
not a pro self project plan that has

00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:57,960
every task right now but this is enough

00:17:56,280 --> 00:18:00,990
this is enough for us to sort of set a

00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:03,660
date to understand you know that how

00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:05,970
much time and this ultimately leads into

00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:07,560
what I call sort of giving each feature

00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:10,080
set in allowance you know if we're

00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:11,790
restricted by a date and resources we're

00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:14,460
going to control scope right so we want

00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:16,230
to really focus on what the priority is

00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:18,300
of something and sort of give more and

00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:20,280
allow more of an allowance to that

00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:21,750
feature set and then things that are

00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:23,010
lower priority you know doesn't mean

00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:24,270
we're not going to get them done but

00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:25,830
we're just not going to spend a lot of

00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:28,620
time on and this is sort of the

00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:31,380
beginning of starting to you know put

00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:32,550
that together very high levels still we

00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:34,970
also have to remember that we have

00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:37,380
executive level sponsorship and support

00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:39,090
very often regardless of the methodology

00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:40,350
we're following people want to have an

00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:42,060
idea that they're comfortable that we're

00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:43,590
going to hit dates that we have things

00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:45,900
laid out that things are planned for

00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:47,340
once again we're still agile we're being

00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:49,470
very flexible about what we're doing

00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:50,790
when we're doing it managing by scope

00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:53,460
but that doesn't preclude us from

00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:55,620
needing to actually plan things out a

00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:57,930
little more elaborately than you often

00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:59,040
see in some agile project and again you

00:18:57,930 --> 00:19:00,540
know a lot of the things that we're

00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:02,100
doing because we're using a cognitive

00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:05,640
platform some of these things are

00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:07,350
repeatable so we can in some sense start

00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:10,380
putting this together and really getting

00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:12,560
giving the the brand kind of a good idea

00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:15,330
of what the project's going to look like

00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:16,860
so we're really as we move forward from

00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:18,690
those high level I just want a photo

00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:20,730
gallery we move into more detailed

00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:22,800
requirements detailed stories that

00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:24,210
actually start talking about not only

00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:26,190
what we're doing but the acceptance

00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:28,260
criteria for delivering them and we just

00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:30,120
came from a session talking about excuse

00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:33,000
me BDD behavior driven development which

00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:34,890
we very much support and our acceptance

00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,080
criteria although we aren't doing a

00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:38,790
formal BDD yet we write our acceptance

00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:41,640
criteria so that we can actually number

00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:43,650
one and very well define when we're done

00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:45,720
with delivering something but also we

00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:47,760
start with those as a platform for our

00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:50,040
testing so it gets into a lot of

00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:52,980
decomposition as we go along with the

00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:54,470
more detailed stories at this point in

00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:55,830
our project we're also getting

00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:57,840
wireframes

00:19:55,830 --> 00:20:01,980
and the difference between a wire frame

00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:03,840
and a comp is that this is not a

00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:05,519
definite thing that we're going to

00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:08,100
deliver we don't want to ever have our

00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:09,600
partners confuse a finished looking

00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:12,480
picture with what they're actually going

00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:14,970
to get online I mean we haven't we've

00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:16,710
just started doing in browser design and

00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:18,450
I think that's really a great step

00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:21,750
forward to what we're doing when we're

00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:23,519
working in a certain platform we believe

00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:24,870
that it's best to move towards showing

00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:27,029
people what things are going to look for

00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:29,159
on that platform as opposed to a piece

00:20:27,029 --> 00:20:31,049
of paper number one it's interactive but

00:20:29,159 --> 00:20:33,299
number two what's on paper doesn't

00:20:31,049 --> 00:20:34,500
always translate very well into what

00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:36,419
people are going to get at the end and

00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:38,399
we don't want to them to have poor

00:20:36,419 --> 00:20:40,110
poorly conceived misconception of what

00:20:38,399 --> 00:20:42,000
they're going to actually get so our

00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:44,669
rule is that the requirement is what

00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,590
comes first the wireframe is actually a

00:20:44,669 --> 00:20:49,260
visualization of the words of the

00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:52,350
requirement we know because we work with

00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:53,490
teams actually all over the world and we

00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:55,559
work with teams that speak many

00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:57,120
languages that a picture is very

00:20:55,559 --> 00:20:59,010
important for us to be able to translate

00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:01,289
our words correctly so it's critical

00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:03,480
that not that we have them but we don't

00:21:01,289 --> 00:21:05,370
want to confuse the picture with the

00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:07,380
written requirement we also want to make

00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:09,120
sure that it's easily updated because

00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:11,070
depending on whether we have aux

00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,720
resource on the team or not and often we

00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:14,100
don't we might have to update a

00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,200
requirement we want to be able to update

00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:20,750
the picture as quickly because that will

00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:23,460
be the default that people work from so

00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:27,299
again this theme of breaking things down

00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:29,549
so once we get into actually writing

00:21:27,299 --> 00:21:32,279
stories now we can actually start to lay

00:21:29,549 --> 00:21:34,950
these stories out maybe even epics which

00:21:32,279 --> 00:21:37,529
are sort of high-level themes across

00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:40,529
iterations and what this again helps

00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:44,309
enforce is how does this how does this

00:21:40,529 --> 00:21:47,760
go how does this align to our timeline

00:21:44,309 --> 00:21:49,529
the other thing that we like to do is in

00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:52,769
this actual example we're actually using

00:21:49,529 --> 00:21:54,779
two teams to execute on the project but

00:21:52,769 --> 00:21:56,760
we also have things prioritized for our

00:21:54,779 --> 00:21:59,159
core team and we also have things that

00:21:56,760 --> 00:22:02,370
our support team is is executing on as

00:21:59,159 --> 00:22:05,010
well so again yes we're using an agile

00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:07,049
process but you know there is a lot of

00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:08,820
planning that needs to go on when you're

00:22:07,049 --> 00:22:11,669
working across multiple teams

00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:14,220
and really the key is to define this

00:22:11,669 --> 00:22:16,080
stuff start breaking it down in such a

00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:17,820
way and again that just in time planning

00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:20,909
which is getting at the level of detail

00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:22,529
that you need at the right time so just

00:22:20,909 --> 00:22:24,480
to reiterate this goes from this which

00:22:22,529 --> 00:22:26,159
is a very high level plan to this which

00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:28,080
is a more detailed plan I think that

00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:30,659
we've all seen and since we're doing

00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:32,039
this for a while now and we're doing but

00:22:30,659 --> 00:22:34,679
we're doing with a lot of folks for the

00:22:32,039 --> 00:22:35,970
first time that they're a little bit

00:22:34,679 --> 00:22:38,130
surprised with the amount of work that

00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:40,559
has to go into just setting this up just

00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:42,210
getting good requirements just really

00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:44,039
getting to the level of planning that

00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:45,929
they really want that's accurate it's

00:22:44,039 --> 00:22:48,779
very easy to give someone a plan that

00:22:45,929 --> 00:22:50,730
looks like this and not really map to it

00:22:48,779 --> 00:22:53,039
not actually delivered to it it's really

00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:55,350
not that easy to deliver to this and we

00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:56,600
people expect that we will so that's the

00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:58,740
big one of the big challenges for us

00:22:56,600 --> 00:23:00,990
developments developing something is

00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:02,370
expensive working out some of these

00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:04,649
planning issues working out better

00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:06,629
requirements is lot less expensive than

00:23:04,649 --> 00:23:08,250
trying to figure out what we want what

00:23:06,629 --> 00:23:10,169
through building it so that's one of the

00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:12,450
things and the other thing I just wanted

00:23:10,169 --> 00:23:14,850
to add is that my team's publisher

00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:16,620
roadmap is influenced by the various

00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:18,690
implementation planning that happens

00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:21,779
right so if I see common threads where

00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:24,179
three or four brands need a certain type

00:23:21,779 --> 00:23:26,820
of functionality I'll prioritize that

00:23:24,179 --> 00:23:28,740
for for our team so that we can deliver

00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:30,690
that and build it once and then make it

00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:31,950
available for the implementations and

00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:34,559
then it's less work on the

00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:37,110
implementation team as well so there's

00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:39,419
this constant realignment of roadmaps

00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:40,830
that's happening continuously and you

00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:42,990
know one thing we didn't really mention

00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:45,389
but even though we do sort of plan this

00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:47,220
out the plans change right and so we

00:23:45,389 --> 00:23:49,860
need to be flexible and understand that

00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:51,899
but having a plan and then changing it

00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:53,100
now you know what the impact is right so

00:23:51,899 --> 00:23:54,720
if you didn't have a plan and you were

00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:56,669
just sort of iterating through this and

00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,350
hoping you would hit the date you really

00:23:56,669 --> 00:24:00,299
wouldn't understand the impact of a

00:23:58,350 --> 00:24:02,669
change we certainly welcome changes into

00:24:00,299 --> 00:24:04,320
our process but at the same time we have

00:24:02,669 --> 00:24:05,929
to understand what the impact is and

00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:09,240
it's really our job to really educate

00:24:05,929 --> 00:24:11,399
the brand's about what those what those

00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:12,720
impacts are and in many cases it's

00:24:11,399 --> 00:24:15,200
multiple brands that are affected by

00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:18,330
that so it's a it's a big challenge but

00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:20,639
through collaboration communication some

00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:22,289
of the groups that we've set up across

00:24:20,639 --> 00:24:24,659
the organization we're able to

00:24:22,289 --> 00:24:26,789
communicate that and you know just

00:24:24,659 --> 00:24:29,460
somewhat some degree get a little bit by

00:24:26,789 --> 00:24:31,500
in on that right so we've going from the

00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:33,990
defining process which is the beginning

00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:35,309
of our project life cycle where we're

00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:36,960
setting up making sure a really good

00:24:35,309 --> 00:24:38,909
requirements make sure we decompose to

00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:41,159
have enough information to start

00:24:38,909 --> 00:24:42,870
measuring out and be able to deliver and

00:24:41,159 --> 00:24:45,299
now we're going into our delivery phase

00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:46,830
which encompasses our setting up our

00:24:45,299 --> 00:24:48,899
environments making sure our teams are

00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:50,580
fully in place doing our release

00:24:48,899 --> 00:24:52,409
planning as we were just doing and now

00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:53,460
we're really doing development and once

00:24:52,409 --> 00:24:55,980
again we're always thinking about

00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:58,500
delivering benefit and value and

00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:59,850
managing by scope to make sure that we

00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:02,879
fit in the timelines that we're looking

00:24:59,850 --> 00:25:04,500
for I think one of the you know besides

00:25:02,879 --> 00:25:07,289
requirements I think one of the most

00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:09,539
important things that we are doing is

00:25:07,289 --> 00:25:12,539
really setting up the right team

00:25:09,539 --> 00:25:15,330
structure and this is hopefully a it's a

00:25:12,539 --> 00:25:18,480
very complicated diagram but it really

00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:20,340
explains sort of how we how we have

00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:22,409
teams different teams doing different

00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:25,139
activities but again this is across a

00:25:22,409 --> 00:25:27,870
large organization so in some cases

00:25:25,139 --> 00:25:30,539
we're working with multiple teams are

00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:32,070
the output of one particular teams work

00:25:30,539 --> 00:25:34,350
so it's really important that we have

00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:36,179
teams of people and not individuals so

00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:37,980
you know first we have sort of a large

00:25:36,179 --> 00:25:40,289
team of people who are working on

00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:43,429
requirements we have you know

00:25:40,289 --> 00:25:45,570
stakeholders we have designers we have

00:25:43,429 --> 00:25:48,059
requirements engineers which is kind of

00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:50,309
a a little bit more than a business

00:25:48,059 --> 00:25:52,200
analyst all these people are

00:25:50,309 --> 00:25:55,260
contributing with our product owner with

00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:57,779
our brands to produce requirements we

00:25:55,260 --> 00:26:01,740
then have and this is typically for a

00:25:57,779 --> 00:26:03,840
large project we then have tech leads

00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:06,480
sometimes it's usually multiple tech

00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:09,899
leads on a project so that they can help

00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:11,159
sort of set the approach right as all of

00:26:09,899 --> 00:26:14,159
you know with Drupal there's a million

00:26:11,159 --> 00:26:16,769
ways to do one thing we're trying to

00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:18,929
create not only use a standard platform

00:26:16,769 --> 00:26:21,000
use the standard process but really down

00:26:18,929 --> 00:26:23,129
into how we're implementing the approach

00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,869
that we're taking on certain things we

00:26:23,129 --> 00:26:25,380
want that to be somewhat consistent and

00:26:24,869 --> 00:26:27,900
we do that

00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:30,360
with our tech leads and our tech leads

00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:32,310
talking to one another and working

00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:35,730
closely together and then that can sort

00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:39,210
of that approach really spans out to the

00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:40,650
teams so once again it's it looks

00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:43,560
complex and maybe a little complex but

00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:45,180
uh it is complex a little bit it's not

00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:46,860
so simple just to say we have I think

00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:48,960
it's complex because it is complex well

00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:51,060
it's not good I guess you could say it

00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:53,100
but once again people don't realize

00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:54,960
sometimes and this illustrates it there

00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:56,520
is some complexity going on here we're

00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:58,920
being very diligent to manage it in a

00:26:56,520 --> 00:27:00,600
way that it's is opaque to our end users

00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:02,850
we don't want people to have to worry

00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:05,100
about this we manage this so that once

00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:06,630
again are our partners and our clients

00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:08,370
and our end users they don't have to

00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:10,080
deal with this so we do and so we can

00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:11,850
answer those original questions like

00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:13,560
when will it be done right we can

00:27:11,850 --> 00:27:16,140
accurately answer and we've organized

00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:17,580
our teams and James alluded to this in a

00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:19,530
way that we've actually created a

00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:21,660
position for people just to help get

00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:23,130
requirements done because we found that

00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:25,050
one of our gaps in our organization and

00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:27,660
frankly I found many projects through

00:27:25,050 --> 00:27:29,340
the years is that we often work faster

00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:31,380
than the amount of consumable

00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:33,270
requirements we have ready to go and so

00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:35,310
we created a group of people that just

00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:37,260
helped build the backlog so that we have

00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:39,450
consumable requirements for the teams

00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:42,090
all of the time it's something that they

00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:44,730
just that they only focus on that so

00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:46,800
this is a actual sample of one of the

00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:48,270
iteration or iterations or two weeks

00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:51,660
this is really our day-to-day schedule

00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:53,850
and it's consistent so every every day

00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:55,740
everybody knows what meetings are

00:27:53,850 --> 00:27:57,300
happening what where we are in the

00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:59,190
process what everybody should be

00:27:57,300 --> 00:28:00,780
focusing on and the interesting thing is

00:27:59,190 --> 00:28:03,210
that we actually in that two-week

00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:05,640
process we're actually starting at the

00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:07,470
end of the iteration we're starting to

00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:11,100
plan for the next iteration and that

00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:12,690
really is can be challenging and it

00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:14,700
actually it turns out that developers

00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:17,580
and testers actually like sort of a

00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:20,250
consistent schedule imagine that so by

00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:22,770
having a rigorous schedule and really

00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:25,620
sort of moving heaven and earth to get

00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:27,360
everything in by the time and keeping

00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:28,740
the meetings is really important to us

00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:31,980
because that way we could create

00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:34,310
consistency and really relevant

00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:36,440
predictability and all of this is really

00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:39,050
that predictability you know we find

00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:41,030
that once we start delivering while we

00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:42,740
still have that end date sometimes we

00:28:41,030 --> 00:28:45,260
have brands that have create sort of

00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:46,820
artificial deadlines within that project

00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:48,920
and we find that once we start

00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:51,320
delivering every two weeks and there's

00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:53,810
transparency and they really know to

00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:56,600
expect Oh at the demo I'm going to see

00:28:53,810 --> 00:28:58,820
these 20 things that the team is working

00:28:56,600 --> 00:29:01,280
on and I know I'm going to see exactly

00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:02,930
that a lot of those other deadlines sort

00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:04,760
of vanish and we start having different

00:29:02,930 --> 00:29:07,190
conversations and then we can start

00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:08,600
talking about you know versus are you

00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:10,790
going to meet that date when am I going

00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:13,250
to get it we can start relaxing a little

00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:14,990
bit and start talking about what's the

00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:16,730
best thing that we can be doing and

00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:18,740
really start moving around and you know

00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:21,110
that's that's really you know I think

00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:22,250
all of us here without in the one of the

00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:25,130
presentations we saw this morning

00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:27,920
somebody mentioned that you know we

00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:29,960
don't just do what we do just to

00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:31,820
sometimes we do it for a paycheck or

00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:33,020
keep ourselves occupied to keep

00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:35,330
ourselves out of trouble during the day

00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:38,210
right but I think all of us are here

00:29:35,330 --> 00:29:42,170
focused on quality right and so if we

00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:46,250
can build quality into our process and

00:29:42,170 --> 00:29:48,400
really allow for you know changes and

00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:51,350
and the sort of the best possible

00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:52,850
approach to things to come forward you

00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:54,260
know then we're doing our job yeah the

00:29:52,850 --> 00:29:56,630
only thing I would add to this slide is

00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:58,010
that I think predictability breeds trust

00:29:56,630 --> 00:29:59,600
with our brands and that's something

00:29:58,010 --> 00:30:01,280
we've struggled with for a number of

00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:03,170
years is getting the brands to just

00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:04,580
really trust that when we say something

00:30:03,170 --> 00:30:06,620
is going to be delivered every two weeks

00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:08,600
it actually is and by having that

00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:12,530
predictability it actually helps with

00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:16,010
that trust factor so continuing we're

00:30:12,530 --> 00:30:19,130
decomposing further into our so this is

00:30:16,010 --> 00:30:21,470
just another look at you know that last

00:30:19,130 --> 00:30:24,650
step we said so we have our you know our

00:30:21,470 --> 00:30:26,330
high-level sizes we get into stories now

00:30:24,650 --> 00:30:27,920
we're down at the task level and you

00:30:26,330 --> 00:30:29,870
know test level is really we have it

00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:32,630
broken down understood and we're really

00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:34,730
just trying to map out how are how our

00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:36,320
teams are going to execute across that

00:30:34,730 --> 00:30:37,910
two weeks print two weeks is not a lot

00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:41,270
of time especially when we're talking

00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:43,210
about developing and testing in that

00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:44,870
time frame and being completely

00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:46,330
production-ready doesn't mean we're

00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:47,919
always going to production

00:30:46,330 --> 00:30:49,390
but it does mean production ready so

00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:52,360
that means we're breaking things down

00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:57,370
may be smaller than some some some of

00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:59,440
you used to that's okay maybe where you

00:30:57,370 --> 00:31:01,720
know having more people involved in

00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:04,450
developing one feature right that's not

00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:06,880
so bad maybe we're trying to build you

00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:08,620
know better test cases early on and

00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:11,980
leverage test cases that other teams

00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:13,779
have used and also other functionality

00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:16,029
that other teams of use these are all

00:31:13,779 --> 00:31:18,940
good things and you know that's really

00:31:16,029 --> 00:31:22,950
we really drive it through this what I

00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:25,269
call aggressive iteration schedule and

00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:27,100
of course this is also where we're

00:31:25,269 --> 00:31:28,600
applying during our delivery pays our

00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:31,269
visual design we haven't forgotten them

00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:32,470
but when wireframes were enough to start

00:31:31,269 --> 00:31:33,760
in the beginning to really get started

00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:35,830
working and make sure we're delivering

00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:38,049
the overall framework of what we're

00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:40,840
building we have in parallel the

00:31:38,049 --> 00:31:42,730
designers working on the actual design

00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:44,049
we're going to apply so we haven't

00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:46,480
forgotten it we just want to make sure

00:31:44,049 --> 00:31:48,279
that that the design isn't driving the

00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:50,440
feature data that's not the requirement

00:31:48,279 --> 00:31:52,539
right and you know we can build without

00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:55,179
this we don't need this right we can

00:31:52,539 --> 00:31:57,760
start building back-end functionality

00:31:55,179 --> 00:31:59,710
even front end sort of how we're going

00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:01,870
to use that right this is all theming

00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:03,309
and styling right at this level and we

00:32:01,870 --> 00:32:06,340
can do that later in the project and

00:32:03,309 --> 00:32:07,779
that's sort of where you know that

00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:10,149
that's that's great because now our

00:32:07,779 --> 00:32:11,740
designers can really see what it sort of

00:32:10,149 --> 00:32:13,240
looks like what that functionality looks

00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:16,360
like and what our interactions are going

00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:21,330
to be and start doing that work once

00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:26,080
they sort of deliver us pictures and

00:32:21,330 --> 00:32:27,519
yeah also well this you know you can

00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:29,769
start you want to talk about this one

00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:31,299
I'm going to start the mode one of the

00:32:29,769 --> 00:32:32,830
other most important things although

00:32:31,299 --> 00:32:34,389
there's all pretty important and one of

00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:35,470
the things that we we really feel are

00:32:34,389 --> 00:32:37,840
really important the metrics were

00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:39,490
getting out of this so from the process

00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:40,779
perspective I'm looking for certain

00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:42,519
things out of these I'm looking to make

00:32:40,779 --> 00:32:45,490
sure that our delivering consistent

00:32:42,519 --> 00:32:47,289
velocities that we are addressing the

00:32:45,490 --> 00:32:49,149
numbers that we're seeing and that I

00:32:47,289 --> 00:32:51,789
being responsible for process make sure

00:32:49,149 --> 00:32:53,950
that I'm adjusting the process where I

00:32:51,789 --> 00:32:55,120
see anomalies in the metrics or some of

00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:56,830
the metrics tell me something about

00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:59,549
where the process might not be working

00:32:56,830 --> 00:33:01,830
very well each of us and James

00:32:59,549 --> 00:33:04,049
crystal elaborate use the same metrics

00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:06,179
for different things so we're actually

00:33:04,049 --> 00:33:07,440
you know creating a lot of numbers but

00:33:06,179 --> 00:33:09,509
we're actually getting something out of

00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:11,970
it so yeah you know I would say you know

00:33:09,509 --> 00:33:14,279
we definitely use like a team's velocity

00:33:11,970 --> 00:33:16,590
to understand you know predictability

00:33:14,279 --> 00:33:18,419
right if we know a team can consistently

00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:21,269
deliver X amount of points for iteration

00:33:18,419 --> 00:33:22,619
that helps us with our obviously even

00:33:21,269 --> 00:33:25,230
our high-level plan but also our

00:33:22,619 --> 00:33:27,629
detailed planning and then defects as

00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:29,730
well helps us really sort of control the

00:33:27,629 --> 00:33:31,289
the quality that that's happening in the

00:33:29,730 --> 00:33:32,669
iteration you know the other thing I

00:33:31,289 --> 00:33:35,340
want to mention on this is that this is

00:33:32,669 --> 00:33:38,269
kind of all that we track you know we

00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:41,609
don't get into a lot of really fancy

00:33:38,269 --> 00:33:45,059
spreadsheets and you know diagrams and

00:33:41,609 --> 00:33:47,009
whatever keep it simple is sort of our

00:33:45,059 --> 00:33:48,690
motto you know just enough these are the

00:33:47,009 --> 00:33:50,580
metrics we need now these are the

00:33:48,690 --> 00:33:53,999
metrics we need today and so that's

00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:55,559
really what we're tracking I totally

00:33:53,999 --> 00:33:57,679
shouldn't I keep it simple slide yeah

00:33:55,559 --> 00:34:00,659
well just make sure you spell it right

00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:01,889
so ultimately we're delivering what we

00:34:00,659 --> 00:34:03,480
said we were going to deliver at the end

00:34:01,889 --> 00:34:05,460
of the project which actually we're not

00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:06,779
quite at the end of NBC com but this is

00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:08,159
pretty close to what you know something

00:34:06,779 --> 00:34:11,069
close to what it might look like in the

00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:13,139
future but the fact is delivered doesn't

00:34:11,069 --> 00:34:14,909
mean done and so this is part of the

00:34:13,139 --> 00:34:16,589
process that we want to make sure so you

00:34:14,909 --> 00:34:18,089
know once again we're at a large company

00:34:16,589 --> 00:34:20,220
we're delivering value not just a

00:34:18,089 --> 00:34:22,020
product at the end so once we've

00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:23,970
delivered this the next part of the

00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:26,040
process actually begins which is

00:34:23,970 --> 00:34:27,569
measuring our benefit and support and we

00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:29,579
often forget that that even though the

00:34:27,569 --> 00:34:32,099
development phase might be over and the

00:34:29,579 --> 00:34:33,780
team might be rolling off of this the

00:34:32,099 --> 00:34:35,429
business is still obviously very much

00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:37,349
involved we're now delivering something

00:34:35,429 --> 00:34:39,750
once this goes in front of our audience

00:34:37,349 --> 00:34:41,220
once people start using this we're going

00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:43,049
to have to start measuring whether or

00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:44,819
not we're achieving the goals we set for

00:34:43,049 --> 00:34:47,190
this so this goes back to the vision our

00:34:44,819 --> 00:34:49,559
vision usually includes some of the

00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:51,540
goals we've set for this this redesign

00:34:49,559 --> 00:34:53,250
or this project and so basically what

00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:55,409
we're saying is this once we move to new

00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:57,420
platform we want people to do this more

00:34:55,409 --> 00:34:59,309
or do this glass or go here more or

00:34:57,420 --> 00:35:00,299
experience of this now we get to start

00:34:59,309 --> 00:35:02,099
to measure that so that's really

00:35:00,299 --> 00:35:03,720
important for us we're measuring the

00:35:02,099 --> 00:35:05,339
benefits of once again the business is

00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:07,829
looking to see if they're getting out of

00:35:05,339 --> 00:35:09,630
this what they expected once again if

00:35:07,829 --> 00:35:11,460
we're already in production if we're

00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:12,720
delivering every two weeks we can track

00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:14,160
this all of the time

00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:15,540
tracking functionality is something

00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:17,640
inherent and support making sure things

00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:20,670
are working we start gathering feedback

00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:22,550
again because now people are using it so

00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:25,250
we're getting something out of it and

00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:28,099
creating user stories so we're back to

00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:30,359
the backlog Korea and each one of the

00:35:28,099 --> 00:35:32,130
projects that we work on for each one of

00:35:30,359 --> 00:35:34,380
the brands have their own backlog by

00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:36,030
core team has a backlog as well and

00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:38,070
they're all influenced by each other and

00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:40,380
the point is and the reason why we have

00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:42,210
that slide titled not done is that at

00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:44,130
the end of the project we want to re

00:35:42,210 --> 00:35:46,440
groom our backlog and take another look

00:35:44,130 --> 00:35:48,240
at it and sort of start again and make

00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:50,310
sure that we're in a good place to

00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:52,020
deliver more value to each of the brands

00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:54,030
that are using the product and more

00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:55,560
about value to those brands themselves

00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:57,119
you know it's interesting because that

00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:58,740
you know I'm and I'm in charge of the

00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:00,359
projects and actually implementing them

00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:02,160
but that's really sort of the beginning

00:36:00,359 --> 00:36:03,690
right at the end of a project is really

00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:06,500
the beginning right so now we have a

00:36:03,690 --> 00:36:08,940
community right we have a community of

00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:10,590
internal developers you know some of the

00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:12,750
brands have their own smaller teams that

00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:15,210
they use we have an internal community

00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:17,550
of end-users and now we have a community

00:36:15,210 --> 00:36:19,320
of you know of visitors out there that

00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:21,060
are all using the same platform so

00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:22,950
really at the end of the day this is the

00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:27,540
beginning and now we're really all part

00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:30,540
of a larger group which is exciting yeah

00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:32,070
so to summarize I think what's what's

00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:33,839
the message we're trying to get across

00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:35,820
to you today is really that this process

00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:38,520
although it is complex it's really

00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:41,010
designed to deliver on these five areas

00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:42,930
which is a scalable platform in in the

00:36:41,010 --> 00:36:45,000
form of our publisher product that

00:36:42,930 --> 00:36:47,339
delivers common functionality to all of

00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:50,040
our brands so that these things are

00:36:47,339 --> 00:36:51,390
built once and reused and that's the

00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:53,160
point of the second bullet which is

00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:55,530
reusable parts that come out of the

00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:57,599
publisher core team as well as

00:36:55,530 --> 00:37:00,770
functionality that's built during an

00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:02,970
implementation that could be used for an

00:37:00,770 --> 00:37:05,790
implementation that's built for brand a

00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:07,619
could be used for brand be right so on

00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:09,839
NBC com if they're building something

00:37:07,619 --> 00:37:11,730
that's oxygen could use we want to be

00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:13,890
able to reuse that defining your

00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:15,540
requirements obviously I think we all

00:37:13,890 --> 00:37:17,640
know how important that is we put a

00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:20,010
particular emphasis on requirements in

00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:21,420
our organization mostly because we've

00:37:20,010 --> 00:37:23,099
been doing this a long time and we know

00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:24,559
that without requirements we really

00:37:23,099 --> 00:37:26,809
can't build anything

00:37:24,559 --> 00:37:28,430
we can't project with any certainty when

00:37:26,809 --> 00:37:30,140
something is going to be done which is

00:37:28,430 --> 00:37:32,930
all that you know our brand leaders

00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:34,579
ultimately care about the relationships

00:37:32,930 --> 00:37:36,049
and collaboration obviously we're here

00:37:34,579 --> 00:37:38,869
at drupalcon and we've been coming for

00:37:36,049 --> 00:37:40,729
several years we want to participate not

00:37:38,869 --> 00:37:43,640
only and collaborate not only internally

00:37:40,729 --> 00:37:46,219
within within each team but between

00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:48,289
teams and with our brand leaders as well

00:37:46,219 --> 00:37:49,999
as with editorial personnel throughout

00:37:48,289 --> 00:37:51,920
the company that's a lot of

00:37:49,999 --> 00:37:53,989
collaboration and a lot of communication

00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:56,420
that has to happen but one of the things

00:37:53,989 --> 00:37:58,279
that I've really become fond of is the

00:37:56,420 --> 00:38:01,910
fact that talk is a lot cheaper than

00:37:58,279 --> 00:38:04,099
development so we we put a heavy

00:38:01,910 --> 00:38:06,229
emphasis on that as well and then the

00:38:04,099 --> 00:38:08,839
metrics that Adam mentioned just help us

00:38:06,229 --> 00:38:10,369
refine and improve our process and make

00:38:08,839 --> 00:38:12,049
sure it's sort of like a gut check to

00:38:10,369 --> 00:38:13,939
make sure that we are delivering value

00:38:12,049 --> 00:38:16,249
to each one of our brands and we are

00:38:13,939 --> 00:38:17,689
delivering value to the company if we

00:38:16,249 --> 00:38:19,400
build something once we want to measure

00:38:17,689 --> 00:38:22,219
the effectiveness of that functionality

00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:24,439
by seeing how many times it's used how

00:38:22,219 --> 00:38:26,959
long it took to build and what that

00:38:24,439 --> 00:38:28,400
value really is at the end of the day so

00:38:26,959 --> 00:38:30,979
I think two things are important well

00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:33,319
one most important thing is when we

00:38:30,979 --> 00:38:34,819
started this I don't think which is a

00:38:33,319 --> 00:38:37,069
while ago a couple of years ago we

00:38:34,819 --> 00:38:38,630
started implementing this not everyone

00:38:37,069 --> 00:38:40,420
was buying into it not everyone was sure

00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:42,709
this was going to work and one of the

00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:43,519
gratifying parts of this is now that

00:38:42,709 --> 00:38:45,650
we've been doing it for a while

00:38:43,519 --> 00:38:47,209
especially with new folks that have

00:38:45,650 --> 00:38:48,979
never worked this way before we're

00:38:47,209 --> 00:38:51,529
getting a lot of satisfied customers

00:38:48,979 --> 00:38:52,969
they're telling us that they appreciate

00:38:51,529 --> 00:38:54,170
the way we're doing things that it's a

00:38:52,969 --> 00:38:55,579
little more painful in the beginning and

00:38:54,170 --> 00:38:58,219
usually we're getting a little push back

00:38:55,579 --> 00:39:00,019
at the beginning but we're really

00:38:58,219 --> 00:39:01,729
pushing them a little bit more than they

00:39:00,019 --> 00:39:03,199
may have been pushed in the past they're

00:39:01,729 --> 00:39:04,579
getting good results out of it and

00:39:03,199 --> 00:39:06,619
really ultimately it's getting the

00:39:04,579 --> 00:39:08,089
result we're looking for you know a lot

00:39:06,619 --> 00:39:09,589
of this revolves around estimating and

00:39:08,089 --> 00:39:12,199
planning and really having a good

00:39:09,589 --> 00:39:13,369
process place to do that so actually

00:39:12,199 --> 00:39:14,929
just to mention that James night

00:39:13,369 --> 00:39:17,650
tomorrow total plug and coming out

00:39:14,929 --> 00:39:19,579
tomorrow James and I are holding ab off

00:39:17,650 --> 00:39:21,109
just to talk about estimating and

00:39:19,579 --> 00:39:22,339
planning we could talk about what we're

00:39:21,109 --> 00:39:23,660
doing but we'd also like to hear what

00:39:22,339 --> 00:39:25,369
other people do it because that's really

00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:27,410
one of the biggest challenges that we

00:39:25,369 --> 00:39:29,359
have is really refining and getting

00:39:27,410 --> 00:39:34,339
better estimating and planning so please

00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:36,969
come to that and that's it for today

00:39:34,339 --> 00:39:36,969
we'll take questions

00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:48,530
so go ahead so we try to use simple

00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:50,900
tools we're using rally mostly for

00:39:48,530 --> 00:39:54,580
managing our iterations and managing our

00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:56,990
requirements we're trying to use it too

00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:58,460
we also use it for our metrics as well

00:39:56,990 --> 00:40:00,500
we're trying to use it for some of our

00:39:58,460 --> 00:40:02,150
sort of pre-planning but it doesn't

00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:04,970
really do a good job so we're really

00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:06,890
using homemade custom spreadsheets at

00:40:04,970 --> 00:40:09,470
this point yeah there just aren't tools

00:40:06,890 --> 00:40:11,150
out there but you know once we develop

00:40:09,470 --> 00:40:13,070
them I think rallies a little bit better

00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:17,740
on the product side for release planning

00:40:13,070 --> 00:40:17,740
but not on the implementation side yeah

00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:21,040
sure

00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:27,580
can everyone here because we could

00:40:25,830 --> 00:40:29,710
repeat the question you know actually

00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:31,330
that Mike we could pass around yeah the

00:40:29,710 --> 00:40:33,040
question was how big is the core team

00:40:31,330 --> 00:40:36,250
and how long did it take to release the

00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:38,440
initial version the core team now is

00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:43,110
about 20 people and that's all in that's

00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:47,080
requirements dev QA product people

00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:49,720
project management as well and it took

00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:52,720
really before this the product was ready

00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:56,800
for the first site to build on top of it

00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:58,060
took close to a year and that was there

00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:59,890
was a little bit of faith that this

00:40:58,060 --> 00:41:01,720
company certainly gave us to build that

00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:03,580
core product but by using this process

00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:06,610
that we've been talking about today to

00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:08,140
build the product itself there was a lot

00:41:06,610 --> 00:41:10,000
of trust that was gained through

00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:12,370
predictability we didn't start that

00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:16,150
large either a little bit was probably

00:41:12,370 --> 00:41:18,520
about 10 or 12 in the beginning but then

00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:20,200
because we had some good metrics we were

00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:21,640
able to project that we probably needed

00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:23,740
a little bit more help in order to

00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:29,260
leverage it for all brands which was the

00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:33,760
goal all other questions Sherman over

00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:35,940
here okay oh please we'll get to you

00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,940
next

00:42:02,190 --> 00:42:07,150
excellent question so the question was

00:42:04,869 --> 00:42:08,589
you know for measuring velocity and we

00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:11,349
have so much pressure from the brand

00:42:08,589 --> 00:42:14,140
leaders how do we handle that

00:42:11,349 --> 00:42:15,730
communication and that pressure yeah you

00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:17,800
know to me I feel like we handle it

00:42:15,730 --> 00:42:19,869
through transparency we don't push back

00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:22,119
we let them make those decisions we're

00:42:19,869 --> 00:42:23,740
just very transparent about what the

00:42:22,119 --> 00:42:26,020
velocity is of the team what we think

00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:28,960
they can deliver in a certain period of

00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:30,579
time and let those brand leaders make

00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:32,290
those decisions themselves we don't want

00:42:30,579 --> 00:42:33,940
to force that force their hand in any

00:42:32,290 --> 00:42:35,140
way and what that's the best method

00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:37,630
quick whatever thing yeah when it works

00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:39,099
well the brand's our partners make those

00:42:37,630 --> 00:42:41,560
decisions so we had before they even

00:42:39,099 --> 00:42:43,570
come up actually so we had on this very

00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:45,640
project nbc.com and we started with the

00:42:43,570 --> 00:42:47,560
scope of the project we knew that there

00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:49,270
that there were things that we knew the

00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:50,470
realities go they were just too big for

00:42:49,270 --> 00:42:51,339
us to happen well I don't know if we

00:42:50,470 --> 00:42:52,750
thought they were crazy but we knew that

00:42:51,339 --> 00:42:54,550
they probably bigger than what we can

00:42:52,750 --> 00:42:57,220
handle even at the beginning we had an

00:42:54,550 --> 00:42:58,540
idea and oh but but the partner to their

00:42:57,220 --> 00:43:00,609
credit said no we want to keep them in

00:42:58,540 --> 00:43:02,349
we we understand we hear you we may not

00:43:00,609 --> 00:43:04,359
believe you right which is fine they're

00:43:02,349 --> 00:43:06,700
really running their product they're the

00:43:04,359 --> 00:43:08,770
business but over time when we were

00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:10,390
delivering consistently they saw that

00:43:08,770 --> 00:43:12,130
what they were getting good quality they

00:43:10,390 --> 00:43:13,270
saw that we were legitimately working as

00:43:12,130 --> 00:43:16,300
hard as we could we were delivering

00:43:13,270 --> 00:43:17,829
maximum amount of stuff they started to

00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:19,660
realize for themselves that we weren't

00:43:17,829 --> 00:43:21,490
going to get all of these thing and that

00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:23,260
it was true right and what we were said

00:43:21,490 --> 00:43:25,569
and they literally took out everything

00:43:23,260 --> 00:43:27,069
we had said probably should have be

00:43:25,569 --> 00:43:28,450
taken out in the beginning but they at

00:43:27,069 --> 00:43:29,589
that point realized it for themselves is

00:43:28,450 --> 00:43:31,359
very helpful to us when they do that

00:43:29,589 --> 00:43:33,670
they also knew that we could add some

00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:36,369
another team which we to add capacity

00:43:33,670 --> 00:43:38,200
that's always a possibility but the fact

00:43:36,369 --> 00:43:40,420
is you York install ways constrained by

00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:42,099
something and so the constraint is

00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:43,750
either the amount of things we can do or

00:43:42,099 --> 00:43:45,069
add more people to do it which adds to

00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:46,589
complexity which doesn't mean you're

00:43:45,069 --> 00:43:48,609
going to get everything still so

00:43:46,589 --> 00:43:50,440
ultimately we're just being very

00:43:48,609 --> 00:43:53,500
transparent about what's real reality is

00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:54,190
is the killer here because traditionally

00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:56,290
people are

00:43:54,190 --> 00:43:57,640
are led to believe they're going to get

00:43:56,290 --> 00:43:59,500
everything or there have been yes to

00:43:57,640 --> 00:44:00,550
death oh yeah no problem will get it for

00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:01,870
you oh no that's not gonna be a problem

00:44:00,550 --> 00:44:03,850
one they don't it's quite a

00:44:01,870 --> 00:44:05,380
disappointment and rightly so what we're

00:44:03,850 --> 00:44:06,850
saying look we're going to give you

00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:08,200
everything we can give you and we want

00:44:06,850 --> 00:44:09,940
to make sure we do the important things

00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:11,530
first which is by the way also a

00:44:09,940 --> 00:44:12,910
different way of doing things people

00:44:11,530 --> 00:44:16,000
aren't used to having to make choices

00:44:12,910 --> 00:44:17,320
even though they they should be right so

00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,630
there's always a finite amount of time

00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:21,070
or capacity or something yet in the past

00:44:19,630 --> 00:44:22,300
people have just for some reason felt

00:44:21,070 --> 00:44:23,770
well we're just gonna get everything at

00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:25,270
some point we're not going to get

00:44:23,770 --> 00:44:26,590
everything at some point and so we're

00:44:25,270 --> 00:44:28,180
being realistic about that up front

00:44:26,590 --> 00:44:29,770
it'sit's uncomfortable in the beginning

00:44:28,180 --> 00:44:31,300
for some of these folks that haven't

00:44:29,770 --> 00:44:34,240
worked with us in the past or haven't

00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:36,280
worked this way ever but ultimately over

00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:38,890
time I feel like that uncomfortability

00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:40,960
goes away yeah it's also you know about

00:44:38,890 --> 00:44:43,060
breaking things down even further nine

00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:44,680
times out of ten something that is big

00:44:43,060 --> 00:44:46,750
the team will come back and say wow

00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:48,580
that's pretty complex as we break it

00:44:46,750 --> 00:44:50,950
down we can have additional discussions

00:44:48,580 --> 00:44:52,840
and that goes really a long way so if

00:44:50,950 --> 00:44:54,310
the things seem too big where they want

00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:55,720
to get more work in a lot of times we

00:44:54,310 --> 00:44:57,430
break things down a little bit further

00:44:55,720 --> 00:45:05,800
and we find out that they're a little

00:44:57,430 --> 00:45:10,450
bit more digestible to the velocity is

00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:12,460
the is the result of the team so it's

00:45:10,450 --> 00:45:15,400
not something that we control it's a

00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:17,770
metric that tells us about

00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:19,960
predictability right and so we can

00:45:17,770 --> 00:45:22,030
actually if you know in that slide what

00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:25,560
you'll see sort of some tips and things

00:45:22,030 --> 00:45:27,640
like that i can tell you you know almost

00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:30,100
you know there's there's reasons behind

00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:33,210
everything the 131 we had some vacations

00:45:30,100 --> 00:45:35,410
Dennis I think you were out on vacation

00:45:33,210 --> 00:45:37,990
27 we were still had people on vacation

00:45:35,410 --> 00:45:39,640
so there's reasons why the velocity dips

00:45:37,990 --> 00:45:41,890
but predicting that throughout your

00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:43,920
project gives you the ability to have

00:45:41,890 --> 00:45:48,730
that conversation about prioritization

00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:50,950
scope and you know of that how that goes

00:45:48,730 --> 00:45:52,780
a long way yeah that number is just a

00:45:50,950 --> 00:45:55,420
reflection of the point sizes that they

00:45:52,780 --> 00:45:57,100
were able to deliver not not ours yeah

00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:59,190
and then we have conversations like what

00:45:57,100 --> 00:46:01,260
would second-team how

00:45:59,190 --> 00:46:02,819
that helped us what if we move these

00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:04,200
feature sets into core what if we

00:46:02,819 --> 00:46:06,240
leverage something that somebody else

00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:07,859
used you know to start really these are

00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:10,619
all conversations that we can have

00:46:07,859 --> 00:46:13,290
rather than hey can't you just have the

00:46:10,619 --> 00:46:14,490
team work faster you know I think I

00:46:13,290 --> 00:46:17,930
heard that one the other day oh yeah

00:46:14,490 --> 00:46:17,930
where I was there a question back here

00:46:27,349 --> 00:46:33,710
we call it James yeah now we need the

00:46:31,770 --> 00:46:36,180
picture of me on the four phones yeah

00:46:33,710 --> 00:46:39,060
any anything and everything I think is

00:46:36,180 --> 00:46:41,310
the answer I mean primarily we do a lot

00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:43,829
of meetings right but for a lot of the

00:46:41,310 --> 00:46:45,960
planning meetings for these projects

00:46:43,829 --> 00:46:48,660
they have to be people have to either be

00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:50,579
in person or online so WebEx and

00:46:48,660 --> 00:46:52,710
teleconference calls we do a lot of that

00:46:50,579 --> 00:46:54,630
for some of our larger projects where

00:46:52,710 --> 00:46:56,700
we're fortunate to be able to use things

00:46:54,630 --> 00:46:59,579
like video conferencing we do that as

00:46:56,700 --> 00:47:01,650
well so anything we can to we really

00:46:59,579 --> 00:47:03,240
want to foster that collaboration as

00:47:01,650 --> 00:47:06,450
much as possible and we're pretty

00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:12,060
religious base camp users yeah and IRC

00:47:06,450 --> 00:47:14,520
as well yep your point of view we

00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:16,710
charter like the skills that you were

00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:18,960
looking at project manager if you were

00:47:16,710 --> 00:47:22,500
hiring someone here for organizational

00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:24,300
fits your dermatology and what really

00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:26,910
matters for you because what project

00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:28,619
manager might have so many skills yeah

00:47:26,910 --> 00:47:31,290
that's a good question what three are

00:47:28,619 --> 00:47:32,670
the ones that really matter I think

00:47:31,290 --> 00:47:35,089
first of all it's somebody who's done

00:47:32,670 --> 00:47:38,160
this before so done some level of agile

00:47:35,089 --> 00:47:40,740
but hopefully it's somebody who sort of

00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:42,329
done it obviously successfully but

00:47:40,740 --> 00:47:44,339
really with kind of a team that was

00:47:42,329 --> 00:47:46,349
co-located because we're not co-located

00:47:44,339 --> 00:47:48,540
we have teams all around the world but

00:47:46,349 --> 00:47:50,849
having that as a reference point for a

00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:52,619
project manager and what they're driving

00:47:50,849 --> 00:47:54,900
towards is really important having that

00:47:52,619 --> 00:47:56,490
vision of like you know this is what the

00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:58,230
team should look like even though I may

00:47:56,490 --> 00:48:00,359
never get there this is how we should be

00:47:58,230 --> 00:48:04,650
operating and constantly driving so

00:48:00,359 --> 00:48:06,720
experience with with agile and but

00:48:04,650 --> 00:48:08,069
flexible enough to realize that we

00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:09,280
actually stopped calling our process

00:48:08,069 --> 00:48:11,680
agile because everybody has

00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:13,870
agile so we just call it the process the

00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:17,140
process but it's you know it's based on

00:48:13,870 --> 00:48:19,780
sort of scrum and other agile principles

00:48:17,140 --> 00:48:22,030
I think also we look for technical

00:48:19,780 --> 00:48:24,220
project managers so somebody we don't

00:48:22,030 --> 00:48:26,590
need to really dive into code but

00:48:24,220 --> 00:48:29,920
somebody who really understands when a

00:48:26,590 --> 00:48:32,620
developer says I have this block I need

00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:34,330
it removed like you want to understand

00:48:32,620 --> 00:48:36,010
the severity of that right and you may

00:48:34,330 --> 00:48:38,710
need to be able to talk to other teams

00:48:36,010 --> 00:48:40,360
in some cases and go to you know talk to

00:48:38,710 --> 00:48:42,100
the architects on other teams and say

00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:43,840
hey listen you know we've got this

00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:45,190
problem you know so you need you need

00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:48,850
you need those skills and really

00:48:45,190 --> 00:48:51,370
somebody who is you know incredibly good

00:48:48,850 --> 00:48:55,380
at communication that's really those

00:48:51,370 --> 00:48:55,380
those would i would say be the top three

00:48:55,530 --> 00:48:58,650
up front

00:49:06,799 --> 00:49:17,250
yes well we our philosophy is it's still

00:49:14,789 --> 00:49:18,809
based on the principles about if you if

00:49:17,250 --> 00:49:20,160
you've done scrum you'll recognize what

00:49:18,809 --> 00:49:22,680
we're doing it's not a completely

00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:25,500
different thing we use much of the

00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:27,480
language of scrum lean and konban a lot

00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:29,970
basically it's scrum lame you know very

00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:31,349
lean thinking in con bond so it's it's

00:49:29,970 --> 00:49:33,390
not like there's no lexicon for what

00:49:31,349 --> 00:49:35,369
we're doing but in reality what we felt

00:49:33,390 --> 00:49:37,079
and James and I've been doing actual

00:49:35,369 --> 00:49:40,500
agile implementations for a while is

00:49:37,079 --> 00:49:42,599
that we we wanted to make a process that

00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:44,640
fit in the organization so our

00:49:42,599 --> 00:49:46,380
organization this process would work

00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:47,549
pretty much everywhere but it might be

00:49:46,380 --> 00:49:49,769
tweaked again for a different type of

00:49:47,549 --> 00:49:51,990
organization so what we've done is fit

00:49:49,769 --> 00:49:53,700
things to work agile II within an

00:49:51,990 --> 00:49:56,549
organization that isn't necessarily all

00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:58,259
agile and nor really understands agility

00:49:56,549 --> 00:50:00,509
at all levels so just now we're starting

00:49:58,259 --> 00:50:02,130
to interface with upper management and

00:50:00,509 --> 00:50:03,839
understanding maybe we can actually help

00:50:02,130 --> 00:50:05,099
them project and do budgeting with some

00:50:03,839 --> 00:50:06,390
of the numbers we're having because

00:50:05,099 --> 00:50:09,029
we're getting that consistent of things

00:50:06,390 --> 00:50:11,099
where most years at most places will

00:50:09,029 --> 00:50:13,289
just you know do their usual yearly

00:50:11,099 --> 00:50:15,420
guess for the next year's budget so

00:50:13,289 --> 00:50:16,950
we're just applying things but what we

00:50:15,420 --> 00:50:18,539
found over the years just from our agile

00:50:16,950 --> 00:50:20,460
experience and I've been doing agile

00:50:18,539 --> 00:50:23,339
before scrum rights it before even scrum

00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:25,140
was from that one methodology doesn't

00:50:23,339 --> 00:50:27,029
necessarily scale or fit all of our

00:50:25,140 --> 00:50:29,160
needs and so we don't want to be not

00:50:27,029 --> 00:50:31,890
agile but we want to find what's maybe a

00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:33,180
best of methodology that fits in we what

00:50:31,890 --> 00:50:35,519
I like to tell people is I know when

00:50:33,180 --> 00:50:37,079
it's not agile right and that's what we

00:50:35,519 --> 00:50:38,640
really want to do and part of what we're

00:50:37,079 --> 00:50:40,769
responsible for also is training people

00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:42,750
on the so we actually do a three day

00:50:40,769 --> 00:50:44,339
training course at the beginning that is

00:50:42,750 --> 00:50:46,200
so everyone's starting from the same

00:50:44,339 --> 00:50:48,119
place and the reality is that scrum and

00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:49,740
agile don't do a good job describing how

00:50:48,119 --> 00:50:51,720
you work with global teams they just say

00:50:49,740 --> 00:50:54,839
you don't do it right but the reality is

00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:57,150
we do and I think we're successful in

00:50:54,839 --> 00:50:59,640
that and so we I wouldn't say that we've

00:50:57,150 --> 00:51:01,759
changed it we really take that and it's

00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:04,440
it's more of a broader sort of process

00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:06,720
that goes into more detail into things

00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:08,400
like this is how you write a requirement

00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:10,740
this is the type of meetings that you

00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:12,110
have this is how you work with global

00:51:10,740 --> 00:51:13,610
teams etc this is how

00:51:12,110 --> 00:51:15,200
you work across two teams these are

00:51:13,610 --> 00:51:17,690
things that really the agile community

00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:19,220
hasn't defined and things that people

00:51:17,690 --> 00:51:20,540
are struggling with and really if you

00:51:19,220 --> 00:51:23,000
think about scrum and most people are

00:51:20,540 --> 00:51:24,500
familiar with scrum depending on who you

00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:26,120
speak with and some of the founders of

00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:28,760
scrum and they've changed their point of

00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:30,260
view over time as well they some of them

00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:32,060
say well we didn't say these things but

00:51:30,260 --> 00:51:33,980
we didn't mean that you ignore them like

00:51:32,060 --> 00:51:35,750
architecture for instance and some

00:51:33,980 --> 00:51:37,790
people say if it's not in the book scrum

00:51:35,750 --> 00:51:40,460
doesn't do it project management isn't

00:51:37,790 --> 00:51:43,100
part of scrum but project management is

00:51:40,460 --> 00:51:45,410
necessary to in our organization to run

00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:47,570
a successful project so what is how we

00:51:45,410 --> 00:51:49,340
make that an agile thing requirements

00:51:47,570 --> 00:51:51,950
have a standard form which we've learned

00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:53,990
from scrum as a user which we use but we

00:51:51,950 --> 00:51:55,250
we extrapolate take the benefit

00:51:53,990 --> 00:51:57,590
statement and make that a separate line

00:51:55,250 --> 00:51:59,060
so that we can actually force people to

00:51:57,590 --> 00:52:00,650
think through what we're going to

00:51:59,060 --> 00:52:01,970
measure later so it's not mixed in with

00:52:00,650 --> 00:52:03,560
something it separate so we've just

00:52:01,970 --> 00:52:05,030
tweaked it a little bit to kind of

00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:23,600
highlight what we think is important in

00:52:05,030 --> 00:52:28,370
the process you want to try that one you

00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:30,980
don't know but and so I I think that

00:52:28,370 --> 00:52:33,320
we're trying basically to implement this

00:52:30,980 --> 00:52:34,940
idea of business value now so we haven't

00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:36,860
been doing it for a very long time we're

00:52:34,940 --> 00:52:39,320
just at the point so what's great about

00:52:36,860 --> 00:52:41,270
our process is it's evolved as since

00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:42,830
we've been there and the focus on

00:52:41,270 --> 00:52:44,570
business value is actually something

00:52:42,830 --> 00:52:46,670
that's organically happening within the

00:52:44,570 --> 00:52:48,380
organization so we're actually now

00:52:46,670 --> 00:52:50,420
starting to focus more about what it

00:52:48,380 --> 00:52:51,500
really means to have business value what

00:52:50,420 --> 00:52:53,600
it is we're going to measure so we

00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:55,520
actually use the semantics of a benefit

00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:58,460
is something that you can actually

00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:59,810
measure a trend or see so if i have i'll

00:52:58,460 --> 00:53:01,910
start with the value a value is a

00:52:59,810 --> 00:53:04,850
definitive number so if i have the goal

00:53:01,910 --> 00:53:07,370
of increasing X by ten percent or user

00:53:04,850 --> 00:53:09,200
or advertising revenue decreasing

00:53:07,370 --> 00:53:11,030
something by a number 10 million 100

00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:12,500
million that's a value that we can

00:53:11,030 --> 00:53:14,270
measure so every iteration we can

00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:15,620
measure to see if what we're doing is

00:53:14,270 --> 00:53:17,870
actually working within the organization

00:53:15,620 --> 00:53:20,270
a benefit is is less measurable it's

00:53:17,870 --> 00:53:22,190
more like I want people to watch more

00:53:20,270 --> 00:53:24,230
videos I want people to go to this page

00:53:22,190 --> 00:53:25,550
more so the first thing we're doing is

00:53:24,230 --> 00:53:27,050
introducing the difference between

00:53:25,550 --> 00:53:28,880
value and a benefit to the organization

00:53:27,050 --> 00:53:31,400
and now we're actually just starting to

00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:33,140
look at how our partners are measuring

00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:35,030
things so they can actually take

00:53:33,140 --> 00:53:36,350
advantage of this so these are numbers

00:53:35,030 --> 00:53:38,390
that was just starting to introduce

00:53:36,350 --> 00:53:40,160
because not that they weren't important

00:53:38,390 --> 00:53:41,960
before but people weren't using them and

00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:44,120
so this is something that's actually

00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:46,310
knew in our organization especially

00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:48,080
since we're able now people are buying

00:53:46,310 --> 00:53:49,430
into the process so they're buying into

00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:50,990
some of the results of the problem and I

00:53:49,430 --> 00:53:53,840
think the value is a little bit easier

00:53:50,990 --> 00:53:55,640
to measure on the product side to a

00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:57,500
certain degree because you could say you

00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:59,330
know did this save the editor time in

00:53:57,500 --> 00:54:01,700
publishing this type of content or did

00:53:59,330 --> 00:54:04,300
it you know was it reused on a number of

00:54:01,700 --> 00:54:06,590
different sites without any added

00:54:04,300 --> 00:54:08,210
development time right so that's a value

00:54:06,590 --> 00:54:11,510
that can be measured but we don't have a

00:54:08,210 --> 00:54:13,790
lot of control over the performance of a

00:54:11,510 --> 00:54:15,830
website in terms of monetary performance

00:54:13,790 --> 00:54:17,990
or traffic right that's all a very

00:54:15,830 --> 00:54:19,640
complex thing that we don't control but

00:54:17,990 --> 00:54:21,770
we can start to measure against that and

00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:23,480
we want our partners who do control it

00:54:21,770 --> 00:54:24,770
or have more control over it to really

00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:26,110
start thinking about it so when we say

00:54:24,770 --> 00:54:28,520
something is not done from our

00:54:26,110 --> 00:54:30,410
organizational point of view once our

00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:32,750
thing is delivered we are kind of done

00:54:30,410 --> 00:54:34,280
but we want them to know that there's

00:54:32,750 --> 00:54:35,690
something more that these metrics are

00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:37,790
important so we're building that into

00:54:35,690 --> 00:54:39,560
the culture of the company more than we

00:54:37,790 --> 00:54:41,870
so it's a great question I hope next

00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:46,360
year I have an actual definitive answer

00:54:41,870 --> 00:54:46,360
with results for you and in Formula I

00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:50,770
think we got time for one more sure

00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:04,760
how do you guys work

00:55:04,839 --> 00:55:10,180
so at the at the task level where it's

00:55:08,019 --> 00:55:12,910
really at this point we have the stories

00:55:10,180 --> 00:55:15,009
the requirements broken down and it's

00:55:12,910 --> 00:55:16,539
really you know how much time am I going

00:55:15,009 --> 00:55:18,400
to spend on that and yeah it's it's a

00:55:16,539 --> 00:55:21,880
little bit of group effort in some cases

00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:23,609
will have sort of a lead work with some

00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:26,979
of the other people that are more junior

00:55:23,609 --> 00:55:29,049
to sort of you know share their

00:55:26,979 --> 00:55:30,219
experiences and say yeah I think this

00:55:29,049 --> 00:55:33,009
will probably take you this amount of

00:55:30,219 --> 00:55:35,019
time but the but the important thing is

00:55:33,009 --> 00:55:36,759
that they're having a conversation about

00:55:35,019 --> 00:55:39,069
it and that you know you can't just sit

00:55:36,759 --> 00:55:41,769
down and say oh I'm going to build this

00:55:39,069 --> 00:55:43,719
module I think I need this task in that

00:55:41,769 --> 00:55:46,150
task and that it's really about a

00:55:43,719 --> 00:55:47,499
conversation that you're having over and

00:55:46,150 --> 00:55:49,630
over and over again first with your

00:55:47,499 --> 00:55:50,920
product and requirements team and then

00:55:49,630 --> 00:55:52,839
with your peers on the on the

00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:55,089
development side to really understand

00:55:52,839 --> 00:55:56,410
what that is and at the end what we get

00:55:55,089 --> 00:55:58,210
is that on that first day of the

00:55:56,410 --> 00:56:01,029
iteration people are sitting down and

00:55:58,210 --> 00:56:02,049
writing code instead of like sort of you

00:56:01,029 --> 00:56:04,029
know spending a lot of time thinking

00:56:02,049 --> 00:56:05,619
about and dreaming about what this

00:56:04,029 --> 00:56:07,150
module could be because we've already

00:56:05,619 --> 00:56:09,670
done that we've done that ahead of time

00:56:07,150 --> 00:56:12,160
so yeah and the whole team has to agree

00:56:09,670 --> 00:56:13,989
on that on that number right that's size

00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:24,759
including the testers who have to test

00:56:13,989 --> 00:56:27,640
it so that's actually interesting that

00:56:24,759 --> 00:56:29,499
so the leads are kind of in a some of

00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:32,229
them certainly participate more in the

00:56:29,499 --> 00:56:33,460
iteration than others it really depends

00:56:32,229 --> 00:56:35,019
on the team size some of them are

00:56:33,460 --> 00:56:36,880
literally coding and in the team and

00:56:35,019 --> 00:56:40,719
some of them are more mentors dealing

00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:42,430
with upgrades to core dealing with you

00:56:40,719 --> 00:56:44,829
know planning and architecting and

00:56:42,430 --> 00:56:47,529
figure out what modules we're going to

00:56:44,829 --> 00:56:49,479
use and so for their time we're not

00:56:47,529 --> 00:56:52,299
really interested we don't really track

00:56:49,479 --> 00:56:53,529
that necessarily in the iteration when

00:56:52,299 --> 00:56:55,119
we're tracking our tasks in the

00:56:53,529 --> 00:56:56,829
iteration what we're really trying to

00:56:55,119 --> 00:56:59,440
figure out is how are we going to get

00:56:56,829 --> 00:57:00,609
this work done given you know all the

00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:02,650
tests that we have to complete and

00:57:00,609 --> 00:57:04,779
what's our path to do that including

00:57:02,650 --> 00:57:07,029
testing so it really helps us do more

00:57:04,779 --> 00:57:09,609
like plan out two weeks so and then the

00:57:07,029 --> 00:57:10,420
leads we really sort of just over work

00:57:09,609 --> 00:57:16,780
them to death

00:57:10,420 --> 00:57:19,950
you know well thank you everybody thank

00:57:16,780 --> 00:57:19,950
