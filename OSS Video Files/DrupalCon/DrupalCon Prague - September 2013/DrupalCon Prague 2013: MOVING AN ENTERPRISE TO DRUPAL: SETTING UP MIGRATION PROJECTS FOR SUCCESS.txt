Title: DrupalCon Prague 2013: MOVING AN ENTERPRISE TO DRUPAL: SETTING UP MIGRATION PROJECTS FOR SUCCESS
Publication date: 2013-09-26
Playlist: DrupalCon Prague - September 2013
Description: 
	In this session you will learn how one group within NBCUniversal, one of the world's largest media and entertainment companies (http://www.nbcuni.com/corporate/about-us/), leads the interaction with NBCU Brands (Syfy, NBC.com, NBC News, universal Studios, Bravo, Oxygen, Telemundo, etc.) to plan and execute successful enterprise-level site migrations to a centrally-devloped Drupal platform.

Creating a successful path for migrating from platform to platform can be a challenge - creating this path in a large enterprise organization with multiple partners, each with very strong brand identities, is a much greater challenge. In this session we will discuss how we plan and manage the complex interactions with our brand partners to ensure success - the methods and tools we use to mitigate risk; empower our developers; and leverage the Drupal community to further enhance our platform and overall goals at NBCUniversal.

Presenters are:
* Adam Asch, Director, Program Operations, NBCUniversal; adzuki3 on drupal.org; @adamasch
* Chris Herring, Director, Publishing Products & Services; cherringland on drupal.org; @cherringland
* James Kutz, Implementation Manager, Product Operations; jckutz on drupal.org; @jckutz
