Title: DrupalCon Prague 2013: D8 LESSONS LEARNED AND HOW WE CAN MAKE D9 BETTER
Publication date: 2013-09-26
Playlist: DrupalCon Prague - September 2013
Description: 
	After over a year of "project managing" Drupal 8, I've learned a lot with some fellow PM's who support me on a weekly basis. I've also started having retrospectives with the team, so it's great to get their direct feedback and share common trends on these projects.

This proposal is essentially a post-mortem for core development from a non-technical perspective. I'd like to share with you my experiences, both good and bad, and ways I think we could do better.

Some basic problems we'll cover are:

- Community disinterest in project management, difficulties we face in planning and organization ("I don't have time", "I don't know where to begin" etc)
- Problems around managing volunteer projects (unreliable deadlines, plannings that aren't, resource issues)
- Problems around managing core projects (lack of visibility into issues, unpredictability and sheer size of the beast)

I also have a vision of how I'd like to see Drupal 9 core development change, and resources are a big part of that. We have a ladder of expertise to climb in order to build and foster adoption of our Drupal releases, and we're missing key rungs.

I hope to share with you my ideas about:

- What we are doing now to solve the build & upgrade issue (how to get people to build & use the next version)
- How we coule organize teams to maximize support for core development
- What we need to build those teams

I think it's an ideal time to brainstorm with people in the room as well during Q&A to make the most of the time as a group.

PS: this will not be exactly the same presentation that was done in Portland, it'll be updated with new information, theories, ideas and concerns :)

alright so we're gonna get started with

00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:08,910
d eight lessons learned and how it can

00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,230
make Drupal 8 or 9 better I don't know

00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:13,740
why I can't see the title my own session

00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:17,250
it's special so basically what we want

00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:19,289
to do today is get to know each other a

00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:22,050

00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:27,090
invite you all to disagree with me to

00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:28,890
share your comments this is a real

00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:31,890
conversation this is not Shannon

00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:34,500
presenting how things should go that's

00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:37,020

programs with them right now the first

00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:53,969
one is technology partnerships so we

00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,860
have a ton of really cool modules and a

00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:58,410
ton of really cool technology things

00:00:55,860 --> 00:01:00,750
that we're creating to integrate into

00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:02,969
Drupal commerce and i highly recommend

so the other things that we are going to

00:01:56,070 --> 00:02:00,450
talk about so basically why do we care

00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:02,820
about all this crap what are we talking

00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:05,490
about what are we dealing with how is

00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:07,350
Drupal 8 working right now what are the

00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:11,160
things that we like what don't we like

00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:12,989
and obviously I'm inviting you to you

00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:14,420

00:02:12,989 --> 00:02:16,680
you want to

00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:18,660
what are we supposed to do about it I

00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:21,030
think is the real question that I want

00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:22,530
to discuss with you guys today like what

00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:25,710
are our options how can we make this

00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:27,060
better what can we change and finally

00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:28,770
what difference might that make and then

00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:30,120
what other ideas do you have because I'm

00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:32,400
going to put some ideas out to you but I

00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:35,820
also really really want your feedback if

00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,140
you have ideas on you know core that you

00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:40,050
think should be implemented let's talk

00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:44,310
about them so what won't we talk about

00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:46,410
your specific technical beef like I hate

00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:47,880
the lame panels does this I'm sorry can

00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:50,070
you just take that to sprint on Friday

00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:53,340
and go fix it go do something about it

00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:54,630
that's what that's for um I'm putting up

00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:56,400
a slide at the end that'll give you all

00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:58,830
that information just say that little

00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,710
beef inside you take it pack it up bring

00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:05,580
it to friday and go do something um so

00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:07,740
why are you here basically I have to

00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:11,280
answer this question right now no it is

00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:12,870
not too soon imes I I feel sad that

00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,580
people are like why don't you talk about

00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:16,800
triple 9 jibreel a it's not even like

00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:19,590
out yeah like why are you doing this

00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:21,030
because we live in procrastination land

00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:22,680
everyone's still building Drupal 8

00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:25,590
nobody's thinking about how we're

00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:28,500
supposed to do the next one and well

00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:30,240
Larry just raises hand he is so what we

00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,950
need to do is focus on what we can

00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:34,470
change while we can still change it this

00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:36,360
is the time right now when we can make

00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:38,550
these decisions and actually do

00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:40,500
something about it that's why I want to

00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:42,030
have this conversation so we started

00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:44,610
talking about this actually before

00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:45,930
Munich but in Munich a bunch of us were

00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:48,180
sending the lobby for like five hours

00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:50,130
going o be so cool if we could do this

00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:51,900
and you know addy was there and we were

00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:54,600
talking about ladders and Gabbar was

00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:55,890
there and it felt kind of like this this

00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,390
is a little scary we should be doing

00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:59,490
this now we should be making this happen

00:03:57,390 --> 00:04:02,040
so it's kind of for me like orange alert

00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:03,750
I was like this there's a problem that

00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:05,400
we're not solving we're all aware of it

00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:07,950
but it's not so on fire that we

00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:09,480
shouldn't do something about it Portland

00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:10,890
for me was more of a red alert I was

00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:12,450
kind of like holy crap we should be

00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:14,550
funding we should be doing this people

00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:16,380
should be getting organized and you know

00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:17,880
I should probably help with that but

00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:21,960
then I decided to grow baby and that

00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:24,440
slowed me down a little bit um so now I

00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:28,190
feel like we're at Brown alert

00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:30,020
I mean nobody knows really so aliens huh

00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:31,100
we really need to sit down and think

00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:34,040
about this and I feel like we are

00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:35,930
definitely at you know mr. Roche it's

00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:38,060
has come to visit us he's knocking on

00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:41,120
our door you guys need to really get

00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:43,940
involved now this is the mascot for how

00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:46,280
I feel about what we're doing in court

00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:47,870
development process like there's a lot

00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:50,000
of people doing things but we can

00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:53,840
actually have a conversation into this

00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:56,990
so i made a mascot for us this needs to

00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:58,550
stay in your mind this is how I feel so

00:04:56,990 --> 00:05:00,860
the current status I feel like is you

00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:02,450
know is there a unicorn with james Van

00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:04,670
Der Beek's face crying on it somewhere

00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:05,810
this is how I think we're sitting right

00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:07,670
now there's things that we can do

00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:10,160
because everybody wants to know when the

00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:12,290
release is coming out if you don't want

00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,840
to know you're a weirdo and you need to

00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:16,690
leave basically because everybody wants

00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:19,400
to know when is the release coming out

00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:20,960
um we all want to know what's going on

00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:23,450
what's happening we need a lot more

00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,770
communication some some of you guys have

00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:26,570
been awesome about it others are just

00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:28,400
heads down trying to get stuff done and

00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:31,070
they can't and I totally know how that

00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:33,500
feels people want to know how do I do

00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:35,480
this and I was really psyched to hear

00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:37,400
that drees is going to have a training

00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:38,720
package when this comes out I think that

00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:40,760
is the smartest thing that he has ever

00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,990
done and Bravo that's going to be great

00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:43,360
but people still want to know how do I

00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:45,590
do this then we need to help to do that

00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:49,250
behind all of this stuff having their

00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:52,850
actual human beings who need sleep and

00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:55,100
food and to grow babies so they actually

00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:57,620
need rest and this is a problem it's a

00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:59,450
really huge problem across the board and

00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:02,630
it's a huge source of all kinds of other

00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:04,160
problems notably stability I mean how

00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:05,990
can we plan anything how can we work on

00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:08,900
this stuff if we don't have the human

00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:13,850
being support we're not all robots like

00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:15,740
Larry aka the vest so so we need more

00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:17,750
people we need better organization more

00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:19,370
communication we need infrastructure we

00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:21,740
need funding we need this stuff to

00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:23,270
happen and that's why I'm up here

00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:24,350
talking about this right now and why I'm

00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:26,660
trying to get you guys to talk about

00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:29,930
this right now this needs to be

00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:31,820
discussed because otherwise sharka

00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:34,580
optimist bear shark octopus is going to

00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:36,080
come bite us on the ass we need you know

00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:37,460
to avoid burnout we need to make sure

00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,690
that things get finished when they

00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:40,580
it started we need to make sure the

00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:42,650
things get converted there's a whole

00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:44,180
crap ton of work to be done and without

00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:45,560
that stuff it's going to you know slow

00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:47,030
things down we're not going to know

00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,680
what's going on as well we're going to

00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:50,509
have a harder time learning this stuff I

00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:52,490
mean this is critical that we figure out

00:06:50,509 --> 00:06:54,740
how we want to you know lead these

00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:57,410
initiatives so that we can get stuff

00:06:54,740 --> 00:07:00,080
done so let's talk a little bit about

00:06:57,410 --> 00:07:01,400
how its organized today and then let's

00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:04,280
have a discussion about how it could be

00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:06,530
tomorrow so who's involved right now

00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:08,630
we've got lots of levels of people I

00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:14,240
want to start with people not doing

00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:16,310
anything in Drupal core mmm there we go

00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,270
so those would be the abstainers for me

00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:18,889
these are some people who are using

00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:22,310
Drupal they're like yeah Drupal I love

00:07:18,889 --> 00:07:23,780
it it's awesome yeah they're great we

00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:24,919
love their enthusiasm we love what

00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:27,349
they're doing love that they're using

00:07:24,919 --> 00:07:28,759
Drupal what we really want them to do is

00:07:27,349 --> 00:07:30,889
actually start helping and committing to

00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:32,150
core this is how they're going to make a

00:07:30,889 --> 00:07:33,770
difference but they're not doing it

00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:35,780
right now for reasons which are not

00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:36,830
entirely known to us they need to do

00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:38,690
their thing they need to build their

00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:41,120
sites ok maybe their business is brand

00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:42,710
new they have their reasons but they

00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:47,030
need training and they need to get a

00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:49,190
clue the next level as I see it our

00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:50,599
novices these are people who you know

00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:52,430
have developed with Drupal but don't

00:07:50,599 --> 00:07:54,440
really know what they're doing with core

00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:56,360
they're not you know totally engaged and

00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:58,729
not like yeah quorum and do it because

00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:59,930
it's a scary thing so they kind of are

00:07:58,729 --> 00:08:02,030
sitting there going oh I wish I could

00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:04,639
help that would be cool we're going to

00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:06,139
help you do that so then you have the

00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:07,460
beginners and the beginners are people

00:08:06,139 --> 00:08:08,870
who are starting out with core they're

00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:10,729
they're comfortable doing small things

00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:13,159
but give them like a big task and

00:08:10,729 --> 00:08:15,500
they're like whoa dude I don't know if I

00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:17,630
can do this so they need training and

00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:19,880
they need a lot of support to know where

00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:22,400
to go and what to do mostly they just

00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:25,849
need stuff that they can kind of you

00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:27,680
know sharpen their teeth on finally you

00:08:25,849 --> 00:08:30,259
have the experts I love these people

00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:32,990
they are full of information they've

00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:34,640
worked on core they just need time and

00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:36,709
sometimes directions sometimes they need

00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:39,260
to know where to go to which is why the

00:08:36,709 --> 00:08:43,279
mentors are my heroes I'm giving you a

00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:45,620
love right now so those people you know

00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:47,270
are really involved but they only have

00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:48,190
so much time and so much they can do

00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:49,870
with that time and

00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:52,750
what's really the challenge at that

00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:54,100
level is just finding more people to get

00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:56,560
at that levels that they can get things

00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:59,620
done and finally UV initiative owners

00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:01,270
who are just you know superheroes

00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:03,610
basically they're working their asses

00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:05,290
off they're doing all this stuff they

00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:07,420
can't be everywhere but somehow they are

00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:09,850
guys like bend space and time I don't

00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:11,260
know how you do it so they kind of need

00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:13,120
help all over the place they need

00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:16,690
mentors they need people doing stuff

00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:18,340
they need reviewers so basically the two

00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:19,750
that I feel like will help us the most

00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:21,160
right now are the experts and the

00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:22,690
beginners the people are just getting

00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:25,570
started doing stuff and the people who

00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:27,190
are pretty well you know set up and core

00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:29,740
developments are comfortable doing it

00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:32,530
we're critically missing these two tiers

00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:34,570
of people because beginners are people

00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:36,040
who can become experts an experts are

00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:37,720
people who can train lower levels but

00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:39,970
beginners can also train lower levels

00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:41,860
beginner people who have done some core

00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:43,780
development you can help mentor people

00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:46,960
who have never done it before but that's

00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:49,720
not really known to you any mass kind of

00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:51,190
way and that's what we need to change so

00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:52,390
that's where I see the danger zone right

00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:53,770
now if we could build up those two

00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:56,320
levels I think we would have a way to

00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:58,390
bring more experts into the initiative

00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,130
owner status which would really help the

00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:02,290
initiative owners to have a whole you

00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:04,360
know group of you instead of just one

00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:06,040
and beginners could really become

00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:07,540
experts and help train lower level

00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:09,310
people I actually see beginners is one

00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:12,550
of the most critical levels where we're

00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:15,160
missing people right now so this is how

00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:19,120
I kind of see the organization that's

00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:22,600
going on you have one or maybe a few in

00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:25,540
some cases like jazz & Views one are a

00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:27,760
few initiative owners working with a few

00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:29,170
experts and then there's maybe some

00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:31,000
people reviewing and helping and doing

00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:33,430
patches and it's not like you have a

00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,770
team of 20 people per initiative right

00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:37,540
it's it's a limited group of people that

00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:40,089
are really sacrificing their lives in

00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:41,380
order to do this for all of us so I mean

00:10:40,089 --> 00:10:42,490
it's great that they're doing that but

00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:44,020
we can release a lot more of them

00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:45,640
especially in those middle levels like

00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:48,520
the beginner and expert levels that I

00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:50,110
was talking about another level of

00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:52,000
people who are helping our people who

00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:55,440
are doing commitments sorry commits

00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:58,630
their commitment is to commits and

00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:59,600
project management and you I you know

00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:02,209
front-end type with a

00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:04,040
they're involved but again they're

00:11:02,209 --> 00:11:08,600
limited in their involvement there's not

00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:10,819
20,000 of us there's maybe five for all

00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:13,310
of the entire group of initiative so

00:11:10,819 --> 00:11:16,730
seriously it is a limited group of

00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:18,259
people doing this stuff regularly and

00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:19,850
then the last kind of group of people

00:11:18,259 --> 00:11:21,410
that I see our other community people

00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:22,970
there are people trying to teach their

00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:26,029
people trying to fund their people

00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:28,190
trying to help with design their people

00:11:26,029 --> 00:11:30,170
trying to help you know in whatever way

00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:32,660
they can doing a review here a patch

00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:34,819
there and that's great but they're not

00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:36,889
as organized and integrated into the

00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:39,050
process as everyone else's so it's

00:11:36,889 --> 00:11:41,630
really hard to you know put all that

00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:43,579
manpower together into a machine that

00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:46,850
just rolls you know because we don't

00:11:43,579 --> 00:11:48,800
know how to coordinate them yet so

00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:52,220
there's all these people on the screen

00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:54,529
doing stuff and what we talked about is

00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:56,509
kind of you know they're awesome people

00:11:54,529 --> 00:11:57,740
and there are magical leprechauns doing

00:11:56,509 --> 00:11:58,730
things and they're building their

00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:01,430
teaching and they're climbing these

00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:03,079
mountains but really what we need is

00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:04,790
some more organization because there's a

00:12:03,079 --> 00:12:07,189
few things happening that I've seen in

00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:08,660
the my lessons learned or there's a few

00:12:07,189 --> 00:12:12,230
negative aspects to that even though I

00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:14,240
love all of these magical creatures so I

00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:16,850
feel like there's a problem with

00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:21,019
contributors basically they're they're

00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:24,319
seeing or being seen sometimes by you

00:12:21,019 --> 00:12:26,870
know experts and iOS as what are you

00:12:24,319 --> 00:12:29,209
talking about you don't know anything

00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:31,910
really you need to like go and read this

00:12:29,209 --> 00:12:34,370
and learn that so there's an education

00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:36,470
problem I think going on which would I

00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:38,810
use serial man to kind of illustrate and

00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:41,269
I feel like that's also a two-way street

00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:43,519
I feel like on the initiative on our

00:12:41,269 --> 00:12:46,000
side there's a kind of wait what are you

00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:48,230
talking about crab hat I do not get

00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,399
going on so I feel like you know there's

00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:51,949
there's some communication issues

00:12:49,399 --> 00:12:53,420
there's some training issues and that

00:12:51,949 --> 00:12:55,370
really needs to get resolved if we're

00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:57,800
going to fix the problems that we're

00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:59,569
having so that kind of ties into the

00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:01,699
learning curve consensus issue where

00:12:59,569 --> 00:13:03,829
everyone's like dude this is a little

00:13:01,699 --> 00:13:05,800
freaky how do I get started what do I do

00:13:03,829 --> 00:13:07,630
and

00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:09,459
on the other level there's people who

00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:11,080
are just like whatevs i'm gonna do with

00:13:09,459 --> 00:13:13,570
this later I can't get involved right

00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:15,690
now and they're just going to pick it up

00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:20,160
when you know things are more stable and

00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:22,390
when it's you know Thursday basically so

00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:24,339
what should we do about it is really the

00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:26,649
big question and when I was in Portland

00:13:24,339 --> 00:13:29,410
I was talking about doing a

00:13:26,649 --> 00:13:31,029
multi-faceted team organization we're

00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:32,980
kind of at the top level of people

00:13:31,029 --> 00:13:35,800
organizing you have a project manager

00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:37,600
who's supposed to help coordinate you

00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:39,760
have an initiative owner who's going to

00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:43,290
give a lot of insight into architecture

00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:46,000
and technical need and really delegate

00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:47,560
priority in in that system of

00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,560
organization because the PM should

00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:52,600
absolutely not do that and then finally

00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:54,550
fun person like lead who would be there

00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:58,240
to help coordinate all the you know

00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:59,769
visual design you xui issues around what

00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,990
we're building which is also a really

00:13:59,769 --> 00:14:04,510
big reason that Drupal 8 is is because

00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:05,950
we want to improve these ability so

00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:07,540
under that level there were lots of

00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:12,430
experts involved so people who would

00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:14,589
teach commit um fun communicate people

00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:16,660
who would also be experts technically

00:14:14,589 --> 00:14:19,300
and helped lead the the force of

00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:20,860
actually doing things and finally people

00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:22,600
who would theme and design and do you X

00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:24,520
and all that stuff and then you have the

00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:27,070
lower tiers of people who are ramping up

00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:28,600
to do more of that so those are the you

00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:32,380
know novices and beginners that I was

00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:34,300
talking about earlier so this is one way

00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:36,220
that we could do it in listening to the

00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:39,130
session again before I gave this session

00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:40,329
I feel like I have another proposal for

00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:45,160
you that might be a little bit more

00:14:40,329 --> 00:14:47,470
realistic which involves more initiative

00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:48,579
owners at the top level because one

00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:52,300
thing that we've seen is that they get

00:14:48,579 --> 00:14:54,160
so so overwhelmed and so like really

00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:56,800
solicited that there's just not enough

00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:58,240
of them to go around so having multiple

00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,699
people and I really think visas the best

00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,170
example of this to lead and coordinate

00:15:00,699 --> 00:15:04,149
is probably the best way to go

00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:06,100
especially because sometimes you get

00:15:04,149 --> 00:15:08,589
sick indigo indication some job thing

00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:10,410
comes up or whatever you know people

00:15:08,589 --> 00:15:12,550
have lives they need to be able to

00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:14,920
delegate and kind of have a team of

00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:17,199
people to work with and then I think a

00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:19,200
second tier of groups of helpers people

00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:22,590
like having a p.m. still coordinate

00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:24,120
people who want to you know teach and

00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:25,170
communicate and fund i think is a good

00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,820
thing because then they'll know what's

00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:28,350
going on in the initiative and they'll

00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:30,060
be able to say well you know we really

00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:31,500
need more people learning this because

00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:32,970
so-and-so is looking for that in the

00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:35,100
next month or there's a dependency here

00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:37,230
we need to like ramp up on resources to

00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:38,580
do this thing then they can coordinate

00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:39,960
that or they can say to someone you know

00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:41,880
I really think that we should focus on

00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:44,550
funding of this sprint because it's

00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:45,690
going to be huge for this initiative so

00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:48,630
I think that that kind of coordination

00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:50,400
is good experts I feel like you know are

00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:51,930
all kind of on the same level they need

00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:53,310
to get their work done but I really see

00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:55,020
them working closely with initiative

00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:56,970
owners as they are today I think that

00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:58,230
part is still really good I actually

00:15:56,970 --> 00:16:00,750
wouldn't change much there except

00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:02,280
bringing more of you into the fold and

00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:04,530
then finally front end which I think

00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:06,750
really needs a coordination effort from

00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:08,250
a front-end expert but there's multiple

00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:11,420
layers of that there's you know

00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:14,580
usability UX accessibility accessibility

00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:16,020
design there's really lots of things

00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:17,640
involved in front end and I think it

00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:19,650
would be great to have someone leading

00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:22,230
the charge that's why I have you know a

00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:24,720
big p.m. box and a big front end box and

00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:27,240
lots of other people involved because

00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,710
those icy has more coordinators and then

00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:30,600
obviously we need fresh meat we need

00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:32,640
people in that other tier that are just

00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:36,090
getting started and this is where I feel

00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:38,070
like you know p.m. front-end experts can

00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:40,890
serve as mentors can get involved with

00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:43,110
the mentorship program especially since

00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:46,320
you'll be in a good you know position to

00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:48,210
have the information to do that job so I

00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:50,070
see them not only leading the people

00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:54,480
that are involved but also being a

00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:55,650
driving force to get people going so

00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,090
basically what are some of the things

00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:59,280
that I think we learned I think in

00:16:57,090 --> 00:17:01,490
Drupal 8 we learned we're kind of at a

00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:03,720
math level that's how I see it like

00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:06,570
compared to the previous releases from

00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:08,490
what I've heard the initiatives are

00:17:06,570 --> 00:17:10,650
helping they're giving structure they're

00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:13,459
giving a purpose to what people are

00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:16,170
trying to accomplish and it's making the

00:17:13,459 --> 00:17:19,589
giant task of building Drupal 8 a little

00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:21,870
bit more bite-sized which is awesome we

00:17:19,589 --> 00:17:23,459
can sort of plan I see things coming out

00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:26,100
i see Sprint's happening people are

00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:28,439
organizing and that's great but we still

00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:29,580
are not a phase where we can say we

00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:31,500
think that the release is going to

00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:31,960
happen during this month depending on

00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,330
how

00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:36,220
critical bugs get fixed and whatnot so

00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:39,070
we're still not there but we're getting

00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:41,230
there some sort of releases are still

00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:43,000
long and kind of painful and tiring but

00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:44,770
you know they're getting better they're

00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,690
definitely not where they were before

00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:48,789
where it was really really really awful

00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:51,909
and hard from what people tell me to do

00:17:48,789 --> 00:17:53,890
a release and we're getting a lot more

00:17:51,909 --> 00:17:56,950
in it seems to me it feels like you know

00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:59,860
Drupal 8 is just breaking every single

00:17:56,950 --> 00:18:00,880
record of participation and what we're

00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:02,460
putting into it and what we're getting

00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:05,440
out of it is going to be just amazing

00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:07,270
and then we also have a kind of training

00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:09,059
deficit of we wish we could do more of

00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:11,230
it but we're not sure really what to do

00:18:09,059 --> 00:18:13,140
because we need more resources so I

00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:15,700
think we're kind of we're not at AA

00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:17,350
because we've obviously made a lot of

00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:19,029
steps to make this better we're not at

00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:20,620
yay because you know there's still

00:18:19,029 --> 00:18:23,919
things to do so I'd say we're kind of at

00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:27,159
math and then on d 9 I feel like we

00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:28,570
should be able to plan train funds we

00:18:27,159 --> 00:18:31,179
should be able to you know coordinate

00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:33,190
and organize and we should be able to do

00:18:31,179 --> 00:18:34,870
more better for a lot less stress

00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:37,929
capital than we've been spending because

00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:40,899
of those things so I want Drupal 9 to be

00:18:37,929 --> 00:18:43,169
sweet in terms of organization and how

00:18:40,899 --> 00:18:46,120
we're actually going forward with this

00:18:43,169 --> 00:18:47,710
and then before I actually go into

00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:48,940
discussion mode which is good because

00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:51,010
i'm at about 20 minutes and i want to

00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:53,320
have a good 40 minute discussion I

00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:54,820
really want to distress that project

00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:57,190
management is definitely going to be a

00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:58,870
part of that and I've been leading the

00:18:57,190 --> 00:19:01,000
charge up until the past few months when

00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:03,549
I just needed to take a break but I

00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,230
really strongly am looking for y'all I

00:19:03,549 --> 00:19:06,730
want you to come and find me and talk to

00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:08,409
me about this I actually I'm going to be

00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:10,960
talking with Justin several other

00:19:08,409 --> 00:19:12,130
mentors as soon as I find time about

00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,169
putting together some more core

00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:15,399
mentoring integration for project

00:19:14,169 --> 00:19:17,350
management figuring out how can we

00:19:15,399 --> 00:19:19,330
structure this because me doing it by

00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:21,100
myself is not getting the job done we

00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:23,470
need to like hook up and do this

00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:25,270
together so i want to put together some

00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:27,100
sort of mentoring program for project

00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:28,990
managers so if you're doing a project

00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:30,340
management thing and you're interested

00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:33,100
in working in drupal 8 if you're working

00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:36,610
with people who like to coordinate tell

00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:39,490
them to come see me like nowish because

00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:42,279
i am going to be off back to Paris

00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:44,320
afterwards so drew said in the keynote

00:19:42,279 --> 00:19:45,220
that leaders really make this system

00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:47,289
work and in

00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:48,940
especially in in terms of core and what

00:19:47,289 --> 00:19:51,400
we're doing here this is completely true

00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:53,110
and I feel like everyone in this room is

00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:54,250
awesomer just for being here and saying

00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:59,049
yeah I'm going to talk about core I

00:19:54,250 --> 00:20:01,690
salute you all so that said there's

00:19:59,049 --> 00:20:04,210
stuff going on Friday it's gonna be

album you should come join us so Friday

00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:08,679
there's going to be a sprint going on

00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:11,169
they have tasks for every single skill

00:20:08,679 --> 00:20:12,549
set I highly highly highly recommend you

00:20:11,169 --> 00:20:15,700

00:20:12,549 --> 00:20:17,470
super nice and super cool but you'll

00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:18,429
actually feel really amazing at the end

00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:19,600
of the day when you know that you made a

00:20:18,429 --> 00:20:22,539
difference and you did something to help

00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:24,520
bring core further to its goal it's an

00:20:22,539 --> 00:20:26,830
awesome feeling and it's a definitely a

00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:30,280
good way to use your friday so come join

00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:31,659
them and you can go see that online so

00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:33,610
let's talk about this a little bit I've

00:20:31,659 --> 00:20:34,750
given you a bunch of information about

00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:37,240
what we're doing a bunch of information

00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:39,340
about where I think we should go we've

00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:42,789
got a lot of you know organizational

00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:46,620
issues that we can discuss so let's have

00:20:42,789 --> 00:20:46,620
a chat basically who's got questions

00:20:48,210 --> 00:21:01,390
crickets crickets okay there's a mic

00:20:52,090 --> 00:21:02,559
work back there yeah thanks hi um right

00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:06,130
I missed the first five minutes because

00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:08,830
I got lost in the building sorry um it

00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:11,289
was everything important well I was

00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:13,240
looking at the slides it looks very not

00:21:11,289 --> 00:21:15,159
very it looks slightly top down and

00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:18,280
slightly silos am I worried about

00:21:15,159 --> 00:21:20,140
nothing or no I think that that's up to

00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:21,669
the people who are in those leadership

00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:23,470
positions to coordinate and they're

00:21:21,669 --> 00:21:25,030
doing a very very good job of that right

00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:26,409
now yeah I mean which is why I'm not so

00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:28,630
worried about it because I feel like out

00:21:26,409 --> 00:21:30,039
of anything that goes on if there's one

00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:31,809
thing that's pretty good these guys I'll

00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:33,760
talk to each other and get that job done

00:21:31,809 --> 00:21:35,230
so I'm pretty confident that they can

00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:37,870
keep doing that

00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:40,270
effect if next you know really is gonna

00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:41,799
be anything like this one yeah yeah I

00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:43,840
saw the change between kind of pre

00:21:41,799 --> 00:21:48,130
Portland and post Portland and you know

00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:49,540
I was kind of going yay okay well that's

00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:51,040
that's my question really nice well I

00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:53,770
mean what do you think about the silos

00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:57,400
is that I think it's dear is there

00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:59,980
another idea really well I um I think

00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:03,250
cuz you said we want to build a machine

00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:04,870
that grows yeah and like the growth I

00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:07,120
fully support the machine i think is

00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:08,890
slightly maybe perhaps older thinking

00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:10,960
where people are parts of a machine

00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:13,150
their cogs and you organize them like

00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:14,860
cogs whereas they're not people are

00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:17,410
people they have their own motivation

00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:20,169
they have their own networking they have

00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:21,910
their own you know they don't they're

00:22:20,169 --> 00:22:23,230
more like plants or something you put

00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:24,640
them and you shine the light and you

00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:27,669
step back and you hope you know that

00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:30,280
they grow well i think ideally that's

00:22:27,669 --> 00:22:31,990
what we want to happen um i totally

00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:33,460
agree with you yeah the same time they

00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:35,500
still need to know where the light is

00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:36,790
that's right you need to you know it's

00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:38,799
not good if you're trying to grow

00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:43,210
potatoes there's no good in you know

00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:45,910
harvesting grass okay all right it

00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:51,700
sounds like you've got the thing sorted

00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:57,010
out really let's all go home sweet no

00:22:51,700 --> 00:23:00,370
coffee thank you you sit down come on

00:22:57,010 --> 00:23:02,230
this is my colleague John hi hi this is

00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:04,090
not a canned question she didn't ask me

00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:07,990
to come up here I asked him to ask this

00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:10,330
question so you talked a lot about

00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:12,070
project management you're a professional

00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:13,840
project manager how many other

00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:15,640
professional project managers are

00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:18,250
involved in the initiatives to drive

00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:19,780
them forward I would categorize every

00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:21,280
single initiative owner as a project

00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:22,809
manager actually the way that they

00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:25,240
coordinate people the way that they do

00:23:22,809 --> 00:23:27,280
things I think it takes a lot of project

00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:29,080
management skills in order to do that

00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,730
kind of work so i would say that label

00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:33,250
on all of them actually no but how many

00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:35,200
of them are actually project managers in

00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:39,460
there oh and there are actual jobs yeah

00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:42,840
uh in title 0 I think I don't know angie

00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:42,840
is that a part of your title

00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:49,350
auntie is special unicorn so you should

00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:51,540
just make a card with a unicorn on it is

00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:53,580
passive is that a request you know

00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:54,990
you're gonna is a request out to get

00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:57,900
more professional project managers

00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:59,780
definitely it's a huge request it's a

00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:03,210
need I think if we're going to help

00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:06,360
coordinate mass groups of people I think

00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:08,370
you need I hate to do this but I kind of

00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:11,910
feel as a project manager that you're

00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:14,400
like a minion it's a service job like

00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:16,350
I'm not there to take credit for

00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,910
anything that's going on I just want to

00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:20,220
help make sure that it does happen I

00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:22,050
want to tap people are you doing this

00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:25,650
did you get that how can I help you I

00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:27,810
see it as a real kind of public service

00:24:25,650 --> 00:24:29,970
office you know and so I think that we

00:24:27,810 --> 00:24:32,460
could always use more of those and more

00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:34,850
people who are willing to go find people

00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:38,250
or inform people or communicate or

00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:39,660
coordinate or even you know just some

00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:41,910
sprint happen i'm going to write a blog

00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:44,430
post about it and maybe 200 people will

00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:46,170
see that think oh cool I should maybe do

00:24:44,430 --> 00:24:48,060
that too I mean there's lots of ways

00:24:46,170 --> 00:24:50,700
that PM's can get the word out and can

00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:53,430
help and I thought that there's it's a

00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:55,800
multi-role type of job so we can always

00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:59,670
use more of them yeah I guess closing

00:24:55,800 --> 00:25:03,060
comment I think a lot of pm's get a very

00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:06,240
hard pushed as you know and a very busy

00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:08,490
in their regular job and you know its

00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:11,610
lucky that you're able to do this as

00:25:08,490 --> 00:25:13,950
well it would be nice to see more kind

00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:16,200
of top-level management allowing their

00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:18,000
pms time to come in and work on

00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:19,350
initiatives because it's really critical

00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,780
for the community and i think actually

00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:24,330
more professional pms working within

00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:26,700
this structure would allow it to work a

00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:30,180
lot more smoothly so yeah i agree with

00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:32,160
you i love that comment more like go ask

00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:35,370
your bosses to ask your pm's to get

00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:36,930
involved that would be amazing I mean

00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:39,450
ask your bosses to get everyone involved

00:25:36,930 --> 00:25:41,040
but um I would love it if there are more

00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:43,350
pm's involved because then I could help

00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:45,420
these guys do more and I can totally

00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:45,730
understand with me being busy and not

00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:47,950
having

00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:50,680
time I actually had to take a hiatus

00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:52,420
from doing Drupal 8 stuff and it's been

00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:55,570
the saddest like three months of my life

00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:57,880
I really am dying to get back into it

00:25:55,570 --> 00:26:00,550
and I'm determined to absolutely as soon

00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:02,170
as I possibly can ie like next week I'm

00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:03,580
doing it because I can't stand not being

00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:05,380
in there anymore that's how awesome

00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:09,090
these people are once you get going you

00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:11,530
don't want to leave love you too are you

00:26:09,090 --> 00:26:13,570
are you exposing the unborn child to

00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:15,340
dribble in any way what are you exposing

00:26:13,570 --> 00:26:17,770
the unborn child to drink plain anyway

00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:19,930
uh exposing the unborn child to Drupal

00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:21,580
well not yet I think he's probably gonna

00:26:19,930 --> 00:26:24,550
hear a lot of you know sessions and a

00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:27,330
lot of drupal talk through me already in

00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:30,520
utero he's getting something education

00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:32,200
starting um ok so my actual question can

00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:35,170
you talk more about the time commitment

00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:37,330
of a p.m. in Drupal space and does that

00:26:35,170 --> 00:26:40,930
change if you've got like collaboration

00:26:37,330 --> 00:26:43,270
between PMZ one vertical ok um so I

00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:45,040
would say that's an excellent excellent

00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:47,680
question the time commitment is

00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:49,300
definitely different depending on the on

00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:51,610
the vertical that you're in time which

00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:53,730
initiative you're working on I think

00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:55,960
that that is partly due to technology

00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:59,200
some of the initiatives are just more

00:26:55,960 --> 00:27:02,230
technically hard than others and they

00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:05,710
take more time to learn and I think some

00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:07,780
of the initiatives are a little bit well

00:27:05,710 --> 00:27:09,730
then maybe they've been around longer so

00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:11,680
they've got more organization and more

00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:15,300
training behind them so it makes them

00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:18,550
easier to wrap up on and having you know

00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:20,920
try to help with uh with blocks and

00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:23,380
layouts I I can tell you firsthand that

00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:25,530
it takes someone with an awful lot of

00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:27,880
technical know-how and more than I have

00:27:25,530 --> 00:27:30,100
so there are definitely different levels

00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:33,760
of PM that we could use if you want to

00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:36,430
be really involved so I would say time

00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:38,620
commitment would obviously be helping to

00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:39,880
coordinate well you'd have to do some

00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:42,400
learning if you want to take on one of

00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:45,430
the bigger roles and I would say a good

00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:48,220
thing to do is to plan a couple weeks

00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:50,170
like half an hour a night something like

00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:51,610
that reading just trying to find out

00:27:50,170 --> 00:27:53,980
what's going on or how does this stuff

00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:56,320
work if you want to be really really

00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:57,460
involved that's the maximum level I

00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:59,320
would say and then you probably want to

00:27:57,460 --> 00:28:01,060
plan you know time to

00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:03,220
offload or get training from your IO

00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:05,140
your initiative owner and you probably

00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:07,120
want to plan time to do sprints and

00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:09,370
organization with them so that's going

00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:11,380
to take time to so I would say if you

00:28:09,370 --> 00:28:13,720
really want to be a maximum level

00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:18,040
involvement you should plan at least a

00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:20,890
few hours a week minimum and I think if

00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:23,380
you want to be less involved and maybe

00:28:20,890 --> 00:28:24,340
just you know I said the most the

00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:26,200
smallest thing that you could probably

00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:28,480
do to help an initiative owner would be

00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:31,450
to go out and get an update and that and

00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:33,580
my experience can take 15-20 minutes so

00:28:31,450 --> 00:28:35,830
there's all different ranges of what you

00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:38,140
can do to try and help in the PM role

00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:39,700
you can spend hours every single week

00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:41,110
and really invest and really help

00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:43,810
coordinate and organize and get things

00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:46,240
done and that's an amazing feeling when

00:28:43,810 --> 00:28:48,760
you can do that or you can say you know

00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:50,650
I am just too busy right now all I can

00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:53,380
do is give you 15 minutes and i am happy

00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:54,970
to post an update does it play out in

00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:57,130
the same way that other contributions

00:28:54,970 --> 00:28:58,660
will wear that's obvious where the gaps

00:28:57,130 --> 00:29:02,520
are and you just simply just fill those

00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:05,980
holes in terms of planning in terms of

00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:07,690
panning know is it much more of a

00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:09,280
collaborative with the IO I think it's

00:29:07,690 --> 00:29:11,140
more collaborative with the IO I mean

00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:13,570
honestly when you're doing this stuff I

00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:17,650
don't think that you as the PM is are

00:29:13,570 --> 00:29:19,630
going to know what's needed next you

00:29:17,650 --> 00:29:21,070
know it's not your role the the

00:29:19,630 --> 00:29:22,540
initiative owner is the one leading that

00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:25,030
charge there the one making things

00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:28,120
happen and they need to tell you how to

00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:29,590
help coordinate you can't say well you

00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:31,330
know you should really change this code

00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:33,850
instead of that code you're not going to

00:29:31,330 --> 00:29:36,520
know that so unless you're like super

00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:43,390
smart which case your way cool urban

00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:47,020
ions yeah so first of all I really like

00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:49,630
your diagrams I think are very that was

00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:51,820
a very helpful and very like precise way

00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:53,830
of analyzing our current situation so

00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:57,820
thanks for that because sure sort of

00:29:53,830 --> 00:30:00,720
yeah um and so I have one maybe one

00:29:57,820 --> 00:30:03,280
suggestion in terms of the organization

00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:07,630
so I'd like to hear what you what you

00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:09,520
think about it because I think so the

00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:11,530
suggestion would be to to make the

00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:14,950
initiatives smaller in scope

00:30:11,530 --> 00:30:17,380
general because for drupal 7 just as an

00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:20,020
example the whiskey initiative was like

00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:21,310
huge and then it started and then we

00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:24,250
figured out oh we have to basically

00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:26,620
rewrite all of core to use a dependency

00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:29,410
injection before we can even start on

00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:33,370
the real whiskey stuff and so that was

00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:35,320
this whole big thing and for translation

00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:37,690
because we want to translate

00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:40,450
configuration so we have to wait until

00:30:37,690 --> 00:30:42,520
configuration is done until we can even

00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:44,610
know like how to translate and what to

00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:48,310
translate so it was like this huge

00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:50,530
undertaking and the actual things to do

00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:52,540
changed so much over the course of the

00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:55,570
time because it was like the initiatives

00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:58,180
were we're started like very early in

00:30:55,570 --> 00:30:59,950
development and then like one and a half

00:30:58,180 --> 00:31:01,690
years later so much has changed but it's

00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:05,230
still the same initiatives right and

00:31:01,690 --> 00:31:06,700
things like twig or like entity ng and

00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:08,410
everything they weren't official

00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:11,860
initiatives so they didn't have like all

00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:14,380
the infrastructure quote-unquote that

00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:16,480
the others had so yeah that would be

00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:21,510
like that sounds like multiple questions

00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:24,340
to me um so like how do we manage scope

00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:27,520
how do we keep things contained and can

00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:29,080
we make them smaller so that we can have

00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:31,390
more focus sounds like your first

00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:33,100
question right so well the the proposal

00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:36,010
would be to not have an initiative like

00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:40,480
turn drupal into proper web services

00:31:36,010 --> 00:31:42,520
thing but like try to inject some stuff

00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:44,800
first so that have that the initiative

00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:46,270
and then that only takes like three

00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:48,400
months maybe and then we're sort of done

00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:51,940
and then we can plan okay so we're here

00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:54,550
now now the next like bigger step would

00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:56,650
be to actually do the whiskey routing or

00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:59,200
whatever you know just as an example but

00:31:56,650 --> 00:32:01,030
not have like one initiative over one

00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:03,550
and a half years and that constantly

00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:05,650
changing and interacts with like a bunch

00:32:03,550 --> 00:32:07,570
of different initiatives so oh I like

00:32:05,650 --> 00:32:10,660
that idea I think what could be really

00:32:07,570 --> 00:32:12,580
good about that is that you're phasing

00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:13,990
initiatives which is one thing that I

00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:16,810
think would have really helped us a lot

00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:18,370
in a lot of ways for one of those

00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:19,960
reasons as we needed to know what the

00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:21,830
dependencies are that's also why I think

00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:23,929
that that might be really hard to do

00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:26,539
because one of the big challenges that

00:32:23,929 --> 00:32:28,970
we faced is you know as a group I think

00:32:26,539 --> 00:32:30,860
this applies to everybody is finding the

00:32:28,970 --> 00:32:33,320
dependencies between each other's

00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:36,230
initiatives and finding the dependencies

00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:38,450
in our own initiative so I feel like

00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:40,580
that was a challenge that maybe we

00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:44,330
didn't know enough about what we were

00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:47,570
trying to do to in order to do that

00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:49,370
organization but there's some guys here

00:32:47,570 --> 00:32:51,760
we're doing it so maybe they should talk

00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:54,169
to so I think it's very hard to face

00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:56,269
because you do something and then you

00:32:54,169 --> 00:32:57,710
start using that API and implement that

00:32:56,269 --> 00:33:00,169
and then you figure out that that was

00:32:57,710 --> 00:33:02,510
not good and then you write it anyway so

00:33:00,169 --> 00:33:05,059
if you try to face it and then you will

00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:07,820
need to reread them either way so we

00:33:05,059 --> 00:33:10,519
need to do it and use it it's painful

00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:12,409
yes but otherwise we don't find out

00:33:10,519 --> 00:33:13,970
whether whether it was actually right or

00:33:12,409 --> 00:33:15,380
not right so it's like you can inflate

00:33:13,970 --> 00:33:16,730
the basketball but you won't know if it

00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:20,510
bounced until you throw it on the ground

00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:22,190
yeah so yeah and the other thing is I

00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:24,380
think the big initiatives what good

00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:25,909
about them is you can have different

00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:28,549
areas where you can still make progress

00:33:25,909 --> 00:33:31,429
while you can stop some others so you

00:33:28,549 --> 00:33:33,230
multilingual for example we didn't work

00:33:31,429 --> 00:33:34,880
on some things that were in so much in

00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:36,860
flux but we could still be active in

00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:38,539
other areas so you don't lose the

00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:40,429
momentum of the initiative because you

00:33:38,539 --> 00:33:42,169
don't stop you do something you're just

00:33:40,429 --> 00:33:43,639
working another area and then you come

00:33:42,169 --> 00:33:45,769
back to this area when it becomes

00:33:43,639 --> 00:33:47,330
available for work you had a lot of

00:33:45,769 --> 00:33:49,850
low-hanging fruit that you were kind of

00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:51,500
putting people on in the meantime so

00:33:49,850 --> 00:33:53,179
they're not just sitting around waiting

00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:55,279
for something and that's another really

00:33:53,179 --> 00:33:57,139
good idea is to always have someone

00:33:55,279 --> 00:34:00,889
managing the low-hanging fruits that the

00:33:57,139 --> 00:34:02,750
momentum never dies love just to pin on

00:34:00,889 --> 00:34:04,130
the same subject but it's quite normal

00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:05,899
not to know what you're doing at the

00:34:04,130 --> 00:34:09,589
beginning of a project that's that's

00:34:05,899 --> 00:34:10,820
exactly right which why who decides and

00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:13,399
what the initiatives are can't the

00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:15,800
initiative itself decide actually you

00:34:13,399 --> 00:34:18,020
know our overall goal is

00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:19,909
internationalization but now actually

00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:21,830
with to with you know we need to rewrite

00:34:19,909 --> 00:34:23,450
core to make you know backwards or

00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:25,280
forwards compatible with this new thing

00:34:23,450 --> 00:34:27,470
and then we also need to do this and

00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:29,359
they fragment-based self-organized well

00:34:27,470 --> 00:34:30,679
that's that's good how it happens like

00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:31,819
there's some discovery that happens at

00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:33,109
the beginning of the initiatives the

00:34:31,819 --> 00:34:35,369
problem that we're having I think is

00:34:33,109 --> 00:34:37,440
that it's not official enough

00:34:35,369 --> 00:34:40,559
the first goal of the initiative should

00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:42,899
be to define the initiative and we set a

00:34:40,559 --> 00:34:44,970
goal we want to do multilingual then we

00:34:42,899 --> 00:34:46,799
should spend three months determining

00:34:44,970 --> 00:34:48,779
what that means and deciding this means

00:34:46,799 --> 00:34:51,269
we're doing this and not that and I

00:34:48,779 --> 00:34:52,919
think some of that happened and I don't

00:34:51,269 --> 00:34:54,929
want to discredit anyone in here for not

00:34:52,919 --> 00:34:57,539
doing that because I think that did go

00:34:54,929 --> 00:34:59,579
on just maybe for a really long time and

00:34:57,539 --> 00:35:01,920
I would like to see it more time boxed

00:34:59,579 --> 00:35:05,309
for the next release so that we can try

00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:07,380
and once we know that we can start

00:35:05,309 --> 00:35:10,200
digging into those dependencies and then

00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:11,430
trying to phase and I really feel one of

00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:13,529
the sites that i actually deleted i

00:35:11,430 --> 00:35:15,960
thought i was going to be too long was I

00:35:13,529 --> 00:35:18,269
had a whole phases within phases slide

00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:20,460
that was supposed to like you know show

00:35:18,269 --> 00:35:22,019
show how you can have a big project and

00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:24,059
it's got three parts and then those

00:35:22,019 --> 00:35:25,740
three parts have six parts right and

00:35:24,059 --> 00:35:27,359
that is so much easier for people to

00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:29,190
wrap their heads around me the hard

00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:30,660
thing is getting there to that level of

00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:32,640
information where you can do that kind

00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:34,410
of planning which is why I feel like

00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:36,900
PM's could really help because that's

00:35:34,410 --> 00:35:39,839
what we do we try and look at this

00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:41,730
and go let's cut that up and that makes

00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:43,589
it so much easier to get it done so I

00:35:41,730 --> 00:35:45,059
mean keep talking about project

00:35:43,589 --> 00:35:47,880
management but I feel like it's it's a

00:35:45,059 --> 00:35:49,470
missing piece you know I have done

00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:52,319
enough of it I can't do enough of it by

00:35:49,470 --> 00:35:54,180
myself so instead of the the vault that

00:35:52,319 --> 00:35:55,289
sort of slide with three verticals what

00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:57,210
you're actually going to see it's three

00:35:55,289 --> 00:35:59,130
verticals and then they split and then

00:35:57,210 --> 00:36:01,200
they split and then they split and what

00:35:59,130 --> 00:36:05,029
you just have this radiating pattern now

00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:05,029
that's what we should be aiming for

00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:19,430
okay okay sure sure you start saying

00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:21,260
something or my turn no go ahead ask

00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:23,359
your question while I make the splitting

00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:24,589
graphic that he's talking about so what

00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:26,750
I'm saying now maybe might not be

00:36:24,589 --> 00:36:30,170
totally helpful for now even for a

00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:31,790
juvenile so I had the idea might be

00:36:30,170 --> 00:36:34,010
wrong that for open source projects

00:36:31,790 --> 00:36:36,619
there might be like an ideal size both

00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:40,460
in the amount of code and in the size of

00:36:36,619 --> 00:36:41,930
the team and maybe four if you if you

00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:44,270
throw money at it then you can have the

00:36:41,930 --> 00:36:48,290
team bigger or something maybe I don't

00:36:44,270 --> 00:36:50,270
know k like in a composer and a lot of

00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:53,000
trooper models when I want to when have

00:36:50,270 --> 00:36:54,829
an idea I can final issue and then I

00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:57,530
immediately get to talked with like the

00:36:54,829 --> 00:37:00,170
boss and this guy can decide if you want

00:36:57,530 --> 00:37:02,089
to have that or not and if I don't like

00:37:00,170 --> 00:37:04,460
that and I say okay I do it myself I'd a

00:37:02,089 --> 00:37:06,410
fork it and it's small enough to do that

00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:09,619
and then someone can go and make a

00:37:06,410 --> 00:37:12,140
distribution and posle different pieces

00:37:09,619 --> 00:37:14,290
together and then it becomes bigger but

00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:16,730
still the pieces are small and there's

00:37:14,290 --> 00:37:19,309
teams that are dedicated to one thing

00:37:16,730 --> 00:37:22,069
and I know about their sting that's kind

00:37:19,309 --> 00:37:23,480
of what we want to do yeah I know that

00:37:22,069 --> 00:37:25,970
the small pieces have little times

00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:29,329
distributing like that Drupal is a bit

00:37:25,970 --> 00:37:31,970
bigger than this average ideal size core

00:37:29,329 --> 00:37:33,890
at least yes that's another question

00:37:31,970 --> 00:37:36,200
which you're allowed to ask you're

00:37:33,890 --> 00:37:37,910
allowed to say is core not too big or

00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:39,380
too small i put the fork up there for

00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:41,900
reasons that you know that question

00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:43,849
could be and it's not just like for like

00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:45,500
I'm small project like a module and

00:37:43,849 --> 00:37:48,260
roopa then it doesn't split any

00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:50,660
community it just puts an alternative

00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:53,450
out there maybe sometimes it will maybe

00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:56,740
but um so where they want to go with

00:37:53,450 --> 00:37:56,740
this yes what is the question

00:37:59,990 --> 00:38:08,640
so maybe I want to just wanted to throw

00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:15,090
out some ideas like um and I didn't

00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:16,830
sleep last night sir microphone I guess

00:38:15,090 --> 00:38:19,140
I'm just a small car person so that's it

00:38:16,830 --> 00:38:21,390
i'm going to Don Quixote rosetta stone I

00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:24,890
think what he's saying is that right now

00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:27,420
we have this large project with very few

00:38:24,890 --> 00:38:29,280
points of contact in order to figure out

00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:31,560
like if something is a good idea or not

00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:32,940
I think you're advocating is a bunch of

00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:34,860
smaller projects or at least

00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:36,720
well-defined leaders in all different

00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:39,030
areas so that when you want to make an

00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:41,910
improvement to place x there you know i

00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:43,770
can ask bob or jane and she can tell me

00:38:41,910 --> 00:38:45,600
yes or no and then if i don't like the

00:38:43,770 --> 00:38:47,370
answer then i have the freedom to go do

00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:49,500
other things or add the freedom to

00:38:47,370 --> 00:38:53,550
experiment and see how far i get with it

00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:56,640
is that correct yeah at one time i

00:38:53,550 --> 00:38:58,890
wanted i thought that endeavor this crew

00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:02,010
more thing is it sucks and i said i do

00:38:58,890 --> 00:39:05,220
my own and then i might a module which

00:39:02,010 --> 00:39:06,810
is just data and I could just go ahead

00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:08,460
and do that and now I'm the kind of the

00:39:06,810 --> 00:39:14,490
boss of this model which no one uses but

00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:16,020
anyway and in Drupal if I want to I

00:39:14,490 --> 00:39:17,870
think I have a cool idea I want to do

00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:20,520
this and I can write a patch and then

00:39:17,870 --> 00:39:23,370
maybe no one will notice and it will

00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:27,440
just that's kind of discouraging

00:39:23,370 --> 00:39:30,300
sometimes what's discouraging about it

00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:33,330
no I mean it sometimes just more fun to

00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:36,750
just do something and then it's finished

00:39:33,330 --> 00:39:39,240
product and has my name on it and it

00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:41,880
works and instead of having to convince

00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:45,080
a lot of people right well it's just an

00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:47,640
observation I can tell you from

00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:50,370
observation if you're working in core

00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:51,930
you're gonna have to be a rally ER you

00:39:50,370 --> 00:39:54,270
have to be someone who is willing to get

00:39:51,930 --> 00:39:56,580
people to work on your cause and it's a

00:39:54,270 --> 00:39:58,680
big part of the job so if you're not

00:39:56,580 --> 00:40:01,350
interested in trying to say hey I need

00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:02,700
reviewers or hey I need to do this then

00:40:01,350 --> 00:40:04,470
you know you either need to get

00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:07,080
interested or you should find some other

00:40:04,470 --> 00:40:08,760
way to contribute like like being one of

00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:10,289
those occasional reviewers or

00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:12,150
contributors that way

00:40:10,289 --> 00:40:13,829
because people who are taking on

00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:15,660
leadership roles are going to need to do

00:40:13,829 --> 00:40:22,039
a lot of that and it's all it's a lot of

00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:25,650
their time yeah okay that was my idea

00:40:22,039 --> 00:40:26,999
thank you hi I'm Doug green this is a

00:40:25,650 --> 00:40:28,469
conversation I don't really have a

00:40:26,999 --> 00:40:30,539
question I kind of disagree with what

00:40:28,469 --> 00:40:32,189
you just said there that you know if

00:40:30,539 --> 00:40:33,839
you're not going to be a rally or that

00:40:32,189 --> 00:40:35,429
you know you shouldn't be involved in

00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:37,109
court well you should be a leader in

00:40:35,429 --> 00:40:39,509
court like you should be involved

00:40:37,109 --> 00:40:42,089
different in a different way but if

00:40:39,509 --> 00:40:45,059
you're not ready to try and get you

00:40:42,089 --> 00:40:47,789
involved and stay involved then I think

00:40:45,059 --> 00:40:49,619
core leadership is not a role that

00:40:47,789 --> 00:40:51,569
you're going to thrive and enjoy like

00:40:49,619 --> 00:40:52,910
you would maybe just contributing so

00:40:51,569 --> 00:40:55,589
really the other way you know the

00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:58,619
conversation I wanted to bring up and

00:40:55,589 --> 00:41:02,759
you know I don't have I feel bad about

00:40:58,619 --> 00:41:05,579
my commitment to 2d eight so far don't

00:41:02,759 --> 00:41:07,019
worry I've done very little it because I

00:41:05,579 --> 00:41:10,019
don't have the time and I you know I

00:41:07,019 --> 00:41:15,539
think Oh hugs from Larry make everything

00:41:10,019 --> 00:41:17,969
better word Larry should like everyone

00:41:15,539 --> 00:41:20,849
you get a hug and you get a hug and you

00:41:17,969 --> 00:41:22,079
get a hug I think the trees trees has

00:41:20,849 --> 00:41:24,239
brought this up before about the

00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:27,089
professional development class you know

00:41:24,239 --> 00:41:28,319
the funding for it for Drupal core you

00:41:27,089 --> 00:41:29,880
know and the model that you were

00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:32,219
bringing out was trying to get as many

00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:34,319
people involved as possible and how do

00:41:32,219 --> 00:41:36,299
we coordinate that which you know is

00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:38,579
getting away from our roots a little bit

00:41:36,299 --> 00:41:41,029
our roots was open sores scratch your

00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:43,380
own edge I write something because I it

00:41:41,029 --> 00:41:45,209
satisfies something I want to do and as

00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:47,849
soon as we start organizing the way

00:41:45,209 --> 00:41:50,449
we're trying to do I'm just using out

00:41:47,849 --> 00:41:54,089
loud that our project has grown so much

00:41:50,449 --> 00:41:56,459
I think the Linux model with something

00:41:54,089 --> 00:42:00,329
greece's mentioned before you know and

00:41:56,459 --> 00:42:02,640
Acquia you know by itself is following

00:42:00,329 --> 00:42:05,519
that model so what do you mean by the

00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:08,009
Linux model tell us what your vision of

00:42:05,519 --> 00:42:09,929
that looks like my understanding red hat

00:42:08,009 --> 00:42:12,439
where you've got a company where people

00:42:09,929 --> 00:42:16,229
are paid full time to actually improve

00:42:12,439 --> 00:42:17,369
product and funding of it so I just

00:42:16,229 --> 00:42:18,630
wanted to throw it as part of this

00:42:17,369 --> 00:42:21,659
conversation that it's not just

00:42:18,630 --> 00:42:22,360
organizing people you know in project

00:42:21,659 --> 00:42:25,240
management

00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:26,860
getting more workers and I know we're

00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:29,320
trying to solve this but I think we've

00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:32,560
reached a precipice that you're you're

00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:34,060
pointing out that we need to fund more

00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:38,770
people and I don't know how we do that

00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:42,040
mmm Kadri specifically mentioned i wrote

00:42:38,770 --> 00:42:44,110
coder module eight years ago or

00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:46,660
something when I didn't have work for

00:42:44,110 --> 00:42:48,940
two weeks you know well now I've got

00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:52,570
work every single week and I can't write

00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:54,070
the the d8 upgrade module because I've

00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:56,320
got too much client work and it's a

00:42:54,070 --> 00:42:57,640
problem that were a victim of our own

00:42:56,320 --> 00:43:00,280
success and I don't know what our

00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:03,520
solution is right now to get you know

00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:05,890
more people involved like Larry does I

00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:09,580
don't have the time to commit that Larry

00:43:05,890 --> 00:43:11,680
does well so I think there's a really

00:43:09,580 --> 00:43:15,220
good question in there which is we need

00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:17,890
more people involved but how do we do

00:43:15,220 --> 00:43:20,200
that and i would point to jess's at the

00:43:17,890 --> 00:43:22,630
mic and sake or mentors are there to

00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:26,890
help you when it Kathy because i'm kind

00:43:22,630 --> 00:43:31,030
of like well yeah go tell you except you

00:43:26,890 --> 00:43:32,440
started it so I I'm actually doing

00:43:31,030 --> 00:43:33,850
something I learned from Kathy which is

00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:35,050
I was taking notes on my phone this

00:43:33,850 --> 00:43:37,000
whole time because there was always like

00:43:35,050 --> 00:43:39,700
interrupting everyone so I just wanted

00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:41,680
to respond to a couple things and now

00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:43,810
there's four because of what doug said

00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:46,660
so the first thing is i want to say that

00:43:43,810 --> 00:43:48,550
i don't think that we should call Acquia

00:43:46,660 --> 00:43:51,190
the redhead of drupal despite internet

00:43:48,550 --> 00:43:53,050
memes and very awkward emails sent to

00:43:51,190 --> 00:43:55,960
other project leads i think that like

00:43:53,050 --> 00:43:57,640
i'm very proud that i have a job where I

00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:59,590
can work on drupal full time I'm very

00:43:57,640 --> 00:44:01,450
proud of what aqua contributes but at

00:43:59,590 --> 00:44:04,210
the same time it's stupid that there

00:44:01,450 --> 00:44:05,410
aren't more companies supporting and

00:44:04,210 --> 00:44:07,390
there are you know I think with you know

00:44:05,410 --> 00:44:08,860
we need to talk more about Commerce guys

00:44:07,390 --> 00:44:10,240
about the time that Chris Vander water

00:44:08,860 --> 00:44:12,760
has had to work on core we need to talk

00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:14,140
more about you know and different ways

00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:15,700
of doing that like like the way that

00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:17,710
palantir does things they don't they

00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:20,320
don't have contribution time during

00:44:17,710 --> 00:44:21,940
their as part of their like paid time

00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:23,500
but at the same time they're very

00:44:21,940 --> 00:44:24,910
protective of their employees schedule

00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:26,620
so that people like Larry have the

00:44:24,910 --> 00:44:28,270
energy to give back after the end of the

00:44:26,620 --> 00:44:29,980
work that they do for their clients so I

00:44:28,270 --> 00:44:30,910
think that that's just something i

00:44:29,980 --> 00:44:32,620
wanted to point out and there's other

00:44:30,910 --> 00:44:34,270
models to like I don't know if evidence

00:44:32,620 --> 00:44:35,920
saw Alex pot today in the keynote this

00:44:34,270 --> 00:44:38,020
morning he's not working

00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:40,299
now he's getting some funding weekly

00:44:38,020 --> 00:44:41,710
from just like random small donors in

00:44:40,299 --> 00:44:43,319
the community so that's another model

00:44:41,710 --> 00:44:46,690
that we can look at can be fun people

00:44:43,319 --> 00:44:47,680
just like ten dollars at a time if we

00:44:46,690 --> 00:44:49,930
have enough people that are relieved

00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:52,390
like hey you make my life easier have a

00:44:49,930 --> 00:44:53,770
buck have a coffee or you know let me

00:44:52,390 --> 00:44:55,450
help pay part of your mortgage it it

00:44:53,770 --> 00:44:57,730
makes sense okay so that that's all

00:44:55,450 --> 00:45:00,280
about I it's not just on aqua people

00:44:57,730 --> 00:45:02,770
right then yeah yeah that's a really

00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:05,349
really good point aquia is an amazing

00:45:02,770 --> 00:45:09,460
contributor to what is going on I think

00:45:05,349 --> 00:45:12,069
in my opinion the biggest but um you

00:45:09,460 --> 00:45:13,839
know there's a lot of stigma around that

00:45:12,069 --> 00:45:16,780
how people perceive it and I think that

00:45:13,839 --> 00:45:18,819
if it were if it weren't one big company

00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:21,130
doing that if it were like 40 small

00:45:18,819 --> 00:45:23,380
shops doing that nobody would be linking

00:45:21,130 --> 00:45:25,569
and I but I think that the fact that

00:45:23,380 --> 00:45:28,660
it's one people do blink and they asked

00:45:25,569 --> 00:45:31,329
questions about it and my personal

00:45:28,660 --> 00:45:32,710
vision of that is thank God that there

00:45:31,329 --> 00:45:33,760
is one big company willing to do that

00:45:32,710 --> 00:45:36,400
because we wouldn't have triple-a

00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:38,619
without it we just wouldn't so I'm kind

00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:40,359
of a big THANK YOU Acquia type of person

00:45:38,619 --> 00:45:42,730
and not everyone will agree with me on

00:45:40,359 --> 00:45:44,440
that but I'm really grateful but there

00:45:42,730 --> 00:45:46,720
are others doing it and if everybody did

00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:49,030
it it would make the hugest difference

00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:50,680
in the world but then there's also the

00:45:49,030 --> 00:45:52,599
big question of how do we handle that

00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:54,369
and that raises a thousand other

00:45:52,599 --> 00:45:55,930
questions which maybe we should talk

00:45:54,369 --> 00:45:57,760
about if we have time in the next 10

00:45:55,930 --> 00:45:59,290
minutes so I'm gonna so to go through my

00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:00,819
two other things that were responses to

00:45:59,290 --> 00:46:02,109
other people and then I have a plea so

00:46:00,819 --> 00:46:03,579
the two other things was in response to

00:46:02,109 --> 00:46:05,410
the question about what whether the

00:46:03,579 --> 00:46:08,049
initiative structure was to top down and

00:46:05,410 --> 00:46:09,280
whether the siloing was a problem first

00:46:08,049 --> 00:46:10,960
of all with regard to the siloing I

00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:13,359
think that Shannon helped us fix that a

00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:14,980
lot we we have these calls every two

00:46:13,359 --> 00:46:16,450
weeks with the initiative leads where we

00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:17,950
talk to each other I mean we talk to

00:46:16,450 --> 00:46:19,990
each other all the time on IRC in the

00:46:17,950 --> 00:46:21,640
issue queue but this is like a block of

00:46:19,990 --> 00:46:22,990
time specifically set up for initiative

00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:24,730
owners to say to each other hey I'm

00:46:22,990 --> 00:46:27,520
blocked on this hey I need help with

00:46:24,730 --> 00:46:28,750
this hey I've got this thing and um gab

00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:30,099
or do I need to worry about the

00:46:28,750 --> 00:46:32,770
multilingual part of this because I have

00:46:30,099 --> 00:46:35,020
no idea what to do here um so I think

00:46:32,770 --> 00:46:36,400
that we've we've already made a start at

00:46:35,020 --> 00:46:39,190
addressing that like nipping that

00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:40,930
problem in the bud it's always going to

00:46:39,190 --> 00:46:42,549
be a challenge and but worth guard at

00:46:40,930 --> 00:46:43,990
the top down part of it I actually think

00:46:42,549 --> 00:46:46,390
the opposite is true I think that having

00:46:43,990 --> 00:46:49,690
good leaders who will like say hey

00:46:46,390 --> 00:46:51,550
you're awesome you know you can help me

00:46:49,690 --> 00:46:53,920
you're doing a really great job with

00:46:51,550 --> 00:46:55,840
this please take this off my plate like

00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:58,660
that that gets people more involved and

00:46:55,840 --> 00:47:00,700
more excited it's I think being a leader

00:46:58,660 --> 00:47:02,650
like in the squares the top it's not

00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:05,200
about saying do this it's about saying

00:47:02,650 --> 00:47:07,210
you're great you could be even greater

00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:08,560
come help me and it's about empowering

00:47:07,210 --> 00:47:09,520
people and encouraging them to get more

00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:11,890
involved and do what they care about

00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:15,610
under passionate so that I think I think

00:47:11,890 --> 00:47:19,650
they were you guys all need to be

00:47:15,610 --> 00:47:19,650
cheerleaders I want to make you skirts i

00:47:20,670 --> 00:47:28,210
I'm not i would not know that doesn't

00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:30,550
work and then about um the scoping of

00:47:28,210 --> 00:47:33,040
initiatives i agree i think that we

00:47:30,550 --> 00:47:34,270
learned from whiskey which became two

00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:36,190
initiatives which might have could have

00:47:34,270 --> 00:47:39,840
become ten initiatives but on the other

00:47:36,190 --> 00:47:42,160
hand i also think that having big

00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:43,990
inspiring ideas is important because

00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:45,250
it's like one thing to say like hey when

00:47:43,990 --> 00:47:46,750
you want to make core more unit testable

00:47:45,250 --> 00:47:48,820
that's awesome and that's cool but that

00:47:46,750 --> 00:47:50,230
doesn't really like bring in the the

00:47:48,820 --> 00:47:51,820
passion that doesn't bring in the money

00:47:50,230 --> 00:47:53,740
because funding is always a problem that

00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:55,270
doesn't bring in the sort of like

00:47:53,740 --> 00:47:56,770
inspiration so i think that we

00:47:55,270 --> 00:47:58,780
definitely need to have a i think a

00:47:56,770 --> 00:48:00,820
better way of organizing those sort of

00:47:58,780 --> 00:48:02,440
like small projects maybe we can call

00:48:00,820 --> 00:48:03,700
them just individual projects would be

00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:05,410
great but i think that the big

00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:08,260
initiatives are still a good idea though

00:48:05,410 --> 00:48:11,290
maybe not quite rewrite all of drupal in

00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:14,320
scope Larry love you and then the third

00:48:11,290 --> 00:48:19,510
thing I wanted to say that's true that's

00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:22,000
true it's well anyway Larry then so then

00:48:19,510 --> 00:48:23,410
just my plea I wanted to like underscore

00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,940
everything Shannon saying about people

00:48:23,410 --> 00:48:26,860
who are going to organize other people

00:48:24,940 --> 00:48:29,110
people who have some sort of project

00:48:26,860 --> 00:48:30,670
management or communication skill it is

00:48:29,110 --> 00:48:32,860
I've been kind of in this situation

00:48:30,670 --> 00:48:35,020
where it's like because I'm like the

00:48:32,860 --> 00:48:36,160
most verbal of the technical people in

00:48:35,020 --> 00:48:38,560
my initiative I kind of ended up

00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:40,720
shoehorned into this role and I'm bad at

00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:43,870
it I'm an introvert it exhaust or not oh

00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:45,160
I so am honey like I after this after

00:48:43,870 --> 00:48:47,800
talking like this I will go in like hide

00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:50,410
under my covers for hours it's so if it

00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:52,450
is so so so helpful just be able to say

00:48:50,410 --> 00:48:54,670
there are these like things that I need

00:48:52,450 --> 00:48:56,980
to do and I don't know this like being

00:48:54,670 --> 00:48:58,750
available for an initiative owners just

00:48:56,980 --> 00:49:00,520
brain dump at you and like take those

00:48:58,750 --> 00:49:01,990
pieces of information be like oh here's

00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:03,360
a task I'll take that off your plate is

00:49:01,990 --> 00:49:05,730
huge so if you have

00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:08,430
of any of that kind of skill please talk

00:49:05,730 --> 00:49:10,080
to Shannon talk to me like think think

00:49:08,430 --> 00:49:12,330
about the dribble 9 cycle and say could

00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:14,550
I could i spare two hours a week to do

00:49:12,330 --> 00:49:16,080
this for someone and just like say hmm

00:49:14,550 --> 00:49:17,550
I'll help you find people to do the

00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:19,110
tasks you need that would be amazing I

00:49:17,550 --> 00:49:21,810
really think that every initiative team

00:49:19,110 --> 00:49:23,640
should have the project manager and you

00:49:21,810 --> 00:49:25,530
know someone who's in charge of finding

00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:27,630
people to mentor other people and take

00:49:25,530 --> 00:49:29,190
the care of that back and experts can

00:49:27,630 --> 00:49:31,080
really help with that too not just pms

00:49:29,190 --> 00:49:34,710
if you're you know working in the cork

00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:36,780
use chances are that you've seen someone

00:49:34,710 --> 00:49:39,420
do something or say something that

00:49:36,780 --> 00:49:42,060
you're like whoa that dude smart and

00:49:39,420 --> 00:49:44,910
that is nice for you to be able to

00:49:42,060 --> 00:49:47,190
escalate that up to the next you know

00:49:44,910 --> 00:49:49,740
group of people whether it's that block

00:49:47,190 --> 00:49:51,990
of 4 or 5 or however many initiative

00:49:49,740 --> 00:49:54,060
owners and say hey I saw so and so do

00:49:51,990 --> 00:49:56,190
this I see potential there and then

00:49:54,060 --> 00:49:58,350
maybe you just put them next to a core

00:49:56,190 --> 00:50:00,420
mentor or a PM for a little while and

00:49:58,350 --> 00:50:02,280
get them working on stuff and then they

00:50:00,420 --> 00:50:05,850
become an expert and then they tell two

00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:07,980
friends and they tell two friends that's

00:50:05,850 --> 00:50:09,480
what I think ultimately would be really

00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:11,790
amazing if that happened and what would

00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:13,790
be even better is if those experts are

00:50:11,790 --> 00:50:16,800
not just learning the stuff but then

00:50:13,790 --> 00:50:18,900
writing down and helping create training

00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:22,320
material for people that come after them

00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:25,530
hence ladders initiative would be so so

00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:27,690
so so my dream come true because then

00:50:25,530 --> 00:50:30,120
not only are people within the system

00:50:27,690 --> 00:50:31,650
helping to bring other people up but

00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:33,180
we're also helping to make sure there's

00:50:31,650 --> 00:50:35,250
an infrastructure and a way for people

00:50:33,180 --> 00:50:37,290
to keep learning and going on and doing

00:50:35,250 --> 00:50:39,510
this stuff instead of wow i just spent

00:50:37,290 --> 00:50:41,070
you know the last month worth working on

00:50:39,510 --> 00:50:42,540
core i feel like i've learned so much I

00:50:41,070 --> 00:50:43,980
feel so good about myself but I can't

00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:46,500
help anybody else without being like

00:50:43,980 --> 00:50:48,270
where do I start when you're learning

00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:50,520
this stuff is a great way for you to

00:50:48,270 --> 00:50:51,870
kind of journal your experience this is

00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:53,820
what I'm learning this is where I'm

00:50:51,870 --> 00:50:56,040
going with this and then people after

00:50:53,820 --> 00:50:59,250
you will all benefit from that because

00:50:56,040 --> 00:51:00,600
everybody starts at some point and you

00:50:59,250 --> 00:51:02,460
know you have to be able to pick up

00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:04,680
somewhere and the mentors are trying to

00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:06,870
do this and there are a small group of

00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:08,460
amazing people doing it but I mean if we

00:51:06,870 --> 00:51:10,700
all pitched in they could get a lot more

00:51:08,460 --> 00:51:10,700
done

00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:19,190
mmm hi I think there's been a lot of

00:51:15,930 --> 00:51:22,670
great discussion about communication and

00:51:19,190 --> 00:51:24,870
momentum and empowering people and

00:51:22,670 --> 00:51:26,910
having this structure that allows people

00:51:24,870 --> 00:51:30,030
to become empowered one thing I wanted

00:51:26,910 --> 00:51:31,140
to ask is this is a bit of a different

00:51:30,030 --> 00:51:32,310
subject but I think also related to

00:51:31,140 --> 00:51:36,150
project management in general and

00:51:32,310 --> 00:51:37,320
someone mentioned scope earlier is what

00:51:36,150 --> 00:51:39,600
can project management teach us about

00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:41,100
setting goals and I know we don't we

00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:44,610
don't want to say no to anyone we want

00:51:41,100 --> 00:51:49,710
to encourage a lot of things but you

00:51:44,610 --> 00:51:52,140
know there have been situations that

00:51:49,710 --> 00:51:53,580
I've involved in where maybe there

00:51:52,140 --> 00:51:55,140
wasn't a set of clear goals and we're

00:51:53,580 --> 00:51:56,910
kind of focusing on the nuts and bolts

00:51:55,140 --> 00:51:58,320
and whether those nuts and bolts

00:51:56,910 --> 00:51:59,940
corresponds to certain criteria that

00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:01,860
we've set out for ourselves whether

00:51:59,940 --> 00:52:03,630
those are part of a scope I'm wondering

00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:05,970
what can project management teach us

00:52:03,630 --> 00:52:09,210
about that and how does that fit into

00:52:05,970 --> 00:52:13,080
some of these ideas for the future so

00:52:09,210 --> 00:52:14,970
that we can maybe I guess focus effort a

00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:16,140
bit better and not prevent people from

00:52:14,970 --> 00:52:17,400
doing things but make sure that they're

00:52:16,140 --> 00:52:20,340
doing things in the right way and how do

00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:21,660
we teach you know experts and developers

00:52:20,340 --> 00:52:23,760
and initiative owners and kind of

00:52:21,660 --> 00:52:26,040
everyone in the site cycle to focus on

00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:27,930
goals and what is what is the project

00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:30,900
management help us with that I think

00:52:27,930 --> 00:52:34,170
this is where the PM's can help everyone

00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:37,920
shine one thing that tends to happen and

00:52:34,170 --> 00:52:41,460
these big tough projects is you get

00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:43,800
fixated on an issue and sometimes you

00:52:41,460 --> 00:52:45,810
just need someone to you know knock down

00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:48,570
all the bowling pins and say look you're

00:52:45,810 --> 00:52:50,880
fixating but here's what you're trying

00:52:48,570 --> 00:52:53,880
to accomplish let's all come back to the

00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:57,330
light please I feel like that's that's

00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:58,800
what PM's try to do and sometimes we're

00:52:57,330 --> 00:53:00,330
successful sometimes we're not sometimes

00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:02,640
really the nuts and bolts need to be

00:53:00,330 --> 00:53:05,100
talked about but that also reminds me of

00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:07,550
the the crab and the cereal guy picture

00:53:05,100 --> 00:53:07,550
that I had up

00:53:13,079 --> 00:53:22,150
I feel like that's this is where Pam's

00:53:17,980 --> 00:53:24,880
can help where the initiative you know

00:53:22,150 --> 00:53:27,940
expert is saying no you have to do this

00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:29,319
otherwise it doesn't make sense and the

00:53:27,940 --> 00:53:31,779
other person trying to contribute trying

00:53:29,319 --> 00:53:33,819
to help is in their group of course does

00:53:31,779 --> 00:53:35,079
we can do it this way but maybe they're

00:53:33,819 --> 00:53:38,230
missing some critical piece of knowledge

00:53:35,079 --> 00:53:39,910
and that's when I think PM's step in a

00:53:38,230 --> 00:53:42,010
lot and say look you're both

00:53:39,910 --> 00:53:44,200
accomplishing the same goal you're just

00:53:42,010 --> 00:53:46,569
not agreeing on this one issue and if

00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:49,150
you could just find a way to explain or

00:53:46,569 --> 00:53:51,069
document your approaches that not only

00:53:49,150 --> 00:53:53,079
will you be informed but everyone else

00:53:51,069 --> 00:53:54,490
looking at this issue after and everyone

00:53:53,079 --> 00:53:57,039
who's commenting or whatever will know

00:53:54,490 --> 00:53:58,990
what you're talking about and instead of

00:53:57,039 --> 00:54:01,240
having a debate between two people the

00:53:58,990 --> 00:54:03,490
p.m. will change that environment to go

00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:05,799
right now what you're thinking and put

00:54:03,490 --> 00:54:07,319
it out there and then everyone knows so

00:54:05,799 --> 00:54:10,089
that comes back to communication and

00:54:07,319 --> 00:54:12,309
pretty soon consensus forms just

00:54:10,089 --> 00:54:14,619
organically through the information the

00:54:12,309 --> 00:54:16,150
sharing of what's happening so that's

00:54:14,619 --> 00:54:18,420
what I would love to see happen a lot

00:54:16,150 --> 00:54:24,849
more does that answer your question I

00:54:18,420 --> 00:54:28,319
hope it did hi whitefield API maintainer

00:54:24,849 --> 00:54:32,770
am speaking here as one of the guys

00:54:28,319 --> 00:54:35,049
being like with her crap hat and pouring

00:54:32,770 --> 00:54:37,359
lots and lots and lots and lots of hours

00:54:35,049 --> 00:54:43,869
throughout the the gordie seven and

00:54:37,359 --> 00:54:45,789
eight cycle and finding out that yeah

00:54:43,869 --> 00:54:49,420
it's like I'm at a point where it's

00:54:45,789 --> 00:54:51,730
hardly sustainable and one one thing I'd

00:54:49,420 --> 00:54:54,069
like to point out is the fact that so

00:54:51,730 --> 00:54:59,500
we're reasoning on initiatives which is

00:54:54,069 --> 00:55:02,770
a new gate concept right new ticket on

00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:05,049
it is a good thing and then again I've

00:55:02,770 --> 00:55:08,559
been like for the best you're as

00:55:05,049 --> 00:55:10,630
spending something like half time job on

00:55:08,559 --> 00:55:13,029
something that is not an initiative it

00:55:10,630 --> 00:55:15,430
doesn't exist at the beginning of the

00:55:13,029 --> 00:55:18,760
well it would have been at an initiative

00:55:15,430 --> 00:55:20,859
in g7 because it was unidentified let's

00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:21,829
do this this should happen less let's

00:55:20,859 --> 00:55:23,809
make it happen

00:55:21,829 --> 00:55:26,900
but we don't didn't formalize things

00:55:23,809 --> 00:55:29,329
that initiatives back then and then at

00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:32,299
the beginning of the d8 cycle okay Phil

00:55:29,329 --> 00:55:37,099
API what do you have like what's the

00:55:32,299 --> 00:55:38,869
backlog now you know no we will stay

00:55:37,099 --> 00:55:42,319
quiet during this cycle and that's very

00:55:38,869 --> 00:55:44,569
very very much not what happened because

00:55:42,319 --> 00:55:49,479
because there were other initiatives

00:55:44,569 --> 00:55:54,259
like identifying new major changes and

00:55:49,479 --> 00:56:01,059
any critical core component needs to

00:55:54,259 --> 00:56:04,400
adapt and so cmi services multilingual

00:56:01,059 --> 00:56:07,400
entity API which by the way was not an

00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:09,739
initiative either and no recently before

00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:11,239
yeah for and the reasons for why it

00:56:09,739 --> 00:56:13,729
wasn't an initiative might be

00:56:11,239 --> 00:56:15,469
interesting and I mean I'm not aware i'm

00:56:13,729 --> 00:56:18,229
not certain of those but it might be

00:56:15,469 --> 00:56:20,900
interesting and I my take on this I

00:56:18,229 --> 00:56:23,029
suspect it might be because when we

00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:24,650
identified initiatives it was about okay

00:56:23,029 --> 00:56:29,449
who has something he wants to promote

00:56:24,650 --> 00:56:31,640
and it was packed as and one wants to

00:56:29,449 --> 00:56:35,900
commit as well he act as a project

00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:38,959
manager and well if you if I had been

00:56:35,900 --> 00:56:42,170
asked like well no I have no backlog and

00:56:38,959 --> 00:56:44,989
no I don't intend on project managing it

00:56:42,170 --> 00:56:47,059
and I guess well there was a backlog

00:56:44,989 --> 00:56:50,180
fall on the NT tapi side I'm not sure

00:56:47,059 --> 00:56:54,440
that the technical guys in charge of

00:56:50,180 --> 00:56:56,180
that had the wheel to act as well to do

00:56:54,440 --> 00:57:00,170
the job that Larry did to do the job

00:56:56,180 --> 00:57:02,539
that Gabe rotted and and which from the

00:57:00,170 --> 00:57:06,109
outside looked like it took an insane

00:57:02,539 --> 00:57:08,869
amount it did yes and so there there was

00:57:06,109 --> 00:57:11,779
not this will to commit to that and I'll

00:57:08,869 --> 00:57:14,239
make that happen and deal with it and

00:57:11,779 --> 00:57:17,779
manage that throughout the whole whole

00:57:14,239 --> 00:57:21,140
cycle so yeah the so the notion of

00:57:17,779 --> 00:57:22,279
initiative is a good tool to have then

00:57:21,140 --> 00:57:25,130
again it doesn't cover everything

00:57:22,279 --> 00:57:28,160
because by the mere fact that you're

00:57:25,130 --> 00:57:30,469
maintaining an existing system we have

00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:32,410
to acknowledge the fact that it's at

00:57:30,469 --> 00:57:36,240
least a part time job

00:57:32,410 --> 00:57:38,980
yeah you're making the point of the

00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:40,420
multi-faceted team because right now

00:57:38,980 --> 00:57:42,550
they're doing that because they don't

00:57:40,420 --> 00:57:44,290
have any other choice like this is they

00:57:42,550 --> 00:57:46,240
were asked do you want to lead this

00:57:44,290 --> 00:57:49,120
initiative and they said yes and they're

00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:51,310
all brave soldiers and it's amazing but

00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:53,410
if they didn't have to have a part time

00:57:51,310 --> 00:57:54,850
job doing that they probably wouldn't

00:57:53,410 --> 00:57:57,850
like if we could have four or five

00:57:54,850 --> 00:58:01,060
people leading the charge like views did

00:57:57,850 --> 00:58:03,370
and a couple of others did that the

00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:06,160
burden of having to be the sole person

00:58:03,370 --> 00:58:08,950
with all the knowledge and insight would

00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:11,110
just sort of fade a little and it would

00:58:08,950 --> 00:58:12,640
become a team working together that's

00:58:11,110 --> 00:58:15,820
what we want to do this is this is

00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:23,440
you're making my point thank you do I

00:58:15,820 --> 00:58:31,480
need to take a picture oh just for me

00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:34,030
just for me no tweeting okay my son my

00:58:31,480 --> 00:58:37,090
second point well this brings me to yeah

00:58:34,030 --> 00:58:39,870
funding funding is like we need to

00:58:37,090 --> 00:58:45,340
acknowledge that it's a real job and

00:58:39,870 --> 00:58:52,320
like I really don't understand that it's

00:58:45,340 --> 00:58:56,800
it's not a much more frequent thing that

00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:59,290
yeah businesses need to fund global and

00:58:56,800 --> 00:59:01,600
the thing is that also we don't have a

00:58:59,290 --> 00:59:03,250
clear channel for that now no we do not

00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:04,780
I'll do another session in Austin not

00:59:03,250 --> 00:59:06,970
just that I think cuz I feel like that's

00:59:04,780 --> 00:59:11,200
a whole can of worms that I really want

00:59:06,970 --> 00:59:13,630
to open yeah hi I never understood the

00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:15,970
argument about the ga not beam in being

00:59:13,630 --> 00:59:18,280
able to collect funds for that like the

00:59:15,970 --> 00:59:20,020
DA is not allowed to ionize the

00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:22,180
development of Drupal it this is not

00:59:20,020 --> 00:59:24,850
what it would do it was just channel

00:59:22,180 --> 00:59:27,310
fundings and but the DA would not be in

00:59:24,850 --> 00:59:30,130
charge of directing the phone right well

00:59:27,310 --> 00:59:33,520
he who talks money opens up all kinds of

00:59:30,130 --> 00:59:37,150
questions I'm less familiar with how

00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:39,190
linux does does it but I think we needed

00:59:37,150 --> 00:59:44,500
a single point of entry like a not very

00:59:39,190 --> 00:59:45,430
much identified organization fund that

00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:47,410
organization

00:59:45,430 --> 00:59:48,940
and we'll make things happen with

00:59:47,410 --> 00:59:51,099
communication and transparency about

00:59:48,940 --> 00:59:53,200
which which projects are supposed to

00:59:51,099 --> 00:59:55,359
happen but we need something like that

00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:57,520
and I don't see who else than the DA or

00:59:55,359 --> 00:59:59,710
we create something else I don't know

00:59:57,520 --> 01:00:01,869
the other thing is that so you mentioned

00:59:59,710 --> 01:00:03,069
Alex I mention that Portland just have

01:00:01,869 --> 01:00:05,140
before you move on to the next thing

01:00:03,069 --> 01:00:07,180
when we had this talk in Portland

01:00:05,140 --> 01:00:09,250
someone said well you know it's not that

01:00:07,180 --> 01:00:11,380
hard to create an entity that can accept

01:00:09,250 --> 01:00:13,540
money someone should just do it and back

01:00:11,380 --> 01:00:14,980
my mind up going that would be cool but

01:00:13,540 --> 01:00:16,720
then there's all the other questions

01:00:14,980 --> 01:00:19,750
that I just asked that kind of

01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:22,750
management so I mean it it's a it's a

01:00:19,750 --> 01:00:24,069
prickly issue that I don't think is

01:00:22,750 --> 01:00:26,079
going to get solved overnight or we

01:00:24,069 --> 01:00:28,720
would have solved it already but I agree

01:00:26,079 --> 01:00:31,059
with you that funding groups is going to

01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:33,760
create a lot of goodness and a lot of

01:00:31,059 --> 01:00:35,319
stability and I think that it's um it's

01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:37,869
definitely what we should strive to for

01:00:35,319 --> 01:00:40,089
the next cycle now if we're going to do

01:00:37,869 --> 01:00:42,099
it I think in that in a very short term

01:00:40,089 --> 01:00:44,200
we're going to have to have ideas of how

01:00:42,099 --> 01:00:46,510
that can happen and I think that that

01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:48,670
deserves a lot of conversation and a lot

01:00:46,510 --> 01:00:50,470
of thought because when you're dealing

01:00:48,670 --> 01:00:53,319
with those financial issues you can

01:00:50,470 --> 01:00:55,299
really fall into a lot of traps and I

01:00:53,319 --> 01:00:57,160
think I don't want to put I don't want

01:00:55,299 --> 01:00:58,450
people turning away from initiatives and

01:00:57,160 --> 01:01:01,869
I don't want people turning away from

01:00:58,450 --> 01:01:03,790
Drupal because of money issues but it's

01:01:01,869 --> 01:01:06,579
such a good question last thing because

01:01:03,790 --> 01:01:10,960
I been speaking too much die we so get

01:01:06,579 --> 01:01:15,339
hip get tip and Alex port has an in well

01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:18,790
any important and not sufficient funding

01:01:15,339 --> 01:01:21,250
amount which he did aee collected all by

01:01:18,790 --> 01:01:23,500
himself and by virtue of other people in

01:01:21,250 --> 01:01:25,839
the communities at Yale please help Alex

01:01:23,500 --> 01:01:29,950
and that was important and it's

01:01:25,839 --> 01:01:31,690
significant and it's not enough and for

01:01:29,950 --> 01:01:34,630
the rest of the committee it might be a

01:01:31,690 --> 01:01:38,440
good model for country module authors

01:01:34,630 --> 01:01:41,440
like hey I'm i made views please help me

01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:44,380
if marine of care if Alma is had get tip

01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:46,410
back then I think views and panels

01:01:44,380 --> 01:01:49,359
development might have been more

01:01:46,410 --> 01:01:52,359
sustainable it's different for core well

01:01:49,359 --> 01:01:54,220
you don't have a project page on

01:01:52,359 --> 01:01:56,369
drupal.org staying I'm the main thing

01:01:54,220 --> 01:01:59,369
and I'm the provider of this module

01:01:56,369 --> 01:02:02,910
so core needs to be seen as a more as a

01:01:59,369 --> 01:02:06,240
team and it should be cuz it's never

01:02:02,910 --> 01:02:09,299
just one person doing it yeah and and if

01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:11,190
we want to go with get tip I I I would

01:02:09,299 --> 01:02:13,680
tend to think we should really go for it

01:02:11,190 --> 01:02:16,890
and make it a much more prone prominent

01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:19,950
that like for now it's the official way

01:02:16,890 --> 01:02:23,069
of funding Drupal development promote it

01:02:19,950 --> 01:02:25,499
on the front page of do promote it on on

01:02:23,069 --> 01:02:27,269
on youtube user profiles maybe I don't

01:02:25,499 --> 01:02:30,509
know signatures in in comments I

01:02:27,269 --> 01:02:32,130
something I like that idea i'm using

01:02:30,509 --> 01:02:34,769
infrastructure that exists and then

01:02:32,130 --> 01:02:37,499
using do to promote it instead of trying

01:02:34,769 --> 01:02:39,180
to change the way that the DA is built

01:02:37,499 --> 01:02:41,130
in order to serve a purpose that's a

01:02:39,180 --> 01:02:42,269
great idea but is it okay if I cut you

01:02:41,130 --> 01:02:43,799
off so that I can get to other people

01:02:42,269 --> 01:02:46,589
because we're running out of time thank

01:02:43,799 --> 01:02:50,519
you so much two bite-sized things one

01:02:46,589 --> 01:02:53,069
get tipped up or I think / for / Drupal

01:02:50,519 --> 01:02:55,470
go there if there's someone who makes

01:02:53,069 --> 01:02:57,450
your life easier give them a quarter

01:02:55,470 --> 01:03:00,269
every week it's not going to cost you

01:02:57,450 --> 01:03:03,480
anything sacrifice your Friday cookie

01:03:00,269 --> 01:03:05,640
and you know pay someone who's made your

01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:08,130
life easier by spending a huge amount of

01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:09,569
time you know like half of his life to

01:03:08,130 --> 01:03:12,779
give you free software right and then

01:03:09,569 --> 01:03:16,019
that leads up to um yeah I just wanted

01:03:12,779 --> 01:03:17,489
to underscore Eve and and Sasha over

01:03:16,019 --> 01:03:19,049
here like the amount of work that they

01:03:17,489 --> 01:03:21,180
had to do with the enemy and field API

01:03:19,049 --> 01:03:23,940
in Drupal is freaking ridiculous and

01:03:21,180 --> 01:03:26,160
they didn't have an did this this

01:03:23,940 --> 01:03:28,230
figurehead initiative promoted thing to

01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:30,450
do it they just freaking did it and so

01:03:28,230 --> 01:03:32,489
we we do need an way to support that

01:03:30,450 --> 01:03:35,700
sort of like low level please don't take

01:03:32,489 --> 01:03:43,559
a picture of me yeah get tip yeah get

01:03:35,700 --> 01:03:50,009
tip / for / Drupal know for for-4 you

01:03:43,559 --> 01:03:52,440
know fo r / Drupal yeah okay and make

01:03:50,009 --> 01:03:54,509
sure that link actually works um so yeah

01:03:52,440 --> 01:03:56,190
I think that I look forward to finding

01:03:54,509 --> 01:03:57,869
ways that we can and I think this is

01:03:56,190 --> 01:04:00,150
where like the the core developer on

01:03:57,869 --> 01:04:02,880
staff model comes in is like finding

01:04:00,150 --> 01:04:04,829
people who can contribute to those api's

01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:06,989
and finding ways that we can fund like

01:04:04,829 --> 01:04:09,660
Alec spots another example like he he's

01:04:06,989 --> 01:04:09,900
working on cmi but and he is now but the

01:04:09,660 --> 01:04:11,190
work

01:04:09,900 --> 01:04:13,500
soon as a core maintainer is completely

01:04:11,190 --> 01:04:15,000
above and beyond that um so that's what

01:04:13,500 --> 01:04:17,700
i want to say they're not an initiative

01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:20,970
and they you know initiatives are about

01:04:17,700 --> 01:04:22,170
like new features new right but there's

01:04:20,970 --> 01:04:23,309
also a lot of work that needs to be done

01:04:22,170 --> 01:04:25,380
that doesn't really fit meet me in that

01:04:23,309 --> 01:04:26,730
box and we should applaud that and you

01:04:25,380 --> 01:04:28,829
should you should give them a cup of

01:04:26,730 --> 01:04:29,700
coffee at least and tell your company to

01:04:28,829 --> 01:04:31,559
give them more than a cup of coffee

01:04:29,700 --> 01:04:33,869
because every single person design rooms

01:04:31,559 --> 01:04:38,960
in some way has some investment in

01:04:33,869 --> 01:04:41,339
Drupal so I am a you know a weekly beer

01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:43,470
alright last question that I have to

01:04:41,339 --> 01:04:45,779
probably give someone else the podium oh

01:04:43,470 --> 01:04:50,579
dear all right speaking as an initiative

01:04:45,779 --> 01:04:51,990
lead I'll stick to the mic I can say the

01:04:50,579 --> 01:04:55,400
biggest things that I've been missing

01:04:51,990 --> 01:04:57,359
for the entirety of Drupal 8 are

01:04:55,400 --> 01:05:00,569
predictable timeline predictable

01:04:57,359 --> 01:05:01,710
resources it is impossible to plan if

01:05:00,569 --> 01:05:03,029
you don't know how long you have and you

01:05:01,710 --> 01:05:05,430
don't know what resources you have I

01:05:03,029 --> 01:05:06,809
don't know one week to the next what my

01:05:05,430 --> 01:05:10,680
time is going to be to work on something

01:05:06,809 --> 01:05:12,150
or anyone else which means you know any

01:05:10,680 --> 01:05:15,390
time I have a block of time to work on

01:05:12,150 --> 01:05:17,609
core do I review patches do I write a

01:05:15,390 --> 01:05:19,260
patch do I try and document something

01:05:17,609 --> 01:05:21,359
someone else can write a patch whichever

01:05:19,260 --> 01:05:23,099
one is I'm wasting time on the other

01:05:21,359 --> 01:05:24,210
three because I don't know if I'm going

01:05:23,099 --> 01:05:26,069
to have anyone else working on them

01:05:24,210 --> 01:05:28,079
there have been a lot of other people

01:05:26,069 --> 01:05:30,089
working on whiskey dozens of people

01:05:28,079 --> 01:05:31,589
working on it some of them doing amazing

01:05:30,089 --> 01:05:34,529
things writing ten times as much code as

01:05:31,589 --> 01:05:35,670
i have but i have no idea one day to the

01:05:34,529 --> 01:05:39,869
next if they're going to be there or not

01:05:35,670 --> 01:05:41,970
and that is a huge source of stress and

01:05:39,869 --> 01:05:44,010
inability to plan for i think every

01:05:41,970 --> 01:05:46,170
initiative views did it the least bad of

01:05:44,010 --> 01:05:48,420
any of us because they actually had you

01:05:46,170 --> 01:05:51,119
know a team that had resourcing plan

01:05:48,420 --> 01:05:52,950
from the get go I don't know how you

01:05:51,119 --> 01:05:56,730
pulled it off but the rest of us need to

01:05:52,950 --> 01:05:58,680
have done so so that that's point number

01:05:56,730 --> 01:06:00,359
one predictability of what we can

01:05:58,680 --> 01:06:03,930
actually do is a prerequisite for any

01:06:00,359 --> 01:06:06,210
worthwhile planning and it has to be

01:06:03,930 --> 01:06:08,010
consistent resources too I mean I know

01:06:06,210 --> 01:06:10,020
Jess gets upset every time I say this

01:06:08,010 --> 01:06:11,910
but I'm going to keep saying it when I

01:06:10,020 --> 01:06:13,589
said when whiskey started give me five

01:06:11,910 --> 01:06:15,450
people 10 hours a week we can do

01:06:13,589 --> 01:06:17,490
whatever you want in a year give me 50

01:06:15,450 --> 01:06:20,029
people a half hour a week I can't do

01:06:17,490 --> 01:06:22,440
jack you need dedicated resources

01:06:20,029 --> 01:06:24,420
drive-bys once enough you know an hour

01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:26,790
are here and there does not accomplish

01:06:24,420 --> 01:06:28,109
core work it can do great a lot of the

01:06:26,790 --> 01:06:29,760
crowd source stuff but the core work

01:06:28,109 --> 01:06:31,800
requires dedicated resources actually

01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:35,190
have a question for you then in that

01:06:31,800 --> 01:06:38,130
line in that same vein what if it's 5050

01:06:35,190 --> 01:06:41,339
what if in the beginning you have five

01:06:38,130 --> 01:06:43,829
people for 10 hours a week and you can

01:06:41,339 --> 01:06:45,300
focus on defining the initiative what's

01:06:43,829 --> 01:06:47,849
in it how does it work what are the

01:06:45,300 --> 01:06:49,560
dependencies where could things go awry

01:06:47,849 --> 01:06:51,329
risk management is also a part of that

01:06:49,560 --> 01:06:52,829
that I think we didn't get to do it

01:06:51,329 --> 01:06:57,210
nearly enough of and it's actually

01:06:52,829 --> 01:06:59,220
pretty fun right um and that's that's

01:06:57,210 --> 01:07:02,369
one way to go and then the other half

01:06:59,220 --> 01:07:05,849
once you have a foundation that makes it

01:07:02,369 --> 01:07:08,569
really easy to make nice funding pitches

01:07:05,849 --> 01:07:12,030
and that that's how you can get

01:07:08,569 --> 01:07:13,740
businesses and people to rally to your

01:07:12,030 --> 01:07:15,780
cause by saying this is what we're doing

01:07:13,740 --> 01:07:18,839
and by the way this is how we're doing

01:07:15,780 --> 01:07:21,750
it then it's easy to get teams and

01:07:18,839 --> 01:07:25,170
hordes to join forces that are actually

01:07:21,750 --> 01:07:28,319
funded and in that way you can take your

01:07:25,170 --> 01:07:30,450
phases and fund your faces different

01:07:28,319 --> 01:07:33,930
different phases can sometimes used as

01:07:30,450 --> 01:07:41,520
the an argument i had i know with angie

01:07:33,930 --> 01:07:44,579
all the time it it wasn't until februari

01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:45,660
this year maybe march that we really got

01:07:44,579 --> 01:07:47,480
to the point on whiskey we're just

01:07:45,660 --> 01:07:50,640
architectural e we could crowdsource it

01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:52,170
250 people to work on stuff once we got

01:07:50,640 --> 01:07:53,940
there great we tried to open up to as

01:07:52,170 --> 01:07:55,319
many people as possible but the types of

01:07:53,940 --> 01:07:57,410
problems we are working on until then

01:07:55,319 --> 01:07:59,760
we're just not crowdsource full problems

01:07:57,410 --> 01:08:01,829
once we got to that point great let's do

01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:04,079
that but yeah the certain problems

01:08:01,829 --> 01:08:06,510
require five people ten hours a week not

01:08:04,079 --> 01:08:08,940
50 people an hour a week and we have to

01:08:06,510 --> 01:08:10,950
understand which is which so basically

01:08:08,940 --> 01:08:13,500
it's possible but it depends on the

01:08:10,950 --> 01:08:14,700
initiative and then like the complexity

01:08:13,500 --> 01:08:16,710
of what you're trying to do not just the

01:08:14,700 --> 01:08:19,739
initiative it depends on we said whiskey

01:08:16,710 --> 01:08:21,750
is a little of each it depends on the

01:08:19,739 --> 01:08:23,699
problem space at hand 50 people

01:08:21,750 --> 01:08:26,790
crowdsourcing on rewriting the core

01:08:23,699 --> 01:08:28,770
router is a terrible idea five people

01:08:26,790 --> 01:08:31,380
trying to do all of the page callback

01:08:28,770 --> 01:08:34,069
conversions is a terrible idea so you

01:08:31,380 --> 01:08:36,270
need to match the process up to the task

01:08:34,069 --> 01:08:38,460
hey guys I think we ran over

01:08:36,270 --> 01:08:46,109
but this was really cool thank you so

01:08:38,460 --> 01:08:48,150
much I give just one of the talk come

01:08:46,109 --> 01:08:49,980
come see me the Commerce guys booth if

01:08:48,150 --> 01:08:51,150
you want to continue conversation now

01:08:49,980 --> 01:08:53,490
and again I'm going to be in meetings

01:08:51,150 --> 01:08:55,500
but I'm very interested in talking with

01:08:53,490 --> 01:08:57,630
you and getting to know you and I

01:08:55,500 --> 01:08:59,880
conversation on Thursday last session is

01:08:57,630 --> 01:09:02,400
on to release cycle oh wait say that

01:08:59,880 --> 01:09:04,710
again Larry my core conversation

01:09:02,400 --> 01:09:06,270
Thursday last session is on core release

01:09:04,710 --> 01:09:07,950
cycle which dovetails with an awful lot

01:09:06,270 --> 01:09:10,710
of his stuff that's really good one to

01:09:07,950 --> 01:09:13,010
not miss Thursday last session go see
