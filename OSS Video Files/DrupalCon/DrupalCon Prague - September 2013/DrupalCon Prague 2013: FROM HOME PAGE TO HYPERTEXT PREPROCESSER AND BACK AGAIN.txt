Title: DrupalCon Prague 2013: FROM HOME PAGE TO HYPERTEXT PREPROCESSER AND BACK AGAIN
Publication date: 2013-09-26
Playlist: DrupalCon Prague - September 2013
Description: 
	Cryptic title? Then check out the origins of the acronym "PHP". At this year's Drupalcon, the air will be filled with talk of "the next big thing" -- the magic of Drupal 8, e-commerce, big data, responsive design -- the list is long. But perhaps it's time to step back a bit and examine our origins. Maybe our FIRST big thing -- the personal home page - needs to become our NEXT big thing.

Our community to revisit the needs of the user, not just those of the device. The more we focus on technological innovation, the less attention we pay to the social and political consequences of our work.

In this presentation, I'll propose a three-step method for using our technology to provide truly personal home pages (for desktop and handheld devices alike). And not just for the end user. What can we do to meet the needs of those who are administering the backend? How can we help content providers? What can we do to improve personalization?

In short, I'll show how we must work to put non-developers back into the equation and thus make Drupal even stronger!

features that go into tuple a and even

00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:16,260
call them our tools but as as our tools

00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,970

powerful tools it becomes even more

00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:24,600
important to look at what did we build

00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,609
with those tools and how do we do it and

00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,960
why do we do it so that's why I'm very

realize you know foregoing coffees like

00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:26,369
that's kind of a big thing at

00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:28,590
conferences this morning I just so I can

00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:30,930
figure out how to do this talk let me

00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:35,400
ask you a few questions how many of you

00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:38,790
are developers okay and how many of you

00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:40,920
consider yourself to the designers okay

00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:47,820
about half and half how many of you have

00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:49,770
a hangover all right when you call

00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:54,119
yourself developers and we're in the

00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:56,430
front end track what front end are you

00:01:54,119 --> 00:02:00,930
referring to are you referring to the

00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:03,810
front end the Drupal gives to its users

00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:07,350
or to the websites that are being

00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:10,530
produced using Drupal the people who are

00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:12,590
creating those and the final result

00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:12,590
you

00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:22,099
did you understand the question okay

00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:23,450
there you can you can design two kinds

00:02:22,099 --> 00:02:25,910
of front-end the front end the people

00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:29,330
like me see because I'm a user of the

00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:31,310
web or the front end that it for example

00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:33,470
in Drupal 8 with you know the various

00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:36,890
best practices that have been built into

00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:38,860
it the WYSIWYG editor and so on so when

00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:41,930
you develop front-end are you developing

00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:44,930
wysiwyg editors for drupal and similar

00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:48,769
things or are you designing websites you

00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:56,870
building websites excuse me building

00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:59,620
websites okay good um how many of you

00:02:56,870 --> 00:03:02,720
are over 50 is anyone here over 50 Oh

00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:04,610
couple of us and we admit to it then you

00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:08,030
remember when we were doing development

00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:10,970
back in the 1970s we had we had a card

00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:13,790
deck and we we had all these punch cards

00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:15,709
and we at least in my university we give

00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:17,330
them to somebody who sat behind a little

00:03:15,709 --> 00:03:19,010
window and then the next day we could

00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:20,870
find out that the program crashed on

00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:24,530
card 27 and you'd have to try and figure

00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:27,829
out okay what went wrong I we talked

00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:29,299
about PowerPoint decks in the same way

00:03:27,829 --> 00:03:32,000
we talked about programmed ex in the old

00:03:29,299 --> 00:03:33,950
day well I decided that for today I'm

00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,350
actually going to have a deck so all of

00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:42,440
you over in the cheap seats nothing's

00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:44,180
going to happen on that screen I don't

00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:48,230
want to disturb them they're busy

00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:52,010
apparently I so I had some questions

00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:54,170
those were them the three reasons I

00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:56,060
shouldn't be here the first is I don't

00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:58,670
actually have a degree in HCI or

00:03:56,060 --> 00:04:03,549
anything else that's moderately relevant

00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:06,079
I haven't coded anything in 25 years and

00:04:03,549 --> 00:04:10,579
perhaps the worst admission of all is

00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:12,019
I've never built anything in Drupal so

00:04:10,579 --> 00:04:15,980
of course you say well so why the hell

00:04:12,019 --> 00:04:17,450
is he here well I for one I wrote one of

00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:20,989
the very first commercial programs for

00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:23,510
the Apple to back in 1979 i guess it was

00:04:20,989 --> 00:04:25,280
i wrote a CMS back in nineteen

00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:28,620
eighty-four so that i could do the first

00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:31,710
danish language adventure game

00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:33,570
but more important I was also chairman

00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:37,169
of cicor for a while we won't talk about

00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:39,600
that I but more importantly I am a user

00:04:37,169 --> 00:04:42,870
i'm i'm the guy who goes in and tries to

00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:46,050
break things and tries to optimize the

00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:47,550
user experience for our clients and this

00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:51,150
is kind of what i'd like to talk to you

00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:53,220
about today the three purposes for this

00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:56,250
talk first I want you to think

00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:58,380
differently about about your work and

00:04:56,250 --> 00:05:00,210
what you're doing I want of course to

00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:03,240
build the Drupal community and finally I

00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:05,310
want one to help increase the joy of

00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:06,600
using the Drupal product and certainly a

00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:11,160
lot of very good things are happening

00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:13,440
with Drupal number eight i also have

00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:16,050
three steps that i want to describe to

00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,970
you that i think will help you look at

00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:19,560
your jobs a little differently than you

00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:21,389
did when you came in this morning at

00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:23,070
least i hope so i'm going to tell you a

00:05:21,389 --> 00:05:25,590
lot of stories and some of them you'll

00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:32,490
say well this is irrelevant to me others

00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:37,080
maybe not so irrelevant drupal the drop

00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:40,830
the droplet originally was a PHP program

00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:43,650
and PHP stands for personal homepage now

00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:46,349
somewhere along the line we got into

00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:48,270
hypertext preprocessor and I'm honestly

00:05:46,349 --> 00:05:50,940
not quite sure what the hell a hyper

00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:52,849
says preprocessor is you know if you

00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:55,380
have a cake mixer is that a cake

00:05:52,849 --> 00:05:57,860
preprocessor i mean i don't know maybe

00:05:55,380 --> 00:06:00,150
the chicken is an ingredient

00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:02,220
preprocessor because it lays eggs I

00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:04,650
think there's some strange terms that

00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:06,750
get used in there pretty geeky terms at

00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:09,419
that and that's something that has a

00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:12,330
tendency to turn off people who are

00:06:09,419 --> 00:06:15,030
genuinely interested in using your

00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:17,400
product but can't quite figure out the

00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:19,710
terminology that's being used they can't

00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:21,120
quite figure out the code drupal 8 of

00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:24,740
course is going to do marvelous things

00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:29,820
to move things in a new direction but

00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:33,180
drew bleeding out there yet it's it's an

00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:34,529
important that we that we do try and

00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:37,169
make things easy

00:06:34,529 --> 00:06:39,209
for the people who are using our product

00:06:37,169 --> 00:06:41,819
and also the people who are using the

00:06:39,209 --> 00:06:43,349
website and the trees kind of scared the

00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:45,329
 out of me when he started because

00:06:43,349 --> 00:06:47,369
he said well you know we want to ask why

00:06:45,329 --> 00:06:48,779
and that is exactly the critical

00:06:47,369 --> 00:06:51,959
question and we're going to talk a lot

00:06:48,779 --> 00:06:54,209
about the whys of various things this

00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:58,049
morning but he says helping individuals

00:06:54,209 --> 00:07:00,809
build their dream and I think that

00:06:58,049 --> 00:07:03,659
that's more what than a why they're

00:07:00,809 --> 00:07:05,129
building do we want to help them build

00:07:03,659 --> 00:07:13,139
or do we want to help them achieve their

00:07:05,129 --> 00:07:14,879
dream there's a huge difference there so

00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:23,309
I ask you again so why do you do what

00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:25,619
you do ye in this business is it certain

00:07:23,309 --> 00:07:29,729
money is it because you're going to save

00:07:25,619 --> 00:07:32,519
the world why do you do what you do why

00:07:29,729 --> 00:07:35,399
is Drupal a better choice than ektron or

00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:37,099
at the server or Sitecore or the other

00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:42,569
open-source things that are out there

00:07:37,099 --> 00:07:52,459
type of three I'm Barack oh.what why are

00:07:42,569 --> 00:07:52,459
you here you can talk why not okay

00:07:54,470 --> 00:08:30,960
excuse me okay no all right well that's

00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:46,320
fair enough i mean i understand how one

00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:49,890
builds CMS's okay I hear a lot of what

00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:51,870
and very little why in that I you're

00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:58,440
building a tool and you describe the

00:08:51,870 --> 00:09:00,630
tool I let me tell excuse me I pick

00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:02,580
Drupal over let's say sharepoint and the

00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:05,130
higher salaries because of the community

00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:07,170
I mean it was fun to was fun to learn it

00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:10,550
was fun to interact and I enjoyed that

00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:14,010
the tool allowed me to be disruptive to

00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:16,080
do disruptive stuff and be part of

00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:18,180
something that was up-and-coming that

00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,220
was the why I mean I enjoyed changing

00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:25,160
things instead of instead of just

00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:25,160
building on the under state of co

00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:29,730
there's nothing wrong with any of these

00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:33,020
answers I'm just trying to push you a

00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:33,020
lot further yes sir

00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:51,530
that's a very good ye Rin soon let me

00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:53,810
tell you some wise stories first of all

00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:55,880
a years ago there was a company in

00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:58,850
Denmark called time manager

00:09:55,880 --> 00:10:02,780
international and they made SAS airline

00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:06,890
of the year in 1985 and British Airways

00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:08,390
that had been privatized approached time

00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:09,470
manager and asked if they couldn't do

00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:12,230
the same thing and they were doing

00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:14,240
service design programs and I had the

00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:16,600
dubious honor of standing in Keith row

00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:19,070
airport for three days and interviewing

00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:20,780
passengers what were they expecting in

00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:22,310
terms of service from an airline and so

00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:25,880
on and there were a lot of surprises

00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:29,120
along the way oh by the way how many of

00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:30,710
you are Danish because I've heard more

00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:33,350
danish here than English or German or

00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:36,770
anything or checked for that matter now

00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:41,270
whatever who do you call them did see

00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:44,540
some wild lands fella so British Airways

00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:47,120
had had a couple of ideas they thought

00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:50,540
the why of their business was to get

00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:52,820
people from A to B it was a transport

00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:55,220
service and they approached their

00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:58,070
business as though it was a transport

00:10:55,220 --> 00:11:01,640
service and it wasn't even a very good

00:10:58,070 --> 00:11:03,410
one at that I they decided flying on

00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:06,050
time was going to be a great service

00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:08,390
parameter but the truth is the

00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:09,920
passengers got really mad if you said

00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:11,090
well flying on time isn't that a good

00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,350
thing this you know you're supposed to

00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:14,270
fly on time this is why we have

00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:16,790
schedules this is we're going we're

00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:18,770
taking your airplane because we're going

00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:20,870
to a meeting we have people meeting us

00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:24,260
at the airport we have other flights to

00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:26,300
catch you're supposed to fly on time and

00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:27,530
it turned out the service parameters for

00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:30,170
British Airways we're very very

00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:32,240
different than what any of us had

00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:36,290
anticipated and one of the reasons for

00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:39,380
this was quite simply that we didn't use

00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:41,810
british airways to get from A to B we

00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:43,520
use british airways because we wanted to

00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:46,430
go to a meeting because we were going to

00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:48,180
go on holiday it was part of a continuum

00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:51,839
that included taxis

00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:53,940
one end and a bus at the other and when

00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:55,529
British Airways suddenly realized that

00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:57,899
they were part of something much much

00:11:55,529 --> 00:11:59,490
larger they could also change the way in

00:11:57,899 --> 00:12:01,260
which they approach their markets have

00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:03,660
changed their marketing message and

00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:05,279
people started to like the airline and

00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:08,760
in fact they became the European airline

00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:13,020
of the year in 1986 so we were quite

00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:14,640
proud of them so it's really easy to

00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:17,190
make assumptions and I'm going to get

00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:20,490
back to making assumptions based on

00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:22,980
faulty data in a little while another

00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:28,910
story though is how many of you remember

00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:33,810
the creatives in it was an MP mp3 player

00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:36,029
the ok creative had really good

00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:39,240
technology they had really tweaked the

00:12:36,029 --> 00:12:42,630
mp3 algorithm and it was it was good

00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:48,779
stuff and it was at a good price point

00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:54,810
and it was marketed as a 5 gigabyte mp3

00:12:48,779 --> 00:12:57,320
player that's what it is but that's not

00:12:54,810 --> 00:13:00,570
why that's not anything that inspires

00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:02,670
confidence in the product or love for

00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:05,450
the product or builds market share it's

00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:11,220
just saying this is a great chair

00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:14,730
instead of saying this is a whatever the

00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:16,650
ipod was launched about a year later the

00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:18,330
technology wasn't as good the interface

00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:22,830
was a little questionable at least in

00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:25,709
the first the first go-round but they

00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:28,620
got to the why thousands of songs in

00:13:25,709 --> 00:13:31,560
your pocket that is a radically

00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:37,140
different message than a five gigabyte

00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:40,860
mp3 player and where is the creative zen

00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:43,290
today and where is the ipod today if you

00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:46,320
can figure out the why of drupal and

00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:48,540
communicate that both within your

00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:51,360
organization's but also to your

00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:53,100
customers and to your teams you're going

00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:55,380
to come a lot further and i think that

00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:57,300
this is one of the areas that drupal

00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:59,830
really needs to work on I spent a lot of

00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:04,300
time reading about drupal and

00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:06,580
italia it's a little hard to find the

00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:09,400
why it's a little hard to find the why

00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:12,730
and when I can't find the why I as

00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:16,240
somebody who recommends CMS systems to

00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:19,990
clients have a little trouble figuring

00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:24,370
out why I should choose your product our

00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:28,630
product over someone else's there's a

00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:30,340
third story that i'd like to know i

00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:32,320
think i'll skip that for now I say

00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:34,150
anyway let's think about the why because

00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:37,660
basically this is these are the three

00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:40,060
steps if you can figure out the why and

00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:42,790
if you understand the why of what you're

00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:45,280
doing and I like the idea of solving

00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:47,350
problems that's that's that's a that's a

00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:50,950
good starting point for working out a

00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:53,260
more sophisticated why the why will then

00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:55,150
explain the what and when you know the

00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:57,670
what then you can go out and you can do

00:14:55,150 --> 00:15:01,450
the hell it's kind of the basics of

00:14:57,670 --> 00:15:04,570
change management the senior the CEOs

00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:06,550
they they know what I'm sorry they're

00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:09,430
supposed to come with the vision the Y

00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:11,200
to lead us forward so that the middle

00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:15,070
managers can figure out the what and the

00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:17,620
frontline personnel can do the how same

00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:19,890
thing if you can figure out the why and

00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:22,000
I can't find it on the internet and

00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:24,430
unfortunately I didn't hear enough of it

00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,290
this morning but clearly the thought is

00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:28,510
there but it hasn't been crystallized

00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:30,100
yet it hasn't been formulated I don't

00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:31,840
think that we're helping people build

00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:34,390
their dream I think we're trying to help

00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:37,630
them achieve their dream and I this is

00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:39,430
not a semantic nitpicking I think it is

00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:41,590
a basic fundamental difference in the

00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:42,730
way you look at the product you're about

00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:45,400
to move from something that was very

00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:48,940
very geeky to something that is very

00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:54,790
very user-friendly I'd certainly I mean

00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:57,160
a far cry from Drupal 6 so people are

00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:58,570
going to also be making different

00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:00,430
demands of you than they have in the

00:15:58,570 --> 00:16:04,080
past there are a lot of things that are

00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:06,730
going to change my next question is how

00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:10,920
many of you actually go out in the field

00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:10,920
and watch people use Drupal

00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:25,350
some of you remarkably few do you know

00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:31,690
how people actually use what you build

00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:33,430
yes never in the way you expect thank

00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:36,340
you that was exactly what I wanted to

00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:37,990
hear now as a speaker at drupalcon see

00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:40,930
we get these we get these these these

00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:42,850
decks given to us and said this is the

00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:44,710
format this is this is what we want you

00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:47,230
to do now let me ask you why do we have

00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:54,070
a cover slide for a speaker at a

00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:55,870
conference what is why do we have it to

00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:59,230
show that you're in the right room okay

00:16:55,870 --> 00:17:00,640
what else that you're at the right

00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:04,000
conference what you were you were in

00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:09,400
doubt you thought this was web Expo just

00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:11,950
in case Oh Louis okay what so what other

00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:20,260
things would do you want to get out of

00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:21,520
that slide yes okay capturing the

00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:24,250
essence of what you want to communicate

00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:25,600
what other basic information if we're

00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:27,610
looking to look at this in terms of

00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:32,220
content strategy what do we want to be

00:17:27,610 --> 00:17:38,230
putting on that slide excuse me

00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:40,840
surprises okay because i was thinking of

00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:43,420
you know in more mundane terms like the

00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:45,070
twitter handle for the the person who's

00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:49,120
speaking the name of the person who's

00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:51,100
speaking it might also help if you did

00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:54,940
this in a typeface that could actually

00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:56,470
be read I let me tell you I actually I

00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:58,060
think I cheated because I do have a

00:17:56,470 --> 00:18:01,090
little clicker here and I do have a

00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:05,320
couple of slides this is this is the

00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:07,300
basic template so half of the page the

00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:09,430
one at the top the one that's easy to

00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:11,500
see if you've got somebody tall sitting

00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:16,570
in front of you is telling you that you

00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:18,610
were at drupalcon in Prague click the

00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:20,440
add title and click to add subtitle

00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:22,110
there is nothing about Twitter there is

00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:24,820
nothing about the name of the presenter

00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:27,070
this the typefaces are so

00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:30,870
be in this that you can't have a title

00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:30,870
that's much more in about 11 characters

00:18:32,909 --> 00:18:37,899
this is not a good template but on the

00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:40,090
other hand this is kind of the way

00:18:37,899 --> 00:18:42,130
Drupal thinking has been for an awful

00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:44,320
long time we are not thinking about the

00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:46,630
why we have these things and I'm not

00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:48,519
trying to be nasty here I'm just trying

00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:51,340
to point out that you are about you're

00:18:48,519 --> 00:18:53,440
on the cusp of a major change there's

00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:55,419
something very very exciting in your

00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:57,700
community all the stuff that Reese

00:18:55,419 --> 00:19:00,190
talked about this morning just blew me

00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:02,970
away the accessibility issues there are

00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:06,190
all kinds of things that are marvelous

00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:08,139
the WYSIWYG editor I mean as a content

00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:10,509
provider this is something that I can't

00:19:08,139 --> 00:19:12,399
wait to see and I'll tell you that you

00:19:10,509 --> 00:19:13,690
know we use site poor in my company I

00:19:12,399 --> 00:19:16,690
don't think site court necessarily

00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:21,210
follows best practices but it is what it

00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:23,769
is so we have our drupalcon thing and

00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:26,559
somebody needed to back up and say why

00:19:23,769 --> 00:19:30,610
do we do this before they start

00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:32,019
designing logos screw the logo you're

00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:33,639
not here because of their logo you're

00:19:32,019 --> 00:19:37,179
here because there's a conference to

00:19:33,639 --> 00:19:39,129
attend you want to capture the essence

00:19:37,179 --> 00:19:41,590
of what the talk is going to be back

00:19:39,129 --> 00:19:43,059
about and so on and so forth how many of

00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:46,299
you know a designer by the name of

00:19:43,059 --> 00:19:48,820
Charles Eames charles and ray eames they

00:19:46,299 --> 00:19:51,100
they did this chair which is kind of

00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:52,929
iconic this was designed for the

00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:55,629
Hollywood film director Billy Wilder who

00:19:52,929 --> 00:20:00,659
did some like it hot and and other

00:19:55,629 --> 00:20:07,149
classics Charles Eames and this goes

00:20:00,659 --> 00:20:09,190
exactly to your point say it again they

00:20:07,149 --> 00:20:14,230
never use it the way he's expected this

00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:17,710
is charles eames at a hotel in london he

00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:21,159
worked standing up so he stacks the

00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:23,200
hotel furniture so that he can work now

00:20:21,159 --> 00:20:26,529
I don't think the hotel had this in mind

00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:28,299
when they designed it how many of you

00:20:26,529 --> 00:20:32,049
are saying at the corinthia across the

00:20:28,299 --> 00:20:34,179
way ok how many of you have been

00:20:32,049 --> 00:20:35,919
fighting trying to figure out where the

00:20:34,179 --> 00:20:38,260
light sockets were that the plugs were

00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:38,890
so that you could charge things how many

00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:40,900
of you had to

00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:44,860
unplug the coffee machine so that you

00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:46,330
could charge your phone well you know

00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:48,370
the corinthia if you know the history

00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:54,010
it's a 30 year old hotel it was sort of

00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:56,590
the socialist the it was a prestige

00:20:54,010 --> 00:20:57,640
project for Czechoslovakia and it was

00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:59,590
built about the same time as the

00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:01,330
conference center here so you're not

00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:02,620
supposed to have things that you plug in

00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:04,870
and even though it's been remodeled

00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:06,520
nobody has put in extra plugs there's

00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:09,340
nowhere to plug in a computer there's

00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:10,990
nowhere to plug in a phone there's no

00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:12,310
play have they have hair dryers but

00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:15,730
there's no place to plug in a hair dryer

00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:17,530
and if you do you can't if the court is

00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:19,450
too short so you can't actually see the

00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:23,710
mirror if you've crawled underneath the

00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:25,120
desk and unplugged something else so you

00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:28,120
know it hasn't really been thought

00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:30,040
through the corinthia is marketing

00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:32,410
itself is a very modern hotel but they

00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:34,150
haven't really gotten to where they need

00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:36,100
to be there still living with some

00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:37,540
things from the past and there are going

00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:39,280
to be things from Drupal 7 that are

00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:42,520
going to live for a while but it's your

00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:45,220
job when you've defined the Y to start

00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:49,050
spotting out what needs to be done it's

00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:51,520
not just a question of patches and so

00:21:49,050 --> 00:21:54,370
you know if you don't know why you do

00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:56,410
what you do I urge you spend some time

00:21:54,370 --> 00:21:58,780
to think about this because when you got

00:21:56,410 --> 00:22:01,270
the Y you'll know what the what is and

00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:03,550
you'll know how to do it I think that

00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:05,590
too many people not just in this

00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:07,660
community but in many developer

00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:09,490
communities spend so much time thinking

00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:14,410
about the what sometimes they forget a

00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:15,820
little bit why they're there why there

00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:17,080
why they're trying to make the world a

00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:20,470
better place if they're doing that at

00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:22,960
all I have some thoughts about Drupal in

00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:25,270
general I think it's really good that

00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:28,030
Drupal has finally accepted Best of

00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:29,800
Breed products and is starting to

00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:31,720
integrate this is one of the problems we

00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:33,550
have with our CMS we had the same

00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:35,500
problem with type of three we have the

00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:37,300
same problem with sitecore they both had

00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:39,100
proprietary blogging tools and nobody

00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:40,720
ever blogs at fat duck's because nobody

00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:43,660
can remember from one time to the next

00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:44,890
how you're supposed to do it so one of

00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:46,480
the other things that you can think

00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:48,310
about before you get too terribly

00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:50,940
creative in trying to be different or

00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:53,730
whatever is that

00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:58,950
there is a logical function called ret

00:22:53,730 --> 00:23:00,330
reductive inference and that means you

00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:02,880
learn something one place and you're

00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:07,740
able to use those skills somewhere else

00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:10,200
so this is why we have we have logos

00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:12,990
that people recognize even though the

00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:14,820
logos themselves or I'm sorry icons

00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:16,410
don't seem to make sense to anybody I

00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:19,260
mean just think of all the people who

00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:21,810
gladly click on a little diskette to

00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:24,000
save their work and you sort of wonder

00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:27,720
how many of these people have even seen

00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:29,790
a disk it but we accept it as that's

00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:33,450
that's our icon of choice and that's

00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:35,130
fine because you've seen it in Microsoft

00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:36,870
you've seen it on your Apple you've seen

00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:40,620
all kinds of places I mean we've got a

00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:43,980
western electric telephone receiver

00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:46,170
designed in the 1930s by Henry Dreyfuss

00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:48,930
I mean when's the last time anybody had

00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:51,690
a telephone like this not recently but

00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:55,170
that's the icon we accept so the best

00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:57,240
breed things generally do build on retro

00:23:55,170 --> 00:23:59,280
duck of inference they they build on

00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:00,480
things that people know they can they

00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:02,790
can they can take skills that they've

00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:04,710
learned somewhere and use them somewhere

00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:06,330
else and the screenshots that I saw this

00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:08,640
morning we're really very very good

00:24:06,330 --> 00:24:10,620
because you know I could I could hit the

00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:13,140
ground running with these tools I knew

00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:16,590
how to work them I can't do that in in

00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:19,200
Drupal 7 the core is good and you need

00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:21,810
to work on that my clients tell me

00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:24,690
though I don't really get Drupal because

00:24:21,810 --> 00:24:26,250
there's this this thing at the bottom

00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:28,380
and then I've got all these these Lego

00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:31,400
blocks and I really don't know how I'm

00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:35,190
supposed to assemble a site I think that

00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:36,150
that's a misconception but it's

00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:38,100
something that you're going to have to

00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:40,560
work on so that people do understand

00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:42,930
that it's maybe not as as intimidating

00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:44,940
as they think it is when you read that

00:24:42,930 --> 00:24:48,950
there are almost 30,000 different

00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:51,990
developer modules that's kind of scary

00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:54,150
that can turn off a lot of people who

00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:58,700
are marketing directors and others who

00:24:54,150 --> 00:25:00,780
are ultimately buying your services

00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:02,520
because they don't really understand the

00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:04,350
tool they'd rather buy something

00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:05,640
proprietary because then

00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:08,640
if anything goes wrong they know who to

00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:11,330
blame it's not a very good attitude but

00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:15,030
that's the kind of thing that we hear

00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:17,370
there is a trade-off open source

00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:20,640
generally means more development time it

00:25:17,370 --> 00:25:23,910
shouldn't but it often does and a lack

00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:26,610
of accountability whereas if you buy a

00:25:23,910 --> 00:25:29,309
psych or and ektron or an episode then

00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:32,789
you you know who to talk to that the

00:25:29,309 --> 00:25:34,950
problem is they have exorbitant license

00:25:32,789 --> 00:25:37,350
fees and there's also a lot of coding in

00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:39,360
that too so you have a tremendous

00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:41,280
opportunity with Drupal 8 to go in and

00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:44,610
really start changing things and making

00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:46,140
things interesting and accessible to

00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:50,010
ordinary people i'm not talking about

00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:52,020
people who are our sight impaired or

00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:55,140
anything like that but accessible to

00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:57,480
just average people like that guy who

00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:59,580
was one of your personas this morning

00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:01,590
who said you know i just i had to give

00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:04,380
up I couldn't do it that's a shame and

00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:05,730
this is why things like WordPress are

00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:07,350
doing so well because they go in and

00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:09,690
they say hey you know it's dead easy and

00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:11,909
you hear you buy a theme for 28 bucks

00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:16,350
and you know how much functionality do

00:26:11,909 --> 00:26:18,059
you actually need another little

00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:20,370
disappointment from this morning was

00:26:18,059 --> 00:26:24,330
that all of the websites shown all

00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:26,280
around the world looked like cookie

00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:28,559
cutting and Qatar models of each other

00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:30,840
and you can buy this on dotster for

00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:33,390
60 bucks a pop with code and picture

00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:35,340
rights there are a row of tabs at the

00:26:33,390 --> 00:26:36,650
top a big useless picture and three

00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:40,289
things you can click on underneath

00:26:36,650 --> 00:26:42,659
that's the design right now we've got to

00:26:40,289 --> 00:26:46,110
move beyond that user experience is not

00:26:42,659 --> 00:26:48,419
a big useless picture but that's what

00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:51,419
we're designing and with the exception

00:26:48,419 --> 00:26:55,230
of the penguins in Antarctica every one

00:26:51,419 --> 00:26:56,760
of the sites looked like that ah there

00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:59,640
was one that actually had a form out on

00:26:56,760 --> 00:27:03,510
the right but but for the most part it's

00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:04,289
just same same same same and I know some

00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:06,750
of these sites and they're not

00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:08,630
particularly function rich you could

00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:10,770
probably have done it in WordPress

00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:14,190
you've got to move beyond that you've

00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:16,899
got to show the world why yours is a

00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:18,950
much more interesting product

00:27:16,899 --> 00:27:23,870
if we look at the future of our industry

00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:26,059
I think it's important to think you know

00:27:23,870 --> 00:27:28,220
are we a CMS or we digital platform I

00:27:26,059 --> 00:27:31,429
think that we are a digital platform we

00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:33,620
are not just a publishing tool to the

00:27:31,429 --> 00:27:35,659
internet but we need to publish to

00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:37,100
multiple channels and in different ways

00:27:35,659 --> 00:27:39,230
and this isn't just a question of being

00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:42,559
responsive or adaptive this is a

00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:44,840
question of actually doing something

00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:46,639
that is responsive to the needs of the

00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:52,789
user and not just the needs of the

00:27:46,639 --> 00:27:55,549
device I if I need to figure out how the

00:27:52,789 --> 00:27:58,100
Prague metro system works I can go on

00:27:55,549 --> 00:28:02,450
the internet and I can find their map

00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:04,159
and I can chart out a route but if I'm

00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:05,659
standing in the middle of prague i want

00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:07,519
to point my smartphone and I want it to

00:28:05,659 --> 00:28:10,429
tell me that the nearest station is

00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:12,950
there and it's 200 meters away that's a

00:28:10,429 --> 00:28:15,590
very different kind of experience and

00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:17,330
this is what we need to be doing we are

00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:19,250
not thinking enough about it it's not

00:28:17,330 --> 00:28:20,630
just mobile first mobile first by the

00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:22,700
way is a very dangerous term because

00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:25,220
cheapskate clients in a down economy

00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:27,620
have a tendency to say well it's mobile

00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:29,330
only and so they'll do something that'll

00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:31,340
work on us not smartphone but doesn't

00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:36,799
actually work on a laptop or a large

00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:38,870
screen I mentioned before about making

00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:40,460
assumptions let me tell you a story let

00:28:38,870 --> 00:28:43,630
me see how my time is doing oh we're in

00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:45,980
good shape I want to tell you a story

00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:50,059
how many are there any Americans in the

00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:52,779
audience okay one two three four huh no

00:28:50,059 --> 00:28:52,779
you're not sure

00:28:52,950 --> 00:29:01,070
okay no I'm just asking I'm just all

00:28:56,100 --> 00:29:06,179
right I'm going to tell you a story now

00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:14,279
listen closely it's a cold January day

00:29:06,179 --> 00:29:16,289
and the charismatic 43 year old chief

00:29:14,279 --> 00:29:21,480
executive is of his country has just

00:29:16,289 --> 00:29:27,570
been sworn in okay his predecessor is

00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:31,139
standing next to him a general who 15

00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:32,760
years earlier had led his country's army

00:29:31,139 --> 00:29:37,070
in a war that ultimately led to the

00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:40,429
defeat of Germany after the swearing in

00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:42,960
the young chief executive 43 years old

00:29:40,429 --> 00:29:44,460
stood and watched parades in his honor

00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:49,830
for five hours and then partied until

00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:52,019
three in the morning we all on the same

00:29:49,830 --> 00:30:02,149
page here do you know who I'm talking

00:29:52,019 --> 00:30:05,429
about who am I talking about excuse me

00:30:02,149 --> 00:30:12,090
the Eisenhower wasn't 43 but he was a

00:30:05,429 --> 00:30:18,570
general what Kennedy how many of you

00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:22,649
thought it was Kennedy okay it isn't

00:30:18,570 --> 00:30:25,769
it's actually add off Hitler there are a

00:30:22,649 --> 00:30:27,990
lot of similarities between they were

00:30:25,769 --> 00:30:31,409
both 43 years old Kennedy and Hitler

00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:33,059
they both were preceded by generals I

00:30:31,409 --> 00:30:34,679
sucker-punched you to some extent by

00:30:33,059 --> 00:30:36,899
asking how many Americans who were just

00:30:34,679 --> 00:30:38,929
to try and prime the pump and get you to

00:30:36,899 --> 00:30:41,700
think in terms of something other than

00:30:38,929 --> 00:30:45,120
it was very careful in introducing my

00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:48,600
general I said no no no he was general

00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:50,970
that led his country's army in a war

00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:52,980
that ultimately led to the defeat of

00:30:50,970 --> 00:30:57,600
Germany I didn't say that he was on the

00:30:52,980 --> 00:31:01,909
winning side this is a problem when we

00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:01,909
go out and we do our research yes sir

00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:15,570
oh that's all right we are huh that's

00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:17,250
that's okay that's good you're going to

00:31:15,570 --> 00:31:19,470
hear about big data throughout this

00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:21,390
conference because that's what people

00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:22,890
are into now I mean when the Harvard

00:31:21,390 --> 00:31:24,930
Business Review put something on the

00:31:22,890 --> 00:31:27,090
cover you know that everybody's going to

00:31:24,930 --> 00:31:29,400
talk about it for a long time you also

00:31:27,090 --> 00:31:31,140
know that well the subjects been around

00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:32,640
for about two years before harvard

00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:35,610
business review starts to write about it

00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:37,560
that's a different matter entirely but

00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:39,390
big data if we take a look at there's a

00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:44,460
there's an international chain of stores

00:31:39,390 --> 00:31:46,830
called walmart and I mean they have a

00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:49,280
turnover that's larger than the gross

00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:53,310
national product of many many countries

00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:55,860
they they collect enough data I can't

00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:58,620
remember how many petabytes they do but

00:31:55,860 --> 00:32:01,190
every hour if they printed this data out

00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:06,780
it would fill 20,000 filing cabinets

00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:08,160
every hour that's big data it's not a

00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:09,960
question of collecting the data but it's

00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:12,360
a question of trying to see the patterns

00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:15,570
and what happens is here I I gave you a

00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:18,930
lot of data and said can can you spot a

00:32:15,570 --> 00:32:21,090
historic something in it but in fact

00:32:18,930 --> 00:32:23,970
there's a pattern that repeated from

00:32:21,090 --> 00:32:25,080
january nineteen thirty three you've got

00:32:23,970 --> 00:32:26,580
to be very careful when you start

00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:27,840
analyzing the data to make sure that

00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:30,440
you're asking all the right questions

00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:32,610
that you've done something that actually

00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:35,670
really differentiates what you're

00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:38,250
working on from what your assumptions

00:32:35,670 --> 00:32:40,620
may lead you to in this case the

00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:44,160
question that was missing was what date

00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:46,170
was this again this is all going back to

00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:47,910
the why because if we don't understand

00:32:46,170 --> 00:32:53,280
why we're doing things we're going to

00:32:47,910 --> 00:32:55,380
end up building the wrong thing a little

00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:58,020
more about the future i have an acronym

00:32:55,380 --> 00:33:00,510
i call ESP like extrasensory perception

00:32:58,020 --> 00:33:02,670
i think this is where a lot of things

00:33:00,510 --> 00:33:04,290
are going to be going in the future and

00:33:02,670 --> 00:33:06,930
the first is that we are going to be

00:33:04,290 --> 00:33:08,400
able to extract patterns our phones are

00:33:06,930 --> 00:33:10,320
going to be able to extract patterns

00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:12,960
from what we're doing certainly google

00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:15,300
is already doing this walmart with all

00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,830
their data discovered that in Florida

00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:19,039
when there's

00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:21,440
hurricane they sell out of a small

00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:24,320
pastry that you put in the toaster

00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:27,470
called a pop tart strawberry pop-tarts

00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:29,330
and so they went in and they analyzed

00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:31,850
the data and they said okay when there's

00:33:29,330 --> 00:33:36,260
a hurricane everybody buys these crappy

00:33:31,850 --> 00:33:37,610
little pastries and strawberry why not

00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:41,510
blueberry or any one of the other

00:33:37,610 --> 00:33:42,590
flavors that was the pattern and using

00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:44,000
the pattern then they went out and they

00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:45,260
started to interview people well in

00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,399
Florida when you have hurricane the

00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:51,049
power goes out so you end up eating cold

00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:53,269
spaghetti out of a can or something else

00:33:51,049 --> 00:33:55,250
you have no electricity no air

00:33:53,269 --> 00:33:57,529
conditioning you have no phone service

00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:58,880
so you have a lot of canned goods and

00:33:57,529 --> 00:34:02,539
that's what you need to eat for the week

00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:04,820
or two until services restored it turns

00:34:02,539 --> 00:34:07,639
out that strawberry pop-tarts one of the

00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:11,000
few flavors that you can eat without

00:34:07,639 --> 00:34:12,940
gagging because it's so dry when the

00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:17,030
power is out when you can't heat it up

00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:20,149
who knew Walmart knows hurricane on its

00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:23,659
way to the south stock up on strawberry

00:34:20,149 --> 00:34:25,550
pop-tarts so we've got to start looking

00:34:23,659 --> 00:34:26,990
at you know what kinds of things can we

00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:29,599
spot it's not just the question of

00:34:26,990 --> 00:34:31,220
patches and and this but to figure out

00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:34,429
the why where are we going what are we

00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:37,609
doing so extract patterns that's what

00:34:34,429 --> 00:34:40,460
our tools our platform needs to be able

00:34:37,609 --> 00:34:42,770
to do and then it also has to become

00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:45,230
situationally aware i'm thinking of

00:34:42,770 --> 00:34:48,440
course location that's pretty easy all

00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:50,389
the phones have GPS but also a motion

00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:54,139
based we have magnetometers and we have

00:34:50,389 --> 00:34:55,940
accelerometers already in our phones you

00:34:54,139 --> 00:34:58,790
know does it know whether I'm standing

00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:59,900
still or whether I'm moving these are

00:34:58,790 --> 00:35:01,490
the kinds of tools that are going to

00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:03,349
have to be built into Drupal so that

00:35:01,490 --> 00:35:06,410
people can can use this kind of

00:35:03,349 --> 00:35:08,359
information so that if I am in Prague at

00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:10,849
nine in the morning maybe I'm looking

00:35:08,359 --> 00:35:12,380
for a bank and if I'm in Prague at nine

00:35:10,849 --> 00:35:16,369
in the evening maybe I'm looking for a

00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:18,849
bar let it start to make at least some

00:35:16,369 --> 00:35:21,020
basic prediction somebody mentioned a

00:35:18,849 --> 00:35:23,930
personalization this morning i guess it

00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:25,670
was dreese and i think we're going to

00:35:23,930 --> 00:35:27,740
see a lot more personalization because

00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:29,630
there just is so much information

00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:32,150
out there if we are going to use

00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:34,430
augmented reality or Google glass I mean

00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:36,590
there's a lot of stuff that is changing

00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:38,090
our world right now we're going to have

00:35:36,590 --> 00:35:42,740
to start building tools that make all of

00:35:38,090 --> 00:35:45,590
this possible for us so I guess

00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:48,860
basically that's that's my message to

00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:51,080
you I it's not very deep but I think

00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:53,150
ultimately it's going to move you

00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:57,410
forward you've got to think about the

00:35:53,150 --> 00:36:00,070
why now unhappy customers can result in

00:35:57,410 --> 00:36:04,369
really really really bad things and

00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:08,150
happy customers or one over by good

00:36:04,369 --> 00:36:17,140
design so that's really what i have to

00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:21,290
say thank you very very much we have

00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:28,690
about 15 minutes for questions anything

00:36:21,290 --> 00:36:28,690
you all want coffee is what you want yes

00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:09,430
isn't it somewhat unfair it's gonna wrap

00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:19,280
the truth will into this hard to use

00:37:09,430 --> 00:37:21,740
stereotype we're talking about two

00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:24,020
different things I weather website

00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:25,730
usability is good or bad that's up to

00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:27,710
the designers either you know how to do

00:37:25,730 --> 00:37:30,320
internet interaction designer you don't

00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:33,230
and there are various best practices and

00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:34,790
there are design patterns and all kinds

00:37:33,230 --> 00:37:36,380
of other things there are a lot of

00:37:34,790 --> 00:37:38,930
resources and we've got a lot of

00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:43,570
research and case studies now that show

00:37:38,930 --> 00:37:45,830
how good web design is affected however

00:37:43,570 --> 00:37:47,150
when somebody wants to upload new

00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:48,020
content they're not going to call you

00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:51,110
they're going to do that themselves

00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:53,120
they're there that is why that's where

00:37:51,110 --> 00:37:55,100
drupal comes in and if you cannot figure

00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:57,290
out how to upload content or add a

00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:59,060
picture or change your metadata then

00:37:57,290 --> 00:38:01,520
there's a problem and this is exactly

00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:03,710
the problem that many users of drupal

00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:05,540
face it came from a very very geeky

00:38:03,710 --> 00:38:09,410
background and you've made quantum leaps

00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:12,320
but you're not there yet if you look at

00:38:09,410 --> 00:38:15,230
typo3 typo3 just sort of petered out and

00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:17,450
it's completely geeky and even two

00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:19,160
different implementations of the same

00:38:17,450 --> 00:38:20,960
site on type of three will look

00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:22,850
different in the back end so there are

00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:25,190
some people who got rich you know

00:38:22,850 --> 00:38:27,980
reskinning this so that they could hide

00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:31,420
all the geekiness that's not the way to

00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:31,420
design that's just a patch

00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:51,859
well I beg to differ I I hear from

00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:53,060
people that know we can't his drupal to

00:38:51,859 --> 00:38:58,310
do that now maybe that their

00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:59,990
implementation of Drupal is crap it yes

00:38:58,310 --> 00:39:01,310
it is because if people have the

00:38:59,990 --> 00:39:03,109
perception that this is a difficult

00:39:01,310 --> 00:39:05,450
product to use then they're not going to

00:39:03,109 --> 00:39:07,520
use it our job now is to make sure that

00:39:05,450 --> 00:39:10,160
people understand that the perception is

00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:11,720
wrong I Drive a Jaguar everybody laughs

00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:13,670
oh you have to have two Jaguars you have

00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:15,560
two one in the shop and and one on the

00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:17,830
road this was because they built really

00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:21,200
shitty cars in the middle of the 70s

00:39:17,830 --> 00:39:22,730
yeah ever say the last 10 15 years

00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:24,380
they've made very good cars but there's

00:39:22,730 --> 00:39:27,410
still a stigma attached to that

00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:32,330
particular mark and and Drupal has a

00:39:27,410 --> 00:39:34,160
stigma of being a very very technically

00:39:32,330 --> 00:39:36,940
sophisticated product that's difficult

00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:38,960
for ordinary people to to approach and

00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:40,850
yes you can do a very good

00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:42,170
implementation but there are a lot of

00:39:40,850 --> 00:39:44,480
people who aren't doing good in blue

00:39:42,170 --> 00:39:48,380
implementations and hopefully with with

00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:49,700
eight then a lot of the crap that I see

00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:51,380
out there is not going to be happening

00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:53,330
and it's not a question of the end user

00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:55,190
design it's a question of the back end

00:39:53,330 --> 00:39:58,340
for the publishers for the content

00:39:55,190 --> 00:40:01,970
providers for the publishing rights I

00:39:58,340 --> 00:40:04,670
mean we we did not choose Drupal for our

00:40:01,970 --> 00:40:06,470
site not because I'm married to psych or

00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:11,380
in any way but your language layers

00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:14,240
sucked our site is in nine languages and

00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:15,830
we couldn't administrate it properly in

00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:17,780
Drupal we couldn't do the things we

00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:19,460
wanted to do now that is one of the

00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:21,080
issues that's being addressed in eight

00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:23,150
and I think that's going to make a major

00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:24,680
change for you also there are a lot of

00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:26,930
good things on the way there are a lot

00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:29,630
of good things in the current current

00:40:26,930 --> 00:40:32,180
version Lisa rifles and all the people

00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:34,850
who worked so hard on making Drupal 7 a

00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:37,550
reality really worked hard I mean it's

00:40:34,850 --> 00:40:40,010
quantum leap from six to seven but

00:40:37,550 --> 00:40:41,869
there's a perception and it doesn't mean

00:40:40,010 --> 00:40:43,580
the perception and reality are the same

00:40:41,869 --> 00:40:46,180
thing but it's something that we need to

00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:46,180
fight against

00:40:47,130 --> 00:41:06,460
okay you could question a way to say

00:41:02,650 --> 00:41:08,650
yeah this is easy but then you have the

00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:12,819
problem that when you want to extend it

00:41:08,650 --> 00:41:14,829
then it's getting worried so yeah it's

00:41:12,819 --> 00:41:18,729
really what you buy into it and I think

00:41:14,829 --> 00:41:21,460
the next ability Google is very nice but

00:41:18,729 --> 00:41:25,739
yes I can see that for a normal user

00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:25,739
very long you have been the phone saying

00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:32,259
but has changed as well so it might be

00:41:29,410 --> 00:41:34,509
that in the 15th they gather I made

00:41:32,259 --> 00:41:38,170
luxion task but those might be the group

00:41:34,509 --> 00:41:40,569
of making love SMS in the version 6 but

00:41:38,170 --> 00:41:49,660
I think that seven is actually a lot

00:41:40,569 --> 00:41:52,809
better 6 you know I agree with you

00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:55,180
entirely I think that psycho is geeky I

00:41:52,809 --> 00:41:58,529
think episerver is de I think ektron is

00:41:55,180 --> 00:42:02,650
geeky my goodness some of the best-known

00:41:58,529 --> 00:42:04,989
CMS is the really hardcore ones say 15

00:42:02,650 --> 00:42:06,999
years ago were vignettes story server

00:42:04,989 --> 00:42:09,369
and interwoven I mean you didn't even

00:42:06,999 --> 00:42:10,779
get code you got a stack of books that

00:42:09,369 --> 00:42:13,239
told you how to put together a website

00:42:10,779 --> 00:42:15,940
it was a crazy and I was violently

00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:17,619
expensive and you could have 20

00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:21,519
developers sitting in a meeting room for

00:42:17,619 --> 00:42:25,329
half a year coding this site it was it

00:42:21,519 --> 00:42:27,249
was crazy and today things are much much

00:42:25,329 --> 00:42:30,130
easier well I think this is also an

00:42:27,249 --> 00:42:34,719
opportunity for Drupal that that because

00:42:30,130 --> 00:42:37,779
everything is still a little not so

00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:40,210
understandable to old-time journalists

00:42:37,779 --> 00:42:41,979
and others who are assuming content

00:42:40,210 --> 00:42:43,569
provider roles I think you have an

00:42:41,979 --> 00:42:45,999
opportunity really to do something and

00:42:43,569 --> 00:42:49,769
to change that perception but there's

00:42:45,999 --> 00:42:49,769
hard work in front of you yes sir

00:43:59,530 --> 00:44:06,560
so last night I spent about 10 minutes

00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:08,890
trying to find out where my own session

00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:11,060
was and when I was going to start yeah

00:44:08,890 --> 00:44:16,250
the information architecture was

00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:18,340
appalling I so friends you know all of

00:44:16,250 --> 00:44:23,060
these kinds of things send out signals

00:44:18,340 --> 00:44:25,660
the click the take the survey link I

00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:31,370
mean it's this is a power point where

00:44:25,660 --> 00:44:32,690
how do you click on that link I these

00:44:31,370 --> 00:44:34,550
things need to be thought through and

00:44:32,690 --> 00:44:36,890
and I don't think that they always

00:44:34,550 --> 00:44:39,140
always are and and you do have a

00:44:36,890 --> 00:44:41,540
remarkable opportunity now and I beg you

00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:45,310
all to go out there and to and to really

00:44:41,540 --> 00:44:45,310
change the world you can do it

00:44:58,630 --> 00:45:07,390
because maurices us we had to build a

00:45:02,990 --> 00:45:07,390
new come too tired and so

00:46:24,030 --> 00:46:27,270
right without that was best practices

00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:32,520
it's interesting you mentioned the

00:46:27,270 --> 00:46:34,800
mentioned cars because up until a 1916

00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:37,830
that is to say 20 years after the first

00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:39,810
commercial automobile in 1896 that was

00:46:37,830 --> 00:46:42,600
the first time the standard H pattern

00:46:39,810 --> 00:46:46,430
was introduced as a shift in the

00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:49,220
nineteen sixteen Cadillac and x 1920

00:46:46,430 --> 00:46:52,680
there was a lot of standardization for

00:46:49,220 --> 00:46:55,080
the simple reason that people were now

00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:56,310
in the car rental business and you had

00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:57,840
you didn't have time to teach people to

00:46:56,310 --> 00:47:01,250
drive every time you've rented out a new

00:46:57,840 --> 00:47:03,720
car took Henry Ford a long time to

00:47:01,250 --> 00:47:06,960
you've ever driven a Model T this is a

00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:08,850
completely screwball car and has

00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:10,770
absolutely no relation to the way we

00:47:08,850 --> 00:47:13,110
have we would think of cars being driven

00:47:10,770 --> 00:47:15,120
today you shift gears by holding down a

00:47:13,110 --> 00:47:17,490
pedal and then releasing a pedal and the

00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:19,470
gas is actually a lever on the steering

00:47:17,490 --> 00:47:23,640
column it's it's not an easy car to

00:47:19,470 --> 00:47:24,870
drive but standardization is coming and

00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:27,000
we're seeing that in the way that

00:47:24,870 --> 00:47:29,340
WYSIWYG editors for example look the

00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:31,380
order of the icons is first it's bold

00:47:29,340 --> 00:47:33,630
then it's italic then its underlying we

00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:36,630
have a lot of standards that that we're

00:47:33,630 --> 00:47:38,640
working on and that's good so retro

00:47:36,630 --> 00:47:40,350
ductive inference we can use things we

00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:42,390
learn one place and use them someplace

00:47:40,350 --> 00:47:44,040
else but you're also right about user

00:47:42,390 --> 00:47:46,920
experience being part of it because if

00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:48,300
the WYSIWYG editor works fine but then

00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:51,930
you can't figure out how to save your

00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:56,120
work or something else goes wrong user

00:47:51,930 --> 00:47:59,460
experience ultimately is the sum total

00:47:56,120 --> 00:48:01,620
up in your head following a series of

00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:03,720
interactions between people processes

00:48:01,620 --> 00:48:06,090
and machines can be between two people

00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:07,650
can be between two machines if two

00:48:06,090 --> 00:48:09,120
servers are fighting it out in the

00:48:07,650 --> 00:48:12,660
background and I'm waiting for a

00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:14,700
download my experience is bad so it's

00:48:12,660 --> 00:48:17,130
also up to us when we look at our

00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:19,920
modules to choreograph this experience

00:48:17,130 --> 00:48:24,150
across multiple touchpoints also within

00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:25,740
the program yeah it's just that thing

00:48:24,150 --> 00:48:29,070
when having a discussion like this it's

00:48:25,740 --> 00:48:31,500
easy to get defensible or defensive but

00:48:29,070 --> 00:48:34,380
I mean the fact that typo3 sucks worse

00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:36,650
and we might be on par with sitecore it

00:48:34,380 --> 00:48:43,730
doesn't liberate us for from our

00:48:36,650 --> 00:48:46,569
both the need and the welder need to

00:48:43,730 --> 00:48:48,859
move on and improve I mean it's also our

00:48:46,569 --> 00:48:50,240
opportunity because everybody if

00:48:48,859 --> 00:48:53,119
everybody else is standing still and we

00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:54,680
continually try to like take a critical

00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:57,619
look at ourself and improve our user

00:48:54,680 --> 00:49:00,470
experience we will get ahead so I mean

00:48:57,619 --> 00:49:02,750
yeah sitecore might be just as bad and

00:49:00,470 --> 00:49:04,099
everybody knows type of three sucks but

00:49:02,750 --> 00:49:06,230
we should still keep improving the user

00:49:04,099 --> 00:49:11,210
experience and keep asking ourselves why

00:49:06,230 --> 00:49:12,650
I hope I didn't insult insult you in any

00:49:11,210 --> 00:49:14,180
way because I don't I don't I don't I

00:49:12,650 --> 00:49:16,039
don't mean to but I can come here and I

00:49:14,180 --> 00:49:17,539
can jabber it for an hour about all the

00:49:16,039 --> 00:49:18,740
wonderful things about Drupal but you

00:49:17,539 --> 00:49:20,630
already know that that's why you're part

00:49:18,740 --> 00:49:22,400
of the community I come in as somebody

00:49:20,630 --> 00:49:24,079
who deals with clients and marketing

00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:25,190
directors and others and these are the

00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:39,619
things that I here in these are the

00:49:25,190 --> 00:49:43,990
things that I've experienced thank you

00:49:39,619 --> 00:49:43,990
there was a hand here yes sir

00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:57,170
well you said some very interesting and

00:50:55,130 --> 00:50:59,450
this is not anything that I've ever

00:50:57,170 --> 00:51:02,630
heard before I understand what you mean

00:50:59,450 --> 00:51:05,840
but I have never heard this expressed by

00:51:02,630 --> 00:51:11,600
anyone that Drupal is a tool to build

00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:14,540
the CMS I think it's true but this isn't

00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:16,010
the public perception all right well so

00:51:14,540 --> 00:51:17,960
if people think that they're going to

00:51:16,010 --> 00:51:20,060
get to CMS and they going to be that

00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:23,000
interaction with the product is going to

00:51:20,060 --> 00:51:24,710
start out in a very negative way and so

00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:27,470
these are the things that I think that

00:51:24,710 --> 00:51:29,270
we need to get get beyond perhaps they

00:51:27,470 --> 00:51:32,000
need to be sort of standard Drupal

00:51:29,270 --> 00:51:34,700
packages and so here is the CMS here is

00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:37,970
the e-commerce tool here is here's the

00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:41,180
customer experience management kit to go

00:51:37,970 --> 00:51:44,210
on top of your CMS here is the stuff

00:51:41,180 --> 00:51:47,450
that we can add on to to introduce

00:51:44,210 --> 00:51:49,490
social media into the publishing flow of

00:51:47,450 --> 00:51:51,470
what we're doing so there are lots of

00:51:49,490 --> 00:51:53,480
opportunities and I mean none of this in

00:51:51,470 --> 00:51:55,610
a bad way towards the the Drupal

00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:57,050
community I assisted it's a waste of

00:51:55,610 --> 00:52:02,390
time if I just come up here like a

00:51:57,050 --> 00:52:03,920
cheerleader in rah rah rah I come from

00:52:02,390 --> 00:52:05,359
yeah I talked to people who don't

00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:45,980
necessarily like the product and I'm

00:52:05,359 --> 00:52:49,069
trying to share this with you sir the

00:52:45,980 --> 00:52:51,289
point this is a really good discussion

00:52:49,069 --> 00:52:53,059
and actually there's an issue for to go

00:52:51,289 --> 00:52:54,769
to make a landing page that shows off

00:52:53,059 --> 00:52:56,779
the different Drupal distributions I

00:52:54,769 --> 00:52:58,250
think what Jenny saying the full was

00:52:56,779 --> 00:52:59,839
right that ultimately is up to the site

00:52:58,250 --> 00:53:01,099
builders to create a good user

00:52:59,839 --> 00:53:02,569
experience for their clients because

00:53:01,099 --> 00:53:03,740
they know the low you know the use cases

00:53:02,569 --> 00:53:06,410
and little niches and stuff like that

00:53:03,740 --> 00:53:08,720
but I do a lot of work on Drupal core

00:53:06,410 --> 00:53:11,150
usability I think the benefit there is

00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:13,839
providing really good tools to allow the

00:53:11,150 --> 00:53:15,980
side builders and the distribution

00:53:13,839 --> 00:53:18,589
developers to actually make that in

00:53:15,980 --> 00:53:20,809
don't really get tool so yeah it's not a

00:53:18,589 --> 00:53:23,559
question sorry but that's a lot of what

00:53:20,809 --> 00:53:23,559
we're doing into play

00:53:25,250 --> 00:53:34,820
I learned just to notice first about

00:53:28,180 --> 00:53:37,040
type of three okay that sucks but in

00:53:34,820 --> 00:53:41,630
Switzerland all the administration is

00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:45,920
using or all the council is 26 of the

00:53:41,630 --> 00:53:47,290
city's everyone so I expected everybody

00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:50,230
using it

00:53:47,290 --> 00:53:53,230
and so does lufthansa and and and

00:53:50,230 --> 00:54:19,710
Volkswagen I mean it's it's the largest

00:53:53,230 --> 00:54:23,800
CMS system in Germany the ones okay this

00:54:19,710 --> 00:54:25,840
this I think it takes two weeks I want

00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:28,630
to have it in today's I mean the result

00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:31,480
and I can achieve this work I don't say

00:54:28,630 --> 00:54:34,990
i'm using drupal I'm say we will do

00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:38,110
something the package two days later we

00:54:34,990 --> 00:54:40,570
get all the information and young that's

00:54:38,110 --> 00:54:43,690
all I don't advertise it so for me I

00:54:40,570 --> 00:54:47,140
dancing yes maybe to your customs to

00:54:43,690 --> 00:54:50,880
mark as me as possible I won't tell that

00:54:47,140 --> 00:54:56,130
my directors my buttons that is stupid

00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:56,130
or maybe they will ask me afterwards yes

00:54:57,470 --> 00:55:02,910
it was a good point I people ask me so

00:55:01,470 --> 00:55:05,880
well so what would you recommend in

00:55:02,910 --> 00:55:07,290
terms of a CMS and and their Drupal is

00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:08,850
on the list and so if you want open

00:55:07,290 --> 00:55:11,070
source this is the one that I would

00:55:08,850 --> 00:55:53,010
choose I wouldn't go with um lurve some

00:55:11,070 --> 00:55:54,930
of the other things out there but as

00:55:53,010 --> 00:55:58,860
long as you can keep the technical parts

00:55:54,930 --> 00:56:02,250
away from the people like me who no

00:55:58,860 --> 00:56:05,160
longer code and and just want to be able

00:56:02,250 --> 00:56:07,410
to go and use it pretty much as you know

00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:11,520
some an easy way to get content online

00:56:07,410 --> 00:56:17,250
or two to correct a layout or whatever I

00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:20,150
mean there there's a somewhere there's

00:56:17,250 --> 00:56:24,420
that there's a continuum of what we know

00:56:20,150 --> 00:56:30,030
we know nothing we know a lot we know we

00:56:24,420 --> 00:56:32,100
know something and on this line this is

00:56:30,030 --> 00:56:35,940
what we know this is what we need to

00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:39,210
know in order to use the product and our

00:56:35,940 --> 00:56:41,820
job in terms of creating intuitive

00:56:39,210 --> 00:56:44,210
interfaces is to make sure these things

00:56:41,820 --> 00:56:47,160
are as close as possible to each other

00:56:44,210 --> 00:56:49,230
it's really not more complicated that

00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:51,000
applies to everything that we do people

00:56:49,230 --> 00:56:52,440
go to one website and they expect to be

00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:55,050
able to use the skills that they've

00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:57,840
learned one place and apply them

00:56:55,050 --> 00:57:00,570
someplace else how many of you had been

00:56:57,840 --> 00:57:05,040
to the Prague Airport before a couple of

00:57:00,570 --> 00:57:06,660
days ago not not so many of you so this

00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:09,300
is your first time at the Prague Airport

00:57:06,660 --> 00:57:11,180
Wow cool did you have trouble finding

00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:15,270
your bag

00:57:11,180 --> 00:57:17,339
no because airports are incredibly

00:57:15,270 --> 00:57:22,740
standardized as opposed to train

00:57:17,339 --> 00:57:25,470
stations across Europe I'll tell you

00:57:22,740 --> 00:57:27,839
what let's just stay safe the problem

00:57:25,470 --> 00:57:29,579
the point is that there are wayfinding

00:57:27,839 --> 00:57:31,799
conventions that are being used at

00:57:29,579 --> 00:57:34,410
airports and although Prague may have

00:57:31,799 --> 00:57:37,020
certain problems all airports of certain

00:57:34,410 --> 00:57:39,299
problems my point though is that baggage

00:57:37,020 --> 00:57:41,520
is called baggage claim everywhere in

00:57:39,299 --> 00:57:45,240
the world you can't even agree on what

00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:48,869
tracks are called and across Europe at

00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:52,799
train stations now if some consultant

00:57:48,869 --> 00:57:56,010
comes in and says we're going to be very

00:57:52,799 --> 00:57:58,740
innovative and if I go up and I hand

00:57:56,010 --> 00:58:00,510
somebody my passport and the woman

00:57:58,740 --> 00:58:05,670
behind the counter says yes and and

00:58:00,510 --> 00:58:08,730
you'll find your plane at port q so what

00:58:05,670 --> 00:58:10,829
port Q is it well we had an innovation

00:58:08,730 --> 00:58:12,539
consultant then and you know you may

00:58:10,829 --> 00:58:15,660
know it as a gate but we call it ports

00:58:12,539 --> 00:58:17,760
and Q is the 17th letter of the Latin

00:58:15,660 --> 00:58:19,380
alphabet so you may know it is gate 17

00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:22,440
but we call it port cute have a nice

00:58:19,380 --> 00:58:26,069
flight this would drive us crazy this is

00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:28,589
what happens in a lot of typo3 couldn't

00:58:26,069 --> 00:58:30,599
even label metadata correctly I mean

00:58:28,589 --> 00:58:32,549
there are three categories of HTML

00:58:30,599 --> 00:58:35,130
metadata there's a meta title keywords

00:58:32,549 --> 00:58:39,990
description they invented their own

00:58:35,130 --> 00:58:42,480
terms people who actually knew how to

00:58:39,990 --> 00:58:46,099
code couldn't go into typo3 and figure

00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:46,099
out how to use it this is crazy

01:00:07,610 --> 01:00:12,230
these have been around for 20 years Tony

01:00:10,650 --> 01:00:15,000
burn has been doing this all his life

01:00:12,230 --> 01:00:17,280
the reports are very expensive they cost

01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:20,940
several thousand dollars but I all of

01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:23,760
these things are benchmarked if you if

01:00:20,940 --> 01:00:26,250
you google Tony Tony burn byr and he

01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:28,200
you'll find a lot of information but he

01:00:26,250 --> 01:00:31,500
has a site called CMS something or other

01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:33,360
I can't remember the title of it but

01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:38,460
there is there's a lot of benchmarking

01:00:33,360 --> 01:00:40,260
material out there okay right okay lunch

01:00:38,460 --> 01:00:46,830

01:00:40,260 --> 01:00:48,180
