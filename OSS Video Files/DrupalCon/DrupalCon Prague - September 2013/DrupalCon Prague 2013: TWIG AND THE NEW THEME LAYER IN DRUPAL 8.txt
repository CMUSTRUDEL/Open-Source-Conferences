Title: DrupalCon Prague 2013: TWIG AND THE NEW THEME LAYER IN DRUPAL 8
Publication date: 2013-09-26
Playlist: DrupalCon Prague - September 2013
Description: 
	Drupal 8 will have a fancy new template engine (Twig) and a simplified theme layer (we hope). We'll show you the new template syntax (don't worry, it's easy) and walk through some of the major problems in Drupal 7 that have either already been solved in Drupal 8, or that we are still working hard on improving.

Things we're currently improving include:

Syntax
Consistency
Complexity
Redundancy
Security
Learn about all the changes in the Drupal 8 theme layer, and find out how you can get involved. We want Drupal 8 to be easy for theme developers and people new to Drupal, and also make more sense to the pros.

We still need your help, come learn what we're working on and how to get involved!
