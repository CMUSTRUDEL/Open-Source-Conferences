Publication date: 2013-09-26
Playlist: DrupalCon Prague - September 2013
Description: 
	Package- and dependency management is like source control; somehow we manage to survive without it, but it's a pain in the ass. For some reason, web development has been a place of medival darkness without proper tools for handling packages and dependencies. Until now.

This presentation will showcase how you can leverage NPM, Browserify, Yarnify, Bower, Jam, RequireJS and all of their friends to bring your application and your development process to the age of Enlightenment.
