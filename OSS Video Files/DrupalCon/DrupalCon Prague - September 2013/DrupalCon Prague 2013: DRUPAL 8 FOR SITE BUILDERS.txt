Title: DrupalCon Prague 2013: DRUPAL 8 FOR SITE BUILDERS
Publication date: 2013-09-26
Playlist: DrupalCon Prague - September 2013
Description: 
	Dries' dream to eliminate the programmer comes closer with every new major release of Drupal. While we are not there yet, Drupal 8 has become more powerful and flexible out of the box for site builders.

In this talk, we will cover the major new or improved tools and features that are available for site builders in Drupal 8, such as:

Views in core;
New configurable fields e.g. entity reference, date, e-mail and others;
Multilingual changes;
Blocks & Layouts;
Responsive images and breakpoints;
and much, much more...
Creating a site has just become easier for everyone.

of drupalcon after the keynote of course

00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:15,750
a little bit about me my name is

00:00:13,469 --> 00:00:17,760
Christophe if you want to pronounce that

00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:19,859
in Dutch its gist of the yeah but i'm

00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,720
fine with Christophe I'm also fine with

00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:25,109
went 0 which is my handle on twitter

00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:27,359
also on drupal.org i'm a drupal android

00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:29,820
developer and things that i do within

00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:32,219
the drupal projects I'm a Drupal core co

00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:34,620
maintainer for Phil API and I'm also

00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:37,649
delete maintainer for display sweet and

00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:40,170
various other modules currently I'm with

00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:43,230
in between jobs I'm trying to make a

00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:45,780
record I have no I'm the ID when the

00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:48,180
record will be released I guess it's the

00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:51,570
same like we say with triple it will be

00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:55,050
released when it is ready so I'm going

00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:56,699
to talk about Greece's dream and of

00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:58,800
course all the big improvements that we

00:00:56,699 --> 00:01:00,690
have done interpolate some little gems

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:04,260
there's little things that really makes

00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:05,820
I building really awesome and also talk

00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:07,740
a little bit how come trip is doing and

00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:11,070
then some time for questions and answers

00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:13,460
at the end so let's start with dresses

00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:17,220
dream so what is greasiest dream

00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:20,180
Teresa's dream is if my pointer is

00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:23,520
working to eliminate the middleman so

00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:25,380
what is the saying there is no reason

00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,659
open source software should be limited

00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:30,090
to technical users when was the last

00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:33,210
time you hired a webmaster to handcraft

00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:36,780
your website and content using X HTML

00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:39,780
and CSS so I highlighted content if I

00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:43,140
think about my own career I mean like 12

00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:45,180
years ago client used to just send me

00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:48,119
some word documents and I just copy

00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:50,520
pasted content into HTML files and then

00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:53,189
I just maintain a lot of HTML files put

00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:55,530
them on a server and that was it at some

00:01:53,189 --> 00:01:57,450
point CMS's came up and clients were

00:01:55,530 --> 00:02:01,290
able to manage their own content which

00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:02,700
is kind of interesting so he also wants

00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:04,110
to get rid of the developer which is

00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:06,540
kind of scary because i'm a developer

00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:10,860
and i want you to actually keep my job

00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:13,380
and the way that he envisions that is he

00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:16,230
wants to change the developers role

00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:19,020
not maybe maybe eliminating is a bit too

00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:20,790
strong but at least try to redefine the

00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:23,280
role and the way that we incomp lished

00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:24,990
that within Drupal is actually the way

00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:28,920
that have we we have been doing for the

00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:32,220
last ten years actually we create

00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:34,230
modules and with those modules everyone

00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:36,600
is actually able to create websites

00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:40,230
without any programming language which

00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:42,360
is what it's all about and this is not

00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:44,520
something reason jeez has been talking

00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:48,260
about this for a very long time this is

00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:51,480
from a interview has been done in 2009

00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:53,550
so after developer he also wants to get

00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:55,590
rid of the designer which is kind of

00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:57,330
weird I think we have something in court

00:02:55,590 --> 00:03:04,110
that might get rid of the designer which

00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:06,720
is it doesn't work sorry about that ok

00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:08,700
the core module I'm not sure whether

00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:13,050
that will replace the designer I'm

00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:15,330
pretty sure it won't so after we

00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:16,920
eliminate everyone who is left robert

00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:19,080
douglas had a really interesting answer

00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:20,730
on that eliminate the webmaster

00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:22,860
programmers and designer who is left

00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:24,780
decor maintained errs it has actually

00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:27,210
Teresa's plan he wants to get everyone

00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:29,670
involved working on the project so that

00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:31,380
we actually keep our job in some ways

00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:33,900
and that's actually what we have been

00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:35,820
doing with every release of Drupal we

00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:39,090
add more power there is new technology

00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:41,100
we use that new technology we move a lot

00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:42,750
of country modules decor because we see

00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:45,270
that they are popular or they fill

00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:48,870
fulfill some kind of need like say for

00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:51,380
instance views contrib developers become

00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:53,850
core developers and eventually some

00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:57,150
become core maintains which is kind of

00:03:53,850 --> 00:04:00,120
cool so just to make sure if you're a

00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:02,400
developer don't worry we have done a lot

00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:04,560
so let's do a little quiz how many lines

00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:09,750
of code do we have in Drupal one point

00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:13,080
oh I would say shout something three

00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:15,990
thousand I hit 3,000 higher lower five

00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:19,230
thousand so actually not that far away

00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:22,500
it's 4092 so that's Drupal 1 point 0

00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:24,660
which is not a lot if you would open up

00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:26,520
I think would trap that thing file in

00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:29,520
Drupal 8 right now that's more than

00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:31,889
four thousand lines so fast forward to

00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:34,310
Drupal 8 how many lines of code do we

00:04:31,889 --> 00:04:39,810
have in Drupal 8 at this very moment

00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:46,080
shout something I'm at 400 more a little

00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:51,030
bit more or ah it's five hundred

00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:53,009
thousand lines of code which is pretty

00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:55,800
much I use some kind of tool to identify

00:04:53,009 --> 00:04:57,060
all the languages that we use I don't

00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,680
think the tool is actually completely

00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:01,080
right because it's also finding some

00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:03,270
Pascal in Drupal I'm pretty sure we

00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:06,930
don't use both cows so but even even

00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:08,849
though there's a lot of code this also

00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:10,470
includes all the libraries that we have

00:05:08,849 --> 00:05:13,110
been pulling in in Drupal 8 right now

00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:16,800
things like symphony guzzle phpunit

00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:18,419
things like that but that's it we use a

00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,569
lot of code and the developer will not

00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:23,460
die like designers one by either but we

00:05:21,569 --> 00:05:26,370
need a lot of more people to get

00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:28,710
involved so let's talk about the big

00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:31,889
improvements in duple eight so the

00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:34,050
biggest one obviously is views and

00:05:31,889 --> 00:05:38,190
there's an interesting thing about views

00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:40,169
this is a graph and the blue line is a

00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:42,870
Drupal 6 report and installations the

00:05:40,169 --> 00:05:45,210
brown on brown line is the report and

00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:47,130
installations of Drupal 7 so there's

00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:49,759
some dates on there in January two

00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:53,190
thousand eleven we released drupal 7 and

00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:55,380
basically for six months nothing

00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:57,630
happened so we bust our ass for three

00:05:55,380 --> 00:06:00,389
years and nobody is using Drupal 7 which

00:05:57,630 --> 00:06:03,740
is kind of annoying in a way and we see

00:06:00,389 --> 00:06:07,620
that around februari 2012 we finally

00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:11,669
pass the reported installations so it

00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:13,710
takes a year for every release to become

00:06:11,669 --> 00:06:15,870
like more or less popular there are two

00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:18,180
more important dates that are missing at

00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:21,389
this point that is the release candidate

00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:23,430
of views 1.1 in november two thousand

00:06:21,389 --> 00:06:25,830
eleven now you might say this doesn't

00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:29,389
really matter there's another day that

00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:39,930
it's really important and it is jun 17

00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:40,430
2013 is starting to be used why views is

00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:43,190
such a

00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:46,250
your mother it's it's such powerful and

00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:48,230
everyone basically uses it so within the

00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:50,770
drupal 7 cycle views was not ready when

00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:53,510
we released so people didn't really have

00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:56,990
started using drupal 7 so we had to wait

00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:59,210
so in terms of adoption rate moving

00:06:56,990 --> 00:07:01,430
views into core was really interesting

00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:03,740
the state decision because we see that

00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:05,720
everyone uses it so let's put it in

00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:07,610
court so when we release jubilate

00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:11,120
hopefully adoption rate will start

00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:13,280
faster there is a really nice quote from

00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:15,500
Daniel Weiner who says ladies and

00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:17,510
gentlemen you can now use Drupal 7 and

00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:21,580
that is effectively at the release

00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:25,760
better views 1 point 0 release that's

00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:27,500
effectively true and a year later he

00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:30,860
actually said you can now start to use

00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:33,980
Drupal 8 that's a year later after views

00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:35,960
was moved into core I would say one side

00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:38,630
thing do not start using Drupal 8 in

00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:40,670
production it's not ready yet but that's

00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:42,470
the general feeling people are waiting

00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:45,110
for country modules or things to be

00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:47,120
ready to start using Drupal core now

00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:50,840
there's another thing that it's really

00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:53,540
important in terms of Jubal we don't

00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:57,490
maintain backwards compatibility so if

00:07:53,540 --> 00:08:00,650
you would wait to port modules when

00:07:57,490 --> 00:08:02,660
Drupal core is released then especially

00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:04,670
in the case of views they would probably

00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:06,440
be busy for at least another year and a

00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:09,230
half maybe two years maybe that's an

00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:11,300
understatement because views is so huge

00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:13,070
it's so complex and we've been doing so

00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:15,620
much changes in Drupal core that

00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:18,110
basically nobody would you be using it

00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:20,540
and also it's a fantastic battle tester

00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:22,430
we have so much new stuff things like

00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:25,100
configuration management plugins and

00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:27,620
annotations dependency injection routing

00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:30,380
system basically everything that is new

00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:33,140
especially technically in triple 8 views

00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:35,540
is using that and if use works we more

00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:38,030
or less can say okay Drupal 8 is not

00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:40,910
necessarily stable but it does it jobs

00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:43,340
pretty much fine so fantastic battle

00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:45,230
tester every time something goes wrong

00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:47,300
in Drupal 8 we usually fix it somewhere

00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:50,560
within views and then we're done well

00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:53,570
done is a great word but that's it so

00:08:50,560 --> 00:09:00,770
does anyone remember if you use one

00:08:53,570 --> 00:09:02,450
this is during the Drupal 5 area it was

00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:06,110
kind of interesting or a lot of field

00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:08,000
sets it did a job fine actually one of

00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:10,310
my favorite ones was if you had to

00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,580
reorder fields you had to push on those

00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:15,820
little arrows it worked so we didn't put

00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:19,100
that into Drupal 8 core don't worry

00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:20,810
we've moved something much nicer which

00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:23,330
was actually which is basically the

00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:26,180
views tree with some modifications of

00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:28,240
course so few ships with some things in

00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:31,010
core we ship with the default front page

00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:33,590
which means that for instance the node

00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:35,090
callback that doesn't exist anymore so

00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:36,950
if you want a front page you can go to

00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:38,660
views enable it which is also

00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:40,160
interesting because usually when there

00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:42,410
is a new triple release object first

00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:44,570
thing that I usually do is go to the

00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:47,540
website go to / node and see whether

00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:50,300
people have protected it or to see what

00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:51,950
have they to see what happen to see what

00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:54,590
they have done with it or may sometimes

00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:58,580
nothing it depends so front page it's

00:09:54,590 --> 00:10:02,650
now ships with Drupal 8 we now also use

00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:05,390
fuse for content management its default

00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:08,570
view you can add new columns you can

00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:10,700
also add new operations so the basic

00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:12,820
concept of views bulk operations has

00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:15,590
been moved into core really great stuff

00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:17,750
we finally have an overview of all the

00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:21,770
files that are used in core which is

00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:23,900
kind of I mean normal to have that I

00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:28,010
mean you finally have an overview which

00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:30,110
file is used in what place so users in

00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:32,180
court it's really great we can say

00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:34,010
goodbye to a lot of stuff in contrib we

00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:36,290
can say goodbye to views as a content

00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:39,650
module of course views bulk operations

00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:41,240
is partly in core the API is a little

00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:43,640
bit different I actually need to talk to

00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:46,340
bones Ivanovic how much different it is

00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:49,160
but still is there other stuff like

00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:52,010
views watchdog admin views so basically

00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:55,820
the content overview the user overview

00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:58,970
are now views I think we are also in the

00:10:55,820 --> 00:11:00,740
process of changing the comment overview

00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:03,710
so basically everything is handled by

00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:06,020
views and also large parts of C tools

00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:07,279
have been moved into core things like

00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:10,100
plugins things like

00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:11,980
X portables drop buttons dialogue

00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:14,749
everything from the seagulls module

00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:16,730
which is kind of popular because every

00:11:14,749 --> 00:11:19,639
module in Drupal 7 more or less requires

00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:22,870
it that's in court right now so really

00:11:19,639 --> 00:11:25,699
really great stuff so besides views

00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:29,360
another great thing is filled a p.i and

00:11:25,699 --> 00:11:32,029
I have to say RIT about the Drupal 8

00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:35,749
cycle for field API was actually to go

00:11:32,029 --> 00:11:37,879
on vacation we were happy mean-field API

00:11:35,749 --> 00:11:40,790
is in core you can attach fields to your

00:11:37,879 --> 00:11:44,360
entities we have like basics feels like

00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:46,519
images files things like that so we were

00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:48,829
like okay you guys can alter your stuff

00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:52,279
we will fix some bugs here and there but

00:11:48,829 --> 00:11:54,050
our core my colleague for developers

00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:57,290
basically that's something else they

00:11:54,050 --> 00:12:00,199
rewrote all the things and that's kind

00:11:57,290 --> 00:12:02,089
of annoying there's so much new stuff in

00:12:00,199 --> 00:12:05,689
triple eight there's dependency

00:12:02,089 --> 00:12:07,970
injection these constraints plugins what

00:12:05,689 --> 00:12:13,939
else do we have we have a new entity API

00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:16,069
and my thing is working sorry we use

00:12:13,939 --> 00:12:18,559
object oriented code all over the place

00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:20,959
we use namespaces which is kind of cool

00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:23,300
we have this thing called configuration

00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:26,180
management initiative and we also wanted

00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:29,660
to move away from field storage to

00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:33,259
entity based storage so we had to do a

00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:35,000
lot of stuff and also which is really

00:12:33,259 --> 00:12:37,579
interesting it's the third time that we

00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,579
have been rewriting field API a little

00:12:37,579 --> 00:12:41,809
bit of history during Drupal 47 and

00:12:40,579 --> 00:12:44,569
triple five there was a new module

00:12:41,809 --> 00:12:46,100
called cck and actually before that we

00:12:44,569 --> 00:12:47,660
had a module called flexi note which

00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:50,240
also allowed you to create new content

00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:53,389
types and attach fields for some reason

00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:55,939
cck became more popular and during the

00:12:53,389 --> 00:12:58,459
Drupal 6 cycle when juries makes his new

00:12:55,939 --> 00:13:01,910
wish list it was like okay let's put cck

00:12:58,459 --> 00:13:03,679
into core so it was renamed to fill API

00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:05,870
so that was the second time and now we

00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:07,639
basically had to rewrite it again but a

00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:09,589
lot of exciting stuff have happened

00:13:07,639 --> 00:13:11,959
there we've added a lot of new field

00:13:09,589 --> 00:13:13,730
type things like entity reference which

00:13:11,959 --> 00:13:17,209
allows you to reference basically

00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:19,879
everything in your website we have a

00:13:17,209 --> 00:13:20,550
date field you can finally create event

00:13:19,879 --> 00:13:24,480
but

00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:26,190
for instance there's a link field email

00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,709
what the stuff do you have a telephone

00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:30,870
field if you watched the keynote from

00:13:28,709 --> 00:13:32,820
trees powerful stuff that we can do

00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:35,100
right now we have a picture field which

00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:37,019
is kind of a weird one the picture field

00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:39,240
uses the picture element which is

00:13:37,019 --> 00:13:41,940
actually not validated yet but we're

00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:44,790
drupal so we do stuff that doesn't yeah

00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:47,089
well it exists but it's still not valid

00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:50,070
yet what it does it allows you to select

00:13:47,089 --> 00:13:53,310
different image styles depending on the

00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:55,589
viewport so if you're looking on a let's

00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:57,750
say mobile phone the picture element

00:13:55,589 --> 00:14:00,390
will select like say the small image

00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:02,370
style if you look at on a desktop it

00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:04,470
will use the large image style so we

00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:07,019
have responsive images in core basically

00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:09,870
really great thing and user picture is

00:14:07,019 --> 00:14:13,370
finally a field user picturing before

00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:15,990
that was just a annoying thing which was

00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:17,700
horrible it was useless you can couldn't

00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:19,820
do anything useful with that it's a

00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:22,380
field it can have for matters it can be

00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:25,740
fantastic so a lot of new field types

00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:28,320
we've done a lot on field ey as well we

00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:31,320
finally have a UI in court that allows

00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:33,120
us to create new view modes and also for

00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:34,920
modes which is completely new which I'm

00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,410
will talk about in a couple of minutes

00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:39,630
we have placeholders which allows you to

00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:42,180
put a little text let's say in a text

00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:44,430
field for some guidance so let's say

00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:46,110
please enter your name here if you click

00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:48,450
on it and that will disappear and you

00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:50,730
just can start typing we have custom

00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:53,700
cardinality which is which was a pain

00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:56,300
for a lot of people in philippi I you

00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:58,970
were only allowed to either select

00:14:56,300 --> 00:15:00,959
unlimited items or from one to ten

00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:03,000
interpolate you can now finally have

00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:05,160
let's say 45 items if you want it

00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:08,399
doesn't really matter field prefix can

00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:10,620
be renamed and one thing that is

00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:12,390
important regarding to fielding why in

00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:14,520
the way that you are using or reusing

00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:16,800
fields fields cannot be used anymore

00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:19,800
across entity types which means that if

00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:22,380
you have a body field or let's say an

00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:24,240
image field you can still reuse that on

00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:27,029
different content types but you cannot

00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:30,480
reuse that same field on let's a comment

00:15:27,029 --> 00:15:33,660
or taxonomy which means you will have to

00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,440
create them at twice so you can have a

00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:37,170
field called ma

00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:40,440
um let's say your content types and also

00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:42,780
the same name on vocabularies this is

00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:44,610
you this is for entity based storage

00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:49,950
it's a really technical thing but it's

00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:53,220
for the best trust me so we have view

00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:55,440
and four modes we have now a UI in core

00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:57,540
to create new view modes it only took us

00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:00,240
three issues and a lot of bike shedding

00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:02,670
if you look at you I it's just a label

00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,890
and the Machine name I still don't

00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:07,140
understand why we've used three issues

00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:10,680
for that but it integrates perfectly

00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:14,100
with views and it also works on the form

00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:17,100
sign and what it means if you look at

00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:19,320
field you I you have a region on manage

00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:22,080
display which allows you to hide fields

00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:25,350
we basically mimic that for forms as

00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:27,390
well so on forms you used to have

00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:29,760
managed fields and in that place you

00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:33,030
would add new fields reuse new fields

00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:34,980
and also change the order you have a new

00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:37,650
tab which is called manage form display

00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:40,410
which just allows you to hide some

00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:42,600
fields there's a really interesting use

00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:46,350
case for that lets user register so in

00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:50,130
Drupal core we ship with 24 modes for

00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:52,830
the user its default and register which

00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:55,230
means that you can now finally stopped

00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:57,030
doing from altars in code if you want to

00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:59,310
move out some fields or add some fields

00:16:57,030 --> 00:17:02,040
and things like that and I wanted to

00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:07,050
show you that in a little video so how

00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:09,959
is it oh sorry does it start okay so

00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:11,699
this is the user registered registration

00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:15,180
page there's a couple of fields that

00:17:11,699 --> 00:17:20,569
have been added there and my video

00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:20,569
stopped for some open it okay I can see

00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:25,860
ok I'll have to do it like this little

00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:28,830
so you have managed display you have

00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:30,240
managed forumdisplay so what you can do

00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:33,600
and manage from this play it's basically

00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:36,500
the same as managed display and you see

00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:40,380
all the fields so this is default and

00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:42,540
and then we can go to register I'm also

00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:45,450
going to quickly show you the interface

00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:47,040
you can create new four modes but the

00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:47,940
only use case for record at this point

00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:50,279
is a user

00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:53,909
registration page so at this point we'll

00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:55,110
go to register and remove some I should

00:17:53,909 --> 00:17:58,230
have made my videos a little bit faster

00:17:55,110 --> 00:18:00,509
I think sorry about that but it's just

00:17:58,230 --> 00:18:03,269
so fun to play around with it so we just

00:18:00,509 --> 00:18:06,419
move stuff around which is really

00:18:03,269 --> 00:18:08,250
fantastic you click on save and then if

00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:10,049
we're going to go back to our user

00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:11,970
registration page and reload those

00:18:10,049 --> 00:18:17,129
fields will be gone so that's the basic

00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:19,320
concept let me go back here I'll

00:18:17,129 --> 00:18:22,320
probably have to do this again after

00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:25,259
with another video I might take a mic

00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:27,149
over there so really interesting and

00:18:25,259 --> 00:18:29,429
powerful stuff in country probably a

00:18:27,149 --> 00:18:32,129
module for instance like in line entity

00:18:29,429 --> 00:18:34,200
form will make much use of this because

00:18:32,129 --> 00:18:37,590
if you use in line entity form you get

00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:39,659
the same complete note form in sight

00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:42,360
another note form which is kind of a

00:18:39,659 --> 00:18:44,820
pain that will be much smoother right

00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:47,909
now so we can say goodbye income trip to

00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:49,529
a lot of modules all the field type

00:18:47,909 --> 00:18:51,299
modules that I've listed entity

00:18:49,529 --> 00:18:54,360
reference link email whatever they're

00:18:51,299 --> 00:18:56,220
all in core some parts might still be in

00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:58,200
concept for instance this date module

00:18:56,220 --> 00:19:00,120
not everything from the date module has

00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:02,820
been moved into core so things like

00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:06,929
recurring dates will still be handled in

00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:09,269
a contrib module references module is

00:19:06,929 --> 00:19:12,389
also a module which was basically the

00:19:09,269 --> 00:19:14,279
successor of entity oh sorry of user

00:19:12,389 --> 00:19:16,350
reference and node reference from cck

00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:18,840
which was already replaced by entity

00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:20,490
reference basically the view is mo modes

00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:22,710
module which allows you to create new

00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:24,690
view modes and four modes parts of

00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:27,029
display suite which also allows you to

00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:29,220
create new view modes and basically all

00:19:27,029 --> 00:19:32,700
hidden field widget modules I think

00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:35,850
there are around seven or eight modules

00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:37,740
in country bland that i'll try to allow

00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:39,269
you to have hidden widgets you don't

00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:44,639
need that anymore you can just move it

00:19:39,269 --> 00:19:47,820
out of the forum so with use and with

00:19:44,639 --> 00:19:50,570
field API we can finally come back to a

00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:53,309
concept called snowman snowman is a

00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:56,460
thought experiment by Jeff Eden and

00:19:53,309 --> 00:19:58,799
basically what he tried to do two years

00:19:56,460 --> 00:20:01,320
ago will try and figure out whether you

00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:03,840
could create a distribution or install

00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:07,230
profile with Drupal core alone so only

00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:09,269
triple core and no country modules turn

00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:11,250
out at that time we were still working

00:20:09,269 --> 00:20:14,250
on Drupal 7 none of the stuff that I

00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:16,259
talked about until now was it was not in

00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:19,200
course so he basically couldn't do

00:20:16,259 --> 00:20:22,970
anything but now it's finally useful

00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:25,500
Jeff Eden is really happy today finally

00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:27,299
he's talking about that if you're

00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:29,730
interested he's talking with together

00:20:27,299 --> 00:20:32,250
with Royce Colton from the user

00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:36,110
experience team he talks about it

00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:38,879
tomorrow it's a core core conversation

00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:40,950
domi scale perfect core conversation are

00:20:38,879 --> 00:20:42,360
actually pretty nice and Jeff eaten and

00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:43,679
we are really nice people so if you're

00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:46,590
interested in that they're going to talk

00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:49,019
about Drupal 8 and the power of Drupal 8

00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:54,809
even more than I'm trying to explain to

00:20:49,019 --> 00:20:57,360
you guys so blocks and layouts so if

00:20:54,809 --> 00:21:00,929
you're increases keynote reese's

00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:04,980
Audrey's also mentioned it's basically

00:21:00,929 --> 00:21:06,419
only blocks the layouts part of what we

00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:09,210
were trying to do didn't really make it

00:21:06,419 --> 00:21:11,700
into Drupal core but we've done some

00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:14,159
nice things we can finally have multiple

00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:18,120
instances of a block it was impossible

00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:21,360
until now you need to use a module likes

00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:24,059
a context or use page manager and panels

00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:25,919
to have multiple versions of one block

00:21:24,059 --> 00:21:28,710
that's finally possible we have an

00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:31,559
improved UI and we also have feel double

00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:34,529
blocks so you could create a custom

00:21:31,559 --> 00:21:36,990
block in Drupal 7 which only allows you

00:21:34,529 --> 00:21:38,610
to add a title antibody in Triple H you

00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:40,980
can add new fields to them and you can

00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:46,350
actually have multiple custom block

00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:47,820
types so great stuff I think I'm now

00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:58,610
going to show a video and i'll probably

00:21:47,820 --> 00:22:04,320
have to do it like this again so ok ok

00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:07,110
hmm blocks or entities ok so the UI has

00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:08,460
been improved one good thing is it only

00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:10,559
lists the blocks that you are actually

00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:13,409
using because if you would have a lot of

00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:15,000
blocks it would actually sometimes Java

00:22:13,409 --> 00:22:16,860
JavaScript would stop

00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:20,010
you have a little search bar on the

00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:22,500
right and then you just select the blog

00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:25,380
that you want and just save it and then

00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:27,480
reload it of course so this is an

00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:29,220
example of adding the who's online blog

00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:31,620
and just to show you that we can

00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:33,720
actually use multiple instances of one

00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:37,160
block I'm going to add the search form

00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:42,240
I'm going to put it in the right sidebar

00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:43,980
and then you now can have finally

00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:46,770
multiple instances of a block which is

00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:50,000
really really fantastic stuff you can do

00:22:46,770 --> 00:22:52,530
goofy things as well if you want to the

00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:55,950
main page content is actually a block

00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:58,380
you can do stupid stuff like this but

00:22:55,950 --> 00:23:00,720
fantastic so we can say goodbye in

00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:04,230
contrib to fillable panels pains and

00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:06,000
beans module it's in core we don't need

00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:08,010
con trip anymore basically for Drupal 8

00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:11,670
which is kind of cool there's a

00:23:08,010 --> 00:23:14,130
fantastic session about blocks tomorrow

00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:16,920
also by frederick model he's talking

00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:20,520
about a history of blocks from Drupal 8

00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:22,890
point at one point no.02 aimpoint but

00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:25,530
basically today it's really fantastic to

00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:27,480
look at how the UI of blocks has been

00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:29,130
changed over the course of time so if

00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:33,590
you're interested in that really go

00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:37,050
watch it so let's see what next

00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:39,840
multilingual I could talk for hours

00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:42,120
about multilingual because i'm from

00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:44,460
belgium everything i need to create a

00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:45,930
website it's usually two languages it's

00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:48,930
usually Dutch and French and then

00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:50,780
usually we also need to add english and

00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:53,880
then sometimes german as well it's

00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:56,100
painful it's and its really an

00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:58,830
understatement in Drupal 7 in triple

00:23:56,100 --> 00:24:01,740
seven you basically need to enable at

00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:04,470
least five or six extra modules from the

00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:07,500
internationalization module that is all

00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:09,960
in core right now basically or more or

00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:12,780
less but there are four pillars of

00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:14,760
change basically the first pillar is

00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:17,580
language it means that everything in

00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:19,830
triple core has a language whether it's

00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:21,960
a stupid string like say your site

00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:24,030
information it has a language that was

00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:26,160
the basis to make sure that we could add

00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:28,860
more multilingual support to Drupal core

00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:31,770
the interface has been changed a lot it

00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:34,950
a little bit more friendly really

00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:37,799
important change is the move removed

00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:39,750
entity translation module into core and

00:24:37,799 --> 00:24:42,540
we deprecated the content translation

00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:44,370
module it means that if you have for

00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:47,220
instance five or six languages and you

00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:49,140
want to translate one node you would

00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:51,510
still have one node so it doesn't create

00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:54,660
new notes so that's the way that entry

00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:58,049
translation module works fantastic it

00:24:54,660 --> 00:25:00,299
works on every entity so not only your

00:24:58,049 --> 00:25:02,190
content is translatable but also your

00:25:00,299 --> 00:25:04,500
taxonomy terms and your comment are

00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:07,020
translatable basically every T every

00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:09,059
entity that is in core or if you have

00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:10,740
your own custom entities they will be

00:25:09,059 --> 00:25:12,809
translatable out of the box you don't

00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:15,240
have to do anything to make them

00:25:12,809 --> 00:25:17,700
translatable which is great news another

00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:19,679
great thing is configuration can now

00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:22,320
also be translated for the first time in

00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:25,470
Drupal history you can translate your

00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:27,510
site slogan or your site name to a

00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:30,000
different language you needed to enable

00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:32,970
or you need to enable four modules for

00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:36,419
that in Drupal 7 which is ridiculous in

00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:38,880
my opinion great news one of the other

00:25:36,419 --> 00:25:39,840
one nice thing also about your

00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,820
translation the configuration

00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:44,190
translation is the fact that that

00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:46,260
translation is written to files so you

00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:48,210
cannot actually also deploy it really

00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:50,700
nicely it's not stored into the database

00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:52,919
fantastic news there's one module that

00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:57,240
we still need to pull into core which is

00:25:52,919 --> 00:26:00,270
called config translation it will allow

00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:02,130
it will allow us to translate dynamic

00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:06,390
configuration what I mean by that is you

00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:09,240
when you have a let's say a block which

00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:10,710
is shipped within core core will be able

00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:12,870
to translate it if you create a new

00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:15,240
block core cannot translate it by

00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:17,250
default so we need a additional module

00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:19,350
but basically in triple eight you will

00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:22,740
only need to enable three modules and

00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:25,799
they are n core fantastic news we can

00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:27,990
ditch internationalization finally Gabor

00:26:25,799 --> 00:26:30,030
is talking about that today at one

00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:31,620
o'clock if you're interested in

00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:33,540
multilingual and I think everyone from

00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:35,190
Europe is should be interested in that

00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:37,260
you should really watch this session and

00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:39,179
then just play around with Drupal 8 with

00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:41,700
all the translation stuff there's a lot

00:26:39,179 --> 00:26:42,659
of things still to do for translation in

00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:45,960
triple core if you

00:26:42,659 --> 00:26:48,840
interested at help out go to go Bor go

00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:52,429
to go to Cathy they will be really glad

00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:55,590
if you help them out something

00:26:52,429 --> 00:26:59,340
revolutionary as well in Drupal we have

00:26:55,590 --> 00:27:01,440
a WYSIWYG editor in core it ships with

00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:03,269
core at some point during the release

00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:05,159
cycle we were trying to figure out

00:27:03,269 --> 00:27:08,340
whether we were you going to use Aloha

00:27:05,159 --> 00:27:10,529
we went for a sickie editor for several

00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:13,049
reasons it has style integration with

00:27:10,529 --> 00:27:16,409
text formats and it also has inline

00:27:13,049 --> 00:27:18,090
image uploads and the only way that I

00:27:16,409 --> 00:27:22,259
can show you that nice league is with a

00:27:18,090 --> 00:27:24,720
fantastic video so let me show you that

00:27:22,259 --> 00:27:27,690
so we are on the node article screen and

00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:30,659
we ship with a editor and you see the

00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:32,460
buttons over there if you switch from

00:27:30,659 --> 00:27:34,049
text format then you will have different

00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:37,320
buttons so there's tight integration

00:27:34,049 --> 00:27:39,379
with the text formats if you configure

00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:42,210
your text formats you can actually just

00:27:39,379 --> 00:27:45,059
configure the buttons or do the things

00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:48,539
that you want to allow you just drag and

00:27:45,059 --> 00:27:51,359
drop them in it will also update the

00:27:48,539 --> 00:27:52,710
allowed HTML thanks immediately for you

00:27:51,359 --> 00:27:56,279
you don't have to think about that

00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:58,379
anymore so you're just save and then you

00:27:56,279 --> 00:28:00,599
have your new buttons and it actually

00:27:58,379 --> 00:28:02,129
works so I'm going to add a title

00:28:00,599 --> 00:28:05,879
because you cannot save in your bravado

00:28:02,129 --> 00:28:10,019
title and then you just start creating

00:28:05,879 --> 00:28:12,749
your content one nice thing and this is

00:28:10,019 --> 00:28:15,659
relatively new as well you can also now

00:28:12,749 --> 00:28:18,239
upload images in line within the editor

00:28:15,659 --> 00:28:20,369
so you don't have to have your L or

00:28:18,239 --> 00:28:22,049
something like that you can also add

00:28:20,369 --> 00:28:26,609
captions and things like that so you

00:28:22,049 --> 00:28:29,549
select an image and then you just

00:28:26,609 --> 00:28:32,009
basically save it right you can add a

00:28:29,549 --> 00:28:35,369
caption so if you go down you can add

00:28:32,009 --> 00:28:37,679
and change that if you want to really

00:28:35,369 --> 00:28:41,460
nice stuff in my opinion and it ships

00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:43,349
with core not a nice thing it also knows

00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:46,279
or integrates with the breakpoints

00:28:43,349 --> 00:28:50,159
module which means that if I would start

00:28:46,279 --> 00:28:52,049
of if I would look at this note on a

00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:54,599
mobile device the image will actually

00:28:52,049 --> 00:28:56,610
also resize as well so integration is

00:28:54,599 --> 00:28:59,190
really tight there is

00:28:56,610 --> 00:29:01,920
well so really great stuff from the

00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:04,470
wysiwyg team so we can say goodbye in

00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:07,250
country again through a lot of modules

00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:10,799
we can say goodbye to the wysiwyg module

00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:12,990
the insert module more or less and there

00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:15,690
were also a lot of various standalone

00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:19,860
WYSIWYG modules we don't need contrib

00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:28,110
anymore to have markup we also have

00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:30,210
inline editing because content if you

00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:31,860
can have a really nice site which has a

00:29:30,210 --> 00:29:34,640
nice configuration if you don't have

00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:38,100
content your site is useless so and

00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:40,320
editing that content can be quite

00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:42,210
tedious tedious sometimes so the Edit

00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:45,900
module integrates with field API and it

00:29:42,210 --> 00:29:47,910
means that every field that you create

00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:50,330
will be automatically in line editable

00:29:47,910 --> 00:29:53,220
on the front end of your website it also

00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:56,850
integrates with other properties things

00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:59,130
like title basically at this point it

00:29:56,850 --> 00:30:04,380
doesn't work yet but we cannot ship

00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:06,870
Drupal 8 and don't love yes I know but

00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:08,490
we cannot ship Drupal 8 if you cannot

00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:10,260
edit the title on your phone that we

00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:12,390
have been discussing that for a whole

00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:15,690
weekend and we finally have a plan to

00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:18,660
made it made that work hopefully but it

00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:20,130
works basically also on any page for

00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:22,169
that I also made a little video because

00:30:20,130 --> 00:30:28,260
it's so freaking Lee cool to show that

00:30:22,169 --> 00:30:29,730
so we're on a node page and we you just

00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:32,490
have to click on a contextual link and

00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:34,230
then you can go to am going head

00:30:32,490 --> 00:30:36,990
actually I don't see it okay we go to

00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:39,330
the body what's also nice is that you

00:30:36,990 --> 00:30:42,600
now see the buttons from your editor as

00:30:39,330 --> 00:30:44,610
well so you don't have to think about

00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:48,809
adding your own markup of things like

00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:52,559
that works perfectly fine you can also

00:30:48,809 --> 00:30:59,299
change the image if you want to so again

00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:59,299
go to quick edit click on the image and

00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:05,250
remove it and then you can actually just

00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:06,600
upload a new one so it's really really

00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:09,720
easy just to browse around in your

00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:10,320
website now and just change content

00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:13,769
every

00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:15,659
we're so this is on the note page if you

00:31:13,769 --> 00:31:17,669
would look at the front page it works

00:31:15,659 --> 00:31:20,370
there as well we are looking at a teaser

00:31:17,669 --> 00:31:22,110
we don't have to care or think what kind

00:31:20,370 --> 00:31:24,299
of content this is you don't have to go

00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:26,370
to the admin content screen or you don't

00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:28,679
have to go to the Edit screen of sorry

00:31:26,370 --> 00:31:31,409
of the note you can directly edit it on

00:31:28,679 --> 00:31:35,600
the front page which is fantastically

00:31:31,409 --> 00:31:38,549
great so let's see inline editing module

00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:41,789
great stuff now something completely

00:31:38,549 --> 00:31:44,039
different configuration management I've

00:31:41,789 --> 00:31:46,110
talked about dresses dream eliminating

00:31:44,039 --> 00:31:49,889
the developer design your things like

00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:51,570
that i can add something to that I maybe

00:31:49,889 --> 00:31:53,730
should tell him that he can add

00:31:51,570 --> 00:31:56,419
something new let's try and get rid of

00:31:53,730 --> 00:32:00,029
the system administrator more or less

00:31:56,419 --> 00:32:02,789
but basically in Drupal 8 all your

00:32:00,029 --> 00:32:04,919
configuration is now stored in files so

00:32:02,789 --> 00:32:07,169
when you are configuring your website

00:32:04,919 --> 00:32:10,559
all of that configuration is written

00:32:07,169 --> 00:32:13,529
into files and we have a UI in triple

00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:15,899
core to export your configuration and

00:32:13,529 --> 00:32:18,750
then go to a different version and then

00:32:15,899 --> 00:32:21,990
import it again the only way to show you

00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:25,950
that is again with video so what we are

00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:28,559
doing is we are going when it starts

00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:31,350
we're basically going I have two

00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:33,210
versions so I have a deaf and a

00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:35,879
prediction for instance i'm going to

00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:39,539
change the site name to something

00:32:35,879 --> 00:32:42,720
completely different and i'm also going

00:32:39,539 --> 00:32:44,279
to create a content type so basically

00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:46,980
everything in triple core is now

00:32:44,279 --> 00:32:49,470
deployable you don't need features or

00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:51,929
things like that all variables things

00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:54,299
like that you can just basically import

00:32:51,929 --> 00:32:56,850
and export them by yourself which means

00:32:54,299 --> 00:32:58,590
that you don't if you don't want to you

00:32:56,850 --> 00:33:01,590
don't need to commit your configuration

00:32:58,590 --> 00:33:03,120
and things like that you should because

00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:07,559
it's interesting to have everything in

00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:09,659
VCS somewhere so what you have to do is

00:33:07,559 --> 00:33:12,110
you go to configuration there is a

00:33:09,659 --> 00:33:15,809
config module which is basically a UI

00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:19,350
which allows you to import and export so

00:33:15,809 --> 00:33:22,649
it's let me see okay let's go to

00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:24,029
configuration underneath nested

00:33:22,649 --> 00:33:25,859
underneath development you

00:33:24,029 --> 00:33:29,070
configuration export import and

00:33:25,859 --> 00:33:30,899
synchronize so what we now just have to

00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:33,450
do is configuration export there's just

00:33:30,899 --> 00:33:35,249
an export button there you click on it

00:33:33,450 --> 00:33:37,049
and what you get is the complete

00:33:35,249 --> 00:33:40,080
configuration of your website if you

00:33:37,049 --> 00:33:41,789
would open up the downloaded file you

00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:44,580
would see all the files that are in

00:33:41,789 --> 00:33:46,469
there which is kind of great it used to

00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:49,019
be all this stuff used to be in in a

00:33:46,469 --> 00:33:50,609
database somewhere which is horrible to

00:33:49,019 --> 00:33:52,710
figure out where something is stored

00:33:50,609 --> 00:33:55,259
there's some serializable crap and

00:33:52,710 --> 00:34:00,419
things like that it's now nicely in a

00:33:55,259 --> 00:34:01,799
file okay so we have downloaded we go to

00:34:00,419 --> 00:34:04,409
our production website we go to

00:34:01,799 --> 00:34:05,789
configuration and then basically the

00:34:04,409 --> 00:34:09,510
only thing that you need to do is go to

00:34:05,789 --> 00:34:11,879
import and upload that file so what will

00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:14,940
happen at this point Drupal will show a

00:34:11,879 --> 00:34:17,129
screen with all the other new things

00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:20,579
things that have been changed or deleted

00:34:17,129 --> 00:34:23,460
and you can also look at changes

00:34:20,579 --> 00:34:27,210
actually we have a diff in core so if we

00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:31,049
click on the site we will see that site

00:34:27,210 --> 00:34:32,520
name has actually been changed and then

00:34:31,049 --> 00:34:35,730
the only thing that you now have to do

00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:38,490
is click on import all and now Drupal

00:34:35,730 --> 00:34:40,770
will install that configuration for you

00:34:38,490 --> 00:34:43,049
which is kind of great so we can kill

00:34:40,770 --> 00:34:46,950
the deploy guy or something like that

00:34:43,049 --> 00:34:50,450
you we don't hopefully there are no

00:34:46,950 --> 00:34:50,450
system administrators here I don't know

00:34:52,669 --> 00:34:58,250
could we do questions later all right

00:34:58,549 --> 00:35:04,829
one really good advice from Alex pot our

00:35:02,849 --> 00:35:06,839
core committer don't hack your active

00:35:04,829 --> 00:35:08,970
config I mean by that it's really

00:35:06,839 --> 00:35:11,339
tempting nowadays to go into your files

00:35:08,970 --> 00:35:14,579
directory because your configuration is

00:35:11,339 --> 00:35:16,529
in files it's extremely tempting to open

00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:18,119
it up and then just start changing

00:35:16,529 --> 00:35:20,309
something and then magically hope that

00:35:18,119 --> 00:35:22,770
everything will be okay it will not be

00:35:20,309 --> 00:35:24,359
okay it might be okay for site

00:35:22,770 --> 00:35:27,660
information and things like that but

00:35:24,359 --> 00:35:30,720
especially for stuff like fields and

00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:32,520
instances views as well there it needs

00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:34,980
to be some additional processing

00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:36,779
happening so either use import and

00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:37,740
export there will also be additional

00:35:36,779 --> 00:35:40,590
tools that

00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:42,630
come out that will crickets and and

00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:45,210
stuff like that but don't hack your

00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:47,730
active config because otherwise you will

00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:49,320
get into a lot of trouble so we can say

00:35:47,730 --> 00:35:50,880
goodbye in contrib to a lot of stuff

00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:58,400
again we can say goodbye to features

00:35:50,880 --> 00:36:01,050
module everybody cheer who actually the

00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:03,810
role of the features module will change

00:36:01,050 --> 00:36:06,090
a little in Drupal 8 it will still exist

00:36:03,810 --> 00:36:09,980
but it will actually do what it was

00:36:06,090 --> 00:36:12,869
intended for being a package manager

00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:15,450
everyone abuses features in court just

00:36:12,869 --> 00:36:17,970
to move over they complete configuration

00:36:15,450 --> 00:36:19,350
that doesn't need any more Seto selects

00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:22,080
portables again from the sea tools

00:36:19,350 --> 00:36:24,270
module upgrade code and you can also say

00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:26,250
goodbye to napkins I mean everyone has

00:36:24,270 --> 00:36:29,130
just written down stuff on a paper

00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:31,290
somewhere and then okay remember this go

00:36:29,130 --> 00:36:33,510
to production I've forgotten that and

00:36:31,290 --> 00:36:37,560
whatever it happens I've done that

00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:40,680
everyone does that don't worry so so

00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:44,790
little some little gems things that make

00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:47,700
life especially easier we have services

00:36:44,790 --> 00:36:50,940
in core which sounds weird but it allows

00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:52,619
us to move country modules again out of

00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:54,150
the way it has fantastic view support

00:36:52,619 --> 00:36:56,100
with me which means that you as a side

00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:58,230
boiler you can expose your content as a

00:36:56,100 --> 00:37:01,050
service so that someone else can access

00:36:58,230 --> 00:37:03,840
it for instance for Android or whatever

00:37:01,050 --> 00:37:05,970
platform really great stuff we have

00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:13,350
multiple upload for the first time in

00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:17,580
Drupal history um yay and we removed the

00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:19,380
upload button it's HX but so basically

00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:21,900
if you just choose a file select a

00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:23,970
picture or whatever it will start

00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:26,690
uploading it for you automatically you

00:37:23,970 --> 00:37:31,080
don't need to click less clicks great

00:37:26,690 --> 00:37:34,080
azeri is also mentioned in his keynote

00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:35,820
we have a tour module which is basically

00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:39,180
more or less a replacement for the help

00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:40,859
module nobody reads help basically no

00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:42,540
one because also they're helping core

00:37:40,859 --> 00:37:44,400
modules or even concrete modules is

00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:45,980
extremely outdated the tour module

00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:49,290
allows us to give a visual

00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:51,540
interpretation and help us give a nicer

00:37:49,290 --> 00:37:53,970
overview we also have a responsive

00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:57,060
bar might sound wave from the site

00:37:53,970 --> 00:37:58,980
building perspective but if you would do

00:37:57,060 --> 00:38:01,770
side building on your iPad and things

00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:05,730
like that it is actually pretty nice you

00:38:01,770 --> 00:38:10,470
can also search modules it's quite a

00:38:05,730 --> 00:38:13,700
pain in the ass if you yeah I should

00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:15,930
have started with this apparently

00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:17,580
fantastic day I don't know the name of

00:38:15,930 --> 00:38:19,530
the module that is in contrib that also

00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:22,680
gives us the functionality but it's now

00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:24,960
in court for the developers if you are

00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:27,360
doing tests you can also search for

00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:30,900
tests on a simple test page which is

00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:33,180
also really great so we also also always

00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:35,280
say goodbye to core modules within every

00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:39,630
release for various reasons because

00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:41,300
either they're outdated or maybe nobody

00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:44,280
is interested in maintaining them so

00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:50,480
modules like Paul trigger open ID block

00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:54,030
the PHP filter is gone from core okay

00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:57,210
maybe you use that don't use beach be

00:38:54,030 --> 00:38:58,830
really especially in your like saying

00:38:57,210 --> 00:39:02,130
visibility of blocks or things like that

00:38:58,830 --> 00:39:05,070
and also the profile module has been

00:39:02,130 --> 00:39:07,050
removed people advice to use profile to

00:39:05,070 --> 00:39:08,760
of course it doesn't exist yet at this

00:39:07,050 --> 00:39:11,550
point for Drupal 8 so if someone's

00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:17,220
interested to give more power to user

00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:23,340
profiles please help along so how is

00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:25,380
contributing we try to advise people to

00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:28,410
start playing around with the API and

00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:31,230
start pouring their modules to Drupal 8

00:39:28,410 --> 00:39:34,020
so we can actually figure out whether I

00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:35,820
SAR working on up so I know a couple of

00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:38,700
them I'm biased of course display suite

00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:41,130
is working for Drupal 8 with some bumps

00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:44,490
now and then but we follow really really

00:39:41,130 --> 00:39:45,990
closely we know there's a port on the

00:39:44,490 --> 00:39:48,420
way for a field group as well I know

00:39:45,990 --> 00:39:51,150
that Google Analytics for instance is

00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:53,310
working one of the unknown things at

00:39:51,150 --> 00:39:55,290
this point is that I have no idea what

00:39:53,310 --> 00:39:57,330
is going to happen for instance to page

00:39:55,290 --> 00:40:00,750
manager and panels for people who are

00:39:57,330 --> 00:40:02,940
using that we were promised to have more

00:40:00,750 --> 00:40:05,130
or less layouts and the notion of page

00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:07,349
manager in Drupal 8 cord that's

00:40:05,130 --> 00:40:09,269
obviously not really going to happen so

00:40:07,349 --> 00:40:11,730
someone will need to step up and then

00:40:09,269 --> 00:40:14,789
basically port page manager which will

00:40:11,730 --> 00:40:16,380
be a really large task so the sooner we

00:40:14,789 --> 00:40:18,509
start so if you're interested in that if

00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:20,039
you're using that either help out or

00:40:18,509 --> 00:40:22,319
talk to the people that maintain a

00:40:20,039 --> 00:40:25,980
module try to figure out whether you can

00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:28,529
help them or not in any way token you I

00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:30,269
and path auto are also one of those

00:40:28,529 --> 00:40:32,369
modules that I usually use I'm not sure

00:40:30,269 --> 00:40:35,430
about the status at this point but

00:40:32,369 --> 00:40:38,460
basically jibril 8 is really going to

00:40:35,430 --> 00:40:40,170
rock we've moved so much stuff into

00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:43,349
Drupal core in terms of side building

00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:46,170
it's amazing I think that you can do

00:40:43,349 --> 00:40:49,440
really basic websites at this point so

00:40:46,170 --> 00:40:51,450
Drupal 8 it will be out when it's ready

00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:54,000
but it's going to be fantastic for every

00:40:51,450 --> 00:40:56,430
site builder out there so if you have

00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:59,220
any questions you can go over to the mic

00:40:56,430 --> 00:41:02,480
over there and then i'll try to answer

00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:02,480
your question

00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:16,060
I you had when you were showing the the

00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:17,680
WYSIWYG dreese had mentioned in his

00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:19,930
speech that there was a way to the

00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:21,700
simple 5 Adam wouldn't show the text

00:41:19,930 --> 00:41:23,290
formats but your example had the text

00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:28,300
format there's a way to hide that

00:41:23,290 --> 00:41:30,089
somewhere or what is what hmm good

00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:34,690
question I actually haven't tested it

00:41:30,089 --> 00:41:36,250
I'm I'm not sure sign in Drupal this was

00:41:34,690 --> 00:41:38,710
a standard install installation of

00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:41,500
course which comes with three or four

00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:43,390
text formats by default I think if you

00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:44,830
would remove them I'm not sure what's

00:41:43,390 --> 00:41:47,230
going to happen so I should test it

00:41:44,830 --> 00:41:49,930
myself I think the only way to get rid

00:41:47,230 --> 00:41:53,470
of it this probably form altar sadly

00:41:49,930 --> 00:42:00,780
enough or hide it or whatever i don't

00:41:53,470 --> 00:42:00,780
know but i actually don't know so sorry

00:42:00,930 --> 00:42:11,859
hi what happens to file entity yes a

00:42:08,770 --> 00:42:15,609
good question um files are still not

00:42:11,859 --> 00:42:18,150
feel double we're I know that Dave Reed

00:42:15,609 --> 00:42:21,640
has been trying to get file management

00:42:18,150 --> 00:42:23,830
forward in Drupal core not not much

00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:25,800
happened there so that will still be a

00:42:23,830 --> 00:42:28,240
solution within con trip sadly enough

00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:29,710
but I think that it's going to be

00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:31,560
something for triple 9 but of course

00:42:29,710 --> 00:42:34,890
we're waiting for Drupal 8 at this point

00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:38,560
but yeah file file management has been

00:42:34,890 --> 00:42:40,810
been modernized in terms of API but

00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:42,520
you're wise there's not much of course

00:42:40,810 --> 00:42:44,109
you can use file uploads within the

00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:46,599
editor of course and we actually also

00:42:44,109 --> 00:42:48,400
know if you upload a file there we can't

00:42:46,599 --> 00:42:55,450
we know it's direct and things like that

00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:59,079
but that's basically it so thank you any

00:42:55,450 --> 00:43:05,529
other questions okay

00:42:59,079 --> 00:43:07,209
should sing my question him do you know

00:43:05,529 --> 00:43:10,630
anything about the status of dress yet

00:43:07,209 --> 00:43:15,279
for drupal 8 um well drush has been

00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:17,709
moved to github so if you might actually

00:43:15,279 --> 00:43:19,989
want to try josh with drupal 8 you have

00:43:17,709 --> 00:43:22,539
to check out the master branch and then

00:43:19,989 --> 00:43:23,890
it works perfectly fine i know'd rush at

00:43:22,539 --> 00:43:26,380
this point has some commands for

00:43:23,890 --> 00:43:28,450
instance to you run the import from

00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:30,609
configuration management it also has a

00:43:28,450 --> 00:43:32,259
command to edit your configuration from

00:43:30,609 --> 00:43:34,119
command line and it opens up your

00:43:32,259 --> 00:43:36,640
favorite command line editor and then

00:43:34,119 --> 00:43:39,099
does all the processing of saving and

00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:42,509
stuff like that so drush works with

00:43:39,099 --> 00:43:45,099
drupal 8 again with some bumps sometimes

00:43:42,509 --> 00:43:47,229
because for instance maybe that's also a

00:43:45,099 --> 00:43:49,749
really big change at this point which I

00:43:47,229 --> 00:43:52,390
didn't include it in my slide since

00:43:49,749 --> 00:43:54,489
three or four days ago you cannot

00:43:52,390 --> 00:43:56,709
disable modules anymore in Drupal 8

00:43:54,489 --> 00:43:59,200
which is kind of weird there's a really

00:43:56,709 --> 00:44:00,579
technical reason for that so the only

00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:04,029
thing that you can do is install modules

00:44:00,579 --> 00:44:06,809
and uninstall we are still discussing to

00:44:04,029 --> 00:44:09,519
bring some kind of disabled stayed back

00:44:06,809 --> 00:44:11,499
so in that sense drush at that point was

00:44:09,519 --> 00:44:13,930
broken because module enable function

00:44:11,499 --> 00:44:19,839
didn't exist anymore for instance but

00:44:13,930 --> 00:44:22,509
they follow up closely so you showed

00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:24,759
that you can export the configuration

00:44:22,509 --> 00:44:27,009
but only the whole configuration is any

00:44:24,759 --> 00:44:29,469
way to select which part of the

00:44:27,009 --> 00:44:32,079
configuration export and no use from

00:44:29,469 --> 00:44:34,900
features yes yeah so did the model in

00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:37,420
jable Drupal core is you cannot do

00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:40,329
partial import imports which means that

00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:44,559
if I would move let's say one

00:44:40,329 --> 00:44:46,359
configuration file from you have two

00:44:44,559 --> 00:44:48,640
directories basically you have an active

00:44:46,359 --> 00:44:51,430
directory and a staging directory you

00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:53,109
put the files that you want to deploy in

00:44:51,430 --> 00:44:56,019
your staging directory if you would only

00:44:53,109 --> 00:44:58,089
put one in there then the synchronized

00:44:56,019 --> 00:44:59,799
configuration page will tell you okay I

00:44:58,089 --> 00:45:02,769
have something new or something changed

00:44:59,799 --> 00:45:05,229
and it will delete the rest so triple

00:45:02,769 --> 00:45:07,359
core only supports partial imports at

00:45:05,229 --> 00:45:09,849
this point everything is pluggable so I

00:45:07,359 --> 00:45:11,709
know that someone will work on this in

00:45:09,849 --> 00:45:12,130
contrib somewhere and make it happen

00:45:11,709 --> 00:45:13,750
that

00:45:12,130 --> 00:45:15,610
you can select individual files on that

00:45:13,750 --> 00:45:20,920
but the model in core is you have to

00:45:15,610 --> 00:45:24,490
deploy everything and at once so I'm

00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:27,310
glad you mentioned that in do pal 8 it's

00:45:24,490 --> 00:45:29,230
not possible to disable modules so could

00:45:27,310 --> 00:45:31,150
you tell some more about it how will we

00:45:29,230 --> 00:45:35,320
manage our modules and what does it mean

00:45:31,150 --> 00:45:37,320
for site builders well it means for one

00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:40,890
that you cannot disable modules anymore

00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:43,540
it means that if you uninstall a module

00:45:40,890 --> 00:45:45,130
what happens at this point the

00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:46,960
configuration system in case errors

00:45:45,130 --> 00:45:48,730
configuration will delete the complete

00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:52,000
configuration we did which is kind of

00:45:48,730 --> 00:45:53,650
annoying of course but there are a lot

00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:56,530
of technical reasons especially for the

00:45:53,650 --> 00:45:59,110
configuration management to remove that

00:45:56,530 --> 00:46:01,090
feature now again don't worry we have

00:45:59,110 --> 00:46:04,570
criticals actually in the queue to bring

00:46:01,090 --> 00:46:06,100
some kind of stayed back so that

00:46:04,570 --> 00:46:07,510
actually if something goes wrong with

00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:09,160
the contract module or whatever that you

00:46:07,510 --> 00:46:11,200
can disable and figure out whether it's

00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:16,180
that conflict module that break

00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:19,480
something so I don't know at this point

00:46:16,180 --> 00:46:21,730
so I think we'll have something back but

00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:23,560
it won't be like a say a permanent state

00:46:21,730 --> 00:46:26,250
or things like that at this point

00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:29,410
actually enabling or disabling modules

00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:31,570
which is still broken in that sense for

00:46:29,410 --> 00:46:33,490
configuration import and export if if I

00:46:31,570 --> 00:46:34,570
would enable a module in my dev

00:46:33,490 --> 00:46:36,460
environment and then move that

00:46:34,570 --> 00:46:39,240
configuration to production it doesn't

00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:42,520
work at this point so one of those

00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:45,040
critical critical things was the actual

00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:47,320
enable/disable and there's a lot of

00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:50,890
other reasons why we had to remove with

00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:57,220
it but we're still discussing it it's

00:46:50,890 --> 00:47:00,070
being a painful issue with fusing sorry

00:46:57,220 --> 00:47:03,040
with fusing core is there a possibility

00:47:00,070 --> 00:47:05,800
to the admin pages are they already in

00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:08,770
views so you can add filters and stuff

00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:13,090
to it yes course ships with admin

00:47:08,770 --> 00:47:18,220
content I also Tim the fuse also already

00:47:13,090 --> 00:47:21,480
take over the user page yeah okay so

00:47:18,220 --> 00:47:21,480
there are defaulting fuse

00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:25,989
regarding the multiple blocks how does

00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:27,759
that play with for my DS like for

00:47:25,989 --> 00:47:30,579
instance if you put the search form form

00:47:27,759 --> 00:47:35,980
on the page twice is the ID made unique

00:47:30,579 --> 00:47:38,799
or not good question I it should be I if

00:47:35,980 --> 00:47:42,940
I remember correctly when when in the

00:47:38,799 --> 00:47:45,880
API somewhere Drupal core will make sure

00:47:42,940 --> 00:47:47,380
that it will generate an unique ID I'm

00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:51,299
pretty sure of that it will work I

00:47:47,380 --> 00:47:51,299
should test it but I'm pretty sure of it

00:47:52,170 --> 00:48:01,119
hello oh sorry is there anything in

00:47:58,059 --> 00:48:02,859
Drupal 8 to automate content backups

00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:09,099
something like the back up in my great

00:48:02,859 --> 00:48:10,690
module um no color no no um maybe one

00:48:09,099 --> 00:48:13,690
interesting thing is that everything

00:48:10,690 --> 00:48:17,170
every piece of content in core now has a

00:48:13,690 --> 00:48:19,450
you wit ID but there is no you why for

00:48:17,170 --> 00:48:20,859
instance to move content from one side

00:48:19,450 --> 00:48:26,130
to another that will be something for

00:48:20,859 --> 00:48:26,130
contrib but there's no backup solution

00:48:26,430 --> 00:48:33,039
geez in his keynote mentioned that the

00:48:30,190 --> 00:48:35,319
number one goal for d8 is working at a

00:48:33,039 --> 00:48:36,910
performance mm-hmm they're kind of

00:48:35,319 --> 00:48:39,730
suggested there it's maybe a little

00:48:36,910 --> 00:48:48,309
heavier than p7 could you comment on

00:48:39,730 --> 00:48:49,769
that well I think I mean moving like all

00:48:48,309 --> 00:48:52,329
the conflict modules decor doesn't

00:48:49,769 --> 00:48:54,249
really affect performance in that sense

00:48:52,329 --> 00:48:56,440
if you enable a lot of modules of course

00:48:54,249 --> 00:48:59,410
in your insulation then you get into

00:48:56,440 --> 00:49:00,849
trouble obviously by moving contract

00:48:59,410 --> 00:49:04,390
modules to core then we can also

00:49:00,849 --> 00:49:06,609
integrate it more tightly with core like

00:49:04,390 --> 00:49:08,859
for instance especially like like

00:49:06,609 --> 00:49:10,690
language for instance you have to enable

00:49:08,859 --> 00:49:13,930
internationalization you usually have to

00:49:10,690 --> 00:49:16,239
enable at least maybe 12 to 15 modules

00:49:13,930 --> 00:49:18,099
which affect your performance in triple

00:49:16,239 --> 00:49:21,339
core eight you only need to enable three

00:49:18,099 --> 00:49:24,190
modules so in that sense we try to make

00:49:21,339 --> 00:49:26,109
sure that with a less amount of modules

00:49:24,190 --> 00:49:27,849
you can do more stuff which is great in

00:49:26,109 --> 00:49:31,180
terms of performance that we need to fix

00:49:27,849 --> 00:49:32,619
your triple is is not related to like

00:49:31,180 --> 00:49:34,870
all the side building stuff that we have

00:49:32,619 --> 00:49:37,420
done it's more really API relate

00:49:34,870 --> 00:49:39,430
it and things like bringing symphony and

00:49:37,420 --> 00:49:42,640
and things like that and using Opie Opie

00:49:39,430 --> 00:49:45,370
is always a penalty gives you a penalty

00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:48,160
in terms of performance but using it is

00:49:45,370 --> 00:49:50,110
a really good thing so yes Drupal 8

00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:52,390
might be a little bit little bit slower

00:49:50,110 --> 00:49:55,090
but in terms of scalability of Drupal 8

00:49:52,390 --> 00:49:59,370
will be fantastic so I'm looking forward

00:49:55,090 --> 00:49:59,370
to it to use in production as well so

00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:08,040
any other questions ok thank you for

00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:08,040
