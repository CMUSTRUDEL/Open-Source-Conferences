Publication date: 2013-09-26
Playlist: DrupalCon Prague - September 2013
Description: 
	We've all read the glowing success stories about how wide-eyed internet startups have built their technology platform on a foundation of good DevOps practice, but what about the rest of us? How can a large, traditional media company, 60 years in the making, apply the same tools and techniques to their existing infrastructure?

We'll discover how one such organisation introduced a DevOps capability to support the Continuous Delivery of a high traffic, multisite Drupal installation, collaborated on by several large teams, on a brand new Linux platform. In this honest, real-world account, you'll learn what we did badly as well as what we did well.
