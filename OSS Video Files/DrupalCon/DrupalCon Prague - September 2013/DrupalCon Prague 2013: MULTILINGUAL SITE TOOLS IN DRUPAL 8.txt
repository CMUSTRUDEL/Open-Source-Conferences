Title: DrupalCon Prague 2013: MULTILINGUAL SITE TOOLS IN DRUPAL 8
Publication date: 2013-09-26
Playlist: DrupalCon Prague - September 2013
Description: 
	Drupal 8 aims to provide a familiar environment yet it has many fundamental underlying changes in terms of how it understands language on your site. There are new features for single foreign language sites and multilingual sites alike.

This session will cover changes and improvements around installation, the language settings system, content language and translation support, software translation and configuration language and translation.

The ideal attendee at this session has some experience in Drupal 6 or 7 multilingual site building and want to get the scoop on what is possible in Drupal 8 core (and a key contributed module or two if needed). Those who have no experience in foreign/multilingual site building will also get a lot out of it.
