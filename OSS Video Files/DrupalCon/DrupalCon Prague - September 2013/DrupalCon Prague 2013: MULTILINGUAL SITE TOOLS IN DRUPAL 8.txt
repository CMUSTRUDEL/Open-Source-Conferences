Title: DrupalCon Prague 2013: MULTILINGUAL SITE TOOLS IN DRUPAL 8
Publication date: 2013-09-26
Playlist: DrupalCon Prague - September 2013
Description: 
	Drupal 8 aims to provide a familiar environment yet it has many fundamental underlying changes in terms of how it understands language on your site. There are new features for single foreign language sites and multilingual sites alike.

This session will cover changes and improvements around installation, the language settings system, content language and translation support, software translation and configuration language and translation.

The ideal attendee at this session has some experience in Drupal 6 or 7 multilingual site building and want to get the scoop on what is possible in Drupal 8 core (and a key contributed module or two if needed). Those who have no experience in foreign/multilingual site building will also get a lot out of it.

um so multi single is not very easy and

00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:09,750
I've experienced this a couple of times

00:00:06,779 --> 00:00:12,990
first hand that Drupal Drupal evens when

00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:17,730
I got my badges this is a badge from one

00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:19,529
of my double events this is my account

00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:22,109
site from one of the last Drupal cons

00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:25,230
this is the official program of one of

00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:29,070
the Drupal cons where I present in

00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:33,149
multilingual drew blade so so I like to

00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:35,219
think this as an analogy to where we are

00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:38,370
coming from where multilingual is an

00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:41,670
afterthought and we may get it right or

00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:43,200
we may not get it right and we want to

00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:46,289
get to a place where multilingual is a

00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,059
very integral part of our system and we

00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:50,610
support it as much as possible so this

00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:52,410
is only one of the many things that

00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:54,210
happened in Drupal 8 there's been many

00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:56,809
initiatives and non initiatives in

00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:59,370
Drupal 8 that improved the system and

00:00:56,809 --> 00:01:01,559
there's been very excellent work in

00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:04,110
services views mobile configuration

00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:06,560
management etc and I would be the first

00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:09,270
person to admit that I was freaked out

00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:11,729
there's a lot of change in Drupal 8 and

00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:13,320
I even wrote angry emails to some of the

00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:15,619
other initiative leads at the start and

00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:18,030
I got very embarrassed at the end

00:01:15,619 --> 00:01:19,890
because I thought it's going to fragment

00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:22,320
our resources is going to be very hard

00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:24,680
and and we will not achieve either of

00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:28,259
the goals that we wanted to achieve and

00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:30,750
I regretted all of that because what we

00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:33,659
ended up with is we empowered each other

00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:35,490
a lot more so you will see through this

00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:37,439
session that all the changes that the

00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:38,759
views initiative brought in all the

00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:40,740
changes that the configuration

00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:43,320
management initiative brought in a lot

00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:46,770
of those things that came from other

00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:48,780
other places really helped a lot you to

00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:50,340
make better multilingual sites there

00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:52,560
they are not the multilingual ish ative

00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:54,180
but they helped a lot for you to make

00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,610
multilingual sites and I'm presenting

00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:58,320
this session but reality is there's a

00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:00,570
lot of people who contribute to this

00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,250
initiative this is the list of all the

00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:04,860
people who are contributing to our

00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:07,039
initiative if you are in the room and

00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:10,220
you contribute can you please stand up

00:02:07,039 --> 00:02:12,450
if you comment in on these issues

00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:13,710
submitted patches you are not standing

00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:15,930
up the reason probably

00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:18,120
for that is there's a coder lunch right

00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:19,620
behind these curtains where those guys

00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:23,220
are sitting down and working on those

00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:26,190
patches so that's why if you count those

00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:29,400
people we have almost 900 people who

00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:31,380
contributed to this initiative it is not

00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:33,210
counted the same way that juries counts

00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:35,250
the thousand six hundred people in core

00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:38,040
we count everybody who commented on

00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:39,930
issues put reviews in or do any of those

00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:43,050
things who appeared on issues with

00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:45,840
comments sorry we are more liberal in

00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:47,730
how we have we count contributions we

00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,340
also had a lot of fun so we've had a lot

00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:53,870
of sprints I ran at different places we

00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:55,770
had sprints in Barcelona Berkeley Munich

00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:57,870
that's personal and again we are

00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:59,520
sprinting right here right now and as

00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:02,130
I've said behind the curtains here and

00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:03,720
we also have been sprinting the previous

00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:06,600
weekend and we will sprint and the

00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:08,520
weekend coming this week and we also

00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:10,260
obviously will spend on Friday as well

00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:12,150
so you're welcome to join us so we work

00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:17,450
very hard on this and we already

00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:20,880
resolved about 540 issues a lot of stuff

00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:23,790
so obviously we come a long way but

00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:25,980
there's a lot more to do we started off

00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:27,870
with looking at Drupal 7 and what can

00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:30,960
dribble 7 really do for you in terms of

00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:33,030
multilingual and the set state of Drupal

00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:34,860
7 multilingual is there are some things

00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:37,470
that are multilingual but it's mostly

00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:39,600
not a multilingual system so there is

00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:41,250
the low calmodulin core which can define

00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:44,820
your languages and it can try and get

00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:46,110
download track can Kendall translations

00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:48,480
that you downloaded and manually

00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:50,480
imported but that's very painful to

00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,830
manage those translations so in

00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,660
contribute a module called localization

00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:56,130
update which automates downloading those

00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:58,380
translations from the community and

00:03:56,130 --> 00:04:00,990
imports them for you and so you have

00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:02,640
less hassle if you have 100 modules and

00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:04,920
three languages if you don't have this

00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:07,680
module you need to manually download 300

00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:09,420
files to your desktop and then manually

00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,490
upload 300 files through the web

00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:14,550
interface to Drupal core and then import

00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:16,350
them it's very painful otherwise we also

00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:17,940
have content translation into plus 7

00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:21,270
which is great because it can translate

00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:23,280
nodes it cannot translate anything else

00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:26,190
so if you want to translate user

00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:27,510
profiles taxonomy terms menus views

00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:29,130
whatever else it

00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:32,850
there's no help for you in there there's

00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:35,520
nothing so Jose revier Jose ray ray hero

00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:37,890
went on and build the i-89 module suite

00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:40,650
which has a lot of modules in there and

00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:42,510
it helps you actually translate a lot of

00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:46,080
other things like menus taxonomy terms

00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:48,900
field configuration we views to some

00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:50,730
degree etc the problem there's is there

00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:53,010
is a lot of modules to do this stuff

00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:55,830
because Drupal core is not multilingual

00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:57,270
in those areas in seven so it needs to

00:04:55,830 --> 00:05:00,810
work around roopa kaur and try to

00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:03,810
provide that feature from the outside

00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:05,640
basically and also there is a generic

00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:07,380
system that you need to map every

00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:09,840
functionality to so if you have views

00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:12,210
module then you need to have i 18 n and

00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:14,070
you need to have a 18 m views module so

00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:15,930
it connects views with the 18 n or if

00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:17,310
you have web form you have web form and

00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:19,470
I teen and and then you have web form

00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:22,520
localization model that connects the two

00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:25,200
and it quickly becomes a lot of modules

00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:27,030
huge maze of modules and this will not

00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:29,250
even translate your site settings or

00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:31,560
your configuration so there is a

00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:33,210
variable module sweet that allows you to

00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:36,420
translate your site name and all of the

00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:38,460
other fun things as again on multiple

00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:41,130
multiples of modules and then you want

00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:43,560
to have an e-commerce site and you go

00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:45,240
and install Drupal commerce and you find

00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:47,640
that these 30 things that you've

00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:50,130
installed help you in no way in the

00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:51,750
process so you install the entity

00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:54,090
translation module which actually can

00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:55,830
translate the commerce entities and then

00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:57,420
it will use field translation which is

00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:59,520
very different from content translation

00:05:57,420 --> 00:06:01,080
and now you have two different solutions

00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:03,930
on your site for translating taxonomy

00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:06,210
terms so you can use energy translation

00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:07,680
i 18 n then you have two methods to

00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:10,230
translate nodes you can use content

00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:13,080
translational energy translation and it

00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:14,460
becomes a mess so it really requires a

00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,960
lot of planning to build out a

00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:18,210
multilingual site on Drupal 7 it's

00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:20,700
possible there's a very great book that

00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:22,170
you can buy Kristen Paul wrote it and I

00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:25,350
tech reviewed it so it should be very

00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:28,290
great and you can buy that and it

00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:29,820
explains all these processes but it's a

00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:31,440
lot of work in a lot of contributed

00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:34,080
modules and what we really wanted to do

00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:37,230
is to get from an afterthought to be a

00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:38,580
base thing in the system and also to

00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:41,430
have a system where you build something

00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:42,540
and its future proof for all the country

00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:45,870
and rules and all the things that you

00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:49,620
build for your site so we decided to

00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:51,390
approach this and using four pillars for

00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:52,950
areas that we wanted to work on so we

00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:55,530
wanted to have a base language system

00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:57,510
where drupal understand language in

00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:59,250
every place possible in Drupal core and

00:06:57,510 --> 00:07:00,840
it would know the language of everything

00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:03,270
in Drupal core and will not assume

00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:04,860
things that this menu may be in your

00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:06,990
site default language or maybe not

00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:09,390
that's not something we wanted to keep

00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:13,050
interplay we wanted to know data about

00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:14,160
your stuff we also wanted to improve the

00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:16,380
interface translation software

00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,910
translation capabilities bringing all

00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:19,590
the stuff that we built in can trip to

00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:22,320
help you in managing those translations

00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:24,060
and then do some more fun we wanted to

00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:26,070
have a content translation system that

00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:27,750
does not only apply to notes it applies

00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:30,510
to everything in content for your site

00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:32,220
and we wanted to have a configuration

00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:34,380
translation system that's also in core

00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:36,300
and would support you in translating any

00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:38,880
of your configuration beat views or

00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:42,090
field formats or our field settings or

00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:45,150
input formats or user roles or rules or

00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:46,740
whatever else you you want so let's look

00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:50,220
at these four pillars and see what we've

00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:51,900
done in each area and see how useful

00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:54,210
these improvements will be for you so

00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:55,860
the language pillar we wanted to make it

00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:57,660
very evident in Drupal 8 that it's a

00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:59,250
multilingual system so we moved language

00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:01,830
selection up to the first step in

00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:03,180
installer and we've included all of the

00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:05,430
languages that localize drupal org

00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:08,010
supports so you can pick any of those

00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:10,560
languages that you want and you can hit

00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:12,540
hit submit on that whatever you like we

00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,610
even pre select the language for you

00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:16,680
based in your browser preference so you

00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:18,810
don't even need to select one and then

00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:21,120
you can as you select it it downloads

00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:23,010
the translations live from the from the

00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,290
internet and then it applies it to your

00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:27,720
installer and from the second step it's

00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:29,670
all in that foreign language it supports

00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:31,770
right to left and it can download any

00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:33,360
translations from the community that's

00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:35,130
available if you don't have an internet

00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,930
connection it will try for a little

00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:38,990
while and it will say sorry I can

00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:42,900
download that please proceed in English

00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:44,460
so it's all built in there so from here

00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:46,440
on you can install in your own language

00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:48,780
there's no manual steps involved there

00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:50,340
is no install text 10-step process to

00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:52,710
download something put into place rename

00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:54,570
the file nothing you just pick the

00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:55,110
language I'm even pre-select for you

00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:57,510
from your

00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:59,190
observe your friends we also thought

00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:01,680
it's very important to extend on the

00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:03,240
language assignment capabilities so what

00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,829
I've said is Drupal core has some

00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:07,470
language capabilities it can assign

00:09:04,829 --> 00:09:09,779
language to nodes users and aliases to

00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:12,390
some degree comments as well but it does

00:09:09,779 --> 00:09:14,339
in Drupal 7 it cannot assign language to

00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:16,019
anything else so for all the other data

00:09:14,339 --> 00:09:18,360
that's in Drupal 7 Drupal needs to

00:09:16,019 --> 00:09:19,860
assume that it's in some language and in

00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:21,570
Drupal 7 in the students it's in the

00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:23,730
site default language and it's very

00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:24,779
dangerous to change the site default

00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:26,610
language on the site that you already

00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:28,769
built in Drupal 7 don't do that ever

00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:30,690
because it changes the assumptions about

00:09:28,769 --> 00:09:32,399
what language your data is in and we

00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:34,709
didn't want that pain at all in Drupal 8

00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:36,329
so what we did is we extended this to

00:09:34,709 --> 00:09:38,430
everything that we could in Drupal 8

00:09:36,329 --> 00:09:40,950
core so you can assign language to text

00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:43,380
anomie terms you can say this view is in

00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:45,450
French or check you can say your site

00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:48,000
information is in a specific language so

00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:49,980
when you install in German we save your

00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,300
site name and your slogan in German so

00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:52,920
we know that you've installed in German

00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:56,519
and this information is in German and

00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:58,769
it's independently assigned to that from

00:09:56,519 --> 00:10:00,449
any other part of the site and this is

00:09:58,769 --> 00:10:02,399
extendable to anything so we have a

00:10:00,449 --> 00:10:04,980
generic system for assigning language to

00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:06,480
content to configuration and we build

00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:09,060
this out for every piece of content and

00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:12,000
configuration that's in Drupal core so

00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:14,100
we have all that data we also have very

00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,660
flexible language UI set up for that so

00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:17,910
we have this content language settings

00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:20,310
and the admin interface and we have all

00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:23,550
the content content entity types they're

00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:26,190
like comments and users and taxonomy

00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:28,560
terms etc and then you can select which

00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:30,750
those types of content which language

00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:32,910
they will default to and if you want to

00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:34,470
show a language selector on them or if

00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:36,959
you don't want to show language selector

00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:38,730
on them so by default all of them will

00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:40,680
save in the site default language but

00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:42,360
you can configure forums to always be in

00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:44,550
English if you have a monolingual forum

00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:47,370
but your site otherwise is multilingual

00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:49,019
you can have multilingual custom blocks

00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:51,720
and you can show language selector on

00:10:49,019 --> 00:10:53,519
them etc etc so it's very easy to

00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:55,560
configure where you want to expose this

00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:57,480
selection to the user and where you want

00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:59,370
to hardwire specific languages for a

00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:00,930
specific content and you can later

00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:03,839
change your mind and change the defaults

00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:05,579
as well if you want to so we track that

00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:06,470
data and we allow you to configure that

00:11:05,579 --> 00:11:08,720
user interface

00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:10,160
on how we track the data and once we

00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,870
track that data we can do a lot of

00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:14,840
exciting things with that so we have

00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:18,350
block visibility / language which allows

00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:20,450
you to do cite cite page builds based on

00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:22,160
language conditions so show specific

00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:24,800
blocks for specific specific language

00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:27,920
pages and since we have all the language

00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:30,380
data and we have using core and we have

00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:32,270
a lot of pages converted to views even

00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:33,890
the content admin page and the user

00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:36,020
administration the user listing

00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:38,420
administration page it's very easy to

00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:40,430
customize pages for specific language

00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:41,960
needs so you can add language filters

00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:43,280
you can add language conditions on how

00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:45,320
they fall back on language selection

00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:48,440
what they display what they filter on

00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:50,810
etc so we don't need like a 18 and magic

00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:53,030
functions to do this because views and

00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:54,710
core pages are converted to views we

00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:57,170
have all the data about the languages of

00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:58,430
your things so you can use views and

00:11:57,170 --> 00:12:02,060
their conditions to build the right

00:11:58,430 --> 00:12:04,130
right pages and then you can part of

00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:05,570
your pages you can use black visibility

00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:08,210
to hide or show based on language as

00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:10,100
well so we have all the data and thanks

00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:12,440
to views we can build off of that as

00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:14,900
well we also extended a great deal on

00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:17,120
how we select languages for the page so

00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:19,190
we used to have some selections here the

00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,660
URL language selection now includes in

00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:22,910
place configuration for your path

00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:24,710
prefixes and domain so you don't need to

00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:26,750
go to another place you have an overview

00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:29,420
of all the settings which is pretty cool

00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:31,340
we have sessions selection as before we

00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:32,750
have account preference as before we

00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:34,610
have browser preference and now we

00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:36,410
understand that there is language codes

00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:38,720
outside of Drupal that are not the same

00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:40,220
as inside Drupal so you can add mappings

00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,990
of outside language codes to inside

00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:44,210
language codes so we can detect

00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:46,630
languages based on that as well we have

00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:49,580
a count preference for admin pages as

00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:51,650
separately and we have a configurable

00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:53,330
language fall back so you don't need to

00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:55,700
change the site default language to

00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:57,800
change what language your site selection

00:12:55,700 --> 00:13:01,550
will fall back on which is again

00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:03,740
improving a lot in in what language will

00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:06,410
the page be handled with so we improved

00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:08,780
the URL configuration a great deal we

00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:10,430
improved browser detection by supporting

00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:13,190
language mappings from outside language

00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:14,900
goes to inside language codes and we

00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:17,510
added an account preference for admin

00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:19,610
pages which is very useful if you don't

00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:20,250
want if you have a multilingual site but

00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:22,800
you only know

00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:24,780
like 22 of those languages and you still

00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:27,030
want to delete spam from the Chinese

00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:28,710
pages then those pages when you go to

00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:30,840
them when you administer them it will

00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:32,850
not be Chinese there you will get their

00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:34,980
language for your own a preference and

00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:36,330
then we have selected language instead

00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,830
of default language so you can configure

00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:40,320
the fallback language on the side as

00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:42,390
well we also built in the name

00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,400
transliteration and we applied it to

00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:45,990
content types in course of course if you

00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:48,420
add an English content type name it

00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:50,550
works but then if you add something else

00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:52,530
like in this case the Hungarian word

00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:55,470
that that contains all the accents in

00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:58,350
hang in Hungarian then it will translate

00:13:55,470 --> 00:14:00,210
it to a meaningful English word and this

00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:02,010
all this also works for basically any

00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:04,950
other language so it works for our

00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:07,320
Russian it works for check all kinds of

00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:10,350
other things that we have built in so we

00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:12,690
only apply this to to matching names at

00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:14,370
this point it is possible to build

00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:16,290
contributed modules to apply this to

00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:18,300
file uploads we're going to get any

00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:19,890
other thing but we have the base system

00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:21,840
in core and we applied it to machine

00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:24,600
names already it would be great to

00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:26,640
extend core to support it for files it's

00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:29,220
not a very easy dust dust to do but it

00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:31,770
would be a lot of fun and one more thing

00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:35,700
that that Europeans would really love i

00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:38,190
think is English can be deleted now so

00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:39,510
there's no need to keep around English

00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:41,970
on your site if you're never going to

00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:43,589
use English in fact if you install in a

00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:45,030
different language like Arabic that I

00:14:43,589 --> 00:14:47,610
installed at the start there is no

00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:50,610
English edit to the system so everything

00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:52,650
will be understood as Arabic and there's

00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:54,000
no like magic English showing up in

00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:56,370
different language selectors if you

00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:00,030
don't want to have that it's easy to add

00:14:56,370 --> 00:15:01,860
it back if you want it so this these are

00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:04,860
these are a lot of improvements and this

00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:08,310
is only one-fourth of our initiative one

00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:11,220
fourth so you is the base language layer

00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:12,810
you can delete English we have a very

00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:15,600
flexible language selection system

00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:18,180
detection and selection system now we

00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:20,520
have black visibility / language uses in

00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:21,839
core and we have all the data and you

00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:24,480
can build views out of language

00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:26,250
conditions we have flexible

00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,709
configuration for language selectors and

00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:30,300
language defaults and entities we have

00:15:28,709 --> 00:15:32,310
much of either assignment for language

00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:34,050
so we know much more about your data and

00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:36,089
language relations and

00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:37,290
we are first in the Installer so if you

00:15:36,089 --> 00:15:39,450
don't recognize that Drupal is

00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:42,240
multilingual that we can't go anywhere

00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:45,180
better than this so that was the first

00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:47,850
of four areas second area interface

00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:51,779
translation this is what used to be the

00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:54,300
main function of of locale module if you

00:15:51,779 --> 00:16:03,750
want to take yeah sure let's do a

00:15:54,300 --> 00:16:05,279
question yeah so the question is what

00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:08,339
happens if i delete english and there is

00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:10,019
no translation reality is drupal's the

00:16:08,339 --> 00:16:12,120
software is still written in english so

00:16:10,019 --> 00:16:14,160
the text is already in the code so we

00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:15,720
can take that text on display that even

00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,640
if you don't have English configured

00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:20,010
because the text comes from the code

00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:21,450
anyway all the things that you create on

00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:22,800
your site you will create in your own

00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:23,850
language because you don't want English

00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,440
so you will create it in your own

00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:26,880
language so that's available in your

00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,130
language and all the stuff that comes

00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:32,250
from code will be in English if you

00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:34,769
don't translate them so it works it

00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:37,980
works the same way T function works the

00:16:34,769 --> 00:16:40,290
same way as before so interface

00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:41,910
translation is our second pillar and we

00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:43,860
built in the automated downloads that

00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:46,620
that we have in localization update

00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:48,300
except it's much cooler now because it's

00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:51,060
also built into the Installer right away

00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:52,500
as you have seen so it's it identifies

00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:54,240
all the versions of your project in

00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:55,529
automatically downloads translations for

00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,870
every module that you have in every

00:16:55,529 --> 00:16:59,940
theme and its future proof it works for

00:16:57,870 --> 00:17:01,440
every distribution works with every

00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:04,709
module that's on Drupal or organ has

00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:06,750
this information so I think it's way

00:17:04,709 --> 00:17:08,160
easier we also centralized the

00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:10,709
translation file location to one

00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:12,720
directory and why why is that important

00:17:10,709 --> 00:17:15,689
it's important because it allows you to

00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:17,459
have deployments with translations so

00:17:15,689 --> 00:17:20,250
you can have the automated downloads on

00:17:17,459 --> 00:17:22,140
the staging or the dev site and then you

00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:23,730
can turn off the automatic downloads on

00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:25,679
the live site because you don't want

00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:27,360
your life site to magically have new

00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:29,280
translations every day there will be

00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:31,260
kind of confusing so you can have it on

00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:33,540
devon stage you can do the quality

00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:35,640
assurance and then because it's only one

00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:37,980
directory it can it can actually be put

00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:39,360
in to get if you want so you can version

00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:42,000
control you can see dips of what

00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:44,010
translations changed in interface it's

00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,500
very cool and then you can push that to

00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:46,800
life and with the single drache command

00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,180
you

00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:50,700
import all the all the translations

00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:54,180
there and you are ready to go with your

00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:57,690
q8 translation update so I think it's

00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:59,730
it's very powerful we've also put in

00:17:57,690 --> 00:18:02,220
customization tracking so how many of

00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:04,790
you are not entirely happy with the

00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:07,980
translations in your language for drupal

00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:09,690
some of you owe a lot of you program so

00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:11,850
one option is you go and help pod to

00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:14,280
translation team okay that's the best

00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:16,260
option but the translation team will not

00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:18,180
always like your suggestions right you

00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:19,620
want to have special text for an

00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:21,120
audience you are building a site for

00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:23,430
teenagers are you building a site for

00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:26,130
serious corporate types you need to have

00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:27,960
different wording so what we have in

00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:29,790
Drupal 8 we track customizations that

00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:32,280
are different from the community

00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:33,720
translations so you can customize those

00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:35,520
drinks and we will protect those

00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:36,960
translations from being overwritten from

00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,700
the community or all those

00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,590
customizations will be kept for you and

00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:42,960
you can export them and use them in

00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:45,150
another project and we use them as you

00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,680
want so I think that's also very

00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:49,800
powerful and we worked a lot on

00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:51,600
supporting small sites so the import

00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:53,580
importing of pio files even though we

00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:56,130
import huge Bo files and Drupal 8 is

00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:57,720
much bigger than Drupal 7 the import

00:18:56,130 --> 00:19:01,110
happens in a process that it will never

00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:03,870
time out your PHP process we also have a

00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:06,390
whole new interface for for translating

00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:08,220
on the site it's a table of source text

00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:10,980
and target text and it's for one

00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:13,080
specific language in Drupal 7 you

00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:15,420
translate for all of them at once which

00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:18,060
is not very likely applicable to you and

00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:19,860
it supports plural strings that supports

00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:21,870
any number of plurals unlike the triple

00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:23,400
7 built and user interface so you've

00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:25,050
probably never seen the version of this

00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:28,230
interface in Drupal 7 because it's

00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:30,060
useless it can be used so we have a very

00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:32,100
nice user interface for this in eighth

00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:33,600
and now since you customize these

00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:35,400
strings in the translations you can

00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:37,380
filter for only translated strings and

00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:39,000
only customized translations and are

00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:42,300
these are more customized translations

00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:45,390
so it's very easy to translate and and

00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:48,390
review what you did and just move over

00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:49,830
with these tasks another good thing that

00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:53,850
we did to English is now you can

00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:55,410
translate to English so if you go so by

00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:56,880
default and the translation is not

00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:58,710
applicable to English but if you edit

00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,630
English there's a checkbox to enable

00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:02,370
translation to English

00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:04,620
and then you save that and then now you

00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:06,720
can translate to English which means

00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:08,220
that you can replace English text with a

00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,770
different English tag so if you want to

00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:12,750
replace login with sign in then you can

00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:14,610
search for login you can replace that

00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:17,700
with signing you can save this

00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:19,860
translation and it will be available on

00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:22,230
your front end on the login form so

00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:24,570
there the button that was used to say

00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:27,030
login now says sign in so you don't need

00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:28,620
to add my custom English whatever that

00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:32,430
you needed to have in seven it's very

00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:34,890
painful it it breaks your storage for

00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:37,050
English content etc you just translation

00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:38,970
enable English the reason we don't have

00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:41,190
this by default is because it will slow

00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:43,110
down your English pages because this is

00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:46,110
extra database queries and things like

00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:47,910
that so you need to accept this if you

00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:49,950
want to have this feature so this is

00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:51,450
only the second pillar of the Drupal 8

00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:54,500
multan improvements we still have two

00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:56,700
pillars so you can translate to English

00:20:54,500 --> 00:21:00,360
there's a whole new interface for

00:20:56,700 --> 00:21:02,070
insight translations we track your

00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:04,110
customizations and we protect them from

00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:06,900
being overwritten from the community we

00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:08,460
centralized the translations into one

00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:10,710
directory so it's very deployment

00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:12,690
friendly and you can push from staging

00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:14,760
deaf to live and you can turn off the

00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:15,990
automation on the life but otherwise we

00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:17,790
can automatically download your

00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:19,320
translations and this is separate

00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:21,450
modules so if you only want to track

00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:22,890
language on your stuff if you have a

00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:24,930
search engine and you want and you have

00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:26,580
data and you just want to track language

00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:30,450
you don't need to enable this module and

00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:32,340
your site will be actually faster so the

00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:33,990
third pillar that we have is content

00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:37,290
translation and what I said is the

00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:39,690
problem in Drupal 7 is content only

00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:41,850
really applies to nodes so we wanted to

00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:44,220
solve this in Drupal 8 and our goal is

00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:46,110
to support all content entities in

00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:50,070
Drupal core what does that mean so what

00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:51,920
are content entities in duple core so

00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:55,680
first of all there are entities which

00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:57,420
store itemized things and some of the

00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:59,970
entities are content entities this is

00:21:57,420 --> 00:22:02,370
not a hundred percent to graph but it's

00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:04,560
a good generalization for our session so

00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:06,810
the content entities are like nodes

00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:10,440
users comments terms contact messages

00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:12,570
menu items etc etc mostly the things

00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:14,080
that you can put fields on not all of

00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:17,230
them are feel double but

00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:19,000
of them are feel double so we made it so

00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:21,279
that each of these can store their own

00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,590
language and we also made it so that

00:22:21,279 --> 00:22:25,899
each of these can have their fields

00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:28,630
translated so whatever fields you can

00:22:25,899 --> 00:22:32,740
put on users for profiles or put on

00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:35,440
taxonomy terms or even comments will be

00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:38,529
translatable and we have a very flexible

00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:39,940
configuration interface for this so it's

00:22:38,529 --> 00:22:41,529
the same UI that you've seen for

00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:43,120
language set up but if you enable the

00:22:41,529 --> 00:22:44,799
content translation module it will have

00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:46,929
a check box on the side you can mark

00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:50,260
something translatable the article

00:22:46,929 --> 00:22:52,059
content type for example and now it can

00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:54,490
you can configure per field so it has a

00:22:52,059 --> 00:22:57,190
body field an image field and the image

00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:59,440
field has a file and i'll text a title

00:22:57,190 --> 00:23:01,480
and it has a tags field so the image

00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:03,610
field even has sub field components that

00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:05,620
you can configure and you can share the

00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:07,360
file between different translations but

00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:11,409
you can translate the alt text than the

00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:13,840
label etc so it's very powerful and

00:23:11,409 --> 00:23:15,820
there's a lot of a lot of granularity in

00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:17,860
how you can configure this so if you

00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:19,630
want to have an e-commerce site and you

00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:21,370
don't want to translate your product

00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:23,529
prices why would you want to translate

00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:25,779
your product prices then you will never

00:23:23,529 --> 00:23:27,909
enable translation for that field and it

00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:31,299
will be same across everything then you

00:23:27,909 --> 00:23:33,100
can like enable the product image

00:23:31,299 --> 00:23:35,500
translation but don't enable for the

00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:37,389
product image itself you can enable for

00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:39,309
the label on it and the alt text and

00:23:37,389 --> 00:23:40,779
then you can translate those and the

00:23:39,309 --> 00:23:43,450
image itself will be the same across

00:23:40,779 --> 00:23:45,250
languages so it's very powerful and it

00:23:43,450 --> 00:23:47,440
applies to every content in Drupal core

00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:49,480
and it applies to every entity content

00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:53,230
entity in Drupal contribs going to be

00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:55,659
built so it's very very granular and

00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:57,399
it's very future proof in terms of the

00:23:55,659 --> 00:23:59,350
translation interface there is not much

00:23:57,399 --> 00:24:01,149
of a news here for you because it's

00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:03,519
basically very similar to what we've had

00:24:01,149 --> 00:24:05,500
in Drupal 7 you have a translate tab you

00:24:03,519 --> 00:24:07,570
go there it's a list of languages and

00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:09,730
then you can add a translation and then

00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:11,169
you get the note form at the new note

00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:13,149
form into plate and then you add that

00:24:11,169 --> 00:24:17,139
translation and then it will be

00:24:13,149 --> 00:24:19,029
available for you so for the user at the

00:24:17,139 --> 00:24:22,750
end it's a very similar you I but the

00:24:19,029 --> 00:24:25,330
internals are entirely different so the

00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:26,900
module name is the same but there is no

00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:29,300
there is no common

00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:31,340
thing between the two modules this will

00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:33,110
translate every entity and it will

00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:35,360
started translations in the fields and

00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:37,430
it will have a very similar user

00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:42,080
interface but it internally works very

00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:44,540
different so so we correct the problem

00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:46,280
of supporting all entities but Drupal 8

00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:47,540
is not yet done so Drupal 8 there is no

00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:49,640
Drupal 8 point know that you can

00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:52,010
download right now so it's not probably

00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:54,920
not yet done so we are still working on

00:24:52,010 --> 00:24:56,600
a property translate ability for example

00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:59,300
obviously would be very useful for you

00:24:56,600 --> 00:25:01,850
to translate note titles right it's kind

00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:03,980
of useful um we don't have that right

00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:05,480
now on the user interface so if you go

00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:07,460
there you try to edit it you will file a

00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:09,440
bug report that you can translate it yes

00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:11,210
you cannot at the moment we are working

00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:14,270
on that one and we are working on

00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:16,280
solutions for menus and taxonomy terms

00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:18,590
we may not have a course solution for

00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:20,330
those two to have properties but any

00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:22,100
fields you put on them are translatable

00:25:20,330 --> 00:25:23,870
we strive to have a solution for

00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:26,450
properties we may not be able to get

00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:28,100
there the other bad news for you is the

00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:30,560
aggregate path will be a country module

00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:32,390
there's a lot involved in this migration

00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:34,910
process because we need to take your old

00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:36,710
nodes and merge them together and put

00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:39,650
them into one node and then do path

00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:41,690
redirects and all kinds of fun things so

00:25:39,650 --> 00:25:44,410
this will probably not be a fitting

00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:47,630
solution for core so we'll build it in

00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:49,880
contribute to have be very creative

00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:51,440
about how we migrate I 89 and entity

00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:53,570
translation stuff to this new system

00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:55,250
because we bring in all the good stuff

00:25:53,570 --> 00:25:56,720
from my 18 and an entity translation

00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:59,180
into one system and we need to migrate

00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:01,850
all your data however there are a lot of

00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:03,920
other good news in this area the core

00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:06,860
search api's we updated to support this

00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:08,810
system so if you use core search then

00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:11,120
all of those things will be indexed as

00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:12,920
separate things in the search and search

00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:15,860
api passes on all the language

00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:17,840
information for any other module so if

00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:19,010
you use apache solr apache solr module

00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:22,100
will get all the language information

00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:23,570
that we have and then it's up to apache

00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:27,470
solr module and it does with that

00:26:23,570 --> 00:26:29,420
information what's especially funky is

00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:31,220
not access API supports language so you

00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:33,230
can have separate access / language

00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:35,120
which may be very interesting like if

00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:36,740
you are selling selling access to

00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:39,050
content that you can sell access to

00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:40,100
German but separate sign up for French

00:26:39,050 --> 00:26:45,440
or something

00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:48,530
as possible so in summary this is the

00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:54,080
third pillar of Drupal core we have no

00:26:48,530 --> 00:26:55,700
tax s API supported which is great if

00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:58,070
you want to have granule access or

00:26:55,700 --> 00:27:00,559
selling stuff based on language we have

00:26:58,070 --> 00:27:03,500
search index indexing a separate things

00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:06,620
for these translations Search API is no

00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:07,910
all this data it applies to all content

00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:10,429
enemies its future proof its

00:27:07,910 --> 00:27:12,590
distribution proof it applies per bundle

00:27:10,429 --> 00:27:14,900
entity bundle and then the field level

00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:16,940
and the sub field level like you've seen

00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:18,710
for image fields you can make part of

00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:20,960
the image field translatable the

00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:22,850
property translations we are working on

00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:24,980
we may not have all of them ready by

00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:27,169
drupal 8 release but we would love to

00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:29,419
have them ready and the upgrade path

00:27:27,169 --> 00:27:32,360
will be in contributes not yet ready at

00:27:29,419 --> 00:27:34,820
all the fourth pillar is configuration

00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:36,289
translation and this is an area where we

00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:38,510
are really thankful for the

00:27:36,289 --> 00:27:40,640
configuration initiative because they

00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:43,820
did an awesome job of applying a new

00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:48,530
system to at every configuration part of

00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:51,049
Drupal 8 core so I've shown this thing

00:27:48,530 --> 00:27:53,510
before about entities having content

00:27:51,049 --> 00:27:56,270
entities and all these things and there

00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:58,130
is also generate configuration system so

00:27:56,270 --> 00:28:00,110
there's a generic content entity system

00:27:58,130 --> 00:28:02,480
and there's a generate configuration

00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:03,980
system which is very good for the

00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,900
multilingual initiative because we can

00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:07,970
build generic solutions for content and

00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:09,620
configuration and all the things we

00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:11,659
built for configuration will apply to

00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:14,620
views vocabularies contact categories

00:28:11,659 --> 00:28:16,900
menus fields input formats user roles

00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:19,490
whatever else is on the system basically

00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:22,580
entity display modes entity four modes

00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:24,620
etc etc so we have we have a generic

00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:26,299
solution for that as well and it applies

00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:29,110
to configuration entities and

00:28:26,299 --> 00:28:31,429
configuration instances or configure a

00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:34,549
standalone configuration as well in

00:28:31,429 --> 00:28:38,150
general now if you build something for

00:28:34,549 --> 00:28:41,600
Drupal and you are not in the green

00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:46,780
circle or the blue circle and you want

00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:49,750
to have multilingual you are on your own

00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:52,530
you we don't have any solutions for you

00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:54,870
so in core

00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:57,540
we do have path uses that I have a

00:28:54,870 --> 00:29:00,180
one-off implementation of language it's

00:28:57,540 --> 00:29:02,430
neither content neither config but if

00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:05,280
you want if you do something with Drupal

00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:08,610
8 and and you are not a Content entity

00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:11,730
or configuration of some kind then you

00:29:08,610 --> 00:29:13,500
are on your own so embrace these api's

00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:15,720
it's a very is going to be very good for

00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:17,960
you because configuration entities have

00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:20,730
a lot of developer experience back end

00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:22,260
they automatically store your data they

00:29:20,730 --> 00:29:25,110
have lists controllers their form

00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:26,850
controllers they have dragon droppable

00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:28,260
forum controllers that you can just like

00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:30,210
write a few lines of code and you get a

00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:33,120
drag and drop list controller that you

00:29:30,210 --> 00:29:34,980
can do content has view support all

00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:37,890
around so there's a lot of power behind

00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:40,470
these two systems so you should adopt

00:29:37,890 --> 00:29:43,170
these two systems and work off of them

00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:45,120
because they are amazing so what we do

00:29:43,170 --> 00:29:47,250
for our configuration is we track again

00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:49,530
language on each configuration file so

00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:51,450
you can't create a view only in French

00:29:49,530 --> 00:29:53,460
and you can create a view only in

00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:55,380
Flemish or Dutch or whatever you want

00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:57,060
and then you can translate it from there

00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:59,570
to other languages and have all that fun

00:29:57,060 --> 00:30:02,280
stuff so this is useful if you have

00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:04,230
local community areas in your site and

00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:06,480
you need to do something for that area

00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:08,100
but you don't you don't want to do it as

00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:10,100
a general solution you can do a one-off

00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:13,680
French view for that area or one of

00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:15,750
German view for the other area all the

00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:18,390
language overrides for configuration of

00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:21,030
the language for configuration is stored

00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:22,890
in the configuration system so it's

00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:24,660
again very deployment friendly it

00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:27,840
deploys with your configuration to the

00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:29,510
one side to another so it's very very

00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:32,430
well integrated with how the

00:30:29,510 --> 00:30:34,080
configuration process works we have a UI

00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:36,960
in court to translate shipped

00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:39,390
configuration like this contact category

00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:41,130
that's called website feedback you can

00:30:39,390 --> 00:30:42,990
go to the translation you write that

00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:45,870
I've shown you a few slides earlier and

00:30:42,990 --> 00:30:47,700
look for look for that so let here I

00:30:45,870 --> 00:30:49,650
enable language switcher so that I can

00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:52,170
actually show you that it works because

00:30:49,650 --> 00:30:53,940
otherwise I could just like heck you or

00:30:52,170 --> 00:30:56,010
else but it's not very visible for you

00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:58,200
so I enable a language switcher and I

00:30:56,010 --> 00:31:01,050
have English and Hungarian because I

00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:02,850
know Hungarian best my mother tongue so

00:31:01,050 --> 00:31:04,020
I switched to Hungarian nothing changes

00:31:02,850 --> 00:31:05,850
because i don't have hungarian

00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:07,770
translation for this I can

00:31:05,850 --> 00:31:10,049
go to the translation user interface and

00:31:07,770 --> 00:31:11,820
just take that website feedback string

00:31:10,049 --> 00:31:13,950
search for that and translated to

00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:15,660
Hungarian right there and because this

00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:18,600
is part of the software it's been

00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:20,760
shipped with Drupal core it is included

00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:23,039
in the software translation you why so I

00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:25,080
can translate it I can save it and from

00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:27,510
here on its saved back to the

00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:30,450
configuration system and voila it's in

00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:32,640
Hungarian so anything that ships with

00:31:30,450 --> 00:31:36,390
Drupal core you can translate using this

00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:38,669
built-in user interface in core the

00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:40,020
little caveat here is we are still

00:31:38,669 --> 00:31:41,940
working on localized Drupal are our

00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:44,010
integration so there's going to be

00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:45,900
modules distributions themes that ship

00:31:44,010 --> 00:31:48,630
with fields and entity display modes and

00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:50,280
all kinds of configuration and we want

00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:51,750
to get all the text from them and make

00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:54,150
it available for the community to

00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:55,679
translate for you so when you download

00:31:54,150 --> 00:31:56,789
Drupal all the views and content types

00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:59,429
and fields and everything will be

00:31:56,789 --> 00:32:01,679
translated from the community we don't

00:31:59,429 --> 00:32:03,450
have all that integration done yet this

00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:05,309
is again not an easy problem and we need

00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:07,169
more hands to help with that but we will

00:32:05,309 --> 00:32:08,850
we should be able to do that because

00:32:07,169 --> 00:32:10,440
otherwise Drupal 8 is kind of not

00:32:08,850 --> 00:32:13,440
fulfilling its promise of being fully

00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:15,900
multilingual this is for built-in

00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:18,000
configuration you you also going to

00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:20,340
build a lot of your own configuration so

00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,470
we built a module that's applicable to

00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:24,600
any configuration built-in or otherwise

00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:26,100
and it's called a configuration

00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:28,650
translation module and we are proposing

00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:31,169
this fork or so you can for example

00:32:28,650 --> 00:32:33,870
translate your block with this so I go

00:32:31,169 --> 00:32:36,299
to edit my block I want to translate the

00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:37,950
block label to Hungarian I translate it

00:32:36,299 --> 00:32:41,130
to Hungarian I tap in the Hungarian

00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:44,400
title I save that and then that's

00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:46,740
available in Hungarian I can do the same

00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:49,350
for my site name and my slogan I have my

00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:50,940
fantastic site I go to the site

00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:52,830
information screen oh there's a

00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:55,380
translate tab who would have thought I

00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:57,390
can translate the site name in my slogan

00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:59,880
I can add a Hungarian translation typing

00:32:57,390 --> 00:33:02,520
my site name translation typing my

00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:05,610
slogan translation will be safe to the

00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:09,409
configuration system if I come back to

00:33:05,610 --> 00:33:11,909
this screen it will come back at me and

00:33:09,409 --> 00:33:14,280
it's available so if i switch to

00:33:11,909 --> 00:33:16,320
Hungarian my fantastic site changes to

00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:19,610
fantastic double dog which is Hungarian

00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:23,310
and my blog title will change and my

00:33:19,610 --> 00:33:25,650
config label changed etc and this

00:33:23,310 --> 00:33:27,950
applies to configuration in Drupal core

00:33:25,650 --> 00:33:32,850
like user role names input formats views

00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:35,040
fields content types whatever so this is

00:33:32,850 --> 00:33:37,680
a generic user interface that puts

00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:40,260
translate tabs on all the things that

00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:41,880
are configuration so you go and and

00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:43,740
there's even contextual links so you go

00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:45,540
in a block you can configure block

00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:48,540
translate block you're going to view

00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:50,250
edit view translate view so you can go

00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:51,930
in and translate stuff as you go and

00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:53,670
this is a fully built module it's

00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:55,920
available right now for Drupal core you

00:33:53,670 --> 00:33:57,870
can try it out it works and we hope to

00:33:55,920 --> 00:34:01,350
have it committed to Drupal core in a

00:33:57,870 --> 00:34:04,170
couple of weeks it's not this week it's

00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:06,540
a feature and we are man months after

00:34:04,170 --> 00:34:08,760
feature fees but we are still arguing

00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:10,020
for this it we found a lot of core bugs

00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:12,120
while we've been building this out

00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:14,220
because this cross is a lot of course

00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:18,510
systems from configuration language

00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:21,300
routing views and all kinds of areas we

00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:24,870
are using in this that that it's a very

00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:26,700
powerful thing that that not only good

00:34:24,870 --> 00:34:30,360
for user experience but also very good

00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:31,830
for developers so the configuration

00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:33,510
error here we wanted to have a solution

00:34:31,830 --> 00:34:35,820
that's future-proof and it works for

00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:38,159
everyone so we built a full translation

00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:40,260
module that applies to all the content

00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:42,030
all the configuration all the config

00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:45,600
enemies all the normal configuration on

00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:47,520
your site we really worked very hard to

00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:51,000
make the developer experience of this as

00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:53,820
simple as possible so it's very easy to

00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:55,320
build with this there's very minimal

00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:57,900
stuff that you need to do to integrate

00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:59,610
with this module we have standard

00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:02,540
translation tabs here that are you know

00:34:59,610 --> 00:35:05,460
from content translation is the same

00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:07,380
same UI basically we work with config

00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:09,360
overrides in the configuration system so

00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:11,580
its deployment friendly it works for

00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:13,640
anything in configuration we have a core

00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:16,260
user interface for shipped configuration

00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:19,470
so that's all the things that I think

00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:21,240
are good about Drupal 8 multilingual

00:35:19,470 --> 00:35:22,860
improvements so we have a layer

00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:24,420
basically or for language we know

00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:26,610
language of almost everything you have

00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:28,110
in Drupal core and we have much better

00:35:26,610 --> 00:35:30,660
language assignment and language

00:35:28,110 --> 00:35:32,460
detection capabilities we have a

00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:32,770
software translation system that has a

00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:34,780
mud

00:35:32,770 --> 00:35:36,670
better user interface it automatically

00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:39,550
downloads from the community it tracks

00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:42,070
your customizations now it has a lot of

00:35:39,550 --> 00:35:43,810
fine UI improvements we have a content

00:35:42,070 --> 00:35:46,420
translation system that applies to every

00:35:43,810 --> 00:35:48,880
content entity it works off of fields it

00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:51,700
has you it allows you to configure sub

00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:53,530
field level translations and it's very

00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:55,270
powerful for that and it integrates with

00:35:53,530 --> 00:35:56,890
views as well and we have a

00:35:55,270 --> 00:35:57,970
configuration translation system that

00:35:56,890 --> 00:35:59,770
applies to everything in the

00:35:57,970 --> 00:36:02,710
configuration system even your

00:35:59,770 --> 00:36:04,150
contributed modules and it has a has as

00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:05,950
integration with the software

00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:08,200
translation system so we can provide you

00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:09,490
with default translations for views and

00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:11,650
kinds of types and everything that ships

00:36:09,490 --> 00:36:13,000
with core and we have a user interface

00:36:11,650 --> 00:36:17,170
for you to translate any configuration

00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:25,590
on your site so that's what's in Drupal

00:36:17,170 --> 00:36:25,590
8 core but but there is one more thing

00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:30,610
that's not in Drupal 8 core so if

00:36:29,050 --> 00:36:32,140
anybody like seriously looked at these

00:36:30,610 --> 00:36:34,950
lights there's four pillars and there's

00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:37,330
I could also have set forth silos

00:36:34,950 --> 00:36:39,430
because there are different systems with

00:36:37,330 --> 00:36:42,340
different solutions they try to have a

00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:44,020
very similar user interface which is by

00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:46,870
the way also accessible we worked on

00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:48,880
that as well but there are three silos

00:36:46,870 --> 00:36:50,410
so there's a silo for software

00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:52,390
translation there's a silo for content

00:36:50,410 --> 00:36:53,890
then there's a silo for configuration

00:36:52,390 --> 00:36:56,800
and they are very different systems

00:36:53,890 --> 00:36:58,360
inside so those are silos so if you want

00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:00,430
to really like control your site

00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:02,620
translations you need to have a system

00:37:00,430 --> 00:37:04,570
on top of this and it sits on top it

00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:08,440
swoops in order all the stuff or the

00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:10,060
content and it pushes it outward so

00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:13,150
there's two possible solutions for that

00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:15,790
one is the T MGMT module that's already

00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:18,910
being ported to Drupal 8 this is a

00:37:15,790 --> 00:37:20,890
Drupal 8 p.m. gmt screenshot that can

00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:23,380
take your stuff from these content

00:37:20,890 --> 00:37:25,420
entities from software translation and

00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:27,670
eventually from config translations it's

00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:29,110
not yet built but it's coming and it can

00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:32,200
integrate with outside translation

00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:34,090
providers etc so this is a layer on top

00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:36,550
of what's available in Drupal core and

00:37:34,090 --> 00:37:38,620
it integrates all of these silos into

00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:40,480
one system and can integrate with

00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:43,510
third-parties there's a session about

00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:44,349
this on Thursday 1pm to 2pm in the

00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:47,349
amazing labs

00:37:44,349 --> 00:37:49,720
and there's another solution from the

00:37:47,349 --> 00:37:51,640
lingotek guys who are sponsors of this

00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:54,700
conference and you can talk to them at

00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:58,049
the exhibition area and they have above

00:37:54,700 --> 00:38:02,289
about their solution on thursday from

00:37:58,049 --> 00:38:05,380
1045 to 1145 where they show their

00:38:02,289 --> 00:38:07,989
integrated solution for this that sits

00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:09,430
on top of of all these systems i believe

00:38:07,989 --> 00:38:11,249
they don't have that party to do play

00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:14,309
yet but they will have it eventually

00:38:11,249 --> 00:38:18,700
they have a drupal 7 version right now

00:38:14,309 --> 00:38:20,410
so there is a lot of stuff and we as

00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:21,910
you've seen we still have a lot to do so

00:38:20,410 --> 00:38:24,729
if you want to get involved there's a

00:38:21,910 --> 00:38:26,229
sprint friday this week there is a

00:38:24,729 --> 00:38:28,779
mentoring sprint for those who have not

00:38:26,229 --> 00:38:30,220
been involved so far and there's a

00:38:28,779 --> 00:38:33,130
multilingual sprint for those who have

00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:34,479
been involved or feel confident to join

00:38:33,130 --> 00:38:35,769
the team right away if you don't feel

00:38:34,479 --> 00:38:37,660
confident to join the team right away

00:38:35,769 --> 00:38:39,130
there is a mentoring sprint they will

00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:41,559
let you get started and in the afternoon

00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:43,690
you can come over and work with us but

00:38:41,559 --> 00:38:47,049
if you just feel like coming over with

00:38:43,690 --> 00:38:49,150
us then also fine we also have a lot of

00:38:47,049 --> 00:38:51,999
other ways to get involved we have a

00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:54,400
website at Drupal 8 multilingual org if

00:38:51,999 --> 00:38:56,380
you want to translate Drupal 8 that's

00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:58,809
already available in localized do blood

00:38:56,380 --> 00:39:01,690
work for translation we have a twitter

00:38:58,809 --> 00:39:03,940
feed we have a sprint in prague that ice

00:39:01,690 --> 00:39:08,680
I've said we started last Saturday and

00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:11,950
we are here until sunday late Sunday I

00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:14,499
think 2 a.m. on Monday actually all

00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:16,960
right we have a sprint page spin space

00:39:14,499 --> 00:39:18,400
booked and there's a sprinting viana

00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:20,289
coming up and there is more Sprint's

00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:23,440
coming we will sprint inside a drupal

00:39:20,289 --> 00:39:25,660
that day's march as well if you want to

00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:27,849
have your hands on all of this as I've

00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:29,440
said this already already works and you

00:39:27,849 --> 00:39:32,229
can try it out the configuration

00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:33,789
translation stuff is not in court yet so

00:39:32,229 --> 00:39:36,160
that's a module that we maintain as a

00:39:33,789 --> 00:39:38,049
contributed module at the moment you go

00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:40,210
there configuration translation module

00:39:38,049 --> 00:39:42,160
it has a nice green button try it with

00:39:40,210 --> 00:39:43,989
Drupal 8 you hit that button you get a

00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:45,339
simply test me site with Drupal 8 and

00:39:43,989 --> 00:39:46,839
this module and it has all the things

00:39:45,339 --> 00:39:50,319
that I talked about working and you can

00:39:46,839 --> 00:39:52,119
try it out and once again i'm here to

00:39:50,319 --> 00:39:56,469
talk about this but this is a work of

00:39:52,119 --> 00:39:57,240
almost 900 people 500 issues most of

00:39:56,469 --> 00:39:58,740
whom are

00:39:57,240 --> 00:40:00,480
or not most from a lot of them are

00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:02,400
actually behind these curtains and

00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:04,590
working on this right now so more of

00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:06,690
these things get fixed in core and and

00:40:04,590 --> 00:40:09,750
it will be even better for you at the

00:40:06,690 --> 00:40:23,369
end so with that I'm open for questions

00:40:09,750 --> 00:40:25,080
and discussions any questions so if you

00:40:23,369 --> 00:40:27,390
have questions there's a mic right there

00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:29,850
it's easiest to if you like line up

00:40:27,390 --> 00:40:31,770
behind the mic or if you don't want to

00:40:29,850 --> 00:40:34,400
line up I will try to hear you and

00:40:31,770 --> 00:40:34,400
repeat your question

00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:46,100
so the question is if is it possible to

00:40:43,790 --> 00:40:48,140
install one general language in

00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:52,430
different variants like us English our

00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:54,550
UK English the answer is as yes so there

00:40:52,430 --> 00:40:57,880
is a UK English on localized drupal org

00:40:54,550 --> 00:41:00,770
they are not very active in in in

00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:05,450
replacing in US english text with you

00:41:00,770 --> 00:41:07,430
can english but it is possible yes there

00:41:05,450 --> 00:41:09,020
is a more complex use case they're like

00:41:07,430 --> 00:41:11,780
if you want to have formal german an

00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:14,180
informal german that's a bit more

00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:16,820
complex because there you probably want

00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:19,670
to fall back on a translation or that's

00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:22,820
already a translation and that is not

00:41:19,670 --> 00:41:24,619
possible into play core however the

00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:27,530
dependency injection architecture that

00:41:24,619 --> 00:41:30,410
was built in Drupal 8 is supports a

00:41:27,530 --> 00:41:33,290
contributed module to very easily swept

00:41:30,410 --> 00:41:36,170
out the T functions backhand and do a

00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:38,210
fallback system so the T function is as

00:41:36,170 --> 00:41:41,240
dependency injected so the logic inside

00:41:38,210 --> 00:41:42,770
it is is replaceable so contributed

00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:44,780
module can very easily do language

00:41:42,770 --> 00:41:46,040
fallbacks across even different language

00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:47,869
translations so if you don't have a

00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:51,830
translation in one language it could

00:41:47,869 --> 00:41:53,540
fall back to another one this by the way

00:41:51,830 --> 00:41:55,369
that's the system we even use to

00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:57,590
simplify the developer experience of

00:41:55,369 --> 00:41:59,030
Drupal 8 now you can use the T function

00:41:57,590 --> 00:42:01,369
everywhere even if you don't yet have a

00:41:59,030 --> 00:42:04,180
database setup it works because its

00:42:01,369 --> 00:42:07,359
dependency injector is very powerful

00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:07,359
other questions

00:42:11,479 --> 00:42:18,630
so that translation interface is not

00:42:15,809 --> 00:42:21,150
very good at the moment and is it

00:42:18,630 --> 00:42:23,579
possible in Drupal 8 to define

00:42:21,150 --> 00:42:26,069
translation groups so all your

00:42:23,579 --> 00:42:28,380
translations in the front end would be

00:42:26,069 --> 00:42:30,739
packed into one group so your client

00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:33,900
would only be able to see that one group

00:42:30,739 --> 00:42:35,999
since we've got like thirty three

00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:39,749
languages they need to translate and

00:42:35,999 --> 00:42:42,109
it's a Miss we made our own system so

00:42:39,749 --> 00:42:48,420
you want to so you want to group by what

00:42:42,109 --> 00:42:52,829
a front end or just something because

00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:54,779
it's like the context you can define the

00:42:52,829 --> 00:42:57,509
context but you can't sort it in the

00:42:54,779 --> 00:43:00,619
translation interface or you can't just

00:42:57,509 --> 00:43:05,849
show this context it just marked as

00:43:00,619 --> 00:43:08,309
contact something yes so yes so Drupal 7

00:43:05,849 --> 00:43:10,739
already has contact contacts that's

00:43:08,309 --> 00:43:12,989
possible to assign two strings it is not

00:43:10,739 --> 00:43:15,210
for front and back-end separation though

00:43:12,989 --> 00:43:17,130
it's more for informing translators

00:43:15,210 --> 00:43:19,799
about whether like whether the word

00:43:17,130 --> 00:43:21,569
check is for a check that you that's the

00:43:19,799 --> 00:43:23,729
paper check or whether it's checking out

00:43:21,569 --> 00:43:26,309
something or stuff like that so it's for

00:43:23,729 --> 00:43:28,400
the defining additional providing

00:43:26,309 --> 00:43:31,410
additional information for shorts drinks

00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:33,599
unfortunately how Drupal is structured

00:43:31,410 --> 00:43:35,819
it's very hard to tell if a string is

00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:38,190
going to show up on the back end or the

00:43:35,819 --> 00:43:40,469
front end so like there's a module that

00:43:38,190 --> 00:43:42,960
count as some strings coming from code

00:43:40,469 --> 00:43:45,029
and there are a lot of usable components

00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:47,009
that are maybe used on the front end or

00:43:45,029 --> 00:43:50,339
may be used on the back end it's very

00:43:47,009 --> 00:43:52,319
hard to tell so what so I have an idea

00:43:50,339 --> 00:43:53,789
so if somebody wants to build a

00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:56,190
contributed modules you can build this

00:43:53,789 --> 00:43:58,229
out because it's very possible to build

00:43:56,190 --> 00:44:01,890
a contributed module that gets this

00:43:58,229 --> 00:44:03,930
information from your site so there's a

00:44:01,890 --> 00:44:05,940
module called the localization client

00:44:03,930 --> 00:44:07,469
module that collects all the strings

00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:09,450
that have been used on the page and it

00:44:07,469 --> 00:44:10,979
displays it at the bottom and then you

00:44:09,450 --> 00:44:13,650
can in place translate it it's not

00:44:10,979 --> 00:44:16,249
available yet for Drupal 8 it's 47 that

00:44:13,650 --> 00:44:18,119
the technology that that module is using

00:44:16,249 --> 00:44:21,269
collecting all the strings that have

00:44:18,119 --> 00:44:24,010
been used on the page can be used to run

00:44:21,269 --> 00:44:26,050
a run logic on your site for a week

00:44:24,010 --> 00:44:27,910
two weeks and then it will collect

00:44:26,050 --> 00:44:29,100
strings that are used on a page and it

00:44:27,910 --> 00:44:31,330
will start at location information

00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:33,790
drupal 8 can store much more granular

00:44:31,330 --> 00:44:36,040
location information for Strings now by

00:44:33,790 --> 00:44:38,110
the way and then after a week or two you

00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:39,910
have all the information about which

00:44:38,110 --> 00:44:41,650
strings are used on which paths on your

00:44:39,910 --> 00:44:43,330
site and then you have a much better

00:44:41,650 --> 00:44:45,280
idea about which strings are front-end

00:44:43,330 --> 00:44:48,940
and back-end so Drupal does not know

00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:50,980
that and and it's really depend on how

00:44:48,940 --> 00:44:52,570
it shows up on your site so it's

00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:55,180
possible to build a module that crows

00:44:52,570 --> 00:44:56,980
that that crawls that collects that

00:44:55,180 --> 00:45:00,700
information as time goes on and then you

00:44:56,980 --> 00:45:02,830
have that information I discussed this

00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:04,630
idea and at several conferences and

00:45:02,830 --> 00:45:06,670
nobody build that module yet so somebody

00:45:04,630 --> 00:45:08,530
wants to build that module I think it's

00:45:06,670 --> 00:45:10,420
a great idea because that's a frequent

00:45:08,530 --> 00:45:14,380
requests yes but would it be possible

00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:16,510
just to make it soluble by context and

00:45:14,380 --> 00:45:19,690
once you have the contacts once you have

00:45:16,510 --> 00:45:22,570
that context yes but Drupal court cannot

00:45:19,690 --> 00:45:25,630
tell you that context so like a views

00:45:22,570 --> 00:45:27,370
plugin it has an admin UI part and the

00:45:25,630 --> 00:45:28,720
front-end you I part and some of it will

00:45:27,370 --> 00:45:30,610
show on the front-end some of it will

00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:32,350
show on the back end if you don't expose

00:45:30,610 --> 00:45:33,940
the filter on the UI if you don't expose

00:45:32,350 --> 00:45:35,470
the views filter it will never show on

00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:37,600
the front then you will only show on the

00:45:35,470 --> 00:45:39,040
back end so there's a lot of lot of

00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:41,980
dependencies based on how you configure

00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:44,020
something if you have a field has field

00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:45,790
configuration but you hide it on the

00:45:44,020 --> 00:45:47,560
forum mode you don't show it on the

00:45:45,790 --> 00:45:49,450
front and ever and it's not a front-end

00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:51,310
field it's a back-end field so it's very

00:45:49,450 --> 00:45:53,290
hard there there's a lot of flexibility

00:45:51,310 --> 00:45:55,930
in Drupal core and we can't really know

00:45:53,290 --> 00:45:58,210
off like out of the code what's going to

00:45:55,930 --> 00:46:00,520
happen with that string so it's only

00:45:58,210 --> 00:46:03,220
your site that that through time can

00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:04,630
have that experience itself what's

00:46:03,220 --> 00:46:07,780
appearing on the front end and on the

00:46:04,630 --> 00:46:08,980
back end unfortunately but it's possible

00:46:07,780 --> 00:46:11,560
to write a module we have the technology

00:46:08,980 --> 00:46:15,270
in court to collect that information but

00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:15,270
nobody has written that module yeah

00:46:17,740 --> 00:46:22,830
I can see one more question coming I too

00:46:22,950 --> 00:46:30,390
yeah quick question is a selection of

00:46:27,070 --> 00:46:33,250
the translate interface and content

00:46:30,390 --> 00:46:37,990
translation still separating can I have

00:46:33,250 --> 00:46:43,540
only a French back in and some like

00:46:37,990 --> 00:46:45,640
eight language in fronting yes so so

00:46:43,540 --> 00:46:48,130
there's so what I've shown I enable the

00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:50,050
language switcher block but in Drupal 7

00:46:48,130 --> 00:46:51,400
if you have the energy translation

00:46:50,050 --> 00:46:53,170
module able you have like two or three

00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:56,560
language switcher blocks which is very

00:46:53,170 --> 00:46:58,420
confusing so in eight we only show one

00:46:56,560 --> 00:47:01,270
one block by default and one language

00:46:58,420 --> 00:47:02,680
type but you can enable content language

00:47:01,270 --> 00:47:04,480
to be separate from interface language

00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:06,940
that's also a checkbox on the interface

00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:08,710
on the language selection and then you

00:47:06,940 --> 00:47:10,600
can configure them separately and then

00:47:08,710 --> 00:47:13,240
you can configure have different blocks

00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:14,950
for fall back so that flexibility is in

00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:17,080
there but it's not shown by default

00:47:14,950 --> 00:47:20,530
because it was confusing but it's still

00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:23,410
possible okay and another one is you

00:47:20,530 --> 00:47:25,960
talked about language customization like

00:47:23,410 --> 00:47:30,280
for informal English or commercial

00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:33,460
context will that be uploaded to

00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:36,190
localize or is there some plan to do

00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:39,790
some I don't know inheritance in

00:47:36,190 --> 00:47:42,190
language on localize there is a great

00:47:39,790 --> 00:47:44,080
issue on localize Drupal dark which

00:47:42,190 --> 00:47:48,280
actually has some code to have language

00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:50,890
inheritance so the main so the main

00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:56,140
issue with localized to pull org is it's

00:47:50,890 --> 00:47:58,570
running on Drupal 6 and now that Drupal

00:47:56,140 --> 00:48:00,220
8 is hopefully about to be released then

00:47:58,570 --> 00:48:01,690
we don't want to build new functionality

00:48:00,220 --> 00:48:03,760
on Drupal 6 people that we supported

00:48:01,690 --> 00:48:06,580
anymore so we want to bring that site

00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:08,410
over to Drupal 7 and there is much less

00:48:06,580 --> 00:48:10,690
people working on localized then on

00:48:08,410 --> 00:48:12,670
drupal.org itself and Drupal the door

00:48:10,690 --> 00:48:14,109
itself I've got a long way to update to

00:48:12,670 --> 00:48:16,600
Drupal 7 so there is an ongoing process

00:48:14,109 --> 00:48:19,930
to update the site to Drupal 7 but it's

00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:24,640
not done so we need more people to help

00:48:19,930 --> 00:48:26,410
with that and we actually have a post on

00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:29,800
localize Drupal at work to help with

00:48:26,410 --> 00:48:31,510
that as you probably know so once we

00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:33,340
port that to Drupal 7 then week

00:48:31,510 --> 00:48:35,140
an extended functionality to however

00:48:33,340 --> 00:48:37,210
wide we want we have a lot of feature

00:48:35,140 --> 00:48:39,520
requests from different teams and we

00:48:37,210 --> 00:48:41,350
really want to improve the experience of

00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:44,800
moderating strings and language

00:48:41,350 --> 00:48:46,630
inheritance and activity monitoring and

00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:48,370
all kinds of other things so that you

00:48:46,630 --> 00:48:53,470
can be more effective in translations

00:48:48,370 --> 00:48:55,600
Thanks thank you I want to know if it's

00:48:53,470 --> 00:48:59,080
possible to reap the benefits of

00:48:55,600 --> 00:49:04,420
automatic translation updates for your

00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:10,120
modules that are not on drupal.org is it

00:49:04,420 --> 00:49:12,040
possible yes so so so the we so we use

00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:14,920
the back so the automated translation

00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:17,800
updates uses the back end of the update

00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:20,200
module and the update module has this

00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:22,300
idea of the project source so by default

00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:25,180
the project sources updates drupal org

00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:27,280
where it gets all the update data but if

00:49:25,180 --> 00:49:29,050
the project versus somewhere else then

00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:30,490
we get the update data from there the

00:49:29,050 --> 00:49:32,620
version numbers that whether we need to

00:49:30,490 --> 00:49:34,810
download something and there is also

00:49:32,620 --> 00:49:36,790
localization project URL which can be

00:49:34,810 --> 00:49:38,770
different per project so if you have a

00:49:36,790 --> 00:49:40,810
module that you built for your own then

00:49:38,770 --> 00:49:43,780
it then it then it can very well have

00:49:40,810 --> 00:49:45,820
its own its own translation source URL

00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:47,200
and it will get all the updates from

00:49:45,820 --> 00:49:50,970
there as well yeah it's totally possible

00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:50,970
yes thank you

00:50:09,029 --> 00:50:12,199
my website

00:50:24,359 --> 00:50:29,039
so the question was if it is possible to

00:50:26,579 --> 00:50:31,920
block modules when they have wrong

00:50:29,039 --> 00:50:38,970
translations to get to get downloaded to

00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:41,099
your site so so I think the answer to

00:50:38,970 --> 00:50:44,880
that is probably no there is no core

00:50:41,099 --> 00:50:46,680
solution for that you can like it is

00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:49,049
possible to write a module to alter the

00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:50,549
project information and like have a page

00:50:49,049 --> 00:50:52,109
where you can check out modules that you

00:50:50,549 --> 00:50:54,210
never want to get translation updates

00:50:52,109 --> 00:50:56,460
from but there's no court user interface

00:50:54,210 --> 00:50:57,839
to like configure by module whether you

00:50:56,460 --> 00:51:01,049
want to have this module updates for

00:50:57,839 --> 00:51:05,759
that module updates it's all it's all

00:51:01,049 --> 00:51:08,460
applied to all the modules if they have

00:51:05,759 --> 00:51:09,869
so I think if they have wrong

00:51:08,460 --> 00:51:13,829
translations you probably want to have

00:51:09,869 --> 00:51:15,450
english translations instead I guess so

00:51:13,829 --> 00:51:16,950
it's also possible to write a module

00:51:15,450 --> 00:51:18,210
based on the trans the downloaded

00:51:16,950 --> 00:51:20,640
translations to remove those

00:51:18,210 --> 00:51:22,049
translations from your site or so

00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:24,089
there's different ways to write a module

00:51:22,049 --> 00:51:27,170
to solve this problem but there is no

00:51:24,089 --> 00:51:29,640
course solution to to solve this problem

00:51:27,170 --> 00:51:31,739
the best solution to go and help with

00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:36,660
those translations and my make them both

00:51:31,739 --> 00:51:38,579
better yes submit them and then get them

00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:42,890
try to get them reviewed yeah I know

00:51:38,579 --> 00:51:42,890
that's it's sometimes you get ignored

00:51:45,289 --> 00:51:53,460
thank you I have Christine about the

00:51:49,279 --> 00:51:56,210
about the you know when you have strings

00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:59,309
that you find and you want to translate

00:51:56,210 --> 00:52:02,069
not specially just from the motors but

00:51:59,309 --> 00:52:04,440
from for example if you have a login or

00:52:02,069 --> 00:52:07,249
or a string of that to have that

00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:12,089
translated as an inline translation

00:52:07,249 --> 00:52:16,019
where you have what I am actually trying

00:52:12,089 --> 00:52:21,329
to reference is from from the Magento

00:52:16,019 --> 00:52:24,150
web commerce system you can enable to

00:52:21,329 --> 00:52:28,730
have inland translations displayed and

00:52:24,150 --> 00:52:31,769
you'll just pick out this one string and

00:52:28,730 --> 00:52:33,809
translate it translate that in line when

00:52:31,769 --> 00:52:36,690
you are working instead of going into

00:52:33,809 --> 00:52:37,630
the back end and translate the strings

00:52:36,690 --> 00:52:42,579
there

00:52:37,630 --> 00:52:45,579
yeah so almost so what we have we have a

00:52:42,579 --> 00:52:47,049
localization client module that collects

00:52:45,579 --> 00:52:48,759
all the strings that have been displayed

00:52:47,049 --> 00:52:50,349
on a patient has a toolbar at the bottom

00:52:48,759 --> 00:52:51,940
of the screen that contains all the

00:52:50,349 --> 00:52:54,039
strings on the page and has a search

00:52:51,940 --> 00:52:56,079
feature so you can search for the string

00:52:54,039 --> 00:52:57,789
and you can translate it there we don't

00:52:56,079 --> 00:52:59,319
have in place translation there's a very

00:52:57,789 --> 00:53:03,849
long-standing feature request in that

00:52:59,319 --> 00:53:07,000
module to have that the so it may be

00:53:03,849 --> 00:53:10,059
possible in some cases to do that the

00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:12,250
problem is when we translate it we can't

00:53:10,059 --> 00:53:14,309
really inject any additional markup or

00:53:12,250 --> 00:53:16,569
any behavior to that to that text

00:53:14,309 --> 00:53:18,430
because we have all these security

00:53:16,569 --> 00:53:20,470
measures that it may be escaped on

00:53:18,430 --> 00:53:22,480
escaped later on in the page display

00:53:20,470 --> 00:53:26,019
process then we'll screw up your page

00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:27,460
displayed all together so we can't

00:53:26,019 --> 00:53:29,740
really add an additional markup or

00:53:27,460 --> 00:53:31,480
information about the source string so

00:53:29,740 --> 00:53:33,549
when you when the page is downloaded we

00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:35,950
can't really tell which part of the page

00:53:33,549 --> 00:53:38,829
comes from which source string so we

00:53:35,950 --> 00:53:40,930
can't really like do things like click

00:53:38,829 --> 00:53:43,089
there and translate it it may be

00:53:40,930 --> 00:53:45,819
possible in some limited cases but it

00:53:43,089 --> 00:53:47,710
but it but we so far had a hard time

00:53:45,819 --> 00:53:50,079
imagining how we can do it generally

00:53:47,710 --> 00:53:52,299
there's a very long standing issue in

00:53:50,079 --> 00:53:54,849
the Alton and underscore Client modules

00:53:52,299 --> 00:53:56,619
issue queue to have click clickable

00:53:54,849 --> 00:53:58,599
clickable page elements that you can

00:53:56,619 --> 00:54:00,309
just click and translate in place so you

00:53:58,599 --> 00:54:02,859
can look there and look at all the

00:54:00,309 --> 00:54:05,309
discussions and arguments and why and

00:54:02,859 --> 00:54:07,509
what we tried and where we failed

00:54:05,309 --> 00:54:09,400
there's there's a lot of things that we

00:54:07,509 --> 00:54:11,650
looked at Android and we so far haven't

00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:16,839
been able to crack that problem thank

00:54:11,650 --> 00:54:18,400
you so what if you already have notes

00:54:16,839 --> 00:54:20,980
that have been translated but haven't

00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:22,900
been associated together i know with i

00:54:20,980 --> 00:54:24,519
18 n there's a way to do that where you

00:54:22,900 --> 00:54:27,039
get a nice little table and you can

00:54:24,519 --> 00:54:30,819
select the existing nodes I didn't see

00:54:27,039 --> 00:54:33,460
that in the screenshots yes so n in this

00:54:30,819 --> 00:54:36,730
case in Drupal 8 all entity translations

00:54:33,460 --> 00:54:38,740
are stored in the same entity so they

00:54:36,730 --> 00:54:41,140
will not need to be an associate in any

00:54:38,740 --> 00:54:43,539
way because it's the same entity if you

00:54:41,140 --> 00:54:45,640
have content from before to plate or in

00:54:43,539 --> 00:54:47,710
Drupal 8 for some reason you create

00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:51,190
separate pieces of content and you need

00:54:47,710 --> 00:54:52,869
to later on associate them then

00:54:51,190 --> 00:54:54,430
we will need a solution for that we

00:54:52,869 --> 00:54:57,670
don't have a solution for merging those

00:54:54,430 --> 00:54:59,020
entities into 1s translations but we

00:54:57,670 --> 00:55:01,060
will need to build that functionality

00:54:59,020 --> 00:55:02,770
for the migration path we actually have

00:55:01,060 --> 00:55:05,410
a half code for that in the entity

00:55:02,770 --> 00:55:07,089
translation Drupal 7 version so we have

00:55:05,410 --> 00:55:09,339
code for that migration but we need to

00:55:07,089 --> 00:55:11,619
pour that to do plate and once we have

00:55:09,339 --> 00:55:13,030
that code we can release a version of

00:55:11,619 --> 00:55:15,099
that module or we can have a sub-module

00:55:13,030 --> 00:55:18,550
day or something that allows you to do

00:55:15,099 --> 00:55:20,079
these merges and then they will be funky

00:55:18,550 --> 00:55:21,609
functionally identical to that process

00:55:20,079 --> 00:55:24,520
where you save this note that node

00:55:21,609 --> 00:55:26,740
please put them up as translations and

00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:28,569
put them together okay that'll be very

00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:31,450
helpful for those doing big migrations

00:55:28,569 --> 00:55:32,890
from yes joomla fortune indeed so the

00:55:31,450 --> 00:55:35,230
logic already needs to be in the

00:55:32,890 --> 00:55:37,270
migration path so I'm not concerned that

00:55:35,230 --> 00:55:39,040
it will not be written we then need to

00:55:37,270 --> 00:55:40,300
write it in a way is a very good point

00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:42,520
that we need to write it in a way that

00:55:40,300 --> 00:55:44,290
it's available as a generic solution for

00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:52,500
later on as well we need to merge things

00:55:44,290 --> 00:55:52,500
