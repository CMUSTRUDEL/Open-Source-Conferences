Title: DrupalCon Prague 2013: INTRODUCING USER-CENTERED DESIGN IN A 100.000+ PERSON CORPORATION
Publication date: 2013-09-26
Playlist: DrupalCon Prague - September 2013
Description: 
	How hard it can be to push innovation within a huge corporation that is using Drupal? Marek, who's been known in Drupal community as a Designer, Themer and Developer for over 7 years now, is trying to introduce user centered design, on a Drupal based project, for the past year in his new contract role in one of the largest bank in the world.

In Drupal world we often take default user interface as the best practice and granted that it works as intended. For example, the search button, that has the "Search" word as an action. Have you ever thought about whether that button works for your application? How about a little research to improve its performance?

Marek will tell you the story of a person coming from freelance world to a big rigid corporation. What impact has a detailed research about users behaviour on the project and team members? Is it easy to succeed in changing the mindset that is focused on fulfilling managers wishes aka "success driven approach"â„¢ only and not taking users needs in consideration? How can you stand your ground when presenting your UX improvements when questioned?

After seeing this session you will get an overview on how to introduce user-centered design within any organization or project, what it takes and what role you and team members play in it. You will think about users more (but keeping the business goals in mind). You will learn about research approaches that were taken and how did they help, which you can then apply for your projects and clients to increase conversion rate.

okay I guess we are ready to start so

00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:10,290
hello everybody I'm very pleased to be

00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:12,360

here because you are in my home Saturday

00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:17,039
and I was actually born here and I just

00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:18,630
wanted to ask how many of you read my

00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,550
blog post about the practice because

00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:23,430
there are a lot of people saying that

00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:27,420
it's good so I really like that okay

00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:30,570
cool so this session is about my story

00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:32,369
going through a kind of experience being

00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:36,420
a freelancer and then going into the

00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:39,210
enterprise and so my name is Mark so doc

00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:41,899
and I am a web developer for about 12

00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:44,489
years I am a drupal developer for about

00:00:41,899 --> 00:00:46,500
past seven years and forty seven weeks

00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:49,320
which is almost eight years so that's a

00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:51,329
long time I also do design research and

00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:53,309
user experience everything around user

00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:55,770
experience experience I don't have

00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:58,100
really a title that I can say like user

00:00:55,770 --> 00:01:00,870
experience ninja or something like that

00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:02,550
I'm also a founder of an inline manual

00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:05,070
which is kind of like my startup which

00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:07,110
focuses on documentation for end users

00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:09,299
so if you want to check it out come come

00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:12,450
over and i also found it a little

00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:13,799
company drupal shop back in London where

00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:15,810
I used to live for about three years

00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:19,830
which is called atomic and limited and

00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:23,880
we are building websites using Drupal so

00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:25,590
this story so me coming from a freelance

00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:27,840
world well I never really worked for a

00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:30,119
company only like in these past 12 years

00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:34,680
that was just like one year together

00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:38,549
being employed and there was one day I

00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:40,229
got a call from a recruiter and that

00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:42,600
recruiter just called me up and said

00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:46,770
well we we are looking for someone in

00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:50,549
Switzerland to build to actually hire

00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:55,049
someone that is triple themer basically

00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:56,880
and doing drupal front end and so they

00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:59,490
called me up and I was in a position

00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,960
where we were actually moving I was here

00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:02,759
in Prague and we were moving to a new

00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,219
flat with a really nice terrace

00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:07,320
overlooking to the whole place the whole

00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:10,890
proc it was even nice reviews than you

00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:12,480
have here in carinthia well there so I

00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:13,690
wasn't really sure if I want to go there

00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:17,470
so I just

00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:19,870
well whatever what can you offer and you

00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:21,280
know like I was really being mean and I

00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:23,020
just said okay well I need these

00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:29,500
conditions and that caution conditions

00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:31,240
and I set the price really high and yeah

00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:33,520
and then after like three days they came

00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:36,040
back and I had another interview which

00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:37,570
was quite nice and they actually after

00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:39,850
these three days they called me back

00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:41,830
again so just saying that we are in this

00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:44,710
position as a true drupal people where

00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:46,660
is really high demand demand and you can

00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:50,800
really say anything that you want your

00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:52,750
conditions so my friends advised me like

00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,330
not to go there because it's a bank it's

00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:57,490
a Swiss bank and they always told me

00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:59,470
like okay run away or don't go there

00:02:57,490 --> 00:03:03,010
it's a rigid structure and I never

00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:08,470
experienced this kind of enterprise you

00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:10,180
know enterprise area so then I said to

00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:11,980
myself okay well what what will make me

00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:14,140
happy and you yeah that would be like

00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:15,790
this what I want to do just the simple

00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:17,530
bit and I was really specific what I

00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:19,720
want to do and that was just theming and

00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:22,810
you know theming is quite easy in Drupal

00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:28,360
so that was enough and I I asked for a

00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:31,239
high salary and then yeah then accepted

00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:38,890
I challenge accepted and I just went

00:03:31,239 --> 00:03:40,420
there so it took me almost six months I

00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:42,190
mean the contract was just for three

00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:43,900
months there the first three months I

00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:45,459
was just exploring stuff that's the

00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:48,459
other three months when they extended it

00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:49,989
I was still exploring I was

00:03:48,459 --> 00:03:52,330
understanding what's happening there and

00:03:49,989 --> 00:03:55,000
the slap you were working on was the

00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:57,730
support portal for about 100,000

00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,769
employees there and it was a self help

00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:01,900
support portal with a knowledge base so

00:03:59,769 --> 00:04:04,540
that basically means that the users

00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:06,070
should be able to help themselves and

00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:09,640
you know if they have a problem they

00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:11,769
should search for a solution and here

00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:13,720
fine without you know picking up a phone

00:04:11,769 --> 00:04:17,019
and calling support which is much more

00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:19,180
expensive and it also integrates with

00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:22,979
other systems proprietary systems a big

00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:25,450
ones so my first observations were

00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:26,590
exactly the same was that my friends

00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:29,770
told me so

00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:31,690
there's a rigid structure you can

00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:33,820
completely forget about being agile in

00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:36,040
this environment at least in my

00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:37,660
experience and what was really

00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:39,610
interesting for me being a freelancer

00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:42,400
and really switching jobs in between

00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:44,500
doing some contracts and stuff they

00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,210
there are people that actually work

00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:48,250
there like 15 years and you know they

00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:50,229
had these batches where they have their

00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:52,720
photo and they were really young they're

00:04:50,229 --> 00:04:54,580
on the photo i was like no that's not

00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,979
you and it's like okay how long are we

00:04:54,580 --> 00:05:00,520
working out well for 15 years and or

00:04:56,979 --> 00:05:02,260
since i was 14 or something like that so

00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:05,889
that's that's really interesting and it

00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:07,419
says something about the culture and it

00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:10,450
also another place where the innovation

00:05:07,419 --> 00:05:12,880
happens and I later explained why and

00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:15,010
mail it is because the people because

00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,750
they are there so long I think if you

00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:18,820
are working somewhere for 15 years and

00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:20,169
you are almost under still on the same

00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:23,590
position but you are just changing

00:05:20,169 --> 00:05:25,000
titles so all of them on our level well

00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:28,150
not all of them but most of them are

00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,070
kind of like associate directors but

00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:32,110
they are still on the same level they

00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:34,330
might be changing the rows of the jobs

00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:36,190
but it's kind of I would say a lot of

00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:39,610
similar to what they were doing for the

00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:42,220
past 15 years and the culture there is

00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:44,289
kind of like or like that they are

00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:45,880
trying to please the people about like

00:05:44,289 --> 00:05:47,970
the managers everyone to keep them happy

00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:51,880
so they don't really think about things

00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:55,419
well not that much we had also these

00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:57,370
monthly cycles which sometimes because

00:05:55,419 --> 00:05:59,590
of these proprietary systems ended up

00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:02,169
being like half a year cycles or even

00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:04,150
more because you know there are some

00:06:02,169 --> 00:06:05,770
dependencies and they didn't fulfill it

00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:09,039
so we were writing for them because we

00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:12,760
had some other feature and and so on it

00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:16,330
was also difficult to decide on Suffolk

00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:18,669
or designs of you know get a sign off

00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:22,990
for some features because the team

00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:24,910
itself the four key people or three key

00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:28,570
people were in in three countries and

00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:30,760
there was another indian guys who are

00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:35,349
doing testing so it was all spread

00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:37,060
around around the world and mainly the

00:06:35,349 --> 00:06:39,909
managers what I found out is that they

00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:40,430
don't know really well they thought that

00:06:39,909 --> 00:06:43,250
they know

00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:46,340
what the users needs what are the users

00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:49,310
needs and what you know what what they

00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:50,690
can offer and I'll to make it work or

00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:53,300
actually that's what they were saying

00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:55,880
but they didn't and there were no

00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:59,680
analytics no research whatsoever but

00:06:55,880 --> 00:07:03,050
they knew what what the user needs of

00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:05,960
then you know everyone now is kind of

00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:08,510
making some nice name so i made one on

00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:11,990
myself it's a sextant success driven

00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:13,790
metrics based on percentage and it in

00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:15,680
practice it's kind of like i had this

00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:17,690
one business analyst who came to me and

00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,850
that was after i did some research or a

00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:22,160
day and she knew that i'm doing some

00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:24,170
research and she asked me well I need to

00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:27,920
prove that this we had there like a

00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:29,720
forum communities and it wasn't it was

00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:32,450
failed basically because there were no

00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:34,970
people they weren't answering helping

00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:38,900
each other I guess it's also because

00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:40,910
it's in the bank and she came to me and

00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:43,370
asked well I need to make this form the

00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:45,590
particle forum a success can you give me

00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:47,300
some metrics which will prove it because

00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:49,970
she saw okay there's another forum which

00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:52,820
has just let's say two replete replies

00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:54,620
and another forum has like 20 replies so

00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:56,510
you know obviously that for success and

00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:58,160
she wanted it in percentage so that

00:07:56,510 --> 00:08:02,960
would be like two hundred percent or

00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:04,880
yeah or more success and but if you

00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:07,600
looked into the forum where we're like

00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:10,040
20 replies you would found out that

00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:14,800
let's say 18 replies of the East for

00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:14,800
moderators that's what they didn't see

00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:20,240
also it wasn't really clear who is there

00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:22,490
like leader or in the project so there's

00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:26,050
no I mean this is supposed to be do

00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:28,640
managers but that wasn't the case and

00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:30,230
everyone was even looking up to them so

00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:31,850
they were writing for the for the axial

00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:34,850
direction or show them the right

00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:37,040
direction and if I ask someone well

00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:38,570
where is this project heading they

00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:43,190
didn't know they were just waiting from

00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:46,490
one village to another so after these

00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:48,380
six months I said mouth to myself while

00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:50,540
the contract ends in three months I

00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:52,490
haven't seen much progress because I was

00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:53,420
doing just steaming and then development

00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:57,649
and out of

00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:59,750
Thanks and so I thought well I thought

00:08:57,649 --> 00:09:03,440
to myself well if I'm going to spend or

00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:05,089
basically waste more time here what

00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,639
should i do I should try to change

00:09:05,089 --> 00:09:09,980
something not be part of this of this

00:09:07,639 --> 00:09:11,829
group where they are like 15 years there

00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:16,880
and they are just listening afterwards

00:09:11,829 --> 00:09:18,980
so so thinking should I stay or should I

00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:20,959
leave because I didn't really care if i

00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:22,399
lose the job because you know beat

00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:27,589
drupal developers have jobs everywhere

00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:30,260
and so my first attempt was that i was

00:09:27,589 --> 00:09:32,329
walking around the office and from time

00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:33,860
to time i was just asking these people

00:09:32,329 --> 00:09:35,510
that were there so long i was asking

00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:38,560
them like just discussing what are you

00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:41,149
doing and how you're approaching things

00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:42,920
and what is your role in the project and

00:09:41,149 --> 00:09:44,480
everyone was kind of happy because

00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:48,440
nobody asked them before you know and

00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:51,709
you have to talk to people and i learned

00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:54,290
some interesting things so i was trying

00:09:51,709 --> 00:09:56,329
to get to know people around i was

00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:59,449
trying to bring ideas and innovation

00:09:56,329 --> 00:10:04,579
during the meetings and use my you use

00:09:59,449 --> 00:10:07,459
my previous experience but it kind of

00:10:04,579 --> 00:10:09,649
failed because it was always by the

00:10:07,459 --> 00:10:12,769
managers whatever magic managers

00:10:09,649 --> 00:10:16,760
required or put n likely requirements

00:10:12,769 --> 00:10:19,730
and so I didn't even get any real

00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:23,149
feedback from from anyone just like okay

00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:25,459
this is a nice idea so I was frustrated

00:10:23,149 --> 00:10:30,230
again and it was like after three weeks

00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:33,350
or so the second item I thought okay

00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:36,410
well it was the periods were there were

00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:39,350
holidays so there was less pressure on

00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:41,209
the on our team on the build team and as

00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:45,100
I said I was originally hard for as a

00:10:41,209 --> 00:10:48,140
developer themer themer primarily and

00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:49,880
they didn't want or they didn't throw

00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:54,410
that i will be doing this kind of work

00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:55,790
like research and stuff and so I thought

00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:57,440
okay let's let's give it some structure

00:10:55,790 --> 00:11:01,250
let's let's do some kind of approach

00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:03,610
something more more convenient so I

00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:06,710
started a research and I base it on a

00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:09,890
principles around you UCD which is the

00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:13,520
user centric design how many of you know

00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:15,500
about the user centric design okay note

00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:16,960
that money I guess you will find out

00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:22,090
that you that's something you are doing

00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:25,370
every day but this is the definition

00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:28,430
basically you are focusing on the user

00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:31,370
needs once and limitations while they

00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:33,470
are using your product and so we are

00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:36,980
really trying to implement what would

00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:38,690
these aspects in in every process every

00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:42,590
design process during when you are

00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:45,010
building the product and then if you

00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:48,260
follow that you should be able to design

00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:51,200
you know a product that will be based on

00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:53,270
or in it was support the internet users

00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:56,240
existing beliefs attitudes and behaviors

00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:58,100
and so on and this means that you will

00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:01,640
kind of build a user friendly user

00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:03,950
bullet usable product which might later

00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:09,140
increase sales which business goals in

00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:11,270
our case lower the support calls just

00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:13,640
briefly you can use these user

00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:15,740
perspectives of which our needs and once

00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:18,410
cause motivation and triggers optics

00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:22,340
obstacles and limitations during your

00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:24,710
research I mean you can see this kind of

00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:27,650
less user perspectives can be long and

00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:29,600
it not always will fit for your needs so

00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:31,430
for example geography and language won't

00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:36,110
fit for every project and stuff like

00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:39,200
that so use your common sense and UCD is

00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:41,420
not just that you have to if it's called

00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:43,550
user centric design it doesn't mean that

00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:47,180
you really need to do everything that

00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:50,090
user asks you and there's a one check

00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:51,800
entrepreneur or was dommage but I don't

00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:54,170
know if you some of you might know him

00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:56,210
or at least the logo his it was a

00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:58,340
shoemaker and this brand still exists

00:12:56,210 --> 00:13:00,550
and he always said our customers our

00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:03,980
master and I'm sure he didn't mean it

00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:06,560
exactly or you know like like it's

00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:08,240
written so if everyone will come back

00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,710
and say okay I don't like let's say this

00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,780
color of the shoe then they won't

00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:15,290
immediately create a whole collections

00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:17,660
of new shoes and there's also this

00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:19,370
brilliant quote which says people don't

00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:20,450
want to buy a quarter-inch drill they

00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:22,910
want to buy a quarter in

00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:26,270
help each hole so for example if you

00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:29,270
have a if you have a guy coming to the

00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:33,050
to the shop and asking the salesman I

00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:34,970
need a drill and the user the salesman

00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:37,730
will just give him a drill without any

00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:40,130
questions then you know the guy will

00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:42,920
just get the drill go home and probably

00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:45,350
make some holes but he doesn't know you

00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:46,940
know for the drill does but if the

00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:50,090
salesman actually asked him like okay

00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:52,820
well what do you need to jail for and he

00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:56,990
would say well I need to put their like

00:13:52,820 --> 00:14:00,500
have d how it's called let's hit a nail

00:13:56,990 --> 00:14:01,970
or something and then if he asks more

00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:05,660
and more than he will find out that it

00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:10,130
this guy doesn't need a drill but he

00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:12,020
needs a hole akshay there are several

00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:15,950
disciplines again it's just this is just

00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:18,080
a you have one of these but you can put

00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:21,920
in anything you want or use and I think

00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:23,990
you want the process it's quite simple

00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:26,530
you just do the research then the

00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:29,500
concept which could be like very frames

00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:33,110
design you just create the prototypes

00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:35,300
like low fidelity prototypes and then

00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:38,900
you evaluate that means like you test

00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:41,300
with the users you you have whatever is

00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:44,240
convenient for the project I would add

00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:50,120
to this to other things which is deploy

00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:52,790
and learn and question how many of you

00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:53,780
actually do something after you launch a

00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:59,510
website do you do any research

00:14:53,780 --> 00:15:01,880
afterwards how it's being used okay but

00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:04,160
not much I think I think that's kind of

00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:06,950
like a key thing for us for like web

00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:09,410
designers developers because still now

00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:11,900
if you if you have let's say some

00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:13,940
research some or if you don't use

00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:15,560
research before it's all your

00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:17,630
assumptions and your skills that you had

00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:19,490
before and after you launch something

00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:21,500
that that is the point where you can

00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:23,120
start learning new things because that's

00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:26,840
something you implement it and something

00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:29,540
you believe that would work so if you

00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:31,700
are not doing this try it once even on a

00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:33,690
small thing and you will see that you

00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:39,030
can you can improve their

00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:42,380
so I started a research and I was

00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:45,570
questioning myself ok what do research

00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:47,880
there was a nice talk from Eric Ries

00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:50,640
actually and he was asking is why and if

00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:53,820
you learn Durden look it up on the on

00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:55,740
the web afterwards but I started this

00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:57,780
kind of micro approach because I knew or

00:15:55,740 --> 00:16:00,450
I have seen that in the in the company

00:15:57,780 --> 00:16:03,000
itself everyone was chipping in everyone

00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:05,610
was kind of developing their own ideas

00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:09,600
without without any research and I think

00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:12,150
just based on the assumption and so I

00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:15,210
took just one thing just simple thing or

00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:18,930
I wanted to pick one thing and analyze

00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:20,580
that and I didn't have anything like you

00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:22,170
know like you have google analytics

00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:25,560
because it's a bank it's a closed bank

00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:28,230
you can't have data out data outside or

00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:30,660
over hosted somewhere else so I choose

00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:33,480
that just a simple thing that we had and

00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:36,630
that was the excess log which is quite

00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:38,100
geeky I would say and that's something

00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:39,810
that lets say in Drupal you can see in

00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:41,550
the reporting and these kind of like

00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:44,550
referers and stuff that's all coming

00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:49,320
from excess locks so I started with that

00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:52,050
and you know if I would go to because of

00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:56,010
course there are some reporting done by

00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:57,510
the reporting team but you know asking

00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:59,040
them it would just throw in more

00:16:57,510 --> 00:17:01,440
obstacles because they would be asking

00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:03,949
what you want to research and yeah that

00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:08,670
would be a strange exchange okay I think

00:17:03,949 --> 00:17:13,439
so i did this i know if you can see it i

00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:16,860
hope you can this is just a basic you

00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:19,199
know graph or a chart that shows what i

00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:22,800
did actually is i took the whole access

00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:24,600
log and based on the bath like you have

00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:28,110
to clean path so let's say with andrew

00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:32,040
play F node / node ID so I took this and

00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:34,440
created a kind of like a tree so that's

00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:37,710
just running through the one week of

00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:39,780
locks I did this and immediately be so

00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:42,320
which parts are being used of the

00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:45,470
website they didn't have this before or

00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:51,860
something really in a basic shape

00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:54,770
and then I did another one which is like

00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:58,190
showing the user flow this is like a

00:17:54,770 --> 00:18:00,530
dendogram it's using the d3 library in

00:17:58,190 --> 00:18:05,559
JavaScript and it was quite complex to

00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:08,960
write but you can see these the brown

00:18:05,559 --> 00:18:12,200
lines that are going around are actually

00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:14,630
that users are coming back over and you

00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:15,799
can see the flow there so this was quite

00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:17,630
helpful because this is as well

00:18:15,799 --> 00:18:19,549
interactive so we can click on one one

00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:22,580
path and it will show you where the

00:18:19,549 --> 00:18:26,890
users are going and I mean they had

00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:26,890
really a lot of fun when they saw this

00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:38,330
so I chose to use the search as my of

00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:39,830
item for researching because the the

00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:40,970
search is kind of kind of like the most

00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:42,830
valuable functionality of the

00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:46,580
self-report are so so what if i'm

00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:50,890
looking for a for a solution for a help

00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:50,890
of the search needs to work and

00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:56,960
sometimes like there was this discussion

00:18:54,919 --> 00:18:59,059
in previous session as well that we take

00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:01,610
as granted that the things will work out

00:18:59,059 --> 00:19:04,400
of the box or whatever we take let's

00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:07,039
save it rupal is a good case and we were

00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:08,780
just discussing this that i'll say you

00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:10,880
have a module calendar module and you

00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:13,460
install it you just turn on the module

00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:15,710
and you take that this user interface is

00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:17,630
working because everyone is using it so

00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:20,000
you don't touch it at all and that could

00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:23,330
be from a simple smallest things like

00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,250
search box how many of you actually like

00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:27,679
you know looked into the search whether

00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:33,650
it's working for your users as it should

00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:35,360
yeah just view so we tend to be really

00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:38,929
lazy because we get something for free

00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:41,750
which is there or the kind of works okay

00:19:38,929 --> 00:19:45,799
so this is this is the it can be seen

00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:47,659
this is the initial search box that I

00:19:45,799 --> 00:19:49,850
was working on because I chose just this

00:19:47,659 --> 00:19:52,760
particular part that was on the homepage

00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:54,590
and it was like in a one column in the

00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:56,450
bigger column so you can see here like

00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:58,780
there's a search and find title there's

00:19:56,450 --> 00:20:01,120
a pretty face of a girl

00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:04,930
corporate style you have their search

00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:06,490
placeholder there's even theme of how

00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:08,530
it's called autocomplete so when they

00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:10,240
are typing you know it it gave them

00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:17,110
suggestions and there is the search

00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:19,030
button and like magnifying glass so when

00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:21,550
doing such a research you need to set

00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:23,500
your wealth these were my personal goals

00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:25,870
for me to keep you know doing these

00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:27,790
things and what I wanted to do is to

00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:30,640
show the team that we don't know much

00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:33,340
about the user experience and we don't

00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:35,080
know really what the users are doing and

00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:37,150
I also wanted to showcase some of the

00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:39,520
research approaches so they can you know

00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:42,670
do it themselves and understand that

00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:44,320
there is something more behind and as

00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:46,960
well make the search to be used more

00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:49,150
often and make the user centric design

00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:52,930
one of the processes which is kind of

00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:57,600
like high level go that will take

00:20:52,930 --> 00:21:01,030
probably 10 years from my experience now

00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:02,590
and there needed to be an output so the

00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:05,800
output would be an analysis of how the

00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:08,050
search works and it should be delivered

00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:11,380
as a presentation because people there

00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:13,840
like presentations and it needed to be

00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:15,820
sent out to all the members and most

00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:21,700
importantly as well managers so they can

00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:24,360
notice that oops okay that was a wrong

00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:24,360
key sorry

00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:32,450
right so the search analyzes so we

00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:35,000
wanted to increase the use of the

00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:37,430
sulphur hotel itself which will

00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,470
immediately it should at least decrease

00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:42,190
the race tickets or users actually find

00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:44,450
the right solution for the problem and

00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:46,430
we assumed that the search is not

00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:48,170
working based on the feedback that we

00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:50,030
got from the there is kind of like a

00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:52,460
rating on the portal so users can

00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:54,140
actually rate the service and they

00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:55,640
weren't very happy with the search so

00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:59,120
that's the only kind of input we got

00:21:55,640 --> 00:22:00,980
from the users and the team itself

00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:04,700
already had a lot of improvements based

00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:07,430
on these assumptions and one note about

00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:08,930
assumptions is that as I was saying

00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:12,350
about these managers that they really

00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:15,620
wanted or they really always knew what

00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:18,500
the what the user knows it was always

00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:21,290
just on their assumptions which is not

00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:23,390
always the the best thing if they don't

00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:27,380
have especially don't if they don't have

00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:29,840
the experience so then I created a

00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:32,390
simple scenario it's kind of like a user

00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:35,510
story what would be the ideal simplified

00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:36,980
workflow for a really good you know user

00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:39,050
experience that they can search

00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:41,480
something as simple as that like find a

00:22:39,050 --> 00:22:44,450
search field enter a search term click

00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:46,640
the available action to search if it's

00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:49,580
not found and refine the search read the

00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:52,610
solution optional perform some action

00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:55,640
like increase the rating of the solution

00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:58,130
and then exit peaceful and tell everyone

00:22:55,640 --> 00:23:02,180
how happy they were with the service so

00:22:58,130 --> 00:23:06,310
that was the goal and obviously it

00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:09,500
wasn't like that so I started with the

00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:12,110
kind of researching what users are

00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:14,780
searching for and here you can see

00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:17,000
there's a blank key word or link the

00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:20,720
blank actually is a blank that they type

00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:24,790
in blank the link keyword Nick password

00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:28,340
mind align and so for and first of all

00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:30,290
you see they're like blank and what is

00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:33,410
blank why do they type in blank to

00:23:30,290 --> 00:23:36,590
search for some something so I had to

00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:39,020
ask about this what is blank keyword

00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:40,820
and by the users are searching for that

00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:43,669
and it turned out it's a it's a feature

00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:45,230
of the portal because if you click only

00:23:43,669 --> 00:23:48,230
on the icon it would search for the

00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:51,289
blank keyboard and if there is a blanky

00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:53,960
word it would list all the solutions on

00:23:51,289 --> 00:23:58,100
the portal a bit the pagination but they

00:23:53,960 --> 00:24:00,020
are like a 10,000 solutions and then

00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:03,350
they can filter out because they have

00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:04,940
like filters on the on the side so this

00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:11,029
is kind of interesting approach that I

00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:12,620
haven't seen before anywhere so I wanted

00:24:11,029 --> 00:24:14,899
to prove that the filters are actually

00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:17,380
being used and you can see that I'm

00:24:14,899 --> 00:24:19,460
doing really just small steps

00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:22,480
researching just one functional at a

00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:27,590
step-by-step just looking what is doing

00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:30,770
so there are these URLs addresses which

00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:34,760
you can have from these like as i said i

00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:37,850
was using the access logs and for me it

00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:39,470
was easier to dig into the code and i

00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:41,779
found out that for example the first

00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:45,590
starting page is with filters undefined

00:24:41,779 --> 00:24:48,679
and if they used filters there would be

00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:50,390
something in the content part so it was

00:24:48,679 --> 00:24:52,370
easy to find out which ones were

00:24:50,390 --> 00:25:00,350
undefined and which were which ones were

00:24:52,370 --> 00:25:02,960
content or were holding content so i was

00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:05,120
i really wanted to know how people get

00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:08,659
to this actually a blank page and i was

00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:10,370
expecting that as it was implemented i

00:25:08,659 --> 00:25:12,590
will get many refers back and that's

00:25:10,370 --> 00:25:15,080
just because they you know click just

00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:19,960
the button went there and then they just

00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:25,250
filtered out and again i found out that

00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:28,669
from home it's like 1100 searches let's

00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:31,850
say from five thousand searches and from

00:25:28,669 --> 00:25:34,460
the search page actually 510 referral

00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:38,570
110 and so on and then they were like a

00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:40,669
small part and refer is like we're very

00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:43,460
where they are coming from to the search

00:25:40,669 --> 00:25:45,230
to the actual research so I thought okay

00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:46,669
home why they are coming from home I

00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:47,929
think that they're there must be some

00:25:46,669 --> 00:25:50,330
sort of like a problem why would they

00:25:47,929 --> 00:25:51,940
just you know click the search button

00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:55,220
that's probably not working as it should

00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:58,789
so probably the users were actually you

00:25:55,220 --> 00:26:03,980
know used to just clicking the home I

00:25:58,789 --> 00:26:06,289
think yeah so that was kind of like the

00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:08,269
first problem they shouldn't go that

00:26:06,289 --> 00:26:10,659
they should if they you know approached

00:26:08,269 --> 00:26:13,600
the website i should start searching and

00:26:10,659 --> 00:26:19,010
you shouldn't get to the blank page

00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:22,519
search again why if you searched for a

00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:24,710
keyword why would you you know remove

00:26:22,519 --> 00:26:26,600
the remove the keyboard that you entered

00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:30,320
before and search again with the blank

00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:31,580
space he so that was another problem and

00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:34,100
I found out that's actually an issue

00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:36,200
because if you if you that in that

00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:39,110
implementation if you type in let's say

00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:40,850
a keyboard you search for the first time

00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:43,519
then you search for the second one

00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:47,179
second time from the search page again

00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:48,970
it would automatically becomes default

00:26:47,179 --> 00:26:51,380
to blank so there is a problem with that

00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:55,700
so they weren't able to refine their

00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:57,620
search keyword and then the referral

00:26:55,700 --> 00:27:01,010
which was pointing through to the blank

00:26:57,620 --> 00:27:06,169
page it's there was like a bronc link on

00:27:01,010 --> 00:27:08,360
the internet so if you remember we were

00:27:06,169 --> 00:27:10,880
trying to find these whether the filters

00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:13,820
are working and I found out it from

00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:18,320
these like five thousand felt searches

00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:20,000
only 20 times it was used and let

00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:21,799
suppress the load number so the

00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:25,460
conclusion from that was that the page

00:27:21,799 --> 00:27:28,360
to blank page the blank behavior wasn't

00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:30,529
really working as as it was designed and

00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:34,000
so you can see like from these little

00:27:30,529 --> 00:27:36,590
steps we also find we also found these

00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:39,350
the problems like the the back with a

00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:40,730
search we found it from the home it

00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:43,490
shouldn't be like that and as well this

00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:45,529
intranet broken link and with this just

00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:47,419
a simple research you can achieve its

00:27:45,529 --> 00:27:53,210
these things that were always there but

00:27:47,419 --> 00:27:54,679
nobody nobody reported them and another

00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:56,269
conclusion was that the basic search

00:27:54,679 --> 00:27:59,270
user experience seems frustrating

00:27:56,269 --> 00:28:01,730
because it didn't really you know apply

00:27:59,270 --> 00:28:02,809
to this simple workflow that I defined

00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:06,499
before

00:28:02,809 --> 00:28:10,100
and most importantly after doing this

00:28:06,499 --> 00:28:12,980
research these are kind of note

00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:16,519
assumptions you know we have the numbers

00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:19,759
there we have we know the what actually

00:28:16,519 --> 00:28:22,639
do users are searching for it's not that

00:28:19,759 --> 00:28:24,230
we we think okay we have let's say that

00:28:22,639 --> 00:28:25,970
number of heads for this solution so

00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:28,190
people are probably searching that and

00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:33,080
that and that so these are not

00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:36,909
assumptions so I did one created this

00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:40,730
presentation I send it to send it to of

00:28:36,909 --> 00:28:45,429
team members and managers and there was

00:28:40,730 --> 00:28:47,779
some feedback but nothing happened so

00:28:45,429 --> 00:28:49,970
that was kind of like interesting moment

00:28:47,779 --> 00:28:52,190
were one of the colleagues came to me

00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:54,230
and she said well we need to do

00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:56,840
something with that we know right now

00:28:54,230 --> 00:29:00,190
that's well she said we know what the

00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:02,480
users are doing so let's do some change

00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:04,039
because she was already tired of you

00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:06,169
know being there 15 years and nothing

00:29:04,039 --> 00:29:07,940
changed and she she went she's so like

00:29:06,169 --> 00:29:11,059
this sparkling that something might

00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:12,860
change it and make something usable and

00:29:11,059 --> 00:29:15,559
beautiful and you know something that

00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:17,690
will work i shape for the user so we

00:29:15,559 --> 00:29:20,059
pushed the change below the rudder and

00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:23,779
that means that we didn't go through

00:29:20,059 --> 00:29:25,999
this whole process where we had to have

00:29:23,779 --> 00:29:28,999
liked it you know design sign-off from

00:29:25,999 --> 00:29:32,600
for managers or three managers and going

00:29:28,999 --> 00:29:35,330
through all these kind of calls and and

00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:38,389
meetings which would be another 50 hours

00:29:35,330 --> 00:29:41,509
or maybe more and we deliver just this

00:29:38,389 --> 00:29:44,119
thing and of course there was like loads

00:29:41,509 --> 00:29:47,840
of blame on our head and a lot of

00:29:44,119 --> 00:29:50,779
problems and because we we didn't really

00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:53,389
go by the rules but I think that was the

00:29:50,779 --> 00:29:58,610
best thing I did in in the bank so far

00:29:53,389 --> 00:29:59,899
and the three weeks after I published a

00:29:58,610 --> 00:30:03,049
paper with all the learnings and

00:29:59,899 --> 00:30:05,539
findings which was which I will go

00:30:03,049 --> 00:30:07,369
through you don't have to read all the

00:30:05,539 --> 00:30:08,960
stuff there it's just like a kind of

00:30:07,369 --> 00:30:11,720
like a template if you like to take the

00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:15,980
slides afterwards you can see how it was

00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:16,760
structured so basically I created

00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:19,220
lightest

00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:22,130
what was before so the initial version

00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:24,770
and then the reason why the search why

00:30:22,130 --> 00:30:27,170
this research has been created or you

00:30:24,770 --> 00:30:30,620
know why I started this research so you

00:30:27,170 --> 00:30:32,510
can see as well the old version this is

00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:36,200
actually the new version and you can see

00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:37,640
that there I defined like the goals and

00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:39,320
it goes were to increase the visibility

00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:42,290
of the search box to make it more

00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:45,170
prominent that would fix the that it's

00:30:42,290 --> 00:30:47,060
not being used that that often make user

00:30:45,170 --> 00:30:48,910
to type in more than just one word to

00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:51,440
get more relevant search results and

00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:53,780
make user to type even sentences and

00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:55,880
questions and this was achieved like you

00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:59,570
can see this input type which before

00:30:55,880 --> 00:31:01,610
there was just search and afterwards was

00:30:59,570 --> 00:31:04,400
there like I ask a question or enter a

00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:07,070
search term here and there was quite

00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:10,310
interesting feedback from few people

00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:13,540
that they were because this change took

00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:16,700
us about I think two hours or so and

00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:18,440
then people were asking a question oh it

00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:21,260
must have been really hard to make

00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:23,870
something that will talk our language

00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:28,040
and will understand our questions right

00:31:23,870 --> 00:31:29,960
and the only thing we did is that we ask

00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:31,820
the user to ask actually questions

00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:33,740
because all the solutions or most of the

00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:37,040
solutions always have something like how

00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:39,320
do i do something so giving the user the

00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:42,260
option because they didn't realize that

00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:44,060
they can type in a question they can

00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:46,490
type in like how do i change something

00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:48,380
which gives more keywords better results

00:31:46,490 --> 00:31:50,510
so that improved Kyle out with just a

00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:55,250
keyword with just a copywriting there

00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:59,660
and we also changed the search button to

00:31:55,250 --> 00:32:01,850
be more prominent and so I described all

00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:03,350
these all these changes in a document I

00:32:01,850 --> 00:32:05,420
also put in like function at the

00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:07,280
development time effort and I wanted to

00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:09,740
show them that it's really possible to

00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:12,710
do something in just like these micro

00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:14,680
researches or micro actions to to just

00:32:12,710 --> 00:32:17,900
push something a little bit harder and

00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:21,680
release more often than just one one

00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:23,890
month release cycles then of course

00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:26,990
follows the learning from the search box

00:32:23,890 --> 00:32:29,120
and then again you need to know like

00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:30,050
what are your goals so search from home

00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:33,320
page it

00:32:30,050 --> 00:32:35,030
increased quite a lot there is the blue

00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:38,210
one is like the previous week the week

00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:40,730
before the change the week after and

00:32:38,210 --> 00:32:44,360
second week after you can see that the

00:32:40,730 --> 00:32:50,600
second week after is already quite above

00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:53,030
the lines I don't even understand right

00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:56,660
now what was the formula because I see

00:32:53,030 --> 00:33:01,340
strange person there probably I got into

00:32:56,660 --> 00:33:03,890
this success driven metrics and so this

00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:06,380
is the search from home page blanky or

00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:10,190
so we thought that it will decrease the

00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:13,150
number but there wasn't a big change in

00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:16,070
that behavior so it needs improving and

00:33:13,150 --> 00:33:17,990
how do I searches that improved a little

00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:22,940
bit so people were actually searching

00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:25,100
more the questions afterwards and there

00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:27,050
as well one of the goals was the single

00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:29,210
keywords and multiple keywords because

00:33:27,050 --> 00:33:30,710
these users before we're typing what's

00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:32,570
if they had a problem with Outlook they

00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:35,600
would type in just outlook that wouldn't

00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:37,610
give them any results so or really

00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:40,310
brought results so we are looking to

00:33:37,610 --> 00:33:43,130
make their users type in multiple

00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:46,880
keywords and that improved a little bit

00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:49,460
but again we can do better and part of

00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:52,250
that was also the proposal due for a new

00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:54,680
version of the box where we learn from

00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:57,190
these statistics we learn from what can

00:33:54,680 --> 00:34:01,730
be improved and be put in some ideas and

00:33:57,190 --> 00:34:03,800
I then propose some sort of like a life

00:34:01,730 --> 00:34:05,660
cycle of the search box of next release

00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:09,620
cycles because we need it or we wanted

00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:11,720
to make it fit into this design process

00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:13,640
that that was there this rigid one and

00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:16,790
we didn't want to go below the rudder

00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:18,950
because they wouldn't allow us and back

00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:21,980
then you have or still I don't care if

00:34:18,950 --> 00:34:28,340
they fire me but the others of course

00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:30,470
they do so then this is the this is the

00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:33,110
life of the of the search box that we

00:34:30,470 --> 00:34:36,860
did and what was really interesting is

00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:39,650
that that I think I'll get to that that

00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:41,850
right after we push this this change

00:34:39,650 --> 00:34:43,290
below the rudder

00:34:41,850 --> 00:34:46,680
everyone was freaking out like the

00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:49,700
managers because they they really wanted

00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:52,680
to make it like a you know like a

00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:54,180
success story and they came to me and

00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:56,580
they never asked whether it's it's

00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:59,070
failing or is there a success they just

00:34:56,580 --> 00:35:01,050
wanted to get the blue numbers and

00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:02,820
that's kind of interesting that why the

00:35:01,050 --> 00:35:06,240
innovation can't happen there because

00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:09,930
everyone expects you that you will be

00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:13,590
always successful and anyways the

00:35:09,930 --> 00:35:16,020
version 1.2 didn't saw the light or

00:35:13,590 --> 00:35:18,990
didn't see the light which is a little

00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:22,430
bit sad but I'm working on another one

00:35:18,990 --> 00:35:25,890
because my contract is ending soon and

00:35:22,430 --> 00:35:27,900
the conclusion is that you shouldn't be

00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:29,790
afraid pushing things forward and for

00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:31,380
example like in the bank it's something

00:35:29,790 --> 00:35:33,420
different and if you have people working

00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:36,630
for you know a company that works there

00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:40,200
like 15 years they have their security

00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:43,320
there but it was nice to see that these

00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:45,840
people as well kind of liked like they

00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:49,890
got into the you know new things and

00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:53,180
they try to try to innovate or try to

00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:55,770
push ideas maybe a little too much

00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:57,570
because they thought that we already

00:35:55,770 --> 00:35:59,280
have some sort of statistics loads of

00:35:57,570 --> 00:36:01,590
statistics but we only had these two

00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:04,410
charts and I thought we'd we have like a

00:36:01,590 --> 00:36:06,720
bee know what the users are doing and

00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:09,930
its really just what i showed it just

00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:11,970
like tip of the iceberg and where you

00:36:09,930 --> 00:36:18,900
have like the one length above and the

00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:20,520
rest is below so if you i'll say you

00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:22,620
should start thinking now about your

00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:24,660
projects and what what can be improved

00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:26,580
there to make the users much more

00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:29,220
happier and as well like to let's say

00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:31,100
drive the business and think about what

00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:34,250
can be measured and define your goals

00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:38,070
deploy it learn it and make a report and

00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:40,650
that means you or try to make it that

00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:42,840
you can fail so you can fail fast and

00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:46,080
fell often and from that you can learn

00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:47,910
it's not good well if you fail it's it's

00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:50,220
fine but if you fell on something that

00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:52,860
you fell before that's not okay so you

00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:54,870
should always kind of iterate and never

00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:55,729
repeat your fails again that's why you

00:36:54,870 --> 00:37:00,719
learn

00:36:55,729 --> 00:37:24,869
and i think that's that's it for me any

00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:27,209
questions yes okay so the question was

00:37:24,869 --> 00:37:30,410
if this was if if doing this research

00:37:27,209 --> 00:37:34,229
was my full-time work during being

00:37:30,410 --> 00:37:36,989
employed her it wasn't i was doing it in

00:37:34,229 --> 00:37:39,539
between of the built regular built work

00:37:36,989 --> 00:37:42,420
so spending let's say like I don't know

00:37:39,539 --> 00:37:45,449
one hour a day just you know analyzing

00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:53,359
the deluxe and stuff but it took it took

00:37:45,449 --> 00:37:56,910
some time yep any other questions yes

00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:59,039
yep I'm working for a bit different

00:37:56,910 --> 00:38:01,499
structure and I working for Drupal shop

00:37:59,039 --> 00:38:04,799
we have clients who pays money we build

00:38:01,499 --> 00:38:07,170
their website and I really like this

00:38:04,799 --> 00:38:09,539
idea and the improvement that we can

00:38:07,170 --> 00:38:13,380
gain from this approach can be really

00:38:09,539 --> 00:38:17,189
huge but in this business when we have

00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:19,739
fixed budgets how we can approach this

00:38:17,189 --> 00:38:22,890
kind of clients when we have smaller

00:38:19,739 --> 00:38:26,969
projects it's not like 15 years and it's

00:38:22,890 --> 00:38:29,249
not huge banks how we can put this into

00:38:26,969 --> 00:38:31,920
the process maybe have some experience

00:38:29,249 --> 00:38:35,400
or maybe smaller scale project right

00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:36,900
well it depends on the what you are

00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:38,849
going to gain from that I mean it's easy

00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:40,499
to to measure that for like e-commerce

00:38:38,849 --> 00:38:42,329
site because you know with e-commerce

00:38:40,499 --> 00:38:46,019
site you always can measure ourselves

00:38:42,329 --> 00:38:48,179
even it's a small project so it depends

00:38:46,019 --> 00:38:49,650
i would say it depends on the goals what

00:38:48,179 --> 00:38:51,479
you can set and what kind of benefit

00:38:49,650 --> 00:38:56,400
that will give you whether it's a verse

00:38:51,479 --> 00:39:00,029
that or not but it's always good there

00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:01,799
you have to sell it as a like doing

00:39:00,029 --> 00:39:03,839
their users research should be really

00:39:01,799 --> 00:39:07,109
part of the of the web designing or at

00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:07,930
least some sort of testing that's the

00:39:07,109 --> 00:39:10,000
problem

00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:12,070
thing is that we don't know and results

00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,930
at all it's not something that is

00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:16,840
predictable especially when you launch

00:39:13,930 --> 00:39:18,820
the website right you cannot say that

00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:20,290
okay we launched this website but in

00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:22,570
half a year we're going to do research

00:39:20,290 --> 00:39:26,650
for one month this will cost this month

00:39:22,570 --> 00:39:28,690
money and we will increase some number

00:39:26,650 --> 00:39:31,300
of visitors or some other metrics for

00:39:28,690 --> 00:39:35,080
this amount if we could say that that

00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:38,230
will be the way go forward but yet we

00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:41,950
fail I mean the aim of research and try

00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:43,780
is to fail at sometimes and we can fail

00:39:41,950 --> 00:39:46,690
five times and on sixth attempt they

00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:49,900
will be way better but we don't know end

00:39:46,690 --> 00:39:53,610
results before we started how we can go

00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:53,610
for them yep

00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:01,260
okay that makes sense

00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:18,229
yep

00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:55,080
no not really ok any other questions ok

00:41:51,570 --> 00:41:56,400
I guess not so thank you and if you have

00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:58,530
any other questions you can come

00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:01,100
directly to me or if you even questions

00:41:58,530 --> 00:42:04,100
