password if you're having trouble

00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:27,450
connecting it's probably because your

00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:29,400

can help it evaluate your sessions this

00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:38,520
is the best way that you can help us

00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:40,080
make the cons better and better so when

00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,710
you finish your sessions your speaker

00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,150
should have

00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:43,950
some instructions about how to do that

00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:45,840
on their slides but you can always go to

00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:48,330
the session pages at any point during

00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:50,100

you I also want to remind everyone that

00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:57,510
it's the community that's the hallmark

00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:59,880
of Drupal right it's it's the

00:06:57,510 --> 00:07:01,260
friendships that we make here and the

00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:03,210

from each other we only have one

00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:06,660
community and we have to take care of it

00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:09,000
and that's why we have a code of conduct

00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:10,770
so I want to remind everyone about the

00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,750
code of conduct invite you to go review

00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:14,670

finally just a huge round of thank yous

00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:30,660
it takes a lot to put one of these on

00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:32,580
the staff the board the volunteers do an

00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:35,400
amazing amount of work you can see

00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:37,380
nobody can read that right we have this

00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:39,600

00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:41,180
our list of thank yous there are so many

00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:43,500
people that are engaged in this process

00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:45,990
to make such a wonderful event come

00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:48,180
together including our sponsors without

00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:50,940
them we would not be able to put on such

00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:53,550
a great event at such a low cost to be

00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:54,300
able to bring all of us together so it's

00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:56,790
their

00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:58,620
in support of this show and the work

00:08:56,790 --> 00:09:01,290
that the DA does it's really important

00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:04,680
for us one thing I do want to point out

00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:06,930
in particular are the drupal association

00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:08,910
and supporting partners these folks make

00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:10,680
a contribution above and beyond what

00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:12,570
they do to support the cons every year

00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:15,240
to help make sure that we can begin to

00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:17,220
find a better drupal org so these are

00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:20,130
the folks that have provided us with

00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:21,660
additional funding and are really

00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:23,070
helping us to start to make the kinds of

00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:25,200
improvements that you want to see on the

00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:26,970
site so thank you to our supporting

00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,399
partners and to our very first

00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:32,040
technology partners folks from outside

00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:33,839
of drupal itself who are really invested

00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:35,820
in making sure that this is a platform

00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:38,660
that works across the web so thank you

00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:41,519
very much to all of those partners and

00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:44,790
with that I keep pressing the wrong way

00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:47,880
and with that I would like to introduce

00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:51,589
to you a very special guest please

00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:51,589
welcome the wound or choir

00:11:09,579 --> 00:11:12,579
little

00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:52,590
wow that was awesome I don't think I've

00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:54,000
ever been introduced like this makes me

00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:58,710
wonder if I should have brought a like a

00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:01,730
rabbit costume or something I was

00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:04,470
awesome thank you I was very very nice

00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:06,570
welcome everybody welcome to drupalcon a

00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:09,690
lost track of how many drupal cons we've

00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:11,280
had so far but this is definitely going

00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:13,170
to be the biggest one in Europe and so

00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:16,770
that it's obviously very very exciting

00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:23,730
for us so let's talk a little bit by

00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:27,270
drupal you know why you know why are we

00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:31,560
here and you know why do we do what we

00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:33,750
do and I was thinking about that the

00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:35,600
other day and I think it's worth

00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:39,270
stopping for a moment to talk about that

00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:43,110
so effectively what is our purpose as

00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:45,000
Drupal is it that we work you know we

00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:48,120
make money and we take care of our

00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:53,460
families I think for a lot of us that's

00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:55,640
true but is there more you know is there

00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:59,270
more and I think the answer is yes I

00:12:55,640 --> 00:13:03,330
think there's a lot more to what we do

00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:06,210
in fact I believe you know we're

00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:08,790
changing the world I think we are

00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:12,000
changing the world and I for one I want

00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:14,790
to make a difference I think we're an

00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,380
incredibly powerful movement that have

00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:19,170
been doing some incredible things all

00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:21,420
around the world if you think about the

00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:23,610
change that we have enabled you know

00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:27,540
we've enabled so many others all right

00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:29,790
in the world to do what they do to

00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:31,530
better fulfill their mission whether

00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:34,050
it's helping others whether it's you

00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:36,900
know helping the governor government's

00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:40,080
run better very so much that we do and

00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:42,390
so we help I think I feel like we help

00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:43,379
individuals build a dream you know

00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:47,579
whether that dream

00:13:43,379 --> 00:13:49,259
is having your own drupal shop which i

00:13:47,579 --> 00:13:51,899
think is true for many of you or whether

00:13:49,259 --> 00:13:55,859
that dream is doing a start-up and

00:13:51,899 --> 00:13:59,579
bootstrapping an idea you know we help

00:13:55,859 --> 00:14:01,759
you know people realize these dreams you

00:13:59,579 --> 00:14:04,379
know we give them the tools to do so and

00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:07,949
another thing that we do is we give

00:14:04,379 --> 00:14:11,249
small organizations a big voice now

00:14:07,949 --> 00:14:14,309
that's a really important one for me the

00:14:11,249 --> 00:14:16,349
web is getting more and more complex you

00:14:14,309 --> 00:14:17,989
know organizations do need to do more

00:14:16,349 --> 00:14:21,479
and more with their websites and

00:14:17,989 --> 00:14:23,729
traditionally the tools that people use

00:14:21,479 --> 00:14:25,289
to really you know bring the core of

00:14:23,729 --> 00:14:27,209
their business online or to do these

00:14:25,289 --> 00:14:31,079
things online have only been accessible

00:14:27,209 --> 00:14:33,239
to the larger organizations you know and

00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:34,649
what we've done is we've democratized a

00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:37,439
lot of these tools and we've brought

00:14:34,649 --> 00:14:39,929
them to everyone I know everybody in

00:14:37,439 --> 00:14:43,199
this room and everybody out there in the

00:14:39,929 --> 00:14:46,109
world you know they can use you know

00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:48,629
great technology and you know so we give

00:14:46,109 --> 00:14:50,759
small organizations a big voice but we

00:14:48,629 --> 00:14:53,039
also work a lot with large organizations

00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:55,799
and have their own problems but you know

00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:58,409
even for them we're doing a lot of

00:14:55,799 --> 00:15:00,059
things you know open source is

00:14:58,409 --> 00:15:02,399
definitely being embraced by the large

00:15:00,059 --> 00:15:03,989
organizations and they also need to do

00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:07,829
more with less and we give them the

00:15:03,989 --> 00:15:10,769
tools to do so you know we're leading

00:15:07,829 --> 00:15:13,229
some of the most exciting advances in

00:15:10,769 --> 00:15:15,449
technology we're allowing organizations

00:15:13,229 --> 00:15:18,119
to build rich and engaging experiences

00:15:15,449 --> 00:15:20,549
and basically build transformative

00:15:18,119 --> 00:15:23,069
experiences online and that's a big deal

00:15:20,549 --> 00:15:26,039
and also I feel what our communities

00:15:23,069 --> 00:15:27,600
about is that we admit no boundaries you

00:15:26,039 --> 00:15:29,759
know we look at HTML as one way to

00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:32,220
deliver content we look at my school is

00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:33,949
only one database that we support but we

00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:36,239
don't limit ourselves to my squirrel

00:15:33,949 --> 00:15:39,389
same thing with PHP we don't necessarily

00:15:36,239 --> 00:15:41,609
limit ourselves to PHP we've done more

00:15:39,389 --> 00:15:45,089
and more JavaScript and so I've always

00:15:41,609 --> 00:15:46,919
felt and I still feel that today that

00:15:45,089 --> 00:15:49,769
we're about pushing boundaries and a

00:15:46,919 --> 00:15:54,659
Drupal is not just the technology stack

00:15:49,769 --> 00:15:57,329
but it's an idea it's something you know

00:15:54,659 --> 00:16:00,899
that that's way bigger than technology

00:15:57,329 --> 00:16:03,239
and you know we'll do it again you know

00:16:00,899 --> 00:16:05,610
if we've reinvented ourselves many times

00:16:03,239 --> 00:16:08,220
and we're going to reinvent ourselves

00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:10,829
again and that's why I wanted to talk a

00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:13,350
little bit about Drupal 8 because you

00:16:10,829 --> 00:16:16,679
know I do believe that Drupal 8 has the

00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:18,149
opportunity to basically erase all of

00:16:16,679 --> 00:16:20,399
these efforts all of these things that I

00:16:18,149 --> 00:16:21,869
just mentioned to an even higher level

00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:24,749
and so I wanted to talk a little bit

00:16:21,869 --> 00:16:27,420
about that as you probably are well

00:16:24,749 --> 00:16:30,480
aware Drupal 8 is a major evolution of

00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:33,179
Drupal but it's very well aligned with

00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:36,660
with those vision statements that I put

00:16:33,179 --> 00:16:40,019
up and as we worked on Drupal 8 we made

00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:43,170
a plan for Drupal 8 and that plan is

00:16:40,019 --> 00:16:45,360
sort of the six initiatives that we put

00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:46,709
forward I've talked about these quite a

00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,660
bit in the past so I don't want to talk

00:16:46,709 --> 00:16:50,459
about them too much in this keynote but

00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:53,970
i do want to quickly remind people of

00:16:50,459 --> 00:16:55,949
what they are the first one is

00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:57,480
configuration management for those i

00:16:55,949 --> 00:17:00,540
don't know configuration management it's

00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:02,699
a very big deal for everyone that wants

00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:04,490
to better deploy Drupal sites I'm going

00:17:02,699 --> 00:17:06,539
to be able to push content from

00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:09,929
development environments to production

00:17:06,539 --> 00:17:13,380
environments and we free architected how

00:17:09,929 --> 00:17:16,829
we do that in Drupal 8 mobile all the

00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:18,120
way back in 2011 we declared mobile as

00:17:16,829 --> 00:17:19,949
one of the biggest things that we wanted

00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:22,339
to do in Drupal and we've really don't

00:17:19,949 --> 00:17:24,809
so we've spent a lot of time and energy

00:17:22,339 --> 00:17:26,939
in improving mobile features in Drupal

00:17:24,809 --> 00:17:30,990
and so we've embraced responsive we

00:17:26,939 --> 00:17:33,750
adopted html5 we even have a better tool

00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:37,860
bar to allow people to you know faster

00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:39,990
and easier navigate Drupal blocks we've

00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:42,179
done a lot of blocks work on blocks and

00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:44,669
layouts I wish we would have done more

00:17:42,179 --> 00:17:47,159
in this area but I do believe we've put

00:17:44,669 --> 00:17:49,919
the foundations in place and this will

00:17:47,159 --> 00:17:52,500
help help us adopt two important trends

00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:54,899
like personalization targeting which and

00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:57,600
I talked about in Portland for those now

00:17:54,899 --> 00:17:59,240
watch that keynote so a lot of important

00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:02,159
work there as well multilingual

00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:04,260
especially in Europe very important but

00:18:02,159 --> 00:18:05,909
you know we've literally made hundreds

00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:07,529
of improvements to multilingual it's

00:18:05,909 --> 00:18:10,409
hard to talk about what we did because

00:18:07,529 --> 00:18:10,620
there's so many different things but you

00:18:10,409 --> 00:18:12,800
know

00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:17,820
massive improvements arendt multilingual

00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:20,340
views in core you know very big deal

00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:23,400
views was the most popular contribute

00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:25,290
module we've added it to core as we move

00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:28,350
it into core we made it even better and

00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:31,610
we started to integrate it it in core

00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:33,870
itself and it's important because views

00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:36,809
you know changes the way people who

00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:39,480
build websites right it really empowers

00:18:36,809 --> 00:18:41,670
individuals smaller organizations and

00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:44,490
larger organizations to really build

00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:47,130
websites faster and then web services

00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:48,809
was the sixth initiative and that's

00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:51,510
important because you want Drupal to

00:18:48,809 --> 00:18:52,920
integrate with third-party systems but

00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:57,630
also because you want people to build

00:18:52,920 --> 00:19:00,210
native apps on Drupal so we built in our

00:18:57,630 --> 00:19:02,280
native support for web services and so

00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:04,200
these are the six initiatives we've done

00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:07,170
a ton of work on them the past six

00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:10,020
months since Portland but what I really

00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:12,510
wanted to talk about here is some of the

00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:14,040
other features like you know these these

00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:15,330
initiatives get a lot of attention but

00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:17,640
there's a lot of other things we've done

00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:23,970
and I just want to highlight a couple of

00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:25,770
those alright so the first one I wanted

00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:31,500
to talk about is is the accessibility

00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:34,320
work you know what some bugs in Drupal 7

00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:37,080
that basically prevented screen readers

00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:40,140
to really deal with sort of visual stage

00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:42,360
changes when a dialog pops up a model or

00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:44,190
other things happen they couldn't always

00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:46,320
follow along and so there a lot of work

00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:48,210
has been done in Drupal 8 to make that

00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:51,000
better and so have a little video which

00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:53,309
I'll show you now which demonstrates how

00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:58,470
screen readers work and how it works in

00:19:53,309 --> 00:20:01,370
Drupal 8 hello i am drupal 8 and i am

00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:01,370
now self-aware

00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:08,540
content extend content button link comp

00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:11,810
link extend structure button link block

00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:15,890
layout list 10 items level too close

00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:18,290
overlay button visited link quick edit

00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:20,660
list three items quick at a field image

00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:24,890
button quick edit field body button

00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:26,510
editing entity node one feel body so

00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:27,650
very quick video but it shows you some

00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:30,110
of the great things we've done with

00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:33,020
we've added an API to core which allows

00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:35,120
us to control what these readers you

00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:37,250
know talk and how they can move around

00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:39,350
the page and it's a big big improvement

00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:41,210
for many of you it may not matter but it

00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:44,330
matters to those that are visually

00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:53,480
impaired and so I think I think it will

00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:55,520
help us a lot oh well so the other thing

00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:57,200
we've done is we've you know if we've

00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:59,300
worked on scheme at a Doric integration

00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,560
and it's sort of a hidden gem and it's

00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:02,210
something that I'm very passionate about

00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:04,880
as well but for those i don't know

00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:07,280
scheme a Doric it's essentially a

00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:08,800
semantic markup to describe the content

00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:12,230
on your page and here's a quick example

00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:14,240
of you know what you would do in HTML to

00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:15,920
describe an offer something that you're

00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:18,320
selling so you basically you know have

00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:20,990
these properties like name and price and

00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:24,080
you can attack these elements right and

00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:27,020
then in this example there is also like

00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:29,240
a rating a four-star rating or a 5-star

00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:30,950
rating which is based on 25 user reviews

00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:34,310
and even that element you can sort of

00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:37,280
expand I'm also make more semantic so

00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:39,860
you can basically make that of type

00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:41,540
aggregate rating and you can define the

00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:44,090
rating value in the best training and

00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:46,700
how many you know ratings are work and

00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:48,890
that's these kinds of things we've put

00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:50,210
in core as well and that's exciting in

00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:53,390
the short term because it will provide

00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:55,010
better search engine optimization so if

00:21:53,390 --> 00:21:57,020
you look at Google results you can see

00:21:55,010 --> 00:21:59,950
that they're doing these rich results

00:21:57,020 --> 00:22:02,480
which you know helps people or helps

00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:05,080
websites to drive more traffic and so in

00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:07,540
the case I try to look for like a

00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:09,830
blender romantic or whatever it was

00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:12,140
couldn't find one but I find a peeler

00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:14,000
and you can see how Google renders it

00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:16,700
here it shows you the rating

00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:19,940
you the price but there's a lot of these

00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:22,250
kind of schemas if you will and so you

00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:24,560
have them for music and albums and so it

00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:26,150
lists the songs we also have that for

00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:27,710
recipes and then it's it you know gives

00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:29,210
you things like how long it takes to

00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:31,340
cook the recipe and all of these things

00:22:29,210 --> 00:22:32,900
so and that's exciting for you know

00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:36,830
everybody that cares about search engine

00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:38,180
optimization but the long run what's

00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:41,210
cool about that is that it will actually

00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:42,770
help us evolve the web and actually

00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:44,750
truly fulfill the potential of the

00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:47,180
weapon tim berners-lee the inventor of

00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:49,010
the web set that eventually we will

00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:51,350
evolve from the world wide web to the

00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:52,910
giant global graph so the potential that

00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:55,820
this brings is that the web will become

00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:57,430
a graph and that you know computers will

00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:59,600
start to work like the ones in Star Trek

00:22:57,430 --> 00:23:01,640
you know you ask them a question and

00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:04,220
they give you the answer versus what we

00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:06,620
do today switch we you know research you

00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:09,590
know ten different ways and we extract

00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:11,420
the answer or self and so I think it's a

00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:14,840
great cool thing that we added to Drupal

00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:16,460
core and it will help us um you know it

00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:17,960
will help position us for the future and

00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:20,690
have a little video from one of the

00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:22,280
founders of schema rhetoric that we

00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:24,440
interviewed in a talks about what that

00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:27,910
means for Drupal and the world so I'll

00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:31,850
play that now it's only a minute or so

00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:34,520
many of the major sites like eBay and

00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:37,040
yell and others have started using

00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:38,930
schema.org markup and in our component

00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:41,120
of pages but the thing that's most

00:23:38,930 --> 00:23:43,520
exciting to us is the weather's not just

00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:45,290
about the top 10 or 15 or 20 websites

00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:47,810
the thing that's exciting about the web

00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:50,210
is a variety the richness the hundreds

00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:52,580
of thousands of smaller websites and

00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:55,220
which is what makes us the adoption of

00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:57,320
schema.org by drupal so exciting so

00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:58,640
interesting hopefully we look back at

00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:00,440
the year from now and say a while

00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,720
scimitar we are so big and then one of

00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:03,270
the

00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:07,710
landmarks in that progress will be the

00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:09,330
adoption of schema.org by Kofi it's

00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:11,280
pretty cool hopefully that will allow us

00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:13,740
to be at least a footnote in the history

00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:15,630
of the web but I really think again that

00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:18,840
we can help sort of bring this

00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:20,460
technology to the masses lots of other

00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:23,460
great improvements I want to highlight a

00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:25,320
couple of more the new theme system is a

00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:27,210
very big deal as well and there's a lot

00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:30,990
of sessions about three akhir but if you

00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:34,650
look at Drupal 7 no this is what a

00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:37,620
template page looks like you know you

00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:39,150
see we're printing variables you know

00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:41,220
some things need to be rendered other

00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:43,740
things are already rendered we're

00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:45,419
switching in and out of PHP which you

00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:49,159
know it's okay for developers to do but

00:24:45,419 --> 00:24:51,090
for a lot of people it is um you know

00:24:49,159 --> 00:24:53,340
troublesome in the sense that you can

00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:56,130
make mistakes and get white screens but

00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:57,450
also from a security point of view you

00:24:56,130 --> 00:24:59,400
know there can be risks there if you

00:24:57,450 --> 00:25:02,549
work with people that are not aware of

00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:05,159
sort of the Drupal security api's and so

00:25:02,549 --> 00:25:08,280
in Drupal 8 we we redid all of that we

00:25:05,159 --> 00:25:09,270
using twig basically and it looks a

00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:11,730
little bit like this well it looks

00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:15,299
exactly like this and there is no more

00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:19,440
PHP which is a big deal for many

00:25:15,299 --> 00:25:20,580
designers and you know there is no more

00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,980
rendering like everything is

00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:25,080
pre-rendered and while we're at it we

00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:28,620
also embraced html5 and we we've updated

00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:31,260
our templates to html5 so a lot of work

00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:33,270
went into that and I'll talk a little

00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:36,030
bit more about that in a second as well

00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:39,320
so great great job to the twig theme and

00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:39,320
the html5 d

00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:47,440
we also added a new fields to core and

00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:49,660
what I mean by that is no a cck works

00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:51,310
you know there's different fields and so

00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:52,720
we added more fields to core which gives

00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:55,210
more power to people that want to build

00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:57,340
content types and we've built them you

00:25:55,210 --> 00:25:59,020
know leveraging html5 as well so what

00:25:57,340 --> 00:26:00,850
that means is you know we added the

00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:02,260
daytime field to core which was a

00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:04,090
contribute module and if you implement

00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:07,210
that now and you use it on a mobile

00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:09,670
phone it will actually use sort of the

00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:12,600
native date picker of the device this is

00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:15,070
what it looks like on an iOS device but

00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:17,650
other other phones do the same thing

00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:21,280
same thing with the telephone field

00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:22,990
which we added but you see if you

00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:25,690
declare a telephone field you get sort

00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:29,860
of the America pads instead of you know

00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:34,320
the normal keyboard and then we also

00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:37,120
edit the email field and you know again

00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:39,670
you know most devices will sort of give

00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:42,940
you the right keyboard in this case it

00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:45,670
will have the @ symbol so pretty great

00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:48,580
work variant power and empowering for a

00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:52,060
lot of people the next thing which with

00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:53,890
it is we redesigned the administration

00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:56,590
pages i'm going to give an example of

00:26:53,890 --> 00:26:58,900
the content creation page what it looked

00:26:56,590 --> 00:27:00,610
like in seven some of the issues we saw

00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:04,240
and then what we did about it

00:27:00,610 --> 00:27:06,810
interpolates there's a lot of small

00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:09,100
little things which we didn't like and

00:27:06,810 --> 00:27:10,630
it's actually been a lot of work to get

00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:12,970
all of these little things right then if

00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:15,520
you don't stop and think about it or

00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:18,160
showed in a video like this sometimes it

00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:20,230
gets lost you know how much work we've

00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:22,300
done there and we have a vision there is

00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:25,710
a bunch of patches in the cube we think

00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:25,710
we can even push it more

00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:46,599
and there is many more features and you

00:27:45,309 --> 00:27:48,940
know I hope that I encourage everybody

00:27:46,599 --> 00:27:50,769
to kind of like you know start talking

00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:52,749
about these little gems these little

00:27:50,769 --> 00:27:54,369
things that people like and start

00:27:52,749 --> 00:27:56,859
sharing those because there's a lot

00:27:54,369 --> 00:27:59,440
there so what does all of that mean for

00:27:56,859 --> 00:28:02,559
you you know what's the value for you

00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:05,099
and there's a lot of different users in

00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:08,529
Drupal there is the larger organizations

00:28:05,099 --> 00:28:10,269
there is the smaller organizations or

00:28:08,529 --> 00:28:11,619
the individuals there is you know

00:28:10,269 --> 00:28:13,690
technical people and there is no

00:28:11,619 --> 00:28:15,969
technical people all right and so I want

00:28:13,690 --> 00:28:17,889
to look at a few personas the first

00:28:15,969 --> 00:28:20,559
persona I want to look at is a small

00:28:17,889 --> 00:28:22,719
site owner and I talked to a lot of

00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:24,549
those and you know usually they say

00:28:22,719 --> 00:28:27,070
something like you know it's hard to

00:28:24,549 --> 00:28:30,639
Drupal 7 is really hard and there's no

00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:32,440
WYSIWYG it's really hard to get images

00:28:30,639 --> 00:28:34,839
and you know I want to change the main

00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:37,269
page from just being you know 10 notes

00:28:34,839 --> 00:28:39,999
to something a little bit more powerful

00:28:37,269 --> 00:28:42,729
and so for these users we've actually

00:28:39,999 --> 00:28:44,469
done a lot you know we've added WYSIWYG

00:28:42,729 --> 00:28:46,570
you know a lot of the basic features

00:28:44,469 --> 00:28:48,249
that they want we've installed we've

00:28:46,570 --> 00:28:50,619
added something like the tour module

00:28:48,249 --> 00:28:52,929
which gives them really content in a

00:28:50,619 --> 00:28:55,089
context-sensitive help and sort of walks

00:28:52,929 --> 00:28:58,359
them through you is you know we've never

00:28:55,089 --> 00:28:59,859
done helped this way I think it will you

00:28:58,359 --> 00:29:02,200
know if we do this right and we add more

00:28:59,859 --> 00:29:06,700
tours I think it will really help a lot

00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:08,349
of people we changed the information

00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:10,450
architecture a little bit but mostly

00:29:08,349 --> 00:29:12,639
we've added a new toolbar in that

00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:14,409
toolbar allows people to navigate faster

00:29:12,639 --> 00:29:17,019
you don't need to reload every page as

00:29:14,409 --> 00:29:20,379
you navigate making it easier for people

00:29:17,019 --> 00:29:22,089
to discover things you know we've done

00:29:20,379 --> 00:29:26,529
more drag and drop so you know can I

00:29:22,089 --> 00:29:27,820
start to do work more inline editing is

00:29:26,529 --> 00:29:29,859
something that a lot of these people

00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:32,799
care about they just want to get going

00:29:29,859 --> 00:29:35,229
and create content and then we've even

00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:36,849
worked on installer made that easier

00:29:35,229 --> 00:29:38,259
we've had a great support for

00:29:36,849 --> 00:29:39,909
multilingual for example in the

00:29:38,259 --> 00:29:44,289
Installer making it easier for people to

00:29:39,909 --> 00:29:46,149
install multilingual websites and to me

00:29:44,289 --> 00:29:47,830
this is all of these things are really

00:29:46,149 --> 00:29:49,390
important i think if we

00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:51,820
want to be more successful with these

00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:54,070
organizations I think user experience is

00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:55,510
a big deal and so all of these changes

00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:57,970
that we've made to the user experience

00:29:55,510 --> 00:29:59,950
are great and then things like views

00:29:57,970 --> 00:30:02,230
even make it better because at the end

00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:04,450
of the day most of these people don't

00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:07,149
necessarily want to write code so if we

00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:10,539
can avoid them writing codes we're going

00:30:07,149 --> 00:30:14,370
to make them more successful all right

00:30:10,539 --> 00:30:17,679
another persona is a front-end developer

00:30:14,370 --> 00:30:19,929
you know we've done a lot of work for

00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:22,090
these there's been a lot of feedback

00:30:19,929 --> 00:30:24,279
from these people I want to use more

00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:27,429
modern techniques they want to have less

00:30:24,279 --> 00:30:30,399
you know craft to deal with and

00:30:27,429 --> 00:30:31,929
generally find things too complicated so

00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:35,019
a whole bunch of improvements gone into

00:30:31,929 --> 00:30:36,909
Drupal for these people as well we've

00:30:35,019 --> 00:30:38,679
cleaned up a lot of the markup there's

00:30:36,909 --> 00:30:40,269
been people dedicated to cleaning up

00:30:38,679 --> 00:30:45,909
markup and cleaning it up and cleaning

00:30:40,269 --> 00:30:48,370
it up as mentioned we've adopted html5

00:30:45,909 --> 00:30:51,010
which a lot of them are very excited

00:30:48,370 --> 00:30:53,409
about it we've also introduced more like

00:30:51,010 --> 00:30:55,029
UI patterns things like models and drop

00:30:53,409 --> 00:30:58,059
buttons and things like that that they

00:30:55,029 --> 00:31:01,600
can work with to quickly build more rich

00:30:58,059 --> 00:31:03,820
and powerful user interfaces we've added

00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:05,620
libraries like backbone and underscore

00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:08,980
and you know more importantly we've

00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:12,970
embraced this concept of not inventing

00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:15,159
everything ourselves and so we've made

00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:19,720
everything responsive out of the box and

00:31:15,159 --> 00:31:21,269
as I mentioned we adopt it tweaked so a

00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:23,679
lot of improvements for these people

00:31:21,269 --> 00:31:26,080
then there's also people like marketing

00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:28,600
managers and you know talk to a lot of

00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:30,190
these two and their their biggest

00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:32,620
concern is we will need to publish

00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:35,590
content to multiple channels in multiple

00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:38,710
languages and have a team of people and

00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:40,539
they need to be able to use you know

00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:42,870
Drupal to basically write all of the

00:31:40,539 --> 00:31:44,830
content so completely different

00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:46,570
challenges they want to integrate with

00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:48,580
third-party systems like it's your em

00:31:46,570 --> 00:31:51,429
system or a marketing automation system

00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:53,500
these kinds of things lots of

00:31:51,429 --> 00:31:55,210
improvements for them you know the web

00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:57,580
services support will allow people to

00:31:55,210 --> 00:31:59,470
build native apps all of the

00:31:57,580 --> 00:32:01,690
multilingual improvements are a very big

00:31:59,470 --> 00:32:05,110
deal for these people and their

00:32:01,690 --> 00:32:07,450
James the rest support that we added to

00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:08,529
Drupal core is also very important

00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:11,710
because they do want to do these

00:32:08,529 --> 00:32:12,970
integrations as I mentioned and schema

00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:15,940
rhetoric will actually be very helpful

00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:18,250
for them as well and it's in an area

00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:19,539
where we are thought leaders because it

00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:24,009
will help them with the search engine

00:32:19,539 --> 00:32:27,340
optimization of their sites things like

00:32:24,009 --> 00:32:31,480
responsive preview I believe are very

00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:33,340
important for these people and in all of

00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:36,059
the altering experience improvement that

00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:38,200
we've made will really help them I

00:32:36,059 --> 00:32:39,759
believe this is a big audience for us

00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:42,909
because there is a big shift happening

00:32:39,759 --> 00:32:45,399
from in terms of decision making and who

00:32:42,909 --> 00:32:47,559
adopts or would choose that's the CMS

00:32:45,399 --> 00:32:50,350
technology used to be the IT

00:32:47,559 --> 00:32:52,299
organization increasingly more it's a

00:32:50,350 --> 00:32:55,690
CMO the chief marketing officer or the

00:32:52,299 --> 00:32:57,879
marketing organization and you know

00:32:55,690 --> 00:32:59,769
making sure that we you know make

00:32:57,879 --> 00:33:02,110
improvements for these people is also

00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:05,289
really important and I believe we've

00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:06,730
done that with Drupal 8 the last person

00:33:05,289 --> 00:33:09,490
I want to talk about is the engineering

00:33:06,730 --> 00:33:12,870
director also a technical person in

00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:16,210
typically larger organizations they have

00:33:12,870 --> 00:33:18,669
kinds of different pain points they

00:33:16,210 --> 00:33:20,740
usually complain by things like my team

00:33:18,669 --> 00:33:24,580
needs tribal knowledge about Drupal it's

00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:27,580
hard to get you know Drupal talents they

00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:31,149
struggle with content staging they

00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:33,460
struggle with you know deployment of

00:33:31,149 --> 00:33:36,759
Drupal usually they have a lot of Drupal

00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:38,230
sites and they need to you know maintain

00:33:36,759 --> 00:33:41,769
all of these websites so they definitely

00:33:38,230 --> 00:33:44,500
need to do more with less and then of

00:33:41,769 --> 00:33:47,590
course security and scalability are also

00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:50,559
big concerns there so things like things

00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:52,600
we've done for them is we've done

00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:55,090
configuration management configuration

00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:59,649
is stored in files making deployment

00:33:55,090 --> 00:34:01,690
much easier we've started to adopt a lot

00:33:59,649 --> 00:34:03,789
of other libraries like guzzle who's

00:34:01,690 --> 00:34:05,200
only one example but it's a you know

00:34:03,789 --> 00:34:07,629
it's a it's a good thing because it

00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:09,099
allows us to to go faster and to

00:34:07,629 --> 00:34:12,099
leverage documentation from other

00:34:09,099 --> 00:34:14,360
projects and you know support more edge

00:34:12,099 --> 00:34:18,740
cases and things like that

00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:20,510
we've adopted object-oriented code which

00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:23,450
you know specifically for light large

00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:25,250
websites will be useful or large systems

00:34:23,450 --> 00:34:27,170
I should say and drupal is a large

00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:31,250
system you know makes it more

00:34:27,170 --> 00:34:34,850
maintainable also makes it easier to

00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:38,210
find talent we've adopted Symphony as a

00:34:34,850 --> 00:34:41,600
framework which which is great we've

00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:43,820
done work around scalability like for

00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:47,000
example chicks it on a lot of work it's

00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:51,260
reporting no sequel databases like

00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:53,060
which will help us scale websites some

00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:55,820
of the blocks work that we've done will

00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:57,770
hopefully eventually lead to being able

00:34:55,820 --> 00:35:00,140
to support things like each site

00:34:57,770 --> 00:35:03,590
includes and technologies like that is

00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:04,970
going to scale up websites and then you

00:35:03,590 --> 00:35:07,550
know for testability we've done things

00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:09,620
like PHP units so you know lots and lots

00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:13,130
of improvements and so looking back I

00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:14,990
think I think Drupal 8 will ship with

00:35:13,130 --> 00:35:17,630
lots and lots of great improvements for

00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:19,400
small users and for large users and for

00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:22,850
technical users and for non-technical

00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:24,710
users I know it's one of the goals at

00:35:22,850 --> 00:35:28,160
least for me and I think we really

00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:29,600
really fulfilled that goal so you know

00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:32,060
generally speaking I feel like we've

00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:34,400
really upped our game with Drupal 8

00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:37,850
we've added so many great new features

00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:40,370
and I feel like these features are sort

00:35:37,850 --> 00:35:43,100
of on the money if you will if if I

00:35:40,370 --> 00:35:46,610
think about what we needed to do to keep

00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:48,890
Drupal competitive you know feel like we

00:35:46,610 --> 00:35:52,520
really nailed it and in fact I wish we

00:35:48,890 --> 00:35:54,290
had done a little bit more but I feel

00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:57,700
really good about sort of the direction

00:35:54,290 --> 00:36:02,020
that we've taken Drupal in of course

00:35:57,700 --> 00:36:07,100
there is a lot of work left to be done

00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:08,540
and we really need all of your help you

00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:11,000
know there's a lot of you here there's a

00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:13,700
lot of you in the world and we need you

00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:15,860
to help us finish Drupal 8 and there's a

00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:18,380
lot of work left to be done and instead

00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:19,910
of me telling you what we need to do a

00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:22,700
figure i would ask the initiative leads

00:36:19,910 --> 00:36:24,800
the six initiative leads to you know ask

00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:27,930
you to help instead of a little video of

00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:29,760
the six initiative leads telling you

00:36:27,930 --> 00:36:34,860
what they can help with but you can help

Drupal's routing in many systems and

00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:11,070
could use some help from menu experts to

00:37:09,570 --> 00:37:13,080
finalize the improvements to the menu

00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:15,060
systems we could also still use helping

00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:16,860
experience module developers to help

00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:19,740

00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:57,810

00:37:56,370 --> 00:37:59,610
Greg done laughs and I'm believing the

00:37:57,810 --> 00:38:01,920
configuration management initiative I'm

00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:03,840
looking for people to help test cmi in

00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:06,090
real world situations using real-world

00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:09,350
work workflows so if you're great at

00:38:06,090 --> 00:38:11,280
breaking things I'd love your help

00:38:09,350 --> 00:38:13,520
alright well let's give it up for these

00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,520
people

00:38:18,310 --> 00:38:21,950
I've done a tremendous work leading

00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:24,320
these initiatives and I've given a lot

00:38:21,950 --> 00:38:26,300
I've given up a lot of their personal

00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:28,250
time frankly in nights and weekends to

00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:30,440
to Shepherd these things forwards and

00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:32,869
they need they need a lot of help you

00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:35,060
know and everybody can help you know

00:38:32,869 --> 00:38:36,890
whether it's as a front-end developer

00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:39,380
back-end developer writing documentation

00:38:36,890 --> 00:38:42,920
or just testing there's many ways to get

00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:46,850
involved a drupalcon is a great way to

00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:49,340
get involved as far as I'm concerned and

00:38:46,850 --> 00:38:52,430
I think there's three my three biggest

00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:56,660
reduce basically are the following one

00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:58,820
we need to make Drupal 8 faster we're

00:38:56,660 --> 00:39:02,030
well aware of that we've purposely left

00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:04,640
a lot of backwards compatibility layers

00:39:02,030 --> 00:39:07,190
in place so we can trance you know move

00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:08,720
from one API to another once these api

00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:11,480
conversions are done we're going to

00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:14,660
remove these layers and we're going to

00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:17,150
be able to focus on on performance which

00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:18,230
we haven't really done yet to date we

00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:20,660
know we have a lot of work in that area

00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:24,680
and I feel pretty confident that we can

00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:29,510
get to the great performance we need to

00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:32,030
fix the developer experience it's also

00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:35,420
been very clear it's also something that

00:39:32,030 --> 00:39:38,810
we you know have been aware of we need

00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:41,330
to simplify our AP ice we need to make

00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:42,410
some of our code less verbose and so one

00:39:41,330 --> 00:39:44,930
of the things you want to do is you want

00:39:42,410 --> 00:39:47,510
to look at a module in Drupal 7 compare

00:39:44,930 --> 00:39:49,520
that with a module in Drupal 8 and sort

00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:51,500
of see where we can simplify things and

00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:53,450
then a lot of that is also writing

00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:56,450
documentation and you know getting

00:39:53,450 --> 00:39:59,450
people to learn about all of the changes

00:39:56,450 --> 00:40:00,770
in Drupal 8 them and helping them to

00:39:59,450 --> 00:40:03,220
come along and that's also something

00:40:00,770 --> 00:40:06,619
that will have to do a lot of work on

00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:09,050
and a third thing is now we need to

00:40:06,619 --> 00:40:11,450
simplify the upgrade pads well first of

00:40:09,050 --> 00:40:15,050
all we need to fix the upgrade pad and

00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:16,760
then in a right documentation and you

00:40:15,050 --> 00:40:19,220
know build tools like code or module

00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:22,280
that will help you know people upside

00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:25,670
upgrade their websites so where are we

00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:28,130
in the release cycle now we've been

00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:31,220
working on Drupal for for a long time

00:40:28,130 --> 00:40:33,869
in Portland we basically moved sort of

00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:37,020
we started doing alphas and we shifted

00:40:33,869 --> 00:40:39,359
focus to cleaning up ap ice and we asked

00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:41,790
module developers to give us feedback on

00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:44,280
these api so we can you know make them

00:40:41,790 --> 00:40:48,060
better or easier whatever is wrong with

00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:50,250
them and basically here we are today in

00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:52,320
Prague we're basically going to keep

00:40:50,250 --> 00:40:53,700
doing the exact same thing you know

00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:56,310
we're going to keep working on cleaning

00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:58,589
up ap ice and we're going to keep

00:40:56,310 --> 00:41:03,420
encouraging people to help us make those

00:40:58,589 --> 00:41:05,250
API is better at some point and I think

00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:07,830
at this stage it's going to be early

00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:11,580
next year we're going to switch to

00:41:07,830 --> 00:41:13,830
focusing on release critical box and

00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:15,839
blockers and that would be a good time

00:41:13,830 --> 00:41:18,359
for people to actually upgrade your

00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:21,859
modules or your themes like if you start

00:41:18,359 --> 00:41:25,200
upgrading today we will not guarantee

00:41:21,859 --> 00:41:27,030
that these modules won't break so but we

00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:29,160
do want you to help but if you don't

00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:31,410
want to chase hat don't start upgrading

00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:36,089
today just yet because we are going to

00:41:31,410 --> 00:41:37,680
make more changes and then you know

00:41:36,089 --> 00:41:43,260
we'll release Drupal 8 when it's ready

00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:46,830
when we fix the critical bugs so so

00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:49,410
basically what that means is there is

00:41:46,830 --> 00:41:53,220
still time to get involved is still time

00:41:49,410 --> 00:41:55,890
to make things better and you know I

00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:58,050
promise you will make the time to get it

00:41:55,890 --> 00:42:00,450
right all right I think we've always

00:41:58,050 --> 00:42:02,849
done that for Drupal and we will

00:42:00,450 --> 00:42:06,960
continue to do so there is no point in

00:42:02,849 --> 00:42:08,520
releasing something that isn't ready so

00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:10,680
assuming we've done all of these things

00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:14,580
and we've released Drupal when it's

00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:16,680
ready I think we you know we also have

00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:19,580
two upper game relative to the Drupal 8

00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:23,070
launch if you look back in history

00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:25,859
Drupal 6 the way we launched Drupal 6

00:42:23,070 --> 00:42:31,050
you basically wrote a blog post is that

00:42:25,859 --> 00:42:33,150
here it is in Drupal 7 I think we

00:42:31,050 --> 00:42:37,619
created a landing page and we had 300

00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:40,380
parties it was way better but we can do

00:42:37,619 --> 00:42:41,580
even better right and I think this is

00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:44,010
all about upping our game

00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:47,040
so one of the first things we did is as

00:42:44,010 --> 00:42:51,510
the drupal association we hired Joe Joe

00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:53,760
sailor is a marketing person and one of

00:42:51,510 --> 00:42:56,940
the first thing Joe did is he helped

00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:58,380
create kind of a new visual treatment

00:42:56,940 --> 00:43:01,890
for Drupal 8 something that we can use

00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:04,260
in launch materials to tie things

00:43:01,890 --> 00:43:06,150
together visually and like in a quick

00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:08,100
examples is we could use it like this or

00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:10,530
you could even use it in things like the

00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:12,780
Installer what I like about it is that

00:43:10,530 --> 00:43:15,720
it keeps or do you know the Drupal econ

00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:18,570
there yet it also provides a visual

00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:22,310
reference to Drupal 8 so just an idea of

00:43:18,570 --> 00:43:25,170
what it could be more importantly Joe

00:43:22,310 --> 00:43:26,190
has been working on a launch plan and

00:43:25,170 --> 00:43:29,760
I'm not going to show you the entire

00:43:26,190 --> 00:43:31,080
launch plan but the idea is that we're

00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:33,600
going to structure this and we're going

00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:36,090
to run this as a project and we're going

00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:37,710
to make materials like overview videos

00:43:36,090 --> 00:43:39,860
and presentations but also training

00:43:37,710 --> 00:43:41,940
materials because a lot of you need to

00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:44,250
you know learn about all of the things

00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:48,000
that changed in Drupal 8 all the way to

00:43:44,250 --> 00:43:50,100
providing sales guidance to the Drupal

00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:52,710
shops so you can you know sell Drupal 8

00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:54,300
your customers very important for us as

00:43:52,710 --> 00:43:57,600
a drupal association is to engage with

00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:58,770
the community and so we want to help we

00:43:57,600 --> 00:44:02,070
want to get help and work together

00:43:58,770 --> 00:44:03,900
because Joe is only one person and it's

00:44:02,070 --> 00:44:07,140
definitely more work than one person can

00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:09,510
do and so you want to provide assets so

00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:10,830
you can promote rupal locally we want to

00:44:09,510 --> 00:44:12,750
work with the local communities to

00:44:10,830 --> 00:44:14,730
translate materials into multiple

00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:19,290
languages and basically do an amazing

00:44:14,730 --> 00:44:21,300
job launching Drupal because and I feel

00:44:19,290 --> 00:44:23,280
like we've worked so hard on Drupal 8

00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:26,610
we've worked so hard with so many people

00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:29,040
for three years and we need to tell the

00:44:26,610 --> 00:44:30,510
world what in all of the great things

00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:32,430
we've done and we should be proud of

00:44:30,510 --> 00:44:34,710
that and we should shout out of the

00:44:32,430 --> 00:44:37,770
roofs and I think it's a very good

00:44:34,710 --> 00:44:40,740
opportunity because there is only so

00:44:37,770 --> 00:44:42,780
many Drupal launches you know every

00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:45,870
three or four years and so it's really

00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:48,690
an opportunity to attract new people to

00:44:45,870 --> 00:44:52,160
Drupal and also to reset people's

00:44:48,690 --> 00:44:55,290
beliefs about Drupal I believe Drupal is

00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:55,780
sometimes has a stigma for example

00:44:55,290 --> 00:44:59,800
around

00:44:55,780 --> 00:45:02,770
the ease of use and I think we've done

00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:05,140
so much work around that that we you

00:45:02,770 --> 00:45:07,060
know we can use a launch event to

00:45:05,140 --> 00:45:10,420
hopefully try and debunk some of these

00:45:07,060 --> 00:45:13,120
myths and to get people to know the real

00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:18,820
Drupal and so I think if we do all of

00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:21,160
this we launched we built a great Drupal

00:45:18,820 --> 00:45:24,100
8 and we'll launch it well I think it

00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:30,520
gets as a step closer to you know

00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:32,320
fulfilling this vision so to date you

00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:35,470
know more than a thousand six hundred

00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:37,000
people actually contributed to Drupal 8

00:45:35,470 --> 00:45:39,340
it's actually more but these are the

00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:41,290
number of people that have a patch in

00:45:39,340 --> 00:45:43,570
Drupal 8 a patch that was accepted so

00:45:41,290 --> 00:45:46,140
it's a very developer II way of looking

00:45:43,570 --> 00:45:50,920
at this but it is an incredible number

00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:54,550
so if you look at Drupal 7 vs Drupal 8

00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:58,480
when we release Drupal 7 just less than

00:45:54,550 --> 00:46:00,910
thousand people I believe contributed to

00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:04,060
Drupal 8 core already you know with

00:46:00,910 --> 00:46:05,320
Drupal 8 alpha 3 we have almost more

00:46:04,060 --> 00:46:08,730
than double the number of people that

00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:08,730
contributed to Drupal 8 so

00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:19,220
that's kind of a remarkable number you

00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:21,410
know and I think that speaks a lot to

00:46:19,220 --> 00:46:23,750
sort of the work that we've been doing

00:46:21,410 --> 00:46:25,700
and you know interestingly if you look

00:46:23,750 --> 00:46:27,980
at the number of new contributors versus

00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:30,830
recurrent contributors you actually see

00:46:27,980 --> 00:46:32,780
that we have more new contributors

00:46:30,830 --> 00:46:35,810
people that had never contributed to

00:46:32,780 --> 00:46:37,520
drupal and a total number of people that

00:46:35,810 --> 00:46:39,800
contributed to drupal 7 so we've been

00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:43,400
very successful in bringing new people

00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:45,770
into core development and we've also

00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:49,640
been very successful in increasing the

00:46:45,770 --> 00:46:51,980
number of recurring contributor so some

00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:55,450
great numbers there and it's hard or

00:46:51,980 --> 00:46:58,520
it's impossible to you know thank a

00:46:55,450 --> 00:47:00,080
thousand six hundred people but I do

00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:01,670
want to highlight a number of people

00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:04,370
because I think they've gone sort of

00:47:01,670 --> 00:47:07,310
above and beyond in helping with Drupal

00:47:04,370 --> 00:47:09,770
8 so I want to talk about a handful of

00:47:07,310 --> 00:47:13,660
people real quick and i'll try to go

00:47:09,770 --> 00:47:18,220
fast but one of the persons that i wanna

00:47:13,660 --> 00:47:18,220
you know thank

00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:25,750
is that it's Kathy she's been a key

00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:27,789
member of the multilingual team she

00:47:25,750 --> 00:47:30,460
first I believe she first became

00:47:27,789 --> 00:47:34,390
involved with Drupal in 2012 so she

00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:36,010
hasn't been around or actually she got

00:47:34,390 --> 00:47:38,140
involved sorry she got involved with

00:47:36,010 --> 00:47:40,960
core in 2012 she's been around longer

00:47:38,140 --> 00:47:42,460
obviously but and one of the things she

00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:45,670
helped do is she helped organize the

00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:47,680
coach prints and now today she's you

00:47:45,670 --> 00:47:49,990
know running the code sprint at Prague

00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:52,210
so if you haven't gone to a coach sprint

00:47:49,990 --> 00:47:54,190
please please come to to the coats

00:47:52,210 --> 00:48:04,480
prints so thank you Cathy for all your

00:47:54,190 --> 00:48:07,420
amazing work alex alex is a remarkable

00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:10,150
story because he quit his full full time

00:48:07,420 --> 00:48:12,720
job and well-paying full-time job to

00:48:10,150 --> 00:48:16,720
dedicate all of his time to Drupal and

00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:19,299
his newborn son Jack as well and you

00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:21,309
know alex has just been amazing I think

00:48:19,299 --> 00:48:23,619
he's been committing more than 50

00:48:21,309 --> 00:48:26,950
patches a week on average this has been

00:48:23,619 --> 00:48:29,890
an absolute machine and I think also two

00:48:26,950 --> 00:48:32,819
dates his birthday is that right so

00:48:29,890 --> 00:48:32,819
happy birthday

00:48:36,910 --> 00:48:43,849
but thank you Alex for you know you know

00:48:40,730 --> 00:48:48,609
surprising us all I think your level of

00:48:43,849 --> 00:48:52,010
commitment I want to thank Jesse beach

out and maintaining a test to forest

00:49:55,339 --> 00:49:59,450

00:50:07,570 --> 00:50:14,890
relatively new to drupal and drupal 8

00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:16,450
she kinda appeared out of the blue and

00:50:14,890 --> 00:50:18,130
you know she's been really helping the

00:50:16,450 --> 00:50:20,200
initiative leads with project management

00:50:18,130 --> 00:50:24,670
and sort of helping the manager projects

00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:26,590
and then also she started to train our

00:50:24,670 --> 00:50:28,870
project manage I guess other project

00:50:26,590 --> 00:50:31,750
managers which has been very helpful

00:50:28,870 --> 00:50:38,650
instead of running Drupal 8 so thank you

00:50:31,750 --> 00:50:40,600
shannon grapple more you know scott also

00:50:38,650 --> 00:50:45,670
only been around two and a half years in

00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:48,070
drupal has been an incredible help you

00:50:45,670 --> 00:50:50,020
know relative to the theme system has

00:50:48,070 --> 00:50:54,010
really you know don't a lot of work

00:50:50,020 --> 00:50:55,720
around the area of tweak but also markup

00:50:54,010 --> 00:50:57,640
reviews and these kinds of things and

00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:59,260
has also been a great mentor for many

00:50:57,640 --> 00:51:00,610
others and so i think that's one of

00:50:59,260 --> 00:51:02,950
these things that we look for people

00:51:00,610 --> 00:51:04,560
that get in help but then also start

00:51:02,950 --> 00:51:07,560
mentoring other people so thank you

00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:07,560
Scott

couple more Tim Plunkett the machine has

00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:20,510
been around for a while but he came out

00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:22,760
of the views world and again I got

00:51:20,510 --> 00:51:25,010
involved with Drupal core when we

00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:27,020
decided to move use into core and I

00:51:25,010 --> 00:51:28,849
think he's probably single-handedly

00:51:27,020 --> 00:51:31,880
responsible for five percent of all of

00:51:28,849 --> 00:51:34,730
the patches that are going into Drupal 8

00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:37,040
and he has worked on all areas of Drupal

00:51:34,730 --> 00:51:39,410
you know from the plug-in system to the

00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:42,200
configuration system to obviously views

00:51:39,410 --> 00:51:52,609
in corso awesome guy buy him a beer

00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:54,500

we ask a lot from these people that I

00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:13,480
show it but from many other people that

00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:16,150
I didn't talk about and it's easy for me

00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:20,290
to show slides we're changing the world

00:56:16,150 --> 00:56:22,420

00:56:20,290 --> 00:56:24,630
know volitans wish week we do and how we

00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:26,920
can democratize tools and how we can

00:56:24,630 --> 00:56:28,630
enable people to build our dreams but

00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:30,700
it's these people you know it's a

00:56:28,630 --> 00:56:33,339
thousand six hundred people the help

00:56:30,700 --> 00:56:36,040
don't ripple quartet did the actual work

00:56:33,339 --> 00:56:40,569
you know so thank you for these people

00:56:36,040 --> 00:56:42,700
and it you know sometimes getting a

00:56:40,569 --> 00:56:45,430
release out isn't going in a straight

00:56:42,700 --> 00:56:49,150
line you know it's not always easy um

00:56:45,430 --> 00:56:51,880
but when it's not i think you know i

00:56:49,150 --> 00:56:54,609
kinda realize that um I'm probably the

00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:57,210
luckiest person in the sense that I get

00:56:54,609 --> 00:57:00,040
to work with so many passionate people

00:56:57,210 --> 00:57:02,740
and I you know I think that's one of the

00:57:00,040 --> 00:57:04,690
best things about what I do and so with

00:57:02,740 --> 00:57:07,839
that I wanna you know basically give all

00:57:04,690 --> 00:57:10,119
of you a high five do I can do that in

00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:13,420
person I want to do a virtual one so I

00:57:10,119 --> 00:57:16,690
came up with this thing basically placed

00:57:13,420 --> 00:57:19,780
your hand there when you give people a

00:57:16,690 --> 00:57:22,829
high five thank you all and I think I'm

00:57:19,780 --> 00:57:22,829
going to answer some questions

00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:39,830
okay please yeah Dunkey well I should

00:57:35,930 --> 00:57:41,510
leave um I've been sitting in the back

00:57:39,830 --> 00:57:43,610
with Paul Johnson you guys have been

00:57:41,510 --> 00:57:45,470
tweeting questions like crazy met a

00:57:43,610 --> 00:57:47,180
whole bunch coming in fortunately many

00:57:45,470 --> 00:57:48,560
of the questions were going in similar

00:57:47,180 --> 00:57:51,620
directions so we distilled it down to

00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:56,990
about five questions some areas that

00:57:51,620 --> 00:57:58,100
we're touching up on okay to begin with

00:57:56,990 --> 00:57:59,890
something that's important that also

00:57:58,100 --> 00:58:04,310
came up when d7 was about to be released

00:57:59,890 --> 00:58:06,950
very simple very important question will

00:58:04,310 --> 00:58:10,430
we be able to nicely migrated from t-72

00:58:06,950 --> 00:58:12,140
d8 right so you know migrations have

00:58:10,430 --> 00:58:14,060
always been a little harder in Drupal

00:58:12,140 --> 00:58:19,130
compared to other systems it's not going

00:58:14,060 --> 00:58:21,620
to change you know we have made a lot of

00:58:19,130 --> 00:58:22,940
big changes to Drupal 8 and I think

00:58:21,620 --> 00:58:26,300
we've made them for all the right

00:58:22,940 --> 00:58:28,220
reasons but the result is that no

00:58:26,300 --> 00:58:31,640
modules will have to be upgraded to use

00:58:28,220 --> 00:58:33,260
new AP ice that's going to be you know

00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:37,310
I'll be honest about that that's going

00:58:33,260 --> 00:58:38,330
to be you know a lot of work but there

00:58:37,310 --> 00:58:42,820
is definitely a lot of things that

00:58:38,330 --> 00:58:46,570
people can do to make migration easier

00:58:42,820 --> 00:58:49,070
in a stick to the well-known modules

00:58:46,570 --> 00:58:51,350
stick to the best practices in Drupal

00:58:49,070 --> 00:58:55,040
like don't hike or if you do all of

00:58:51,350 --> 00:58:58,760
these things you know it could be fairly

00:58:55,040 --> 00:59:00,170
easy you know to upgrade but you know if

00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:02,150
you have custom modules if you have

00:59:00,170 --> 00:59:04,160
custom themes which you know most people

00:59:02,150 --> 00:59:07,580
have custom themes these will have to be

00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:10,940
upgraded so I think the thing you know

00:59:07,580 --> 00:59:12,170
we're committed to innovation and you

00:59:10,940 --> 00:59:13,790
know I think we wanted to make sure

00:59:12,170 --> 00:59:16,400
Drupal is in a good spot but we're also

00:59:13,790 --> 00:59:19,520
committed to making a migration path as

00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:21,350
easy as we can and so you know we will

00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:23,170
do a lot of documentation we will right

00:59:21,350 --> 00:59:26,080
tools and all of these things to help

00:59:23,170 --> 00:59:28,910
all of these people migrate okay cool

00:59:26,080 --> 00:59:31,040
then there's this hot hot potato going

00:59:28,910 --> 00:59:34,640
around which probably has an interesting

00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:38,410
flavor what can we the Drupal community

00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:40,450
learn from backdrop mocha

00:59:38,410 --> 00:59:44,890
so you haven't spoken publicly about

00:59:40,450 --> 00:59:46,809
backdrop you know I you know it's a

00:59:44,890 --> 00:59:48,369
couple of things there i guess that i

00:59:46,809 --> 00:59:51,549
want to say i want to be careful the way

00:59:48,369 --> 00:59:55,450
i see it as well but obviously forks are

00:59:51,549 --> 00:59:58,180
a fundamental part of open source it's a

00:59:55,450 --> 01:00:00,849
right and a freedom to fork and a lot of

00:59:58,180 --> 01:00:02,740
forex are great in a sense that they

01:00:00,849 --> 01:00:04,990
allow and encourage collaboration you

01:00:02,740 --> 01:00:10,030
know press flow is a great example that

01:00:04,990 --> 01:00:13,480
all 4 X are collaborative in nature and

01:00:10,030 --> 01:00:16,329
that's fine too you know sometimes there

01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:19,240
is philosophical differences and then

01:00:16,329 --> 01:00:22,690
sometimes it's the best solution to

01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:25,359
split the community or to fork the

01:00:22,690 --> 01:00:27,940
community I don't I don't like that and

01:00:25,359 --> 01:00:31,599
I think what we should do is we should

01:00:27,940 --> 01:00:32,920
continue to listen and talk and see you

01:00:31,599 --> 01:00:36,369
know what we figure out what we can

01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:38,170
learn but also you know reach out to me

01:00:36,369 --> 01:00:42,430
of course I drop and see if there's ways

01:00:38,170 --> 01:00:44,920
that we can pull them back in and I

01:00:42,430 --> 01:00:47,849
haven't spoken up about it yet because I

01:00:44,920 --> 01:00:50,170
think it is a bit of a process it takes

01:00:47,849 --> 01:00:53,079
conversations and it takes time to work

01:00:50,170 --> 01:00:55,900
out what exactly is going on and usually

01:00:53,079 --> 01:00:58,260
it starts very emotional and over time I

01:00:55,900 --> 01:01:00,940
quit many things in life I guess

01:00:58,260 --> 01:01:02,770
emotions start to disappear and there is

01:01:00,940 --> 01:01:06,309
more room for for ration you know

01:01:02,770 --> 01:01:08,770
rational thinking and so that's why I've

01:01:06,309 --> 01:01:11,589
basically decided to like sit back and

01:01:08,770 --> 01:01:15,430
wait a little bit but I'm not afraid of

01:01:11,589 --> 01:01:17,260
the conversation and I hope that you

01:01:15,430 --> 01:01:19,750
know we hope we can you know bring them

01:01:17,260 --> 01:01:21,849
back into our community if that's not

01:01:19,750 --> 01:01:23,289
the case that you know at the end of the

01:01:21,849 --> 01:01:26,950
day that that's fine too and may

01:01:23,289 --> 01:01:30,460
actually be better instead of having you

01:01:26,950 --> 01:01:32,140
know a disagreement you know and if

01:01:30,460 --> 01:01:35,049
that's the case I the only thing I can

01:01:32,140 --> 01:01:37,480
hope for is that sort of that breakup is

01:01:35,049 --> 01:01:40,000
honorable and that we don't like start

01:01:37,480 --> 01:01:45,670
like you know fighting and that kind of

01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:47,289
stuff but there's a lot of things going

01:01:45,670 --> 01:01:50,049
on and I think we're already committed

01:01:47,289 --> 01:01:51,210
to a number of things like you know the

01:01:50,049 --> 01:01:54,390
switch to to get

01:01:51,210 --> 01:01:56,220
up you know we've been talking about you

01:01:54,390 --> 01:01:58,740
know possibly migrating to github so as

01:01:56,220 --> 01:02:00,210
a drupal association we're kind of

01:01:58,740 --> 01:02:02,010
studying right now we're doing sort of

01:02:00,210 --> 01:02:03,690
an audit of what would be best but it's

01:02:02,010 --> 01:02:06,810
a little bit more complicated than it

01:02:03,690 --> 01:02:09,119
looks because our packaging tools do a

01:02:06,810 --> 01:02:11,490
lot of things you know they package the

01:02:09,119 --> 01:02:14,490
software and so these things how do we

01:02:11,490 --> 01:02:15,660
get that in a get world the issue queue

01:02:14,490 --> 01:02:18,990
is work a little bit different and

01:02:15,660 --> 01:02:20,820
aren't necessarily optimized for for

01:02:18,990 --> 01:02:22,980
what we do and so we need to we need to

01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:25,920
study get up and make a thoughtful

01:02:22,980 --> 01:02:29,839
decision there you know we're committed

01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:32,040
to improving the developer experience

01:02:29,839 --> 01:02:34,080
but at the end of the day also believe

01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:35,130
we need to you know technology we need

01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:36,990
to move forward the web is changing

01:02:35,130 --> 01:02:40,349
rapidly and I don't want Drupal to be in

01:02:36,990 --> 01:02:43,920
a position where we can't you know where

01:02:40,349 --> 01:02:45,750
we can't compete if you will so it's

01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:48,690
always a very difficult balance in terms

01:02:45,750 --> 01:02:51,089
of how how hard do you want to push you

01:02:48,690 --> 01:02:53,640
know because you need to push hard

01:02:51,089 --> 01:02:55,230
enough to keep up with with the pace of

01:02:53,640 --> 01:02:57,300
innovation but if you push too hard

01:02:55,230 --> 01:03:01,349
sometimes it's also not a good thing and

01:02:57,300 --> 01:03:03,330
so it's difficult but I think you know I

01:03:01,349 --> 01:03:05,550
think will will will get through it and

01:03:03,330 --> 01:03:07,109
things will be fine last thing I want to

01:03:05,550 --> 01:03:09,330
say on that topic is that I feel very

01:03:07,109 --> 01:03:12,780
confident about Drupal 8 I really

01:03:09,330 --> 01:03:14,940
believe that it is the right you know

01:03:12,780 --> 01:03:16,619
it's going to be great release which is

01:03:14,940 --> 01:03:19,619
not to say we can't learn anything from

01:03:16,619 --> 01:03:21,480
others sorry right your response

01:03:19,619 --> 01:03:25,500
actually hooks into the nice to the next

01:03:21,480 --> 01:03:27,480
question a lot of people we're asking

01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:30,089
since d8 is going to present so many new

01:03:27,480 --> 01:03:33,300
things you mentioned most of the men in

01:03:30,089 --> 01:03:37,050
the in the in the presentation can we

01:03:33,300 --> 01:03:40,430
use Drupal 8 to enter new markets do we

01:03:37,050 --> 01:03:43,260
go beyond websites yeah I think I

01:03:40,430 --> 01:03:45,480
definitely think Drupal 8 is a more

01:03:43,260 --> 01:03:49,130
powerful platform in Drupal 7 but it's

01:03:45,480 --> 01:03:51,089
more easy to be powerful if you will and

01:03:49,130 --> 01:03:53,099
there's a lot of ways to answer your

01:03:51,089 --> 01:03:56,130
question but one way that I've thought

01:03:53,099 --> 01:03:58,800
about it is like we've evolved a little

01:03:56,130 --> 01:04:00,450
bit more to a Content repository instead

01:03:58,800 --> 01:04:03,150
of a system that's just optimized to

01:04:00,450 --> 01:04:04,620
outputting HTML pages right so you can

01:04:03,150 --> 01:04:06,840
put content in and then you can

01:04:04,620 --> 01:04:08,790
content out in different you know

01:04:06,840 --> 01:04:11,220
channels as they say or you know

01:04:08,790 --> 01:04:14,640
multiple formats from HTML to you know

01:04:11,220 --> 01:04:17,910
XML or JSON to you know other devices

01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:21,320
and so that is a big deal and that will

01:04:17,910 --> 01:04:23,790
allow us to do more innovative projects

01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:25,350
that sounds great and then of course a

01:04:23,790 --> 01:04:27,750
follow up on that Drupal has been

01:04:25,350 --> 01:04:30,690
growing quite well in Europe in the

01:04:27,750 --> 01:04:32,280
north in North America other any lessons

01:04:30,690 --> 01:04:34,320
learned from that growth in these

01:04:32,280 --> 01:04:39,180
particular regions for the other regions

01:04:34,320 --> 01:04:41,370
outside Europe outside North America how

01:04:39,180 --> 01:04:44,400
do we do that that's a good question so

01:04:41,370 --> 01:04:49,830
any lessons learned from areas where

01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:52,020
drupal has grown faster I think you know

01:04:49,830 --> 01:04:53,820
if travel to a lot of places and met

01:04:52,020 --> 01:04:58,110
with you know tens of thousands of

01:04:53,820 --> 01:05:01,020
Drupal people and I think what's most

01:04:58,110 --> 01:05:05,090
valuable is our community it's not the

01:05:01,020 --> 01:05:08,370
technology and I've seen I've seen

01:05:05,090 --> 01:05:10,710
amazing local communities in relatively

01:05:08,370 --> 01:05:14,100
small areas because they are really good

01:05:10,710 --> 01:05:16,980
leaders and then other times have been

01:05:14,100 --> 01:05:18,900
amazed when I go to like a big city feel

01:05:16,980 --> 01:05:20,490
and you would expect there to be a large

01:05:18,900 --> 01:05:22,650
community and there isn't no one there

01:05:20,490 --> 01:05:25,500
right i think a lot of that comes down

01:05:22,650 --> 01:05:27,990
to the people like you know strong local

01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:32,850
leaders that build out the local

01:05:27,990 --> 01:05:34,490
communities are so important so you know

01:05:32,850 --> 01:05:38,310
i think that's something that I've seen

01:05:34,490 --> 01:05:40,350
and you know you know we're talking

01:05:38,310 --> 01:05:42,660
about doing serve and actually at in

01:05:40,350 --> 01:05:44,790
Prague here yesterday we had a community

01:05:42,660 --> 01:05:47,760
leadership summit so we're taking steps

01:05:44,790 --> 01:05:50,010
to sort of develop more local leaders or

01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:51,660
two you know develop signs kind of like

01:05:50,010 --> 01:05:53,520
you know funny maybe but to encourage

01:05:51,660 --> 01:05:55,290
like sharing of information and

01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:59,610
knowledge about how you really run a

01:05:55,290 --> 01:06:01,350
successful local community because out

01:05:59,610 --> 01:06:03,420
of that comes a healthy commercial

01:06:01,350 --> 01:06:04,710
ecosystem in that area and you know they

01:06:03,420 --> 01:06:07,590
do events and there isn't you know

01:06:04,710 --> 01:06:09,300
written a lot of it comes into to the

01:06:07,590 --> 01:06:12,930
local people so that I think is

01:06:09,300 --> 01:06:14,340
something that I've learnt so talking

01:06:12,930 --> 01:06:16,620
about the community so expanding the

01:06:14,340 --> 01:06:19,210
community in those areas that are maybe

01:06:16,620 --> 01:06:21,590
new to Drupal

01:06:19,210 --> 01:06:25,130
taking that to the next and the last

01:06:21,590 --> 01:06:27,290
question that I have any plans for a

01:06:25,130 --> 01:06:29,570
Drupal Academy for young people i mean

01:06:27,290 --> 01:06:31,490
last it last year at les con in portland

01:06:29,570 --> 01:06:34,610
we had the 11 year old Galen steel

01:06:31,490 --> 01:06:36,290
attend I mean we need more 11 year olds

01:06:34,610 --> 01:06:39,980
don't we yeah no yeah we'd be good i

01:06:36,290 --> 01:06:42,640
think you know I've always felt like a

01:06:39,980 --> 01:06:45,950
way to measure the success of a project

01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:47,510
it's by sort of and I don't have to be

01:06:45,950 --> 01:06:48,800
careful when I say that it's like you

01:06:47,510 --> 01:06:50,270
know you measured by the number of young

01:06:48,800 --> 01:06:55,250
people that come into the probably a

01:06:50,270 --> 01:06:59,120
project and you know like I'd love to do

01:06:55,250 --> 01:07:01,160
things like an academy I'd love to see

01:06:59,120 --> 01:07:03,740
us develop ways to train more and more

01:07:01,160 --> 01:07:05,390
people and the beauty is that it's

01:07:03,740 --> 01:07:08,150
actually you know high rats and

01:07:05,390 --> 01:07:09,460
education is is in rapid development and

01:07:08,150 --> 01:07:11,690
innovation right now there is a lot of

01:07:09,460 --> 01:07:13,580
programs light you know in the United

01:07:11,690 --> 01:07:16,460
States or is things like ed you know at

01:07:13,580 --> 01:07:18,350
X which is basically online training

01:07:16,460 --> 01:07:22,910
platforms and all of these things and I

01:07:18,350 --> 01:07:24,650
think we may be at a good time in to see

01:07:22,910 --> 01:07:27,050
what we can do their relative to Drupal

01:07:24,650 --> 01:07:29,780
ok because I'd love to see more people

01:07:27,050 --> 01:07:31,820
get involved because I think it's

01:07:29,780 --> 01:07:35,180
healthy for the project I agree with

01:07:31,820 --> 01:07:36,530
that well that wraps up the questions or

01:07:35,180 --> 01:07:37,850
a summary of the questions I think

01:07:36,530 --> 01:07:40,460
there's a thousand questions out there

01:07:37,850 --> 01:07:42,020
and so you'll probably get attacked in a

01:07:40,460 --> 01:07:44,180
few minutes but thank you very much
