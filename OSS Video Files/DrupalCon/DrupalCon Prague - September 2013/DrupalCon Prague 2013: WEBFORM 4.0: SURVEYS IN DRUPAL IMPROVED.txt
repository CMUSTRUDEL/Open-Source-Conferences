well welcome everybody to web form 4.0

00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:10,860
surveys and drupal improved this session

00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:12,990
is going to be all about the web form

00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:15,630
module which I think probably most of

00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:17,000
you guys are already familiar with it's

00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:19,650
sort of one of the oldest

00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,320
longest-running Drupal modules in

00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:26,039
existence that continues to kind of

00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:29,189
upgrade and and be relative relevant in

00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:31,980
each new version of Drupal and the new

00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:34,170
version web form 4 is an iteration on

00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:36,600
the current version of web form that I

00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:39,540
think it will provide a whole bunch of

00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:42,350
new functionality and api's that

00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:45,450
everybody will find useful and powerful

00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:48,360
a little bit about myself my name is

00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:51,629
nate Hogg I'm quick sketch on drupal.org

00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:54,539
and on Twitter and I work for the

00:00:51,629 --> 00:00:56,850
company lalla bots doing development and

00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:59,699
consulting for them and recently I also

00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:02,100
started a company based around the web

00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:05,610
form module called web form comm and

00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:07,380
it's basically a hosted service so if

00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:08,760
you like the web form module and you

00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:11,040
have non Drupal sites that you would

00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:15,150
like to use web form on you can use the

00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:16,950
web form comm service to empower your

00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:20,250
site with all of the functionality web

00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:22,170
form as a service and it makes it so

00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:23,640
that you can export it and then move it

00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:25,860
to a Drupal site at a later point in

00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:28,860
time so you can export not only data but

00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:31,890
actually all of the code that powers web

00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:34,860
form comm into your own Drupal sites and

00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:37,470
I think that if you really want to have

00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:38,670
a nice demo of web form 4.0 you can just

00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:39,960
go and try it out there because we're

00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:41,939
kind of running like the cutting-edge

00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:43,920
version of just about everything that

00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:49,350
I'm gonna be showing you guys today on

00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:51,360
that web site so web form 4 or web form

00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:54,149
just in general generally widely

00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:56,939
considered to be like the de facto

00:01:54,149 --> 00:02:01,020
standard in making surveys in Drupal

00:01:56,939 --> 00:02:03,780
we're on the cusp of a 4.0 version it's

00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:07,500
usable right now when I made a Drupal

00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:10,379
con honorary release just yesterday that

00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:13,260
is the beta 1 release the final version

00:02:10,379 --> 00:02:14,819
of web form 4 will probably be released

00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:19,500
for the end-of-the-year or targeting for

00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:22,079
November a big thing about webform that

00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:24,060
separates it from something like field

00:02:22,079 --> 00:02:27,120
module is that it's really intended for

00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:29,340
your end users to be utilizing and

00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,940
creating forms so like your editorial

00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:34,950
team the same people that are creating

00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:37,110
articles and blog posts if they also

00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:39,150
need to be empowered to build surveys

00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:42,599
then webform is an excellent choice for

00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:45,569
that task and because it's designed for

00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:48,420
end users it's it's much more direct and

00:02:45,569 --> 00:02:50,940
less complicated than field module field

00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:53,190
module when you're constructing all of

00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:55,250
your content types and fields you're

00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:58,440
really designing your database schema

00:02:55,250 --> 00:03:00,450
webform on the other hand dumps it down

00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:02,790
a whole lot where it's more about

00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:04,859
creating a form than it is about

00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:06,840
creating a database schema and there are

00:03:04,859 --> 00:03:09,060
some downsides to that but also some up

00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:11,459
sites that web form allows you to have

00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:14,190
hundreds or thousands or even hundreds

00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:15,569
of thousands of forms on a single site

00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:17,970
you can have as many web forms as you

00:03:15,569 --> 00:03:20,400
want as opposed to content types where

00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:22,680
after you create like 20 or 30 of them

00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:26,190
it starts getting to have a performance

00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:29,069
drag on your site and sort of is an

00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:30,889
implication of that because web form is

00:03:29,069 --> 00:03:33,720
not based on field so where entities

00:03:30,889 --> 00:03:35,129
that also means that generally whenever

00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:37,590
you you encounter a module that provides

00:03:35,129 --> 00:03:40,500
like a date field or a time field or

00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:41,849
something like that that it won't work

00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,889
right out of the box with web form

00:03:41,849 --> 00:03:45,829
usually there's a companion module that

00:03:43,889 --> 00:03:49,079
it's like the web form underscore

00:03:45,829 --> 00:03:50,519
whatever module like postal code for

00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:52,379
example like there's there's usually a

00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:55,079
web form equivalent for pretty much any

00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:56,909
field out there but if you have one

00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:58,500
module for fields you'll probably need

00:03:56,909 --> 00:04:01,010
to have another one for webform because

00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:04,169
they're basically separate systems and

00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:07,260
the difference between web form and

00:04:04,169 --> 00:04:08,699
fields is that fields generally when

00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:11,519
your editors are creating content

00:04:08,699 --> 00:04:13,319
they're creating content by like a few

00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:15,419
people are creating content that is made

00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:17,909
to be digested by a large number of

00:04:15,419 --> 00:04:20,370
people and web form is sort of the other

00:04:17,909 --> 00:04:23,010
way around where you've got a huge

00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:24,960
number of end users who are on the front

00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:27,420
end of your site maybe even anonymous

00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,770
users and those are the user

00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:31,410
that are actually going to be filling

00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:32,850
out the form and when they fill out the

00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:35,010
form they're going to be sending these

00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:36,930
over to the editorial team or the

00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:38,490
administrative team and the

00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:39,900
administrative team is really going to

00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:42,720
be the people that are looking at all of

00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:44,340
those submissions so end-users are

00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,560
filling out the form hundreds or

00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:49,050
thousands of times and it's only being

00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,820
reviewed by like a smaller subset so

00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:52,710
it's like the reverse basically of what

00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:54,360
you normally think of for four fields

00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:57,060
which of course fields can be used in

00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:58,860
this way too and web form can be used in

00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:00,480
the opposite way also but generally this

00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:02,670
is the way that these these things are

00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:05,460
meant to be used fields are generally

00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:08,030
for admins filling out forms web forms

00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:12,300
are for end-users filling out forms

00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:14,100
there's an exception to this editorial

00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:16,740
team looking at submissions only and

00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:19,440
that's a user who creates submissions

00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:21,420
they always or can have the ability to

00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,340
edit their own submissions after they've

00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:25,110
filled it out so if you've got some kind

00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:26,820
of system where you want to use it to

00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:28,410
come be able to come back and like edit

00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:30,570
the previous submissions or view them

00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:33,150
they have the ability to do that but

00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:34,800
generally end users don't see the

00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:36,720
submissions of other end users there

00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:42,060
they're kind of all isolated from each

00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:43,590
other so the webform interface generally

00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:45,210
is really pretty simple when you enable

00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:47,820
the webform module you'll get a new

00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:50,340
webform content type that when you

00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:53,880
create a new webform node web forms are

00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:55,350
nodes all of all of the webform pieces

00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:57,180
of content we'll end up with two extra

00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:59,610
tabs on them one for webform and then

00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:02,280
one for results and when you look into

00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:05,670
the webform tab you'll get a series of

00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:07,590
sub tabs here the main one is the form

00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:09,060
components page where you'll actually be

00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:11,610
listing out all of the individual

00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:15,090
components that are in it in a

00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:17,010
particular form and web form 3 actually

00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:18,990
some later versions of web form 3 add

00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:21,960
this functionality but I'll reiterate

00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:24,630
here because it's in all versions of web

00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:26,250
form 4 also when you add those new

00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:29,640
components we've got a couple of new

00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:31,530
html5 friendly components now so right

00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:33,060
out-of-the-box you don't need to install

00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:35,850
any other modules in order to have

00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:38,970
webform be html5 compatible we've got

00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:40,960
support for all kinds of html5 things so

00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:43,539
normally like if you haven't

00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,830
textfield you get a normal tech keyboard

00:06:43,539 --> 00:06:47,169
I guess dreese mentioned this in the

00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:50,110
keynote this morning too but if you have

00:06:47,169 --> 00:06:52,509
an email field then you get a different

00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:54,520
keyboard that just matches the type of

00:06:52,509 --> 00:06:56,289
data that's going to be input so a plain

00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:57,759
text field you get like a normal text

00:06:56,289 --> 00:06:59,590
keyboard and when you have an email

00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:01,380
field you get like this keyboard that

00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:03,750
gives you an @ symbol right there

00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:06,610
whenever you're on a mobile device I

00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:09,490
also provide some nice in-line

00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:11,639
validation so if you type in an email

00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:15,370
your browser generally will validate

00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:17,650
that email directly for you in addition

00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:21,310
to like an email field we also have a

00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:23,949
html5 number field which again gives you

00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:29,919
a special keyboard for individual number

00:07:23,949 --> 00:07:31,720
components so back on the components

00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:33,970
page so now we're moving through these

00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:36,610
tabs basically one at a time if we go

00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:38,259
from the forum components where you're

00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:40,599
generally going to be adding and

00:07:38,259 --> 00:07:43,300
modifying your forms take a look at the

00:07:40,599 --> 00:07:45,699
conditionals tab and this is brand new

00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:47,470
feature in in webform for that I think a

00:07:45,699 --> 00:07:50,680
ton of people are really going to love

00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:52,120
and that's conditional support like

00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:54,310
really advanced conditional support

00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:57,909
multiple conditions affecting multiple

00:07:54,310 --> 00:08:00,310
fields and it works on single page forms

00:07:57,909 --> 00:08:01,960
so you can say like if a department is

00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:03,880
something and we're gonna actually do

00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:05,289
this and in the hands-on demo if a

00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:09,070
department is something then hide or

00:08:05,289 --> 00:08:11,440
show a field set or a field on the same

00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:13,150
page or if you have a multiple page form

00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:15,479
then you can hide the field on the next

00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:17,680
form or you could skip the entire page

00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:20,889
webform three had some conditional

00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:23,800
support but it was severely limited you

00:08:20,889 --> 00:08:25,570
could only do one action ever and it

00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:27,759
would only work across multiple pages in

00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:30,849
web form for we now have same page

00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:33,279
support and multiple options it's it's a

00:08:30,849 --> 00:08:35,380
lot better and the interfaces is really

00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:38,529
great and we'll go through that when we

00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:41,260
do the hands-on so keeping moving

00:08:38,529 --> 00:08:44,500
through the tabs the most common thing

00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:47,020
people do with web forms is when they

00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:49,120
when a user fills out the form usually

00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:50,770
the user wants to get an email or the

00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,209
administrator wants to get an email so

00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:54,490
web form is a really good replacement

00:08:52,209 --> 00:08:58,060
for like contact module if you

00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:59,350
have a much more elaborate contact form

00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:01,600
that just says like one or two more

00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:03,610
fields or if you want to have multiple

00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,770
contact forms for different things like

00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:08,080
a job application form versus the normal

00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:09,370
contact form then you can set up a web

00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:12,550
form for each of those and have them

00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:17,560
behave differently so when you set up an

00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:18,730
individual email in web form you get to

00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:20,529
choose like whether or not you want to

00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:23,860
email that to like a specific like

00:09:20,529 --> 00:09:26,529
hard-coded email address or you can send

00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:28,330
it to the value of a component so this

00:09:26,529 --> 00:09:29,920
is useful and we'll do this during the

00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:31,839
hands-on like if you want to send one

00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:34,060
email to the administrator of the

00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:35,740
website but then you had the user type

00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:37,570
in their email address when they started

00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:39,580
filling out the form it's really common

00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:41,080
you'll want to send a receipt back to

00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:42,910
the user saying you know thank you for

00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:45,640
filling out the form we received your

00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:48,010
submission here's a copy of it and do

00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:49,779
that sort of thing so you can make it so

00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:53,050
that you can send an email to any value

00:09:49,779 --> 00:09:55,300
of another component on the web form so

00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:56,680
we have two types of components that you

00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:58,089
can send email to like the email

00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:01,020
component if you want to send the user

00:09:58,089 --> 00:10:04,329
receipt or if you have a select list

00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:06,279
this is new functionality in webform for

00:10:04,329 --> 00:10:07,959
also if you have a select list now you

00:10:06,279 --> 00:10:09,940
used to have to do this really weird

00:10:07,959 --> 00:10:11,680
thing where you would have to use a key

00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:14,620
the email address you would have to use

00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:16,240
as the key and then the value of the

00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:18,339
select list you would have to use as the

00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:20,950
label which is a really terrible thing

00:10:18,339 --> 00:10:25,000
on a lot of levels now in web form for

00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:27,610
when you select a radio buttons or

00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,790
select list as the destination for an

00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:32,709
email it does this nice thing where it

00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:36,430
automatically gives you a whole bunch of

00:10:32,709 --> 00:10:37,930
fields that match the options in the

00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:40,029
Select list and you can choose like when

00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:41,980
this option is selected send emails to

00:10:40,029 --> 00:10:43,690
these people and you can come and

00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:45,279
separate them so you can send like if

00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:47,620
the user selects some particular

00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:52,480
category send it to multiple email

00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:53,980
addresses at the same time also new if

00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,230
you if you were to scroll down further

00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:57,339
when configuring an email address and

00:10:56,230 --> 00:11:01,300
we're gonna go through this at the end

00:10:57,339 --> 00:11:04,839
we also now have finally finally real

00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:07,209
Drupal 7 style tokens so all of the

00:11:04,839 --> 00:11:08,230
normal token ability you now have in web

00:11:07,209 --> 00:11:10,600
form web form uses

00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:12,340
for everything and it provides some of

00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:14,620
its own tokens to make it so you can

00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:16,300
pull out the submitted values the user

00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:19,660
filled out in the form and include that

00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:22,900
in like the the email templates the

00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:24,820
confirmation messages the redirect URLs

00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:26,680
anywhere where there's any text field

00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:28,960
and Drupal default values you can

00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:31,620
populate those values with tokens now

00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:38,620
which is much more powerful than the old

00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:40,480
webform 3 style tokens so the form

00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:43,420
settings page not a whole lot has

00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:46,420
changed on this page from from webform 3

00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:48,430
you still have all of the mishmash

00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:50,260
settings that you could possibly want to

00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:52,600
customize the functionality of your form

00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:54,880
we still have the ability to do things

00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:58,240
like save as draft or save automatically

00:11:54,880 --> 00:12:00,430
in between pages options for limiting

00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:03,670
access control limiting the number of

00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:05,770
submissions per hour or the number of

00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:07,870
submissions per user we did add the

00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:09,660
ability to limit the total number of

00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:11,770
submissions also which we didn't have

00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:14,950
previously some more limiting options

00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:16,930
and there were in the past and a neat

00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:19,870
thing that was added just very recently

00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:22,150
as we finally added real built-in

00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:24,790
support for progress bars so if you have

00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:28,720
a multiple page form that has like say

00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:30,910
four or five pages you usually want to

00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,920
indicate to the user how far along in

00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:34,870
the process of filling out a form they

00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:37,060
are and there's now just simply an

00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:39,250
option here for enabling a progress bar

00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:42,190
and a couple of options to customize how

00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:44,200
that progress bar actually appears so by

00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:46,780
default if you turn it on and you've got

00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:49,180
a couple of page breaks then it'll end

00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:51,550
up looking something like this where you

00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:53,260
this is an example with four pages and

00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:55,240
you can decide whether or not you want

00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:57,370
the confirmation page to be included in

00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:58,510
that progress bar or not so it makes it

00:12:57,370 --> 00:13:00,340
so that when you get to the last page

00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:02,230
you know the last item in the progress

00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:04,000
bar is is then highlighted if you were

00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:05,770
doing like a confirmation message

00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,240
there's just a message rather than the

00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:08,980
confirmation page you'd want to turn

00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:11,200
that off so there'd only be three steps

00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:12,910
in here because the fourth step would

00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,500
just be a message saying thanks for

00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:17,850
filling out the form and then redirect

00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:17,850
you to some other place on the site

00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:24,680
so that's it for the main webform tabs

00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:27,710
not a whole lot changing in there the

00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:29,690
webform results tab is very similar not

00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:33,200
a whole lot has changed here either the

00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:35,750
submissions listing currently we're

00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:38,150
working towards replacing all of the

00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:40,340
listings in all of webform with views so

00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:43,550
webform 4 depends on views and see tools

00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:46,010
now and we have full view support in

00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:48,110
webform 4 which is really great so we

00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:50,510
can access all of the data and we can

00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:52,310
access all of the submissions directly

00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:54,440
in views now we're just not using it

00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:55,040
built-in with the module yet like out of

00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,480
the box

00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,950
but we're planning on converting all of

00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:00,050
the listings and all of Drupal to use

00:13:57,950 --> 00:14:02,810
view is pretty much everywhere so every

00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:04,640
view you have in all of webform you'll

00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:06,050
be able to override and change like I

00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:08,570
know a lot of people don't care about

00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:10,640
like the IP address or the user name

00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:12,440
when it comes to looking at submissions

00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:15,830
so you'd be able to customize that and

00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:17,630
drop those out of these listings you can

00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:21,620
do that today it's just not not built

00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:24,110
out of the box yet the analysis tab got

00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:25,910
an overhaul recently where the analysis

00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:27,440
tab used to show you all of the

00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:29,660
information about all of the components

00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:33,020
all at the same time but after thinking

00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:35,120
about it we found that the analysis tab

00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:37,640
really shouldn't be giving you analysis

00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:39,530
out of buy defaults on things like text

00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:41,690
fields and text areas and email

00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:43,280
addresses just because there isn't a

00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:44,810
whole lot of useful statistics that you

00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:47,030
can pull out of like an email address

00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:49,310
like whether or not the user filled it

00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:50,750
out is about and like the length of the

00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:53,120
string like that's about all that you

00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:55,310
can do as far as analysis goes you can

00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:57,950
still enable that functionality but by

00:14:55,310 --> 00:15:00,140
default we now only generate analysis on

00:14:57,950 --> 00:15:02,420
like the Select lists and grid

00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:04,370
components because those are ones that

00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:06,770
you know there's a finite number of

00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:08,510
choices and so you can generate some

00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:10,970
useful numbers on like you want to see

00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:15,440
like how many people selected a

00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:18,680
particular choice so with this redesign

00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:21,740
we segmented out the useful data like

00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:23,930
the analytic data from the peripheral

00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:25,820
data like we used to combine it all

00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:27,950
together like if you had select or other

00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:30,110
module enabled you can make it so that

00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:31,700
the user can select like a finite number

00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:32,089
of choices and then select the last one

00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:34,160
which

00:15:32,089 --> 00:15:36,139
the other checkbox and then they would

00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:38,769
type in something that was other than

00:15:36,139 --> 00:15:40,910
the the options that that were given and

00:15:38,769 --> 00:15:42,920
previously we just jammed all that data

00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:45,050
together which made it really hard to

00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:47,480
actually provide some like useful data

00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:50,540
on it but now we separate that

00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:52,040
information out the primary analytics

00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:54,170
and basically all the peripheral data

00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:56,689
and it makes it so that we can now

00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:58,910
finally chart this information so

00:15:56,689 --> 00:16:02,329
there's a two modules actually that came

00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:06,470
out just really recently terribly named

00:16:02,329 --> 00:16:08,600
web form chart and web form charts so

00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:10,730
ones plural one singular I'm sorry I

00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:12,350
hate it when that happens but they both

00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:14,809
do a really excellent job of charting

00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:16,970
data in web form due to this new ability

00:16:14,809 --> 00:16:19,759
so this is when you enable web form

00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:22,160
charts module the exact same page that

00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:24,709
analytics page now includes charts on

00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:26,689
every single one of those analytics so

00:16:24,709 --> 00:16:28,279
you can take that same data and then

00:16:26,689 --> 00:16:31,309
chart it out and then you have a really

00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:34,699
nice visualization of all of the results

00:16:31,309 --> 00:16:36,259
that are on those pages another cool

00:16:34,699 --> 00:16:37,730
thing about these charts that we're

00:16:36,259 --> 00:16:40,220
going to do on the hands-on is they also

00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:42,110
provide tokens which means that you can

00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:44,389
use these charts and other places like

00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:46,370
anywhere you have access to tokens you

00:16:44,389 --> 00:16:48,649
can then pull out charts and like

00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:50,839
basically make like reports if you will

00:16:48,649 --> 00:16:52,639
anywhere you want as long as you can

00:16:50,839 --> 00:16:54,889
access that node through a token like

00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:57,170
you have node reference field point to a

00:16:54,889 --> 00:17:02,269
webform pull out some charts out of it

00:16:57,170 --> 00:17:03,769
it's pretty cool the table page table

00:17:02,269 --> 00:17:06,110
page just generally just lists

00:17:03,769 --> 00:17:08,480
everything all all of your submissions

00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:09,709
that you've gotten all at once not much

00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,230
has changed here either this is

00:17:09,709 --> 00:17:15,260
basically the just show me everything

00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:23,750
page again likely to be replaced with

00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:26,899
views but not quite there yet we've also

00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:29,029
got some like subtler changes here on

00:17:26,899 --> 00:17:30,710
the download page so the download page

00:17:29,029 --> 00:17:32,360
is where you can take all of the

00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:35,570
information all of these submissions

00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:39,409
that you've received and then export

00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:41,179
them down to excel or a CSV or TSV so

00:17:39,409 --> 00:17:42,850
you can like process them and you're in

00:17:41,179 --> 00:17:46,000
your favorite spreadsheet application

00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:49,330
but now we've got a

00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:51,759
nice change that the excel files that

00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:53,200
you download previously we were we were

00:17:51,759 --> 00:17:56,139
totally cheating I don't think most

00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:58,720
people noticed but when you downloaded

00:17:56,139 --> 00:18:01,240
an excel file previously it really

00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:03,490
wasn't an excel file it was a tab

00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:07,049
separated value file that just had the

00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:09,639
extension changed from TSV to XLS and

00:18:07,049 --> 00:18:11,590
then Excel would open it and pretend it

00:18:09,639 --> 00:18:13,450
was an excel file which was a glorious

00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:15,940
hack and worked for like a lot of years

00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:18,549
but ended some like weird funny problems

00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:20,679
with utf-8 encoding it would be strange

00:18:18,549 --> 00:18:22,389
from time to time you would lose new

00:18:20,679 --> 00:18:24,399
lines or it would break the importer

00:18:22,389 --> 00:18:27,399
depending on which version of excel you

00:18:24,399 --> 00:18:30,549
used all kinds of weird problems time

00:18:27,399 --> 00:18:32,710
zone problems and now we ship out of the

00:18:30,549 --> 00:18:35,379
box with a built-in native Excel

00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:39,279
exporter so now when you download an

00:18:35,379 --> 00:18:41,169
excel file it's a real xlsx file which

00:18:39,279 --> 00:18:50,830
means all of those problems all go away

00:18:41,169 --> 00:18:52,659
which is a huge boon so oh yeah and we

00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:54,279
also have some other new abilities so

00:18:52,659 --> 00:18:56,350
this is when you do the export and now

00:18:54,279 --> 00:18:59,169
uses batch API so it doesn't matter how

00:18:56,350 --> 00:19:00,370
small or big your your excel file is and

00:18:59,169 --> 00:19:02,590
that could now can do hundreds of

00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:04,419
thousands of rows and so this is an

00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:07,840
export that used batch API and then

00:19:04,419 --> 00:19:09,870
export to excel and not a lot of people

00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:12,669
know this but web form also has

00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:14,830
pluggable exporters so you can turn on

00:19:12,669 --> 00:19:16,870
different exporters too and what this is

00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:20,110
demonstrating is there's a module called

00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:23,049
web form Google exporter that allows you

00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:26,110
to set up an API key with Google Drive

00:19:23,049 --> 00:19:28,659
and then you can export does the same

00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:30,399
thing use this batch API generates an

00:19:28,659 --> 00:19:33,070
excel file but then it sends it over to

00:19:30,399 --> 00:19:36,070
Google Drive and so here this is using

00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:39,460
OAuth choosing which account to sign in

00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:41,500
with and then now it's on Google Docs

00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:43,360
which is pretty cool so no need to

00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:45,909
download the file and upload it again if

00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:48,009
you prefer to use Google Docs or have a

00:19:45,909 --> 00:19:50,470
company uses cool Docs all the time you

00:19:48,009 --> 00:19:52,360
can just export directly now right from

00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:54,700
web form right into Google Docs which is

00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:56,799
really cool and again a benefit of using

00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:59,640
that excel native exporter because

00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:03,450
Google reads in those xlsx X

00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:08,220
and then yeah you got a perfect import

00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:12,240
every time it's great so some other new

00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:13,830
features we have I mentioned this

00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:16,559
built-in views integration for both

00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:18,059
submissions and data now so you can make

00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:21,330
a listing of pretty much of anything you

00:20:18,059 --> 00:20:24,809
possibly could want we now have a

00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:27,000
built-in drush exporter so if you you

00:20:24,809 --> 00:20:32,250
guys any dress fans in the room there's

00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:34,919
now an nude rush command drush wfx for

00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:36,660
webform exports and it has all of the

00:20:34,919 --> 00:20:39,600
options that you can get from the normal

00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:41,640
exporting page and it also uses batch AP

00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:44,130
and I see you can export anything you

00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:45,780
want to with drush we have I'm not

00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:47,580
really sure what the use cases for this

00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:50,040
but it keeps coming up that people want

00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:52,830
to do some weird thing where they want

00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:54,720
to generate an excel file like on a

00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:58,770
nightly basis and then email it to

00:20:54,720 --> 00:21:00,299
somebody and now that's possible because

00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:02,040
you can you can just simply set up a

00:21:00,299 --> 00:21:05,309
like a cron job or something I've done

00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:06,990
on your server run rush webform export

00:21:05,309 --> 00:21:09,360
and then mail the results and you can

00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:11,850
get those nightly updates of Excel files

00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:15,059
for whatever purpose like I imagine it's

00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:16,590
for some kind of like continuous

00:21:15,059 --> 00:21:20,340
integration thing or something like that

00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:21,929
now totally possible improve conditional

00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:23,700
email sending options that's the thing I

00:21:21,929 --> 00:21:25,740
mentioned earlier where now when you use

00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:27,510
a select list you have much better

00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:30,510
options for choosing where those emails

00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:33,030
go to type your integration with form

00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:36,480
builder module so form builder module is

00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:38,850
not required but it can really make a

00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:40,290
huge difference to your end-users web

00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:42,059
form and form builder work really well

00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:44,250
together form builder basically is a

00:21:42,059 --> 00:21:45,750
drag-and-drop interface for constructing

00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:47,400
your forms that can really speed up the

00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:50,400
process of creating a form and we're

00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:52,830
going to do that in the demo too we have

00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:55,950
things we enabled cookie only tracking

00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:58,110
finally there's a common complaint or

00:21:55,950 --> 00:22:01,890
yeah a common complaint with webform 3

00:21:58,110 --> 00:22:04,049
that if you restricted users to say only

00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:05,880
fill out one submission ever if you had

00:22:04,049 --> 00:22:09,150
two people like that we use the same

00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:10,950
computer like logged in logged out or a

00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:13,080
bunch of people behind a firewall or a

00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:13,330
router they would all be considered the

00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:15,580
same

00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:17,680
person basically and now you can disable

00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:20,650
that IP checking and use like a more

00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:22,330
lenient cookie based checking so that's

00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:25,750
you don't end up with users not being

00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:28,030
able to fill out the form in addition to

00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:30,490
html5 elements we've added html5

00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:32,200
placeholders so the placeholder text

00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:36,130
that you know will fill in a particular

00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:38,830
field until a user clicks in it and we

00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:40,600
added customizable CSS classes so just

00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:42,340
like views and panels how you can

00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:43,930
specify individual classes they want for

00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:46,720
all of your fields there's now built-in

00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:50,500
UI options for that and we also did a

00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:51,970
job real recently we stopped using any

00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:53,380
designers that are in the room that

00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:56,230
might appreciate this or front-end devs

00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:58,150
we stopped using IDs everywhere that was

00:22:56,230 --> 00:23:00,220
possible and switched them all to using

00:22:58,150 --> 00:23:02,740
classes so now if you've got the same

00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:04,600
webform on the page for more than one

00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:06,460
time for some reason you don't end up

00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:09,790
with all of the IDS changing on you and

00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:14,620
all of your CSS breaking so just it's

00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:16,780
small things all right so now I'm gonna

00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:18,820
go through a couple of webform like

00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:20,680
tricks basically like there are some fun

00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:23,410
things you can do with webform that not

00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:26,530
everybody is aware of so I was like

00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:29,650
going through these these tricks so web

00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:32,680
forms are nodes that's an ingrained part

00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:34,030
of how a webform works but because the

00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:35,740
nodes that means you can do all of these

00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:38,200
other things that you can do with nodes

00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:40,210
you can you can use node clone module

00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:41,980
you can use node export module you can

00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:44,020
use scheduler you can use any access

00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:46,990
control module like ogee or taxonomy

00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:49,360
access or whatever and all of those

00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:51,010
things work great with web forms so if

00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:54,100
you enable like the node clone module

00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:56,860
and node export module then you get

00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:58,300
these tabs on your pages on on all of

00:23:56,860 --> 00:24:00,130
your web form nodes that you can say

00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:02,620
clone and you can immediately take a

00:24:00,130 --> 00:24:04,270
webform and then make a copy of it or if

00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:06,550
you have to know to export module turned

00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:08,800
on then you get this export tab and you

00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:10,540
can get like a JSON representation of a

00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:13,030
webform if you want to build a webform

00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:15,280
on like a demo and your localhost export

00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:16,900
it into JSON just copy and paste that

00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:19,210
into your live server then you can do

00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:23,650
that because it's all just nodes

00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:25,480
basically if you haven't used this

00:24:23,650 --> 00:24:27,730
module before I highly suggest you use

00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:29,260
it even if you don't use form builder

00:24:27,730 --> 00:24:31,360
form builder depends on it but there's a

00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:34,779
great module called options element an

00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:36,909
options element simply gets rid of this

00:24:34,779 --> 00:24:39,580
terrible pattern that we have in Drupal

00:24:36,909 --> 00:24:42,659
of giving users a big text area and

00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:45,639
telling them to type something pipe

00:24:42,659 --> 00:24:47,590
value you know like key pipe value I

00:24:45,639 --> 00:24:49,990
think that's a terrible user design

00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:51,820
pattern to ask users to type into a text

00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:54,340
field that ultimately will turn into a

00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:56,440
list of select options and so with

00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:58,450
options element it takes those same

00:24:56,440 --> 00:25:00,850
fields webform just will swap it out and

00:24:58,450 --> 00:25:03,909
use options element instead which gives

00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:05,740
you this much nicer interface of hiding

00:25:03,909 --> 00:25:07,809
the keys entirely it'll automatically

00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:10,090
create keys for you that are just

00:25:07,809 --> 00:25:12,000
integers and if you want to the user can

00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:14,169
still click on like this customize keys

00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,450
option right down below and enter in

00:25:14,169 --> 00:25:18,909
manual keys if they feel the need to do

00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:20,620
that but for the most part your users

00:25:18,909 --> 00:25:23,559
shouldn't never really need to worry

00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:28,179
about keys and so this hides that option

00:25:23,559 --> 00:25:30,309
from them basically another fun thing

00:25:28,179 --> 00:25:32,470
you can do this is with the token

00:25:30,309 --> 00:25:34,029
support in webform I realize this is

00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:35,440
probably oh you guys could probably see

00:25:34,029 --> 00:25:38,260
that just fine

00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:40,929
so you can use tokens to populate the

00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:42,130
default values of any field and it's

00:25:40,929 --> 00:25:44,950
really common that you'll want to

00:25:42,130 --> 00:25:47,289
populate some information about the page

00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:50,590
that the user is currently on like if

00:25:47,289 --> 00:25:52,419
you make webform some particular webform

00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:54,220
into a block webform has the option to

00:25:52,419 --> 00:25:55,570
turn any form into a block and then you

00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:57,850
can place it anywhere on the site that

00:25:55,570 --> 00:26:00,159
you want it's common that people use

00:25:57,850 --> 00:26:02,260
this for like a feedback form that lives

00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:04,929
permanently in the sidebar or in a modal

00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:06,880
or something like that and then when the

00:26:04,929 --> 00:26:09,309
user fills out the form you usually want

00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:11,200
to know what page they were on when they

00:26:09,309 --> 00:26:12,789
filled out the submission form if they

00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:15,159
especially if it's like feedback on this

00:26:12,789 --> 00:26:16,750
particular page and so you can do

00:26:15,159 --> 00:26:19,090
something like you can make a hidden

00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:21,820
field on the page and then populate it

00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:24,220
with the token like current page URL

00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:26,260
absolute that will give you the full URL

00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:28,419
of the page the user is currently on

00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:30,460
when they're filling out the form so it

00:26:28,419 --> 00:26:31,840
populates a hidden field and then when

00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:33,130
they submit the form you'll have that

00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,700
information when it comes into your

00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:36,370
inbox

00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:37,570
so you could see exactly if they say you

00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:39,250
know the alignment is off in your

00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:41,169
headline or the image is smashed into

00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:41,710
the sidebar if it's a layout problem

00:26:41,169 --> 00:26:43,600
then

00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:47,110
you can immediately know what page that

00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:49,360
it was that they're talking about so

00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:51,039
this is what that looks like so if even

00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:52,450
it's a hidden field the user will never

00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:54,190
be able to see it they won't know that

00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:56,500
they're submitting this value but then

00:26:54,190 --> 00:26:58,570
when you get that email in from our

00:26:56,500 --> 00:27:00,399
email or look at the submission in the

00:26:58,570 --> 00:27:05,710
results page it will populate that

00:27:00,399 --> 00:27:07,149
hidden field also with tokens it's

00:27:05,710 --> 00:27:10,149
really common that people want to

00:27:07,149 --> 00:27:12,309
pre-populate fields not with stuff that

00:27:10,149 --> 00:27:14,529
is known but like pre-populated with

00:27:12,309 --> 00:27:18,940
something from like the URL like if you

00:27:14,529 --> 00:27:21,580
have a let's say you have a particular

00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:25,299
node or like let's say that on Drupal

00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:29,529
cons website they session submissions

00:27:25,299 --> 00:27:32,740
like our evaluations like you might want

00:27:29,529 --> 00:27:34,840
to have a link to a survey that says you

00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:36,580
know evaluate this session but you want

00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:38,440
to pre populate a field whether it's

00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:40,720
hidden field or select list or whatever

00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:43,779
with the session that the user is

00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:45,820
evaluating you can do that by generating

00:27:43,779 --> 00:27:48,070
a specific link that just has a query

00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:50,200
string at the end of it and then link to

00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:53,260
that particular web form and then

00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:56,350
populate again the default value of some

00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:58,570
field with the query string so this is

00:27:56,350 --> 00:28:02,529
using the special token current page

00:27:58,570 --> 00:28:05,590
query foo for example and then in your

00:28:02,529 --> 00:28:08,730
browser you make a link to whatever that

00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:10,779
the webform is question mark foo equals

00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:12,970
whatever value you want to be and then

00:28:10,779 --> 00:28:14,880
I'll pre populate that field whether

00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:17,169
it's a hidden field or text field or

00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:18,669
select list it doesn't matter what so it

00:28:17,169 --> 00:28:20,799
makes it so basically webform has a

00:28:18,669 --> 00:28:27,610
built-in ability to pre-populate any

00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:30,279
field from the URL and lastly if sending

00:28:27,610 --> 00:28:31,330
HTML or pretty emails is important to

00:28:30,279 --> 00:28:34,360
you

00:28:31,330 --> 00:28:37,899
webform now supports both my mail and

00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:41,289
HTML mail both excellent projects that

00:28:37,899 --> 00:28:43,899
enable you send full HTML rich text

00:28:41,289 --> 00:28:46,570
emails to your users and webform has

00:28:43,899 --> 00:28:48,279
built-in integration with both of them

00:28:46,570 --> 00:28:51,490
so it makes it so that if you want to

00:28:48,279 --> 00:28:53,620
send an HTML email to a user you can

00:28:51,490 --> 00:28:55,800
actually include all of the exact same

00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:57,630
CSS that you see like

00:28:55,800 --> 00:29:00,150
when you're viewing a submission you can

00:28:57,630 --> 00:29:01,890
send all of that CSS and markup to a

00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:04,860
users inbox and have a really nicely

00:29:01,890 --> 00:29:07,740
formatted submission that's delivered

00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:09,960
via email you can also turn on this

00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:12,150
option to include all files as

00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:14,910
attachments so whenever if you have a

00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:16,980
file filled in your web form to do

00:29:14,910 --> 00:29:18,870
things like upload an image or PDF or a

00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:20,640
resume or something like that when the

00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:23,130
users attaches that files or their

00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:25,290
submission and it send you can send that

00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:30,240
attachment or send that file as an

00:29:25,290 --> 00:29:32,010
attachment in the email okay so I'm

00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,990
gonna do do a little bit of a hands-on

00:29:32,010 --> 00:29:39,060
demo here of some of the new things that

00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:41,880
we can do so this is the first email

00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:43,910
that I've got our first webform that

00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:46,710
I've gotten I'm just gonna do some oh

00:29:43,910 --> 00:29:53,670
you guys can't see anything yet one

00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:55,350
second there we go okay so in this

00:29:53,670 --> 00:29:58,020
simple example I've just got a contact

00:29:55,350 --> 00:30:00,450
form this is by far like the most common

00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:03,810
use case for webform where you just want

00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:06,840
to have a form that has a few fields

00:30:03,810 --> 00:30:10,260
here for subject your name email and

00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:13,350
then like a file I guess if you want to

00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:15,090
send it send some information and so to

00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:17,640
walk through the interface like here's

00:30:15,090 --> 00:30:20,250
the main components page and you might

00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:23,100
want to do something like add in a new

00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:25,800
thing for like who which which group or

00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:29,610
person you want to contact so maybe I

00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:32,340
have a thing for Department and this is

00:30:29,610 --> 00:30:37,170
going to be a select list or radio

00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:40,470
buttons and then here's this list of

00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:43,530
options here that if I had not you if I

00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:45,000
didn't have the options element module

00:30:43,530 --> 00:30:47,370
enable it get something much more like

00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:56,670
this where you would just have to enter

00:30:47,370 --> 00:31:00,150
in you know like general support and

00:30:56,670 --> 00:31:02,040
sales or something like that but if you

00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:04,410
have if you have options element turned

00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:06,660
on then you could do the same thing only

00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:08,460
do it in sort of a much friendlier

00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:11,420
manner and then select which default

00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:11,420
value you want to have

00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:17,870
so that's generally the process reading

00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:21,080
opponent and then you can see here that

00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:23,990
now got radio button options here for

00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:28,399
for which Department is sent to so now

00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:29,630
if I were to take the same the same form

00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:31,880
so I've already got a couple of emails

00:31:29,630 --> 00:31:34,820
set up here I've got one that is set up

00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:37,120
a hard-coded email to just fill out to

00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:40,070
like Nate at localhost don't localhost

00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:43,220
and then I also have an email here to

00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:47,480
send a receipt back to the user who

00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:49,580
filled out the form so in this case it's

00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:52,010
saying the email to address is going to

00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:55,130
be the value of a component which is the

00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:56,779
your email value and then you can

00:31:55,130 --> 00:31:58,940
customize everything about that email

00:31:56,779 --> 00:32:00,529
you can give it a custom subject so you

00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:02,840
can say you know thank you for

00:32:00,529 --> 00:32:04,820
contacting us

00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:07,250
you can choose like who it's from the

00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:08,600
from address the from name and then you

00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:11,450
can customize the template for each

00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:13,039
individual email that you configure so

00:32:11,450 --> 00:32:15,049
in this case this is pretty much the

00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:16,760
default template but if you're sending

00:32:15,049 --> 00:32:18,140
this back to the user who filled out the

00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:20,510
form you probably want to do something

00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:23,809
more like say you know thanks for

00:32:20,510 --> 00:32:28,490
contacting us you know we've got your

00:32:23,809 --> 00:32:29,960
message and then say like you know

00:32:28,490 --> 00:32:35,630
here's a copy for your records or

00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:38,480
something like that so and then using

00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:40,159
tokens any token that's supported in

00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:42,860
webform you can add any token you want

00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:44,899
in here so here's a copy for your

00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:46,940
records and then that will list out a

00:32:44,899 --> 00:32:49,399
copy of the entire submission basically

00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:51,289
if you want to you can use there's token

00:32:49,399 --> 00:32:52,700
for basically every individual field and

00:32:51,289 --> 00:32:54,620
value so if you want to pull out

00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:56,720
individual values and you know thank you

00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:58,789
for contacting the blank department you

00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:00,200
know blank we'll be back in touch with

00:32:58,789 --> 00:33:02,120
you soon you can do all of those things

00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:07,460
by pulling out the individual fields

00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:09,710
values so and if you wanted to do like I

00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:10,909
just set up that Department one so this

00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:12,169
is getting a little bit elaborate

00:33:10,909 --> 00:33:14,600
because it's pretty unusual you would

00:33:12,169 --> 00:33:17,419
have three emails on something but for

00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:19,490
this department field you can see here

00:33:17,419 --> 00:33:22,159
that we're still selecting it based on a

00:33:19,490 --> 00:33:23,600
component so based on the value of the

00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:25,760
department field that is submitted

00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:27,830
we will send the user or send an email

00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:29,780
to a particular user and this is where

00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:33,230
you fill out individual things like you

00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:36,560
would say Joe at example.com if it's

00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:40,250
general or support is just support at

00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:41,210
example.com and sales is like set that

00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:42,740
example that com

00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:46,970
for example and if you want to you could

00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:48,590
also say you know Matt at example.com so

00:33:46,970 --> 00:33:50,900
you can come and separate them and then

00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:54,110
send as many emails as you want based on

00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:56,480
the option that was selected so now when

00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:58,520
this thing fills out you'll get three

00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:00,680
emails well somebody will get three

00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:05,390
emails so if I want to say you know

00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:07,280
interested in your project so this is

00:34:05,390 --> 00:34:09,710
this is pre-populated with my username

00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:11,330
and that's because that's that's the way

00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:13,790
that the forum is set up so there's

00:34:11,330 --> 00:34:16,340
token here to say populate with the

00:34:13,790 --> 00:34:23,450
users current name it doesn't have to be

00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:25,100
that way and then based on which one of

00:34:23,450 --> 00:34:27,350
these departments that I have it's going

00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:29,090
to email a different thing since those

00:34:27,350 --> 00:34:30,320
are all example comm emails I'm not

00:34:29,090 --> 00:34:34,220
actually sure what's going to happen

00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:35,990
here because I'm not sure that the

00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:37,820
internet will actually like me sending

00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:40,370
emails like that so anyway

00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:44,030
sent the forum and now on my email over

00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:47,270
here so I sent a couple emails to local

00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:49,250
host so I should now get so here we go

00:34:47,270 --> 00:34:52,430
so here are the two emails so this is

00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:55,610
the one that was the first one that is

00:34:52,430 --> 00:34:57,320
the email that's used the subject that

00:34:55,610 --> 00:34:59,870
the user filled out and sent to the

00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:02,240
administrator and then this is the one

00:34:59,870 --> 00:35:03,650
that since I was both the sender and the

00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:05,120
receiver if this is the receipt email

00:35:03,650 --> 00:35:06,950
that came back to me that said you know

00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:08,360
thanks for contacting us so it's got a

00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:10,430
different subject it's got a different

00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:11,960
template and different things that are

00:35:10,430 --> 00:35:13,550
all coming in so you can set up as many

00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:14,990
different emails as you want set them up

00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:20,960
with different subject set them up with

00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:24,800
different bodies do whatever so with the

00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:26,180
same example I also want to go over some

00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:28,280
of the new abilities that we can do with

00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:29,830
like the new analytics that we have so

00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:32,300
right now when we look at the web form

00:35:29,830 --> 00:35:33,680
and we look at the results so all of

00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:35,990
those submissions that come through you

00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:37,250
can get all of them both an email and it

00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:39,620
records all of them

00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:42,110
but then we can also look at the

00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:44,450
analysis of all of these values that got

00:35:42,110 --> 00:35:46,040
filled out so this currently only has

00:35:44,450 --> 00:35:48,650
you know I've only had fill out this

00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:51,320
form once that has this department

00:35:48,650 --> 00:35:53,870
filled filled out but if I were to go

00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:56,990
and turn on the webform charts module

00:35:53,870 --> 00:35:59,810
which the webform charts module is just

00:35:56,990 --> 00:36:03,830
you know drupal.org slash project slash

00:35:59,810 --> 00:36:06,980
webform charts and this module works

00:36:03,830 --> 00:36:08,780
with a couple of differents while the

00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:10,220
charts module i should say works with a

00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:12,320
couple of different options you can use

00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:14,810
google charts if you want or you can use

00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:18,100
hi charts module or hi charts library

00:36:14,810 --> 00:36:21,200
either one will work the google charts

00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:23,540
solution is really great because it

00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:25,820
doesn't require any additional downloads

00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:27,830
or libraries or anything it'll just pull

00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:30,050
google charts right out of the internet

00:36:27,830 --> 00:36:31,670
basically and start using it but if you

00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:34,370
are in a situation where you don't have

00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:36,020
reliable internet then you might want to

00:36:34,370 --> 00:36:37,970
use like high charts because you can use

00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:39,980
a local copy of it so i've got high

00:36:37,970 --> 00:36:43,580
charts going on right now on this

00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:46,550
individual localhost and when i go back

00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:49,760
to that page where i look at my web form

00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:52,430
results now I've got charts here for

00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:55,910
each one of those analysis things going

00:36:52,430 --> 00:36:57,890
on and it's also nice like this is one

00:36:55,910 --> 00:37:00,290
of those not so useful charts where I've

00:36:57,890 --> 00:37:01,850
got like a text field so this is how

00:37:00,290 --> 00:37:04,010
many people left the field blank and I

00:37:01,850 --> 00:37:07,760
mean people filled it out if you want to

00:37:04,010 --> 00:37:09,260
you can add or remove as many of the

00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:11,150
fields as you want so you can get

00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:12,290
analysis on more of the fields if there

00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:14,270
are fields that you want additional

00:37:12,290 --> 00:37:16,400
information on or if you want less

00:37:14,270 --> 00:37:18,320
information on and then in addition for

00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:21,800
each one of these we can go into these

00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:23,420
chart options here and if this if I had

00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:26,360
a slightly larger screen these would be

00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:28,310
side-by-side but in this case you can

00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:29,780
choose like which chart you want and it

00:37:28,310 --> 00:37:32,890
will change the chart type right there

00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:35,930
and then if you want to do things like

00:37:32,890 --> 00:37:38,210
change the individual colors on things

00:37:35,930 --> 00:37:39,890
you can do that really easily just by

00:37:38,210 --> 00:37:42,260
you know selecting the thing right here

00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:43,640
and it will update it if you were using

00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:46,340
google charts it wouldn't use it it

00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:48,680
wouldn't quite do it on the fly a little

00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:50,300
bit more limited on the API side but

00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:50,990
with high charts like as you modify the

00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:52,850
things

00:37:50,990 --> 00:37:53,840
immediately updates the chart and then

00:37:52,850 --> 00:37:55,730
it will remember that chart

00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:58,100
configuration and then everywhere you

00:37:55,730 --> 00:38:00,470
use this chart either as a token or

00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:02,270
looking at the results it will save all

00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:04,070
of those settings so you can have pie

00:38:02,270 --> 00:38:09,050
charts or graphs charts or whatever kind

00:38:04,070 --> 00:38:12,530
of chart you want oh yeah so nice thing

00:38:09,050 --> 00:38:15,770
about doing charts like this is really

00:38:12,530 --> 00:38:18,080
now if you combine webform with charts

00:38:15,770 --> 00:38:21,320
you basically have a really advanced

00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:22,760
pull solution so you can stop using pull

00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:24,710
basically for whatever reason and

00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:26,210
replace web replace them with web forms

00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:28,580
if you so choose it requires a little

00:38:26,210 --> 00:38:32,260
bit more setup but let's say you know

00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:32,260
I'm gonna make an advanced pull here and

00:38:32,770 --> 00:38:37,100
so on the normal node page you just

00:38:35,570 --> 00:38:38,930
scroll down to the bottom and then

00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:41,570
actually start working on things so I'm

00:38:38,930 --> 00:38:44,110
gonna have like question one and say

00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:52,220
that this is a lot of select options and

00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:55,220
then have three choices probably make

00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:56,930
that required and then have a second

00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:58,640
question so normally with Paul module

00:38:56,930 --> 00:39:00,290
right you only get one question so if

00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:01,970
you had some situation where you had

00:39:00,290 --> 00:39:06,460
multiple questions this would be a good

00:39:01,970 --> 00:39:06,460
a good choice or a good option

00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:20,090
and then again make it required okay

00:39:16,970 --> 00:39:22,630
so now we've got form that has two

00:39:20,090 --> 00:39:25,250
questions now select one select another

00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:28,670
you know and then it I'm just populating

00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:31,040
it with some data and then when I go and

00:39:28,670 --> 00:39:32,840
look at the webform results on this

00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:34,460
analysis page you immediately get the

00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:35,060
charts that are for each one of those

00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:36,530
things

00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:38,930
apparently I selected the same thing

00:39:36,530 --> 00:39:41,180
twice or something that was very

00:39:38,930 --> 00:39:43,520
exciting but anyway so we've got Church

00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:44,900
for each one of those things and just

00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:48,230
like before I like we can customize

00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:52,580
these charts to make them however style

00:39:48,230 --> 00:39:54,950
or whatever we want and then save the

00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:57,320
configuration of that chart so now we've

00:39:54,950 --> 00:40:00,100
got two charts right there and then what

00:39:57,320 --> 00:40:03,050
we can do is we can go to the

00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:04,640
configuration page for this overall form

00:40:03,050 --> 00:40:06,440
so we've got this confirmation message

00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:09,200
which if you leave blank it just says

00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:11,200
you know thanks for contacting us but if

00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:13,910
we wanted to we could populate this

00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:15,350
using the token browser so if you enable

00:40:13,910 --> 00:40:18,740
the token module then you get this

00:40:15,350 --> 00:40:21,800
browser and under the nodes section

00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:22,310
there's a section in here for webform

00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:26,180
charts

00:40:22,310 --> 00:40:27,800
now so you can enter in a token here for

00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:30,320
the webform charts unfortunately you

00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:34,940
have to populate the key manually so

00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:37,840
this is based on the key from the from

00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:37,840
the component that we set up

00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:48,339
so make a message of some kind and then

00:40:46,450 --> 00:40:50,920
have tokens for each one of those

00:40:48,339 --> 00:40:54,609
individual charts for example make sure

00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:57,190
got that right okay looks looks okay so

00:40:54,609 --> 00:40:59,080
now when we go back here and we fill out

00:40:57,190 --> 00:41:02,020
these individual choices when we submit

00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:03,730
these things in the hit submit you know

00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:04,960
we get this nice thing you know thanks

00:41:03,730 --> 00:41:07,240
for voting here are the current results

00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:10,270
and then basically you get the results

00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:11,950
of the the results of the poll right

00:41:10,270 --> 00:41:15,460
there in line on the confirmation page

00:41:11,950 --> 00:41:17,589
so pretty neat option as an alternative

00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:20,050
to polls definitely much more

00:41:17,589 --> 00:41:22,420
sophisticated you still get all the

00:41:20,050 --> 00:41:24,460
recording of things but much more

00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:27,670
flexible in its configuration and how

00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:29,859
how you treat it so that's all I've got

00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:32,920
for this this set of examples but now

00:41:29,859 --> 00:41:34,450
I'm gonna move on to a second one so

00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:37,359
this second example that I've set up is

00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:39,580
all about multiple pages and conditional

00:41:37,359 --> 00:41:43,839
options so some of the new things that

00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:46,270
we can do in webform 4th so right now

00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:48,700
the way this form is set up is it's a

00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:51,520
form that has a bunch of components that

00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:55,119
are all individually listed out here and

00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:57,849
it's got three pages so right now if I

00:41:55,119 --> 00:42:00,880
were to fill out this form I have some

00:41:57,849 --> 00:42:03,400
conditional options set up here so on

00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:05,830
the first page I have this question for

00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:08,230
a course bringing and then it's got a

00:42:05,830 --> 00:42:09,820
set of different options here so whether

00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:12,640
or not its main course appetizers

00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:14,890
dessert or whatever and then if that

00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:17,770
option is selected then I'm going to

00:42:14,890 --> 00:42:20,440
show another field sort of that matches

00:42:17,770 --> 00:42:21,910
that individual thing and if you were to

00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:24,099
add another thing you can see here like

00:42:21,910 --> 00:42:26,200
the interface here for selecting these

00:42:24,099 --> 00:42:29,080
things is actually I think really pretty

00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:34,510
nice where when you select an individual

00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:36,339
thing it gives you relevant conditionals

00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:38,560
so like for dates for example you can

00:42:36,339 --> 00:42:40,270
say like before after something so if

00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:41,830
user enters a day before some date or

00:42:40,270 --> 00:42:44,230
after some date then you can show fields

00:42:41,830 --> 00:42:46,660
or if it's a lot a select list it'll

00:42:44,230 --> 00:42:48,280
show you the select lists or if it's

00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:50,230
just a text field then it will it'll

00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:53,260
give you a text field for for matching

00:42:50,230 --> 00:42:56,390
the individual thing so getting this

00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:58,430
back to where we started here

00:42:56,390 --> 00:43:01,220
so right now we've got a single page or

00:42:58,430 --> 00:43:06,109
a multiple page form and when you fill

00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:10,460
it out sure you know barbecue on

00:43:06,109 --> 00:43:11,930
September 30th and then you know you're

00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:13,130
gonna say I'm gonna bring a main course

00:43:11,930 --> 00:43:16,010
and I'm going to bring some appetizers

00:43:13,130 --> 00:43:17,390
and this is also got selector other

00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:21,020
module turned on so if you were to

00:43:17,390 --> 00:43:21,820
select oh never mind he doesn't forget I

00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:24,859
said that

00:43:21,820 --> 00:43:28,580
all right so because I've select main

00:43:24,859 --> 00:43:30,530
course and appetizers then I've got

00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:32,210
these get these options here where the

00:43:30,530 --> 00:43:33,740
main course options are shown and then

00:43:32,210 --> 00:43:34,970
the appetizers option is shown and

00:43:33,740 --> 00:43:35,630
actually here's where I was thinking

00:43:34,970 --> 00:43:37,220
about that

00:43:35,630 --> 00:43:38,720
all right you don't know if your main

00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:41,119
course I don't know you're gonna bring

00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:46,760
bacon as the main course and then

00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:49,220
appetizers sure and so what that has

00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:51,890
done basically well if I were to go back

00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:53,480
here and say oh actually you know I'm

00:43:51,890 --> 00:43:55,910
not bringing appetizers England brain

00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:57,710
dessert and then go on to the next page

00:43:55,910 --> 00:43:59,420
will happen is the appetizers field will

00:43:57,710 --> 00:44:01,310
disappear the dessert field is there

00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:03,500
instead so that's the conditional logic

00:44:01,310 --> 00:44:05,570
actually in action here if you were to

00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:08,119
do something like this field isn't

00:44:05,570 --> 00:44:10,460
actually required if you were to say I'm

00:44:08,119 --> 00:44:12,170
not bringing anything then that entire

00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:14,359
page webform is smart enough to just

00:44:12,170 --> 00:44:15,770
skip the entire page it will check all

00:44:14,359 --> 00:44:17,510
of the individual fields and if there

00:44:15,770 --> 00:44:19,010
are no fields left that match any

00:44:17,510 --> 00:44:21,950
conditions then it will skip the page

00:44:19,010 --> 00:44:23,570
entirely which is pretty smart and then

00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:24,800
if you have previous page it's also

00:44:23,570 --> 00:44:26,480
smart enough to know that there's still

00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:29,180
nothing there so it'll skip back over

00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:31,010
the page when it goes backwards so let's

00:44:29,180 --> 00:44:35,800
say I'm going to bring you know it still

00:44:31,010 --> 00:44:38,240
remembers this thing and then you know

00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:41,000
send some comments and then send it in

00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:43,609
there so this is the new functionality

00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:45,589
though is that you could do this sort of

00:44:43,609 --> 00:44:47,000
thing in webform 3 but it was a lot more

00:44:45,589 --> 00:44:49,430
complicated to set up because the

00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:51,170
conditionals were a hassle but now in

00:44:49,430 --> 00:44:53,570
web form for you can just delete this

00:44:51,170 --> 00:44:55,880
page break in between if you wanted to

00:44:53,570 --> 00:44:57,650
I'll just delete both of them just to

00:44:55,880 --> 00:45:00,800
make it so this is all like a single

00:44:57,650 --> 00:45:02,589
page form now and now with a single page

00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:05,330
form you can see here that it's just

00:45:02,589 --> 00:45:07,220
name and then the date and then the

00:45:05,330 --> 00:45:09,140
course bringing in the comments but when

00:45:07,220 --> 00:45:09,950
you check these individual things you

00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:11,900
get that field

00:45:09,950 --> 00:45:14,060
showing or hiding on the same page so

00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:15,890
and you can be pretty sophisticated

00:45:14,060 --> 00:45:18,500
about it like this appetizers field is

00:45:15,890 --> 00:45:21,260
required if it's shown but if it's not

00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:23,599
shown like if you uncheck that and then

00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:25,010
submit the form anyway it doesn't have

00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:27,320
so you about the fact that that hidden

00:45:25,010 --> 00:45:29,329
required field wasn't filled out so it's

00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:32,800
smart enough to only require field if

00:45:29,329 --> 00:45:35,450
it's actually used which is pretty cool

00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:38,420
let's see and then I go one last example

00:45:35,450 --> 00:45:40,550
here so all of those other examples

00:45:38,420 --> 00:45:43,490
those are all mostly web form

00:45:40,550 --> 00:45:46,790
out-of-the-box with web form charts and

00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:49,099
select or other if you want to really

00:45:46,790 --> 00:45:51,020
ease the burden on your form builders if

00:45:49,099 --> 00:45:53,000
you're gonna be building a site that has

00:45:51,020 --> 00:45:55,250
a whole bunch of forms you might

00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:57,349
consider turning on the form builder

00:45:55,250 --> 00:45:59,720
module so the form builder module is a

00:45:57,349 --> 00:46:01,760
separate project and what the form

00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:04,190
builder module does well it replaces

00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:06,130
this page this interface so instead of

00:46:04,190 --> 00:46:09,859
having this components page like this

00:46:06,130 --> 00:46:11,570
where you've got to sort of go through

00:46:09,859 --> 00:46:15,349
and do all of these individual pages all

00:46:11,570 --> 00:46:17,119
at one at a time if you turn on the form

00:46:15,349 --> 00:46:19,190
builder module and the form builder

00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:25,220
webform you.why module that comes with

00:46:19,190 --> 00:46:27,560
it then that page then becomes something

00:46:25,220 --> 00:46:29,810
entirely different so this is the same

00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:32,000
page on the web form tab only now it's

00:46:29,810 --> 00:46:34,369
it's given the form builder interface as

00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:36,680
the same functionality as web form only

00:46:34,369 --> 00:46:39,800
now when you want to do things like add

00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:42,200
a select field or a text list you can

00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:44,990
just drag it in change the list of

00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:48,290
options so again this is options element

00:46:44,990 --> 00:46:51,410
and as you're changing these things you

00:46:48,290 --> 00:46:54,800
can do things like you know set the size

00:46:51,410 --> 00:46:57,470
to something smaller prefix suffix I

00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:59,420
mean this doesn't make any sense make it

00:46:57,470 --> 00:47:01,700
required and you can see that like as

00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:04,339
I'm doing this it's Ajax updating it at

00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:06,829
the same time and then you can bulk edit

00:47:04,339 --> 00:47:08,839
the entire form all at once and then

00:47:06,829 --> 00:47:12,020
when you're done go down here and save

00:47:08,839 --> 00:47:13,819
and then you've sort of bulk modified

00:47:12,020 --> 00:47:17,060
the form all at once using form builder

00:47:13,819 --> 00:47:19,250
so form builder really great great

00:47:17,060 --> 00:47:21,890
project it's really easy to set up in

00:47:19,250 --> 00:47:23,610
Drupal 7 because Drupal 7 includes

00:47:21,890 --> 00:47:25,950
jQuery UI built into core

00:47:23,610 --> 00:47:27,620
so it uses jQuery UI to basically add

00:47:25,950 --> 00:47:30,360
all of that drag and drop functionality

00:47:27,620 --> 00:47:36,230
without adding any external libraries or

00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:38,550
anything so I think as far as this

00:47:36,230 --> 00:47:40,470
hands-on stuff goes that that's pretty

00:47:38,550 --> 00:47:42,060
much it for that I think we're ready to

00:47:40,470 --> 00:47:44,040
move on to questions is there a

00:47:42,060 --> 00:47:47,460
moderator with a microphone in the room

00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:48,630
by chance no okay in that case you're

00:47:47,460 --> 00:47:51,690
just gonna have to shout the question

00:47:48,630 --> 00:47:55,760
really loud and then I'll repeat it for

00:47:51,690 --> 00:47:55,760
everybody else so yeah

00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:10,750
okay yeah okay so the question was is

00:48:07,780 --> 00:48:13,359
the data that is saved

00:48:10,750 --> 00:48:15,339
is it still split into web form data and

00:48:13,359 --> 00:48:17,260
web form submissions yeah there's still

00:48:15,339 --> 00:48:19,450
the same two database tables that there

00:48:17,260 --> 00:48:21,670
were before where the web form

00:48:19,450 --> 00:48:23,980
submissions like a list of submissions

00:48:21,670 --> 00:48:26,619
is stored in one table and then all of

00:48:23,980 --> 00:48:28,720
the data for all of the web forms all

00:48:26,619 --> 00:48:31,720
combined is all in another table so it's

00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:35,589
a really simple database schema but the

00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:38,109
views integration it whenever you make a

00:48:35,589 --> 00:48:39,550
listing of webform submissions in order

00:48:38,109 --> 00:48:42,359
to pull out the data you have to add a

00:48:39,550 --> 00:48:45,430
relationship to pull out the individual

00:48:42,359 --> 00:48:47,140
fields basically and the relationship

00:48:45,430 --> 00:48:48,280
Naples you to do things like filters and

00:48:47,140 --> 00:48:51,040
sorts and things like that so basically

00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:53,170
does it join on the data table for every

00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:55,030
sort or filter that you need so if you

00:48:53,170 --> 00:48:57,579
have three sorts or three filters then

00:48:55,030 --> 00:48:58,869
it joins the table three times yeah so

00:48:57,579 --> 00:49:01,000
it makes us say you have all the same

00:48:58,869 --> 00:49:03,099
capabilities as you would normally fuse

00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:05,200
but a really simplified data structure

00:49:03,099 --> 00:49:07,960
for better or worse like it scales

00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:10,150
better but at the same time it's not

00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:15,990
quite as robust when it comes to

00:49:10,150 --> 00:49:15,990
displaying the results yeah over here

00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:32,760
oh yeah okay so what about what about

00:49:28,710 --> 00:49:34,440
Drupal 8 which is a great question so we

00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:37,440
have a plan for porting Montour porting

00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:38,970
webform to Drupal 8 there's a team of

00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:40,380
people that are interested in importing

00:49:38,970 --> 00:49:43,230
it right now

00:49:40,380 --> 00:49:44,880
two new contributors that then I'm not

00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:47,160
actually familiar with but I've already

00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:48,690
created them maintainer shapour the

00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:51,780
project so they're starting to port it

00:49:48,690 --> 00:49:53,820
right now and I also know that Chris

00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:55,530
VandeWater Eclipse GC is also expressed

00:49:53,820 --> 00:49:59,220
some interest in maintaining it so I

00:49:55,530 --> 00:50:01,320
think that yeah Drupal 8 will definitely

00:49:59,220 --> 00:50:03,360
have a future but I'm not really sure

00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:05,250
like you know what Drupal 8 still being

00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:06,390
heavily developed right now I'm pretty

00:50:05,250 --> 00:50:11,070
sure that it's kind of a long way out

00:50:06,390 --> 00:50:26,190
yet from Laporte is that a question no

00:50:11,070 --> 00:50:27,780
use yeah okay so didn't we make any

00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:30,000
improvements about creating and

00:50:27,780 --> 00:50:31,440
modifying web forms programmatically do

00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:34,610
you have any specific examples of what

00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:34,610
was difficult in webform 3

00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:14,500
okay yeah so okay so is it possible to

00:51:12,460 --> 00:51:28,780
individually like unit tests the

00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:32,080
submissions okay yeah programmatically

00:51:28,780 --> 00:51:33,520
creating a webform so I wouldn't say

00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:35,230
that it's actually changed hardly at all

00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:36,820
from from webform three but I don't

00:51:35,230 --> 00:51:40,000
think that it's particularly difficult

00:51:36,820 --> 00:51:41,620
to actually test it's it's just that

00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:43,540
what you really have to think about web

00:51:41,620 --> 00:51:44,650
forms from a Content perspective which I

00:51:43,540 --> 00:51:47,260
know is kind of difficult because it

00:51:44,650 --> 00:51:49,510
feels like site building but web forms

00:51:47,260 --> 00:51:51,370
model of web forms basically being nodes

00:51:49,510 --> 00:51:53,470
means that you can treat them like nodes

00:51:51,370 --> 00:51:55,570
even when it comes to creating them and

00:51:53,470 --> 00:51:57,880
updating them that all you really need

00:51:55,570 --> 00:52:00,130
to do is build out a stub node object

00:51:57,880 --> 00:52:02,680
and then called node save on it and that

00:52:00,130 --> 00:52:04,120
will create the associated webform or if

00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:06,370
you want to update a webform

00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:09,520
load the node out of the database and

00:52:06,370 --> 00:52:11,530
then the node object node arrow webform

00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:13,360
contains the entire webform

00:52:11,530 --> 00:52:15,970
configuration all of the conditionals

00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:17,680
even the chart configuration and then

00:52:15,970 --> 00:52:19,180
you can modify any of those those

00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:21,310
settings and then call note save and

00:52:19,180 --> 00:52:24,670
then you've updated the form actually

00:52:21,310 --> 00:52:26,050
testing those in like simple tests or

00:52:24,670 --> 00:52:27,940
something like that

00:52:26,050 --> 00:52:29,650
webform includes actually its own

00:52:27,940 --> 00:52:31,210
testing suite which I'm not sure if you

00:52:29,650 --> 00:52:34,090
if you've looked at before but it does

00:52:31,210 --> 00:52:36,850
exactly that where it tests by creating

00:52:34,090 --> 00:52:38,860
forms via a large array basically

00:52:36,850 --> 00:52:40,750
calling notes save on it and then it

00:52:38,860 --> 00:52:43,510
uses a web test of course because I

00:52:40,750 --> 00:52:45,370
really yeah there's there's no unit test

00:52:43,510 --> 00:52:47,020
ability because there's so much stuff

00:52:45,370 --> 00:52:48,370
that is all it basically is it's

00:52:47,020 --> 00:52:49,840
creating a front-end form and there's

00:52:48,370 --> 00:52:52,990
not really a poll at least any

00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:54,220
separation between the form and like

00:52:52,990 --> 00:52:57,270
there's under way to test a form

00:52:54,220 --> 00:52:57,270
programmatically really

00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:09,340
yeah so is there any documentation on

00:53:06,970 --> 00:53:14,020
the actual structure of the the webform

00:53:09,340 --> 00:53:16,420
key you know I don't think they're there

00:53:14,020 --> 00:53:18,490
specifically is documentation on how it

00:53:16,420 --> 00:53:20,470
is but it's very consistent even between

00:53:18,490 --> 00:53:23,230
webform 3 + webform 4 it's almost

00:53:20,470 --> 00:53:25,510
identical and the easiest way to go

00:53:23,230 --> 00:53:27,520
about it is to use devel module and just

00:53:25,510 --> 00:53:29,020
click the devel tab on on an on a

00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:39,670
webform node and just look at the

00:53:29,020 --> 00:53:40,960
structure that way yeah yeah maybe yeah

00:53:39,670 --> 00:53:46,420
maybe something that's more built out

00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:47,980
would be good but it's really yeah name

00:53:46,420 --> 00:53:51,700
well Devon I'm not sure that I've got it

00:53:47,980 --> 00:53:53,650
on here well I don't even have develop I

00:53:51,700 --> 00:53:55,750
wish I could just show you but it's it's

00:53:53,650 --> 00:53:58,210
really easy to inspect but yeah there's

00:53:55,750 --> 00:54:00,640
no hard documentation but we could

00:53:58,210 --> 00:54:03,220
because I mean it's a very consistent

00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:04,690
structure and we don't change it for

00:54:03,220 --> 00:54:07,510
because if you did change it you'd be

00:54:04,690 --> 00:54:14,590
breaking the API so it's it's it's very

00:54:07,510 --> 00:54:18,490
consistent though yes will it support

00:54:14,590 --> 00:54:21,550
multilingual okay so multilingual stuff

00:54:18,490 --> 00:54:23,230
with webform is historically very

00:54:21,550 --> 00:54:26,200
challenging actually there's a module

00:54:23,230 --> 00:54:29,520
called webform localization which is the

00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:33,190
best stab at it thus far webform

00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:35,650
attempts to make it possible or at least

00:54:33,190 --> 00:54:37,750
it tries to inform translation systems

00:54:35,650 --> 00:54:39,760
about all of the possible things that

00:54:37,750 --> 00:54:42,280
could possibly be configured like you

00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:44,380
want to translate the label of a form or

00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:46,180
the label of a field and the description

00:54:44,380 --> 00:54:48,100
of a field and the placeholder of a

00:54:46,180 --> 00:54:49,360
field but you don't necessarily want to

00:54:48,100 --> 00:54:51,640
translate like whether or not it's

00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:53,620
required that wouldn't make any sense so

00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:55,120
web form already exposes that

00:54:53,620 --> 00:54:57,850
information about what stuff is

00:54:55,120 --> 00:55:00,720
translatable and what stuff isn't but

00:54:57,850 --> 00:55:02,980
there isn't actually in a UI around

00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:05,650
configuring any that are around

00:55:02,980 --> 00:55:08,230
translating it so it sort of outsources

00:55:05,650 --> 00:55:10,510
that like most modules do unfortunately

00:55:08,230 --> 00:55:13,330
to another to another module to actually

00:55:10,510 --> 00:55:15,130
deal with the translation I would

00:55:13,330 --> 00:55:16,690
imagine Drupal 8 there's

00:55:15,130 --> 00:55:19,000
a little bit premature because porting

00:55:16,690 --> 00:55:21,850
hasn't actually begun yet but I imagine

00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:24,580
in Drupal 8 what would be a natural fit

00:55:21,850 --> 00:55:26,740
for webform is that we would actually

00:55:24,580 --> 00:55:29,260
move web forms most likely to

00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:32,560
configuration so we would use llamó

00:55:29,260 --> 00:55:34,450
files to represent the configuration of

00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:36,640
an individual web form and just bind a

00:55:34,450 --> 00:55:38,890
web form to a node so it would still

00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:41,410
kind of act the same but in the process

00:55:38,890 --> 00:55:43,540
instead of generating like something

00:55:41,410 --> 00:55:44,590
that is part of the node as content you

00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:46,570
would actually be generating

00:55:44,590 --> 00:55:49,650
configuration and the reason why we

00:55:46,570 --> 00:55:52,690
would want to do that is because of the

00:55:49,650 --> 00:55:55,060
configuration translation ability like

00:55:52,690 --> 00:55:56,830
if you went to gabor x' session earlier

00:55:55,060 --> 00:55:59,800
today which was amazing when he showed

00:55:56,830 --> 00:56:03,280
like how the translate tab on individual

00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:05,680
like settings pages in theory as if as

00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:07,870
long as web forms were configuration

00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:09,820
that would automatically become

00:56:07,870 --> 00:56:11,530
available if that feature happens in

00:56:09,820 --> 00:56:13,720
Drupal 8 and web forms are used as

00:56:11,530 --> 00:56:14,710
configuration then both of those things

00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:16,300
combined would just kind of

00:56:14,710 --> 00:56:21,720
automatically give you that which would

00:56:16,300 --> 00:56:21,720
be great any other yeah

00:56:37,509 --> 00:56:42,710
okay so the question was is it possible

00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:45,829
to combine web forms with other forms

00:56:42,710 --> 00:56:48,799
like the user registration form and make

00:56:45,829 --> 00:56:51,650
them sort of all combined it all

00:56:48,799 --> 00:56:55,400
together I wouldn't say that it's very

00:56:51,650 --> 00:56:58,670
easy at all actually I think the only

00:56:55,400 --> 00:57:00,289
way you could probably manage that well

00:56:58,670 --> 00:57:01,999
a couple of different ways you can make

00:57:00,289 --> 00:57:04,730
a custom web form component for like

00:57:01,999 --> 00:57:06,680
registration so web form has the ability

00:57:04,730 --> 00:57:08,599
have pluggable fields just like field

00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:10,430
module does and you can make a field

00:57:08,599 --> 00:57:13,970
that specifically was like for user

00:57:10,430 --> 00:57:16,220
registration so that that's one way to

00:57:13,970 --> 00:57:19,390
tackle it but probably the easiest way

00:57:16,220 --> 00:57:22,220
to tackle it is just to cheat and take

00:57:19,390 --> 00:57:24,619
the user registration form and they're

00:57:22,220 --> 00:57:27,109
just kind of like take a web form and

00:57:24,619 --> 00:57:29,150
form alter in the user registration

00:57:27,109 --> 00:57:31,940
stuff and then add an extra submit

00:57:29,150 --> 00:57:34,069
handler on the web form so web form is

00:57:31,940 --> 00:57:35,720
very hackable in terms of form altering

00:57:34,069 --> 00:57:37,489
so you can set up the entire web form

00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:39,019
and then alter it to make a do whatever

00:57:37,489 --> 00:57:40,670
you want including combining

00:57:39,019 --> 00:57:42,410
registration at the same time and that's

00:57:40,670 --> 00:57:52,549
probably how I would tackle it in that

00:57:42,410 --> 00:57:54,670
situation any others mm-hmm what was

00:57:52,549 --> 00:57:54,670
that

00:58:01,310 --> 00:58:14,420
I sorry I really can't hear you uh-huh

00:58:09,260 --> 00:58:17,540
yeah okay gotcha okay so I mentioned

00:58:14,420 --> 00:58:20,390
using web forms as blocks can you use

00:58:17,540 --> 00:58:22,190
Ajax to submit the form when it's used

00:58:20,390 --> 00:58:28,520
as a block is that is that the whole

00:58:22,190 --> 00:58:30,110
thing okay no at least at least I don't

00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:32,090
there isn't a way to do it built out of

00:58:30,110 --> 00:58:35,090
the box I think that there are some

00:58:32,090 --> 00:58:36,650
modules like Ajax submit module and

00:58:35,090 --> 00:58:37,970
there might be like a web form Ajax

00:58:36,650 --> 00:58:41,360
module that might add that functionality

00:58:37,970 --> 00:58:43,280
but thus far we don't have any Ajax

00:58:41,360 --> 00:58:45,740
ability built into web form it could be

00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:47,330
a nice feature regardless of whether

00:58:45,740 --> 00:58:49,580
it's in a block I would think that if we

00:58:47,330 --> 00:58:51,530
added Ajax functionality we would add it

00:58:49,580 --> 00:58:53,260
pretty much everywhere I've seen it done

00:58:51,530 --> 00:58:55,640
before but I haven't actually

00:58:53,260 --> 00:58:58,310
implemented that myself so I know those

00:58:55,640 --> 00:58:59,690
add-on modules and ways to do it but off

00:58:58,310 --> 00:59:05,680
the top of my head I can't can it to

00:58:59,690 --> 00:59:05,680
that unfortunately any others yeah

00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:30,350
you

00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:36,710
I think I think I got that it was a

00:59:30,350 --> 00:59:38,720
question about oh boy using a view in a

00:59:36,710 --> 00:59:40,910
web form to like populate select lists

00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:46,430
to make a node reference for example

00:59:40,910 --> 00:59:48,860
okay gotcha yeah that's a feature that I

00:59:46,430 --> 00:59:52,690
really wish did exist so web form allows

00:59:48,860 --> 00:59:55,880
you to let's not do it with this one

00:59:52,690 --> 00:59:59,600
allows you to use pre-populated select

00:59:55,880 --> 01:00:00,920
lists in a lot of cases so on this

00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:02,510
select list for example there's an

01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:04,310
option down here for like pre-populated

01:00:02,510 --> 01:00:06,230
select lists here so you can do things

01:00:04,310 --> 01:00:08,360
like days of the week and it'll

01:00:06,230 --> 01:00:09,920
automatically populate the days of the

01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:13,100
week into the Select list and as like

01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:15,620
countries the world and and the United

01:00:13,100 --> 01:00:17,510
States basically and in theory you can

01:00:15,620 --> 01:00:19,910
put anything you want into this select

01:00:17,510 --> 01:00:22,970
list including views so you can make

01:00:19,910 --> 01:00:25,010
like a node reference thing by pop by

01:00:22,970 --> 01:00:27,200
creating a view and then using it as a

01:00:25,010 --> 01:00:29,660
pre-built select list and then you would

01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:34,400
effectively have a node reference field

01:00:29,660 --> 01:00:37,070
basically but out-of-the-box web form

01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:40,490
doesn't provide an option for reusing

01:00:37,070 --> 01:00:45,320
views as as pre-built select lists

01:00:40,490 --> 01:00:47,510
though there is a contributes me at the

01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:48,980
moment I do think that that

01:00:47,510 --> 01:00:52,130
functionality should be built into web

01:00:48,980 --> 01:00:54,980
form core though so it's it so given an

01:00:52,130 --> 01:00:57,500
opportunity I think that there's a patch

01:00:54,980 --> 01:01:00,380
in the queue that is being worked on but

01:00:57,500 --> 01:01:01,940
if that opportunity were if it were to

01:01:00,380 --> 01:01:04,460
be finished I would be more than happy

01:01:01,940 --> 01:01:05,930
to incorporate that into the project so

01:01:04,460 --> 01:01:07,640
that way we would have some semblance of

01:01:05,930 --> 01:01:09,770
like the ability to do node references

01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:13,190
or any pre-populated list based off of a

01:01:09,770 --> 01:01:20,440
view so again not not immediately

01:01:13,190 --> 01:01:20,440
available but planned and right here

01:01:23,599 --> 01:01:29,799
what was that okay

01:01:40,460 --> 01:01:47,080
gotcha okay so calculations let's say

01:01:44,300 --> 01:01:49,880
like a viewer using a spreadsheet that

01:01:47,080 --> 01:01:51,890
you know dad filled I feel B and you did

01:01:49,880 --> 01:01:53,720
I had to add them or sum them or or do

01:01:51,890 --> 01:01:57,920
something with them what I would suggest

01:01:53,720 --> 01:02:00,320
you do is views that it takes some

01:01:57,920 --> 01:02:04,160
serious views Fuu but you can totally do

01:02:00,320 --> 01:02:05,869
that with views where you can use one

01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:09,170
view that just like pulls out all of the

01:02:05,869 --> 01:02:11,300
webform submitted data and then you can

01:02:09,170 --> 01:02:13,700
add an attachment to the bottom of it

01:02:11,300 --> 01:02:16,099
and turn on aggregation which allows you

01:02:13,700 --> 01:02:18,320
to do sequel counts and sums and things

01:02:16,099 --> 01:02:20,930
like that and then you can take the data

01:02:18,320 --> 01:02:23,119
from your view and then in the

01:02:20,930 --> 01:02:25,550
attachment do the aggregates so you can

01:02:23,119 --> 01:02:27,560
counter sum or average or or do anything

01:02:25,550 --> 01:02:29,330
you want all through views and because

01:02:27,560 --> 01:02:31,820
web form now exposes all of its data to

01:02:29,330 --> 01:02:33,020
views you can now use views aggregate

01:02:31,820 --> 01:02:36,230
functions to calculate all that

01:02:33,020 --> 01:02:37,640
information in a view so yeah totally

01:02:36,230 --> 01:02:40,160
works its really neat actually and then

01:02:37,640 --> 01:02:41,780
you could take those that charts module

01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:43,280
that I showed you also has full views

01:02:41,780 --> 01:02:45,680
integration so then you can take all of

01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:47,660
that chart information and you can do

01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:49,040
like submissions per day or whatever you

01:02:47,660 --> 01:02:52,280
want you can chart you can chart all of

01:02:49,040 --> 01:02:55,070
that stuff so I I think we're all out of

01:02:52,280 --> 01:02:59,740
time so thank you guys so much for

01:02:55,070 --> 01:02:59,740
