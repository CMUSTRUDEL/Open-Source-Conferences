Title: DrupalCon Prague 2013: DRUPAL 8 DEPLOYMENT AND CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION
Publication date: 2013-09-26
Playlist: DrupalCon Prague - September 2013
Description: 
	Up until D7, continuous integration has been a luxury for most Drupal projects. It is really hard to implement and the underlying Drupal architecture simply was not built with continuous integration in mind.

One of the biggest issues developers face during deployment in D7 is configuration management. With the new features being developed for D8 under the Configuration Management Initiative, lots of these issues should be resolved.

In this session we will explore some of the benefits and advantages you get from implementing CI, check some examples of workflows and tools and see how far D8 got in terms of improving deployment and continuous integration practices.
