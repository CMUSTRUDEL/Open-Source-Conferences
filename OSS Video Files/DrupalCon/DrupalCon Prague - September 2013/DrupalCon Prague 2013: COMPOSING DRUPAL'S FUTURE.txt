Title: DrupalCon Prague 2013: COMPOSING DRUPAL'S FUTURE
Publication date: 2013-09-26
Playlist: DrupalCon Prague - September 2013
Description: 
	Composer is a PHP Dependency Management tool. Drupal 8 has already embraced it by fulfilling dependencies such as Symfony components, Guzzle, Doctrine & more through Composer. With the advent of PSR-0 autoloading & the increasingly componentizable nature of php, Drupal 8 has begun to provide components of its own that could stand separate from the Drupal code base.

Come see how these components could give benefit to the entire Drupal community by spreading the influence of our code and our culture into the greater PHP world. This session will outline both the current state of Drupal components & what a possible future of Drupal components could look like.
