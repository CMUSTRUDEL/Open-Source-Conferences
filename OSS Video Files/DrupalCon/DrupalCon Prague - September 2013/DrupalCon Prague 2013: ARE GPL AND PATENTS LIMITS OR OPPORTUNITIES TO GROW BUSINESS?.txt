Title: DrupalCon Prague 2013: ARE GPL AND PATENTS LIMITS OR OPPORTUNITIES TO GROW BUSINESS?
Publication date: 2013-09-26
Playlist: DrupalCon Prague - September 2013
Description: 
	This talk is about the two most important intellectual property (IP) topics with open source: the GPL license and software patents. They are often seen as complete opposites, and many hold strong opinions about them. GPL is a cancer! Kill all patents! This talk gets us back to the basics: what is the state of GPL and patents today, and how do they affect software based businesses including everyone making their living in the Drupal community. It is very true GPL makes it difficult to create scalable software licensing business. At the same time GPL can help make a platform truly popular and you can innovate around its business limitations. Third party software patents can make you feel uncertain to add a certain feature. At the same time patent threats are rarely any problem for smaller companies. When you are ready, filing and licensing patents can give you an edge against competition and actually get your business to the next level.

	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,700
so good morning everybody I think it's a

00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:09,960
15 to 11 and we can start thank you for

00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:11,639
everyone coming to this room I

00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,929
understand this is a busy event there's

00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:16,170
a lot of people here a lot of

00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:19,230
interesting sessions I also want to

00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:21,600
thank yon the color from X of a who

00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:25,500
invited me here into this event and I'm

00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:29,300
very happy to be be around and have this

00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:35,730
short talk so I was asked to talk about

00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:37,620
legal issues today and about the

00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:40,770
interaction between legal stuff and

00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:43,290
business stuff and that's what I'm going

00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:45,690
to talk about I have two main topics

00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:49,079
here you have them here I'm talking

00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:52,730
about GPL license how does that affect

00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:56,789
business and I'm talking about patterns

00:00:52,730 --> 00:01:01,079
just to two issues here today something

00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:03,180
my background first so I'm actually not

00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:05,610
part of this community like I believe

00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:08,810
most of you guys are this is my first

00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:11,549
time in a Drupal event I'm really

00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:15,000
surprised how big these communities and

00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:17,880
how active it seems to be I've been

00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,740
working with the many open-source

00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:21,900
projects in the past not just with

00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:25,979
Drupal I started like over 10 years ago

00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:29,159
as a consultant maybe the first project

00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:30,990
icon solid was a MySQL database back

00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:35,549
then there was no company even for the

00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:39,420
project late 1990s I have my own

00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:43,380
companies as well I've done database

00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:46,710
applications music these streaming

00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:48,930
services latest company I'm having for

00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:51,960
the last almost five years already it's

00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:53,579
called took Sarah this talk is not an

00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:56,219
advertisement of talks are in any way

00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:58,020
and what I do in these companies is not

00:01:56,219 --> 00:01:59,640
related to Drupal also but it's a

00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:03,899
software company we do file system

00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:06,270
software Linux system software based on

00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:08,250
open source and now we are doing it in a

00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:09,959
commercial fashion and we have to also

00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:12,510
in our company took Sarah we have to

00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:14,400
deal with GPL and patterns every day and

00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:19,200
we have to figure out

00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:24,180
how can we use this licensing and patent

00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:27,299
stuff as our benefit and not not as the

00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:29,670
limit for our business so okay many

00:02:27,299 --> 00:02:32,519
things I talk about today may not

00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:34,799
exactly apply apply in your context and

00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:35,579
your situation and you hope understand

00:02:34,799 --> 00:02:37,230
that I'm coming from different

00:02:35,579 --> 00:02:40,170
background but also hopefully i can

00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:43,760
offer you some new perspectives okay

00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:43,760
let's start that was the disclaimer

00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:51,750
there's two part of my presentation

00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:53,159
first is kind of the challenges part and

00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:55,170
then there's the opportunities part

00:02:53,159 --> 00:03:01,920
challenges what challenges you have with

00:02:55,170 --> 00:03:06,030
GPL and patterns here you have it GPL

00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:07,859
license version 2 section 2 B you

00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:09,780
probably all have heard about this maybe

00:03:07,859 --> 00:03:12,329
some of you have even read this part

00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:14,400
from the license the wording is a little

00:03:12,329 --> 00:03:16,079
bit different tip universe and tree but

00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:19,829
the principle is the same it's called

00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:23,430
copy left you must go see any work that

00:03:19,829 --> 00:03:25,169
you distribute published that in whole

00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:28,319
or in part contest or is derived from

00:03:25,169 --> 00:03:30,750
the program or any part thereof the

00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:33,269
license as a whole at no charge free of

00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:37,079
charge well third parties under the

00:03:33,269 --> 00:03:41,720
terms of the license what does this mean

00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:44,519
can you do software business anymore of

00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:47,280
course if you develop a website you know

00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:49,470
with most likely doesn't affect you you

00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,979
are not doing traditional software

00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:54,959
however if you think about the possible

00:03:52,979 --> 00:03:58,290
business impossible things you could do

00:03:54,959 --> 00:04:01,169
for example with with the Drupal this

00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:02,819
certainly does affect what you can do if

00:04:01,169 --> 00:04:07,199
you want to make a business out of what

00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:09,359
you do you can start just you know

00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:10,739
closed-source Drupal make some extension

00:04:09,359 --> 00:04:15,269
start selling the whole thing it's

00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:17,639
against GPL you have to take a little

00:04:15,269 --> 00:04:19,500
bit deeper and figure out how to how to

00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:22,549
get away from this limitation if this is

00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,549
the limitation for your business

00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:30,070
but this is really important part is the

00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:33,450
key part of GP Eliza's and it affects

00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:36,070
everybody working with GPS software

00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:39,430
including everybody working working with

00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:41,440
drupal one more thing I'd like to say

00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:43,330
about the GPL versus tree I understand

00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:45,610
RuPaul is license with GPL versus two

00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:48,130
person two or later so you can choose if

00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:50,980
you want to have GPL version 2 or person

00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:54,760
tree if you have the choice or you need

00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:57,280
to make a choice in some context how I

00:04:54,760 --> 00:05:00,520
see licensing in this let's say IT

00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:03,280
industry in general many companies have

00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:06,100
internal policies against GPL version 3

00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:10,110
is not good for them many companies

00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:13,060
today and I believe in the future I

00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:17,050
don't think JPL vs. version tree has

00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:19,990
been a great success from business

00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:22,450
perspective for many communities and

00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:26,320
community developers it is probably very

00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:28,120
much good and okay but let's say the big

00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:30,970
businesses have been very careful in

00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:34,270
adopting GPL version 3 so if you have a

00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:36,220
customer asking what version of GPL this

00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:38,040
thing has been licensed with you make a

00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:40,600
local installation for your customer

00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:42,010
most likely used to dance too cheap your

00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:45,480
version too if you don't know what to

00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:47,980
answer that's at least what I would say

00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:54,040
cheaper version tree can be can be seen

00:05:47,980 --> 00:06:00,460
as soon as a trade another major

00:05:54,040 --> 00:06:03,670
challenge here is a 1 a patent document

00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:06,790
retrieve it from a European Patent

00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:08,080
database there's a lot of patterns you

00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:11,110
have probably heard about them read

00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:13,600
about them on online and maybe sometimes

00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:17,140
even bumped your patent claim Italian

00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:19,390
thread these particular pattern there's

00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:22,210
millions of them you can see the number

00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:24,430
somewhere application number it counts

00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:28,780
in millions these days tens of millions

00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:31,900
these days date of filing 90 for a long

00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:34,650
time ago common names based for long and

00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:37,100
short filenames this is one of those

00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:43,610
almost legendary

00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:46,070
80 fat file system patterns this is a

00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:48,230
really valuable pattern this pattern has

00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:50,870
been litigated many many times in course

00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:52,970
it has been found valid Microsoft has

00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:55,940
been litigating against a lot of these

00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:57,950
android phone manufacturers based on

00:06:55,940 --> 00:07:01,670
this pattern and they have been

00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:05,240
successful a lot of patterns like that

00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:07,280
in very many different areas of IT you

00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:09,290
can you can browse the parent databases

00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:12,890
commentaries on them a lot of blogs

00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:15,110
right about these patterns and yeah you

00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:17,570
should be aware patterns exist and

00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:19,610
sometimes they may actually bump into

00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:21,560
what you are doing and actually okay

00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:23,150
little bit about what we do in our

00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:25,250
companies that we are actually working

00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:26,600
in this particle of file system context

00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:28,640
and these kind of parents are really

00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:31,370
important for our business we have to

00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:33,490
take care care about these patterns the

00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:37,160
good news is that you can you can you

00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:38,660
can work still even if parents do exist

00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:43,400
you just have to contact the patent

00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:45,020
owner and figure something out okay one

00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:48,860
more thing about these patterns is that

00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:51,290
them there's been this ongoing debate in

00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:53,540
division in Europe about software

00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:55,100
patterns and especially many community

00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:57,920
developers have been thinking that ok

00:07:55,100 --> 00:08:00,670
patterns don't exist in Europe but this

00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:02,690
is not true it absolutely is not true

00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:06,980
basically the same patterns that are

00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:09,920
valid in the US have been you know also

00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:11,540
successfully litigated in European

00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:14,050
course this is one example this fat

00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:16,760
pattern this is exactly the same patent

00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:19,370
registered in the United States and in

00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:22,480
Europe litigated in the United States

00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:31,370
and in Europe and successfully enforced

00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:33,200
in both places okay one more challenge

00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:36,310
ahead maybe you have patterns ahead if

00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:40,550
you do business and become successful oh

00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:42,860
there's a lot of text here this is what

00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:46,370
gps says about patterns but this might

00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:49,910
be also relevant from t plus version to

00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:50,840
the main point here is that the you know

00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:52,370
the couple left

00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:53,960
suppose you can charge anything and you

00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:58,220
have to be able to distribute it for

00:08:53,960 --> 00:09:01,610
everybody if there are patterns GPL

00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:03,440
version 2 says GPL version 3 goes even a

00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:06,590
little bit further cheaper version 2

00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:10,430
says you can be stably suffer anymore if

00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:13,900
there are patterns which are out there

00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:18,500
and somebody asked royalties for those

00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:22,400
if as a consequence even somebody

00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:24,440
alleges patent infringement conditions

00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:26,990
are imposed on you some Prius royalties

00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:29,480
that contradict the conditions in this

00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:31,430
GPL license meaning totally free

00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:34,640
redistribution somebody as patent

00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:38,210
royalties they do not excuse you from

00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:40,460
GPL and as a consequence you may not

00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:44,540
distribute the program this cheap your

00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:46,310
program at all somebody comes out and

00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:50,540
says hey Drupal inferences 10 of our

00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:53,150
patterns they are here we are throughout

00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:57,650
this for this does it mean your Drupal

00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:59,930
business is over you read this text

00:09:57,650 --> 00:10:09,140
maybe this is a this is a valid concern

00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:13,250
maybe it's a valid concern just one

00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:15,800
example here a company that there are

00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:17,840
many of these that I just go boldly

00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:20,290
where they they want to go to has

00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:22,820
anybody here heard of this yola company

00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:24,380
all the fiends have heard panocha

00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:26,690
understand that not not many other other

00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:28,130
other guys have heard about it so back

00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:30,470
in the day there was this company called

00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:32,030
nokia in finland and they were

00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:34,600
developing a linux-based operating

00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:37,130
system for their phones called me go

00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:39,260
they canceled a couple years ago switch

00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:41,450
to Microsoft Windows and now the whole

00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:42,830
business has been sold to Microsoft but

00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:44,360
when they were still strong they david

00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:45,980
lee no space to operating system they

00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:47,690
canceled that and the guys who were

00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:49,490
developing in front of their own company

00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:52,640
called yola and actually now they plan

00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:55,250
to publish the first yola phone end of

00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:58,190
this year so just the company order to

00:10:55,250 --> 00:11:00,740
blue a couple of guys they want to start

00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:03,910
selling a new mobile phone based in a

00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:03,910
new little space platform

00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:08,440
this is a bold move if you think how

00:11:06,819 --> 00:11:10,240
many patterns you have in

00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:12,699
telecommunication six or and how many

00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:14,430
patterns you have affecting phones you

00:11:12,699 --> 00:11:19,180
just think about all these android

00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:22,000
lawsuits out there ok hello again a lot

00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:25,779
of text here some of the news releases i

00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,459
just found online and copied here this

00:11:25,779 --> 00:11:29,380
guy who am i I don't think he actually

00:11:27,459 --> 00:11:32,050
is anymore to CEO but he was to see you

00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:35,110
at some point of the company and he said

00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:36,670
hey this is your living space phone

00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:38,230
we're gonna sell it to everybody all

00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:40,540
over the world it's a very good choice

00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:42,819
for manufacture if you want to brand it

00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:46,329
as your own phone because we are not the

00:11:42,819 --> 00:11:48,149
affected of these patterns we are based

00:11:46,329 --> 00:11:54,579
on an independent operating system

00:11:48,149 --> 00:11:58,420
doesn't infringe patterns do you think

00:11:54,579 --> 00:12:03,639
this is a strong ground they are they

00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:05,470
are getting forward forward with I don't

00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:07,990
think this this statement is actually

00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:10,269
actually so strong you know most of

00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:13,060
these android patterns they are about

00:12:10,269 --> 00:12:15,759
the internal functions of the auto

00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:17,920
operating system and I think these your

00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:19,449
operating system most likely inference

00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:23,319
is most of the same patterns that are

00:12:19,449 --> 00:12:24,850
part of the Android lawsuits of course

00:12:23,319 --> 00:12:26,620
there are some UI patterns they don't

00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:29,769
probably infringe butter there are many

00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:32,230
others they could and just that you

00:12:29,769 --> 00:12:36,040
manufacture a phone you have to license

00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:42,360
a lot of patterns for creechies LTE and

00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:45,220
other standards on a more positive note

00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:50,100
the thing the other quotation here does

00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:53,439
from one of the famous peer-to-peer

00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:57,000
lawsuits and judgment from the united

00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:59,529
states and their the charge is asking

00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:02,860
you can generalize that do all kind of

00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:05,199
IT businesses all right somebody starts

00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:07,600
a very interesting new technology

00:13:05,199 --> 00:13:09,310
company necessary you have to infringe a

00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,649
lot of third party rights copper eyes

00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:13,480
patterns for it whatever in this case

00:13:11,649 --> 00:13:15,579
there was a massive copyright

00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:19,290
infringement on going basically the guy

00:13:15,579 --> 00:13:24,670
started the peer-to-peer network

00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:26,290
but the charts is asking hey our society

00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:29,199
needs new companies we need new

00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:31,059
businesses it looks like necessary you

00:13:29,199 --> 00:13:33,309
do inference a lot of rice when you

00:13:31,059 --> 00:13:35,499
start an innovative company how much

00:13:33,309 --> 00:13:38,499
time you get to grow big enough so you

00:13:35,499 --> 00:13:39,939
can start paying out I think that's a

00:13:38,499 --> 00:13:43,449
valid question and I think that's the

00:13:39,939 --> 00:13:45,610
right approach and I actually think that

00:13:43,449 --> 00:13:48,309
pros these guys are having in this

00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:54,160
Finnish company the mobile phone company

00:13:48,309 --> 00:13:56,139
I like that attitude maybe they know the

00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:58,749
patterns exist they don't exactly know

00:13:56,139 --> 00:14:03,309
where they apply to let's just go ahead

00:13:58,749 --> 00:14:04,739
they see what happens I think that's the

00:14:03,309 --> 00:14:06,910
way we should start thinking about this

00:14:04,739 --> 00:14:09,009
difficult copyright and patent questions

00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:15,100
and that brings me to the opportunity

00:14:09,009 --> 00:14:20,259
part so how do you deal with the GPL and

00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:22,269
patterns let's start with this GPL so

00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:24,369
there was this issue that uh how can you

00:14:22,269 --> 00:14:31,149
build a business patient GPL that makes

00:14:24,369 --> 00:14:34,360
everything free free of charge different

00:14:31,149 --> 00:14:38,589
ways to look at this but I think the

00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:40,899
most obvious answer how cheap it doesn't

00:14:38,589 --> 00:14:42,189
affect your business you just build some

00:14:40,899 --> 00:14:44,589
kind of cloud service and my

00:14:42,189 --> 00:14:47,170
understanding is that there are very

00:14:44,589 --> 00:14:51,790
many companies also here making business

00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:53,350
out of Drupal this way it's based on

00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:55,119
what the cheap your language here says

00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:59,529
that ok you must cause any work that

00:14:55,119 --> 00:15:01,809
blah blah blah distributor publish those

00:14:59,529 --> 00:15:04,839
are the key words these tubular publish

00:15:01,809 --> 00:15:07,509
you have to actually pleased to build

00:15:04,839 --> 00:15:09,429
yourself or to somebody else but as long

00:15:07,509 --> 00:15:11,709
as the software is in your own hands or

00:15:09,429 --> 00:15:14,499
only at the hands of your customer

00:15:11,709 --> 00:15:18,009
hosted somewhere is not distributed or

00:15:14,499 --> 00:15:22,449
published in the way gps says about this

00:15:18,009 --> 00:15:24,129
this thing and at that point you haven't

00:15:22,449 --> 00:15:26,019
disappeared it you are not under the

00:15:24,129 --> 00:15:28,720
cheap you alternate that you should give

00:15:26,019 --> 00:15:30,910
it free of charge to everybody so just

00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,660
host the code modified as much as you

00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:36,490
want

00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:40,510
and sail access to your service till

00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:43,740
access to your website whatever it is

00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:46,360
may make a make an online component that

00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:50,800
can be integrated with other sites if

00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:56,890
it's online HTTP you're very fine that's

00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:59,410
not distribution and of course it's a

00:15:56,890 --> 00:16:01,450
big trend in computing GPO doesn't

00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:04,150
affect this cloud service piece is more

00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:07,270
than anything anyway I think this is the

00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:09,670
biggest cloud business today I'm not

00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:11,590
sure about it but about my belief and

00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:13,900
the gut feeling is that this must be one

00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:18,310
of the biggest businesses these guys are

00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:21,160
working exactly under GPL this

00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:23,170
limitation here I think this Amazon Web

00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:24,820
Services is pretty much based on linux

00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:27,580
pretty much based on open source

00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:31,020
components you can buy from them today

00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:35,760
pretty much everything computing power

00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:38,920
operating system platform components

00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:42,880
over the cloud even individual software

00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:47,850
component access everything through

00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:50,890
access fees that's fine it's just on

00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:52,270
Amazon servers not locally hosted you

00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:55,180
don't get the software into your own

00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:59,110
servers you will never get it because of

00:16:55,180 --> 00:17:00,850
GPL they have been modifying the Linux

00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:02,590
and all the components so much they will

00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:05,260
never want to distribute those further

00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:09,490
they will keep them that's their

00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:11,740
competitive advantage and I think it's a

00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:13,630
very valid model and you know cloud is a

00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:15,340
big trend you see the pretty much

00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:19,030
everywhere you just have to figure out

00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:21,580
how can you make a service that can

00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:23,380
start comparing with the with for

00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:26,380
example of these guys to all what these

00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:30,280
guys can do today well that's that's a

00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:31,450
tall order that's a tall order and i

00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:36,120
understanding this Drupal community

00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:38,800
there's also like a lot of other kind of

00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:42,030
access and clouds cloud-based services

00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:42,030
writing and growing fast

00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:50,750
here's another part and I understand

00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:54,890
this is much more controversial than the

00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:57,440
first one component licensing and you

00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:59,720
look at the GPL it says you have to give

00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:04,100
your software free of charge to

00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:07,010
everybody if it in whole or in part

00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:13,970
contains or is derived from according to

00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:18,200
cheaper version 2 okay this is something

00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:19,760
you have to read very carefully but what

00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:21,289
has happened in many other context I

00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:24,100
understand maybe not in the Drupal

00:18:21,289 --> 00:18:26,870
context at least at this point is that

00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:28,640
there is an active component market for

00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:30,440
example on linux linux it cheaper

00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,419
version to license there's many

00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:37,549
commercial components and apps running

00:18:32,419 --> 00:18:41,360
on linux so in principle reading the

00:18:37,549 --> 00:18:44,570
cheap l don't think drupal yet you could

00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:46,880
develop plugins apps rewrite the whole

00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:51,320
platform or part of it make commercial

00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:53,480
extension and license those closed

00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:57,679
source proprietary charging money for

00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:59,539
that the third parties I think GPL

00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:04,220
allows that and many other contexts it

00:18:59,539 --> 00:19:05,600
has been determined it's very fine you

00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:07,460
can then do your licensing business

00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:10,370
there you can do the microsoft model

00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:12,380
here oracle model that scales it's a

00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:14,059
very good business model true try to

00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:17,299
test it actually in our company took

00:19:14,059 --> 00:19:19,070
Sarah we use pretty much this model we

00:19:17,299 --> 00:19:23,179
do components for linux we charge

00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:30,260
transfer those like we do for any kind

00:19:23,179 --> 00:19:32,120
of software another way to try to try to

00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:33,950
drink in your position if you're on the

00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:37,909
component business is to try to figure

00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:41,270
out if you can patent something for your

00:19:37,909 --> 00:19:43,159
component then you have even stronger

00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:46,820
arguments that you know this gpo can

00:19:43,159 --> 00:19:50,090
apply to my component i have a pattern

00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:52,010
for it so let's keep this GPL part and

00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:54,670
the component part which is under

00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:58,640
patterns are separate

00:19:54,670 --> 00:20:02,830
that's the idea and principal here okay

00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:02,830
if i go to the drupal org website and

00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:09,440
check the licensing section there i can

00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:11,450
see that this particular community has a

00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:14,600
little bit different approach to

00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:19,520
commercial extensions modules plugins

00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:21,260
themes however you call them if i write

00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,640
a model a theme do i have delighted

00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:24,140
under gpo there were some other

00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:26,270
questions in the in a similar fashion

00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:29,120
that can I kind of write a bridge that

00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:31,100
you know I can then have a commerce or

00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:33,800
component plugged into Drupal can I

00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:35,930
build this kind of commercial API

00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:40,640
interface and the answer is always the

00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:42,410
same it has to be under GPL forget about

00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:46,250
commercial licensing in this this

00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:48,740
context is what they say Drupal modules

00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:52,550
and themes or kind of plugins them

00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:57,410
whatever they was breached components

00:20:52,550 --> 00:21:00,320
are derivative work of Drupal the GPL on

00:20:57,410 --> 00:21:03,620
code applies to code that interacts with

00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:05,420
that code now they are talking about

00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:08,150
these modules and extension if the

00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:12,320
modular extension interacts with the

00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:16,760
main Drupal code that's enough you have

00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:19,370
to be under GPL wendys to putting your

00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:21,650
own modular theme therefore GPL applies

00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:23,780
to any pieces that directly interact

00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:31,100
with parts of Drupal that are under the

00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:32,720
GPL when I was checking this CMS systems

00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:35,660
content management systems i've found

00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:37,220
that for example WordPress has a little

00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:39,980
bit different approach there are

00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:42,500
websites where you can buy commercial

00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:44,810
WordPress components I actually remember

00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:48,410
when we build a website for this current

00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:50,240
company i'm having we did license some

00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:56,540
wordpress components for for that

00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:58,370
website but for drupal at least if you

00:21:56,540 --> 00:22:00,620
look at what is said in this lies in the

00:21:58,370 --> 00:22:03,860
faq this is this is very much against

00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:06,760
the community norms here do you know who

00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:06,760
has written this text

00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:13,500
does anybody know where does this come

00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:16,830
from it's a storm I don't think so this

00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:21,240
is from drupal org who was trying to use

00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:27,180
drupal org who is writing this text no

00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:30,360
idea because what I was left wondering

00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:32,250
is that this kind of text must serve the

00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:35,940
purpose of somebody and the goals of

00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:40,170
somebody now if you look at what the

00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:44,520
chip you said it said that in whole or

00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:47,400
in part contains or is derived from this

00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:49,890
illegal legal language it links you to

00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:52,250
the concept of derivative works which is

00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:55,170
a concept in corporate law and that

00:22:52,250 --> 00:23:00,270
concept has been then you know clarified

00:22:55,170 --> 00:23:03,510
in the number of legal cases and how the

00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:05,880
Drupal community faq interpret this text

00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:09,030
is that GPL applies to anything that

00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:15,000
interacts now interaction i think is

00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:17,460
much more broad that being a you know

00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:20,730
something that is derived from contains

00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:25,350
content basically means you copy code if

00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:27,210
you copy GPL code and you know copy

00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:29,070
paste it as part of your own program

00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:31,830
then you are derived then you must be

00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:35,730
under GPL but if you just interact

00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:39,240
without copying any code this caused a

00:23:35,730 --> 00:23:41,610
couple more steps further and i don't

00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:43,680
think this kind of interpretation at

00:23:41,610 --> 00:23:45,780
least is not based on copyright law it's

00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:47,840
based on something else I think it's

00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:49,830
based on a sample in the community

00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:52,380
having this approach like you said

00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:55,650
Richard Stallman is having reaches

00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:58,590
normal must build a free society he

00:23:55,650 --> 00:24:01,560
hates proprietary software he wants to

00:23:58,590 --> 00:24:03,180
read the law in a way that there's no

00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:04,650
proprietary software out there he

00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:08,450
doesn't care what the right

00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:10,320
interpretation of the law is he's like

00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:12,060
okay I don't want to say would reach the

00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:13,560
storm on is but let's say the ideology

00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:17,220
behind you know these kind of language

00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:19,820
is more like it's like more like

00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:19,820
pro-life

00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:32,230
while the way it should be red is like

00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:34,000
pro choice you can choose so I don't

00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:37,960
know who has written that but I think it

00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:41,830
goes goes further than copyright law now

00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:46,150
what does it mean in practice I think

00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:48,370
there's a being like a long time already

00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:50,200
but the couple last year's many for

00:24:48,370 --> 00:24:52,090
example mobile platforms have become

00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:53,860
really successful because they have been

00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:57,400
able to build ecosystem around the

00:24:53,860 --> 00:25:01,450
platform and by ecosystem a very key

00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:06,490
component has been enabling kind of

00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:08,380
commercial app development okay in other

00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:11,860
context you have this iTunes App Store

00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:13,630
Google Play a lot of games there and all

00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:16,570
kind of crappy ads but also like

00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:19,240
functionality utilities and even

00:25:16,570 --> 00:25:20,800
extensions to the platform it's very

00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:23,530
important you have this kind of app

00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:28,870
stores the community here okay run by a

00:25:23,530 --> 00:25:31,270
company different thing enables helps

00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:33,550
people to develop apps everybody can

00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:36,880
make money out of those while in this

00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:38,860
Drupal community I see kind of very

00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:45,040
negative approach to these kind of apps

00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:47,230
I don't understand why if these commonly

00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:48,760
things that you know is this cheap your

00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:50,530
lies no problem then I think the

00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:52,300
community suit themselves build some

00:25:50,530 --> 00:25:55,030
kind of commercial API so you can

00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:58,030
commercially extend RuPaul I think it

00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:59,559
would be good for the whole community or

00:25:58,030 --> 00:26:02,140
maybe I have understood something wrong

00:25:59,559 --> 00:26:04,150
here but is it is a concert I was having

00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:06,480
I didn't fully understand why this

00:26:04,150 --> 00:26:10,090
community is so so negative against the

00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:12,130
commercial extensions is there somebody

00:26:10,090 --> 00:26:17,830
here you can who can clarify this thing

00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:21,400
I won't send any if it's a

00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:22,780
closed commercial proprietary module so

00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:26,460
that's the power of the fruit

00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:28,960
right everybody can debug the shoes and

00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:30,640
yeah I fully understand that's the power

00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:32,410
that is to open but what if somebody

00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:34,780
wants to you know make the module

00:26:32,410 --> 00:26:36,970
commercial what does this community have

00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:40,090
against this guy I think still like

00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:42,310
makes the community kind of stronger an

00:26:40,090 --> 00:26:44,620
example is Linux community there's a lot

00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:47,080
of commercially extensions to the linux

00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:48,550
kernel and for example in disturb us

00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:51,700
have always said that he is like an open

00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:54,310
hiber he's totally like he has no moral

00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:57,580
moral points here and it's okay you can

00:26:54,310 --> 00:27:00,150
extend it in GPA or even even commercial

00:26:57,580 --> 00:27:03,400
way you just keep the arms length and

00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:05,200
follow the cheap bill but this community

00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:36,460
whoever wrote this guideline seems to

00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:38,740
see if they more in the lines of yeah

00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:40,060
fully Billy that the Communist must be

00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:41,620
then different between WordPress

00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:43,210
community and RuPaul and part of the

00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:46,540
reason i think it's rooted in this kind

00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:48,220
of language then answered a FAQ and it's

00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:49,810
a different community and i guess one of

00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:51,670
the answer to somebody who wants to

00:27:49,810 --> 00:27:54,880
develop a commercial extensive go to

00:27:51,670 --> 00:28:05,380
WordPress community maybe I never wrong

00:27:54,880 --> 00:28:07,210
conduct yeah so then using or

00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:08,860
interacting cannot infringe the

00:28:07,210 --> 00:28:10,690
copyright law and the other thing is

00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:12,970
that even if you don't follow the Jeep

00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:15,820
their rules you need somebody to sue it

00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:17,320
and have a budget for suing you and only

00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:18,760
then it becomes a problem so

00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:21,730
commercially you can do whatever you

00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:24,990
want as long as no there is not to

00:28:21,730 --> 00:28:27,399
somebody with a budget will sue you

00:28:24,990 --> 00:28:29,289
yeah I fully agree with you I was uh

00:28:27,399 --> 00:28:31,269
yeah I fully agree that you know this

00:28:29,289 --> 00:28:32,890
interaction that's not part of copyright

00:28:31,269 --> 00:28:35,559
and you know there should nobody should

00:28:32,890 --> 00:28:36,789
have a have a valid claim even if you if

00:28:35,559 --> 00:28:38,799
you extend it commerce and I'm just

00:28:36,789 --> 00:28:42,130
wondering why somebody wants you to

00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:46,330
think that it's a problem what's wrong

00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:48,880
with this community example if you do a

00:28:46,330 --> 00:28:51,850
drupal module for interacting with

00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:56,559
paypal to do payments is it suppose that

00:28:51,850 --> 00:28:58,630
paypal has to be GPL oh definitely not i

00:28:56,559 --> 00:29:00,730
think what is being thought about here

00:28:58,630 --> 00:29:02,409
is that you actually write locally

00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:13,510
locally hosted code this kind of

00:29:02,409 --> 00:29:15,279
component p a PHP code or something yeah

00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:17,590
okay if you think really broad I don't

00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:19,899
think the guy who wrote this can think

00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:23,230
like you know any any online accessible

00:29:19,899 --> 00:29:25,630
components or stuff over you interface

00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:27,760
with HTTP would be under this language I

00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:29,289
don't think they think that broadly but

00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:31,090
ok you can actually read it like that

00:29:29,289 --> 00:29:33,940
yes if you just read the text i think

00:29:31,090 --> 00:29:35,590
yourself hey this will need some

00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:43,240
clarification that's at least my

00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:45,580
conclusion here okay yeah so what's

00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:46,809
wrong with this approach I don't see

00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:48,279
anything wrong here that I think this

00:29:46,809 --> 00:29:50,710
would strangle the community if there

00:29:48,279 --> 00:29:53,049
would be an app store on top of the

00:29:50,710 --> 00:30:03,700
platform maybe somebody can take an

00:29:53,049 --> 00:30:05,169
initiative I fully agree with you so why

00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:08,669
there is no app store why there is this

00:30:05,169 --> 00:30:08,669
language down there on the website

00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:20,299
oh it's a mistake oh ok ok maybe I I

00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:22,100
don't think it's a mistake I think it's

00:30:20,299 --> 00:30:24,590
a very very carefully thought of thought

00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:26,450
you know thing is exactly according what

00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:30,620
this reads a storm stole my thing stand

00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:32,929
there yeah all right that was just my

00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:36,169
observation and I was left wondering

00:30:32,929 --> 00:30:37,549
what this whole thing is about obvious

00:30:36,169 --> 00:30:39,380
the guilty ones are not in this room

00:30:37,549 --> 00:30:44,840
they would have been definitely a good

00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:49,909
defense for the language ok so what

00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:51,590
business models are left here always you

00:30:49,909 --> 00:30:54,770
can do prosy understand this is the main

00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:56,179
business model in this community and GPL

00:30:54,770 --> 00:31:00,200
has nothing to do when you're selling

00:30:56,179 --> 00:31:02,120
hours and the projects you develop the

00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:05,090
website for a customer you do custom

00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:06,740
work that's very fine and if you

00:31:05,090 --> 00:31:09,110
distribute the code to your customer

00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:11,179
then if you do then change the second

00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:13,490
algeria you have to release the code if

00:31:11,179 --> 00:31:17,690
somebody comes after you and ask about

00:31:13,490 --> 00:31:22,340
to ask about the code the challenge with

00:31:17,690 --> 00:31:24,200
this model is that does it scale the

00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:26,030
companies i see in this community is a

00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:28,669
very large community may be one of the

00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:31,039
most active and biggest open source

00:31:28,669 --> 00:31:32,620
communities today is that the many many

00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:35,600
of the companies in this community

00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:38,620
Commerce out whatever project you have

00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:41,090
here are quite small scale still today

00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:43,820
probably because the business model is

00:31:41,090 --> 00:31:47,210
not scalable if you sell projects it

00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:49,700
doesn't scale well here's how it scales

00:31:47,210 --> 00:31:52,450
you need to have a lot of people to work

00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:56,059
on these projects and there are already

00:31:52,450 --> 00:32:00,320
companies like like I don't know IBM it

00:31:56,059 --> 00:32:03,080
was capgemini here accenture other

00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:08,950
consultants companies they have this you

00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:13,820
know cubicles you go to India it's like

00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:15,490
this picture hundred times China same

00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:19,570
thing there's a lot of people out there

00:32:15,490 --> 00:32:23,120
they can do very cheap consultancy work

00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:25,159
if this grows bigger I think the guys

00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:25,520
who have the cubicles ready have the

00:32:25,159 --> 00:32:30,140
admin

00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:33,860
it's so that's the challenge with this

00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:36,230
this model not GPL but how does it scale

00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:40,190
but ok you can you can run your small

00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:42,740
shop scale it to 5 10 20 50 people no

00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:44,630
problem have your local market but then

00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:47,180
the scared really big test that's the

00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:49,340
challenge I think it's really hard to

00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:54,980
build a new Microsoft here or even you

00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:57,350
mysql here that's really hard yeah I

00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:58,970
understand Rupa founders company could

00:32:57,350 --> 00:33:02,450
be one of the biggest but still that one

00:32:58,970 --> 00:33:11,270
is not like at least at this point not

00:33:02,450 --> 00:33:17,320
another microsoft okay that was a part

00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:23,750
of GPL then couple more points about

00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:26,090
patterns may be already touched upon

00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:28,580
this topic so okay there's a lot of

00:33:26,090 --> 00:33:31,430
patterns and the more you read about

00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:35,540
them the more you can you know become

00:33:31,430 --> 00:33:37,610
concerned about patterns you can find a

00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:39,980
pattern that looks like applies to your

00:33:37,610 --> 00:33:42,500
project looks like applies to exactly

00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:45,800
what you are doing you can hear about

00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:47,540
these patent lawsuits threatening story

00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:49,760
sad stories about what happened when you

00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:53,030
got a patent lawsuit or even a patent

00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:56,090
red but at the end of the day do you

00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:58,070
personally know somebody else for

00:33:56,090 --> 00:34:00,710
example in this community who have

00:33:58,070 --> 00:34:03,050
received even a threat of patent

00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:04,610
infringement is there somebody in this

00:34:03,050 --> 00:34:14,350
room that has heard about this kind of

00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:18,679
parent read anybody you have heard okay

00:34:14,350 --> 00:34:20,570
there you go there you go okay but was

00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:24,560
it in this context it was in noise or

00:34:20,570 --> 00:34:25,909
not in Drupal community okay right at

00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:28,010
the important thing about these patterns

00:34:25,909 --> 00:34:32,030
is that as long as you end up you know

00:34:28,010 --> 00:34:35,060
community of companies with 50 people or

00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:38,360
less this is not the community and

00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:41,600
conduct square you litigate patterns or

00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:47,540
even threat with with patent claims

00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:49,669
anybody there's a lot of talk but it's

00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:53,080
talk is cheap you can always hear about

00:34:49,669 --> 00:34:57,080
these patterns and there's a lot of

00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:58,310
online forums and trades where people

00:34:57,080 --> 00:35:00,380
are talking about patterns of thinking

00:34:58,310 --> 00:35:01,790
how bad they are how harmful therefore

00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:04,870
suicided you can develop software

00:35:01,790 --> 00:35:06,770
anymore but at the end of the day I

00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:08,510
don't think there's anybody in this

00:35:06,770 --> 00:35:12,710
company whose would be concerned about

00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:14,310
patterns two months just to must talk

00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:17,100
about them yes

00:35:14,310 --> 00:35:19,610
because the sales people should because

00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:22,800
it's big customers who will be

00:35:19,610 --> 00:35:25,290
threatened by patent lawsuits and they

00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:28,230
are prepared for it of course but if you

00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:30,390
can somehow make them believe that your

00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:32,670
code doesn't a bridge and it happens

00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:35,820
they will pay more to you because they

00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:37,470
save on their risk position they you can

00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:40,380
never indemnify them you will be

00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:45,450
bankrupt before the first loss sitting

00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:47,880
in the court but they kind of calculate

00:35:45,450 --> 00:35:49,980
the patent risk on to everything day

00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:52,050
they do and if you can convince them

00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:57,420
that this is lower risk and something

00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:59,610
else then they they basically are able

00:35:57,420 --> 00:36:01,170
to pay you more and I think anything

00:35:59,610 --> 00:36:02,480
open-source is very good for that

00:36:01,170 --> 00:36:05,550
because generally open source solutions

00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:10,610
are not litigated against because it

00:36:05,550 --> 00:36:10,610
creates so much bad will corporations

00:36:10,790 --> 00:36:15,000
yeah thnkx that's a very good you know

00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:16,860
follow-up comment on this I was thinking

00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,450
this from the perspective if you want to

00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:20,430
you know start your shop and develop

00:36:18,450 --> 00:36:22,410
your own software to do big concert

00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:23,700
about patterns and my answer is no but

00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:26,210
yes if you're going to sell your

00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:28,440
software to some very large company that

00:36:26,210 --> 00:36:30,720
works internationally in many markets

00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:33,300
especially in the United States those

00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:37,500
companies always look at their you know

00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:39,590
risk position including potential to you

00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:42,720
know in Finn's anybody's patterns and

00:36:39,590 --> 00:36:44,340
whenever they buy something that costs a

00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:46,800
lot of money or even that is relevant

00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:49,080
for their business it doesn't go so much

00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:51,300
they always ask so is there potential we

00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:53,460
infringe somebody's parents and they

00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:54,810
want from their supplier designer some

00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:57,720
kind of agreement where they email

00:36:54,810 --> 00:36:59,550
indemnify this big company basically you

00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:02,340
you seldom an insurance as part of the

00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:05,040
delivery usually free of charge you can

00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:06,450
charge more you have to insure them the

00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:08,460
best of our knowledge there's no

00:37:06,450 --> 00:37:13,950
patterns and if there are I pay the cost

00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:16,350
for litigation the things that you

00:37:13,950 --> 00:37:17,210
probably have seen the patent databases

00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:20,210
and

00:37:17,210 --> 00:37:23,990
those claims that are just huge and very

00:37:20,210 --> 00:37:27,520
difficult for a human to just you know

00:37:23,990 --> 00:37:30,530
read them all and things that the amount

00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:32,660
the thousands or maybe even tens of

00:37:30,530 --> 00:37:36,790
thousands of patent attorneys that you

00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:40,400
would need to litigate against like a

00:37:36,790 --> 00:37:42,740
50-person company is just huge in the

00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:45,170
present but that doesn't mean that like

00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:47,080
in 50 years from now in 100 years from

00:37:45,170 --> 00:37:50,150
now that we won't have that

00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:53,000
technological ability and which we do so

00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:57,080
then we're effectively killing

00:37:53,000 --> 00:38:00,380
innovation because like you can only do

00:37:57,080 --> 00:38:03,370
stuff that is like 20 years behind which

00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:06,830
is the average life movement of a patent

00:38:03,370 --> 00:38:11,150
that's my first thing and the other one

00:38:06,830 --> 00:38:14,330
is much brother which is like patents

00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:19,300
are supposed to be for tangible goods

00:38:14,330 --> 00:38:22,250
that can have to be like made

00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:26,870
industrially and I just don't see how

00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:29,120
software patents you can fit that and it

00:38:26,870 --> 00:38:31,940
seems odd that there are software

00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:34,610
patents at all for me so mm-hmm that's

00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:37,670
why I was so curious about to hear your

00:38:34,610 --> 00:38:39,950
take on that well my tech is very

00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:41,510
practical first of all like the latter

00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:43,010
part of your question it's very good

00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:45,050
point and it's the file Asafa called

00:38:43,010 --> 00:38:47,570
point that can first of all software be

00:38:45,050 --> 00:38:51,200
patented it's a very very valid question

00:38:47,570 --> 00:38:53,240
and I think many people would answer

00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:55,430
negative no you shouldn't be able to

00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:57,470
plan and suffer however my perspective

00:38:55,430 --> 00:38:59,270
is practical and I can see software is

00:38:57,470 --> 00:39:01,190
patent that is not going away there will

00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:03,080
be more software patents so from

00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:05,330
practical perspective that question is

00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:07,400
not relevant actually it's the finest of

00:39:05,330 --> 00:39:10,460
a question you can you can ask / beer

00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:13,250
okay the first part of your point was

00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:14,540
you know the distant future that i'll be

00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:16,520
building this kind of wrong kind of

00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:18,140
societies was also i understand a bit so

00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:20,840
that a question or 50 years from now

00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:26,300
you're in a different position but hey

00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:28,430
we are living today and right so i also

00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:32,320
have this kind of the IRS did a very

00:39:28,430 --> 00:39:32,320
short-sighted maybe here maybe i'm wrong

00:39:58,130 --> 00:40:09,450
where we are today I really don't

00:40:05,210 --> 00:40:11,580
understand how for example your company

00:40:09,450 --> 00:40:16,500
uses Drupal right we don't use true

00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:20,340
pastoria body yes yeah we have going to

00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:24,690
build a lot okay I mean just like it was

00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:36,620
almost like a how do we exploit open

00:40:24,690 --> 00:40:36,620
source to how do we use to protect our

00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:50,730
entirely contrary to the spirit spirits

00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:53,940
I understand where you come from and

00:40:50,730 --> 00:40:57,329
there I'd like to come back to this how

00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:59,099
i phrase this worse today the community

00:40:57,329 --> 00:41:23,119
like like how you describe it is like a

00:40:59,099 --> 00:41:26,130
pro life what did 20 years ago stripping

00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:27,720
to create open source was it good mood

00:41:26,130 --> 00:41:29,099
for businesses of course because like

00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:32,010
you are saying it made it patent

00:41:29,099 --> 00:41:33,480
palatable to them but I don't think

00:41:32,010 --> 00:41:35,670
there's anything essentially wrong with

00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:39,440
having a certain level of moles ethics

00:41:35,670 --> 00:41:39,440
and what we do that is

00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:46,430
kind of commercial

00:41:50,930 --> 00:41:58,589
but i think that the you are now putting

00:41:55,200 --> 00:42:00,930
your own morals and ethics that d that

00:41:58,589 --> 00:42:03,479
we all should follow those instead of

00:42:00,930 --> 00:42:06,809
that if i want to export open source i

00:42:03,479 --> 00:42:08,849
should be free to do so utilizes a large

00:42:06,809 --> 00:42:10,890
it if the if it wasn't strong if this

00:42:08,849 --> 00:42:14,039
was light it wrong then you go world and

00:42:10,890 --> 00:42:16,829
change things but i am the thief

00:42:14,039 --> 00:42:20,279
community expels me that's the price if

00:42:16,829 --> 00:42:23,309
i had to pay but we should not we should

00:42:20,279 --> 00:42:25,140
not stop talking about these things

00:42:23,309 --> 00:42:27,739
because if somebody thinks that they

00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:31,140
aren't ethical because they are still

00:42:27,739 --> 00:42:32,940
valid things in the sense of the low

00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:35,459
current laws and that's the point oh

00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:38,849
definitely eternal and that's why it's

00:42:35,459 --> 00:42:40,859
good to good to hear I invited Nico here

00:42:38,849 --> 00:42:43,109
that they will we hear something else

00:42:40,859 --> 00:42:44,940
than the echo chamber we hear something

00:42:43,109 --> 00:42:46,650
that we don't like well I don't have to

00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:47,670
do community either said oh no yeah but

00:42:46,650 --> 00:42:51,660
I gotta change yeah but then it ought to

00:42:47,670 --> 00:42:53,910
be that the ice it's more that we there

00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:55,859
are different ways to build the

00:42:53,910 --> 00:42:57,869
community like wordpress likely like the

00:42:55,859 --> 00:43:00,660
Apple has the communities some make

00:42:57,869 --> 00:43:06,539
money some don't make money whether it's

00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:10,440
a sort of pro money or pro but it would

00:43:06,539 --> 00:43:13,769
be pro cold in a sense or something else

00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:17,880
those are choices that we have made it

00:43:13,769 --> 00:43:19,410
the community but at least for me it's

00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:21,059
refreshing to hear that there are

00:43:19,410 --> 00:43:23,309
different options and different ways to

00:43:21,059 --> 00:43:24,869
move forward and if somebody thinks that

00:43:23,309 --> 00:43:27,180
you see they are exploit somebody else

00:43:24,869 --> 00:43:28,849
might be services just really look at

00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:32,359
the business

00:43:28,849 --> 00:43:34,099
I successfully let me go to continue to

00:43:32,359 --> 00:43:36,499
the end alright that's a wrap wrap up

00:43:34,099 --> 00:43:38,900
but I understand this kind of talk I'm

00:43:36,499 --> 00:43:40,999
controversial yes I understand i mean in

00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:42,380
a hostile territory at least some of you

00:43:40,999 --> 00:43:45,470
might think like him and I fully

00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:47,299
appreciate your points I'd like to be a

00:43:45,470 --> 00:43:48,890
better person myself and politics and

00:43:47,299 --> 00:43:51,289
I'm not the cheese's unfortunately so

00:43:48,890 --> 00:43:54,410
I'm just a I'm teased as a mercy I'm a

00:43:51,289 --> 00:43:56,089
business guy I think I'm up close part

00:43:54,410 --> 00:43:57,950
of the Microsoft awesome I my thinking

00:43:56,089 --> 00:43:59,630
has been influenced by Microsoft patent

00:43:57,950 --> 00:44:01,579
attorneys a lot in recent years so

00:43:59,630 --> 00:44:06,529
that's where I come from that's what I

00:44:01,579 --> 00:44:08,119
what I'm i am ok yeah anyway about these

00:44:06,529 --> 00:44:10,609
patterns and their litigation so what's

00:44:08,119 --> 00:44:12,920
what's happening today and my main

00:44:10,609 --> 00:44:16,999
argument was here that if you're doing a

00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:20,329
small shop based on a you know Drupal

00:44:16,999 --> 00:44:22,249
open source CMS most of the pattern

00:44:20,329 --> 00:44:24,200
stuff doesn't affect you there are the

00:44:22,249 --> 00:44:25,970
big guys like Microsoft and others in

00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:30,319
consumer electronics pace they are

00:44:25,970 --> 00:44:31,999
litigating a lot of parents and those if

00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:34,009
you call them patent warheads they are

00:44:31,999 --> 00:44:36,670
not actually targeted that innovation

00:44:34,009 --> 00:44:41,269
they are targeted money at deep pockets

00:44:36,670 --> 00:44:42,829
that's what we are seeing there and

00:44:41,269 --> 00:44:46,880
another point here is that what these

00:44:42,829 --> 00:44:48,619
patterns actually cover okay like my

00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:51,170
approach is to the patterns are there

00:44:48,619 --> 00:44:53,809
they exist they are not going away no no

00:44:51,170 --> 00:44:55,940
matter what we do you know okay one part

00:44:53,809 --> 00:44:57,469
of my history was that I founded an

00:44:55,940 --> 00:45:00,319
organization called Electronic Frontier

00:44:57,469 --> 00:45:03,859
Finland a part of this kind of a similar

00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:06,519
than eff in in Finland that was like 12

00:45:03,859 --> 00:45:09,170
years ago I went to the Parliament I act

00:45:06,519 --> 00:45:10,700
advocated against patterns I i went to

00:45:09,170 --> 00:45:12,729
the european parliament i was there we

00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:14,809
treat the storm and the same panel

00:45:12,729 --> 00:45:17,420
advocating against patterns ten years

00:45:14,809 --> 00:45:20,299
ago i found out this doesn't work we

00:45:17,420 --> 00:45:22,279
never win this war i gave up i went to

00:45:20,299 --> 00:45:23,450
do this business and what I'm thinking

00:45:22,279 --> 00:45:25,009
like you're looking at these patterns

00:45:23,450 --> 00:45:27,130
and talking with this patent attorneys

00:45:25,009 --> 00:45:31,579
from the speaker companies is that

00:45:27,130 --> 00:45:35,989
actually the kind of area of valid

00:45:31,579 --> 00:45:38,660
strong patterns very narrow and they are

00:45:35,989 --> 00:45:40,400
almost always well-known the same

00:45:38,660 --> 00:45:41,960
patterns all indicators time and again

00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:42,230
like this fat file system patterns which

00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:44,210
is

00:45:42,230 --> 00:45:46,700
kind of strong pattern but you can

00:45:44,210 --> 00:45:48,260
almost like lease those areas and almost

00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:50,570
least the patterns that are valid and

00:45:48,260 --> 00:45:53,210
good you can you can think there's many

00:45:50,570 --> 00:45:55,010
parents mediacodec mp3 good example

00:45:53,210 --> 00:45:58,520
everybody knows about the mp3 patent and

00:45:55,010 --> 00:46:02,119
many other codecs are patented okay brm

00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:04,820
this you know digital restrictions

00:46:02,119 --> 00:46:08,090
management to use the free software

00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:10,730
guide terminology file system storage

00:46:08,090 --> 00:46:12,800
technologies compress and security

00:46:10,730 --> 00:46:14,210
algorithms those areas have strong

00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:16,490
patterns and you should be concerned

00:46:14,210 --> 00:46:18,200
about them but then again there are many

00:46:16,490 --> 00:46:22,040
areas where the patterns are really weak

00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:24,380
and I think this content management

00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:27,609
system in general user interface that

00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:29,300
this stuff is an area of weak patterns

00:46:27,609 --> 00:46:31,910
there are also something called

00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:34,460
registered design design patterns in the

00:46:31,910 --> 00:46:37,550
United States registered design rights

00:46:34,460 --> 00:46:40,910
in Europe you can you can you know try

00:46:37,550 --> 00:46:42,800
to get an equity right for your user

00:46:40,910 --> 00:46:45,020
interface and functionally there but

00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:47,030
these are not strong patterns it means

00:46:45,020 --> 00:46:49,850
that you can circulate them pretty

00:46:47,030 --> 00:46:52,960
easily good example is this one just one

00:46:49,850 --> 00:46:56,359
example that's it's a patent I think

00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:58,460
both both in in United States the

00:46:56,359 --> 00:47:00,980
registered design in Europe filed and

00:46:58,460 --> 00:47:04,220
the not sure if it's still valid but

00:47:00,980 --> 00:47:07,880
most likely it is but can you circumvent

00:47:04,220 --> 00:47:10,430
that I think many people here can figure

00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:13,550
out quite quickly some other way to you

00:47:10,430 --> 00:47:16,130
know do the same functionality what is

00:47:13,550 --> 00:47:18,760
registered here is exactly this kind of

00:47:16,130 --> 00:47:20,930
mechanism and these kind of graphics and

00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:22,490
this kind of stuff and there are many

00:47:20,930 --> 00:47:24,940
many similar stuff you know Apple

00:47:22,490 --> 00:47:30,260
basically these days they register every

00:47:24,940 --> 00:47:32,030
kind of screenshot from iphone the you

00:47:30,260 --> 00:47:34,010
know opening screen all the all the

00:47:32,030 --> 00:47:38,690
icons they're registered designs you can

00:47:34,010 --> 00:47:40,190
exactly copy them but if you think you

00:47:38,690 --> 00:47:41,930
can you can circulate this you can have

00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:43,970
another Megan you know the how android

00:47:41,930 --> 00:47:46,100
phone opens there's all kind of stuff

00:47:43,970 --> 00:47:47,720
you can do there to make it open not

00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:51,080
just this kind of slide to unlock and

00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:55,210
that's totally fine this is a weak

00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:55,210
parent a week design right

00:47:56,560 --> 00:48:03,050
okay final point about patterns again I

00:48:00,980 --> 00:48:05,600
understand this might be controversy at

00:48:03,050 --> 00:48:07,670
the some of you what if you think of in

00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:11,390
a different way about these patterns and

00:48:07,670 --> 00:48:13,220
and design rights this means you step

00:48:11,390 --> 00:48:16,040
you know to the different side of the

00:48:13,220 --> 00:48:21,470
table you think about could we acquire

00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:25,160
own you know strong registered right

00:48:21,470 --> 00:48:27,290
here compared to this litigation which

00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:29,150
is really expensive and only the big

00:48:27,290 --> 00:48:33,260
companies are doing that actually

00:48:29,150 --> 00:48:34,880
smaller shops can file patterns and you

00:48:33,260 --> 00:48:37,940
can register your designs with

00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:42,020
relatively modest cost like ten twenty

00:48:37,940 --> 00:48:43,940
thousand you can have a patent if you

00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:47,030
have very good strong patterns and

00:48:43,940 --> 00:48:48,650
designs I think your company can be more

00:48:47,030 --> 00:48:50,330
valuable if you're looking for getting

00:48:48,650 --> 00:48:53,540
investment if you're looking to sell

00:48:50,330 --> 00:48:55,520
your your company if you have a company

00:48:53,540 --> 00:48:57,590
with patterns or register design is

00:48:55,520 --> 00:49:02,390
always more valuable than a company

00:48:57,590 --> 00:49:04,850
without any any strong IP and okay

00:49:02,390 --> 00:49:07,220
having that kind of rights I want to

00:49:04,850 --> 00:49:08,780
repeat this thing it doesn't mean you're

00:49:07,220 --> 00:49:10,960
going against the community you can

00:49:08,780 --> 00:49:15,050
decide what you do with your registered

00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:16,700
designs or your patterns you can license

00:49:15,050 --> 00:49:18,110
them free of charge for the community

00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:21,320
you can try to get money from other

00:49:18,110 --> 00:49:23,030
other other companies you can try try

00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:25,480
that approach when you are trying to you

00:49:23,030 --> 00:49:28,340
know develop commerce all extensions

00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:30,530
don't mix UTP a person tree that's

00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:33,260
problematic with talents though use

00:49:30,530 --> 00:49:36,560
cheaper version too but that's one

00:49:33,260 --> 00:49:38,380
approach then you know if you limit your

00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:41,210
mind to this kind of free software

00:49:38,380 --> 00:49:44,390
thinking you don't even consider this

00:49:41,210 --> 00:49:48,200
option but if you free your mind if you

00:49:44,390 --> 00:49:50,360
think pro-choice here's when I

00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:52,730
approached you could take okay there are

00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:57,080
many many companies like that i just

00:49:52,730 --> 00:50:00,950
found this website that are least patent

00:49:57,080 --> 00:50:02,570
valuations i'm not sure myself how

00:50:00,950 --> 00:50:06,260
successful or how important these

00:50:02,570 --> 00:50:07,220
companies but the data data looks good

00:50:06,260 --> 00:50:11,720
okay somebody's

00:50:07,220 --> 00:50:15,800
chatting chatting to me same time these

00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:17,450
guys least some of the recent mergers

00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:21,580
and acquisitions wear patterns were

00:50:17,450 --> 00:50:21,580
important in the merger and acquisition

00:50:21,670 --> 00:50:27,050
actually this is a pure pure patent

00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:29,530
patent purchases here and there that's

00:50:27,050 --> 00:50:33,349
just counting the value of a pattern and

00:50:29,530 --> 00:50:37,160
they all technology transactions in

00:50:33,349 --> 00:50:40,280
general about the software or hardware

00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:42,590
flash memory imprinting data transaction

00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:45,530
ecommerce document management average

00:50:42,590 --> 00:50:48,890
life average value of a patent is more

00:50:45,530 --> 00:50:50,960
than 200,000 it's not bad you have five

00:50:48,890 --> 00:50:56,050
patterns your company value just wind up

00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:56,050
1 million if those are okay patterns I

00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:04,930
don't think patterns are evil they exist

00:51:08,020 --> 00:51:13,580
yeah this is a final slide this was a

00:51:11,210 --> 00:51:15,520
real a you know reference to the earlier

00:51:13,580 --> 00:51:19,119
slide where you started the you know

00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:20,900
finding gold and then you get the mine I

00:51:19,119 --> 00:51:23,480
don't know if you get it through

00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:26,119
patterns or what way you get it but er

00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:29,300
yeah this is of course the goal you want

00:51:26,119 --> 00:51:30,680
to reach okay thank you if you has any

00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:38,780
any more questions you are you're free

00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:41,859
to go ahead I mean no one discusses the

00:51:38,780 --> 00:51:45,080
importance of patents in driving

00:51:41,859 --> 00:51:49,099
technological breakthroughs and sporting

00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:51,440
the innovation of many patents but you

00:51:49,099 --> 00:51:55,700
were just talking about strong patents

00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:58,099
and weak patterns right and i think that

00:51:55,700 --> 00:52:02,390
here no one is against strong patents

00:51:58,099 --> 00:52:03,710
stuff like new algorithms things that

00:52:02,390 --> 00:52:07,440
you know

00:52:03,710 --> 00:52:10,349
our importance and our real

00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:13,020
breakthroughs but now something that you

00:52:10,349 --> 00:52:15,930
described as a week patent in my views

00:52:13,020 --> 00:52:18,599
they shouldn't be accepted at all by the

00:52:15,930 --> 00:52:22,680
Institute's because they just drive

00:52:18,599 --> 00:52:25,670
confusion they expose many many people

00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:28,200
who are doing honest work to like

00:52:25,670 --> 00:52:31,410
possible patent infringement and

00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:35,220
possible even bankruptcy you might say

00:52:31,410 --> 00:52:39,329
that it doesn't happen very often that

00:52:35,220 --> 00:52:45,030
the some big companies use a small guy

00:52:39,329 --> 00:52:48,060
but that's mostly because of PR so it's

00:52:45,030 --> 00:52:50,910
not really a valid reason in my book so

00:52:48,060 --> 00:52:55,050
what's your thought on the amount of

00:52:50,910 --> 00:52:58,410
weak patents that are emerging just so

00:52:55,050 --> 00:53:02,030
big companies can try to get to other

00:52:58,410 --> 00:53:06,660
companies big pockets as you have put it

00:53:02,030 --> 00:53:08,550
yeah I fully fully you know support your

00:53:06,660 --> 00:53:12,690
idea that week patterns would be somehow

00:53:08,550 --> 00:53:14,460
you know driven out of out of existence

00:53:12,690 --> 00:53:16,200
but I don't know how to do that the

00:53:14,460 --> 00:53:19,079
patent system seems to be very liberal

00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:21,329
and you know patent offices LOL out of

00:53:19,079 --> 00:53:22,770
weak and bad patterns that's that's

00:53:21,329 --> 00:53:26,640
definitely a problem and I think

00:53:22,770 --> 00:53:28,589
everybody agrees and use it yourself be

00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:31,140
careful if you if you invest in pattern

00:53:28,589 --> 00:53:34,260
don't don't fire those bad Patterson an

00:53:31,140 --> 00:53:39,170
improvement you that system is it like

00:53:34,260 --> 00:53:42,750
the technical competence of people

00:53:39,170 --> 00:53:45,690
working at those patent offices or argit

00:53:42,750 --> 00:53:47,579
are they just dirty and one more fees or

00:53:45,690 --> 00:53:50,069
whatever well that's a really difficult

00:53:47,579 --> 00:53:51,599
difficult question and I don't have an

00:53:50,069 --> 00:53:54,060
answer to that one there's a lot of talk

00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:56,369
about that in there as many proposals

00:53:54,060 --> 00:53:58,050
have been made and I don't know how to

00:53:56,369 --> 00:54:00,810
how the fix the system really that's

00:53:58,050 --> 00:54:03,900
it's difficult to fix butter that's a

00:54:00,810 --> 00:54:08,520
difficult area yeah as a husband or

00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:09,479
patent attorney on semi expert on this

00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:11,890
one's on the

00:54:09,479 --> 00:54:16,779
the part of the part of the issue is

00:54:11,890 --> 00:54:19,509
that the u.s. u.s. PTO is really lacks

00:54:16,779 --> 00:54:22,359
on certain things does not have

00:54:19,509 --> 00:54:24,640
competent people is getting better but

00:54:22,359 --> 00:54:29,289
allows a lot of lot of load of crap

00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:31,119
through it and the US model of

00:54:29,289 --> 00:54:35,640
litigation that they're going to the

00:54:31,119 --> 00:54:40,779
court is also bit toxic in that sense

00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:42,309
the ways how you can describe a simple

00:54:40,779 --> 00:54:43,569
solution for simple problem that

00:54:42,309 --> 00:54:46,809
everybody can figure out that they

00:54:43,569 --> 00:54:48,339
listed how girls can be much created to

00:54:46,809 --> 00:54:50,680
a complex language that you don't

00:54:48,339 --> 00:54:53,710
actually understand it and then you win

00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:57,700
when you go to the lawsuits then they

00:54:53,710 --> 00:55:00,190
are then there comes problem and then

00:54:57,700 --> 00:55:01,809
the final thing that I see part of the

00:55:00,190 --> 00:55:05,229
problem that when you when you start to

00:55:01,809 --> 00:55:06,549
you make patterns with engineers that

00:55:05,229 --> 00:55:08,259
you have engineers talking about this

00:55:06,549 --> 00:55:12,549
thing today the other the X emanator is

00:55:08,259 --> 00:55:14,200
engineer the you are engineer the patent

00:55:12,549 --> 00:55:15,759
attorney in certain countries engineer

00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:19,329
some other countries is a technical aw

00:55:15,759 --> 00:55:21,039
yer but when you start to litigate can

00:55:19,329 --> 00:55:23,319
you drop all of these to the background

00:55:21,039 --> 00:55:25,119
and the lawyers talk and they don't they

00:55:23,319 --> 00:55:28,089
and the code they won't even understand

00:55:25,119 --> 00:55:30,460
what happened is at the end how simple

00:55:28,089 --> 00:55:34,479
how complex thing is in Saudi system is

00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:37,870
broken but nobody has the power to fix

00:55:34,479 --> 00:55:53,200
it so we just have to leave it

00:55:37,870 --> 00:55:55,870
sir you had a comment I would not

00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:57,550
recommend him to patent anything he's

00:55:55,870 --> 00:56:08,560
doing infrastructure stuff that should

00:55:57,550 --> 00:56:10,870
be free of all IP don't think like that

00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:23,230
are you okay with you know commerce a

00:56:10,870 --> 00:56:25,420
linux applications all right i fully

00:56:23,230 --> 00:56:27,940
agree with that one i agree i actually I

00:56:25,420 --> 00:56:29,710
want all infrastructure stuff to really

00:56:27,940 --> 00:56:31,420
deep level stuff to be free that's

00:56:29,710 --> 00:56:35,160
definitely what it should be web web

00:56:31,420 --> 00:56:35,160
must be free there's no doubt on that

00:56:44,550 --> 00:56:52,420
now okay okay how I would see it as you

00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:55,840
know the state must provide us the roads

00:56:52,420 --> 00:57:04,420
but cars must be you know private that's

00:56:55,840 --> 00:57:05,890
how I see but if we pay tax it doesn't

00:57:04,420 --> 00:57:07,720
mean that I have a free access to any

00:57:05,890 --> 00:57:14,830
car i want you know i can't have the

00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:18,010
keys to the car sorry about it but thats

00:57:14,830 --> 00:57:20,200
also beast condition that is I think

00:57:18,010 --> 00:57:24,840
that the there's a good case in the

00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:29,740
Bluetooth back in the 95 when it was in

00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:31,810
invited invented by Arizona in Sweden

00:57:29,740 --> 00:57:34,540
they may business calculation that they

00:57:31,810 --> 00:57:36,550
will earn more if they will give a

00:57:34,540 --> 00:57:38,590
license to everybody for free but they

00:57:36,550 --> 00:57:40,890
get mad at it and then they just say

00:57:38,590 --> 00:57:43,420
that okay we have happened in it and

00:57:40,890 --> 00:57:45,220
we've haven't probably apparently black

00:57:43,420 --> 00:57:47,050
Volvo little for safety belt that is

00:57:45,220 --> 00:57:49,060
patently but it's useful for everybody

00:57:47,050 --> 00:57:51,710
making sweets are so generous

00:57:49,060 --> 00:57:52,910
nice nice country that everything's fine

00:57:51,710 --> 00:57:54,950
and so forth they have a lot of money

00:57:52,910 --> 00:57:57,200
those that have to care but people like

00:57:54,950 --> 00:58:02,450
us coming from FEMA we have to tear so

00:57:57,200 --> 00:58:04,550
there anyhow the you could do with the

00:58:02,450 --> 00:58:06,710
patent also so that you say that okay

00:58:04,550 --> 00:58:09,620
nobody can own this anymore because we

00:58:06,710 --> 00:58:10,820
own it we give it to provide Bonnie so

00:58:09,620 --> 00:58:15,020
you can think of it in different ways

00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:17,720
but Eric's on make no mistake that

00:58:15,020 --> 00:58:21,080
Erickson was not the Bennett venerable

00:58:17,720 --> 00:58:22,520
and innovator that okay i use this stuff

00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:25,130
up they made a calculation that we will

00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:27,440
earn more if everybody else uses is too

00:58:25,130 --> 00:58:29,510
and they make sure also that if they

00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:31,610
will most probably be I don't know the

00:58:29,510 --> 00:58:35,180
experience but I guess that they most

00:58:31,610 --> 00:58:36,650
probably closed the clauses in the in

00:58:35,180 --> 00:58:39,770
the lies that you licensed include

00:58:36,650 --> 00:58:42,440
through is that you won't you won't

00:58:39,770 --> 00:58:44,800
litigate against ericsson that they

00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:48,830
cover the backs also in the same process

00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:50,810
because i would do that off anyhow that

00:58:48,830 --> 00:58:52,640
was for my wife that there are always

00:58:50,810 --> 00:58:56,210
always make sure that they can give you

00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:59,030
happen to somebody you make sure that

00:58:56,210 --> 00:59:00,770
they don't attack you so it is more

00:58:59,030 --> 00:59:02,240
complex than d that weather weather is a

00:59:00,770 --> 00:59:04,460
simple thing that thing if tim

00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:06,890
berners-lee would have happened in World

00:59:04,460 --> 00:59:09,650
War when and give it to everybody

00:59:06,890 --> 00:59:13,220
without licenses and have a heaven that

00:59:09,650 --> 00:59:15,680
that gives it to the public domain then

00:59:13,220 --> 00:59:16,790
there would be kick the world would have

00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:18,980
been different because there would be

00:59:16,790 --> 00:59:21,530
said okay your invention actually

00:59:18,980 --> 00:59:24,350
increases in this double Elvis world

00:59:21,530 --> 00:59:26,510
what happened and you can't litigate

00:59:24,350 --> 00:59:28,760
because you have licenses world what

00:59:26,510 --> 00:59:30,560
we're from tim berners-lee first it will

00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:34,109
be different and it could have been

00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:36,690
better but we don't know

00:59:34,109 --> 00:59:38,279
it probably wouldn't have been that big

00:59:36,690 --> 00:59:40,349
success to be Tim berners-lee would have

00:59:38,279 --> 00:59:44,549
license for more than using web is 1010

00:59:40,349 --> 00:59:48,839
box so where is also so important

00:59:44,549 --> 00:59:53,430
because it's free free as in freedom

00:59:48,839 --> 00:59:55,950
right so if it wasn't free then it

00:59:53,430 --> 00:59:59,220
wouldn't be so widespread and so

00:59:55,950 --> 01:00:03,059
Universal that is as it is today that's

00:59:59,220 --> 01:00:05,099
for sure I would actually criticize that

01:00:03,059 --> 01:00:07,289
comment slightly because there are

01:00:05,099 --> 01:00:09,900
fundamental infrastructures things that

01:00:07,289 --> 01:00:11,519
I feel free like IP or web and there are

01:00:09,900 --> 01:00:14,269
some things that I paid for like most

01:00:11,519 --> 01:00:17,130
wireless access networks 3g LTE Wi-Fi

01:00:14,269 --> 01:00:19,319
cdma you name and they're all so much

01:00:17,130 --> 01:00:22,349
great yeah there was spreads they're not

01:00:19,319 --> 01:00:25,529
Universal CD was real because there's

01:00:22,349 --> 01:00:27,989
competition automatically yeah there's

01:00:25,529 --> 01:00:30,029
competition so they can't be universal

01:00:27,989 --> 01:00:32,599
yeah that's right yeah there will be

01:00:30,029 --> 01:00:41,940
competition if they're surprised yeah

01:00:32,599 --> 01:00:43,859
but it could be still okay thank you

01:00:41,940 --> 01:00:47,460
very much for your attention I I think

01:00:43,859 --> 01:00:49,579
we can we can close this talk now thank

01:00:47,460 --> 01:00:49,579
