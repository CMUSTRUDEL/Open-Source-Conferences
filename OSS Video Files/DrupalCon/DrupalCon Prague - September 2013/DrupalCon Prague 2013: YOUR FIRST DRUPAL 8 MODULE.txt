Title: DrupalCon Prague 2013: YOUR FIRST DRUPAL 8 MODULE
Publication date: 2013-09-26
Playlist: DrupalCon Prague - September 2013
Description: 
	Drupal 8 will be a whole new animal. Module development will no longer consist of "throw hooks at it until it works" but a careful construction of services, plugins, controllers, and listeners. Keeping a Drupal 8 site happy involves fewer arrays and more objects for it to play with. And what's this HttpKernel thing?

This session will be a hands-on tour of the new systems in Drupal 8. Attendees will be walked through the process of writing a module for Drupal 8, with an exploration of the new system's architecture along the way. Also, cute animals.

TOPICS TO COVER

Services (No, not web services)
The state system
Plugins (All the things!)
Blocks (They're cool now)
Controllers and Routes
Event listeners
Configuration and deployment
Entities
WHAT TO BRING

A laptop with a working development environment
A fresh Drupal 8 checkout, already installed
A desire to get a jump on Drupal 8
Your favorite stuffed animal (You'll see why...)
