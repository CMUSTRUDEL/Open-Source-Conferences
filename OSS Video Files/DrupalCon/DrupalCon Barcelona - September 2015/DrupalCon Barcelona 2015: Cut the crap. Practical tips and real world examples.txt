Title: DrupalCon Barcelona 2015: Cut the crap. Practical tips and real world examples
Publication date: 2015-09-22
Playlist: DrupalCon Barcelona - September 2015
Description: 
	What do you like best cutting a feature before launch or rescheduling a recap meeting?

If your answer is "neither" this talk is for you. 

We've worked hard to cut the crap out of our process with some surprising, and some not so surprising results, and we'd like to share with you how we've done it. The success of your project is determined by the management of your project.

How you make decisions and explore options.
How you budget time and coordinate resources.
What tools you use.
And by tools we don't just mean "hey guys, let's use Basecamp” (barf) or “yeah, we shared that Google doc.” By tools we mean the real-world processes and strategies that ensure SUCCESSFUL projects.

When/why/and how to structure meetings (yes, you really do need to talk to people!);
How to best handle client feedback and minimize risk;
The top mistakes programmers and designers make (and how to avoid those).
We'll also share our experiences creating websites (in as little as a week) that have won competitive national awards. It’s a dash of waterfall project management, a cup of agile web development, and a pinch of lean manufacturing.

There are no technical requirements for this session. We will share how Drupal specifically helps us be more efficient, but will not be writing any code in this session.

	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,960
ok welcome thanks for coming I am going

00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:08,610
to try really hard not to pace I've told

00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,469
people before I usually walk around when

00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:11,880
I talk so if I drift away from the mic

00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:16,379
then you guys really have to throw

00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:18,420
things at me or make me stop I'm also a

00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:20,340
little bit of a little bit crazy and I

00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:21,930
talk fast and I know there's a lot of

00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:23,820
non-english speakers in the audience so

00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:25,949
if I'm talking too fast for you just

00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:28,920
raise your hand and say slow down or

00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:31,260
shout out slow down and I been married

00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:33,390
for many years now and I take criticism

00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:40,440
very well so just shout it out and I'll

00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:44,210
behave okay so I'm going to talk about

00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:48,059
good projects and I i start with the

00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:52,170
mindset that a project can be great and

00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:54,239
so over the past 20 years we've been

00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:55,440
doing all different processes we've

00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:58,260
tried all different sorts of ways to

00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:00,480
make good projects what we found is when

00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:02,940
projects fail they tend to fail for one

00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:05,129
of four reasons most of what I'm going

00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:07,470
to talk about today falls into the bed

00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:10,500
process category and that's because

00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:13,890
those other three things can be solved

00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:15,060
by a good process and and so it doesn't

00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:16,110
mean they're they're trivial and i'll

00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:17,549
talk about them all and if you have

00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:19,860
questions about any of them specifically

00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:24,060
let me know the other thing i want to

00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:25,409
say is um i'm american and we're kind of

00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:26,850
obnoxious i don't know if you know that

00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:29,040
about us but we're a little obnoxious

00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:30,540
sometimes i've been told in europe

00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,369
people are a lot more polite and don't

00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:34,229
necessarily ask questions or shout out

00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:36,119
i'm just going to say that if you feel

00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:37,890
the urge to just act american even if

00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:39,450
you're not and just like raise your hand

00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:42,180
or shout out a question in the middle of

00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:47,610
my talk please feel free to i'm totally

00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:49,439
fine with that so okay so for the past

00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:50,820
19 years my wife and I've had a

00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:52,680
multimedia company based in

00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:55,229
Massachusetts which is in the United

00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:56,700
States we do all sorts of fun stuff for

00:01:55,229 --> 00:01:58,140
all sorts of companies many of them

00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:01,049
you've heard of many of them you haven't

00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:02,640
heard of right now I'm actually on a

00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:05,240
one-year sabbatical i'm living in Siena

00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,979
with my wife and my four kids and and

00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:12,000
the reason I'm here is because we have

00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:13,230
had so much success removing waste from

00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,540
projects that

00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:17,760
I see people kind of doing projects the

00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:19,140
way we did in five years ago then I just

00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:22,200
feel really bad and I want to help

00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:24,330
people and and and so I'm here just to

00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,430
kind of spread the word and I you know I

00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:28,860
love doing this sort of stuff I love

00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:31,560
craziness I mean I mentioned I have four

00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:32,970
kids so obviously of craziness you think

00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:36,599
that's hard but it's actually really

00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:42,299
easy I mean I it's actually very easy to

00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:44,040
have four kids my goal here is I want

00:02:42,299 --> 00:02:46,349
everyone in this audience to come away

00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:47,819
with three things that will make their

00:02:46,349 --> 00:02:49,709
life easier three and they could be

00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:51,840
little things I could save five minutes

00:02:49,709 --> 00:02:53,370
a day they could save five minutes a

00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,290
week but but my goal is to make sure

00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:56,609
everyone comes away with with three

00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:58,440
things and so if you don't have those

00:02:56,609 --> 00:03:00,299
three things get me afterwards and I

00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:01,620
will spend as much time as necessary to

00:03:00,299 --> 00:03:02,700
make sure that you learn something and

00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:05,609
you can apply something to your

00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:08,040
day-to-day life here so yeah you've

00:03:05,609 --> 00:03:09,599
heard about make great what about you I

00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:12,599
just want to know kind of who's in the

00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:14,489
audience and so I'm going to ask that

00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:16,620
most people only pick one thing

00:03:14,489 --> 00:03:18,180
sometimes you have to pick two but so

00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:19,200
I'm just going to go to the list how

00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:23,940
many people here in a leadership

00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:25,049
position that's a lot all right that

00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:25,950
means you don't do anything okay now

00:03:25,049 --> 00:03:28,200
we'll get into all the people that

00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:29,730
actually do things how do people are

00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,530
logistics people they kind of keep

00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:34,650
things running on time they keep things

00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:36,950
moving a few a couple is that was like a

00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:39,810
half I've got like four and a half okay

00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:42,510
how people are communications marketing

front-end developers few okay how many

00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:57,359
people are hardcore programmers that's

00:03:56,129 --> 00:03:58,889
what I expected them all to be that's

00:03:57,359 --> 00:04:00,269
actually less than the leadership

00:03:58,889 --> 00:04:02,250
interesting I'm how do you pull er

00:04:00,269 --> 00:04:04,049

problem solving sorry challenging you

00:06:08,099 --> 00:06:14,849
like the hardest things right freedom

00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:15,960
integrating innovating other city

00:06:14,849 --> 00:06:17,310

00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:19,880

there probably is someone so if you're

00:06:27,189 --> 00:06:30,550
that person we all love you and we don't

00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:34,419
like to hire you so don't feel bad I'm

00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:36,039
not teasing you okay so the things that

00:06:34,419 --> 00:06:39,430
people usually miss when they go through

00:06:36,039 --> 00:06:40,300
this is people I mean no one shouted

00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:42,219
this out but I'm sure you're all

00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:43,719
thinking you love the recap meeting you

00:06:42,219 --> 00:06:45,069
know here's what we did last week we're

00:06:43,719 --> 00:06:48,219
going to spend a week then our talking

00:06:45,069 --> 00:06:49,749
about it as a group or when we're when

00:06:48,219 --> 00:06:50,349
we r you know working on the project and

00:06:49,749 --> 00:06:51,580
we're like you know we're going to

00:06:50,349 --> 00:06:53,199
change the functionality we're going to

00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:55,029
change the look it's time to do that

00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:56,110
we're on round seven of that I mean that

00:06:55,029 --> 00:06:57,909
when you get into the double digits

00:06:56,110 --> 00:07:01,659
that's where design revisions really get

00:06:57,909 --> 00:07:03,490
fun once it gets like 10 11 12 that's or

00:07:01,659 --> 00:07:05,259
when the marketing director leaves I

00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:06,759
mean has anyone ever been in a project

00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:09,099
or a marketing director or the project

00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:10,779
or IT director or some key point person

00:07:09,099 --> 00:07:12,159
left raise your hand if you have but

00:07:10,779 --> 00:07:13,990
halfway through a project the key person

00:07:12,159 --> 00:07:19,599
left I mean that's that's awesome right

00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:20,979
right change orders removing features I

00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:22,240
mean this is always cool i mean you eat

00:07:20,979 --> 00:07:24,129
you build this thing you've been

00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,139
stressing about it for months right and

00:07:24,129 --> 00:07:27,519
then at the last minute it's like you

00:07:26,139 --> 00:07:28,839
know we actually don't need that so all

00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:30,159
your stressors for nothing it's just a

00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:34,300
relief isn't it makes you feel good

00:07:30,159 --> 00:07:36,430
inside right or those specs I mean like

00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:39,699
the thicker the spec the better I mean I

00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:43,419
kind of use weight as my criteria as to

00:07:39,699 --> 00:07:44,409
what's the best spec possible so you

00:07:43,419 --> 00:07:45,639
know something we heard in the key

00:07:44,409 --> 00:07:47,740
notice there's got to be a better way to

00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:50,649
a lot of these processes we're using now

00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:52,209
and and I thought this was a great great

00:07:50,649 --> 00:07:54,399
quote we heard in the keynote also so I

00:07:52,209 --> 00:07:57,189
added this here I mean we have to start

00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:59,019
with the assumption that we can't

00:07:57,189 --> 00:08:00,339
predict the future I mean that's great

00:07:59,019 --> 00:08:01,629
Harry Potter there were some people that

00:08:00,339 --> 00:08:03,219
can predict the future but even that's

00:08:01,629 --> 00:08:04,719
kind of vague right i mean like you

00:08:03,219 --> 00:08:07,389
really wouldn't want to base a project

00:08:04,719 --> 00:08:08,379
plan on on Harry Potter's predictions of

00:08:07,389 --> 00:08:09,909
the future right i mean you know

00:08:08,379 --> 00:08:11,529
voldemort it's going to die in the last

00:08:09,909 --> 00:08:15,219
book but other than that like who else

00:08:11,529 --> 00:08:17,339
is going to die ok so and we need we

00:08:15,219 --> 00:08:20,740
need to change the way that we do things

00:08:17,339 --> 00:08:22,959
so I do have another question for all of

00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:25,959
you and I want to I want to ask this out

00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:29,169
there when you're sitting down and

00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:32,289
working in your day-to-day which of

00:08:29,169 --> 00:08:33,500
these things are you actually adding

00:08:32,289 --> 00:08:34,669
value to

00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:36,110
and I'm not going to go through and

00:08:34,669 --> 00:08:37,550
necessarily do a show of hands but think

00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:39,169
about it like are you writing code

00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:41,210
because you're supposed to write code

00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:42,740
are you rodent writing code for your

00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:44,930
boss so you're writing codes that's in

00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:46,430
the spec are you writing code or

00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:47,690
configuring something or managing a

00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:49,760
project or doing whatever this other

00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:52,610
thing you're doing because you're adding

00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:54,080
some sort of tangible value and and then

00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:55,910
the other question that that I think

00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,830
everyone should ask themselves at least

00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:59,420
i'm going to say at least once a week

00:08:57,830 --> 00:09:03,230
but really you should ask yourself it

00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:04,730
every hour is in the past hour in the

00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:06,440
past day in the past week have I

00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:09,020
actually done anything that contributes

00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:10,700
to the core thing I'm trying to solve or

00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:12,320
if I just been doing all of the busy

00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:14,090
work because that's what you're supposed

00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:17,660
to do and that's the structure we put

00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:19,130
around a project and so about five or

00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:20,870
six years ago we said well what if we

00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:22,970
just stop doing all the stuff that

00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:24,560
wasted time and the inspiration for this

00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:26,210
does anyone know what Habitat for

00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:28,070
Humanity is raise your hand if you've

00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:30,350
heard of it it's a really great

00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:32,270
nonprofit organization in America and

00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:35,300
what happens is people go and volunteer

00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:38,839
in low-income places to help build

00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:40,580
houses and it's really really a

00:09:38,839 --> 00:09:42,320
fascinating thing and so we as a company

00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:44,510
have gone and volunteered multiple times

00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:47,900
we've donated to them it's really

00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:49,730
rewarding it's really fun but when we

00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:52,160
were working there we are realizing this

00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:55,280
fact that habitat for humanity can build

00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:58,460
a hundred houses in a week now these

00:09:55,280 --> 00:10:01,100
houses pass code they're they're not

00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:02,839
fire hazards they're structurally sound

00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:04,730
people can live in them they have

00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:06,110
plumbing they have electricity I mean

00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:08,390
electricity starts fires and blows

00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:11,000
things up they have gas they have all

00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:12,380
this dangerous stuff they have a whole

00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,940
bunch of people that don't know what

00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:15,620
they're doing and aren't wearing

00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:19,100
hardhats has been pointed out to me

00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:21,530
before swinging hammers and nails and

00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:25,280
saws and they manage to build a hundred

00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:27,890
houses in one week and so why is there

00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:29,450
ever a twelvemonth web project and and

00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:32,360
you know I'm a little facetious because

00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:33,589
yes there that has to happen but I think

00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:36,680
the first thing we have to acknowledge

00:10:33,589 --> 00:10:39,100
is there is a lot of waste in our system

00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:41,270
and how do we get rid of that waste okay

00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:43,910
how many people are familiar with lean

00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:45,620
manufacturing Kaizen or Toyota or

00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:47,390
anything like that okay so this slide

00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:48,790
will probably not be new

00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:53,690
to a lot of you but to the rest of you

00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:55,550
this is pretty exciting so what Toyota

00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:59,900
does is it says instead of trying to

00:10:55,550 --> 00:11:01,580
make our processes shorter what we

00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:04,430
should try to do is take the things that

00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:06,080
are a waste out of the process and so if

00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:07,940
you look at our process and this is just

00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:10,340
a rough approximation of what it might

00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:12,770
look like to design and build a website

00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:16,970
if you look at it and you look at what

00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:19,850
truly adds value and then you take out

00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:21,560
everything that's not that okay so it's

00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:24,140
not about making the project shorter

00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:26,810
it's not about cutting down on time it's

00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:30,080
about focusing your time on the things

00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:33,500
that add value and so what would a

00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:36,140
project look like if we only did these

00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:37,310
four things I mean now I mean think

00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:38,930
about it think how much more rewarding

00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:40,970
your day would be think about how much

00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:43,220
more successful the project would be and

00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:46,160
so you don't have recap meetings you go

00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:48,320
live quickly it's okay not to know

00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:51,350
before you start because here's the

00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:53,690
thing we write these giant specs because

00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:56,600
we're afraid of not knowing but has

00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:58,430
anyone ever seen a spec that by the time

00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:00,380
you launch the project is actually the

00:11:58,430 --> 00:12:02,780
right thing for the project I mean I've

00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:05,690
seen projects where the spec is

00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:07,340
implemented to spec but it's never

00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:09,740
actually been the right answer when that

00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:11,390
happens and more likely halfway through

00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:14,060
someone throws out the Skip back and

00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:15,260
rewrites this back and so we have to

00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:17,030
start with the assumption that we don't

00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:18,800
actually know what the right answer is

00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:21,890
and and so you can have lots of

00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:26,630
different reactions to that right and so

00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:30,200
just out of curiosity I just look at her

00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:32,810
and her I mean you have like it's it's

00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:34,790
fear and joy right and so just out of

00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:37,220
curiosity how many people right now is

00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:39,080
I'm talking are in the fear camp and be

00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:40,340
perfectly honest raise your hand if

00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:42,020
you're in the fear camp right now as I'm

00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:43,010
saying this stuff you got a few and

00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:44,750
they're all raising your hand half way

00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:46,880
you can be bold I mean if you're in the

00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:48,770
fear camp just be like I am in the fear

00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:51,020
camp now how do you learn the excitement

00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:52,040
camp just out of curiosity okay a few

00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,370
more and then i'm guessing the other

00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:55,650
people didn't raise their hands or you

00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:57,150
in a coma because I just ate lunch or

00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:59,670
they're there somewhere in between which

00:12:57,150 --> 00:13:01,170
is fine so here's the thing the thing

00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:02,820
we're afraid of is we're afraid to

00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:05,850
change we're afraid of risk we're afraid

00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:08,100
of doing something wrong and so there's

00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:10,800
a saying which is you never get fired

00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:13,650
for hiring IBM and the theory behind

00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:15,839
that is if you hire IBM and they mess up

00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:17,850
and your boss calls you into the office

00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:20,279
and says that project was horrible you

00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:21,930
can turn around and say why hired IBM

00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:24,120
they're like the best company in the

00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:26,580
world that system integration it wasn't

00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:29,640
my fault and you and your you keep your

00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:31,080
job safe that's not a sort of the best

00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:33,510
way to do a project now I'm not saying

00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:34,890
IBM is a bad choice to hire either just

00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:35,760
to put it out there if anyone from ibm's

00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:39,690
out there you can put away your

00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:40,890
pitchforks so so what does all this look

00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:43,650
like so I'm going to give an example of

00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:45,540
a project that we did how many people

00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:48,029
had experience working in higher

00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:52,640
education in any capacity in a

00:13:48,029 --> 00:13:52,640
university or a college setting okay so

00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:58,890
when I was a graduate student I started

00:13:57,210 --> 00:14:01,500
to get involved in faculty meetings and

00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:03,959
I was completely shocked to see that in

00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:06,450
the university there is a series of

00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:08,640
about eight meetings to decide which

00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:12,660
faculty member got how many chairs in

00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:15,779
which room and and so the saying in

00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:17,790
colleges in America is they fight so

00:14:15,779 --> 00:14:20,070
much because the stakes are so low and

00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:21,720
so you're fighting for nothing so you

00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:24,050
might as well fight harder is basically

00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:26,279
the philosophy and higher education so

00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:28,709
we were called in by his nun tuck

00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:30,600
community college and this entire

00:14:28,709 --> 00:14:32,310
project was managed by a committee of 12

00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:34,860
people and we were told from the offset

00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:35,850
that these 12 people never agree there

00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:37,170
are people in the room that have

00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:40,170
literally never agreed on anything

00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:42,240
campus-wide and and they need a new

00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:43,860
website the one thing that they all seem

00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,540
to agree on is they didn't need a new

00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:47,100
website but everyone thought had a

00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:48,480
different reason for why they needed a

00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:49,560
new website now I mean we can look at

00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,060
their old website and we can come up

00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:54,480
with about a billion reasons why they

00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:56,310
need a new website and so our challenge

00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,200
was to come up with a new website which

00:14:56,310 --> 00:15:00,180
we were able to do which which this is a

00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:02,130
community college is for people that

00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:03,660
whose parents might not have gone to

00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:05,790
college it needs to be really accessible

00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:06,380
really really friendly really open

00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:08,720
really in

00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:10,760
aiding really comfortable it can't be

00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:13,220
scary this isn't a die-hard really

00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:15,770
really difficult academic college this

00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:17,330
is this is a gentle let's have a couple

00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:19,370
years get you up to the next level then

00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:21,770
you can go on to another another college

00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:23,570
and challenge yourself more and so this

00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:26,420
is the project that we built and this

00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:27,980
project went live one month after we

00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:29,510
started it from the day we kicked it off

00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:31,850
to the day it went live was one month

00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:33,380
there's 500 pages there are 12

00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:35,270
stakeholders in it and I'm going to talk

00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:37,910
a little about what that looked like and

00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:39,230
show a little bit about the roadmap I'm

00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:40,340
seeing some weird looks doesn't even

00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:45,830
want to say anything right now because

00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:52,730
you can say it if you want no okay where

00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:55,070
did I bury them okay so the first five

00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:56,630
days we had what we call a blitz now I I

00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:59,480
want to I want to i'm going to interject

00:15:56,630 --> 00:16:01,790
for a second here and say much to my

00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:04,340
embarrassment after years of mocking

00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:06,020
agile as the stupidest most useless

00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:07,940
thing in the world we've kind of become

00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:11,240
an agile shop and it's kind of

00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:13,910
surprising that being said we don't

00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:15,650
practice scrum for this types of

00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:17,870
projects that we have we actually find

00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:20,060
it to be very very slow drawn out and

00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:23,300
process heavy and so we have our own

00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:25,400
process we call it the blitz and so the

00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:29,810
way this one month project works is

00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:32,300
worked as we set up a five day blitz

00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:34,790
where day one day three so monday

00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:36,920
wednesday and friday the client was in

00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:38,780
the office with us the in-between days

00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:40,580
our team worked on things and they

00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:43,040
worked on things in their location and

00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:45,770
and the bulk of the starting work

00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:48,020
happened in those five days and then the

00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:49,400
next three weeks were polishing and

00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:50,810
filling in content and so i'm going to

00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:53,420
walk through with especially with that

00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:55,400
first week is like so during the first

00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:57,710
five days we did we got their

00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:59,690
stakeholders in the room we were adamant

00:16:57,710 --> 00:17:01,070
that anyone that might be able to change

00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:03,440
anyone that's going to disagree with the

00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:05,600
people in the room needed to be involved

00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:07,400
in the first hour and they needed to

00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,900
give some feedback on the direction of

00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:10,310
the website and what constitute a

00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:12,560
success so we got the president of the

00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:14,600
college on the phone for an hour we got

00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:18,290
a couple of high-powered Dean's in the

00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:20,260
on the call and then we had our small

00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:23,840
web team of 12 people

00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:26,060
so we set the direction we did research

00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:28,880
on how that works and we did we did user

00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:30,440
testing in those in those five days we

00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:33,800
did design with multiple rounds

00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:35,390
provision we got sign off on that design

00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:37,570
by the 12-person committee now here's

00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:40,190
the thing that's actually really awesome

00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:42,950
our designer did a little bit of prep

00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:44,870
work the day before but not a lot by the

00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:46,700
end of the first day the 12-person

00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:49,340
committee actually signed off on the

00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:50,780
direction it wasn't pixel perfect but

00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:53,000
they all said we're okay with that

00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:55,460
direction and we're okay having self

00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,350
selected two people out of our team of

00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:59,420
12 remember these are people that fought

00:17:57,350 --> 00:18:01,940
all the time two people out of our team

00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:03,710
of 12 to work out any niggling details

00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:05,480
and here's the list of stuff that are

00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:07,940
still unresolved but we trust these

00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:10,280
these three people to do it so we got it

00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:12,200
completely signed off and part of that

00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:13,820
as we showed them things and and this

00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:15,500
was a little scary for the designer the

00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:18,500
first time we did it but by this project

00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:20,420
it wasn't we showed we showed the

00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:22,190
committee things within two hours of

00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:24,290
starting to design so the designer was

00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:26,030
showing concepts very very quickly and

00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:27,200
so as soon as we had things that were

00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:28,490
going in the wrong direction we got

00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,480
feedback soon to be had things that were

00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:32,210
going the right direction we got

00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:33,560
feedback one person on that committee it

00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:36,410
was actually really fascinating because

00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:40,280
she she really didn't agree with the

00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:42,080
direction but she could see why we did

00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:45,710
it and so we are very careful as we talk

00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:47,030
about design design language is

00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:51,860
important i'm going to segue for a

00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:53,510
second i hope this is okay when you talk

00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:55,070
about design you should never talk about

00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:57,320
what someone likes you should talk about

00:18:55,070 --> 00:19:00,490
what works and so because of the way our

00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:03,740
process worked we had the core team

00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:05,270
select what is the impression we want

00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:07,060
people to feel when they come to the

00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:10,760
website and those impressions were

00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:13,580
welcomed warm friendly inviting

00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:15,170
accessible and so there was one person

00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:19,880
in particular I'm going to pop back a

00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:21,530
couple slides oops too far there's one

00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:22,970
person in particular that really didn't

00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:24,920
like the cartoons she thought the

00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:26,480
cartoons were completely inappropriate

00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:28,460
for a college she did not think they

00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:30,110
should be there and she was very felt

00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:32,690
very strongly about it but we sat down

00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:33,740
and we said these are this is this is

00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:35,570
what we agreed

00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:37,370
luding you that we wanted to convey we

00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:39,500
wanted to convey warm welcome this

00:19:37,370 --> 00:19:41,480
accessible to absolutely everyone that

00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:43,130
we we talked about you know not

00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:45,890
pretentious these are the words that we

00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:48,080
came up with and this works this solves

00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:50,600
that problem and and at the end she said

00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:52,640
you know I just don't like it but you're

00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:55,640
absolutely right it absolutely works and

00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:56,960
it's what we need to do and so we did

00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:58,880
the design to do the revisions we got

00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:03,770
sign off we did an on-site photo shoot

00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:05,840
so day one we did the designs day either

00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:07,460
day two or day for I forgot which one we

00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:10,100
sent a photographer to their location

00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:11,900
and the designs we just use stock photos

00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:13,340
and then we gave directions we have a

00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:15,410
couple photographers we've used a bunch

00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:17,030
of times that take great direction we

00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:18,620
sent them out and with the stock photos

00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:20,540
we said this is the vibe we want to get

00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:22,460
and they came back with their photos so

00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:24,200
by the by the fifth day they were

00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:29,000
actually they had their photos already

00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:30,410
taken also and and as a bonus we were

00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,700
actually able to improve their logo to

00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:33,890
they had originally said you can't touch

00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:36,170
our logo and it was too horrendous the

00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:37,970
colors were horrible and so when the

00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:39,920
designer showed the concepts I said here

00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:41,330
it is and I just had to take the color

00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:43,940
out of your logo and I just made it

00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:45,920
white on blue and and I can put the

00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:48,050
color logo back in if you guys want and

00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:49,220
everyone in the committee said no and

00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:50,809
one of the guys said I'll talk to the

00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:52,370
president tomorrow and I'll get sign off

00:20:50,809 --> 00:20:55,000
on this so it was just this we didn't

00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:57,830
fight it we just kind of showed it and

00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,990
there's a famous artist in New York City

00:20:57,830 --> 00:21:03,590
she was a performance artist laurie

00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:04,940
anderson i think her name is and and one

00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:06,800
of the things that she said is talking

00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:09,260
about art is like dancing about

00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:11,179
architecture and and you can't talk

00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:13,370
about design you need to look at design

00:21:11,179 --> 00:21:15,679
and then you can talk about what you're

00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:17,990
seeing but you can't just talk about it

00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:20,360
so yeah so also in those five days we

00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:23,270
program the templates so by day five

00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:25,250
they were entering content into their

00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:26,330
site with a template that started to

00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:28,610
look like there's it wasn't

00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:30,650
mobile-friendly yet but that's okay with

00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:32,090
their photos from their students from

00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:34,130
their photo shoot based on what they

00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:35,780
signed off on in five days they had no

00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:38,140
time to change their mind we didn't need

00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:40,670
recap beatings all that stuff went away

00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:42,559
built out a bunch of key features it

00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:44,570
turned out they didn't have a digital

00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:46,760
course catalog every other college we'd

00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:47,549
worked with up to that point had some

00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,840
sort of system

00:21:47,549 --> 00:21:50,190
that they paid for that gave them a

00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,869
course catalog and we found out on

00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:53,759
Wednesday that they didn't actually have

00:21:51,869 --> 00:21:58,559
one all they had was a PDF that was made

00:21:53,759 --> 00:22:00,179
from an excel file and so so we this is

00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:01,950
where drupal is amazing and we've done

00:22:00,179 --> 00:22:04,409
we've done this sort of projects both

00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:06,869
with Drupal and WordPress our shop uses

00:22:04,409 --> 00:22:09,210
both technologies and where drupal

00:22:06,869 --> 00:22:12,330
really shines is because you can spin up

00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:15,509
a new node type instantly we actually

00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:16,860
prototype the course catalog in under an

00:22:15,509 --> 00:22:19,379
hour and said we don't have a course

00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:21,119
catalog so we threw it together we built

00:22:19,379 --> 00:22:23,039
something they started to plug things in

00:22:21,119 --> 00:22:26,249
they actually found out that they didn't

00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:28,019
know how to cut the hierarchy of their

00:22:26,249 --> 00:22:30,090
data was so they didn't know whether the

00:22:28,019 --> 00:22:32,429
top should be majors departments

00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:34,769
programs graduate versus you know

00:22:32,429 --> 00:22:37,230
continuing education verse on campus and

00:22:34,769 --> 00:22:39,659
so they had to go back back on campus on

00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:41,190
thursday get the feedback on friday we

00:22:39,659 --> 00:22:42,720
finished off the feature and so we get

00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:44,210
that we went into this project not

00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:47,100
knowing we had to build a course catalog

00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:49,019
we no matter how much planning or how

00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:50,759
thick are spec was we probably would

00:22:49,019 --> 00:22:52,200
have missed that one but at the same

00:22:50,759 --> 00:22:53,850
time we went into this project knowing

00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:55,499
that something like that was going to

00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:57,720
happen and we had the developers ready

00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:59,369
and standing by and we talked to them we

00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:01,679
said okay what's higher priority you

00:22:59,369 --> 00:23:03,539
newsletter integration or course catalog

00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:04,889
the client said course catalog and we

00:23:03,539 --> 00:23:06,149
said great we'll make the course catalog

00:23:04,889 --> 00:23:07,919
and if they had said newsletter

00:23:06,149 --> 00:23:09,029
integration they wouldn't have a course

00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:10,769
catalog and they'd have newsletter

00:23:09,029 --> 00:23:12,840
integration but they made that decision

00:23:10,769 --> 00:23:15,989
right there on the spot based on what we

00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:17,879
were plugging in content we trained 15

00:23:15,989 --> 00:23:19,529
people out of the hundred pages in the

00:23:17,879 --> 00:23:21,779
first five days so at that point they're

00:23:19,529 --> 00:23:23,429
very comfortable with it we used to do

00:23:21,779 --> 00:23:25,980
our trainings and then let clients leave

00:23:23,429 --> 00:23:27,779
and a week later that calls up and say

00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:29,159
yeah I kind of forgot what I was doing

00:23:27,779 --> 00:23:31,139
and I need to start over in a note

00:23:29,159 --> 00:23:32,070
remember my password we wouldn't let

00:23:31,139 --> 00:23:34,710
them leave the room until they've

00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:36,119
entered a bunch of content we got them

00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:38,190
to sign off on the navigation and

00:23:36,119 --> 00:23:39,480
instead of saying are you guys okay with

00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:41,700
this navigation we said are you okay

00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:44,369
with this navigation being 80% final

00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:45,869
give us your list of concerns and then

00:23:44,369 --> 00:23:48,029
we went out and tested the concerns and

00:23:45,869 --> 00:23:49,830
came back with recommendations most of

00:23:48,029 --> 00:23:51,480
the time by the time the recommendations

00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:52,889
came back a day or two later their

00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:54,239
concerns they'd already forgotten about

00:23:52,889 --> 00:23:55,950
their concerns and they'd gone away so

00:23:54,239 --> 00:23:58,799
by the end of five days we had

00:23:55,950 --> 00:24:01,380
navigation eighty percent final we took

00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:03,720
three key departments that joined us so

00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:06,510
the second day the third day Wednesday

00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:08,130
we had actually I'm 16 people because a

00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:10,080
couple extra departments came in and we

00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:11,940
worked on their special needs because

00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:15,510
they have different departments of

00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:17,190
different needs yeah and and the other

00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:18,330
thing is the workflow that we set up for

00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:20,540
them didn't work for them as an

00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:23,250
institution point of view so we

00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:24,930
reorganized that too in terms of who can

00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:26,730
create content who can approve content

00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:28,020
for publishing things like that we had

00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:30,210
set up something where they could assign

00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:31,500
it to other people and it it wasn't

00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:33,390
working the way they wanted it to so we

00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:35,010
threw it out and again because it was

00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:37,590
Drupal we threw it out and built another

00:24:35,010 --> 00:24:38,640
one if it was WordPress not I don't

00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:40,440
think we could have built it in the same

00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:42,330
time WordPress is great don't get me

00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:44,250
wrong but this is where drupal really

00:24:42,330 --> 00:24:46,890
shines in my mind so they went live a

00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:48,330
month later they had 500 pages 825

00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:50,190
content editors which I thought was

00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:52,470
fascinating because we only trained 15

00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:54,180
so somewhere along the way they went

00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:56,100
back and trained 10 more people on

00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:57,780
campus without even asking us for help

00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:59,130
which was kind of Awesome and part of

00:24:57,780 --> 00:25:03,690
the reason for that is because we got

00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:05,280
everyone together so one of the reasons

00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:07,350
this whole process works is because of

00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:08,970
momentum and one of the great things

00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:10,560
when we talk to people about this is

00:25:08,970 --> 00:25:12,180
when they look at it they say one of the

00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:13,620
first things everyone says is I don't

00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:15,420
know if I can dedicate a week to this

00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:17,250
project I don't know how I can carve out

00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:19,740
that time we just say well look here's

00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:22,260
the option can you carve out three days

00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:27,690
in that week for this project three days

00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:30,120
is 24 hours and or would you rather

00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:31,500
carve out 80 hours over the next three

00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,880
months because those are your two

00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:34,200
options that's what it looks like the

00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,610
other way when you add all a recap

00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:38,010
meetings and all the follow-up meetings

00:25:35,610 --> 00:25:39,420
and all that other stuff and some people

00:25:38,010 --> 00:25:41,550
say hey we'd rather do it over three

00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:42,840
months and we say good luck we're

00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:45,720
probably not the company work with you

00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:47,400
and people that say let's make it happen

00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:48,900
let's do it right let's kick its butt

00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:52,080
those are the people that are the best

00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:53,490
match for us questions so far i'm going

00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:56,300
to talk i have plenty more things to go

00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:56,300
over but questions

00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:06,470
if it's remote what we do is we usually

00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:10,490
send a subset of our team to their

00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:11,750
office so so we sent one of the case

00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:13,760
studies I'll show in a little bit was in

00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:16,400
New York and so we sent four people down

00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:18,950
there for a week and so it's kind of a

00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:20,870
split as to its always this catch-22

00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:22,010
like the designer have to be in the room

00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:23,990
that the developer have to be in the

00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:25,910
room we go back and forth on it we

00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:28,130
usually find if the content and strategy

00:26:25,910 --> 00:26:29,840
and photographer or that are the three

00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:32,660
most important person people and

00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:34,820
depending on the size of the project the

00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:36,320
way our shop set up sometimes the

00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:37,640
project manager is one of those three

00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:39,380
people and sometimes it's a separate

00:26:37,640 --> 00:27:04,190
person but those are the people that we

00:26:39,380 --> 00:27:06,230
send on site basically okay so the

00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:09,050
question was how does the how does the

00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:10,250
fit work with Drupal I have two stories

00:27:09,050 --> 00:27:12,260
about that and actually interestingly

00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:14,420
they both involve WordPress but the

00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:15,470
concepts still the same right so first

00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:18,470
of all I'm going to tell you about our

00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:23,870
our failure so this project this process

00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:25,580
has completely failed once and I think

00:27:23,870 --> 00:27:26,990
in terms of a failure it was an awesome

00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:29,840
failure and I think it was actually

00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:31,190
successful failure in many ways but you

00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:33,530
guys can totally disagree with me so let

00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:36,830
me tell you the story so we were hired

00:27:33,530 --> 00:27:39,560
by a company that makes a product they

00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:42,470
had a website that had about 400 pages

00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:45,710
they ranked very very well under water

00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:48,050
water fountains and so like downstairs

00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:49,370
if there is a two-story waterfowl in or

00:27:48,050 --> 00:27:51,080
when you go to Disney World and there's

00:27:49,370 --> 00:27:53,360
a fountain spraying up stuff they make

00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:54,890
those and there's only a couple dozen

00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:57,260
companies in the in the united states

00:27:54,890 --> 00:27:58,940
that make those of this level and they

00:27:57,260 --> 00:28:00,230
they ranked very very well in google

00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:02,510
they got all their business from their

00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:04,460
website the problem was the person that

00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:07,250
maintained the website was the owner and

00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:08,690
he was also the head sales person the

00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:11,060
lead engineer and the person that did

00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:12,650
on-site installations so they had six

00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:13,970
people in the office

00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:16,160
that couldn't do any of those other

00:28:13,970 --> 00:28:17,750
things so the general manager came up to

00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:20,120
us and said we want a website in a

00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:21,860
content management system that people

00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:23,390
other than the owner can maintain and we

00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:26,540
want to help you want your help moving

00:28:23,390 --> 00:28:28,040
everything over and so we got in there

00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:30,230
and we started working for the day and

00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:32,180
we had the owner and the and the general

00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:34,400
manager there in the room and we started

00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:37,850
building out the site and the owner

00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:39,620
basically did this the whole time I can

00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:42,470
do that in front page why can't you do

00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:44,270
it front page does that I just want a

00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:46,030
table just like i did in front page and

00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:48,710
yeah I want it to be mobile two

00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:50,630
miserable miserable day just did not

00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:53,810
progress at all we built a site that is

00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:56,180
was easier quicker better to maintain

00:28:53,810 --> 00:28:58,310
flexible mobile friendly all these great

00:28:56,180 --> 00:29:00,200
things you know at the end of the day we

00:28:58,310 --> 00:29:01,760
had content in it we had a workflow we

00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:03,920
had thought about the navigation we

00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:05,540
thought about changing things but the

00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:07,490
owner just was absolutely positively

00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:09,380
wasn't happy and so we just kind of SAT

00:29:07,490 --> 00:29:11,360
him down and we said look here's the

00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:13,340
deal there's two of you in the room the

00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:15,350
general manager wants a website that

00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:17,570
anyone in the office can maintain the

00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:21,170
owner wants a website built in front

00:29:17,570 --> 00:29:22,880
page that he maintains we can't solve

00:29:21,170 --> 00:29:24,590
both those problems like that is just an

00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:26,450
insoluble problem so what we're going to

00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:27,860
do is we're going to thank you for your

00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:29,690
time we're going to refund half your

00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:31,250
money and we're going to we're going to

00:29:29,690 --> 00:29:32,660
call it a day and we're sorry we can't

00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:34,160
help you if you at some point if you

00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:36,140
have a different problem or if the

00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:37,550
general manager has a problem that you

00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:38,750
know if the owner leaves the company or

00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:40,130
something whatever we could we can work

00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:42,860
something out but that's not for us and

00:29:40,130 --> 00:29:45,500
so you know the complete technology

00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:47,660
mishmash complete needs mishmash but

00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:49,100
here's why and I might be deluding

00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:52,550
myself but here's why I think it was an

00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:53,720
amazing success a traditional project we

00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:55,400
could have been two and a half months

00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:57,080
and three quarters the way through the

00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:58,730
budget before he found that out instead

00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:02,090
we are one friggin day through the

00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:03,290
project we were we and I say one day it

00:30:02,090 --> 00:30:04,850
was a little more than one day because

00:30:03,290 --> 00:30:07,820
we had some setup we had some prep we

00:30:04,850 --> 00:30:09,590
had logistics but really I mean one day

00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:11,420
into a project we were able to decide

00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:14,360
that it was a technology mishmash and to

00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:15,530
me that was a huge huge huge win i'm

00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:17,330
going to give you another example where

00:30:15,530 --> 00:30:18,770
there's a technology mishmash and it

00:30:17,330 --> 00:30:23,360
came out kind of the opposite way and

00:30:18,770 --> 00:30:26,029
this one also was wordpress a client

00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:29,919
came to us that wanted a website that

00:30:26,029 --> 00:30:32,869
took huge amounts of data and created

00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:35,090
created a site that parse the data along

00:30:32,869 --> 00:30:38,059
a number of axes they want to chart they

00:30:35,090 --> 00:30:40,460
want two tables they wanted responses

00:30:38,059 --> 00:30:42,469
and questions it related to surveys he

00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:45,049
wanted to be able to work for thousands

00:30:42,469 --> 00:30:47,059
of surveys he knew it was a huge project

00:30:45,049 --> 00:30:48,799
he did not have the budget for so what

00:30:47,059 --> 00:30:50,539
he wanted this to do was just build

00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:53,450
something for one of his clients that

00:30:50,539 --> 00:30:54,649
was just kind of a prototype that we

00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:55,999
could kind of hold up he could deliver

00:30:54,649 --> 00:30:58,009
it to the client he's contractually

00:30:55,999 --> 00:30:59,359
obligated to do it and we could see if

00:30:58,009 --> 00:31:03,830
there's a way we could efficiently make

00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:04,999
more of them down the road and so so we

00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:06,889
sat down with them and we just started

00:31:04,999 --> 00:31:09,109
building it with standard plugins and

00:31:06,889 --> 00:31:11,749
it's it's complete brute force I mean

00:31:09,109 --> 00:31:14,029
there's each each that the site itself

00:31:11,749 --> 00:31:22,129
has let me just think about this for a

00:31:14,029 --> 00:31:25,039
second i want to say 120 pages and and

00:31:22,129 --> 00:31:27,950
most of them have one or more tables on

00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:29,299
it and then there's a little shifting

00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:31,399
thing where you can say okay only i want

00:31:29,299 --> 00:31:33,049
to see a segmented by by male versus

00:31:31,399 --> 00:31:34,849
female i want to see it segmented by age

00:31:33,049 --> 00:31:37,460
i want to segment it by this other

00:31:34,849 --> 00:31:38,719
demographic completely and totally hard

00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:41,119
code and we put it together and so we

00:31:38,719 --> 00:31:42,889
started working on it and and in the

00:31:41,119 --> 00:31:45,019
second day he came in and he's like okay

00:31:42,889 --> 00:31:46,580
what I don't get about this is it's not

00:31:45,019 --> 00:31:48,619
automated how am I going to make a lot

00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:50,059
of these and and we looked at and when

00:31:48,619 --> 00:31:51,200
we said you're going to make a lot of

00:31:50,059 --> 00:31:53,119
these by spending a hundred and fifty

00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:55,609
thousand dollars you're not right now

00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:57,469
this is that we got us for two days what

00:31:55,609 --> 00:31:58,789
we can give you is this in two days and

00:31:57,469 --> 00:32:00,919
he thought about it he said you know up

00:31:58,789 --> 00:32:03,559
that's totally worth it for me let's do

00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:05,419
this in two days and so he was totally

00:32:03,559 --> 00:32:06,979
empowered he could see where the where

00:32:05,419 --> 00:32:08,539
the faults were right there because he

00:32:06,979 --> 00:32:10,879
was in the room because we had him there

00:32:08,539 --> 00:32:13,210
did that answer your question those two

00:32:10,879 --> 00:32:13,210
stories

00:32:17,179 --> 00:32:25,769
yeah and the other thing um yeah yeah

00:32:21,929 --> 00:32:27,480
exactly fit the requirements okay so

00:32:25,769 --> 00:32:35,369
let's talk about project management a

00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:36,989
little there's another question right in

00:32:35,369 --> 00:32:38,519
that case the technology well you're

00:32:36,989 --> 00:32:40,799
saying the technology fit it's not what

00:32:38,519 --> 00:32:42,960
the owner wanted but the owner pays the

00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:44,669
bills so the technology didn't they well

00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:47,820
I mean it's semantics right at some

00:32:44,669 --> 00:32:49,499
level and it doesn't matter at some

00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:51,690
level also write like it's just not a

00:32:49,499 --> 00:32:53,309
match and and you know getting to know

00:32:51,690 --> 00:32:55,289
quickly is just as important as getting

00:32:53,309 --> 00:32:59,159
to yes quickly right I mean like the

00:32:55,289 --> 00:33:01,289
sooner you can do that the better so

00:32:59,159 --> 00:33:02,340
planning a process there's a little hand

00:33:01,289 --> 00:33:04,590
out about this I have a couple more

00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:05,759
handouts up here if I know not everyone

00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:07,830
got them but there's a few more up in

00:33:05,759 --> 00:33:09,029
front that show this timeline you know

00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:11,279
here's kind of the old school way of

00:33:09,029 --> 00:33:13,799
doing it and here's the more modern way

00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:18,749
of doing it you take everything and you

00:33:13,799 --> 00:33:20,700
just take out the waste right so who

00:33:18,749 --> 00:33:25,049
who's involved in this who's on the team

00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:26,970
you have a project manager it's harder

00:33:25,049 --> 00:33:28,710
to manage a project like this than it is

00:33:26,970 --> 00:33:30,539
kind of an old school multi-month

00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:32,340
project because you have to stay on top

00:33:30,539 --> 00:33:34,230
of everything I mean you basically have

00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:36,779
to do the same work the same productive

00:33:34,230 --> 00:33:39,059
work but you're doing it in less times

00:33:36,779 --> 00:33:42,119
you have less lag see so as a project

00:33:39,059 --> 00:33:43,739
manager you need to be your main goals

00:33:42,119 --> 00:33:46,109
are making sure that people are on track

00:33:43,739 --> 00:33:48,359
that that we're checking in on goals and

00:33:46,109 --> 00:33:51,509
time over and over and over again and

00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:52,799
that um that there's not lag between

00:33:51,509 --> 00:33:54,720
things that we're not dragging things

00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:56,940
out that were that we're making smart

00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:59,669
choices and so here's another example

00:33:56,940 --> 00:34:01,139
one of our clients came to us after the

00:33:59,669 --> 00:34:03,480
contract was signed we got into the

00:34:01,139 --> 00:34:05,340
kickoff meeting and in our first

00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:08,010
strategy meeting which had the president

00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:09,569
and everything in the room one of the

00:34:08,010 --> 00:34:12,000
people said I really want to feature

00:34:09,569 --> 00:34:13,109
where if someone goes to an event they

00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,089
can click a button and they'll get a

00:34:13,109 --> 00:34:16,530
reminder a week before an email I saw it

00:34:15,089 --> 00:34:18,240
on some other so I guess I'm sure

00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:20,399
someone's heard this before I saw it on

00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:23,069
a different site and I wanted an arse to

00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:24,960
and I mean again old school we would

00:34:23,069 --> 00:34:26,760
have said huh that wasn't in the spec

00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:28,190
that wasn't in the contract now we have

00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:30,200
to look at scope now we have to

00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:32,569
this other thing instead what we did is

00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:35,419
we do this exercise we call it sticky

00:34:32,569 --> 00:34:37,490
buckets and we have little post-it notes

00:34:35,419 --> 00:34:39,710
little sticky notes and we have a red

00:34:37,490 --> 00:34:41,270
one a green one at yellow one and a blue

00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:43,760
one and the green one means it's really

00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:45,260
easy less than two hours the yellow one

00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:47,569
means it's a little harder less than

00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:49,280
five hours red means it's more than five

00:34:47,569 --> 00:34:50,839
hours and blue means we just have

00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:53,089
absolutely no idea we'll need to figure

00:34:50,839 --> 00:34:54,859
it out so we took that idea it's nothing

00:34:53,089 --> 00:34:57,319
we've ever done before we just wrote it

00:34:54,859 --> 00:34:58,910
on the blue sticky pads the whole team

00:34:57,319 --> 00:35:00,410
got together and prioritized and that

00:34:58,910 --> 00:35:02,300
was high on the list so we sent one of

00:35:00,410 --> 00:35:04,609
the developers into the other room they

00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:06,980
went found a module plugged it in it had

00:35:04,609 --> 00:35:08,329
a couple of issues that really didn't we

00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:10,069
just weren't sure whether it is right or

00:35:08,329 --> 00:35:11,630
not so we showed it to the client and we

00:35:10,069 --> 00:35:13,670
said look you got three choices right

00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:16,010
now you can say no to this feature you

00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:17,270
can use it kind of as is with the

00:35:16,010 --> 00:35:19,970
plug-in but we'll make it look a little

00:35:17,270 --> 00:35:22,040
prettier or we can invest another 5 or

00:35:19,970 --> 00:35:24,020
10 hours in in building a custom

00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:25,099
solution for it and the client said oh

00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:26,450
you know the module is good enough

00:35:25,099 --> 00:35:28,130
that's fine there's these other things

00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:31,010
that are higher priority so again it's

00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:34,490
it's about figuring out what those what

00:35:31,010 --> 00:35:37,819
those goals are so keeping in control

00:35:34,490 --> 00:35:39,740
being assertive one thing that's really

00:35:37,819 --> 00:35:41,329
important for the project manager to do

00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:43,849
in a project like this is to make sure

00:35:41,329 --> 00:35:45,650
there aren't hidden stakeholders so if a

00:35:43,849 --> 00:35:48,560
client says something like ah you know I

00:35:45,650 --> 00:35:50,960
have to run that by Jim then the PM has

00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:52,490
to say I'll be on the call with you and

00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:53,690
we'll do that right now don't go back to

00:35:52,490 --> 00:35:55,579
your office and do it let's get on the

00:35:53,690 --> 00:35:57,230
phone right now with Jim because if Jim

00:35:55,579 --> 00:35:59,329
can derail this project if you really

00:35:57,230 --> 00:36:00,680
need Jim's impa he should have been in

00:35:59,329 --> 00:36:02,510
the room in the first place and let's

00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:04,339
not wait till the end of the project to

00:36:02,510 --> 00:36:06,170
to fix that the minute you see that

00:36:04,339 --> 00:36:07,790
wrong you need to jump on it and that's

00:36:06,170 --> 00:36:09,770
part of the role the project manager and

00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:11,420
they have to do all this while being

00:36:09,770 --> 00:36:13,280
flexible and knowing that every single

00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:16,670
thing on their plan might change which

00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:22,160
is scary and exciting and absolutely

00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:25,250
awesome so yeah you need to know roles

00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:28,550
so you know here's an example of what a

00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:30,020
roadmap look like for for that project I

00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:31,310
was just talking about and you could see

00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:35,210
you know there's a surprise feature in

00:36:31,310 --> 00:36:37,130
there and and and so part of what we did

00:36:35,210 --> 00:36:39,349
with with the cut with the course

00:36:37,130 --> 00:36:41,270
catalog is we said flat out hey we have

00:36:39,349 --> 00:36:43,070
a maintenance budget for you

00:36:41,270 --> 00:36:44,480
can we can get this to completion if we

00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:47,030
can tap into that maintenance budget

00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:48,620
right now and they huddled and talked

00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:50,060
about it in five minutes later we had an

00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:52,790
answer and we just kept rolling and kept

00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:54,320
momentum and this is what the first day

00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:56,570
look like and you can see as a project

00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:58,520
manager you need to keep people to the

00:36:56,570 --> 00:37:01,070
schedule but you also need to change the

00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:03,620
schedule so if things happen sooner or

00:37:01,070 --> 00:37:05,300
quicker then you need to handle this and

00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:07,400
I think if anyone needs these slides

00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:08,720
afterwards you can come and grab me and

00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:11,950
I'll email them to you or whatever i'll

00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:11,950
post them on twitter or something and

00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:19,580
then the the team's let me talk briefly

00:37:16,490 --> 00:37:21,140
about the group's um we make a

00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:22,520
distinction between sometimes to call

00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:24,170
visionaries sometimes to call them

00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:25,580
stakeholders it really depends on the

00:37:24,170 --> 00:37:28,820
organization we're in and which one's

00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:31,820
going to get the best the best play but

00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:33,860
we make a distinction between people

00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:35,810
that set the direction and people that

00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:37,280
have important perspective and a lot of

00:37:35,810 --> 00:37:40,310
times we'll have clients that I'll say

00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:41,690
something like yeah we're just not going

00:37:40,310 --> 00:37:42,920
to let him in the room or we're not

00:37:41,690 --> 00:37:44,750
going to let her in the room because

00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:47,210
last time they totally derailed the

00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:49,100
project and we say is ok let's change

00:37:47,210 --> 00:37:51,170
that around let's bring them in on

00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:53,570
Wednesday and get their feedback and we

00:37:51,170 --> 00:37:55,460
control that conversation because we're

00:37:53,570 --> 00:37:57,590
really good at it and we'll bring them

00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:59,510
in and we'll say hey look here was

00:37:57,590 --> 00:38:01,490
here's the goal and these are the goals

00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:03,230
of the site and these were set down by

00:38:01,490 --> 00:38:05,180
this group in the room plus the

00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:06,950
president of the university + boom boom

00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:09,200
boom boom boom these are the goals we

00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:11,210
came up with this is how we set out to

00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:13,730
achieve it we've heard you're someone

00:38:11,210 --> 00:38:16,310
that has a lot of input can you please

00:38:13,730 --> 00:38:18,980
let us know for missing anything on this

00:38:16,310 --> 00:38:20,270
direction and so one example of that is

00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:21,470
there is one site we were doing that we

00:38:20,270 --> 00:38:23,480
brought someone in that they were trying

00:38:21,470 --> 00:38:25,100
to keep out of the room and the person

00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:26,930
said well one thing that I see that

00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:29,180
you're missing is twenty percent of the

00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:31,040
people that call our office only speak

00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:33,050
Spanish and we can't necessarily help

00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:35,480
that population so it's not core to our

00:38:33,050 --> 00:38:37,640
mission but we could put something up

00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:39,860
for them on the website fairly easily

00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:42,350
and so again halfway through the project

00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:44,300
we find this new thing I mean how hard

00:38:42,350 --> 00:38:45,350
is it to add three pages in Spanish as

00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:47,600
long as you have someone that speaks

00:38:45,350 --> 00:38:49,250
Spanish and so we're instantly able to

00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:51,340
correct for that so that person that in

00:38:49,250 --> 00:38:54,250
the past had always been the roadblock

00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:56,500
becomes becomes a great asset and

00:38:54,250 --> 00:38:58,210
and and so we take those things we test

00:38:56,500 --> 00:39:04,750
the heck out of them we do all sorts of

00:38:58,210 --> 00:39:08,950
fun testing okay so why do projects fail

00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:11,020
ego and fear is unknown process so if

00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:13,150
the reason your projects failing is

00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:15,330
because you don't actually know what

00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:17,890
you're doing and you're afraid to say it

00:39:15,330 --> 00:39:21,070
there are a few things you can do to get

00:39:17,890 --> 00:39:23,110
help with that right but we often find

00:39:21,070 --> 00:39:24,940
more often the reason projects fails

00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:27,610
because of bad processes and the way to

00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:29,170
fix it bad process is to just get into

00:39:27,610 --> 00:39:34,540
an iteration loop as quickly as possible

00:39:29,170 --> 00:39:35,710
and so there are definitely cases where

00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:37,180
project fails because someone just

00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:38,680
doesn't know how to write the code and

00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:40,450
that's the left hand side and if that's

00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:42,330
your problem the project manager should

00:39:40,450 --> 00:39:45,850
recognize it and remedy that situation

00:39:42,330 --> 00:39:46,960
but it but more often I'm saying the

00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:49,510
same thing but I'm saying it hopefully

00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:51,370
more articulately this time more often

00:39:49,510 --> 00:39:52,510
when a project fails we see it fails

00:39:51,370 --> 00:39:54,610
because you're asking the wrong

00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:56,560
questions or you're jumping to

00:39:54,610 --> 00:39:59,620
conclusions or you're trying to I mean

00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:01,300
12 people can never answer a question 12

00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:03,910
people the goal of 12 people in a room

00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:05,470
is to find questions and then we pull

00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:06,730
out those questions and we ask other

00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:09,760
people those questions and we get

00:40:06,730 --> 00:40:11,380
feedback my wife who's who's basically

00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:15,400
smarter and better at me that at

00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:17,350
everything she says that your brand is

00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:19,120
not what you say it is it's what your

00:40:17,350 --> 00:40:20,980
customer says it is it's what anyone

00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:22,210
else says your brand is and the same

00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:24,910
thing with your site and with usability

00:40:22,210 --> 00:40:26,340
so you need to put your ego aside need

00:40:24,910 --> 00:40:29,710
to get the right people in the room

00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:31,540
again talking about ego how many people

00:40:29,710 --> 00:40:33,610
have worked with a designer that when

00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:36,880
you gave them feedback got mad at you I

00:40:33,610 --> 00:40:39,820
mean right there's no place for

00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:41,670
designers like that I have this I have

00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:44,320
this philosophy that a lot of designers

00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:45,880
want to be artists they want to have

00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:48,190
their stuff hung and museums and they

00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:49,840
can't get there so they're just grumpily

00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:51,160
being a graphic designer because that's

00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:53,410
the closest thing that actually pays

00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:55,420
okay and no matter how talented they are

00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:56,890
you never want to work with them the

00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:59,260
person you want to work with is a person

00:40:56,890 --> 00:41:00,970
that says wow that's cool let me try

00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:02,950
that or I don't think that will work

00:41:00,970 --> 00:41:04,900
because of this but let me try that and

00:41:02,950 --> 00:41:06,850
so when in terms of who's on your team

00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:07,750
from a designer you want someone that's

00:41:06,850 --> 00:41:09,790
just going to try

00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:13,420
I absolutely anything and give good

00:41:09,790 --> 00:41:14,500
feedback I just saw I wish I could

00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:16,420
remember the person's name and I'm

00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:18,460
embarrassed that I don't so my blog

00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:22,270
Jason on design i just posted an article

00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:24,760
if any one hires designers about the the

00:41:22,270 --> 00:41:26,320
four stages of design and i found this

00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:28,240
great article online where someone kind

00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:30,160
of articulated where people are and

00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:31,120
where people get stuck and there's

00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:33,820
people that are really talented

00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:35,620
designers that never become great and he

00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:37,000
kind of outlines where that gap is and

00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:38,590
it's really exciting so if you're having

00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:41,230
frustrating designer experiences you

00:41:38,590 --> 00:41:45,040
should look that up low ego flexible

00:41:41,230 --> 00:41:46,750
confident an expert and they need to

00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:48,910
have creativity on demand they need to

00:41:46,750 --> 00:41:50,980
not be afraid to try something and show

00:41:48,910 --> 00:41:52,800
it 15 minutes later otherwise they can't

00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:56,010
they can't work as part of this team

00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:58,990
development again low ego and flexible

00:41:56,010 --> 00:42:01,120
enjoys helping prefer simple solution so

00:41:58,990 --> 00:42:04,810
here's the problem with developers and I

00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:06,040
that came out wrong there's more than

00:42:04,810 --> 00:42:09,940
one problem with developers no kidding

00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:12,460
oh so two interesting tidbits about

00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:15,250
developers right the first one is

00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:16,450
they've done they've done surveys where

00:42:15,250 --> 00:42:18,040
they go and they asked people and they

00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:21,250
say how long do you think it would take

00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:23,430
you to go to the market and buy milk and

00:42:21,250 --> 00:42:26,830
come back home and they asked people and

00:42:23,430 --> 00:42:28,630
believe it or not engineers are the

00:42:26,830 --> 00:42:31,150
worst at estimating that out of pretty

00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:33,460
much any profession out there right

00:42:31,150 --> 00:42:34,990
because they always look at and and I

00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:37,060
think there's two reasons for that right

00:42:34,990 --> 00:42:39,220
but I think the biggest reason is

00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:40,570
because they're optimist so an engineer

00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:42,610
looks at a problem and says there's

00:42:40,570 --> 00:42:44,590
going to be an elegant solution to that

00:42:42,610 --> 00:42:47,020
and I'm going to do that elegant

00:42:44,590 --> 00:42:48,280
solution and and that's great but it

00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:50,530
doesn't always work out that way okay so

00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:52,630
there's one tidbit about developers the

00:42:50,530 --> 00:42:55,150
second tidbit about developers is if

00:42:52,630 --> 00:42:56,710
you're a developer you like complex

00:42:55,150 --> 00:42:58,420
problems I mean you'd be a horrible

00:42:56,710 --> 00:42:59,860
developer if you didn't someone back

00:42:58,420 --> 00:43:01,690
there said they liked who was it that

00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:02,920
said they liked tricky problems and if

00:43:01,690 --> 00:43:04,540
you're a developer raise your hand if

00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:06,010
you like tricky problems I mean right i

00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:09,220
means you're a good developer that's a

00:43:06,010 --> 00:43:10,900
good thing but the downside with that is

00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:13,570
if you have something that's really easy

00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:16,440
it's not fun for you so how do you make

00:43:13,570 --> 00:43:20,590
it fun for you you make it really

00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:21,200
complicated right and so in order for a

00:43:20,590 --> 00:43:23,930
blitz

00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:26,240
in it or any sort of sprint like this or

00:43:23,930 --> 00:43:27,980
prototyping go well you need to have

00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:30,200
someone that actually prefers simple

00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:31,460
solutions to complex solutions and I was

00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:35,270
really impressed because the talk I was

00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:38,870
just at um i was by i think was aqueous

00:43:35,270 --> 00:43:42,380
first first employee Gavin gabon is that

00:43:38,870 --> 00:43:43,730
one had got boy there it is and and I

00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:45,290
expected it to be like super super

00:43:43,730 --> 00:43:46,370
technical and way over my head and he's

00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:48,320
like here's how you use the

00:43:46,370 --> 00:43:50,450
configuration function and it was very

00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:52,160
much like I understood everything up

00:43:50,450 --> 00:43:54,050
there and I'm not a developer at all and

00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:55,940
I just thought it was this this like

00:43:54,050 --> 00:43:57,470
plateau where you're like you're a bad

00:43:55,940 --> 00:43:58,880
program or you're an okay program you're

00:43:57,470 --> 00:44:02,320
a great programmer and then you don't

00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:05,000
even have to program and he's like oh

00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:08,330
and so again this idea of preferring

00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:09,860
simple solutions um and they have to be

00:44:08,330 --> 00:44:11,990
an expert at the tools they use so it

00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:13,610
would be a nightmare for a drupal

00:44:11,990 --> 00:44:15,560
developer to try to do a blitz in

00:44:13,610 --> 00:44:17,000
wordpress or vice versa or something

00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:20,270
like that I mean that just wouldn't work

00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:22,280
and and is comfortable using modules to

00:44:20,270 --> 00:44:24,110
get get a good start now the modules

00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:25,820
might not be the bet be all end all but

00:44:24,110 --> 00:44:28,100
in that first five days if we can work

00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:30,590
out the whole flow in modules then the

00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:31,790
next week developer can go and work out

00:44:30,590 --> 00:44:32,570
the details and figure out now we

00:44:31,790 --> 00:44:34,460
actually have something that were

00:44:32,570 --> 00:44:38,000
prototyping and poking at and seeing we

00:44:34,460 --> 00:44:42,290
can get it to the next step so we kind

00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:44,060
of need everyone to be an expert and so

00:44:42,290 --> 00:44:45,830
what's tricky about that is like what's

00:44:44,060 --> 00:44:47,480
what's an expert from the client point

00:44:45,830 --> 00:44:49,400
of view you know if you're working with

00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:52,190
a sales department or customer service

00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:53,900
department or the operations expert they

00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:55,250
they're not going to be an expert at web

00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:57,440
development they're not going to be an

00:44:55,250 --> 00:44:59,840
expert at design or branding or user

00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:01,280
interaction or user experience or any of

00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:03,110
those things so what are they an expert

00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:05,060
at and and one thing I want to put out

00:45:03,110 --> 00:45:07,160
there is if someone comes to you with

00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:09,860
answers there a sales person not an

00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:16,160
expert right so experts ax question so

00:45:09,860 --> 00:45:19,130
here's an example of it take a look at

00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:20,540
this this picture here okay so does

00:45:19,130 --> 00:45:22,490
anyone know which test one has anyone

00:45:20,540 --> 00:45:26,600
seen that website it's super cool isn't

00:45:22,490 --> 00:45:28,640
it oh it's amazing so what they've done

00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:30,410
there so which test one collects tests

00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:32,750
like this so we're going to do a show of

00:45:30,410 --> 00:45:34,450
hands here which test one looked at this

00:45:32,750 --> 00:45:36,579
and said which

00:45:34,450 --> 00:45:38,859
which one converts better the one with

00:45:36,579 --> 00:45:42,760
the icons across the top and the text or

00:45:38,859 --> 00:45:45,339
the one without the icons and so I just

00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:48,040
gave away the answer darn it ok I will

00:45:45,339 --> 00:45:49,240
have to go to the next one and so ok so

00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:51,670
let's do this one I won't click any

00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:54,670
farther on this one I guarantee ok so

00:45:51,670 --> 00:45:56,349
which one's more effective a or b so

00:45:54,670 --> 00:45:58,030
we're going to have a vote ready so the

00:45:56,349 --> 00:46:00,010
only difference is the color black and

00:45:58,030 --> 00:46:01,900
the words I mean they're very subtly

00:46:00,010 --> 00:46:03,640
different right so which one of these

00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:06,970
converted better if you think it was a

00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:09,480
raise your hand got a few if you think

00:46:06,970 --> 00:46:17,859
it was being raised your hand okay

00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:19,329
dominant is d oh ok next one oh my gosh

00:46:17,859 --> 00:46:24,280
I totally screwed up this slide I

00:46:19,329 --> 00:46:27,820
shouldn't have looked at ok wait here we

00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:29,650
go let's go to this one ok so so which

00:46:27,820 --> 00:46:31,390
one of these emails converted better and

00:46:29,650 --> 00:46:32,589
they have basically the same content but

00:46:31,390 --> 00:46:34,540
you can see their percentage so

00:46:32,589 --> 00:46:36,670
differently one is an HTML one with a

00:46:34,540 --> 00:46:38,320
lot of graphics this is an opt-in email

00:46:36,670 --> 00:46:41,260
so people have asked to get this email

00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:42,880
and one is plain text and they just they

00:46:41,260 --> 00:46:45,130
didn't ask before they wanted plain text

00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:47,500
or not they just a be tested it and so

00:46:45,130 --> 00:46:48,910
um so the question then becomes which

00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:50,380
one converted more and so raise your

00:46:48,910 --> 00:46:52,450
hands if you think it's a plain text one

00:46:50,380 --> 00:46:56,950
and raise your hands if you think it's

00:46:52,450 --> 00:46:58,089
the graphical one ok so now look at

00:46:56,950 --> 00:47:02,890
those conversion numbers that's

00:46:58,089 --> 00:47:04,690
absolutely friggin huge ok so so here's

00:47:02,890 --> 00:47:07,630
this is the example that I give to

00:47:04,690 --> 00:47:08,859
clients when they don't want to bring

00:47:07,630 --> 00:47:11,980
someone in that has a different opinion

00:47:08,859 --> 00:47:13,599
than them because I'm just going to go

00:47:11,980 --> 00:47:14,470
out there and say I think most of the

00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:17,200
people in this room are pretty darn

00:47:14,470 --> 00:47:18,940
smart did anyone get both of those right

00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:21,400
I wish I could have done three because

00:47:18,940 --> 00:47:23,530
you got one person got two people got

00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:25,540
both of them right I mean I've when I do

00:47:23,530 --> 00:47:27,250
all three very rarely does a room this

00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:28,390
size get any of get get all three of

00:47:27,250 --> 00:47:31,000
them right I mean it's just amazing

00:47:28,390 --> 00:47:32,980
right so again experts are people that

00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,300
ask questions and so you want to get

00:47:32,980 --> 00:47:35,740
people in the room you want to be open

00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:37,000
to that and again it comes down to

00:47:35,740 --> 00:47:40,089
project management which is good because

00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:41,470
we have a lot of leaders in here and so

00:47:40,089 --> 00:47:44,740
the trick of the project manager is to

00:47:41,470 --> 00:47:46,869
focus them and to not let people get

00:47:44,740 --> 00:47:48,190
stuck in the quagmire of questions I

00:47:46,869 --> 00:47:49,510
mean any time anyone has a back

00:47:48,190 --> 00:47:52,630
so here's a great example we're working

00:47:49,510 --> 00:47:54,490
with the department since our higher at

00:47:52,630 --> 00:47:55,510
example i wish i wish i can think of

00:47:54,490 --> 00:47:56,800
another one right now but i'm just going

00:47:55,510 --> 00:48:02,140
to go with this so we're working with

00:47:56,800 --> 00:48:04,329
with Dartmouth College and and the room

00:48:02,140 --> 00:48:05,560
was very evenly divided as to what

00:48:04,329 --> 00:48:07,630
should happen this is for a specific

00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:09,940
department what should happen in the

00:48:07,630 --> 00:48:11,230
department web page and half the people

00:48:09,940 --> 00:48:14,260
thought there should be a section that

00:48:11,230 --> 00:48:15,970
said specifically just for students just

00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:18,819
for guidance counselor's just for

00:48:15,970 --> 00:48:20,230
parents just for alumni just for and

00:48:18,819 --> 00:48:22,060
there are a few different categories and

00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:23,589
the other half for thought very strongly

00:48:22,060 --> 00:48:24,640
that's horrible they wanted it clean and

00:48:23,589 --> 00:48:28,089
simple so you have the clean and simple

00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:29,680
clamp camp and you have the lots of

00:48:28,089 --> 00:48:33,819
clear buttons camp and so they were

00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:35,920
going back and forth so we just said it

00:48:33,819 --> 00:48:36,940
guys we're going to take this question

00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:38,530
and we're going to we're going to come

00:48:36,940 --> 00:48:40,329
back to it in two days when we regroup

00:48:38,530 --> 00:48:42,069
we fouché captured it we've talked about

00:48:40,329 --> 00:48:45,160
it enough let's just take it away and

00:48:42,069 --> 00:48:46,690
regroup and so we got in the car we had

00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:48,880
about a two-hour drive back to her

00:48:46,690 --> 00:48:50,680
office so we got in the car and before

00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:53,380
we lost cell reception we called up the

00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:56,260
office and got one of our developers on

00:48:53,380 --> 00:48:58,089
the phone and what they did was they

00:48:56,260 --> 00:49:01,960
went to the current website which was

00:48:58,089 --> 00:49:03,609
absolutely horrendous and they hacked

00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:05,710
those buttons into it so it didn't look

00:49:03,609 --> 00:49:07,660
too ugly didn't look much uglier than it

00:49:05,710 --> 00:49:09,099
already looked but it actually had those

00:49:07,660 --> 00:49:10,990
buttons in there and all of them linked

00:49:09,099 --> 00:49:12,700
somewhere so by the time we got back to

00:49:10,990 --> 00:49:14,170
the office they had that programmed we

00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:16,329
sent it to their current web steam and

00:49:14,170 --> 00:49:18,280
we said hey can you replace this line of

00:49:16,329 --> 00:49:21,700
code with this line of code on the

00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:23,770
current site for a week one week later

00:49:21,700 --> 00:49:25,390
we had data and what the data showed is

00:49:23,770 --> 00:49:27,460
only one of those buttons ever got

00:49:25,390 --> 00:49:29,140
kicked clicked on so what do we do we

00:49:27,460 --> 00:49:30,880
put that button in the navigation and

00:49:29,140 --> 00:49:32,380
the decision is completely gone and so

00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:34,150
again when you get a bunch of people in

00:49:32,380 --> 00:49:35,589
the room you want to keep in mind your

00:49:34,150 --> 00:49:39,480
goal of having those people in the room

00:49:35,589 --> 00:49:39,480
is to ask questions not to find answers

00:49:39,750 --> 00:49:42,750
okay

00:49:45,110 --> 00:49:49,220
so I'm going to do a couple quick

00:49:46,950 --> 00:49:51,750
examples and then some more questions so

00:49:49,220 --> 00:49:55,170
this was a project we did in a month

00:49:51,750 --> 00:49:57,060
complete redesign increase doubled two

00:49:55,170 --> 00:50:01,050
and a half times and had a 4-fold

00:49:57,060 --> 00:50:02,790
increase in six months here's what a

00:50:01,050 --> 00:50:04,800
two-week project looks like it's a much

00:50:02,790 --> 00:50:06,870
smaller team we did print material as

00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:09,570
well as a website this is maybe a 30

00:50:06,870 --> 00:50:11,850
page website with a very very difficult

00:50:09,570 --> 00:50:13,770
Board of Directors we got their board of

00:50:11,850 --> 00:50:17,370
directors to self nominate a

00:50:13,770 --> 00:50:18,840
representative to come and and they were

00:50:17,370 --> 00:50:20,370
pretty happy they've never really

00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:22,530
managed their board of directors that

00:50:20,370 --> 00:50:24,060
well before this was a one week project

00:50:22,530 --> 00:50:25,290
this one might have even been in

00:50:24,060 --> 00:50:27,450
Squarespace which we use sometimes

00:50:25,290 --> 00:50:30,930
because use the easiest tool possible

00:50:27,450 --> 00:50:32,040
right this also applies to big projects

00:50:30,930 --> 00:50:33,150
and so one thing I want to point out

00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:36,720
again I was thinking about this during

00:50:33,150 --> 00:50:38,640
the keynote WordPress has a lot of

00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:40,350
issues one of their issues is it has a

00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:42,180
really friggin big code base because

00:50:40,350 --> 00:50:43,920
ever it always supports everything in

00:50:42,180 --> 00:50:46,050
the past and it never gets rid of

00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:47,850
versions but but if you do a Google

00:50:46,050 --> 00:50:49,920
Trends to see what what gets the most

00:50:47,850 --> 00:50:52,950
searches you see WordPress blows away

00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:54,150
Drupal and and so you know we're talking

00:50:52,950 --> 00:50:55,950
about with Drupal going to this thing

00:50:54,150 --> 00:50:57,600
where we won't be holding up releases

00:50:55,950 --> 00:50:58,680
for every single feature where it

00:50:57,600 --> 00:51:00,300
presses have been doing that for a while

00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:01,470
and I don't think it's a coincidence i

00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:03,120
really do think that's one of the

00:51:01,470 --> 00:51:06,960
reasons why they're able to maintain

00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:08,340
their their market lead I thought this

00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:09,600
was a great quote that someone had on of

00:51:08,340 --> 00:51:13,110
this person in the room I don't even

00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:14,430
know it's a great quote here's a project

00:51:13,110 --> 00:51:17,630
we did for a client a month long project

00:51:14,430 --> 00:51:21,540
for a for Yale and Johnson & Johnson

00:51:17,630 --> 00:51:23,130
first month we built it and the whole

00:51:21,540 --> 00:51:25,290
data component of it completely failed

00:51:23,130 --> 00:51:27,270
second month we brought in there we had

00:51:25,290 --> 00:51:29,010
brought in one of our PHP developers and

00:51:27,270 --> 00:51:31,140
a freelance PHP drupal developer that

00:51:29,010 --> 00:51:33,630
have been using Drupal for seven years

00:51:31,140 --> 00:51:35,490
and are definitely been using it for a

00:51:33,630 --> 00:51:38,010
couple years built the whole thing

00:51:35,490 --> 00:51:39,960
failed again third month we scrapped

00:51:38,010 --> 00:51:42,210
everything they did and a site builder

00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:44,580
who only been using Drupal for five or

00:51:42,210 --> 00:51:46,860
six months went in and rebuilt it using

00:51:44,580 --> 00:51:48,780
modules and we needed I don't know I

00:51:46,860 --> 00:51:49,860
want to say like 100 lines of PHP code

00:51:48,780 --> 00:51:52,500
at the end of the day and it worked

00:51:49,860 --> 00:51:53,790
flawlessly this was a longer project

00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:55,170
than some of those other ones and then

00:51:53,790 --> 00:51:56,490
it took about 10 months of burnham

00:51:55,170 --> 00:51:56,849
before we actually got everything we

00:51:56,490 --> 00:51:58,170
were

00:51:56,849 --> 00:52:01,700
constantly iterating and constantly

00:51:58,170 --> 00:52:05,940
growing but again all different sizes so

00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:08,339
okay so i am going to we just fly

00:52:05,940 --> 00:52:09,450
through a couple of these momentum is

00:52:08,339 --> 00:52:11,190
important you might have gotten that

00:52:09,450 --> 00:52:15,150
from me of course i'm slowing down here

00:52:11,190 --> 00:52:16,319
so there you go one thing i want to

00:52:15,150 --> 00:52:17,759
share so a lot of times people hear this

00:52:16,319 --> 00:52:20,009
in there like that's great but it would

00:52:17,759 --> 00:52:21,839
never work at my organization this has

00:52:20,009 --> 00:52:23,369
worked at so many organizations that

00:52:21,839 --> 00:52:24,660
I've seen you just have to get the right

00:52:23,369 --> 00:52:26,579
people in the room and frame it the

00:52:24,660 --> 00:52:29,009
right way and what Toyota recommends is

00:52:26,579 --> 00:52:31,619
you just start small you pick one little

00:52:29,009 --> 00:52:33,720
battle that will have big big big good

00:52:31,619 --> 00:52:35,489
outcome and you do it and then you start

00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:38,940
sharing it and go to the next go to the

00:52:35,489 --> 00:52:42,869
next step okay there's some hints on the

00:52:38,940 --> 00:52:44,099
table there's handouts and I have a few

00:52:42,869 --> 00:52:45,989
minutes left for questions sorry I'm

00:52:44,099 --> 00:52:48,410
running a little later i digressed so

00:52:45,989 --> 00:52:48,410
who has questions

00:53:13,290 --> 00:53:17,260
right so you have a stakeholder I'll

00:53:15,730 --> 00:53:18,580
come in and say I want to discuss it and

00:53:17,260 --> 00:53:19,750
I want to involve the whole team and I

00:53:18,580 --> 00:53:22,750
want the whole marketing team involved

00:53:19,750 --> 00:53:24,280
and I want a billion people involved so

00:53:22,750 --> 00:53:26,860
first of all we work really hard to make

00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:29,910
sure we get the right people time held

00:53:26,860 --> 00:53:33,010
on their calendar early enough and so

00:53:29,910 --> 00:53:36,790
we'll ask our clients things like hey is

00:53:33,010 --> 00:53:37,870
the is your director prone to bring in a

00:53:36,790 --> 00:53:39,370
bunch of people and ask a lot of

00:53:37,870 --> 00:53:42,040
questions if so who are the people they

00:53:39,370 --> 00:53:43,630
bring in the most can they all hold two

00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:45,190
hours on their schedule the same two

00:53:43,630 --> 00:53:47,080
hours and Wednesday afternoon and we'll

00:53:45,190 --> 00:53:49,000
call them if we do have questions and so

00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:51,040
this goes back to the project management

00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:52,660
side of it figure anyone you anyone you

00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:53,920
have a very good chance of needing and

00:53:52,660 --> 00:53:56,590
make sure you block off at least a

00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:57,940
little time and so this this is what we

00:53:56,590 --> 00:54:00,760
this is what we use the perspective

00:53:57,940 --> 00:54:03,280
group for the second thing is our

00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:05,680
process is really focused on getting

00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:07,870
stakeholders to say words listening to

00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:10,720
those words and repeating back the right

00:54:07,870 --> 00:54:12,490
answer using their own words and so

00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:14,170
instead of saying what do you think of

00:54:12,490 --> 00:54:15,850
this design like first of all we try

00:54:14,170 --> 00:54:18,130
very hard to make sure that only our

00:54:15,850 --> 00:54:20,230
team can present designs to anyone and

00:54:18,130 --> 00:54:21,370
so instead of saying what do you think

00:54:20,230 --> 00:54:23,440
of this done okay so here's an example

00:54:21,370 --> 00:54:25,300
ready how many people love the color

00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:26,620
yellow like it's in their top two colors

00:54:25,300 --> 00:54:28,180
raise your hand if yellows one of your

00:54:26,620 --> 00:54:29,290
top colors okay so we got about eight

00:54:28,180 --> 00:54:31,030
people how did he pull it's in the

00:54:29,290 --> 00:54:32,380
bottom two colors they really don't like

00:54:31,030 --> 00:54:34,120
yellow they probably wouldn't ever wear

00:54:32,380 --> 00:54:35,710
yellow sure okay so we've got about

00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:37,780
eight people so if I show you a design

00:54:35,710 --> 00:54:39,160
that's yellow we instantly have two

00:54:37,780 --> 00:54:40,570
camps and if I say what do you think

00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:42,190
about this we got about eight people in

00:54:40,570 --> 00:54:43,630
this room that love it and eight people

00:54:42,190 --> 00:54:44,680
in the room that hate it and a bunch of

00:54:43,630 --> 00:54:46,030
other people that are just listening to

00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:47,530
them ping pong you back and forth may be

00:54:46,030 --> 00:54:48,970
shifting a little on the spectrum one

00:54:47,530 --> 00:54:51,310
way or another right now on the other

00:54:48,970 --> 00:54:53,470
hand if I say yellow is the color of

00:54:51,310 --> 00:54:54,760
school buses and taxis in the United

00:54:53,470 --> 00:54:57,070
States the reason for that is because

00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:58,840
science says it's one of the colors that

00:54:57,070 --> 00:55:00,910
catches your eye the most so we've

00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:02,290
picked the color that's not to fade it

00:55:00,910 --> 00:55:04,210
out that's going to catch everyone's eye

00:55:02,290 --> 00:55:06,400
and it really stands out here's how it

00:55:04,210 --> 00:55:08,410
compares to your competitor so when your

00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:10,120
client goes to these four websites when

00:55:08,410 --> 00:55:11,680
they get to yours yours is going to be

00:55:10,120 --> 00:55:13,570
like a slap in the face and remember the

00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:16,540
words you came up with were different

00:55:13,570 --> 00:55:18,160
bold innovative so we we decided to do

00:55:16,540 --> 00:55:21,070
it this way do you have any feedback on

00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:24,770
that now it's suddenly it's a very very

00:55:21,070 --> 00:55:27,140
different proposition we have also put

00:55:24,770 --> 00:55:29,960
together presentations for clients where

00:55:27,140 --> 00:55:31,460
after we r during the rollout we'll

00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:33,050
bring in their marketing team or their

00:55:31,460 --> 00:55:35,270
support team or their sales team and

00:55:33,050 --> 00:55:37,400
we'll actually present the methodology

00:55:35,270 --> 00:55:38,840
we went through behind the process

00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:41,360
because we can either win by having a

00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:43,040
design someone likes or we can have or

00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:57,620
we can have people agree with the

00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:59,240
methodology we'll take them offline ok

00:55:57,620 --> 00:56:03,220
sorry I thought I had took quarter after

00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:03,220
