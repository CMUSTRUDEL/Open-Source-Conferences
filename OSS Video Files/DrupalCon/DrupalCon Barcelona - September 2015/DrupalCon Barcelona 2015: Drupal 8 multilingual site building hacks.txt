Title: DrupalCon Barcelona 2015: Drupal 8 multilingual site building hacks
Publication date: 2015-09-22
Playlist: DrupalCon Barcelona - September 2015
Description: 
	Even at the time of this submission (in the beta phase of Drupal 8), there are numerous live multilingual sites built on Drupal 8. DrupalCon Amsterdam hosted a hands-on lab to check out the site building basics for Drupal 8 multilingual sites, however there are a lot of interesting things possible by combining the core Drupal 8 tools to form creative solutions.

In this session we'll forego listing capabilities and instead look at combining various Drupal 8 features into neat hacks to benefit multilingual site needs, in part based on experiences from the above mentioned live sites. We'll look at best practices for site deployment and a couple simple contributed modules too (depending on availability).

	00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:47,950
we

00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:50,500
hello hello hello welcome everyone has

00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:52,480
time to start this session so we are not

00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:55,090
moving into your valuable break time

00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:57,220
afterwards so this is a Drupal 8

00:02:55,090 --> 00:03:00,550
multilingual site building hacks I'm

00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:05,740
gabacho Chi and my co speaker is V

00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:09,970
jayachandra money there although it's

00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:12,690
the two of us speaking here and we are

00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:15,790
representing the what the team did

00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:19,930
there's a lot of people who contributed

00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:22,540
to this initiative so if you take a look

00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:25,090
at the list is pretty impressive but

00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:28,720
it's actually not the complete list this

00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:30,240
would be the complete list so it's an

00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:33,850
amazing number of people who

00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:36,400
participated in initiative we include

00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:39,760
everyone in this list who ever commented

00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:45,280
on an issue on the multilingual cube so

00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:48,280
this is over 1300 people on the most

00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:53,620
lingual initiative I think it's pretty

00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:56,080
incredible and we are not done yet so if

00:03:53,620 --> 00:04:00,220
somebody wants to get involved and not

00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:02,650
yet involved we are very happy to get

00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:04,360
you on board will be here on Friday and

00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:06,190
on the weekend so we are happy to

00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:09,250
involve you in the project we need

00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:11,890
experience of all kinds we need people

00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:13,390
testing you eyes we need people working

00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:16,780
on better you guys for things we need

00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:21,070
people writing tests for things fixes

00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:23,620
for major issues etc however we did make

00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:25,690
a lot of progress in Drupal 8 and my

00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:28,450
colleague at aqua Jeffrey McGuire

00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:30,250
summarized that very well in one of his

00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:32,370
sessions and he said multilingual in

00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:35,380
Drupal 8 is a huge business advantage

00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:37,900
will save incredible amounts of time and

00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:40,000
money and it allows us to deliver better

00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:42,550
experiences then we were ever able to

00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,520
before so basically he's saying that

00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:48,100
it's it works better and you get to

00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:49,460
results faster which is pretty

00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:52,970
incredible I think

00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:55,550
so it's been work of these many people

00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:59,660
for almost four and a half years at this

00:04:55,550 --> 00:05:02,360
point and we made a lot of changes but

00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:07,639
the high-level summary of the changes is

00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:10,039
as follows so we looked at how we handle

00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:13,160
your data and how can we know more about

00:05:10,039 --> 00:05:15,650
your data in terms of multilingual or in

00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:18,139
terms of language in general and then we

00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:21,620
looked at based on that data what can we

00:05:18,139 --> 00:05:23,750
do to help you build output with all

00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:26,389
kinds of dynamic needs that you have in

00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:28,160
your multilingual projects and then

00:05:26,389 --> 00:05:31,849
based on the output how can you put that

00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:34,550
into pages on the site so so you can

00:05:31,849 --> 00:05:37,820
make dynamic pages based on multilingual

00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:40,130
needs and we made most of the progress

00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:42,380
in terms of the data handling because

00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:44,659
that's where we focus our efforts if we

00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:47,180
did not make enough progress in terms of

00:05:44,659 --> 00:05:53,960
output building or page building that's

00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:56,259
a lot of opportunity for contributor and

00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:59,210
'old it's very core to how Drupal works

00:05:56,259 --> 00:06:03,349
so we really wanted to make sure to do

00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:05,750
that one right so for that one we added

00:06:03,349 --> 00:06:07,909
language information and translation

00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:11,150
support to practically anything in

00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:13,520
Drupal that you manage so we have

00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:15,919
language information on content we have

00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,780
language information on menus we have

00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:19,969
language information of the blocks that

00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:21,710
display the menus and we have language

00:06:19,969 --> 00:06:24,169
information on the items that are in the

00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:27,889
menus so we have language basically on

00:06:24,169 --> 00:06:30,710
every level in the system and then we've

00:06:27,889 --> 00:06:33,259
added translation support as well so you

00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:34,669
can not only translate your nodes as it

00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:36,710
was in Drupal 6 but you can also

00:06:34,669 --> 00:06:39,080
translate all kinds of other content in

00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:41,210
the system user profile fields you can

00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:43,310
translate blocks you can translate menu

00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:46,099
items you can translate all kinds of

00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:48,349
content with fields and you can also

00:06:46,099 --> 00:06:50,210
translate all kinds of configuration in

00:06:48,349 --> 00:06:52,909
Drupal 8 core we have built in user

00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:54,560
interfaces and data for that too so you

00:06:52,909 --> 00:06:56,120
can trust that your site name you can

00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:59,089
translate your blocks you can translate

00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:00,990
your views like the empty text and the

00:06:59,089 --> 00:07:04,860
and the labels and and

00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:07,400
fin views the Patriot text etc so we put

00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:10,290
translation support there as well and we

00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:13,140
made the translation support for the

00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:15,900
software interface much better too we

00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:17,430
automated the translation of that from

00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:20,310
the community so it now downloads

00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:22,200
automatically to your system and we

00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:24,510
improve the user interface there as well

00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:27,240
so I think that's the most important

00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:28,980
circle for Drupal 8 is that now we know

00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:34,080
the language of everything in your

00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:36,990
system to very granular pieces so if you

00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:39,180
have a Spanish site and you create a new

00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:40,440
content type on the site in Spanish and

00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:42,750
now you decide to make the site

00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:44,670
available in German as well then you can

00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:46,770
translate it from spanish to german and

00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:49,050
we still support all the content types

00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:51,330
that Drupal Drupal came with in English

00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:53,730
that we also translate to spanish for

00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:55,230
you so the coexistence of all of those

00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:58,770
different languages is seamlessly

00:07:55,230 --> 00:08:00,870
managed so now you have all the data in

00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:02,490
all of those languages and some of them

00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:04,290
or all of them may have translations

00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:06,530
it's kind of important to be able to

00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:09,150
build output based on that and

00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:12,470
thankfully there was a nice initiative

00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:14,700
in Drupal 8 called views in core and

00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:17,190
they were very successful in getting

00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:19,110
views in core and they were even more

00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:22,560
successful in getting a lot of things in

00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:24,840
in court to be views so a lot of

00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:27,360
building blocks in core are now powered

00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:30,330
up views the front page in core is now

00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:32,310
view the node admin page is an out of

00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:35,190
you your block administration pages in

00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:37,320
out of you it's kind of cool so now you

00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:40,050
have all that data on your configuration

00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:42,420
and content and now you have all kinds

00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:44,430
of parts of pages the main page content

00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:46,410
and all kinds of blocks generated by

00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:48,690
views now you can use all the

00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:51,840
flexibility of views to filter the data

00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:54,240
for specific languages or display the

00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:56,340
data in I in some other language that

00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,680
you want it another one that was found

00:08:56,340 --> 00:09:01,290
so we have that flexibility built in

00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:03,840
there as well and now that you have that

00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:05,280
output you can put into pages so that's

00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:07,740
where a pitch building comes in and

00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:09,110
Drupal 8 did not make a whole lot of

00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:11,430
progress in terms of page building

00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:13,460
there's no panels in there there's no

00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:16,710
fancy layering in there but

00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:20,070
blox got a lot more flexible you'll see

00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:22,290
that in our demo we now have language on

00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:23,850
blacks among other things so you can

00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:26,850
have language visibility on blacks to

00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:29,220
hide and show that that output based on

00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:31,620
your conditions so basically you can use

00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:33,900
these three things in combination in

00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:35,970
core to have data in whatever language

00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:37,500
you want to translate that data into

00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:40,380
whatever other language you want and

00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:42,330
then use vuze and other tools to pull

00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:44,490
that data out and display in whatever

00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:47,250
way you want and then you can use blocks

00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:49,350
and language visibility to push that

00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:51,750
display into the part of the page that

00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:53,670
you needed it to be so that's the

00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:56,430
functional overview of what we did in

00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:59,610
Drupal 8 core and this is all built-in

00:09:56,430 --> 00:10:02,460
in Drupal 8 core there's no contributed

00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:04,560
modules involved so how we did that is

00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:06,960
we looked at drupa 7 which is the orange

00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:09,750
circles here and we took locale module

00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:11,460
and broke it into two parts so we said

00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:13,500
okay there's a base language service

00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:15,720
layer that we need that serves

00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:18,570
everything so that's what handles

00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:20,310
assigning language to your data setting

00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:23,400
up all the languages deciding what

00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:25,350
language is used on the page and we made

00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:28,320
all of those options even more flexible

00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:31,020
so that's now a base service that in in

00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,820
its own module and the interface

00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:35,220
translation features we broke out to the

00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:38,010
interface translation module and made

00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:39,630
that richer from Drupal 7 by automating

00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:41,790
translation downloads and making the

00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:43,740
user interface much easier to use and

00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:46,680
then putting in a lot more features

00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:48,540
there too and then Drupal 6 also had

00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:51,630
content translation in court which we

00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:54,240
deleted there's no content translation

00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:56,250
module of the same type that we had in

00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:58,050
Drupal 6 that's not durable six and

00:10:56,250 --> 00:11:00,600
seven that's not available anymore

00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:02,160
instead we took the entity translation

00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:03,810
module from contribs and put that into

00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:06,030
core and named that the content

00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:09,780
translation module the reason for that

00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:12,060
is that allows us to store and manage

00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:14,400
the translations together and makes it

00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:16,950
very flexible for you to configure it

00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:18,870
however you want and then move between

00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:20,700
different configurations without needing

00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:23,130
migrations between your different models

00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:24,750
of data so that's the that was the most

00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:26,579
powerful way for us to support

00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:29,309
translations of

00:11:26,579 --> 00:11:31,350
all kinds of content on your system and

00:11:29,309 --> 00:11:33,029
then there was the configuration

00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:35,610
translation problem that we did not

00:11:33,029 --> 00:11:37,470
solve in seven and that was the i18n

00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:39,899
module which tried to provide that

00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:41,910
feature set and then it required the

00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:44,459
variable module and all kinds of other

00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:48,749
glue modules like I 18 and views and I

00:11:44,459 --> 00:11:51,269
18 and web form and I don't know what

00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:53,459
there's several other modules that you

00:11:51,269 --> 00:11:55,170
don't need anymore in Drupal 8 because

00:11:53,459 --> 00:11:57,420
we have the configuration translation

00:11:55,170 --> 00:12:00,209
solution in eight that works very

00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:02,399
closely with the configuration system in

00:12:00,209 --> 00:12:05,429
Drupal 8 it's deployable you can cure

00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:08,069
your translations etc so it's very well

00:12:05,429 --> 00:12:10,470
integrated into the deployment friendly

00:12:08,069 --> 00:12:12,149
configuration system so that's the high

00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:14,189
level overview of the modules and then

00:12:12,149 --> 00:12:15,899
the reality is that there's a lot of

00:12:14,189 --> 00:12:19,230
other modules that we took and put into

00:12:15,899 --> 00:12:21,089
core in whole or in parts so we have the

00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:23,279
admin language detection module in core

00:12:21,089 --> 00:12:25,739
we have a language fallback system for

00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:28,079
languages in interface translations so

00:12:25,739 --> 00:12:31,110
you can have specialized versions of

00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:33,149
languages we put in the title module

00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:34,860
obviously which used to be translating

00:12:33,149 --> 00:12:36,509
the title field itself is now not

00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:38,730
required because we support all the

00:12:36,509 --> 00:12:40,470
fields and then all these glue modules

00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:42,029
from my 18 and we put into court as well

00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:44,549
and then there were several other

00:12:42,029 --> 00:12:45,929
smaller changes like transliteration

00:12:44,549 --> 00:12:47,730
from machine names and all kinds of

00:12:45,929 --> 00:12:51,089
other small nice touches that you'll

00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:52,589
notice when you look around core that's

00:12:51,089 --> 00:12:54,869
I think not surprising for four and a

00:12:52,589 --> 00:12:56,639
half years of development but when it

00:12:54,869 --> 00:12:58,649
really comes powerful is when you

00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:01,290
combine these features with all the

00:12:58,649 --> 00:13:03,049
other great things that went into Drupal

00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:07,230
a core so that's where I want to ask

00:13:03,049 --> 00:13:09,290
Vijay to come over and show you a few

00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:09,290
things

00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:15,130
there you go

00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:39,700
um

00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:48,880
too right okay so so the main like

00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:52,000
Gabbar explained we have like three

00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:54,490
different set of modules in terms of

00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,530
functionality like content translation

00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:58,930
and configuration translation which

00:13:56,530 --> 00:14:01,390
works with the cmi initiative like the

00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:02,620
whole configuration system and then we

00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:07,120
have interfaces translation which is

00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:09,280
something like we had in Drupal 7 so

00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:12,640
what we are trying to show now is

00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:15,240
basically we just trying to set up a

00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:17,950
small website like a game side where

00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:20,220
we're gonna be going to display you know

00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:23,530
like a few games and we're going to show

00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:25,930
how to review it and also like how can

00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:27,670
you set up the whole side without adding

00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:29,910
any contributor module and you can

00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:33,820
translate them into different language

00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:36,280
first this side is a simple site and so

00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:37,990
the first page are the landing page we

00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:41,400
are planning to set it up like a contact

00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:44,020
us page with the contact us form and and

00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:45,340
then from there you can navigate through

00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:47,860
the menus and you can go to the

00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:51,040
different game page or a my account page

00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:54,730
from there so first I'm going to change

00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:57,940
the homepage to / contact so again the

00:14:54,730 --> 00:15:03,250
contact is a module that comes with the

00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:07,480
d8 core so this is the general it's a

00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:11,730
sorry outer-box contact us form as you

00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:14,770
know in like d7 in d8 also the homepages

00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:18,660
always say to slash node so I'm going to

00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:18,660
change that to / contact

00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:31,330
and yeah that the site might look

00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:33,130
something like this so now we are going

00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:35,770
to use this form as a contact us form

00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:43,110
instead of website feedback so I'm going

00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:43,110
to change the title to contact us

00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:07,420
so yeah so that we change the farm now

00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:09,790
the titles fine but we don't want to

00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:12,250
display this just this form we want to

00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:14,020
have a form that people can fail also

00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:16,690
week they can find us so we want to put

00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:18,940
some address and map as a main content

00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:22,690
and we put the contact task in the site

00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:25,120
so so here is where the translation of

00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:26,800
the blocks comes in so like it's a

00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,480
translation but for now it's just a

00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,430
single you know like a site with just

00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:33,430
one language just English we haven't

00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:35,260
started translating anything so we're

00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:37,450
going to swap the main content like the

00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:41,650
contact s main content as a site blog

00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:45,600
and add a new block cuts custom block

00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:49,930
with the address and map to the game

00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:52,780
store so what we're showing here is the

00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:55,570
site building flexibility of the new

00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:56,710
blocks features in Drupal 8 so let's say

00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:58,540
you want to have your contact

00:16:56,710 --> 00:17:00,550
information which obviously we'll need

00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:02,170
to be multilingual because if you want

00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:04,900
to have business you need to have more

00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:07,570
asthma as many people be able to

00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:09,340
understood what's going on I how to get

00:17:07,570 --> 00:17:12,910
to contact you and what we are doing

00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:18,820
here is to make that as the first point

00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:21,040
of information on the site and that's in

00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:22,480
the main content block on the page so we

00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:24,070
are going to move that on the site and

00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:28,960
we're going to get some nice information

00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:30,580
to people through our own text means so

00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:33,220
you want to create a new main page

00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:35,560
content so what we are showing here is

00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:37,930
block instances in Drupal 8 you can have

00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:42,610
multiple copies of your main page

00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:45,460
content and move that to the side bar so

00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:49,050
we are moving this main page content to

00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:49,050
the side bar and then creating one

00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:54,600
for this page only

00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:26,610
ooh

00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:33,360
so that allows us to use a piece of

00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:35,910
content that need that would have been a

00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:38,910
piece of node in Drupal 7 to be display

00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:41,250
in a block and then very neatly be able

00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:47,640
to move that around and translate if we

00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:50,600
want and during the same to the main

00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:50,600
page content block as well

00:18:56,300 --> 00:19:05,960
so the two things you did now is you

00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:08,030
move the do you remove the no you did

00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:15,020
not remove so you've added a new piece

00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:16,430
of block on the contact us page which as

00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:19,730
you may have seen can now be quick

00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:25,070
edited and you want it to make that

00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:30,110
foolish TMO right so so we have that

00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:32,710
contact us block we can go and make it

00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:32,710
full HTML

00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:40,149
it is but you pasted the mark up into

00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:47,440
sure

00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:54,610
so you can use this feature with this

00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:56,410
full HTML black you can use Phil double

00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:58,660
blocks etc and the neat thing about it

00:19:56,410 --> 00:20:00,730
is it has in place editing as well as

00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:02,770
any other content in Drupal 8 so you can

00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:05,380
quick edit your block as well as your

00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:08,680
content and you'll see soon that you can

00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:10,420
also translate this black then we have

00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:15,460
this form here that we wanted to move to

00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:20,680
the side bar now you can use block

00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:22,480
visibility for that which will allow us

00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:24,310
to have multiple copies of this block

00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:26,890
and show this main content in the

00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:31,000
sidebar and on other pages show it as

00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:34,450
the main page so what you can use this

00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:37,420
for is if you're building at your site

00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:39,130
and you have you have some rich type of

00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:43,060
content for locals in Catalan and

00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:44,680
Spanish you can use that to to provide

00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:47,200
them with that kind of information and

00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:48,550
you can use separate blocks for if you

00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,380
are trying to build out this site in

00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:52,570
French and German so maybe they are

00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:54,850
going to visit your site as well you can

00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:57,010
use a different kind of block insurance

00:20:54,850 --> 00:21:00,390
web those blocks based on different

00:20:57,010 --> 00:21:03,750
languages on the site so that's why

00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:06,490
block visibility can be very handy and

00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:08,410
block instances is very handy if you

00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:11,020
want to display the same thing at

00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:12,520
different places on your site so what we

00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:14,950
are showing here is we're moving the

00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:17,200
contact block which is the main page to

00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:18,940
the sidebar on this page and then other

00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:24,430
pages will keep it as the main content

00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:26,110
like this and so the rest of the pages

00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:28,690
still show the main page content we need

00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:30,280
two instances of that block and the

00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:33,040
other instance is going to shown every

00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:36,730
other page so this is a very powerful

00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:39,610
siding featuring Drupal 8 to use for for

00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:41,860
layout in your pages and mixing with

00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:43,510
language support can be used to provide

00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:46,470
separate features for different

00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:49,380
audiences if you want to go forward yeah

00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:53,580
so the next one is like we're going to

00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:56,070
add a menu item so we can display a note

00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:59,570
up because the new project yeah before

00:21:56,070 --> 00:22:03,059
that I would change this to home page so

00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:06,030
this Chloe yeah it's already home page

00:22:03,059 --> 00:22:09,120
so if I go directly to the home page

00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:11,970
yeah so it will be a home page so now

00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:14,309
we're going to add / node page as a game

00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:22,070
listing page and for that I'm going to

00:22:14,309 --> 00:22:22,070
add a menu item to the main navigation

00:22:28,339 --> 00:22:32,159
and what we are creating here in Drupal

00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:34,710
8 technically when we are creating menu

00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:36,899
items are content entities so these

00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:40,529
point to other content entities or other

00:22:36,899 --> 00:22:44,359
paths on the site and where we get them

00:22:40,529 --> 00:22:46,589
created then we'll have them have them

00:22:44,359 --> 00:22:48,179
translatable and positionable as content

00:22:46,589 --> 00:22:51,919
enemies in the menu and then we can

00:22:48,179 --> 00:22:54,239
create another one for my account and

00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:58,339
then we'll show you how to do fun things

00:22:54,239 --> 00:22:58,339
with menus and blocks and translations

00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:13,080
cool so we now have this three at a menu

00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:14,820
we have some of them that only shows for

00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:17,520
logged in users some of them shows for

00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:19,290
everyone and that's a great menu but

00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:22,560
what usually happens on a site even in

00:23:19,290 --> 00:23:24,330
the small side with game reviews is you

00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:26,910
have languages that are not hundred

00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:29,010
percent copies of other languages so you

00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:30,960
need to have some languages that share

00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:33,240
this menu and some other languages that

00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:36,690
don't so I think we would need languages

00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:38,340
first for that right so we would need to

00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:41,520
set up the languages that we want to use

00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:46,860
for the site let's do interface

00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:49,250
translation at the same time so you want

00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:53,250
to do interface translation and language

00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:55,140
so we can go faster and then we'll have

00:23:53,250 --> 00:24:00,590
languages to play around with the blocks

00:23:55,140 --> 00:24:00,590
in the menus very good

00:24:04,919 --> 00:24:14,649
okay perfect so that allows us to do a

00:24:08,770 --> 00:24:20,049
lot of fun things with us so so that's

00:24:14,649 --> 00:24:21,909
fine so so when we have when we have our

00:24:20,049 --> 00:24:24,760
languages to deal with we can translate

00:24:21,909 --> 00:24:27,190
that block to however many languages we

00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:30,789
want so let's add the languages first

00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:33,250
and then we can swap out the box for

00:24:30,789 --> 00:24:35,799
different languages as well so because

00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:38,140
Drupal 8 uses blocks for basically any

00:24:35,799 --> 00:24:40,240
part of the page we can use language

00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:42,850
visibility to hide and show those blocks

00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:45,399
so if you want to have a menu for

00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:46,929
Catalan and Spanish and you want to have

00:24:45,399 --> 00:24:49,120
a total different menu for hungarian

00:24:46,929 --> 00:24:51,390
let's say then you can do that with

00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:54,399
language visibility on your menu blocks

00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:56,500
so you can use a menu for several

00:24:54,399 --> 00:24:59,289
languages and then use another menu for

00:24:56,500 --> 00:25:00,549
other languages so we just did is we

00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:02,590
enabled language and interface

00:25:00,549 --> 00:25:05,080
translation modules and when we add a

00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:07,000
new language then it automatically

00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:09,250
downloads interface translations from

00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,830
localized drupal.org and then it's

00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:14,620
updating those translations are in our

00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:15,789
database as well so that's what's going

00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:17,940
on right now it's importing our

00:25:15,789 --> 00:25:20,380
importing our translations there's a

00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:22,720
percentage sign is not going very fast

00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:26,529
here but it's a big translation it's

00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:28,809
like 6,000 translatable strings so while

00:25:26,529 --> 00:25:33,580
that's going on we can talk about this

00:25:28,809 --> 00:25:35,110
happening automatically if you don't

00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:37,570
want to have this happen automatically

00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:39,850
on your site you can disable the

00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:43,960
automatic translation updates and then

00:25:39,850 --> 00:25:46,210
later on you can push from your staging

00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:48,490
server to the live server all the

00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:52,260
updates that happen there and do the

00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:54,850
quality assurance testing on that server

00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:57,250
so now we have one language and let's

00:25:54,850 --> 00:25:59,549
add Catalan as well and then we should

00:25:57,250 --> 00:25:59,549
be fine

00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:08,550
we have prepared sites for every step of

00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:10,290
the demo in case it goes bad so we have

00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:15,530
this side that already has those two

00:26:10,290 --> 00:26:18,530
languages yeah if it doesn't have the

00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:18,530
menu

00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:27,270
so once you once we have these two

00:26:25,530 --> 00:26:29,190
languages what we can do is to use

00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:32,430
language visibility as you can see there

00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:34,350
and say we want this menu only for let's

00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:37,140
say this one was set up to be English

00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:39,450
and Hungarian but locally probably would

00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:42,540
be a more likely primary menu for

00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:45,750
catalan and then set up an entirely

00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:48,810
different menu for four other languages

00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:51,330
that we want so what we did here is we

00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:53,400
did a main navigation that shows for

00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:55,320
English and Hungarian and we did the

00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:58,680
menu that was a main navigation for

00:26:55,320 --> 00:27:01,260
catalan and we can set up the two menus

00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:03,240
entirely differently and then swap them

00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:06,780
out in the page based on language

00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:09,150
visibility so if I quit out of the

00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:11,760
Catalan interface because some of you

00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:13,350
would not understand Catalan we can go

00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:17,040
to the block layout and see that we have

00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:18,990
two blocks we have a main main

00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:22,800
navigation block in the main navigation

00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:25,380
catalan block both of them and instead

00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:27,930
of showing them both at once what we do

00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:29,400
is for the main navigation you've just

00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:31,740
seen it's limited to Hungarian in

00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:34,800
English and from main navigation Catalan

00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:37,440
we limit to catalan so when you switch

00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:39,720
language on the site it will be for

00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:42,170
English and Hungarian this menu and for

00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:46,170
catalan will be totally different menu

00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:48,240
so you can combine menu translation and

00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:50,370
black visibility to have entirely

00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:52,470
separate menus for specific languages

00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:55,440
and or share menus between different

00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:57,630
languages and translate them and what

00:27:55,440 --> 00:28:00,170
this demo also had in there is the

00:27:57,630 --> 00:28:03,840
translation of the menu items themselves

00:28:00,170 --> 00:28:07,020
so that you can do easily on the menu

00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:09,120
interface especially if we are not stuck

00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:13,440
in Hungarian and you guys understand it

00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:19,940
in it understand better yeah

00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:22,460
so if you go to the main menu itself

00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:26,610
that's going to have all your links and

00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:28,500
what's great about that is all the links

00:28:26,610 --> 00:28:30,899
have a translate tab on them translate

00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:32,700
operation summarizes which which

00:28:30,899 --> 00:28:34,620
languages it is translated to we are not

00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:36,269
using this menu for catalan so we did

00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:38,850
not bother translating this item to

00:28:36,269 --> 00:28:41,519
catalan we did bother to translate this

00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:44,129
item to Hungarian though and when we

00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:48,929
edit it it shows that it that it is

00:28:44,129 --> 00:28:50,549
translated this way to Hungarian so

00:28:48,929 --> 00:28:54,120
that's a very powerful way to combine

00:28:50,549 --> 00:28:57,480
translations on content entities with

00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:59,340
black visibility and then you can do the

00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:05,879
same thing two blocks so there's our

00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:09,480
block with that label and you can go and

00:29:05,879 --> 00:29:12,090
edit the block and then it has a

00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:14,639
translate tab as well and of course the

00:29:12,090 --> 00:29:16,679
blocks has their own translations etc so

00:29:14,639 --> 00:29:18,629
this applies to all kinds of content in

00:29:16,679 --> 00:29:20,519
your system that you created you place

00:29:18,629 --> 00:29:23,279
on the page that you put in a menu that

00:29:20,519 --> 00:29:25,080
you put in a user profile you can go and

00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:26,700
translate to other languages you want to

00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:32,399
show how we configure the translate

00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:36,090
ability for this one so so yeah so I

00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:38,759
think I can go back to the first one so

00:29:36,090 --> 00:29:42,950
for for considering the content

00:29:38,759 --> 00:29:45,600
translation there is a set up under

00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:48,000
content length you know content language

00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:52,590
and translation you know here you can

00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:57,299
you can just define keep talking yeah

00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:59,340
define the different elements of that

00:29:57,299 --> 00:30:02,399
that you allow instead that you want to

00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:04,019
translate so for four blocks we just

00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:06,419
going to enable custom blocks and then

00:30:04,019 --> 00:30:08,340
an indie eight the blocks also kind of

00:30:06,419 --> 00:30:10,390
like nodes like it's like you can create

00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:14,140
a different type of blocks

00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:16,120
and and then yeah and under the block

00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:18,190
types you create a different set of

00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:20,580
blocks floor in a vicious world block

00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:23,110
type and then when you enable the

00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:25,200
element then it provides the option

00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:27,910
saying that if we want to enable for

00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:29,500
that element and all the fields under

00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:31,630
the element and you can decide whether

00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:34,450
you want to translate all of them are

00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:38,320
you just want to disable only particular

00:30:34,450 --> 00:30:40,570
fields so some feels it makes sense to

00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:42,430
translate some of them it's you know

00:30:40,570 --> 00:30:44,230
it's not something translatable so you

00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:47,320
can just avoid those or you can just

00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:48,910
leave it back and then at the same place

00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:50,800
you may have noticed there is a custom

00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:52,420
menu link item as well so the same place

00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:54,820
where you enable custom menu link

00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:57,510
translation and the same place where you

00:30:54,820 --> 00:31:04,420
enable user profile translation comment

00:30:57,510 --> 00:31:06,730
translation is a fun thing etc etc so if

00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:08,290
you have use case for translating any of

00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:11,740
these things then you can just go in

00:31:08,290 --> 00:31:14,530
here and and set them up and I think we

00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:21,010
are now going to move over to content

00:31:14,530 --> 00:31:24,240
types so so let's say let's say you want

00:31:21,010 --> 00:31:26,860
to have let's say you want to have

00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:30,340
actual games for review which was the

00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:32,050
point of this site so what we going to

00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:35,680
do there is we're going to create a new

00:31:32,050 --> 00:31:37,180
game content type and that's very easy

00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:40,090
it's very similar to how you do in

00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:45,220
Drupal 7 the only big change here is we

00:31:40,090 --> 00:31:47,200
have new field types now so we can do

00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:49,060
all kinds of crazy fields on games if we

00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:53,470
want we can put date fields on them we

00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:55,750
can put whatever we want so once you go

00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:58,590
to add new field there's this whole big

00:31:55,750 --> 00:32:03,820
list of things that we can deal with and

00:31:58,590 --> 00:32:07,420
that includes and that includes email

00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:09,190
boolean comments themselves our field

00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:12,160
which you'll learn soon how does that

00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:13,600
work taxonomy term reference content

00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:15,790
reference there's entity reference

00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:17,980
supporting core etc and the good thing

00:32:15,790 --> 00:32:20,920
about all of these fields is all of them

00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:22,570
can vary by language so you can create

00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:23,230
whatever field you want and then you can

00:32:22,570 --> 00:32:25,360
vary that

00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:27,730
language so let's say I want this game

00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:29,500
thing and I want to have an image field

00:32:27,730 --> 00:32:33,669
which I'm going to actually reuse an

00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:35,320
existing field for that image is fine so

00:32:33,669 --> 00:32:38,590
I'm going to have games with images on

00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:40,900
them and all the settings are okay for

00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:47,230
me I don't care about the details here

00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:50,980
and then I want to have a number field

00:32:47,230 --> 00:32:53,559
that is an integer that would have an

00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:55,240
estimated price of this game so people

00:32:53,559 --> 00:33:00,030
reviewing this game have an idea of how

00:32:55,240 --> 00:33:07,510
much it costs is one one of them is fine

00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:12,190
and we want to provide that in euros and

00:33:07,510 --> 00:33:14,140
then we want to have whatever other

00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:15,760
field you want so basically you can

00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:18,040
build out this content type with all the

00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:19,929
view all the built-in functionality and

00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:22,000
now we want to put reviews on games and

00:33:19,929 --> 00:33:25,240
reviews they should take ratings right

00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,830
because otherwise what what why it makes

00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:29,350
sense to have reviews on games so what

00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:32,980
we're going to do is we're gonna create

00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:36,400
a comment type 4 reviews which is also

00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:41,590
possible in Drupal 8 so we add a new

00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:45,040
comment type let's say this review very

00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:49,660
good we're going to target that on

00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:51,460
content in general and save that and now

00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:53,200
we have a review comment type and what

00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:55,419
we need in reviews of course is the

00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:58,450
rating so we manage fields on them and

00:33:55,419 --> 00:34:03,299
we add ratings which is going to be a

00:33:58,450 --> 00:34:05,559
list field for integers we say rating

00:34:03,299 --> 00:34:11,020
and they're going to be able to select

00:34:05,559 --> 00:34:14,320
from one to five very good limit them in

00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:17,139
one so very easy to get around with all

00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:19,629
these of all these fields for you to

00:34:17,139 --> 00:34:21,820
build off of and now we can just need to

00:34:19,629 --> 00:34:23,109
relate this comment type to that Ponte

00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:27,250
type so what we'll do is we go to

00:34:23,109 --> 00:34:30,399
content types became manage fields and

00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:33,300
we say games want to take reviews so

00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:39,790
games want to take comments

00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:41,200
there are reviews then we have a we have

00:34:39,790 --> 00:34:43,179
an option to select which type of

00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:46,090
comment it is it is a review type of

00:34:43,179 --> 00:34:49,960
comment so very easy to build this out

00:34:46,090 --> 00:34:51,400
and then all of these are content

00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:53,919
entities that are related to each other

00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:55,390
so now you can go to your configuration

00:34:53,919 --> 00:34:58,120
and say which one you want to actually

00:34:55,390 --> 00:34:59,860
translate so you go to your content

00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:02,800
language and translation and you have

00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:06,880
your comment types and you can make your

00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:09,490
reviews multilingual as in support

00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:11,650
translations or you can say you don't

00:35:09,490 --> 00:35:13,990
want to support translation on reviews

00:35:11,650 --> 00:35:15,790
but you want to you want to make them in

00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:17,860
a sensible default language so let's say

00:35:15,790 --> 00:35:20,950
when people submit reviews on things

00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:22,720
they will submit that in the page of the

00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:24,580
language right so we'll say it's the

00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:25,990
interface language selected for the page

00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:29,020
that should be the default for the

00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:30,520
review and we don't expose the language

00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:32,500
selector for the user because it would

00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:34,420
just confuse them so it's very very

00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:38,050
flexible to set up how language works

00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:39,790
for your content so we say that's

00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:42,070
defaults to the interface language and

00:35:39,790 --> 00:35:43,750
then we want to do similar for content

00:35:42,070 --> 00:35:48,310
but we want to actually translate our

00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:51,010
games so our game content type and

00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:53,830
that's where all the fields come in that

00:35:51,010 --> 00:35:55,960
are supported on notes so we have a

00:35:53,830 --> 00:35:57,820
title field we track the author by

00:35:55,960 --> 00:36:00,700
language which means who translated it

00:35:57,820 --> 00:36:02,530
we track the time of the authoring when

00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:06,370
it was changed whether it's promoted to

00:36:02,530 --> 00:36:08,470
the front page we track separate aliases

00:36:06,370 --> 00:36:11,590
for them we have separate body text and

00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:13,630
then some fields like images we have sub

00:36:11,590 --> 00:36:15,760
field level detail for them so you can

00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:18,190
say i want to share the same image file

00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:20,500
because games basically have the same

00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:22,060
photograph somebody playing the game or

00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:23,530
if it's a board game like in our case

00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:26,920
it's going to be a box of the game

00:36:23,530 --> 00:36:28,600
that's international mostly and then the

00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:30,760
alt text and the title text we want to

00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:33,940
translate and then the price is a good

00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:35,650
question if you want to keep as a

00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:38,550
unified price maybe you want to do that

00:36:35,650 --> 00:36:42,810
then you can keep you that way

00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:44,280
so and reviews we're not going to take

00:36:42,810 --> 00:36:48,150
them separate language we're going to

00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:50,520
take them in the same language as the

00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:52,950
user wanting to submit them so it's very

00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:54,510
easy to plug in all those things that

00:36:52,950 --> 00:36:56,730
you just click together on the field you

00:36:54,510 --> 00:37:00,180
I to the multilingual settings and now

00:36:56,730 --> 00:37:02,790
you have a whole input system for games

00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:05,730
and reviews and it's multilingual and we

00:37:02,790 --> 00:37:08,100
were done it within like five minutes so

00:37:05,730 --> 00:37:11,600
if we want to add new games we go to our

00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:18,090
content admin page we see a content

00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:19,560
everyone had a game I really like the

00:37:18,090 --> 00:37:22,440
hanabi game I don't know if you know

00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:23,880
it's submit that in English I could

00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:30,540
upload an image now I'm not going to do

00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:33,780
that let's say it's 20 euros so now I

00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:36,090
have this game and now I have comments

00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:39,690
on it on them which are reviews so i can

00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:45,630
say i really like this game so it's a

00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:47,970
five really like it and submit that and

00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:51,450
so the multilingual experience you run

00:37:47,970 --> 00:37:53,280
this basically is i can go and translate

00:37:51,450 --> 00:37:55,770
this game to however many languages i

00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:58,680
want here go in and translate it to

00:37:55,770 --> 00:38:01,230
Hungarian and Catalan and then on the

00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:02,780
reviews themselves we track the language

00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:04,800
that they were submitted with

00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:06,690
unfortunately Drupal core does not have

00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:08,790
a user interface to list comments by

00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:11,790
language so we are not going to be able

00:38:08,790 --> 00:38:16,380
to do that one more fun thing possible

00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:18,900
here is although we have the list of

00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:21,300
reviews saying reviews kind of a problem

00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:24,030
here is that our review submission forms

00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:26,610
still says add new comment that's not

00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:30,150
nice it's not possible to configure in

00:38:26,610 --> 00:38:32,940
core but you are at a talk titled triple

00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:36,000
eight multilingual hex so we're going to

00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:40,680
use a good feature interpolate to make

00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:42,270
that customized so what happens in

00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:45,140
Drupal 8 is you can change English

00:38:42,270 --> 00:38:47,730
interface text if you want so you go to

00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:50,580
your user interface translation and

00:38:47,730 --> 00:38:51,660
that's all the things all the source

00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:53,130
strings

00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:57,210
found on the pages and that's why you

00:38:53,130 --> 00:39:02,220
will find add new content add new

00:38:57,210 --> 00:39:04,020
comment you can filter for that and

00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:05,609
there is of course this is the Hungarian

00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:16,099
translation so I'm going to change that

00:39:05,609 --> 00:39:16,099
to to the Hungarian version of review

00:39:17,270 --> 00:39:23,880
save that so now I have it properly

00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:25,799
saying the Hungarian version but there

00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:28,470
is no option for English that's not nice

00:39:25,799 --> 00:39:32,280
however I can make it available as an

00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:34,799
option because I just go to language

00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:37,349
lists I go to English and say okay

00:39:34,799 --> 00:39:39,869
English make it available for interface

00:39:37,349 --> 00:39:41,609
translation there's a checkbox so this

00:39:39,869 --> 00:39:45,359
saves you from installing the string

00:39:41,609 --> 00:39:46,829
overrides module all built into core so

00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:48,839
now you can go back to configuration

00:39:46,829 --> 00:39:51,480
interface translation and the add new

00:39:48,839 --> 00:39:53,700
comment will wait there for you and say

00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:55,289
English by the way we totally revamped

00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:57,990
this translation interface is much

00:39:55,289 --> 00:40:03,690
easier now in 8 you can actually

00:39:57,990 --> 00:40:05,640
translate it here so English filter and

00:40:03,690 --> 00:40:12,779
now add new comment I want to change to

00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:16,250
add review save and now that I hear you

00:40:12,779 --> 00:40:18,750
are you have ad review in english and

00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:20,819
switch to hungarian was going to say

00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:25,319
that whatever i changed it to hungarian

00:40:20,819 --> 00:40:26,789
right da da so this is very useful to

00:40:25,319 --> 00:40:29,309
change whatever you want in core

00:40:26,789 --> 00:40:32,339
basically if you don't like register you

00:40:29,309 --> 00:40:33,869
want to add new you don't like add new

00:40:32,339 --> 00:40:36,690
account you want to register you don't

00:40:33,869 --> 00:40:39,210
like login you want sign in whatever you

00:40:36,690 --> 00:40:44,750
can change that it's very easy to touch

00:40:39,210 --> 00:40:44,750
up on things and fix problems sure

00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:53,200
yes so the question was how do you

00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:55,600
change this one you have six different

00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:58,540
common types unfortunately this example

00:40:55,600 --> 00:41:01,180
does not scale to that problem because

00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:04,210
this changes it globally at the example

00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:06,160
does care to log in and sign in etc you

00:41:04,210 --> 00:41:08,590
would need to have it as a field setting

00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:14,440
so the reviews label itself is a field

00:41:08,590 --> 00:41:16,270
setting so if you go to fields then then

00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:19,060
that's what I configure it as the name

00:41:16,270 --> 00:41:21,040
of the field unfortunately the add new

00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:23,050
comment is not yet a field studying

00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:25,150
however when i created this

00:41:23,050 --> 00:41:28,120
demonstration a month or so ago i create

00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:29,920
an issue for that so hopefully will be

00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:32,350
possible to change that sooner or later

00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:35,020
so reviews is coming from the field

00:41:32,350 --> 00:41:37,810
label itself and it should have a field

00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:40,300
setting that says add new review or

00:41:37,810 --> 00:41:46,960
whatever label for the form and it

00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:49,450
should use that sure so so that's so

00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:52,570
that's how you do the content types and

00:41:49,450 --> 00:41:55,660
then when you translate your nodes you

00:41:52,570 --> 00:41:57,880
will end up with multiple versions of

00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:59,560
this one so let's say I'm just going to

00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:04,000
touch up on this to make it easy for you

00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:05,560
hungarian save it and now i have two

00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:10,390
versions of this node so if you go to

00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:12,340
your note admin page now that has two

00:42:10,390 --> 00:42:15,010
versions of this one so it has two

00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:16,360
hanabi's stoli indistinguishable because

00:42:15,010 --> 00:42:18,640
the name of the game is the same

00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:20,380
regardless of the language if we want to

00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:22,590
make make it distinguishable because

00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:26,980
they are translations of the same thing

00:42:22,590 --> 00:42:30,970
what can we do we change the page

00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:33,400
because this page is a view it's a view

00:42:30,970 --> 00:42:34,990
so we go to views and we say we want to

00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:37,570
have information about the language on

00:42:34,990 --> 00:42:40,330
our content admin page so this is admin

00:42:37,570 --> 00:42:43,210
content it's a view it does not tell us

00:42:40,330 --> 00:42:45,520
the language of the content so we add a

00:42:43,210 --> 00:42:50,020
field for the language of the

00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:53,880
translation content translation language

00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:53,880
we add that field to all this place

00:42:54,380 --> 00:43:00,510
apply to all displays and now I have

00:42:58,050 --> 00:43:03,420
that language information at the end if

00:43:00,510 --> 00:43:06,180
we want to make that somewhat nicer we

00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:08,730
can rearrange this some of the

00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:11,670
operations earlier so what's great about

00:43:08,730 --> 00:43:14,640
all the views advancements in Drupal 8

00:43:11,670 --> 00:43:16,650
is most things I've used so if you look

00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:19,200
at some something in the block or look

00:43:16,650 --> 00:43:21,090
at something in the list is very likely

00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:22,500
it's going to be a view and then you can

00:43:21,090 --> 00:43:25,590
just go behind it and change whatever

00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:27,620
you want in this case I can customize

00:43:25,590 --> 00:43:34,130
the content admin view to be an

00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:36,510
admission dashboard and and have people

00:43:34,130 --> 00:43:38,100
whatever information they want and have

00:43:36,510 --> 00:43:39,960
people whatever tools they need so I

00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:42,450
have a language filter here which is

00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:44,370
built into the core view I can filter it

00:43:42,450 --> 00:43:47,580
down to only the Hungarian translations

00:43:44,370 --> 00:43:49,680
and then do whatever I want with that so

00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:52,860
that's very flexible and very very

00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:54,870
reusable knowledge to have so in views

00:43:52,860 --> 00:43:59,700
there are two tools for you to use there

00:43:54,870 --> 00:44:02,820
there's the filtering for languages and

00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:06,000
there's the rendering of language so the

00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:09,450
filter basically decides which language

00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:11,910
the query is going to filter for so

00:44:09,450 --> 00:44:13,770
that's the back end of the view and then

00:44:11,910 --> 00:44:15,450
there's a front end of the view is which

00:44:13,770 --> 00:44:17,940
language the view is going to render

00:44:15,450 --> 00:44:20,010
this and there's a lot of options there

00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:21,960
as well so you can render the result in

00:44:20,010 --> 00:44:23,430
the original language of the content

00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:25,770
that was submitted in or the site

00:44:23,430 --> 00:44:27,930
default language or a specific language

00:44:25,770 --> 00:44:31,170
or some things it's very easy to build

00:44:27,930 --> 00:44:33,660
views that are like to do lists for your

00:44:31,170 --> 00:44:35,370
translators or a translator dashboard

00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:37,530
like this one where you filter for

00:44:35,370 --> 00:44:39,480
things that are outdated in a specific

00:44:37,530 --> 00:44:41,520
language and render them in your

00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:44,750
language that you can translate to etc

00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:48,960
is very easy to combine those features

00:44:44,750 --> 00:44:54,080
so so what we looked at basically here

00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:57,120
is all that data that you can do is

00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:59,700
either in your configuration or in your

00:44:57,120 --> 00:45:01,920
content if it's in your content like all

00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:02,860
your menu items or your content types or

00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:04,780
your comment

00:45:02,860 --> 00:45:09,070
then it's feel double and it's

00:45:04,780 --> 00:45:12,760
configurable as translatable entity so

00:45:09,070 --> 00:45:14,590
you can one by one translate every field

00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:16,150
and configure which one you want to

00:45:14,590 --> 00:45:17,890
translate it so if I don't want a price

00:45:16,150 --> 00:45:19,630
I don't want the actual image to be

00:45:17,890 --> 00:45:22,780
translated they are kept across

00:45:19,630 --> 00:45:24,970
translations and then we've seen that is

00:45:22,780 --> 00:45:27,640
possible to touch up on things in the

00:45:24,970 --> 00:45:29,500
user interface and and make the

00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:32,560
interface better however we want and

00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:35,110
then build views based on the data and

00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:38,590
get whatever kind of output we want with

00:45:35,110 --> 00:45:40,270
filters and then the views could end up

00:45:38,590 --> 00:45:42,760
in blocks or the main page content block

00:45:40,270 --> 00:45:45,340
and those blocks we can move around make

00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:47,170
separate instances of them and display

00:45:45,340 --> 00:45:49,420
at different places and use language

00:45:47,170 --> 00:45:52,780
visibility to hide certain things like

00:45:49,420 --> 00:45:54,910
as we did with the multilingual menus we

00:45:52,780 --> 00:45:56,350
created the menu for two languages and

00:45:54,910 --> 00:45:58,390
created a separate menu for a third

00:45:56,350 --> 00:46:00,400
language and hidden them and shown them

00:45:58,390 --> 00:46:03,130
four separate languages so I think that

00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:05,320
really shows that this builds a reusable

00:46:03,130 --> 00:46:07,450
set of features where you can work with

00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:09,970
your data work with your display and use

00:46:07,450 --> 00:46:14,500
your displays to build your pages in a

00:46:09,970 --> 00:46:16,840
very flexible way and and only with

00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:19,450
Drupal core without any contributed

00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:22,000
modules installed in Drupal 8 today you

00:46:19,450 --> 00:46:23,410
can go and start doing this for small

00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:26,680
sites like this one I would encourage

00:46:23,410 --> 00:46:29,440
you to start now and start building it

00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:31,240
out and see see what happens and I think

00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:32,620
that's it for the session and if there

00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:35,010
are any questions we would love to

00:46:32,620 --> 00:46:35,010
answer them

00:46:42,410 --> 00:46:49,640
yes do you want to walk over to the mic

00:46:44,790 --> 00:46:49,640
then I don't need to repeat the question

00:46:51,920 --> 00:47:02,670
sorry that's a sport now the question

00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:05,490
was regarding your overriding the

00:47:02,670 --> 00:47:08,430
English string for instance review

00:47:05,490 --> 00:47:10,740
instead of add new comment hmm can you

00:47:08,430 --> 00:47:15,510
give that some kind of context in corso

00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:19,920
that this only applies to a game node so

00:47:15,510 --> 00:47:22,080
Drupal core so tuple court when it

00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:24,810
attempts to display add new comment from

00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:27,900
the form it does not tell the

00:47:24,810 --> 00:47:31,530
translation system the context it is

00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:34,080
coming from so even if in this interface

00:47:31,530 --> 00:47:36,330
in a transition interface we would be

00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:37,920
able to provide that context when it is

00:47:36,330 --> 00:47:40,440
actually attempted to be used that

00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:43,170
context is not provided so it wouldn't

00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:44,910
work unfortunately for Strings that need

00:47:43,170 --> 00:47:47,010
context the only way that's going to

00:47:44,910 --> 00:47:50,160
work is if developers at that context

00:47:47,010 --> 00:47:51,750
otherwise we cannot inject it from the

00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:53,940
outside because we don't know which

00:47:51,750 --> 00:47:56,100
component and class and plug-in and

00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:58,380
whatever it's coming from and how we

00:47:56,100 --> 00:48:01,020
would be able to like tell that plugin

00:47:58,380 --> 00:48:03,660
or something that hey view maybe want to

00:48:01,020 --> 00:48:05,970
use this context so yes ideally would be

00:48:03,660 --> 00:48:09,870
possible but technically we have not

00:48:05,970 --> 00:48:12,590
found a way yet for that right thanks

00:48:09,870 --> 00:48:12,590
sure

00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:16,760
yes

00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:29,830
so the question was do I recommend this

00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:32,790
to in general to change strings or

00:48:29,830 --> 00:48:35,770
should should you have a module for it

00:48:32,790 --> 00:48:38,200
it's so there's a lot of work that went

00:48:35,770 --> 00:48:41,050
into the translation system behind the

00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:42,940
strings actually this week there were

00:48:41,050 --> 00:48:44,650
performance improvements to make it even

00:48:42,940 --> 00:48:46,900
faster so it does not translate anything

00:48:44,650 --> 00:48:48,910
that does not need to be translated so

00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:50,800
we're placing strings in English used to

00:48:48,910 --> 00:48:52,600
be a performance burden because then

00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:55,000
then your English pages would start

00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:56,770
using the translation system it's now

00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:58,750
not that big of a performance burden

00:48:56,770 --> 00:49:02,950
anymore that's the first answer the

00:48:58,750 --> 00:49:05,830
second answer is it's very easy now to

00:49:02,950 --> 00:49:07,930
take all these customizations and use it

00:49:05,830 --> 00:49:10,630
somewhere else because all the

00:49:07,930 --> 00:49:13,600
customizations that you make our track

00:49:10,630 --> 00:49:15,970
that's customized translations so you

00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:20,500
can take these English customizations

00:49:15,970 --> 00:49:23,110
and export them to your computer that's

00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:25,210
not very big news for English because

00:49:23,110 --> 00:49:27,520
we're English you only translated the

00:49:25,210 --> 00:49:29,410
ones that you need it changed right but

00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:31,630
the same works for hungarian so if you

00:49:29,410 --> 00:49:33,970
want to take that customization that I

00:49:31,630 --> 00:49:36,430
made for the add new comment Hungarian

00:49:33,970 --> 00:49:38,560
translation what Drupal core does is it

00:49:36,430 --> 00:49:41,140
protects that customization that I made

00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:43,300
in this UI for being overwritten from

00:49:41,140 --> 00:49:45,160
the updates from the community and it

00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:46,570
also makes it available for me to export

00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:49,360
that customization and take you to other

00:49:46,570 --> 00:49:51,850
sites if I want to clone this site so

00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:53,890
it's as good as you can do with a module

00:49:51,850 --> 00:49:55,540
because built there's built-in

00:49:53,890 --> 00:49:57,940
protection for those strings that you

00:49:55,540 --> 00:49:59,530
entered in this UI if you don't want

00:49:57,940 --> 00:50:02,280
that built-in protection you can turn it

00:49:59,530 --> 00:50:05,020
off there is a setting here too to

00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:06,250
overwrite customized translations or not

00:50:05,020 --> 00:50:07,870
but the default setting is that

00:50:06,250 --> 00:50:09,820
customized translations are kept and

00:50:07,870 --> 00:50:11,440
they are not overwritten by the

00:50:09,820 --> 00:50:13,720
community updates and all kinds of

00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:16,290
imports and stuff that you do so it's as

00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:19,150
good as a as a custom module could be

00:50:16,290 --> 00:50:21,760
that has a much better UI to change

00:50:19,150 --> 00:50:24,130
things so I don't know if you notice but

00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:26,490
in seven there was no direct input for

00:50:24,130 --> 00:50:30,850
interface translation here and in eight

00:50:26,490 --> 00:50:33,170
there is and what's better is if you

00:50:30,850 --> 00:50:37,430
have something that

00:50:33,170 --> 00:50:40,170
as plurals now you can enter that in a

00:50:37,430 --> 00:50:41,820
nap Laura friendly way so it's all in

00:50:40,170 --> 00:50:44,610
place now you can just translate them

00:50:41,820 --> 00:50:46,080
you can make changes in March stems you

00:50:44,610 --> 00:50:48,120
can go have a coffee and then come back

00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:49,950
and you still see what you change then

00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:54,750
what needs to be saved I think it's

00:50:49,950 --> 00:50:57,020
really great to work on this one yes in

00:50:54,750 --> 00:50:57,020
the back

00:51:01,180 --> 00:51:08,779
the question was if this is exportable

00:51:03,890 --> 00:51:10,400
through cmi or not no so the interface

00:51:08,779 --> 00:51:16,160
translations are not kept in

00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:19,430
configuration however however as I've

00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:22,309
said there's a setting here that governs

00:51:19,430 --> 00:51:24,079
whether the updates actually happen so

00:51:22,309 --> 00:51:26,420
for some reason that setting in this

00:51:24,079 --> 00:51:28,609
site and i think is default is to never

00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:30,950
check for updates and never update your

00:51:28,609 --> 00:51:32,839
strings so this is a suggested setting

00:51:30,950 --> 00:51:35,269
for production sites if you want to

00:51:32,839 --> 00:51:37,579
quality assure your translations that it

00:51:35,269 --> 00:51:40,460
would never change your translations on

00:51:37,579 --> 00:51:41,839
the production side and on the

00:51:40,460 --> 00:51:43,819
development side you can set it to

00:51:41,839 --> 00:51:46,849
update weekly or monthly or whatever and

00:51:43,819 --> 00:51:48,650
then the other good news is then all of

00:51:46,849 --> 00:51:51,740
these translations that are updated are

00:51:48,650 --> 00:51:54,170
actually saved in the file system so you

00:51:51,740 --> 00:51:56,269
go to your configuration and file system

00:51:54,170 --> 00:52:00,019
settings and that's where you can figure

00:51:56,269 --> 00:52:03,140
where they are so this is in sites

00:52:00,019 --> 00:52:05,240
default files translations now and on

00:52:03,140 --> 00:52:07,069
the production server this is in cmi

00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:09,470
this string the setting of where the

00:52:07,069 --> 00:52:12,019
file is so on the production server you

00:52:09,470 --> 00:52:14,359
can set this directory to someplace that

00:52:12,019 --> 00:52:16,099
you manage with get and when you push

00:52:14,359 --> 00:52:20,240
your production stuff you push up the

00:52:16,099 --> 00:52:21,710
string changes and and just run a Drudge

00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:24,200
job on the production site when you

00:52:21,710 --> 00:52:25,609
launch that we import those transitions

00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:27,799
so you can do the updates on the

00:52:25,609 --> 00:52:30,259
development server staging server and on

00:52:27,799 --> 00:52:31,430
the live server just configure this

00:52:30,259 --> 00:52:34,190
directory to be a git repository

00:52:31,430 --> 00:52:36,049
somewhere and then then run in Russian

00:52:34,190 --> 00:52:37,730
port when you when you push live and

00:52:36,049 --> 00:52:38,930
then there's no updates there and

00:52:37,730 --> 00:52:41,690
there's nothing happening so you can do

00:52:38,930 --> 00:52:44,390
the QA this way the reason it's stunning

00:52:41,690 --> 00:52:46,670
cmi is a lot of data and we did not

00:52:44,390 --> 00:52:48,920
figure out how to put that to cmi the

00:52:46,670 --> 00:52:51,230
same thing as your aliases are not in

00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:54,789
CNY the same problem we haven't figured

00:52:51,230 --> 00:52:54,789
out how to put that into configuration

00:52:58,090 --> 00:53:00,810
yes

00:53:03,220 --> 00:53:09,760
hello hello hello this is very similar

00:53:06,790 --> 00:53:11,470
to entity translation when using entity

00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:13,960
translation previously we had a lot of

00:53:11,470 --> 00:53:17,190
issues with modules like workbench

00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:20,349
moderation in line entity form etc etc

00:53:17,190 --> 00:53:23,590
is there a set of recommendation to port

00:53:20,349 --> 00:53:27,670
this kind of modules to Drupal 8 to

00:53:23,590 --> 00:53:29,980
avoid those issues yes yes so there's

00:53:27,670 --> 00:53:32,230
been so this is very similar to entity

00:53:29,980 --> 00:53:35,020
translation yes because it's reported

00:53:32,230 --> 00:53:37,000
MVP translation 28 how we made it better

00:53:35,020 --> 00:53:39,430
is we made all the base fields available

00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:42,010
like title authored publishing stages

00:53:39,430 --> 00:53:45,160
without extra modules so all the fields

00:53:42,010 --> 00:53:46,869
on content are available why is it going

00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:49,210
to be better in Drupal 8 than seven if

00:53:46,869 --> 00:53:50,590
it was so bad in seven good question the

00:53:49,210 --> 00:53:52,720
reason is going to be better is because

00:53:50,590 --> 00:53:54,220
in seven it was a contributed module

00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:56,109
that people did not integrate with and

00:53:54,220 --> 00:53:57,609
there was a different core module for

00:53:56,109 --> 00:53:59,950
content translation that some people

00:53:57,609 --> 00:54:01,720
integrated with this country modules

00:53:59,950 --> 00:54:04,240
some people integrated with almost

00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:06,130
nobody integrated with both and there

00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:08,980
was no migration path between the two of

00:54:06,130 --> 00:54:11,380
them at least not both ways so this this

00:54:08,980 --> 00:54:13,270
time we only have one solution and it's

00:54:11,380 --> 00:54:14,980
in core and the reason we have this

00:54:13,270 --> 00:54:17,830
solution is because if you check all the

00:54:14,980 --> 00:54:19,750
boxes all of them then is the same as it

00:54:17,830 --> 00:54:21,339
was in Drupal 6 or 7 because then all of

00:54:19,750 --> 00:54:23,109
your fields are translatable so it's

00:54:21,339 --> 00:54:27,040
practically a different copy of the

00:54:23,109 --> 00:54:29,260
content right so you can you can on a

00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:30,910
scale reproduce a different solution or

00:54:29,260 --> 00:54:32,500
the same solution as in seven but it's

00:54:30,910 --> 00:54:34,420
always the same API is in the same

00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:36,190
infrastructure so it's one API to

00:54:34,420 --> 00:54:40,390
integrate with firkin trip and it's a

00:54:36,190 --> 00:54:42,040
core API to integrate with so that

00:54:40,390 --> 00:54:44,859
what's going to make easier to integrate

00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:48,070
the best practice is that the API was

00:54:44,859 --> 00:54:50,920
also reworked under the hood Francesco

00:54:48,070 --> 00:54:52,570
pacella is going to have a session or is

00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:53,890
having a session at this time or

00:54:52,570 --> 00:54:57,790
something like that I don't know exactly

00:54:53,890 --> 00:55:00,670
about the API behind this is much easier

00:54:57,790 --> 00:55:02,230
to use in eight because now it defaults

00:55:00,670 --> 00:55:03,730
to handling the default language of the

00:55:02,230 --> 00:55:05,470
entity and if you want to get a

00:55:03,730 --> 00:55:07,930
translation is just a method call

00:55:05,470 --> 00:55:09,700
there's no like magic areas and numbers

00:55:07,930 --> 00:55:11,980
and keys and stuff that you need to

00:55:09,700 --> 00:55:14,830
remember that was very painful in 72

00:55:11,980 --> 00:55:16,869
support in 8 it's a method call and then

00:55:14,830 --> 00:55:19,660
you can work with the translation as

00:55:16,869 --> 00:55:21,910
cologne of the original entity if it was

00:55:19,660 --> 00:55:24,400
the original entity same methods same

00:55:21,910 --> 00:55:26,710
API etc so very easy to deal with and

00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:28,539
support if your module does not care

00:55:26,710 --> 00:55:30,190
about translations at all then your

00:55:28,539 --> 00:55:31,960
module is always going to work with the

00:55:30,190 --> 00:55:33,670
default original language submission

00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:35,619
version of the entity and not do

00:55:33,670 --> 00:55:38,349
anything with translations usually

00:55:35,619 --> 00:55:39,700
that's the idea so it's not going to

00:55:38,349 --> 00:55:43,329
break anything but it's not going to

00:55:39,700 --> 00:55:44,529
work with them but but again the the

00:55:43,329 --> 00:55:46,480
reason we think it's going to be

00:55:44,529 --> 00:55:48,130
batteries it's one solution in core and

00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:50,289
it scalable to all requirements that

00:55:48,130 --> 00:55:57,519
we've seen in seven so it's going to be

00:55:50,289 --> 00:56:00,849
better and easier to integrate with in

00:55:57,519 --> 00:56:03,910
fact in an eight-core the search module

00:56:00,849 --> 00:56:06,339
and makes all the translations appear as

00:56:03,910 --> 00:56:08,799
separate results the core search module

00:56:06,339 --> 00:56:10,180
although a lot of people use the core

00:56:08,799 --> 00:56:11,769
search module however if you use

00:56:10,180 --> 00:56:14,950
whatever country module the Search API

00:56:11,769 --> 00:56:17,440
is also expose them as separate ones so

00:56:14,950 --> 00:56:20,259
we have all the information exposed to

00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:22,960
we have it in the entity access AP I've

00:56:20,259 --> 00:56:25,499
used note access etc of those are

00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:28,660
exposed in those api's as well so people

00:56:25,499 --> 00:56:30,130
interfacing with those api's will need

00:56:28,660 --> 00:56:35,570
to or should integrate with language

00:56:30,130 --> 00:56:39,600
support as well anything else

00:56:35,570 --> 00:56:42,240
if not then again Friday we're going to

00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:44,880
sprint here and there's mentors

00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:46,350
available for you to help get started if

00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:48,690
you've never sprinted you should come

00:56:46,350 --> 00:56:51,450
anyway mentor is going to help you get

00:56:48,690 --> 00:56:54,150
started work on things and if you feel

00:56:51,450 --> 00:56:56,520
comfortable then just feel free to come

00:56:54,150 --> 00:56:58,080
to our to our sprint I will be at the

00:56:56,520 --> 00:57:00,150
sprint as well as several other people

00:56:58,080 --> 00:57:02,940
from the most lingual team and we have

00:57:00,150 --> 00:57:04,980
tasks for anyone we have tasks for

00:57:02,940 --> 00:57:08,840
usability testing documentation writing

00:57:04,980 --> 00:57:11,310
demo updating whatever you want

00:57:08,840 --> 00:57:14,790
slideshow translations all kinds of

00:57:11,310 --> 00:57:17,040
things so we have we have tests for

00:57:14,790 --> 00:57:19,170
everyone and there is a sprint announced

00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:23,400
for translating Drupal late to your own

00:57:19,170 --> 00:57:25,380
language as well but you'll need to be

00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:27,120
able to find other people who are also

00:57:25,380 --> 00:57:28,620
translating to that language so that's

00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:30,990
not that easy we'll try to figure out

00:57:28,620 --> 00:57:33,480
some process for that on friday so

00:57:30,990 --> 00:57:35,160
people find each other easier but now is

00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:37,740
also the time to start looking at

00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:39,330
translating drupal 8 because there's not

00:57:37,740 --> 00:57:41,610
going to be a lot of time before it's

00:57:39,330 --> 00:57:44,760
out hopefully and you want to get your

00:57:41,610 --> 00:57:46,980
translations there sooner than later so

00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:49,320
that's it for us if you like the session

00:57:46,980 --> 00:57:51,720
or if you did not like this session

00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:54,180
please provide feedback on the

00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:56,130
conference site there's a feedback form

00:57:54,180 --> 00:57:57,720
on the session and then you can provide

00:57:56,130 --> 00:57:59,220
a feedback there please do so we can

00:57:57,720 --> 00:58:01,410
improve in the future we can make things

00:57:59,220 --> 00:58:03,770
better the conference is better will be

00:58:01,410 --> 00:58:06,210
better and everybody's going to be happy

00:58:03,770 --> 00:58:08,660
thanks for coming and see you around at

00:58:06,210 --> 00:58:08,660
the conference

00:58:42,470 --> 00:58:45,860
we'll pick them up

00:58:49,590 --> 00:58:51,920
my

00:58:51,960 --> 00:59:01,000
and all these things will be much

00:58:55,990 --> 00:59:02,410
all this Nick change will be empty

00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:04,660
that's the problem i'm hoping and the

00:59:02,410 --> 00:59:07,980
pretty avoid if it's exactly the same

00:59:04,660 --> 00:59:07,980
phrase except for

00:59:10,789 --> 00:59:17,450
anything in place to keep track of oh

00:59:12,650 --> 00:59:21,329
you do to me first and keep it here

00:59:17,450 --> 00:59:23,009
the process for that there's a lot of

00:59:21,329 --> 00:59:25,109
church and is now due to the state

00:59:23,009 --> 00:59:27,209
market changes that are critical queue

00:59:25,109 --> 00:59:31,579
and provide some type of creative tools

00:59:27,209 --> 00:59:36,930
to track which turns out to each other

00:59:31,579 --> 00:59:38,910
so their issue he can and change the

00:59:36,930 --> 00:59:42,329
date for you

00:59:38,910 --> 00:59:43,980
I ! place having a new pal well if you

00:59:42,329 --> 00:59:46,140
look at that issue there's a lot of

00:59:43,980 --> 00:59:50,940
discussion around son

00:59:46,140 --> 00:59:52,450
the script food throughout his never

00:59:50,940 --> 00:59:59,859
goes away

00:59:52,450 --> 01:00:01,810
Friday it is available figure it out and

00:59:59,859 --> 01:00:04,530
you can see the impact of the train and

01:00:01,810 --> 01:00:04,530
then you have this

01:00:09,190 --> 01:00:13,579
it'd be nice to put there was something

01:00:11,510 --> 01:00:16,690
between particular issues or which is

01:00:13,579 --> 01:00:16,690
just changing its prey

01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:21,460
keeping the same screen or the other leg

01:00:31,140 --> 01:00:33,710
so

01:00:38,350 --> 01:00:45,310
how do you another chance for some time

01:00:41,030 --> 01:00:45,310
is RC one but stick you ladies night

01:00:51,790 --> 01:00:54,790
changes

01:00:56,270 --> 01:00:59,970
they are these only packed translations

01:00:58,650 --> 01:01:03,740
which is why I'm saying that the hoop

01:00:59,970 --> 01:01:03,740
