Title: DrupalCon Barcelona 2015: Drupal 8 multilingual site building hacks
Publication date: 2015-09-22
Playlist: DrupalCon Barcelona - September 2015
Description: 
	Even at the time of this submission (in the beta phase of Drupal 8), there are numerous live multilingual sites built on Drupal 8. DrupalCon Amsterdam hosted a hands-on lab to check out the site building basics for Drupal 8 multilingual sites, however there are a lot of interesting things possible by combining the core Drupal 8 tools to form creative solutions.

In this session we'll forego listing capabilities and instead look at combining various Drupal 8 features into neat hacks to benefit multilingual site needs, in part based on experiences from the above mentioned live sites. We'll look at best practices for site deployment and a couple simple contributed modules too (depending on availability).
