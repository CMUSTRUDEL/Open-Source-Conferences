Title: DrupalCon Barcelona 2015: How to setup Nginx Varnish Full Page Caching for Drupal
Publication date: 2015-09-22
Playlist: DrupalCon Barcelona - September 2015
Description: 
	I will explain how to setup Nginx/Varnish Full Page Caching for Drupal.

In this presentation I’ll explain the principles of full page caching and how to configure your Drupal sites and servers to take advantage of the Nginx/Varnish caching capabilities. The presentation will cover the following in details:

1. Core principles of full page caching. Why full page caching is needed and what it can do for you.
2. How to configure your servers to use Nginx/Varnish full page caching capabilities.
3. How to configure your Drupal sites to “talk” to the reverse proxy servers to invalidate the cache automatically.

During the presentation I’ll also reveal some of the Nginx configuration that we use at SiteGround for our Drupal SuperCacher. The Drupal Nginx reverse proxy module that we’re using will also be briefly presented.

okay guys hello so today we'll be

00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:09,480
talking about engines and varnish for

00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:11,759
education and how to implement it for

00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:13,530
google my name is Daniel can check and I

00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:15,839
work for side round where web hosting

00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:18,570
provider and to specialize at holding

00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:20,039
Trouper websites so the first thing that

00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:21,750
I would like to say is thank you for

00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:24,539
staying up that life for myself and

00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:26,250
after that I would like to explain why

00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:29,130
you need for education in the first

00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:31,380
place first obviously your website will

00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:33,660
be faster much faster because you don't

00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:36,480
need to execute any PHP code you don't

00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:40,260
glue to get coaster database and because

00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:43,020
of something that I hate to do and it is

00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:45,539
cold read while you're Albert lunch I

00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:47,160
hate my website or one of our clients

00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:49,170
websites to go down because of my

00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,969
inspected traffic and when you have full

00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:54,000
page caching you don't have to do that

00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:56,309
because even if the back ends are down

00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,800
you're caching server can actually serve

00:00:56,309 --> 00:01:00,809
content to your visitors so what exactly

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:04,379
is for education anyone here familiar

00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:06,689
with it ok awesome so that's exactly

00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:09,840
what I expected so let's get let's say

00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:12,000
if you have a user let's say his name is

00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:15,150
bad and because i like it in water

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,920
that's my tune of all time so this guy

00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:19,020
is trying to open your website and what

00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:21,659
happens is that when he tries to open

00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:24,090
your website the server goes to apache

00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:26,400
oh there we watch over you using after

00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:29,040
that you execute PHP script and after

00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:32,430
that a mask you wear so the information

00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:34,979
goes up that chain cool goes back to

00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:37,710
server and an HTML page generated so

00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:39,600
user see that things that this thing is

00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:43,140
slow especially if you have to perform

00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:46,079
query and a 30 or 50 gigs of data in

00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:47,820
your article database so what happens

00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:50,820
when you're using a full page caching

00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:52,890
solution is that you catch that HTML and

00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:55,829
the next user that requests the same

00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:58,320
page gets the cash directly so gets the

00:01:55,829 --> 00:02:01,439
HTML page in the lungs have to do each

00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:04,590
be execution and verbs or database so

00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:06,810
whenever you deliver a cached HTML it's

00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:09,810
incredibly faster I've make sure to my

00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:12,450
sights from 2.53 sigh controlling time

00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:13,260
on their homepage to 0.2 seconds or zero

00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:18,280
point

00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:21,460
so in terms of Drupal is poop education

00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:24,310
available and the answer is both yes and

00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:27,040
no because full page caching to reverse

00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:29,490
process like edgings and bondage is not

00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:32,710
rebel in Drupal 7 it is available

00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:34,720
because you can create cash pages and

00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:37,350
save them on your hard drive but that's

00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:40,090
true the Drupal core and it's much

00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:42,100
slower to read the cached pages from the

00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:44,530
disks than it is to read them from the

00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:46,150
ramp of your server so if you save the

00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:49,000
cached pages into the realm of your

00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:52,090
server you can get them instantly and

00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,010
when you have caching servers all around

00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:55,750
every single continent that you have a

00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:58,150
user's own then you don't have the

00:02:55,750 --> 00:03:00,040
problem of latency the goals in triple

00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:02,530
seven is that as I mentioned the hoop

00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:05,710
education you get by default there first

00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:07,930
is not frankly for engines and varnish

00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:10,630
second it does not provide easy

00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:13,420
invalidation so what I mean by easing

00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:16,240
validation is that you get a page so you

00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:18,880
perform a change of that page or a menu

00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:20,650
and after that how do you invalidate the

00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:23,110
cash it is somewhere in the realm of

00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:25,930
your server and skate by engine soon or

00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:27,700
varnish the problem is that Drupal 7

00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:29,980
does not know how to talk to those

00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:33,400
referred process so it doesn't add any

00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:35,170
HTTP headers to the response that is

00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,730
provided by the server and the engine

00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:39,250
and the engine spots does not know how

00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:41,050
to handle that request the other thing

00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:43,390
is that pump education is not enabled by

00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:47,080
default in Drupal 7 so what about you

00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:50,290
wait we're all excited about it and me

00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:53,650
too mainly because it supports both

00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:55,900
varnish and engine X because it provides

00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:58,180
HTTP headers that can tell you reverse

00:03:55,900 --> 00:04:00,790
proxy hey this page can be cashed for

00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:03,190
example two hours or three hours and

00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:05,440
engines or varnish could be configured

00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:06,880
to look at the HTTP headers and after

00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:09,280
that catch the page and that's without

00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:11,890
any bloating it's easy to invalidate it

00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:14,230
as you just check the expiration date in

00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:16,510
the HTTP headers and you start an

00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:19,780
expression for the cash and it's enabled

00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:21,940
by default so as I mentioned the reverse

00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:24,460
proxy is something that could either be

00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:25,560
a different server that stands before

00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:27,660
your

00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:30,330
server or it could be a service running

00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:32,160
on your existing servers so what is a

00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:34,440
service running in your existing servers

00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,690
it's much easier to configure it because

00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:38,730
you don't have to set up like different

00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:40,850
IP addresses you don't have to care

00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:44,030
about if it's public or private

00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:48,480
networking and the latency between those

00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:50,880
so in Drupal 7 how do you handle pool

00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:53,070
page caching to reverse proxy there are

00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:56,100
three things you have to do you have to

00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:57,570
install either varnish or in jenks you

00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:59,880
have to create the configuration file

00:04:57,570 --> 00:05:02,490
for one of those and he have to install

00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:05,100
plugin or think of a similar solution

00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:07,470
that could be integrated into jable so

00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:09,060
that you can invalidate the cash so the

00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:11,880
first one is easy you just go to the

00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:13,470
ripe old bum note whichever reverse

00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:15,240
proxy you want to use and that's it but

00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:17,460
the second to their really difficult

00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:19,650
mainly because you have to integrate

00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:22,800
your reverse proxy with your Drupal

00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:24,240
installation so on our servers we have a

00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:27,870
solution which is called the super Kesha

00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:30,690
so we created the plug-in that works for

00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:32,669
Drupal 6 in Drupal 7 it provides cache

00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:35,130
invalidation and you can also define

00:05:32,669 --> 00:05:36,990
certain URLs to be blacklisted so for

00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:39,720
example you don't want a page to be

00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:42,300
catch the whole you just define that URL

00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:44,310
in the list and it will automatically be

00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:46,440
excluded the other thing that we have

00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:48,060
custom engines configuration I'll show

00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:50,550
you some of the configuration for

00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:52,740
engines right now and what we're really

00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:55,139
proud of is that this is suitable for

00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:58,860
shared hosting machines if you have like

00:05:55,139 --> 00:06:01,220
a no 100 200 customers you can do the

00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:03,419
same on your service you can put them on

00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:05,160
clustering and put in one single

00:06:03,419 --> 00:06:07,169
dedicated server it depends on the

00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:09,150
clients and after that use similar

00:06:07,169 --> 00:06:11,940
solution to provide cool packaging for

00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:13,860
all of them so as I mentioned cache

00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:16,520
copies of the pages are kept in the

00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:19,200
round and that's much faster so here is

00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:21,090
some of the configuration of the engine

00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:24,750
server that's very easy so we're using

00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:27,060
maps as you can see and we have defined

00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:31,020
certain conditions when you can page

00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:34,470
cache page or not so for example if you

00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:37,169
look at the second map which has HTTP

00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:38,810
cookie if this cookie is present and

00:06:37,169 --> 00:06:41,030
that cookie is added by the

00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:44,090
that we installed to every single Drupal

00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:47,510
installation then in that case we'll

00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:49,520
skip the caching for that request so we

00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:51,500
set the cookie in the plugin for example

00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,800
for locking users because they don't

00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:56,840
need to see a complete cash pure

00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:59,030
ecommerce cart page and this way you'll

00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:01,160
be sure that they won't see a updated

00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:04,460
content or for example the carbon

00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:06,970
another customer as you can see you in

00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:08,990
the truth mark we have defined like

00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:10,669
addresses common addresses that are

00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:12,169
present in Drupal that should not be

00:07:10,669 --> 00:07:14,960
cached as well so anything from the

00:07:12,169 --> 00:07:17,300
dashboard that contains the admin or the

00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,770
user should be screwed on the cash so

00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:21,200
pretty much that's the engines

00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:25,460
configuration but the trick is to make

00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:28,130
the plug-in or your integration to use

00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:29,990
like a cookie or a header or something

00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:32,690
like that to make sure that they work

00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:34,400
together and you provide cash pages only

00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:38,810
to the visitors that need to get cached

00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:41,150
pages so he hears some of the cold so if

00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:44,000
you look at the don't you see that the

00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:46,550
most important part is that we add a

00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,640
header which is called ex cash enabled

00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:53,630
and this plug-in is set to either true

00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:56,630
or false so if you open a page and this

00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:59,000
page has the ex cash enabled set to true

00:07:56,630 --> 00:08:00,890
this means that this page is casual so

00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,770
this could be a front page if it doesn't

00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:06,470
change for logged in users it could be a

00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:09,350
idol out an about page for whatever and

00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:11,630
give this hilary set to true the reverse

00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:13,850
proxy we will just copy the co HT my put

00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:15,500
it in RAM and after that the second user

00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:18,169
that opens the same page will get it

00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:21,950
from the cache as you can see there is

00:08:18,169 --> 00:08:24,500
also expiration for some cookies that we

00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:26,600
add to logged in users and pretty much

00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:29,000
that's the magic so right now I want to

00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:38,270
search show you some more cold out of

00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:42,880
the plugin let just drag that here and

00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:42,880
now golden it though

00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:48,750
so those are our hoops that

00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:51,360
automatically detect changes in your

00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:54,390
drupal application so if we create a new

00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:56,850
page or you update a menu link you don't

00:08:54,390 --> 00:09:00,420
have to push the cash every single time

00:08:56,850 --> 00:09:02,160
you do that this hooks will just detect

00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:04,710
that you get edited something in the

00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:07,470
dashboard and they will connect to the

00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:13,530
caching server and invalidate the cache

00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:16,260
copies of this of this page if I scroll

00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:20,010
down I can also show you how exactly the

00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:23,310
cash is cleared but pretty much it is

00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:26,310
just like a get or post query but it is

00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:27,990
called porch or ban so the engines

00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:29,640
reverse proxy ball demolished reverse

00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:32,400
proxy they also understands other

00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:35,040
commands such as ban and porch and when

00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:37,200
you say push a certain URL they just

00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:44,460
removed a certain URL from the cache and

00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:49,860
everything else remains cached let's go

00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:52,020
back to the presentation there we go so

00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:53,970
if you want to check the code for our

00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:56,610
plugin you can go to that address and

00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:58,980
download it it's available for everyone

00:09:56,610 --> 00:10:01,520
but as of now it works only on our

00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:04,380
servers because as I mentioned you can

00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:05,700
you need to have a configuration on your

00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:07,620
engines on boundaries that should be

00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:10,380
able to work together with the pudding

00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:12,150
however my opinion is that if you check

00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:13,950
the code and you are a really good

00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:15,510
programmer and I think that Drupal

00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:17,100
programmers are really good programmers

00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:19,590
because of the stuff that grows in the

00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:22,470
core I'm sure that you'll be able to

00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:24,360
understand how to pretty much match the

00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:26,160
things that I mentioned and write your

00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:27,930
own and use configuration that will be

00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:30,120
even more suitable for your own website

00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:32,640
then the default one that we had for

00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:35,280
most of our clients so what's the

00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:37,710
roadmap for us personally I'm excited to

00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:39,990
see Drupal 8 so right now we're working

00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:42,510
on support for triple 8 in our program

00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:44,640
and once it's ready it will be uploaded

00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:47,100
to the drupal of proteins modules

00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:49,560
directory and we'll be using hashtags

00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:50,300
and made the data for invalidation catch

00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:52,880
tags and made

00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:56,180
data we've used by default in Drupal 8

00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:59,390
for cash so for example you can add some

00:10:56,180 --> 00:11:00,830
meth data to a post or a category and

00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:03,260
you should know that everything that

00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:05,990
belongs that this category should not be

00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:09,260
cash or use it for example set the cash

00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:10,790
to one hour and the next thing that we

00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:13,340
want to do is implement user base

00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:16,730
caching so right now people that plug

00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:18,710
into your site they do not use the

00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:22,010
advantage of caching the problem is that

00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:24,290
right now in Drupal 7 it's not very easy

00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:26,810
to understand if you can get just

00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:28,430
certain parts of this of this page and

00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:31,880
to droop away that will be possible

00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:33,560
because of cash tax in there today so if

00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:36,800
you want to read more about how to set

00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:39,470
up varnish and engines for your websites

00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:42,050
I strongly advise you to check all those

00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:44,840
groups because Google has groups about

00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:46,910
engines and varnish there multiple other

00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:49,970
plugins in the bringing directory that

00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:52,070
you can check the code of we be able to

00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:55,460
understand how to clear and validate the

00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:56,840
cash and the last two articles I would

00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:58,760
strongly suggest you to read them

00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:01,780
because they are written by the guy who

00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:04,880
wrote most of the cash in cult enjoyed

00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:08,720
so you can also get the slides at that

00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:11,120
address because I see some of your

00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:13,250
taking pictures just download them the

00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:15,260
addresses URLs everything's in there and

00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:17,110
they're asking that I want to say is

00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:19,370
don't forget the Friday Sprint's

00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:21,650
chocolate the caching in Drupal 8

00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:24,560
wouldn't be wouldn't be possible without

00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:26,600
without all the people that contribute

00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:29,390
all the time and it was my first time

00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:32,630
going to sprint several months ago in

00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:34,280
Los Angeles during the Drupal phone so I

00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:38,600
strongly encourage you to go on friday

00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:40,130
and do your best to contribute on what

00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:43,220
every you think you're good

00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:46,010
documentation both what everything so

00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:49,520
that's for me and thank you very much if

00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:51,080
you have questions go us and now other

00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:53,510
than that we can come downstairs

00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:56,060
somewhere good it's right next to the

00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:58,520
answers head and the right side of the

00:12:56,060 --> 00:13:03,220
entrance it's a handmade booth you can't

00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:03,220
miss it yeah

00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:18,220
well I think that the question was can

00:13:16,149 --> 00:13:21,670
you just simply use the cash control

00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:23,860
HTTP headers and the engines should be

00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:25,480
able to understand when to cash and

00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:28,209
going to invalidate a page without all

00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:31,000
this custom setup right so we've talked

00:13:28,209 --> 00:13:33,990
about it and my answer is both yes or no

00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:36,730
if you have a website that you are sure

00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:38,560
you can use them with a cache control

00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:40,839
header then you can use it but on our

00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:43,420
black one we host thousands of Drupal

00:13:40,839 --> 00:13:45,070
websites so you can get a website in the

00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:47,560
cache and plug-in that is misconfigured

00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:49,930
and the cache control heather is just

00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:52,510
not set up properly or for example let's

00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:54,940
say that the cache control headers the

00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:58,029
few cents are generated on last server

00:13:54,940 --> 00:14:00,519
with a time zone configured somewhere in

00:13:58,029 --> 00:14:02,260
Europe and you're caching servers your

00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:04,660
engine's caching servers are somewhere

00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:07,300
else so what do you do in that case you

00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:19,839
have to calculate and it can become much

00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:22,240
on bus well that is possible but yeah

00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:23,620
that's possible but as I said it depends

00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:26,310
on the website when you have to come up

00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:28,839
with something to go for many websites

00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:30,370
you just have to think of caching

00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:32,560
plugins for example that you can install

00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:38,800
in Drupal they can pretty much screw the

00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:40,089
headers up okay if you don't have any

00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:44,100
other questions I would like to take

00:14:40,089 --> 00:14:44,100
