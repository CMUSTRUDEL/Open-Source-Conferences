Publication date: 2015-09-22
Playlist: DrupalCon Barcelona - September 2015
Description: 
	I will explain how to setup Nginx/Varnish Full Page Caching for Drupal.

In this presentation I’ll explain the principles of full page caching and how to configure your Drupal sites and servers to take advantage of the Nginx/Varnish caching capabilities. The presentation will cover the following in details:

1. Core principles of full page caching. Why full page caching is needed and what it can do for you.
2. How to configure your servers to use Nginx/Varnish full page caching capabilities.
3. How to configure your Drupal sites to “talk” to the reverse proxy servers to invalidate the cache automatically.

During the presentation I’ll also reveal some of the Nginx configuration that we use at SiteGround for our Drupal SuperCacher. The Drupal Nginx reverse proxy module that we’re using will also be briefly presented.
