Title: DrupalCon Barcelona 2015: Configuration Deployment Best Practices in Drupal 8
Publication date: 2015-09-22
Playlist: DrupalCon Barcelona - September 2015
Description: 
	Configuration Management is a game changer for Drupal development. Understanding how it works helps you to harmonize the moving pieces when designing a code deployment workflow for Drupal 8 sites. This session proposes a full circle workflow for pushing from multiple development environments to staging/QA and finally to production, and then integrating back changes that were made directly on Prod (a Block weight gets changed, a View gets changed, etc.).

The workflow proposes that code and config are stored together in a single git repository. The Drush config-export command is featured in order to update Git when config changes are made. Drush's config-import helps update Drupal's configuration store when a code deployment is pushed. Drush's config-merge (as part of config-extras) helps developers easily collaborate on configuration across multiple active development branches & environments.

Come to this session to learn how to implement a best practice managed workflow for your Drupal 8 projects and embrace Configuration Management in all its glory.
