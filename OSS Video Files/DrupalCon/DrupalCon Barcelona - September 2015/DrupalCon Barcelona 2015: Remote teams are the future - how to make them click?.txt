	Alternate Title - The hiring conundrum - to remote or not!

I have been working in remote teams since January 2000. At that time, there were 4 employees in the startup that I worked with - BUT the sun never set on us (We were in Australia, India, Romania and US)

Fast forward to today and again - the sun does not set on my current company!!

These 15 years have taught me some valuable lessons and those are what I will be sharing in this session. 

Some of the concerns tackled:

1. Why hire remote?

2. Who to chose for a remote team?

3. Tools

4. How to manage remote teams as a manager

5. Rules to being an excellent remote employee.

6. The Golden word - TRUST

 

About the speaker:

Educational qualifications make Suchi a "Manager" in Finance and Marketing, but her 18+ years of experience has mostly been in the world of IT. She started off with PHP in the year 2000 when OOPS was something people said when they made a mistake and not necessarily in "computer" terms. She has a passion for development, and just can not keep her hands off of the code - even when needed. For the past 5 years, she has been handling projects in managerial capacity as well.
