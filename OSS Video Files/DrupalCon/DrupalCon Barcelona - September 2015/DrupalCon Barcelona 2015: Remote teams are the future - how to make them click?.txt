Description: 
	Alternate Title - The hiring conundrum - to remote or not!

I have been working in remote teams since January 2000. At that time, there were 4 employees in the startup that I worked with - BUT the sun never set on us (We were in Australia, India, Romania and US)

Fast forward to today and again - the sun does not set on my current company!!

These 15 years have taught me some valuable lessons and those are what I will be sharing in this session. 

Some of the concerns tackled:

1. Why hire remote?

2. Who to chose for a remote team?

3. Tools

4. How to manage remote teams as a manager

5. Rules to being an excellent remote employee.

6. The Golden word - TRUST

 

About the speaker:

Educational qualifications make Suchi a "Manager" in Finance and Marketing, but her 18+ years of experience has mostly been in the world of IT. She started off with PHP in the year 2000 when OOPS was something people said when they made a mistake and not necessarily in "computer" terms. She has a passion for development, and just can not keep her hands off of the code - even when needed. For the past 5 years, she has been handling projects in managerial capacity as well.

hi everybody do you think we should

00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:08,970
start or maybe wait for five more

00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:12,179
minutes all right let's just start with

00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:14,820
interactions maybe hi my name is to

00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:19,560
trigger I'm working as a technical team

00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:22,830
leader kakaako at this moment and the

00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:25,710
reason why I I decided to present on

00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:28,019
this particular topic was that this is

00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:31,140
really close to my heart I have been

00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:35,700
working remotely on and off since I

00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:37,530
think 2004 and that is why whatever i'm

00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:39,719
going to present today is not a

00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:44,940
theoretical thing it's more of my

00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:47,340
experiences one thing i would like you

00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:49,530
or I would like from you input if this

00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:53,100
particular session is that let's make

00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:55,079
this more of a not not a one-way session

00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:56,730
let's make it more of a discussion so

00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:58,260
anywhere you feel that you have any

00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:00,750
questions any way you feel you would

00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:03,949
need to interject please do and that

00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:03,949
would be really helpful for me as well

00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:09,479
just to get a feel of the audience how

00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:17,700
many of you are actually working

00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:20,700
remotely as of now alright that's that's

00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:26,070
a real good number of people here who

00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:28,250
are actually working remotely so women

00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:28,250
at

00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:38,410
so I mean when we say working remotely

00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:41,200
what is working remotely or italic

00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:44,440
emitting actually mean in layman terms

00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:46,780
if we say but it can be working from

00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:49,270
home working from a coffee shop working

00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:52,780
from the library basically working from

00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:54,850
anywhere else anywhere other than a

00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:56,590
structured office that you have that is

00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:59,590
what working remotely essentially means

00:01:56,590 --> 00:02:04,720
but if you are looking for an official

00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:06,910
definition so technical meeting is a

00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:09,280
work arrangement in which the employee

00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:12,280
works outside the office often working

00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:14,980
from home or at location close to home

00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:18,090
it can be coffee shops it can be

00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:18,090
libraries and other locations

00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:28,180
essentially there are no defined types

00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:30,370
of work problems but the the types of

00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:33,040
types of remote working that I have

00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:36,310
listed down here are the ones that I

00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:41,709
have experienced during my last let's

00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:44,140
say 11 years of of my experience so this

00:02:41,709 --> 00:02:47,200
is the first one probably so all the

00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:49,420
teammates are scattered they are they

00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,709
are working anywhere I mean anywhere

00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:54,580
across the globe across different

00:02:50,709 --> 00:02:57,300
locations to give you an example my

00:02:54,580 --> 00:03:01,300
first telecom a job was a start-up and

00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:02,530
we were four people in there and the

00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:04,720
locations were we were literally

00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:07,750
following the Sun so we had one in

00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:09,670
Australia I am from India then we had

00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:11,890
one in Romania and one in the u.s. so

00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:14,230
essentially we used to joke about the

00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:16,720
fact that the Sun never sets sets on our

00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:18,580
company because the Sun is like

00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,950
literally going to and we had to

00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:22,930
literally pay tactic but it was just for

00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:25,209
people in different different locations

00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:30,580
different time zones and that is one

00:03:25,209 --> 00:03:33,700
type of telecom meet the other type of

00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:38,140
telecom eaters like all the team members

00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:41,560
are in the same geographic area same

00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:44,019
time zones etc but they don't really sit

00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:44,319
together one of the examples was Alaska

00:03:44,019 --> 00:03:46,719
mean

00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:49,239
I was working for so they have they have

00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:52,150
a real remote working culture so we have

00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:55,239
people from right from the top of enya

00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:57,040
that is Srinagar Kashmir too and if you

00:03:55,239 --> 00:03:59,200
don't go down we have people from daily

00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,329
from mandeville from Jaipur and right on

00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:04,299
the bottom we have people from Bangalore

00:04:01,329 --> 00:04:06,310
so the one of the advantages will that

00:04:04,299 --> 00:04:09,280
this kind of working has over the one

00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:13,000
above is there is no time soon gap so

00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:15,639
that really helps out a bit and then

00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,630
another type of thing that we I have

00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:21,340
essentially experiences that the team is

00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:24,190
divided into smaller jeans and those

00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:26,949
smaller teams go work together they are

00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:29,470
on locations but essentially these jeans

00:04:26,949 --> 00:04:32,740
are remotely working so for example at

00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:36,099
aquia we have a 25-member team in Delhi

00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:38,199
and then we have a team in in the US

00:04:36,099 --> 00:04:41,139
which are working together we have our

00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:43,780
clients in let's say the York Region or

00:04:41,139 --> 00:04:52,180
the u.s. region and that's how things

00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:54,130
work but the the reason that we are

00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:57,639
sitting here to you you guys are sitting

00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:59,949
there is why we want why remote working

00:04:57,639 --> 00:05:02,409
is an essential thing today and how we

00:04:59,949 --> 00:05:05,020
want to make sure that it is a

00:05:02,409 --> 00:05:06,789
successful remote working for its

00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:08,560
successful both from the employee point

00:05:06,789 --> 00:05:10,810
of view and from the employers point of

00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,880
view so before we go there I'll just

00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:18,009
list down some benefits of remote

00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:19,830
working essentially I mean if I seen in

00:05:18,009 --> 00:05:22,780
a nutshell it's a win-win situation for

00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:25,030
for everybody how's it a win-win

00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:27,580
situation for everybody i would like you

00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:28,990
guys to give me some examples or give me

00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:31,199
I mean there are so many people who are

00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:34,570
actually working remotely here so

00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:39,570
anybody you were saying that you are a

00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:39,570
remote worker how does it that yes

00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:56,740
right so sorry what's your name

00:05:53,789 --> 00:05:58,810
Francesca alright so as for fringe esta

00:05:56,740 --> 00:06:00,460
it's it allows you to be flexible with

00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:05,020
the time and allows you more time with

00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:11,080
your family right anybody else any any

00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:16,180
other thoughts around that yeah totally

00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:19,930
agree I live in a city in India it's a

00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:22,659
capital of India new delhi and I mean

00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:24,970
essentially if I am looking at a at a

00:06:22,659 --> 00:06:26,710
workplace it's essentially a three hour

00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:33,280
commute three to four hours commute

00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:35,620
easily so it saves me on that yes so

00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:37,630
just listing down those things and i'm

00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:39,580
sure most of you will agree the moment

00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:43,199
you think that no this doesn't work for

00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:47,320
me i would like you to just jump on it

00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:51,009
better work family balance for employees

00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:53,469
working from home essentially offers a

00:06:51,009 --> 00:06:55,719
better work family balance some people

00:06:53,469 --> 00:06:57,580
might not agree with that because being

00:06:55,719 --> 00:06:59,949
too close with your spouse is also not a

00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:02,020
very good thing i mean living together

00:06:59,949 --> 00:07:03,820
for 24 hours and being together being

00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:06,630
sitting together with each other for 24

00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:09,250
oz is not a very good thing but I really

00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:12,849
strongly believe that remote working

00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:16,360
allows us to have a better work family

00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:18,490
behavior to give you an example i'll

00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:22,870
give you my own example and as I said

00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:26,669
this is this whole presentation is all

00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:31,479
about my practical experiences so I

00:07:26,669 --> 00:07:34,360
started working remotely in 2011 2014

00:07:31,479 --> 00:07:37,330
sorry and I was less than 30 years of

00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:40,599
age but my commute on was more than

00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:43,360
three hours per day I had a young child

00:07:40,599 --> 00:07:44,889
she is she was six at that time she

00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,020
needed me around but I was just too

00:07:44,889 --> 00:07:48,849
tired just too tired to enjoy my life

00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:51,669
just to try to sit with my cage just

00:07:48,849 --> 00:07:55,200
retire to cater to my family and then I

00:07:51,669 --> 00:07:58,380
mean I got an opportunity to telecommute

00:07:55,200 --> 00:08:02,490
and you frankly speaking it was a big

00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:05,160
big risk in India in 2014 nobody knew

00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:07,500
what I Rico meters nobody expected that

00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:10,920
a person can actually work from whom do

00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:12,450
some legal work and earn money and it

00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:15,270
was a big risk for me as well because I

00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:17,820
had not met the person who was offering

00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:20,100
me employment there was no Indian entity

00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:21,870
that they have so I was worried okay if

00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:24,840
what if I work for one month and they

00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:27,420
don't pay me but that was a risk i just

00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:30,570
took and i'm happy that i took that risk

00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:33,090
and thankfully it paid off but work

00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:37,290
family balance is one of the biggest

00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:40,919
reasons why telecommute is becoming the

00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:44,100
n thing nowadays another thing is of

00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:49,440
course flexible timings so i might want

00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:52,050
to sorry so i might want to like start

00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,940
my day at eight o'clock somebody else

00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:56,580
wants to start his or her day at ten

00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:59,280
o'clock telecom meeting is something

00:08:56,580 --> 00:09:01,080
that allows you that at times nowadays

00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:05,250
thankfully most of the offices don't

00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:07,950
really force on a strict office timings

00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:10,770
but still we do have is especially in

00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:12,660
India we have a lot of offices which

00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:16,140
have a punch in and punch out calendar

00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:18,090
punch out holes culture so you have to

00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:19,800
be there at nine o'clock if you're not

00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:22,350
there by nine o'clock you reach there by

00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:24,840
nine thirty for example you have day

00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:26,730
vacation I mean they take it off from as

00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:29,490
a half day for you and that kind of

00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:33,150
cultural still exists exists in many

00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:39,630
companies but telecom it allows you to

00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:42,350
get out of that financials we did say

00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:45,240
that yes we save a lot of time in

00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:48,420
traveling but we do save a lot of money

00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:50,760
as well traveling to and from office is

00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:54,270
not expense and not easy not and it

00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:57,810
doesn't come for free so we have maybe

00:09:54,270 --> 00:10:02,150
the petrol diesel or whatever gas costs

00:09:57,810 --> 00:10:04,650
we have maybe train costs whatever and

00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:06,360
let's not talk about just the cost of

00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:07,490
traveling there are there are incident

00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:10,520
to other instances

00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:13,430
if I'm I mean if I'm going to the office

00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:14,890
I have to I mean make sure that I i I'm

00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:17,839
wearing a proper dress I am wearing

00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:20,480
proper makeup maybe so those costs all

00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:23,720
goals also count I mean sitting on

00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:25,640
anyways pajamas is always less expensive

00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:28,370
than a pair of proper pants and suits

00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:29,870
and you know and in fact pajamas also

00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:34,010
not required when you're she tell you

00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:35,779
committing so that's one of the major

00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:38,000
plus points when it comes to remote

00:10:35,779 --> 00:10:41,300
working that yes people save a lot

00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,790
that's a fact there was a time when I

00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:45,830
will steady commenting for 34 years on a

00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:48,320
stretch and frankly speaking I did

00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:50,810
notice that I was not buying a lot of

00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:52,760
clothes because when I'm sitting at home

00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:54,140
I don't really need a lot of clothes but

00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:57,290
when I have to go to the office every

00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:59,450
day that is a saving whether I mean you

00:10:57,290 --> 00:11:04,370
might not think of it as a saving but it

00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:07,370
actually matters and the biggest biggest

00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:10,160
biggest reason for me today for every

00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:12,529
one of us I think time is the biggest

00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:16,190
cost for everybody of us and if we are

00:11:12,529 --> 00:11:19,339
saving on time yes we are saving saving

00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:22,640
a lot and that is so for employees d0

00:11:19,339 --> 00:11:25,130
for major things that come to my mind if

00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,690
there is something else that any of the

00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:28,910
telecom eaters hear any of the remote

00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:30,860
working people here feel that yes that

00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:39,230
should be added to list please do tell

00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:47,180
me and you know yeah sorry I didn't get

00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:50,260
it huh silence peace of mind silence yes

00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:53,390
and that is I would say that's the

00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:56,120
two-way thing some people want that some

00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:59,540
people don't want that but yes so people

00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:01,250
who work better when there is calm

00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:03,680
around them in their silence around them

00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:07,220
yes it really works because at times

00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:09,320
offices are so clattered and so choppy

00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:12,560
that you don't really get a lot of

00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:15,800
productivity out of it coming on to

00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:19,300
productivity why is it why is telecom

00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:19,300
eating a good option for employers

00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:30,200
how many of you agree to this thank you

00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:32,900
why don't you agree the people who

00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:34,700
haven't really put their answer I really

00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:39,050
want you have why don't you agree

00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:40,850
because if if an employee has a better

00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:42,980
work-life balance he's saving in

00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:46,460
financials if he's saving in time he's

00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:48,350
happy naturally happy employees a

00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:49,970
productive employee and for employers I

00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:57,560
think that is the biggest biggest

00:12:49,970 --> 00:13:00,980
biggest plus like you just said silence

00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:04,010
increasing productivity I mean in an

00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:06,400
independent study it was seen that fifty

00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:09,560
three percent of remote workers actually

00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:11,090
worked overtime as compared to only

00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:14,390
twenty eight percent of non remote

00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:17,000
workers and that I mean this is one just

00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:19,790
one of the stats which shows that remote

00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:26,480
work King does increase the productivity

00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:31,430
a lot I don't know how many of you have

00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:33,650
actually seen this but if I am in let's

00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:38,720
say I'm in india i am in delhi and if i

00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:40,700
limit myself my company only to the if i

00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,590
limit myself saying that okay i am going

00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:44,720
to hire only people who will come to the

00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:47,060
office so essentially i am limiting

00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:49,430
myself to people who are available in

00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:51,500
the daily area or maybe were people of

00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:55,250
the people who are willing to relocate

00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:59,480
right so essentially i am i am limiting

00:13:55,250 --> 00:14:02,390
my talent pool but the moment I open up

00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:06,050
to them to an option of remote working

00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:09,140
my talent pool explodes like anything I

00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:11,840
will give you my example I have been

00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:16,400
working in Drupal for the past more than

00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:19,700
nine years now but I cannot move I just

00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:21,500
cannot move so the company that wants to

00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:24,080
hire me either has to be in the deli

00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:26,330
area or they have to have offer me if

00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:28,610
they really want me so all they have to

00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:30,140
offer me a remote working option

00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:32,120
otherwise I will not be able to join

00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:34,339
them so this is a very

00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:37,880
simple thing there are so many companies

00:14:34,339 --> 00:14:39,830
now that offer remote working so

00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:43,610
essentially i mean i'll give an example

00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:45,800
of one of my earlier companies so we

00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:47,360
have i was working in delhi we have

00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:49,820
earlier hair she was working from

00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:51,500
Srinagar we have we have a person

00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:54,260
working from Australia we have a person

00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:57,710
working from Syria and another one

00:14:54,260 --> 00:15:00,560
working from Japan because we found the

00:14:57,710 --> 00:15:02,240
right people the right mix and we didn't

00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:08,390
have to limit ourselves geographically

00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:13,910
this is a big plus for employers and of

00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:17,660
course financials are aquia office in

00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:20,150
Boston down down or I mean think of any

00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:22,580
any location any prime office location

00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:25,850
it doesn't come cheap it doesn't come

00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:28,850
cheap at all and so having not having a

00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:31,370
physical office just having a virtual

00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:33,940
office does help a lot in the financials

00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:36,230
in the in the financials of the company

00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:38,230
there is no need to invest in office

00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:40,339
space there is no need to invest in

00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:42,470
furniture there's no anybody need to

00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:44,839
invest in infrastructure like let's say

00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:47,750
the internet connection phone

00:15:44,839 --> 00:15:57,430
connections etc etc etc and that does

00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:57,430
save a lot so ah yeah sure

00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:11,440
agree so so what you are it sorry

00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:24,500
sorry I didn't get your life laughing

00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:24,500
from the employer point of view

00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:43,850
yeah so when yes I do understand that

00:16:43,019 --> 00:16:45,870
there's a difference between

00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:47,730
self-employed and remotely working

00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:50,399
people and people who are working

00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:52,170
remotely for a company but then again

00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:55,980
what you are essentially saying is that

00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:58,140
working remotely is also a an art that

00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:59,610
not everybody has it doesn't mean it's

00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:01,170
it's a culture that needs to be

00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:02,970
developed and it's it's something that

00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:05,010
and that is what we will be coming to

00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:07,290
and later in the in the presentation

00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:09,449
because everybody is not suited for

00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:10,829
remote working and there is none there

00:17:09,449 --> 00:17:12,929
are some things that you need to do to

00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:15,150
be successful as a remote worker as well

00:17:12,929 --> 00:17:22,800
as a remote employer and that's what we

00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:26,059
will be touching base on so I mean it's

00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:30,990
every job suited for remote working

00:17:26,059 --> 00:17:35,340
sorry no answers is every job suited for

00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:37,350
remote working some very simple examples

00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:43,830
of jobs not suited for removal remote

00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:48,110
working a cab driver any other I clean

00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:51,419
oh yes I would not agree with that I

00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:56,550
would not agree with that a teacher can

00:17:51,419 --> 00:18:02,040
be removed sorry um things are changing

00:17:56,550 --> 00:18:05,190
their I have seen people doing remote

00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:09,600
surgeries but yes I do agree with you so

00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:11,400
not every job is suited for and I don't

00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:14,880
think I need to really expand on this

00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:16,290
there are certain jobs but I think for

00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,929
most of the people who are working here

00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:20,640
we are drupal as we are working with

00:18:18,929 --> 00:18:24,679
technology and for most of us I think

00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:24,679
remote working is an option I would say

00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:31,650
so coming back to the point that you

00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:34,740
raised sorry I don't remember I don't

00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:37,470
know your name coming back to the point

00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:40,080
that you raised so who is suited for

00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:42,510
remote working this is where we will be

00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:45,960
talking a bit about from the hiring

00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:49,080
perspective that if as an employer or as

00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:51,480
a person will just started or startup I

00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:52,830
am looking for people and what kind of

00:18:51,480 --> 00:19:02,100
people I should be looking

00:18:52,830 --> 00:19:07,950
when I am looking for remote people make

00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:10,710
sense working in an office is a lot

00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:13,340
about working but it's more it's a lot

00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:16,860
about having a social workplace as well

00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:20,580
watercooler talks going let's go for a

00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:23,460
coffee I mean general chit chats so I

00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:27,870
remote worker a person who will fit this

00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:30,600
role is a person who is okay without a

00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:52,580
social work place I think that is one of

00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:57,899
the one of the key criteria yep exactly

00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:59,760
yes yeah so I should probably refrain

00:19:57,899 --> 00:20:03,990
sit a bit saying without a physical

00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:07,260
social work place so yes a virtual

00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:11,159
social work place is a must if we have

00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:13,470
to have let's say a good remote

00:20:11,159 --> 00:20:16,019
environment in the company in the in the

00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:18,240
very way we are working a remote social

00:20:16,019 --> 00:20:20,100
work place is a must but what

00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:25,130
essentially I'm saying about here is a

00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:25,130
physical social work place

00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:37,200
hiya doers see propensity towards action

00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:40,500
is really really important this this is

00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:42,600
a type of person that I mean if he

00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:45,960
doesn't have a task list he'll find

00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:48,690
something to do and I'm sorry I'm saying

00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:51,540
he i should say they to be more

00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:53,460
diplomatic here myself should not be

00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:56,429
paying that okay so this is the type of

00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:58,200
person they will find something to do

00:20:56,429 --> 00:21:00,090
they don't have to have a task list they

00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:01,500
don't have to have somebody standing

00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:03,870
above their shoulder than you're not

00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:06,270
keeping a tap on what they are doing and

00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:08,820
what are you done with this okay here's

00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:10,650
the next task to do his own estas you

00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:11,760
don't know they'll find something to do

00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:13,980
if they don't have something to do

00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:16,740
they'll go to the managers they'll go to

00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:26,010
their appears and figure out something

00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:28,770
to do people who are able to prioritize

00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:31,320
at times and especially talking about

00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:36,059
teams where time zones is a big concern

00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:38,370
I have two three tasks in my hand and I

00:21:36,059 --> 00:21:42,660
don't have anybody whom I can talk to

00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:44,580
about prioritization but I know about

00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:46,290
the whole project let's say in a project

00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:48,210
environment I know about the project so

00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:50,250
I should be able to prioritize or I

00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:52,169
should make sure that the day before I

00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:53,820
have already talked to people who know

00:21:52,169 --> 00:22:02,730
what to prioritize how to prioritize

00:21:53,820 --> 00:22:05,490
it's very important this is I think a

00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:08,010
really really important trait to have we

00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:09,780
need people remote people who are

00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:11,580
successful are essentially people who

00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:13,890
can write well and the reason is that

00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:16,410
most of the remote communication doesn't

00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:19,320
happen you just go don't go to a

00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:21,630
person's you know cubicle or a person's

00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:24,030
office and say hi I have this issue

00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:27,210
let's talk about it no you either send

00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:29,900
out an email and I am or something like

00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:32,040
that so unless and until you can write

00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:33,870
properly unless until you are actually

00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:37,409
able to explain yourself in a nice

00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:40,740
manner and you know it becomes very

00:22:37,409 --> 00:22:40,920
difficult to be able to communicate to

00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:45,210
be

00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:47,430
able to put your thoughts across if

00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:49,950
someone struggles to write clearly and

00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:51,420
concisely they'll naturally struggle in

00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:55,050
a remote team and that's what my

00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:58,080
experience has been one of one of very

00:22:55,050 --> 00:23:02,940
important aspects of this of writing is

00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:05,880
that often an email are an I am or our

00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:10,130
message can also sound very Curt and

00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:12,330
very you know rude so we have to be

00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:16,170
cognizant of that fact and we have to

00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:18,270
make sure that we write accordingly make

00:23:16,170 --> 00:23:21,630
use of a lot of smileys maybe more

00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:25,500
emoticons etc but it's really important

00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:27,240
because in verbal communication what we

00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:29,010
are saying is important but the tone is

00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:30,720
also really important and that is what

00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:33,030
we lose in written communication and

00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:38,180
that's what we have to really cater to

00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:38,180
when we are focusing on on a remote team

00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:47,790
and I think one of the most most most

00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:50,700
important aspects of remote working is

00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:54,000
you need to hire somebody who is

00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:56,820
trustworthy from whatever my experience

00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:59,070
has been Trust is a golden word when it

00:23:56,820 --> 00:24:02,100
comes to remote working unless I until

00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:04,590
and it's not just a one-way street you

00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:06,510
the employer needs to him to trust the

00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:09,090
employee as well as the employee needs

00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:12,510
to trust the employer and so when you

00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:15,270
are hiring when you're let's say take it

00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:17,400
no interview for example there is a

00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:19,710
sixth sense which does tell you that ok

00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:21,990
this person is not trustworthy do listen

00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:23,880
to that sixth sense that has really

00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:30,660
helped me a lot when I have been hiring

00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:32,760
in the past and last but not least I

00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:35,070
think this is something which is sort of

00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:40,170
related to the first point because of

00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:42,810
the absence of a physical social work

00:24:40,170 --> 00:24:44,520
place and physical social infrastructure

00:24:42,810 --> 00:24:47,910
I think it's important that they have a

00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:49,740
local local support system it can be it

00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:51,930
can be a technical support system it can

00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:54,750
be their family support etc etc so that

00:24:51,930 --> 00:24:59,430
the person doesn't feel lonely I have

00:24:54,750 --> 00:25:01,170
people who who lose their who literally

00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:03,000
lose their sanity I mean because of the

00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:04,650
fact that they don't have in a proper

00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,300
interaction with people they don't have

00:25:04,650 --> 00:25:08,640
people around so if they don't have

00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:12,440
people around it becomes at times I have

00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:15,150
seen it become a become a concern

00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:29,810
anything you guys might want to add

00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:29,810
please yeah I don't deny that yes but

00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:36,000
yes I mean yes it's important to have a

00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:38,340
trustworthy person when you are in a

00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:42,270
physical thing that kind of environment

00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:43,920
as well but you know in a physical

00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:45,990
environment you still have that option

00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:48,000
to be able to keep a constant check of

00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:49,560
that person just staying with him

00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:53,880
sitting with him being on top of him

00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:56,340
always but but in a remote environment

00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:59,400
that's just not possible so it becomes i

00:25:56,340 --> 00:26:02,880
would say having a trustworthy person is

00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:04,950
in a physical actual office is important

00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:06,390
but it's even more important when it

00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:08,430
comes to building our remote teams

00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:10,530
that's the point I'm trying to put here

00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:13,400
I'm not saying that trustworthy is not

00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:13,400
needed yeah

00:26:30,219 --> 00:26:33,219
and

00:26:35,879 --> 00:26:43,069
I agree I agree and I frankly speaking I

00:26:40,049 --> 00:26:43,069
don't have an answer too bad

00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:59,640
yeah does that answer a bit yeah I mean

00:27:56,790 --> 00:28:01,470
I don't totally agree that just is not

00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:03,840
something you can talk you cannot trust

00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:06,390
a person with just like say to interview

00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:08,100
for two meetings yes it builds up over

00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:18,230
time but this is one of the traits that

00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:27,809
we should be looking out for I'm sorry I

00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:29,900
don't know what I did okay sorry for

00:28:27,809 --> 00:28:29,900
that

00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:45,270
so coming back to our main thing here

00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:49,080
how to make it work and my answer to

00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:50,550
that is number one communication number

00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:52,470
two communication number three

00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:55,260
communication number for communication

00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:58,860
and number five communication because I

00:28:55,260 --> 00:29:00,770
think that is the one most the five most

00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:02,430
important things that we need to have

00:29:00,770 --> 00:29:10,020
communicate communicate communicate

00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:12,980
communicate regular communication no I'm

00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:15,570
just trying to be nitpicking here so

00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:19,380
regular communication make sure that

00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:21,600
your teams have a regular meet up a

00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:24,690
regular letter stand-up meeting every

00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:27,360
day you know so you do meet regularly

00:29:24,690 --> 00:29:29,730
and you do communicate with each other

00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:31,740
on a regular basis it doesn't depend

00:29:29,730 --> 00:29:36,890
what you talked about but it's very

00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:39,990
important having official time are

00:29:36,890 --> 00:29:42,650
scheduled I mean it is really important

00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:47,760
on you know in a remote team

00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:51,030
communication proactive communication so

00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:54,030
I am a remote worker and I just saw a

00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:57,330
piece of code again I am a developer so

00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:59,340
I talk in terms of code so I see a piece

00:29:57,330 --> 00:30:00,960
of code written by somebody else written

00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:04,050
by somebody else let's say one year down

00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:05,970
the line but I feel that this piece of

00:30:04,050 --> 00:30:08,760
code is going to come back and bite us

00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:11,550
in the future right this is just an

00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:14,070
example i am giving it it is my

00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:16,890
responsibility to go ahead and bring

00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:19,260
that up in the team bring that up to my

00:30:16,890 --> 00:30:21,030
manager to the team as a whole to the

00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:23,370
person maybe who wrote this code or

00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:25,950
whatever even though it's not a problem

00:30:23,370 --> 00:30:28,170
as of now so proactive communication is

00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:29,940
really really important this might be a

00:30:28,170 --> 00:30:35,850
problem later so let's talk about it a

00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:37,320
bit now of course reactive reactive so I

00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:40,320
deployed to production and the

00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:42,690
production went down this is a reactive

00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:45,200
communication we have to talk we have to

00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:45,200
talk in that

00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:54,810
and frequent communication talk to each

00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:57,060
other frequently even if you have a

00:30:54,810 --> 00:30:59,160
regular schedule doesn't mean that you

00:30:57,060 --> 00:31:01,410
have to talk to each other only at that

00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:10,710
time keep on talking on a regular basis

00:31:01,410 --> 00:31:13,950
so basically what i am saying is that in

00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:16,590
a remote I mean set up there is nothing

00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:19,440
like over communicating because because

00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:23,250
of the fact that when your co located in

00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:26,460
a team you know you gain an incredible

00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:28,890
wealth of contextual information about

00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:32,580
your teammates just by being around them

00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:34,950
so I mean they those details might seem

00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:37,200
superfluous when we are talking or

00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:40,440
talking about it but they it really

00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:42,120
helps us out in understanding the team

00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:44,300
understanding how they are working what

00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:46,500
they are working on just by being around

00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:48,480
but because of the fact that you are

00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:51,270
working remotely that is something that

00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:54,180
you don't really get and that is where

00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:57,450
this comes in just talk of talk remotely

00:31:54,180 --> 00:32:00,690
I mean there have been cases where I

00:31:57,450 --> 00:32:04,110
mean we just shared a video of you know

00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:05,820
a dubsmash video of one of the friends

00:32:04,110 --> 00:32:08,910
when of our team has just shared it up

00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:11,400
smash video of their vice saying some

00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:14,540
Bollywood dialogue when just like that I

00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:16,500
mean that's what what I mean when I say

00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:18,720
communicate just like that because I

00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:21,030
just wanted to share it it it doesn't

00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:23,490
make sense when we talk about a team as

00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:25,590
such it's not important project wise but

00:32:23,490 --> 00:32:27,000
it's important to understand the people

00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:29,930
that you're working with and that's

00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:33,120
where communication comes in and

00:32:29,930 --> 00:32:36,020
whenever we have that richness of

00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:39,090
context by being around that is where

00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:42,150
trust building starts so that is why

00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:44,490
it's important the five communications

00:32:42,150 --> 00:32:47,520
is something that we really need to have

00:32:44,490 --> 00:32:49,140
so in remote teams communication is I

00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:55,910
think one of the most important things

00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:55,910
that we you know have to have yeah

00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:11,429
oh I might not be an expert of that but

00:33:09,509 --> 00:33:14,519
I can i can tell you how that works for

00:33:11,429 --> 00:33:15,659
us let's say so at this moment i will

00:33:14,519 --> 00:33:18,929
explain to you about our current

00:33:15,659 --> 00:33:22,980
scenario we have a small team in india

00:33:18,929 --> 00:33:24,960
delhi we have like six seven developers

00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:28,590
a manager you know kind of a team and

00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:30,659
then we have a US team as well so the

00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:33,120
regular standards that we have is we

00:33:30,659 --> 00:33:35,850
have I am talking about I'm talking

00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:37,799
timezone wise i am talking delhi time so

00:33:35,850 --> 00:33:39,840
we have a morning stand up with our team

00:33:37,799 --> 00:33:41,250
and we you know take the up days and we

00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:43,049
talk about what needs to be done today

00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:45,659
what was done today what was done

00:33:43,049 --> 00:33:48,090
yesterday and is there a blocker just a

00:33:45,659 --> 00:33:51,240
10 to 10 minutes stand up not more than

00:33:48,090 --> 00:33:53,279
that that's the way we go about and then

00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:55,200
in the evening we have a stand up with

00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:57,240
our US team as well in which the whole

00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:59,629
team in delhi and the whole team in the

00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:01,860
u.s. participates and then we talk about

00:33:59,629 --> 00:34:03,600
all these things which was watch

00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:07,220
whatever was accomplished today what are

00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:07,220
the priorities were two more etc etc

00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:19,919
sorry i am not able to hear you that is

00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:21,659
something i will be covering a bit in

00:34:19,919 --> 00:34:27,679
tools and then we can talk about that a

00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:27,679
bit more on that yep

00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,570
you

00:36:14,770 --> 00:36:17,430
No

00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:25,630
and I would say this is not a problem

00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:28,000
the problem that you just raised this is

00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:30,340
not a problem just in remoting this is a

00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:32,080
general problem in any kind of office I

00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:34,450
mean in offices there have been times

00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:35,920
when we have to take a call and the

00:36:34,450 --> 00:36:38,140
office is just too noisy you can't

00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:39,970
actually take a call you have to really

00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:42,190
go into a conference room shut yourself

00:36:39,970 --> 00:36:44,380
and maybe take a call so this is more of

00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:46,990
a general problem and I do agree with

00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:49,390
whatever what the solution it's it

00:36:46,990 --> 00:36:52,480
worked it this is a let's say a solution

00:36:49,390 --> 00:36:54,250
there's no fixed solution for this this

00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:57,610
is based on the chains and this is based

00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:59,320
on the the kind of environment the kind

00:36:57,610 --> 00:37:02,460
of setup you up in yes but yes that is

00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:02,460
one of the solutions yes

00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:27,510
yes

00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:44,730
and which is arranged ad hoc and

00:37:42,690 --> 00:37:47,309
everybody agrees to a particular time

00:37:44,730 --> 00:37:50,550
and then they are available at that time

00:37:47,309 --> 00:37:52,440
but other than that it's as you said

00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:54,119
that is more asynchronous so the other

00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:55,920
person responds as and when they are

00:37:54,119 --> 00:37:58,920
available as in when they are able to

00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:00,900
answer so he might they be we are

00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:03,119
developers and we go into a zone at

00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:06,480
times we don't want to be disturbed and

00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:09,390
at that time a skyping or a slack thing

00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:11,730
can be disastrous I do agree with us so

00:38:09,390 --> 00:38:13,980
again it depends from team to team from

00:38:11,730 --> 00:38:16,140
a person to person in how they want to

00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:22,950
manage it but it's a team decision I

00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:26,430
would say all right Oh remote working

00:38:22,950 --> 00:38:28,170
some very very important stuff and you

00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:29,940
won't believe I mean this might sound

00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:31,950
obvious to many of the people who are

00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:35,550
working remotely but you'd be surprised

00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:38,130
that I mean how many people and who want

00:38:35,550 --> 00:38:40,200
to work remotely they don't really miss

00:38:38,130 --> 00:38:45,660
and they don't really check all the

00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:48,270
boxes here the biggest biggest

00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:50,369
requirement for everybody of us if our

00:38:48,270 --> 00:38:53,910
internet is not working we are not

00:38:50,369 --> 00:38:57,119
working and this might not seem to be a

00:38:53,910 --> 00:39:00,150
big problem from for people who are from

00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:03,180
us maybe from Europe in India is a big

00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:05,040
problem it's real big problem so there

00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:07,619
was a time when i was working remotely

00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:10,049
and i had three different connections so

00:39:07,619 --> 00:39:11,760
a backup a backup of back I mean a main

00:39:10,049 --> 00:39:14,190
connection a backup and a back of a

00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:16,770
backup of backup because that's what

00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:18,690
happens the the connections are not

00:39:16,770 --> 00:39:20,849
stable so unless until you have a stable

00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:23,390
internet connection you cannot be a good

00:39:20,849 --> 00:39:23,390
remote worker

00:39:27,569 --> 00:39:34,019
this may or may as I said this may or

00:39:30,239 --> 00:39:37,109
may not be required but as she just

00:39:34,019 --> 00:39:38,999
pointed out that piece I mean and quiet

00:39:37,109 --> 00:39:41,119
and silences is one of the most

00:39:38,999 --> 00:39:45,229
important thing but what if you have a

00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:48,569
two-year-old toddler and then that

00:39:45,229 --> 00:39:50,339
silence is really difficult to have so

00:39:48,569 --> 00:39:53,940
you need to have a separate room a

00:39:50,339 --> 00:39:57,680
separate corner where you are you can

00:39:53,940 --> 00:40:03,449
work you know and that's I think really

00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:06,509
important you won't believe how many

00:40:03,449 --> 00:40:08,969
people don't agree to that and don't

00:40:06,509 --> 00:40:12,839
have that a good headset with speakers I

00:40:08,969 --> 00:40:14,609
have been on calls with people I mean

00:40:12,839 --> 00:40:16,410
they take a call just without any

00:40:14,609 --> 00:40:17,579
headset and without any speaker and then

00:40:16,410 --> 00:40:18,839
it becomes really difficult to

00:40:17,579 --> 00:40:21,449
understand they are not able to listen

00:40:18,839 --> 00:40:25,469
me I don't I am NOT able to listen to

00:40:21,449 --> 00:40:28,109
them and you know I just wanted to put

00:40:25,469 --> 00:40:30,089
this here because just to put the point

00:40:28,109 --> 00:40:31,589
across I know most of you are already

00:40:30,089 --> 00:40:33,779
working remotely and most of you will

00:40:31,589 --> 00:40:38,579
have all three of these but i think this

00:40:33,779 --> 00:40:41,130
very important now will be coming to the

00:40:38,579 --> 00:40:45,719
tools that we were we I said we'll be

00:40:41,130 --> 00:40:48,180
coming back to what are the tools that

00:40:45,719 --> 00:40:49,650
are really that really work for a remote

00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:55,769
setter what are the tools that really

00:40:49,650 --> 00:40:59,130
make a remote team work properly a very

00:40:55,769 --> 00:41:01,709
very good chat tool a chat tool which

00:40:59,130 --> 00:41:04,349
offers you calls which offers your video

00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:07,109
calls is preferable be currently

00:41:04,349 --> 00:41:09,599
you.flac but skype has worked for us

00:41:07,109 --> 00:41:12,390
very well at times we do switch to

00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:13,859
google hangouts slack is slack has an

00:41:12,390 --> 00:41:16,140
integration with google hangout so

00:41:13,859 --> 00:41:19,349
videos so essentially we use google

00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:22,140
hangouts a lot some people use you know

00:41:19,349 --> 00:41:24,449
campfire whatever works for the team but

00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:28,559
it's it's imperative that you have a

00:41:24,449 --> 00:41:30,900
single chat tool which which everybody

00:41:28,559 --> 00:41:33,779
is on because we don't want hundreds of

00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:37,319
different channels i have also mentioned

00:41:33,779 --> 00:41:40,490
what's up here I don't know if many of

00:41:37,319 --> 00:41:42,590
you know what what's happens so what's

00:41:40,490 --> 00:41:44,750
you should work it so essentially what's

00:41:42,590 --> 00:41:47,060
up is a phone application it works on

00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:49,970
the phone and that is essentially what

00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:53,540
we use within our team to connect but

00:41:49,970 --> 00:41:56,300
mostly for non non project and non work

00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:59,480
stuff so like I mentioned when we are

00:41:56,300 --> 00:42:02,000
sharing our dubsmash videos that's that

00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:04,190
will probably go on a what slap and not

00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:13,010
on the flat channel that's just a normal

00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:16,580
code of conduct that we follow okay as I

00:42:13,010 --> 00:42:19,070
mentioned a good video video tool video

00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:20,930
conference tool and I I would like to

00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:22,940
point out where we are saying

00:42:20,930 --> 00:42:25,580
conferencing tool and not just a video

00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:27,560
calling tool the reason here is that at

00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:29,030
times we there's just not one-on-one

00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:31,130
communication there are five people

00:42:29,030 --> 00:42:33,619
calling up for example the standards

00:42:31,130 --> 00:42:35,750
that we are having if we we have to have

00:42:33,619 --> 00:42:39,970
a good video conferencing tool skype

00:42:35,750 --> 00:42:43,070
google hangouts and it really helps if

00:42:39,970 --> 00:42:46,250
it has a screen share option because at

00:42:43,070 --> 00:42:49,520
times am I'll give an example so I am a

00:42:46,250 --> 00:42:52,040
developer and I fixed the ticket fixed a

00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:53,900
bug and gave it to my QA now the QA is

00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:55,670
saying that it's not working it's not

00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:57,980
working this just doesn't help me and

00:42:55,670 --> 00:43:00,050
they say they are able to reproduce it

00:42:57,980 --> 00:43:02,030
with certain steps so if they have a

00:43:00,050 --> 00:43:04,369
screen share option they are they

00:43:02,030 --> 00:43:06,680
showing the steps that they followed our

00:43:04,369 --> 00:43:08,750
baby I get them know you have to go

00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:16,250
there and not there that's where ensure

00:43:08,750 --> 00:43:19,520
really helps project management tools in

00:43:16,250 --> 00:43:22,940
aquia we use JIRA in my earlier company

00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:25,970
they had a home based homegrown version

00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:28,340
of red mine some people use Basecamp

00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:30,080
whatever works but it's important to

00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:32,980
stick to a project management tool and

00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:36,020
make sure that everything is there

00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:37,730
because it's in a remote team it's very

00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:39,050
important to keep on document everything

00:43:37,730 --> 00:43:41,780
when i say document i am not talking

00:43:39,050 --> 00:43:43,700
about writing down a big documentation

00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:46,430
about anything nope what i am saying

00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:49,460
essentially is that ok so there was a

00:43:46,430 --> 00:43:51,410
bug i had a call with my QA about that

00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:53,730
bug whatever was discussed there that

00:43:51,410 --> 00:43:57,720
she needs to go into JIRA because

00:43:53,730 --> 00:44:01,500
it's important to have the whole flow of

00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:03,240
whatever was discussed jira for us has

00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:07,310
really worked well I don't know if I

00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:07,310
mean for others what has been working

00:44:08,630 --> 00:44:13,740
document sharing Google Drive Google

00:44:11,369 --> 00:44:20,460
Docs I think this is something almost

00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:22,410
everybody here would be using this is a

00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:25,590
big question mark probably but for us

00:44:22,410 --> 00:44:27,270
for daca for our development tools for

00:44:25,590 --> 00:44:28,980
our development development to be able

00:44:27,270 --> 00:44:32,850
to share code and work collaboratively

00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:35,160
github has been helping us a lot there

00:44:32,850 --> 00:44:37,800
are some other tools get lab is a sort

00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:40,650
of a github version only only and that

00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:44,750
has also helped a lot of people but for

00:44:40,650 --> 00:44:44,750
us github has been working really well I

00:44:46,609 --> 00:44:54,480
think this is a really really important

00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:56,130
tool to have so for example i want to

00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:58,109
discuss at a certain feature that needs

00:44:56,130 --> 00:45:00,140
to come in the next print or i want to

00:44:58,109 --> 00:45:03,180
organize a sprint planning meeting

00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:05,490
google calendars allows me to be able to

00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:07,619
look at the agenda of everybody to the

00:45:05,490 --> 00:45:10,740
calendar of everybody and be able to

00:45:07,619 --> 00:45:20,880
schedule a meeting based working around

00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:23,490
their schedule this may or mine might

00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:25,650
not be useful for some but for me

00:45:23,490 --> 00:45:27,780
Evernote is really very important

00:45:25,650 --> 00:45:31,350
because that's where I I manage my own

00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:37,140
to deuce sketch for you know screen

00:45:31,350 --> 00:45:39,180
sharing and screenshots etc and if you

00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:43,380
are in a tree in which with very time

00:45:39,180 --> 00:45:48,780
zones this is really important I live in

00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:51,180
delhi indian timezone so and my are you

00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:54,240
esteem some of them are in portland some

00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:59,340
of them are in boston we have a project

00:45:54,240 --> 00:46:01,619
which is running in England so I mean

00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:04,290
I'm talking about just four time zones

00:46:01,619 --> 00:46:06,670
here then we have a team member who's in

00:46:04,290 --> 00:46:09,280
Australia the moment you five

00:46:06,670 --> 00:46:12,910
diamonds comes in calculation of plus

00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:14,770
12.3 and calculation of plus 5.33 is a

00:46:12,910 --> 00:46:19,270
nightmare so a good time zone converter

00:46:14,770 --> 00:46:22,210
clocks in fact on my on my machine on

00:46:19,270 --> 00:46:24,640
Chrome I have a nap I have a plug-in

00:46:22,210 --> 00:46:27,130
installed which on a blank sheet on

00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:29,080
whenever I open a new tab it gives me

00:46:27,130 --> 00:46:33,220
time zones of five different places

00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:35,200
which I'm really concerned about any

00:46:33,220 --> 00:46:42,190
other tool that you guys have used that

00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:46,030
you feel is really helpful when sorry so

00:46:42,190 --> 00:46:48,010
Trello would be I think it would

00:46:46,030 --> 00:46:50,050
probably come in a project management

00:46:48,010 --> 00:46:51,910
tool kind of a thing Trello is is a

00:46:50,050 --> 00:46:54,850
really get some for some people Trello

00:46:51,910 --> 00:46:57,520
has work then we have other versions of

00:46:54,850 --> 00:46:59,170
we have a sauna is something that some

00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:02,590
people have worked on there's so many

00:46:59,170 --> 00:47:04,810
things so i just mentioned what i have

00:47:02,590 --> 00:47:06,700
worked on and what has been working well

00:47:04,810 --> 00:47:16,000
for us but yes Trello is a tool that

00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:17,560
many people have used sorry Wanda I

00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:20,460
don't know what that is if you could

00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:20,460
explain that would be great

00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:57,850
awesome so Wunderlist that's what you're

00:47:51,310 --> 00:48:09,460
saying yeah okay great I saw another

00:47:57,850 --> 00:48:13,660
hand yep oh they are us I would not say

00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:16,120
for actual animation but for grooming of

00:48:13,660 --> 00:48:18,910
tickets and for planning of a sprint yes

00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:21,940
there are tools available so i don't

00:48:18,910 --> 00:48:25,180
know if you have heard of in like

00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:27,190
playing poker so there is a website

00:48:25,180 --> 00:48:30,150
which actually offers something like

00:48:27,190 --> 00:48:33,340
that i can give you a name of that I'll

00:48:30,150 --> 00:48:35,200
one of our teens uses it I have not used

00:48:33,340 --> 00:48:37,270
it so I don't remember that but there is

00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:39,340
for planning poker specifically there's

00:48:37,270 --> 00:48:41,650
already then for retrospective for

00:48:39,340 --> 00:48:43,750
example we have essentially three things

00:48:41,650 --> 00:48:46,420
when we are doing a retrospective what

00:48:43,750 --> 00:48:47,980
is going well what needs to what what

00:48:46,420 --> 00:48:50,260
should stop what should start and what

00:48:47,980 --> 00:48:51,970
needs to continue so for retrospectives

00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:53,860
also there is a tool which offers

00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:56,560
something like that so yes there are

00:48:53,860 --> 00:48:59,520
tons of tools available again it depends

00:48:56,560 --> 00:49:04,810
from team to team on what works for well

00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:11,860
for you and your team this was just an

00:49:04,810 --> 00:49:14,680
example of so as a manager as you were

00:49:11,860 --> 00:49:15,880
seeing then we were talking about jam as

00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:19,330
you were saying when we talking about

00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:21,940
trust this is where you know having a

00:49:19,330 --> 00:49:24,790
specific work plan and having a certain

00:49:21,940 --> 00:49:27,190
milestone kind of a thing of task list

00:49:24,790 --> 00:49:29,170
and that's when you keep on tracking

00:49:27,190 --> 00:49:31,000
those but when you keep on tracking your

00:49:29,170 --> 00:49:33,790
work plan that's where the trail starts

00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:35,650
building so this is really important as

00:49:33,790 --> 00:49:38,230
an employer or as a manager who's

00:49:35,650 --> 00:49:40,870
managing a remote team it's even more

00:49:38,230 --> 00:49:42,850
it's normally a to put that in a

00:49:40,870 --> 00:49:44,680
physical workplace yes having a role

00:49:42,850 --> 00:49:46,390
playing plan is important but it's more

00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:48,100
important when you are in a remote team

00:49:46,390 --> 00:49:50,520
because you have to keep on tracking

00:49:48,100 --> 00:49:50,520
stuff yeah

00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:58,660
I yes I agree that I agree on that

00:49:56,800 --> 00:50:00,130
because when you are trying to hire a

00:49:58,660 --> 00:50:02,650
person you don't know how to restore the

00:50:00,130 --> 00:50:09,910
others but you have to go on your gut

00:50:02,650 --> 00:50:12,430
feel on that very important as an

00:50:09,910 --> 00:50:15,400
employer as a manager you have to make

00:50:12,430 --> 00:50:17,410
sure that you have a regular face time

00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:19,630
with each and every person just a

00:50:17,410 --> 00:50:21,910
regular stand up of ten minutes per day

00:50:19,630 --> 00:50:24,760
doesn't really work because you have to

00:50:21,910 --> 00:50:28,510
understand what your employer is or what

00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:30,790
your team members are feeling and in a

00:50:28,510 --> 00:50:33,730
in a normal workplace that these kinds

00:50:30,790 --> 00:50:38,280
of things come to you from tone of a

00:50:33,730 --> 00:50:41,530
person from nonverbal communication but

00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:52,570
for remote teams this is what is really

00:50:41,530 --> 00:50:56,710
important yeah video cause video calls

00:50:52,570 --> 00:50:58,810
not flying all over I don't want I mean

00:50:56,710 --> 00:51:00,790
on one point we are saying we are saving

00:50:58,810 --> 00:51:05,560
and then we are flying people across

00:51:00,790 --> 00:51:07,540
that would not be saving and this is

00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:14,310
sort of a correlated thing from number

00:51:07,540 --> 00:51:16,780
two again it's not easy to be an

00:51:14,310 --> 00:51:18,880
employer of a remote team it's not easy

00:51:16,780 --> 00:51:20,860
to manage remote team because of so many

00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:23,950
non verbal forms of communications that

00:51:20,860 --> 00:51:26,620
are absent so this is we have to be

00:51:23,950 --> 00:51:28,780
aware of what is team expecting we have

00:51:26,620 --> 00:51:31,510
to set the team's expectations correctly

00:51:28,780 --> 00:51:34,000
and that's where again communication and

00:51:31,510 --> 00:51:38,350
a regular communication comes becomes

00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:40,060
very important as a remote team member

00:51:38,350 --> 00:51:42,310
that was the employees for employers

00:51:40,060 --> 00:51:44,800
perspective how what'd that guy needs to

00:51:42,310 --> 00:51:47,370
do and as a remote team member how can

00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:49,900
you be an effective remote team member I

00:51:47,370 --> 00:51:53,680
think this is one of the most important

00:51:49,900 --> 00:51:57,190
aspect being at home it's very easy to

00:51:53,680 --> 00:52:00,130
slip into the an undisciplined thing

00:51:57,190 --> 00:52:02,230
saying okay I need to log in at nine let

00:52:00,130 --> 00:52:04,210
me log in at nine thirty and tomorrow it

00:52:02,230 --> 00:52:06,530
will be ten it and the next date will be

00:52:04,210 --> 00:52:07,910
11 so it's important

00:52:06,530 --> 00:52:10,670
that you have that kind of self

00:52:07,910 --> 00:52:12,950
discipline and self focus to say that no

00:52:10,670 --> 00:52:14,810
I need to be online at you know nine

00:52:12,950 --> 00:52:17,090
o'clock because I need to do this kind

00:52:14,810 --> 00:52:18,650
of work it's more about discipline and

00:52:17,090 --> 00:52:23,500
self responsibility away enough

00:52:18,650 --> 00:52:26,110
awareness of responsibility feedback

00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:29,420
don't be shy of and giving feedback and

00:52:26,110 --> 00:52:32,570
don't and try to take take feedback

00:52:29,420 --> 00:52:34,850
instructively so both giving and taking

00:52:32,570 --> 00:52:40,100
or feedback is really important as an

00:52:34,850 --> 00:52:41,930
employee be available when I say be

00:52:40,100 --> 00:52:45,370
available I don't mean that you are

00:52:41,930 --> 00:52:48,440
available 24 us but what I mean is that

00:52:45,370 --> 00:52:50,540
you are working remotely yes but you

00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:53,450
have to understand it you're working in

00:52:50,540 --> 00:52:54,950
a team as well so be available for the

00:52:53,450 --> 00:52:57,200
teen so that if they have any questions

00:52:54,950 --> 00:52:58,880
for you if they have any clarifications

00:52:57,200 --> 00:53:04,040
they are able to clear that those things

00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:05,690
out up and the next thing is understand

00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:08,330
the impact so the moment you are

00:53:05,690 --> 00:53:10,790
unavailable the moment you are you

00:53:08,330 --> 00:53:13,490
decide to play hooky and you decide no

00:53:10,790 --> 00:53:17,570
let's let me not work today and let me

00:53:13,490 --> 00:53:20,180
go for go for some tourist thing or

00:53:17,570 --> 00:53:22,790
whatever it has an impact on your

00:53:20,180 --> 00:53:25,430
productivity yes but it also has an

00:53:22,790 --> 00:53:27,770
impact on the productivity of the team

00:53:25,430 --> 00:53:31,070
as a whole because it does happen that

00:53:27,770 --> 00:53:33,050
there is but some certain team member is

00:53:31,070 --> 00:53:35,630
looking is waiting for a feedback from

00:53:33,050 --> 00:53:37,340
you so it's important to understand if i

00:53:35,630 --> 00:53:41,560
am not available during this time what

00:53:37,340 --> 00:53:41,560
is the impact of that on my whole team

00:53:43,780 --> 00:53:50,450
as an employer as a company for example

00:53:47,780 --> 00:53:52,070
aquia it's important that regular face

00:53:50,450 --> 00:53:55,070
time is arranged we have regular

00:53:52,070 --> 00:53:57,770
retreats we have we participate in

00:53:55,070 --> 00:54:00,080
events where people can meet each other

00:53:57,770 --> 00:54:02,510
and you know we can connect to actual

00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:06,500
faces behind the thumbnails and behind

00:54:02,510 --> 00:54:09,230
the videos we I mean for example in

00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:11,990
aquia we had a retreat the india team

00:54:09,230 --> 00:54:13,730
retreat in goa in april then we are

00:54:11,990 --> 00:54:16,000
meeting we are flying to boston in

00:54:13,730 --> 00:54:20,490
october so all these things are really

00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:23,340
important also it is very important

00:54:20,490 --> 00:54:24,840
to with the tools i mean daesh the

00:54:23,340 --> 00:54:28,260
company should provide the tools but the

00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:30,300
processes for example when in a new

00:54:28,260 --> 00:54:33,470
remote employee joints it's important

00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:35,940
for them to not feel like orphans

00:54:33,470 --> 00:54:38,220
literally it's important to have a

00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:39,930
certain cultures or in certain process

00:54:38,220 --> 00:54:41,970
in place so that they have let's say

00:54:39,930 --> 00:54:44,190
maybe a body culture so whenever a new

00:54:41,970 --> 00:54:46,230
person joins is they have a virtual body

00:54:44,190 --> 00:54:50,850
who will be taking them across and you

00:54:46,230 --> 00:54:54,540
know across the whole system and I mean

00:54:50,850 --> 00:54:58,380
that's that's one of the unconventional

00:54:54,540 --> 00:55:01,770
ways i found was you know to feel

00:54:58,380 --> 00:55:05,280
connected turn you on the web web camera

00:55:01,770 --> 00:55:07,590
on the whole day and let it just so it

00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:09,630
is sort of a everybody anybody can come

00:55:07,590 --> 00:55:11,220
in and say hi i saw that in the are in

00:55:09,630 --> 00:55:14,100
our require office in the support thing

00:55:11,220 --> 00:55:15,840
they have a huge TV there and people

00:55:14,100 --> 00:55:19,800
have their webcams connected so anybody

00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:23,760
can just go and say hi this is something

00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:25,650
that has been foursquare has this

00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:27,780
implemented they call it the portal and

00:55:25,650 --> 00:55:29,550
so the interactions are not pre-planned

00:55:27,780 --> 00:55:32,820
they are very spontaneous and they have

00:55:29,550 --> 00:55:34,680
a huge cisco routers in this router but

00:55:32,820 --> 00:55:38,940
this can be done using your basic web

00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:43,470
camera as well and most important like I

00:55:38,940 --> 00:55:45,359
said earlier trust when you're in a team

00:55:43,470 --> 00:55:47,520
you have to trust as an employee you

00:55:45,359 --> 00:55:48,990
have to trust your employers and as an

00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:58,350
employer you have to trust your

00:55:48,990 --> 00:56:00,330
employees and this questions while we

00:55:58,350 --> 00:56:04,260
are looking at why we are taking

00:56:00,330 --> 00:56:08,000
questions and just some pictures I

00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:08,000
wanted to share yes

00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:27,360
this is really tricky tricky thing to

00:56:25,020 --> 00:56:29,580
master I mean I would not say I have

00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:32,570
mastered that for example I do take a

00:56:29,580 --> 00:56:34,860
lot of interviews and I do ask that the

00:56:32,570 --> 00:56:37,380
interview a lot of technical questions

00:56:34,860 --> 00:56:40,980
based on what they want to what based on

00:56:37,380 --> 00:56:42,900
the place but I do ask them a lot of non

00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:46,560
technical and behavioral questions as

00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:48,570
well and frankly speaking there are no

00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:50,520
specific set of questions that I ask

00:56:48,570 --> 00:56:53,880
it's more about how the flow of the

00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:55,410
interviews going and having that the

00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:58,470
answer to those behavioral questions

00:56:55,410 --> 00:57:01,530
really helps me understand on the kind

00:56:58,470 --> 00:57:03,030
of person that that guy is because most

00:57:01,530 --> 00:57:05,070
of those questions don't have a right or

00:57:03,030 --> 00:57:07,920
wrong answer it's just that the way they

00:57:05,070 --> 00:57:10,710
answer so I'm sorry I will not be able

00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:13,200
to really list out a few questions for

00:57:10,710 --> 00:57:14,400
you but not only technical questions

00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:15,660
behavioral questions are really

00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:19,220
important when you are taking an

00:57:15,660 --> 00:57:19,220
interest specially for remote employees

00:57:19,910 --> 00:57:26,460
just to tell you this was I mean we had

00:57:24,180 --> 00:57:28,410
organized a potluck so we had potluck at

00:57:26,460 --> 00:57:30,060
different locations because our team was

00:57:28,410 --> 00:57:35,220
in different locations so different

00:57:30,060 --> 00:57:36,510
locations different potlucks this was

00:57:35,220 --> 00:57:37,920
their inner retreat and this was a

00:57:36,510 --> 00:57:39,360
meeting that was happening you can see

00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:46,620
who is the only person working there

00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:49,710
that's me any other questions please as

00:57:46,620 --> 00:57:54,990
I said we have a whatsapp group and this

00:57:49,710 --> 00:57:57,140
is too funny to not share yeah you had a

00:57:54,990 --> 00:57:57,140
question

00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:08,800
the difference between the burgers we

00:58:06,250 --> 00:58:30,820
have a lot of untethered so they don't

00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:32,320
work at home yeah yes I'm maybe Agrium

00:58:30,820 --> 00:58:34,540
it depends on again on the person to

00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:36,400
person some people don't work very well

00:58:34,540 --> 00:58:40,030
that way but some people they want to

00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:43,540
explore the world and that's why but i

00:58:40,030 --> 00:58:45,670
really don't i don't know what to say

00:58:43,540 --> 00:58:47,710
about them i mean it depends entirely on

00:58:45,670 --> 00:58:50,050
person-to-person some people again I

00:58:47,710 --> 00:58:53,860
know of a person who has been traveling

00:58:50,050 --> 00:58:56,020
I mean from right from Italy he he's an

00:58:53,860 --> 00:58:58,060
American who's married to a Taiwanese so

00:58:56,020 --> 00:59:00,400
he has a home in Thailand but he lives

00:58:58,060 --> 00:59:02,770
in India a time so he's at stress she

00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:04,990
leaves for six months in India and then

00:59:02,770 --> 00:59:07,630
he'll plan okay no I want to go to the

00:59:04,990 --> 00:59:09,970
US will stay three years three months in

00:59:07,630 --> 00:59:12,790
the US and then he know I want to go to

00:59:09,970 --> 00:59:14,530
Italy and do some organic farming so

00:59:12,790 --> 00:59:17,650
people are like that it depends from

00:59:14,530 --> 00:59:19,810
person to person I have seen some people

00:59:17,650 --> 00:59:22,810
who don't work very well when they have

00:59:19,810 --> 00:59:27,330
to travel a lot so depends again any

00:59:22,810 --> 00:59:27,330
other questions please yeah

01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:16,110
yes

01:00:24,310 --> 01:00:29,410
I totally agree with that here so

01:00:27,130 --> 01:00:31,810
empathy is also really important when

01:00:29,410 --> 01:00:33,460
working in a remote environment I mean

01:00:31,810 --> 01:00:34,720
in remote teams so you need to

01:00:33,460 --> 01:00:38,980
understand what the person or the

01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:41,340
personals yep it's needed any other

01:00:38,980 --> 01:00:41,340
questions

01:00:49,060 --> 01:00:54,380
I have had people who have worked part

01:00:52,310 --> 01:00:57,770
time and they were a mooch and they

01:00:54,380 --> 01:01:01,430
worked well so I don't think that should

01:00:57,770 --> 01:01:04,310
be a concern there were people who were

01:01:01,430 --> 01:01:09,100
already studying but they wanted to earn

01:01:04,310 --> 01:01:09,100
you know then they worked remotely so

01:01:10,180 --> 01:01:14,350
