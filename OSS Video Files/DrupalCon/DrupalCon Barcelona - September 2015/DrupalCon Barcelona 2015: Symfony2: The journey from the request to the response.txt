Title: DrupalCon Barcelona 2015: Symfony2: The journey from the request to the response
Publication date: 2015-09-22
Playlist: DrupalCon Barcelona - September 2015
Description: 
	Let’s get in an adventure! Basically, what happens when a request is done until the response is rendered? When I first asked this question to a teammate, it was a pretext to see how I can learn most of concepts applied in the Symfony2 framework. This talk is about discovering (or re-discovering) how Symfony2 performs things internally to render a response: by going through a winding road, we’ll see how you can teach to your colleagues all of this.
