Title: DrupalCon Barcelona 2015: Symfony2: The journey from the request to the response
Publication date: 2015-09-22
Playlist: DrupalCon Barcelona - September 2015
Description: 
	Let’s get in an adventure! Basically, what happens when a request is done until the response is rendered? When I first asked this question to a teammate, it was a pretext to see how I can learn most of concepts applied in the Symfony2 framework. This talk is about discovering (or re-discovering) how Symfony2 performs things internally to render a response: by going through a winding road, we’ll see how you can teach to your colleagues all of this.

	00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:09,690
ok welcome how are you great ok I have

00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:13,710
three people here so welcome to my

00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:15,509
presentation I am the last one hopefully

00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:18,180
it would be interesting if you have any

00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:22,140
question feel free to ask there is a mic

00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:26,490
over there so just get up and ask you a

00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:29,429
question today I'm going to talk about

00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:31,500
Symphony a little bit about Drupal but

00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:35,280
you have to know that I'm not a Drupal

00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:39,090
east at all I tried it for Drupal

00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:41,340
version 8 and it was like very difficult

00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:43,739
to me because I'm from symphony and

00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:47,329
without all the objects and so on with

00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:49,800
the hooks and it was weird for me so

00:00:47,329 --> 00:00:54,149
yeah I'm going to talk about both

00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:58,170
symphony and robo Who am I I'm Sarah

00:00:54,149 --> 00:01:00,420
nice to meet you i'm working for sencha

00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:02,609
labs of course during the whole day

00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:07,040
everybody talked about since your lives

00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:09,840
in here but especially i'm working on

00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:13,020
central IRB's university if you want to

00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:15,450
know more about this structure just come

00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:18,450
see me I will be around actually I will

00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:21,470
be at the meetup I will talk about that

00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:24,030
later I'm a trainer and a developer and

00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:27,360
I love to share that's why I'm here

00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:31,320
today and yeah I'm trying to contribute

00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:35,100
to Symphony to as i'm sure you are doing

00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:39,000
the same with the drupal i'm living in

00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:42,689
Paris ok great city great city because

00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,670
there will be the symphony con so it

00:01:42,689 --> 00:01:47,759
will be in this in December and will be

00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:51,930
at a special place called the fully

00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:55,140
better so yeah if you want to come

00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:57,630
you're more than welcome so what's the

00:01:55,140 --> 00:02:00,930
plane today I'm going to talk about this

00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:02,250
is the philosophy of symphony then I'm

00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:04,259
going to talk a little bit about

00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:07,980
dependency injection which is the heart

00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:11,520
of symphony but that much because

00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:13,320
did it right before me and at the end i

00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,870
will talk a little bit about templating

00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:20,540
because have yall already talked about

00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:24,000
it before so let's begin with the

00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:26,250
philosophy you may know that when you

00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,230
are doing the web application most of

00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:31,710
the time the protocol that you are using

00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:35,820
is HTTP ok when we are talking about

00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:41,040
HTTP HTTP you we have the request ok

00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:44,280
which is basically some text with the

00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:46,260
method we have the URI and of course we

00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:48,420
have the protocol then we could have

00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:54,090
some headers and of course a body for

00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:57,000
the request then when we want to respond

00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:59,970
something we use a response and HTTP

00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,850
response which is like you can see here

00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:05,130
most of the time we forget about that

00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:09,810
but yeah the job of symphony is

00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:12,750
basically to do that ok so maybe you

00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:16,290
heard that symphony is a MVC framework

00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:18,440
actually it's not just an HTTP framework

00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:21,540
and if you are talking about

00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:24,450
architecture what Symphony provides you

00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:28,020
actually is the view layer and the

00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:32,489
controller layer ok so I'm going to

00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:35,100
explain this big thing don't worry it's

00:03:32,489 --> 00:03:39,959
going to be ok we will go stay bad state

00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:42,270
ok so yeah first the HTTP requests we

00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:47,580
just saw it before so we have it from

00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:51,209
internet basically and yeah we receive

00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:53,850
it from all maybe yeah in the front

00:03:51,209 --> 00:03:56,670
controller ok when I'm talking about the

00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:58,560
front controller if you are a symphony

00:03:56,670 --> 00:04:03,150
developer I'm talking about the app that

00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:06,930
PHP in Drupal is the index that PHP ok

00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:09,750
and the job of this one controller is

00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:13,380
basically to turn the request that comes

00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:16,320
from the HTTP for a protocol to an

00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:20,870
object ok which is part of the HTTP

00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:24,620
foundation so yeah and

00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:26,540
after that we need to communicate with

00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:29,240
the HTTP car now we will see that right

00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:33,190
after so two components involved here

00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:36,410
which is which are used by drupal first

00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:38,419
first the HTTP foundation which is an

00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:41,449
abstraction of the request and the

00:04:38,419 --> 00:04:44,360
response that we know from the HTTP

00:04:41,449 --> 00:04:48,770
protocol and we have the HTTP kernel

00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:51,530
which has one responsibility which is

00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:55,520
joining a response in a request to a

00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:58,220
response ok so again in Drupal is just

00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:03,229
the index dot PHP and here it's just a

00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:06,650
Drupal version eight I got for myself to

00:05:03,229 --> 00:05:08,930
try it ok and in there we can see those

00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:12,500
lines especially the one the biggest one

00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:15,050
which is getting a request on the right

00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:18,560
side on yeah on the right side and

00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:21,770
turning it to response ok so the first

00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:23,630
time is basically creating the request

00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:25,250
from the Global's when we're talking

00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:28,220
about the Global's of course we are

00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:31,430
talking about the global variable of PHP

00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:34,970
dollar underscore get dollar underscore

00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:37,490
post and so on to get the object and

00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:40,460
then yeah Tony needs to respond then

00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:44,450
send it basically just a nickel with a

00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:47,870
header and that's it now we can go

00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:51,320
further with this time the routing

00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:54,320
component and the routine component here

00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:56,599
has one responsibility actually it has

00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:59,810
to that we are going going just to talk

00:05:56,599 --> 00:06:02,750
about this one is basically to map a URL

00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:05,680
to a set of parameters that's basically

00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:08,780
what i'm showing you right above or

00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:11,560
underneath so we have the name of the

00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:17,960
route we have the uri that we want to

00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:20,599
match with a callable actually when in

00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:22,789
here you see that's it's a controller so

00:06:20,599 --> 00:06:25,460
the special undersell controller is very

00:06:22,789 --> 00:06:27,500
important because it's a natural beauty

00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:30,500
that is used by the by the routing

00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:33,380
components saying okay you are going to

00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:34,249
call this controller with this special

00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:40,549
method with

00:06:34,249 --> 00:06:43,849
which is index action okay and yeah just

00:06:40,549 --> 00:06:45,769
for the record the second responsibility

00:06:43,849 --> 00:06:50,539
of the written component is for

00:06:45,769 --> 00:06:53,559
generating URLs ok so in Drupal we have

00:06:50,539 --> 00:06:56,029
this file that will need to complete and

00:06:53,559 --> 00:06:59,569
we have to follow this convention which

00:06:56,029 --> 00:07:01,849
is the name of the module that watching

00:06:59,569 --> 00:07:03,739
the channel ok you will see that all the

00:07:01,849 --> 00:07:06,019
configuration is in llamo maybe you

00:07:03,739 --> 00:07:07,789
already know that but it was a premiere

00:07:06,019 --> 00:07:10,159
for me because all the time for the

00:07:07,789 --> 00:07:14,509
routing in symphony I'm always using the

00:07:10,159 --> 00:07:20,269
annotations so as new for me ok now we

00:07:14,509 --> 00:07:22,459
can go further in our kind of I and now

00:07:20,269 --> 00:07:25,569
it's about calling the controller of

00:07:22,459 --> 00:07:27,919
course because remember the

00:07:25,569 --> 00:07:31,369
responsibility of the routine component

00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:33,859
is basically mapping your right to a set

00:07:31,369 --> 00:07:37,249
of parameters which is underscore

00:07:33,859 --> 00:07:39,529
controller which is my controller and of

00:07:37,249 --> 00:07:43,039
course i have my model in view because

00:07:39,529 --> 00:07:45,860
the controller has some responsibilities

00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:49,549
which is making sure that the

00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:52,759
communication between the model and the

00:07:49,549 --> 00:07:57,199
view is done correctly ok and of course

00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:59,659
a controller has one main responsibility

00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:01,939
which is returning a response ok

00:07:59,659 --> 00:08:04,029
remember the philosophy of symphony is

00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:07,909
getting your requests and answer

00:08:04,029 --> 00:08:12,519
response so basically you have this kind

00:08:07,909 --> 00:08:14,809
of code ok and yeah we don't have much

00:08:12,519 --> 00:08:17,809
we're just returning a response with

00:08:14,809 --> 00:08:20,779
some content ok i will show you that

00:08:17,809 --> 00:08:22,339
after when we will talk about completing

00:08:20,779 --> 00:08:25,159
that in Drupal actually you don't have

00:08:22,339 --> 00:08:29,119
to answer a response to return a

00:08:25,159 --> 00:08:31,549
response it's an array and I when I

00:08:29,119 --> 00:08:34,159
discussed with some Drupal lists it's

00:08:31,549 --> 00:08:38,389
always about array in Drupal so I'm not

00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:40,969
lost ok so let's go further this time

00:08:38,389 --> 00:08:43,129
and yeah we have just one job here

00:08:40,969 --> 00:08:47,529
returning an HTTP foundational response

00:08:43,129 --> 00:08:51,290
oh yeah we have

00:08:47,529 --> 00:08:53,450
the HTTP response and that's it this is

00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:57,260
the main goal of symphony that's why

00:08:53,450 --> 00:09:01,550
drupal used HTTP foundation HTTP colonel

00:08:57,260 --> 00:09:06,920
some of the routing component but there

00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:10,700
is more okay just wait for it it's the

00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:15,470
event system and I know that you are

00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:17,870
used to hooks and it looks like hooks

00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:21,080
but it's not the same because it's not

00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:23,420
in a in a script with some functions and

00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:28,250
so on it's all object so let me explain

00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:30,890
you the even dispatcher component helps

00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:34,390
you to easily decouple code and plug-in

00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:39,589
new features okay that way you're not

00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:42,529
obliged to narrate from any object to

00:09:39,589 --> 00:09:45,589
add new features okay so two main

00:09:42,529 --> 00:09:48,230
concepts here we have the dispatching of

00:09:45,589 --> 00:09:51,110
an event so let's say okay something

00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:54,410
happened and the second concept is

00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:59,540
basically to listen or subscribe to that

00:09:54,410 --> 00:10:02,870
event ok so the event it's an object

00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:05,180
again and in there you just have two

00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:08,750
stores or some information that you need

00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:11,270
in your listeners ok that way from

00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:13,490
listeners to listeners you can grab some

00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:17,959
information and pass it to the next one

00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:20,690
ok the listener it's just a very PHP

00:10:17,959 --> 00:10:25,100
code level and most of the time it will

00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:27,470
be of course and objects and yeah when I

00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:29,779
see a label it could be anything that

00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:32,870
you know in PHP which are a function

00:10:29,779 --> 00:10:35,600
named an instant an instance method or a

00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:39,380
static method or a closure or lambda

00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:42,200
function ok maybe you heard about this

00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:44,120
difference as I'm doing a lot of

00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:46,310
training most of the time people are

00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:48,920
asking what is the difference between an

00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:51,770
event listener and an even subscriber a

00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:54,440
matter of taste actually ok so let me

00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:57,649
show you some code don't be afraid in

00:10:54,440 --> 00:11:00,050
here I'm showing you

00:10:57,649 --> 00:11:03,139
and even subscriber and basically we

00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:06,379
have a class that has to implement the

00:11:03,139 --> 00:11:08,540
even subscriber interface and you see

00:11:06,379 --> 00:11:11,300
that the this interface is coming from

00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:14,929
the event dispatcher component of course

00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:17,559
okay as we are implementing an interface

00:11:14,929 --> 00:11:20,720
there is some contract to fulfill and

00:11:17,559 --> 00:11:23,509
the contract is to implement the static

00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:26,959
method called get subscribed events in

00:11:23,509 --> 00:11:29,540
there we have to return an array which

00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:34,160
is the name of the event we are

00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:36,740
listening to and we have also the method

00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:38,360
that we need to call the method we need

00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:41,029
to call is of course in the same class

00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:43,670
of the listener okay i'm not showing

00:11:41,029 --> 00:11:45,589
this to you because you may know that

00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:49,220
the public function in here for the

00:11:45,589 --> 00:11:52,160
article that save it will be on insult

00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:56,240
article okay the little number right

00:11:52,160 --> 00:12:00,759
next to the method is the priority so

00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:04,779
the highest priority you have the higher

00:12:00,759 --> 00:12:08,420
the sooner the listener will be executed

00:12:04,779 --> 00:12:12,379
okay in here i can see when i'm reading

00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:16,819
this that for this the event article dot

00:12:12,379 --> 00:12:20,540
safe i have two method that will be cold

00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:22,759
okay the priority is five then 10 so

00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:26,079
basically on insult article will be

00:12:22,759 --> 00:12:30,939
executed before the on update article

00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:34,579
okay we have also the article delete and

00:12:30,939 --> 00:12:37,279
it's another event and of course we will

00:12:34,579 --> 00:12:40,339
call the method on delete article which

00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:44,449
is priority 0 actually by default its

00:12:40,339 --> 00:12:47,149
priority 0 okay in there as you can see

00:12:44,449 --> 00:12:49,370
when you are opening the subscriber you

00:12:47,149 --> 00:12:52,220
already know which events you are

00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:55,549
subscribing to what is the priority and

00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:59,779
of course which method you are going to

00:12:55,549 --> 00:13:03,889
execute ok remind this for the listener

00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:06,350
after you have a second step to fulfil

00:13:03,889 --> 00:13:09,690
which is adding to subscriber to the

00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:12,900
dispatcher I didn't tell you that

00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:16,230
actually the even system is driven by

00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:17,940
the event dispatcher of course so they

00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:22,260
even dispatcher is basically just an

00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:24,510
object and on this you just have to call

00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:26,940
the method at subscriber of course

00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:30,030
Interpol you don't have to do this it's

00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:34,170
only if you are doing let's say an

00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:36,210
application plain old PHP application

00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:38,160
and you are just using the event

00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:40,910
dispatcher component if you are doing

00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:43,940
that you're obliged to instantiate the

00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:48,560
even dispatcher then add the subscriber

00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:52,410
okay we will see after when will be

00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:54,150
young in one or two slides okay we know

00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:58,110
about subscriber now what is the

00:13:54,150 --> 00:14:01,110
difference with between with event

00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:03,210
listener this time the listener is also

00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:05,430
a class of course you can see that there

00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:07,590
is no interface to implement this time

00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:10,260
and of course we have to implement a

00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:13,500
method could be anything most of the

00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:16,520
time we use the on Colonel request on

00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:20,040
Colonel exception on Colonel blah blah

00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:22,830
because in here we know that it's

00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:25,740
listening we know because we know

00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:28,350
symphony okay that we are listening to

00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:30,060
the colonel dot requests events I will

00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:33,360
talk about the events that are triggered

00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:37,020
by symphony in there I'm just doing some

00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:39,240
stuff like making sure that I'm in the

00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:42,540
master request when I'm talking about

00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:46,830
master request it's basically that you

00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:50,820
could have several requests in one at at

00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:54,360
one time let's say I'm I want to display

00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:56,790
the page / users okay and in there I

00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:59,040
could do when I do in there when I say

00:14:56,790 --> 00:15:01,350
in there it's in the controller in the

00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:03,780
controller I could do some things and do

00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:06,480
a forward and when I do forward I'm

00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:08,850
calling basically another controller and

00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:11,460
when I'm doing that I'm doing a sub

00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:15,000
request and so on I could have many

00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:19,470
requests aisles I need actually so

00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:22,100
that's why yeah maybe you will hear

00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:24,600
about the request a key maybe

00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:28,079
okay so I'm just making sure that I'm

00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:31,110
the beginning of the stack of the

00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:33,810
request otherwise I'm returning and it

00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:36,480
does nothing okay after that I'm just

00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:39,690
getting some attributes from the request

00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:42,480
you can see that as I said before in the

00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:44,370
event i have some information in there I

00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:47,490
just make sure that I have the megiddo

00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:49,889
request and basically Symphony to care

00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:52,829
about setting the request at some point

00:15:49,889 --> 00:15:56,360
so I just get it I get some attributes

00:15:52,829 --> 00:15:59,579
which is underscore file in there and

00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:02,339
setting a response if I'm setting on a

00:15:59,579 --> 00:16:05,910
response in here it's just saying okay

00:16:02,339 --> 00:16:10,110
you are going to finish all the things

00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:13,709
you wanted to do and go and call them

00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:16,920
and go back to to the front controller

00:16:13,709 --> 00:16:21,930
and then send the request as you know

00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:25,500
the HTTP response okay so basically what

00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:27,930
you can see here is that in your events

00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:30,630
events subscriber event listener you can

00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:34,079
set a response at whenever you want

00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:36,300
actually okay so you do this class you

00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:38,910
would you do this method and the second

00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:40,949
step is basically to add the listener to

00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:43,620
your dispatcher like the subscriber but

00:16:40,949 --> 00:16:45,899
this time it's the method addlistener in

00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:50,370
there you can see that there are there

00:16:45,899 --> 00:16:53,310
are more arguments of course we have the

00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:56,970
event we are listening to in here you

00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:59,430
can see that i'm using the constant it's

00:16:56,970 --> 00:17:02,069
a good practice actually to use

00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:05,640
constants instead of the name of the

00:17:02,069 --> 00:17:10,069
event directly and I'm just saying okay

00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:14,100
when the event will be triggered I will

00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:16,350
symphony has to call this class called

00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:19,410
my listener with the method on calendar

00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:22,079
request okay so basically the difference

00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:24,510
between the two is again a matter of

00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:26,010
taste I prefer the subscriber because

00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:29,280
when you open the class you see

00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:30,990
everything you need but you can do

00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:34,830
whatever you want and actually

00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:37,410
you may know that's about the priority

00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:40,140
of course for the least now you can put

00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:44,610
another everything you want about the

00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:47,610
priority at the end symphony just do all

00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:51,650
the subscriber becomes listeners and of

00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:57,600
course listeners stay the listeners okay

00:17:51,650 --> 00:18:00,420
alright so yeah I talked about events I

00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:03,390
talked about listeners even subscriber

00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:06,150
even listeners but I didn't talk about

00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:09,179
the fact that you have to trigger the

00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:11,010
events okay to trigger an event it's

00:18:09,179 --> 00:18:14,150
really easy you have to get the

00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:16,650
dispatcher which is here I'm

00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:19,260
instantiating the event dispatcher then

00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:23,510
on the do yeah the event dispatcher on

00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:26,220
this up calling the method dispatch the

00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:28,740
the arguments are really easy to

00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:31,110
understand the first one is the event

00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:34,770
and the second one of course is the

00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:38,340
event which has all the information we

00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:39,960
need to make sure that in your listeners

00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:45,960
you will have all the information you

00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:48,090
need easy right ok so I told you that in

00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:50,970
Drupal and in Symphony actually you

00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:53,190
don't have to do this you have to do

00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:57,750
this only if you are using the component

00:18:53,190 --> 00:19:01,080
by itself in your PHP project let's say

00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:04,740
you want to migrate from an old PHP

00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:06,960
application to symphony step by step you

00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:09,360
don't want to change everything you can

00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:11,309
just grab a components install it and

00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:15,390
yeah okay let's say we won't even

00:19:11,309 --> 00:19:19,320
dispatcher now ok so in Drupal you just

00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:26,460
have to create a service to create a

00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:29,780
service you have to create a file yeah

00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:32,410
in your model and your this file has to

00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:35,240
fulfill the

00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:37,970
yeah this constraint which is the name

00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:42,320
of your module that services the channel

00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:45,350
okay it's at the root of your of your

00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:47,990
module and in there you can see that

00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:50,690
there is a special key services you have

00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:54,620
to put it it's important because it's a

00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:57,590
service i just put after that the name

00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:59,660
of my service which is whether that job

00:19:57,590 --> 00:20:03,410
underscore listener could be anything

00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:04,640
actually then I'm just saying okay this

00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:08,240
is the class you are going to

00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:11,360
instantiate there is maybe some

00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:14,780
arguments because my listener needs an

00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:18,230
email in the constructor and what is

00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:21,710
very important is the tag okay by just

00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:24,440
saying this service has the tag event

00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:26,450
dispatcher even subscriber sorry I'm

00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:29,090
just saying okay it's going to be a

00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:31,520
subscriber and it will be loaded and so

00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:34,220
on okay so Interpol you just have to

00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:36,740
create the class and then just declare

00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:40,400
it as a service with the tag same thing

00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:43,490
for the event listener but this time you

00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:46,160
have to put some more information which

00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:48,890
is which are sorry the event you are

00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:50,870
listening to and the method you are

00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:54,590
going to call when the event is

00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:58,400
triggered okay if you are if you have

00:20:54,590 --> 00:21:01,310
several methods in your listener your

00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:04,160
event listener that you want to execute

00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:06,770
when the colonel

00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:09,230
the candidate request is triggered you

00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:12,290
just have to add one line and one-liners

00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:13,940
and again okay in the event is a

00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:15,260
subscriber of course you don't have to

00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:17,720
do that's kind that kind of thing

00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:22,180
because everything is done in the gate

00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:26,900
subscribe events studying young method

00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:29,150
okay I talked about one event which is

00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:31,910
channel dot request actually in

00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:37,130
something in symfony2 that seven we have

00:21:31,910 --> 00:21:40,720
sex and yeah it's really important to

00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:44,300
know them and when to hook your code

00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:46,130
because yeah you have to know that the

00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:48,950
candidates request is the first even

00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:51,080
that is triggered the second one is the

00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:55,670
count the colonel the controller and

00:21:51,080 --> 00:22:01,310
basically it's when the Rooter component

00:21:55,670 --> 00:22:04,940
already know which which co level he it

00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:07,010
has to call regarding the URI okay so at

00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:09,590
this point you know which co level you

00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:12,110
have to to have so basically your

00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:14,840
controller the colonel that view is

00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:18,290
triggered only if your controller

00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:20,870
doesn't return a response okay it's

00:22:18,290 --> 00:22:22,700
really useful for Drupal because of

00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:25,130
course in your controller you will see

00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:27,140
that you have to return an array so of

00:22:25,130 --> 00:22:30,290
course there is a listener its name to

00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:33,980
this kind of event to make sure that it

00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:35,840
grabs the array you're returning and

00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:39,400
make sure thats it returns the right

00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:42,170
response regarding the theme and so on

00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:44,900
the candidate response of course is

00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:48,650
triggered when the response is returned

00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:51,590
okay so at some point you want maybe to

00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:54,590
change the response or whatever we want

00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:57,020
and you have the colonel determinate

00:22:54,590 --> 00:23:01,760
which is triggered when an exception

00:22:57,020 --> 00:23:05,750
occurred Oh actually there there are 77

00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:08,000
events sorry I forgot one and you have

00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:12,050
the colonel dot finish request which is

00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:16,280
triggered only if actually it's useful

00:23:12,050 --> 00:23:18,660
only if you have php-fpm and

00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:23,910
you will see in the documentation of

00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:30,630
symphony that basically this event is

00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:33,660
useful only to perform some action that

00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:36,210
you don't want to wait for to display

00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:40,350
the response so let's say you want to

00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:42,990
send a thousands of emails okay but you

00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:46,100
don't want to wait for the mailer to

00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:50,010
send all the emails to send you know the

00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:53,780
response to your user okay so you just

00:23:50,010 --> 00:23:57,540
have to hook on this event and make your

00:23:53,780 --> 00:24:00,540
logic in this listener to send all the

00:23:57,540 --> 00:24:03,060
emails but don't forget that you need to

00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:06,660
have php-fpm otherwise it's not useful

00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:08,940
at all and yeah the 7th actually is the

00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:11,820
CalNet that exception forgot about that

00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:14,430
and of course it's triggered when there

00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:17,280
is an exception and basically you will

00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:20,400
see that when you are throwing an

00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:23,460
exception I never tried in Drupal but in

00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:26,390
symphony when you are throwing an

00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:29,880
exception you will see that there is no

00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:31,920
there is a response actually because

00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:34,370
there is a listener listening to this

00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:38,010
special event making sure that it gets

00:24:34,370 --> 00:24:40,230
the type of the exception and returns

00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:43,140
the right response when I say the right

00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:46,650
response could be some content with the

00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:54,300
right status code let's say 40 4 or 500

00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:58,280
and so on okay so all together now we

00:24:54,300 --> 00:25:01,380
have the HTTP request we are turning its

00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:04,590
we are just receiving it in our front

00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:06,870
controller in the index dot PHP we have

00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:10,350
the HTTP kernel with the special method

00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:12,600
handle which takes a request and has to

00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:15,270
reach on a response but of course for

00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:17,430
that we need some controller for this

00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:20,580
controller it goes by the written

00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:22,560
component in your controller of course

00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:23,630
you have some communication with the

00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:26,290
model layer and

00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:29,450
view layer at the end we have of course

00:25:26,290 --> 00:25:32,240
an HTTP foundation response could be

00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:34,760
written by yourself or by a listener or

00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:37,910
whatever you want and at the end of

00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:39,680
course you have the HTTP response and at

00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:41,780
some point you could have the event

00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:49,130
listener an event is now or an event

00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:51,800
subscriber okay easy actually if you

00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:54,830
understand that you can it's only useful

00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:58,070
to know where is the code when you know

00:25:54,830 --> 00:26:00,650
when you don't know where does where the

00:25:58,070 --> 00:26:01,940
things is going on because yeah most of

00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:04,130
the time you will put everything in the

00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:07,460
controller and so on just remember that

00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:10,640
there is some things here and there you

00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:13,820
know the whole thing would be okay so

00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:19,010
let's talk about Drupal 8 and symphony a

00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:23,060
story of love I guess here are the

00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:25,340
components that are used by drupal we

00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:27,920
saw actually the symphony event

00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:32,930
dispatcher we saw the HTTP foundation of

00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:36,770
course we saw the routine with so HTTP

00:26:32,930 --> 00:26:39,800
chrono and that's it but they are the

00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:42,730
main ones okay now I'm just going to

00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:46,490
talk about the dependency injection one

00:26:42,730 --> 00:26:50,420
so actually I'm just going to talk about

00:26:46,490 --> 00:26:53,960
what is the point of doing services and

00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:57,670
what is the service container the

00:26:53,960 --> 00:27:00,950
parameters and so on so the dependency

00:26:57,670 --> 00:27:02,870
injection component just allows you to

00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:05,960
standardize and centralize the way

00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:08,720
object or constructed so what I'm saying

00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:11,840
here it's just that the dependency

00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:15,410
injection component is just managing the

00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:19,310
way the services so the objects are

00:27:15,410 --> 00:27:22,130
instantiated so it does just knew knew

00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:26,060
the object deem the class and that's it

00:27:22,130 --> 00:27:28,100
okay what you are going to do is some

00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:31,100
configuration to make sure that the

00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:34,820
instantiation of this class is done

00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:36,860
correctly that's it so three main

00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:40,130
concepts about the

00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:42,440
Injection compared container component

00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:44,750
sorry the first one is of course the

00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:48,650
service container the second one are the

00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:51,140
services of course and parameters so the

00:27:48,650 --> 00:27:53,840
service container as I said before is

00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:58,040
just here to manage the instantiation of

00:27:53,840 --> 00:28:02,210
your classes and when I say classes of

00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:04,790
course I'm talking about services it

00:28:02,210 --> 00:28:06,980
makes sure that you when you want to get

00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:11,559
a service it gets always the same

00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:15,230
instance and it stores some parameters

00:28:11,559 --> 00:28:16,910
that's it so it's a big object that just

00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:21,530
make sure that the instantiation of the

00:28:16,910 --> 00:28:24,169
classes are done very correctly what is

00:28:21,530 --> 00:28:27,160
a service it's not that easy to

00:28:24,169 --> 00:28:29,690
understand when you don't do services

00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:31,910
maybe most of the time when we are doing

00:28:29,690 --> 00:28:35,240
some logic you are doing this in your

00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:37,580
model layer and in the model layer you

00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:41,059
could have let's say a domain objects

00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:43,220
could be user it could be a dress it

00:28:41,059 --> 00:28:45,980
could be I don't know anything you want

00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:50,179
and you put some methods that can

00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:55,809
contains a lot of code and that's it but

00:28:50,179 --> 00:28:58,520
a service is not the way you you think

00:28:55,809 --> 00:29:01,190
when I began with a symphony and

00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:03,559
framework and services and so on I was

00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:06,230
like okay or service is just a class

00:29:03,559 --> 00:29:11,299
where I can put some logic and that's it

00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:14,450
okay actually it's not that's wrong but

00:29:11,299 --> 00:29:16,910
you just have to ask one question when

00:29:14,450 --> 00:29:21,020
you want to do a service does it have a

00:29:16,910 --> 00:29:24,530
state and when we are talking about a

00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:28,640
user an address or I don't know a chair

00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:30,440
and so on it has a state okay so it's a

00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:32,330
domain object it's not a service you

00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:37,070
have to remember that the service is

00:29:32,330 --> 00:29:39,980
basically just a PHP object that can

00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:42,490
perform global task when I say global

00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:44,540
task it could be a mailer a logger

00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:48,310
something that can grow

00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:51,950
information from your database and so on

00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:54,830
okay that's basically what I'm saying

00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:57,410
here and what is the parameter it's just

00:29:54,830 --> 00:30:01,370
global configuration so you will have

00:29:57,410 --> 00:30:04,520
just key value that you can use whenever

00:30:01,370 --> 00:30:08,180
you want if you have access to the

00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:12,320
container okay in Drupal what I said

00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:16,310
before is that when you are declaring

00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:19,790
some services and parameters you have to

00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:22,090
put it in this file which is the name of

00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:27,020
the module that services the channel

00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:29,150
okay and it looks like this we saw a

00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:31,910
little bit before about the event

00:30:29,150 --> 00:30:33,890
subscriber and event listener in here

00:30:31,910 --> 00:30:36,740
i'm just adding the part of with

00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:40,490
parameters okay and i just it before

00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:44,030
it's just key value okay and in your

00:30:40,490 --> 00:30:46,130
services as you are just saying okay I

00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:49,190
have a parameter called weather and dusk

00:30:46,130 --> 00:30:51,140
on end point I can use it in the

00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:54,620
services let's say in an argument with

00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:56,570
the person sign okay when you are using

00:30:54,620 --> 00:31:00,430
the special person sign you're just

00:30:56,570 --> 00:31:04,460
saying okay grab it from the parameters

00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:07,420
easy the at sign is just saying okay

00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:12,530
this special string is going to be

00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:14,990
referencing to another service okay so

00:31:12,530 --> 00:31:18,590
you have to know that for the arguments

00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:21,560
it could be a strain a service it could

00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:25,250
be a collection could be a constant also

00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:32,480
but in llamo you can't use PHP constants

00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:34,700
so sorry and yeah about the tags just a

00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:36,290
quick for a man a reminder I didn't I

00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:39,650
don't know if I a talked about that but

00:31:36,290 --> 00:31:41,990
the tag is just a sticker saying okay

00:31:39,650 --> 00:31:46,100
this service is really special you have

00:31:41,990 --> 00:31:49,310
to treat it in a different way and as

00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:51,980
you can see here I'm tagging the service

00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:53,350
whether job on the Scott listener only

00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:55,539
because I want to make sure

00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:58,210
that is going to be treated differently

00:31:55,539 --> 00:32:02,049
because I want to make sure that it's an

00:31:58,210 --> 00:32:08,260
even subscriber so cold when an event is

00:32:02,049 --> 00:32:10,210
triggered okay about the templating so

00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:14,350
don't worry we are going to talk about

00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:17,860
that basically in your code you have

00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:24,160
this kind of cool okay so in here we are

00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:27,340
in in template called lay out that way

00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:30,789
and in there you have just HTML code

00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:33,760
what you can see is that you have kind

00:32:30,789 --> 00:32:36,490
of different things which are the block

00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:38,650
right here i have a blog title i have a

00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:42,520
blog style sheets i have a blog content

00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:47,260
and then javascript here if you were not

00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:50,890
at the talk of javea it's basically

00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:55,360
place orders he called it some holes

00:32:50,890 --> 00:32:58,059
it's it's really nice to see because in

00:32:55,360 --> 00:33:00,760
here you can see that basically in your

00:32:58,059 --> 00:33:03,340
HTML code you're just putting some yeah

00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:08,789
some blogs right in there that you can

00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:13,230
actually override okay to override them

00:33:08,789 --> 00:33:16,120
you just have to extend from the

00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:20,650
template we saw before which is the

00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:23,980
layout twig and just creating the block

00:33:20,650 --> 00:33:26,620
that are already defined in the parent

00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:29,559
so here I'm just doing inheritance of

00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:35,140
course you can do more with Tom placing

00:33:29,559 --> 00:33:38,860
and twig ok so again i hope the

00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:40,990
presentation of haha will be up soon but

00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:42,970
of course you have a lot of

00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:44,650
documentation about that but basically

00:33:42,970 --> 00:33:48,700
when you are beginning with the

00:33:44,650 --> 00:33:51,370
templating part it's yeah it's mainly

00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:55,900
this you have some for statements you

00:33:51,370 --> 00:33:57,520
have some things to to do there is a

00:33:55,900 --> 00:34:00,039
main thing that you need to understand

00:33:57,520 --> 00:34:03,340
which are the curly brackets with the

00:34:00,039 --> 00:34:05,789
person sign which saying I'm going to do

00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:10,919
something as you may see

00:34:05,789 --> 00:34:14,250
here as i have here the curly bracket %

00:34:10,919 --> 00:34:17,960
I'm just saying okay you are going to do

00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:20,700
something extend from a parent okay then

00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:23,099
with the block i'm saying okay you are

00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:26,369
going to take this blog and override it

00:34:23,099 --> 00:34:28,829
and so on the double curly bracket here

00:34:26,369 --> 00:34:32,099
is just saying i'm going to display

00:34:28,829 --> 00:34:33,809
something okay and of course this viable

00:34:32,099 --> 00:34:39,929
is not coming from know where it's

00:34:33,809 --> 00:34:45,750
coming from the controller ok so in

00:34:39,929 --> 00:34:49,169
drupal you have three main things to do

00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:51,659
yeah the first one is the weather that

00:34:49,169 --> 00:34:56,220
module I don't know if in Drupal 7 you

00:34:51,659 --> 00:34:58,500
had this but in there you have to know

00:34:56,220 --> 00:35:03,150
that you have to implement some things

00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:05,069
called hook you know that of course and

00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:06,599
in there you have just to say okay what

00:35:05,069 --> 00:35:10,230
is the name of the template i'm going to

00:35:06,599 --> 00:35:14,339
use for the controller for the

00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:16,500
controller i'm using actually yeah it's

00:35:14,339 --> 00:35:19,799
not the controller is the theme so the

00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:22,829
key forecasts is basically took from

00:35:19,799 --> 00:35:26,160
this time i'm in the controller and i

00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:31,440
have the hashtag theme and it's the same

00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:35,910
name as the the key i had in my array

00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:38,849
right there okay then i create my

00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:41,220
template and that's it it works ok

00:35:38,849 --> 00:35:43,920
that's why i'm saying there are three

00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:47,220
steps because yeah of course in here you

00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:49,410
can see that the name of the template is

00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:52,530
of course forecasts because that's well

00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:59,880
that's what I told to the hook right

00:35:52,530 --> 00:36:05,910
here ok there is documentation of course

00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:08,790
so feel free to go there there is a when

00:36:05,910 --> 00:36:10,710
I began with Drupal 8 was very difficult

00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:14,400
because the documentation is always on

00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:15,450
under construction sometimes it works

00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:18,260
sometimes it doesn't

00:36:15,450 --> 00:36:20,670
so yeah try it out it's a way of

00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:26,340
contributing to drupal and make sure

00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:28,170
that it will go out one day but yeah in

00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:30,270
the twig that centralized dot org you

00:36:28,170 --> 00:36:33,930
will see all the documentation about

00:36:30,270 --> 00:36:36,480
twig and you have to know that whole

00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:39,570
functionality of twig is not used by

00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:43,770
drupal okay so you just have to try it

00:36:39,570 --> 00:36:45,870
and see and that's it for me if you need

00:36:43,770 --> 00:36:49,200
