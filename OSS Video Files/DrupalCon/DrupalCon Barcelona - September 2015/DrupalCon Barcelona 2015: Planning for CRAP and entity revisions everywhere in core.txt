Title: DrupalCon Barcelona 2015: Planning for CRAP and entity revisions everywhere in core
Publication date: 2015-09-22
Playlist: DrupalCon Barcelona - September 2015
Description: 
	This is a follow-up on the core conversations in Los Angeles that recived lots of positive feedback when suggesting improvements to the Entity Revision API in core.

In this session we will lay out a more concrete and detailed plan of how we can introduce these improvements in Drupal 8.2.x or 9.x.

Short background on the topic

CRAP stands for Create Read Archive Purge which implies that all changes to an entity creates a new revision, even a delete operation is a new revision (much like Git does it). This creates a system much more capable of managing complex workflows, concurrent editing, distributed content, content staging, audit trails etc.
