Title: DrupalCon Barcelona 2015: Reverse Engineering People
Publication date: 2015-09-22
Playlist: DrupalCon Barcelona - September 2015
Description: 
	From designers, to DevOps, to your favourite personality-driven work-place scandal, there are a lot of people talking about empathy and why it's so important at work. Perhaps you think it's a waste of time; or maybe you think it's important, but you don't really understand how to apply the technique professionally.

Usually when we say the word "empathy" there's an underlying "woo-woo let's talk feelings" undertone, but it's also a tool you can use to understand what motivates your team; to spot blockers before they become a problem; and to get a "health check" on the projects you oversee. Sounds useful when you read it from that definition, doesn't it.

This session will be broken into three parts:

Level 1: "Caring just enough." The basic human skills you know about, and use, outside of work. This section is most relevant to team members who want to promote a healthy workplace culture.
Level 2: "Thinking strategies." Using your team’s motivators to help them succeed. This section will be most useful to those who manage people and team leads.
Level 3: "Imagination." Learning to complain from the other person’s perspective. This section will be most useful to those who manage people and team leads.
Even if you still aren't comfortable with the "e" word by the end of this talk, you will have a better grasp on how to apply work-place appropriate, tangible techniques to produce higher functioning, happier teams.

	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,650
so good morning everyone congratulations

00:00:03,419 --> 00:00:07,440
to those of you who are able to

00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:09,150
accomplish coffee this morning for those

00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,070
of you who weren't able to manage coffee

00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:14,639
this morning may you be first in line at

00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:15,990
lunch for the beverage lineup um today

00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:18,420
I'm going to be giving a presentation

00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:21,539
that I've given a couple of times and

00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:24,510
the slides are already uploaded for you

00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:26,550
and this session is being recorded and

00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:28,830
it's also been recorded previously

00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:31,410
should there be any kind of failure with

00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:33,840
the recording so with that sort of in

00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:39,360
mind I will be delightful and charming

00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:41,100
for the next 57 minutes and I'm happy to

00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,300
do a QA as well but if you found that

00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,340
there was another session that you were

00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:46,050
also interested in seeing I will not in

00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:48,059
the slightest be offended if you sneak

00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:50,190
out and go to that other session because

00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:54,020
I want you to be getting best value for

00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:57,480
your entire drupalcon experience so this

00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:59,879
presentation is I it's I mean it's a

00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:02,520
great title but if I'm being perfectly

00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:04,290
honest it's not really what this title

00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:07,560
for this presentation is called and

00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:09,960
really this presentation is called

00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:11,880
something to the effect of a primer on

00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:14,640
how I learned to be a more empathetic

00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:17,820
person in the workplace and I don't have

00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:20,610
that sort of caveat on that slide but as

00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:22,710
we see throughout the presentation this

00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:25,350
is a this is a skill that can be

00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:26,820
developed and it can be used or not used

00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:30,030
and it wasn't a skill that I was

00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:35,340
comfortable using in the workplace for

00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:37,860
various reasons so the gist of what I'm

00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:39,960
going to say is going to kind of end up

00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:42,630
feeling a little bit touchy touchy feely

00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:45,299
woo woo but in the best possible way and

00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:48,119
a lot of it the presentations that I've

00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:50,549
seen where and especially around DevOps

00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:52,890
and use your research they talked about

00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:54,950
how important empathy is but they don't

00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:57,479
go on to actually give you the how to

00:01:54,950 --> 00:02:01,100
empathy and so this presentation I'm

00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:03,810
hoping will give people a bit more and

00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:05,579
more either vocabulary to discuss with

00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:08,729
other people in terms of your co-workers

00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:11,700
and getting empathy to be a tool in your

00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:13,379
tool kit at work or perhaps the actual

00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,860
steps that you need to use yourself to

00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:15,960
be a more

00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:17,130
pathetic person in the workplace while

00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:23,580
still maintaining really healthy

00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:27,810
boundaries one of the things that temple

00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:29,580
grandin is a biology researcher I think

00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:32,730
is the best way to describe her also

00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:38,580
with Asperger's I think is the right

00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:40,890
definition of her diagnosis condition

00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:42,930
and and what she has discovered or what

00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:45,450
she will say about people is that we

00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:47,610
have an incredible lack of empathy and

00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:50,240
it is again a skill that needs to be

00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:52,530
practiced so one of the things that I

00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:54,780
did a couple of years ago was a

00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:57,800
leadership training program and I had

00:02:54,780 --> 00:03:00,440
always considered myself someone to be

00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:04,800
relatively empathetic but also

00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:07,350
relatively self-aware and I'm able to

00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:10,080
understand that just because I had seen

00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:12,420
a movie on the big screen about topic

00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,400
whatever that suddenly didn't make me

00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:16,680
able to experience the conditions that

00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,720
were depicted in that movie in real life

00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:21,510
and so I've been fairly cautious about

00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:23,130
saying yes i can put myself in someone

00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:25,049
else's shoes yes i can experience

00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:27,150
something through someone else and so I

00:03:25,049 --> 00:03:29,820
took this Leadership Program and one of

00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:33,530
the things that was a key part of the

00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:35,670
leadership program was the skills

00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:38,010
assessment and it showed us our

00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:39,420
preferences of where we liked or what

00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:41,519
skills we like to use in the workplace

00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:43,620
they were all thinking strategy so

00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:47,100
there's 18 thinking strategies I'll talk

00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:50,610
a lot about them later on but one of the

00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:52,350
things that I came to realize is that

00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:54,959
actually I was not quite as empathetic

00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:56,880
as I thought in the workplace and when I

00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:58,230
say not quite as empathetic as I thought

00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:00,120
for those of you who aren't able to

00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:03,810
perceive or see the graphic on the

00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:06,600
screen I scored a zero for empathy and

00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:08,970
it's one of those binary question

00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:10,590
surveys where if you score high in

00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:13,010
something you have to score low in

00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:15,660
something else so given the choice of

00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:18,329
whatever the two things were I would

00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:20,700
always choose the non empathetic answer

00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:22,620
as what I would prefer to do in the

00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:24,120
workplace and for me some of those

00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:27,200
questions were just structured in a way

00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:29,840
that I felt I wasn't able

00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:31,670
you accomplish the tasks so did I really

00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,290
truly feel like I could perceive a

00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:35,450
problem from someone else's point of

00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:38,330
view and I I just didn't think I could

00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:40,070
because I didn't think that being Who I

00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:42,410
am as a person in terms of my upbringing

00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:44,120
my background the color of my skin my

00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:46,400
gender all of those things I couldn't

00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:49,130
pretend to be someone else with a great

00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,810
deal of accuracy and so every time one

00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:53,600
of those empathy questions came up I

00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:56,120
would just say no I just can't do thy or

00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,860
at least I can't do it with the casual

00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:00,500
nature which you have suggested is

00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:03,560
possible in the workplace so as a result

00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:05,510
of this course I had to decide is this a

00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:06,950
skill that I want to try and develop or

00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:09,440
is this something that I'm comfortable

00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:10,550
just continuing to say no I'm going to

00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,310
leave that for outside the workplace

00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:14,720
where I actually have the capacity to be

00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:17,210
empathetic with my friends and my

00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:20,270
family's and with people who are around

00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:23,690
me in a day-to-day situation this talk

00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:26,180
is sort of my mind realization that it

00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:27,560
was a skill that I could bring into the

00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:30,560
workplace and that I could nurture and I

00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:32,990
could develop if I so choose so the

00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,970
first thing I want to kind of double

00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:38,150
check with you is is the definition of

00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:39,800
empathy versus sympathy empathy is as I

00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:41,150
have said many times already and will

00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:44,120
continue to say during this presentation

00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:47,120
it is that ability to get yourself in

00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:50,150
someone else's situation later in the

00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:52,040
presentation i'll talk about essentially

00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:54,110
empathy practitioners and user

00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:57,590
researchers and DevOps and people who

00:05:54,110 --> 00:06:01,610
it's their job to get inside what the

00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:05,840
experience is is a user or as a person

00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:08,960
using software so understand and share

00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:10,760
is different from having pity for

00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:13,640
someone so when I'm talking about

00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:17,300
empathy in this the first sort of like

00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:18,830
stage 1 or level one scenario I'm kind

00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:21,290
of really talking about sympathy and

00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:23,360
that's that ability to safely leave

00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:25,280
yourself detached from someone else and

00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:28,340
say oh I'm sorry that the sucks for you

00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:30,140
and and that sort of disengagement but

00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:33,020
acknowledgment that there's a problem at

00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:35,210
Donna's presentation which is later in

00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:36,890
this week Catholic Rob is she adds a

00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:39,140
third dimension to this and talks about

00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:40,710
compassion so if this topic is of

00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:43,440
interest to you or you want to send

00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:46,140
your friends and co-workers to a similar

00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:47,730
session I think she does a nice job of

00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:49,470
going one step deeper in terms of

00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:53,090
looking at a framework it's less of a

00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:55,350
how-to but a nice follow-up to this one

00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:57,120
so today we'll be talking about empathy

00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:58,620
from three different levels and I sort

00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,600
of thinking this as a non-gamer

00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:03,660
apparently you level up and move from

00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:05,970
one thing to another so I like to think

00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:07,770
of this as being you know that the first

00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:09,450
level everyone should be able to

00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:11,550
accomplish this first level by the end

00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:15,030
of this presentation the second level is

00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:16,650
choosing a framework and and I'm going

00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:19,440
to speak about one specific framework

00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:21,470
but you could you could adopt any number

00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:24,770
of frameworks and and thinking about

00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:27,270
structuring and experience from a

00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:28,800
framework that has whether it's

00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:30,990
pseudoscience or actual science

00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,550
background of how people are going to

00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:34,620
perceive the world and interact with the

00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:36,690
world but thinking about selecting a

00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:39,960
framework and using it and getting your

00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:41,460
team on board with that framework so

00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:43,530
that you have some common language and

00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:46,770
then the third one is sort of the the

00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:49,830
empathy practitioner or the the level

00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:51,030
three difficulty I don't expect everyone

00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:53,430
to be able to walk out of this

00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:54,840
presentation able to be an empathy

00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:57,020
practitioner in terms of a user

00:07:54,840 --> 00:08:00,480
researcher or an anthropologist or

00:07:57,020 --> 00:08:03,270
however you think or whatever roles you

00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:05,670
think of as being that's their job to

00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:08,700
understand and someone else's experience

00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:10,560
and then to make it smoother but that's

00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:14,820
level three that's that's the height of

00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:19,070
what we can get to the first one level

00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:21,660
one is caring just enough and this is

00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:24,660
this is sort of the the point at which

00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:26,580
you if you speak in human resources

00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:28,980
speak you stop thinking of people as

00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:32,190
resources and you start thinking them of

00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:34,920
people as actually people with stories

00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:37,140
and experiences and someone who didn't

00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:38,580
get any sleep last night because the

00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:39,810
baby was up someone who can get any

00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:42,210
sleep last night because they were of

00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:44,970
drinking may have the same result at 9am

00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:48,420
but it is a different experience that

00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:52,020
they are coming from so this is this is

00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:54,450
beginner level stuff I think and the the

00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:56,790
ultimate and sort of take away on

00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:58,320
this one is to stop compartmentalizing

00:08:56,790 --> 00:09:00,990
and that was something that I tended to

00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,760
do at work and say work is work I'm

00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:04,170
going to put my professional face on and

00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:06,240
I'm going to expect professional

00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:08,670
behavior from my co-workers at all times

00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:12,360
i'm going to have a very low tolerance

00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:14,160
for behaviors that I feel are not

00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:16,470
appropriate to the workplace and then

00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:19,230
five o'clock or whenever that sort of

00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:20,610
bell goes off at the end of the day we

00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:22,170
all get to let our hair down we all get

00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:24,720
to be as inappropriate as we want to be

00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:29,580
an inappropriate stays outside of work

00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:32,610
and and also work stays in work and

00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:34,260
doesn't sort of blend over as members of

00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:36,390
an open source community you are

00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:37,770
probably aware that the lines get kind

00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:39,420
of fuzzy and so that

00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:42,120
compartmentalization can be incredibly

00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:44,760
difficult and so starting to to relate

00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:46,230
to the people who are in this room who

00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:49,290
are your co-workers who are your fellow

00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:51,570
contributors as people is something that

00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:54,420
I think we need to do more of so the

00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:55,800
risks and rewards I only have to say

00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:59,730
that three times in this presentation

00:09:55,800 --> 00:10:01,980
the risks and rewards are pretty simple

00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:05,340
it takes a little bit of time investment

00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:08,100
and ultimately the win on this is that

00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:11,280
you're going to improve team cohesion so

00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:12,660
pretty straightforward stuff so far so

00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:15,330
how do we do this again this is a

00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:17,550
practical session in terms of how do we

00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:19,620
actually engage in empathy and

00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:21,660
ultimately all we need to do at this

00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:23,640
point is to collect stories from people

00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:25,200
so you need to ask them questions and

00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:27,990
you need to listen to the answers and

00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:32,450
when I say listen to the answers I mean

00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:34,980
stop and listen to the answers so the M

00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:38,250
acronym maybe something that you want to

00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:40,020
look up STFU I'm not actually going to

00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:41,790
say that as part of my presentation but

00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:45,870
i encourage you to google if you don't

00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:48,060
know what STFU stands for but the the

00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:49,950
key here is the listening part of

00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:51,840
empathy and one of the things that I

00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:54,750
find quite difficult is what I'm hearing

00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:56,910
someone's experience about something my

00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:59,550
immediate tendency is to jump in with my

00:10:56,910 --> 00:11:03,240
own equivalent experience and that's

00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:05,940
almost denying that person's story

00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:07,379
because it's it's it's changing the

00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:09,059
focus toward me

00:11:07,379 --> 00:11:11,789
all I'm trying to do is make connections

00:11:09,059 --> 00:11:13,529
and certainly as an as a professional

00:11:11,789 --> 00:11:15,899
teacher I am constantly thinking about

00:11:13,529 --> 00:11:17,129
how can i how can I make a bridge for

00:11:15,899 --> 00:11:19,529
this learner how can I make that

00:11:17,129 --> 00:11:21,329
connection a little bit more obvious but

00:11:19,529 --> 00:11:23,369
that's not what that's what we do when

00:11:21,329 --> 00:11:25,679
we're practicing empathy and empathy we

00:11:23,369 --> 00:11:27,989
stop we listen we receive the

00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:30,929
information and then we ask questions

00:11:27,989 --> 00:11:34,979
and maybe at some point we'll start sort

00:11:30,929 --> 00:11:36,869
of clarifying or you know in when this

00:11:34,979 --> 00:11:39,029
happened to me I found this can you

00:11:36,869 --> 00:11:41,159
describe to me how this is different or

00:11:39,029 --> 00:11:43,199
how it's the same but it's used as a

00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:46,049
point of clarification not as a way to

00:11:43,199 --> 00:11:48,019
change the story into or change the

00:11:46,049 --> 00:11:53,099
situation into something about yourself

00:11:48,019 --> 00:11:55,979
and then the next part of empathy in

00:11:53,099 --> 00:11:57,929
this sort of practical sense of the word

00:11:55,979 --> 00:11:59,519
is to refer back to those stories so a

00:11:57,929 --> 00:12:02,009
week later a month later a year later

00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:04,169
stay back to someone you had told me

00:12:02,009 --> 00:12:06,539
this thing how is it going is that has

00:12:04,169 --> 00:12:08,579
it improved is it as it have you

00:12:06,539 --> 00:12:10,229
resolved the issue are you still

00:12:08,579 --> 00:12:13,919
enjoying your job as much as you were

00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:16,799
those those connections allow the person

00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:18,359
to to give you more information and to

00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:20,069
feel that they were important and to

00:12:18,359 --> 00:12:23,459
feel that they had something to share

00:12:20,069 --> 00:12:25,709
with you but it also reminds you that a

00:12:23,459 --> 00:12:27,089
story is not an isolated incident it's

00:12:25,709 --> 00:12:29,189
something that's going to continue for

00:12:27,089 --> 00:12:30,809
that particular person so if you want to

00:12:29,189 --> 00:12:32,519
be able to place yourself in that

00:12:30,809 --> 00:12:34,139
person's shoes to be to be able to

00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:35,579
experience their life you have to

00:12:34,139 --> 00:12:37,470
remember that their life does go on and

00:12:35,579 --> 00:12:40,769
refer back to that story that they've

00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:43,619
told you about pretty simple stuff I

00:12:40,769 --> 00:12:45,809
think so next we move into level 2 and

00:12:43,619 --> 00:12:47,939
this is sort of the framework section

00:12:45,809 --> 00:12:49,799
you can swap out your own system I don't

00:12:47,939 --> 00:12:51,509
really care which system you use this is

00:12:49,799 --> 00:12:59,880
the one that I have the most familiarity

00:12:51,509 --> 00:13:04,390
with and it and it

00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:06,490
and my quote here is because I genuinely

00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:08,800
don't care which this to me use but I do

00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:10,960
really really like this one and the

00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:13,990
reason why I like it is it it doesn't

00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:15,790
say I'm a bad person for not using

00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:18,220
empathy in the workplace it says I'm

00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:20,650
really good at something else and I have

00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:24,490
to make a conscious decision to engage

00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:27,580
in some behaviors or thinking strategies

00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:31,150
is what they call them so the rewards

00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:34,150
and risks for this particular one is

00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:36,760
that we can engineer successful outcomes

00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:38,680
now if I look down on the bottom section

00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:41,380
you can see that engineering successful

00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:43,600
outcomes can sometimes be interpreted as

00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:46,060
manipulative so you need to be careful

00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,560
as you use your frameworks to make sure

00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:49,150
that they're done in a respectful way

00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:52,240
that they're done in a transparent way

00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:55,510
and that it is moving everyone forward

00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:57,460
that it's not simply you choosing to

00:13:55,510 --> 00:14:00,850
present one version of yourself to one

00:13:57,460 --> 00:14:03,160
person and another person gets a

00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:05,620
completely different version and you are

00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:08,020
not able to give a cohesive experience

00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:10,630
for your team like this is a form right

00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:13,750
that's going to help open communication

00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:17,290
words that you can use across the entire

00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:20,140
team experience and I think it does help

00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:22,690
to improve diverse thinking as well my

00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:25,270
example on this I'm a lousy brainstorm

00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:27,520
so I if I know I need to brainstorm a

00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:29,230
problem then I can go and look for

00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:31,570
someone who has identified that they

00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:34,120
love to brainstorm and have them puzzle

00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:38,260
through a problem with me i'm i'm more

00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:39,880
of a do a lot of research and sit for a

00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:41,830
week or sit for a month and then

00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:43,750
suddenly the answer comes to me in the

00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:45,700
shower but i'm not a doodler i'm not i

00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:47,830
can't muscle through i can't force out

00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:49,690
the ideas in the way that someone who

00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:52,270
can whiteboard a problem can sort of

00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:53,770
work to a natural conclusion so those

00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:56,160
different strategies are things that we

00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:59,890
can take advantage of I know that I'm

00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:01,960
still you know I'm still developing my

00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:03,700
empathy muscle shall we say so if

00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:05,740
there's other people in my team who I

00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:07,120
know are better than me at it then I can

00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:11,710
talk to them and work with them and help

00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:12,880
get them to help me work that muscle it

00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:15,070
allows you to uncover mo

00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:16,960
Vader's as well so now that you know

00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:18,730
that I'm not but I'm someone who

00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:21,040
consciously practices empathy in the

00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:22,480
workplace when you watch me in a

00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,460
scenario when you watch me in a

00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:26,020
situation you may be able to see some of

00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:28,480
those behaviors and you may be able to

00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:30,220
spot where i'm using my preferences or

00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,990
where I'm working a little bit harder

00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:34,330
because I'm trying to practice something

00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:36,730
new and as you work with your co-workers

00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:39,930
your teammates if you see that someone

00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:43,630
they just seem to have no patience

00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:44,620
absolutely never you know they always

00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:46,060
want to get to the end of the

00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:47,380
conversation they just want the

00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:49,270
conclusion they just want to move on

00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:52,060
this is someone who's a fantastic

00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:55,150
decision maker and allowing them to

00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:56,620
experience a brain Starmer in full-on

00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:58,750
mode you're going to end up with

00:15:56,620 --> 00:16:00,160
conflict really quickly so figuring out

00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:02,020
how to unpack those motivators and

00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:05,380
saying to someone I know that you love

00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:07,540
brainstorming bye we're gonna we're

00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:09,520
going to make a decision now and being

00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:12,430
able to sort of help people unpack their

00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:14,410
preferences can make for a smoother

00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:15,940
experience or in other words think about

00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:18,490
what would so and so do in a scenario

00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:20,530
and then make or construct a scenario

00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:23,730
that's going to work for them so I

00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:27,730
mentioned a few different empathy being

00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:29,740
one of those thinking strategies 18

00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:32,440
thinking strategies again this is the 40

00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:34,120
I system use true colors or myers-briggs

00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:35,770
or any of the different systems that

00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:39,490
work for you this one works for me and

00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:42,280
we have on the far left the go or

00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:43,450
generate thinking strategies and I'll go

00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:46,740
into each of these in a little more

00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:50,260
depth and then we have the slowdown

00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:53,500
thinking strategies which are to sort to

00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:55,720
and sort of relate to someone they

00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:57,760
aren't generating new ideas they're

00:16:55,720 --> 00:17:00,250
simply gathering and sorting or sorry

00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:02,290
sorting the information and then finally

00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:04,300
we have this stop and those are the the

00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:06,220
people who are great at making decisions

00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:08,709
they rely on their gut they're not

00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:15,160
really sure why something but they just

00:17:08,709 --> 00:17:17,800
happen to know it so here we go here

00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:21,939
this is the further breakdown this is

00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:24,970
the actual 40 I three dimensions seven

00:17:21,939 --> 00:17:25,929
mindsets and 18 success strategies as

00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:28,389
they

00:17:25,929 --> 00:17:30,909
systems do tend to love their language

00:17:28,389 --> 00:17:34,059
on things so here we go with more

00:17:30,909 --> 00:17:37,049
specifically the creative thinking and

00:17:34,059 --> 00:17:41,230
here we have challenged envision

00:17:37,049 --> 00:17:44,139
brainstorm reframe flash of insight and

00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:46,059
flow I love reframing problems i'm great

00:17:44,139 --> 00:17:48,100
at the pivot i'm great at taking what's

00:17:46,059 --> 00:17:49,570
my scenario here and moving a little bit

00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:51,549
in one direction or a little bit in

00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:53,799
another direction in terms of the

00:17:51,549 --> 00:17:56,409
envision or the long-term visioning of

00:17:53,799 --> 00:17:58,240
something I'm not great at thinking what

00:17:56,409 --> 00:18:00,460
something could be five years out I

00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:03,999
don't know if any of you saw Reese's

00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:05,980
presentation in drupalcon Austin where

00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:07,990
he was looking at sort of the history of

00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:10,059
photography and he was also talking

00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:13,830
about retail sales but for me there was

00:18:10,059 --> 00:18:16,090
a lot of far-reaching thinking of future

00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:18,549
there's a term for this what were the

00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:23,799
future thinkers so you would know this

00:18:18,549 --> 00:18:26,590
word future forecasters thank you so

00:18:23,799 --> 00:18:29,139
that that far away thinking it's not

00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:30,970
something that I I'm not a science

00:18:29,139 --> 00:18:32,649
fiction reader either so for me that

00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:34,629
one's that's a tricky one but you may be

00:18:32,649 --> 00:18:35,860
going over that but that's fun to think

00:18:34,629 --> 00:18:38,499
about the future it's fun to think about

00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:41,879
science fiction so those are different

00:18:38,499 --> 00:18:45,190
things that fall into creative thinking

00:18:41,879 --> 00:18:47,470
phrasing wise if you hear these phrases

00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:49,840
a lot from certain people they may be a

00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:53,110
green or creative thinker or have strong

00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:56,169
preferences for that can we try I know

00:18:53,110 --> 00:19:00,249
we're done but what about oh my goodness

00:18:56,169 --> 00:19:03,820
I just had this great idea so why do you

00:19:00,249 --> 00:19:05,889
think and is this the best we can do so

00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:07,269
all of those are sort of opening up that

00:19:05,889 --> 00:19:08,980
person who you thought you got to a

00:19:07,269 --> 00:19:12,580
conclusion and then they open another

00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:13,990
idea they're probably that it's just

00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:17,740
where they feel most comfortable in

00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:19,350
terms of the preferred strategy so now

00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:22,570
let's take a look at understanding or

00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:25,679
the yellow thinking in terms of slow

00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:30,490
down and here we have scan structure

00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:31,600
clarify tune in empathize and Express so

00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:33,909
half of these are dealing with

00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:36,159
information and half of them okay not

00:19:33,909 --> 00:19:38,720
quite half two-thirds one-third and

00:19:36,159 --> 00:19:42,320
two-thirds are dealing more with

00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:46,250
human dimension of information and I

00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:48,230
tend on any given day if I am forced to

00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:51,169
make a decision in that binary question

00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:53,360
scenario I feel much safer on the data

00:19:51,169 --> 00:19:56,750
side of things the information side of

00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:58,520
things the not gooey fleshy human side

00:19:56,750 --> 00:20:00,380
of things and there are other people who

00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:01,610
will be the exact opposite so for me

00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:05,299
that's a skill that I need to practice

00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:06,890
um I random anecdote almost applied to

00:20:05,299 --> 00:20:08,360
be a librarian which may tell you

00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:11,870
something as well about how much I love

00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:16,159
to sort piles of information and so my

00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:18,230
key phrases on this side so what you're

00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:20,270
saying is that that clarification that

00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:21,080
person who constantly you just said

00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:22,789
something and then they're going to

00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:24,890
repeat exactly what you just said that's

00:20:22,789 --> 00:20:27,650
me because I'm clarifying that I've

00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:30,020
understood what you've said just to

00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:32,539
clarify and so I think this is related

00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:34,549
to so I've made this spreadsheet are

00:20:32,539 --> 00:20:36,860
there is anyone in the room guilty of

00:20:34,549 --> 00:20:42,559
this one come on project managers I know

00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:44,240
you're out there yeah and then that must

00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:48,440
feel horrible so that's the person who

00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:50,510
has that empathy preference finally we

00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:52,520
have the decision makers or the stop

00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:55,039
thinking the red thinking if we're going

00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:56,600
in traffic light colors and at this

00:20:55,039 --> 00:21:03,169
point we're breaking things down into

00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:06,320
and value driven decisions and critical

00:21:03,169 --> 00:21:07,940
decisions or critical critical thinking

00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:10,309
decisions so we have getting to the crux

00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:14,210
of the problem validating a problem

00:21:10,309 --> 00:21:17,270
using your experience concluding gut

00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:20,570
instinct and values driven some of the

00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:22,940
key phrases here I'm ready to move on so

00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:24,919
someone who is just always in that stop

00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:27,530
mode and they don't want to talk about

00:21:24,919 --> 00:21:32,030
things anymore I don't know why I think

00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:33,710
this but someone who is going backwards

00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:37,280
in time in terms of their experience

00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:39,919
last time we tried this the real problem

00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:43,220
is getting to the crux of the problem

00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:46,780
and my gut tells me so again someone who

00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:49,850
is using this language a fair amount

00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:53,350
probably is simply showing a preference

00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:53,350
for that decision based thinking

00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:59,210
so we can structure our meetings we can

00:21:57,049 --> 00:22:01,159
structure our interactions in a way that

00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:02,630
says we're going to brainstorm for 20

00:22:01,159 --> 00:22:05,179
minutes and then we're going to make a

00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:07,220
decision and allowing those preferences

00:22:05,179 --> 00:22:08,929
to be identified or allowing those

00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:11,510
skills to be identified ahead of time

00:22:08,929 --> 00:22:13,279
means that someone who's participating

00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:14,659
in the experience can say well this is

00:22:13,279 --> 00:22:16,130
going to suck but it's only going to

00:22:14,659 --> 00:22:18,230
suck for 20 minutes and then imma be

00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:20,299
able to make a decision so how can you

00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:22,549
shape that experience so that people

00:22:20,299 --> 00:22:25,279
know what skills to bring to the table

00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:28,909
and they know when they need to set

00:22:25,279 --> 00:22:36,289
their preferences aside to use one of

00:22:28,909 --> 00:22:37,970
their other strategies this is my

00:22:36,289 --> 00:22:42,140
breakdown from a couple of years ago

00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:43,190
more completely and I'm trying to

00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:45,260
remember the year that i took this i

00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:46,399
think it was if not 2011 than twenty

00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:50,029
twelve so it's a couple of years ago now

00:22:46,399 --> 00:22:51,710
i am a strong believer in for these

00:22:50,029 --> 00:22:53,270
systems if you take them before and

00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:56,240
after coffee you would probably not have

00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:57,679
the same answers on things so I I

00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:01,039
certainly have no problem sharing this

00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:03,380
with you but it's not a complete

00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:05,210
snapshot of who I am today or who I

00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:08,149
would have been after coffee had I done

00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:09,950
this at a different time of day so for

00:23:08,149 --> 00:23:11,510
me some of the interesting things the

00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:13,870
zeros in terms of the brain storm in the

00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:16,789
envision which I mentioned the empathize

00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:19,309
validate and crux as well also quite low

00:23:16,789 --> 00:23:21,529
and then the white scores over on the

00:23:19,309 --> 00:23:23,390
far right-hand side those are sort of

00:23:21,529 --> 00:23:25,580
like your amplifier so how likely you

00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:28,510
are to engage in any one of your

00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:34,070
thinking strategies and that's sort of a

00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:35,419
volume as well so am I strongly going to

00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:38,270
engage in one of these or like ma'am

00:23:35,419 --> 00:23:41,140
kind of kind of meh on things and those

00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:44,330
are a separate set of questions and as

00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:46,880
you can see the analytical thinking the

00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:49,549
information once it's super high because

00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:52,370
I have to have zeros somewhere else I do

00:23:49,549 --> 00:23:54,799
also have those big Peaks so if you take

00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:56,330
that you don't need to do the test to

00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:57,799
start thinking about what are the things

00:23:56,330 --> 00:24:00,139
that you prefer to do what are the

00:23:57,799 --> 00:24:02,840
things that you don't prefer to do and

00:24:00,139 --> 00:24:04,549
and do you want to practice some of the

00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:05,980
things that you would choose not to

00:24:04,549 --> 00:24:10,039
engage in

00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:13,850
finally we get to the level 3 version of

00:24:10,039 --> 00:24:16,159
empathy and this is where I this is a

00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:17,630
really really tricky one for me and the

00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:21,169
reason why is because i think when we

00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:25,519
start to engage at the level 3 if you're

00:24:21,169 --> 00:24:27,710
not a trained anthropologist if you're

00:24:25,519 --> 00:24:29,210
not a trained user researcher and you

00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:31,010
can do your own training you can be

00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:32,809
community trained doesn't need to be

00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:37,340
formal training but if you don't have

00:24:32,809 --> 00:24:38,929
that capacity to and to keep a personal

00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:41,450
distance i think it becomes really easy

00:24:38,929 --> 00:24:43,990
to lose yourself in the problems that

00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:47,630
other people are describing and you can

00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:50,480
you I shouldn't project I have taken on

00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:53,419
more than what I was capable of dealing

00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:56,330
with on some of these problems and when

00:24:53,419 --> 00:24:58,220
I was I will see in a second here when I

00:24:56,330 --> 00:25:01,039
was arguing from the other person's

00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:03,289
position against myself so it's kind of

00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:05,090
like playing devil's advocate but when I

00:25:03,289 --> 00:25:06,919
was arguing from their position and

00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:08,450
thinking about okay why is this being

00:25:06,919 --> 00:25:10,639
brought to me the way it is what does it

00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:13,460
like what is it like for this person to

00:25:10,639 --> 00:25:15,710
experience the problem in this way turns

00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:18,200
out I was not a very nice person to deal

00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:19,519
with from that person's perspective and

00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,690
i thought i was being fair and i thought

00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:22,490
i was being just and i thought

00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:24,529
everything was good but it really made

00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:25,940
me question my own decisions and if

00:25:24,529 --> 00:25:27,830
you're not prepared to question your own

00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:29,630
decisions and if you're not if you don't

00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:33,860
have a support network to go along with

00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:35,529
this this level of engagement can be it

00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:38,840
can be emotionally incredibly difficult

00:25:35,529 --> 00:25:40,750
so so do caution on this one don't just

00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:44,480
don't just jump in and think you can

00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:45,980
think you can excel at it but if we do

00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:48,470
go about it I've got a couple of good

00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:50,809
anecdotes I think for you I think we can

00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:53,840
get truly creative problem-solving at

00:25:50,809 --> 00:25:56,299
this level and you know there are

00:25:53,840 --> 00:26:00,289
reasons why this discipline exists and

00:25:56,299 --> 00:26:02,960
why the the outputs are so important for

00:26:00,289 --> 00:26:06,620
us i think as software developers so

00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:10,010
here we go the first one is to seek to

00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:14,330
understand and this is some sort of

00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:17,059
being the devil's advocate and the

00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:18,650
assumption is that the listener is on

00:26:17,059 --> 00:26:20,540
the side of the complainers

00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:23,360
how do you put yourself into the

00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:26,300
complainers shoes when you are the

00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:29,240
person who's being complained about so

00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:31,700
I'm not great phrasing on this well skip

00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:33,740
ahead to some of my examples here the

00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:37,250
next one is to seek to experience the

00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:40,730
problem so my first anecdote I was

00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:43,390
working in a distributed company lost a

00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:46,220
year ago actually and my account manager

00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:49,820
who was also sort of onboarding me as a

00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:53,120
project manager broke her wrist and as a

00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:55,520
distributed team we did a very large

00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:59,030
percentage of things through type based

00:26:55,520 --> 00:27:02,390
communication so Molly started using

00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:04,010
dictation software and it was new to her

00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:05,390
it wasn't something that she had

00:27:04,010 --> 00:27:07,550
practiced it wasn't something that she'd

00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:10,390
trained her voice on and the results

00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:14,330
were phonetically correct shall we say

00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:16,490
so if you read the dictated email it

00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:18,500
absolutely made sense if you said the

00:27:16,490 --> 00:27:21,440
words out loud and could hear what you

00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:25,100
were saying instead of reading what the

00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:27,050
actual words were and it was delightful

00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:28,250
most of the time except when it wasn't

00:27:27,050 --> 00:27:30,710
when it was really frustrating because

00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:32,510
you couldn't parse out what the

00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:34,460
dictation software was trying to do and

00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:36,410
so what I did in this particular

00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:39,560
scenario is whenever I needed to get a

00:27:36,410 --> 00:27:41,480
written response back I would structure

00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:43,430
the email in a way that she was able to

00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:45,170
respond with yes or no it wasn't

00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:47,690
multiple questions that had multiple

00:27:45,170 --> 00:27:49,370
options in terms of well if I ask it

00:27:47,690 --> 00:27:51,860
this way it's yes but if I ask it that

00:27:49,370 --> 00:27:54,530
way then it's no one way to ask the

00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:56,030
question a really clear an easy way for

00:27:54,530 --> 00:27:58,510
her to be able to give back that

00:27:56,030 --> 00:28:01,700
information to me and it resulted in

00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:03,230
much faster communications much clearer

00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:06,140
answers that a much better way to

00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:08,450
actually have the project proceed so

00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:11,720
that's one example of me thinking about

00:28:08,450 --> 00:28:13,670
what is this like to be in her shoes and

00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:17,810
it wasn't until I'd actually spent time

00:28:13,670 --> 00:28:19,700
as I went for a visit wasn't until I

00:28:17,810 --> 00:28:22,760
actually watched her using the dictation

00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:24,680
software and realized exactly how much

00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:27,410
frustration she was having with this

00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:31,370
software how much swearing was involved

00:28:27,410 --> 00:28:34,700
in using the software and just the

00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:35,750
drain of energy that it was causing that

00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:37,130
I was like you know I can do something

00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:38,420
about this it's not going to take a lot

00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:40,430
of extra effort on my part to

00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:43,520
restructure the email but it wasn't

00:28:40,430 --> 00:28:45,440
until I really watched the experience

00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:47,240
that I was able to put myself into her

00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,980
shoes before that I like I'm going to

00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:50,750
kind of got that it was irritating but I

00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:53,600
didn't I didn't really understand how

00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:56,480
irritating it was the next example that

00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:59,120
I have is again it's a lot of people

00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:00,980
being grumpy in my examples so the next

00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:04,550
example that I have I was working with a

00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:07,730
client who he was a gem like he was

00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:09,500
genuinely fantastic to work with he was

00:29:07,730 --> 00:29:12,350
one of those clients who missed client

00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:16,910
101 on how to be it not very nice client

00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:19,190
and and and was actually engaged he came

00:29:16,910 --> 00:29:21,440
to our daily stand-ups he was just

00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:23,480
wonderful to work with absolutely loved

00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:26,150
him except every two to four weeks he'd

00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:28,460
get really grumpy and it was not clear

00:29:26,150 --> 00:29:31,400
to me why he was getting really grumpy

00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:32,980
so I heard a second time that it

00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:35,510
happened I was like hey you know like

00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:37,250
what's going on because everything was

00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:39,170
good and then things weren't so good

00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:40,400
he's all I have to write into the report

00:29:39,170 --> 00:29:41,750
you guys haven't really done anything

00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:43,070
that I can put in the report but I know

00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:46,250
you're working really hard and I really

00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:48,470
know what to say like oh well why don't

00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:50,480
I just start giving you weekly summaries

00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:53,020
that you can copy and paste into your

00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:55,550
report he's like that will be amazing

00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:57,170
well we were already doing internal

00:29:55,550 --> 00:29:59,540
reporting it wasn't that big of a deal

00:29:57,170 --> 00:30:02,540
to email him the information but I

00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:05,150
didn't I mean I didn't know that he had

00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:06,980
to write reports and as soon as I was

00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:09,380
able to start asking him questions about

00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:11,390
why some you know why was he frustrated

00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:13,370
because I we were doing great I knew it

00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:15,830
had nothing to do with us were you were

00:30:13,370 --> 00:30:18,380
able to get richer information about the

00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:21,410
experience he was having and support

00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:25,130
that experience so those are a couple of

00:30:21,410 --> 00:30:26,840
examples of how understanding someone

00:30:25,130 --> 00:30:31,610
else's position and being able to

00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:34,580
experience our world through their lens

00:30:31,610 --> 00:30:36,530
a couple of easy changes on my side

00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:38,809
resulted in a much better experience for

00:30:36,530 --> 00:30:40,790
everyone so that's the sort of empathy

00:30:38,809 --> 00:30:42,200
practitioner even if you're not I use

00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:44,470
your research or even if you're not an

00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:47,919
anthropologist even if you're not

00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:48,970
I don't know who else is in the room who

00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:50,710
feels that they are a professional

00:30:48,970 --> 00:30:53,440
empathy practitioner and what's your

00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:58,480
role shadow your job title or your role

00:30:53,440 --> 00:31:00,280
name silence no one is an empathy

00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:01,659
practitioner you're all here to learn I

00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:07,169
love it okay now there's no there's a

00:31:01,659 --> 00:31:09,429
couple of hands yep project leader yeah

00:31:07,169 --> 00:31:14,770
my hearing is horrible can you actually

00:31:09,429 --> 00:31:17,679
I people above Bellone on on on the

00:31:14,770 --> 00:31:23,710
sides yes excellent and what other

00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:25,780
titles yeah Vicky use your experience to

00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:27,880
use your research or yeah fantastic any

00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:29,200
other titles that people have where they

00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:37,390
feel like it's their job to be

00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:38,950
empathetic yes delivery manager and UX I

00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:41,679
am repeating as well for the recording

00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:45,570
just for that benefit any other titles

00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:53,549
that folks have account management yes

00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:53,549
yep team lead what were the other ones

00:31:55,960 --> 00:32:05,350
okay yeah it's a part in maintenance yep

00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:07,990
service manager yeah yeah excellent so

00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:11,320
the the thinking process and ultimately

00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:13,060
should be not left to chance we make it

00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:14,620
deliberate we think about how we can

00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:17,790
actually engage with folks and I think

00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:21,610
we can get much stronger outcomes and

00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:22,390
and I know I'm not running fast but I

00:32:21,610 --> 00:32:26,290
know that we're going to have a lot of

00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:28,060
time so I I think I what I'm going to do

00:32:26,290 --> 00:32:31,020
is run through to the end and then what

00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:34,960
we may do is clip off the recording and

00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:36,640
do an unrecorded QA which is sometimes

00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:38,380
nicer for folks to be able to discuss

00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:39,820
issues that they're having without it

00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:43,600
being on the internet for the rest of

00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:46,330
the infinity and so we'll do that and if

00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:47,770
folks want to stick around for it that

00:32:46,330 --> 00:32:52,180
would be great if you don't that's okay

00:32:47,770 --> 00:32:55,660
too so as I said three basic levels in

00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:58,270
our how-to empathy piece the first level

00:32:55,660 --> 00:33:00,700
is to care just enough and in that point

00:32:58,270 --> 00:33:04,810
we're going to talk to people about

00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:06,790
their lives and then listen to whatever

00:33:04,810 --> 00:33:09,010
the experiences that they've had and

00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:11,290
later on refer back to that experience

00:33:09,010 --> 00:33:12,970
level to use a framework I'm happy to

00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:14,260
talk more about the framework that that

00:33:12,970 --> 00:33:16,000
I know best you may know other

00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:18,460
frameworks there's definitely money out

00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:22,090
on the market and then the third one is

00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:24,040
to engage with people from their

00:33:22,090 --> 00:33:28,360
perspective and I think this is the one

00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:30,700
which is the most difficult to it sounds

00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:34,990
straightforward but I think often we end

00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:38,800
up providing sympathy not empathy so

00:33:34,990 --> 00:33:39,940
we're going to aim for empathy starting

00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:41,680
you know that first level really

00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:45,610
probably matches a bit better on to

00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:47,980
sympathy and if you aren't able to just

00:33:45,610 --> 00:33:49,660
stop and listen to the story the second

00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:54,150
one getting understanding and then the

00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:54,150
third one really maps on to true empathy

00:33:54,990 --> 00:34:01,030
am another quote from the late Maya

00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:02,890
Angelou I think we all have empathy we

00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:05,140
may not have the courage to display it

00:34:02,890 --> 00:34:06,790
again it's a muscle it has to be

00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:08,770
practiced it's a skill it has to be

00:34:06,790 --> 00:34:09,820
practiced and developed you can choose

00:34:08,770 --> 00:34:11,620
to use it you can choose

00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:15,670
not to use it but I don't think it's

00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:17,770
something that is um without value and I

00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:20,980
think that there is more and more in the

00:34:17,770 --> 00:34:25,150
tech community which places value on

00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:28,090
empathy than when i first started two

00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:31,810
decades ago it's actually been hmm

00:34:28,090 --> 00:34:33,820
anyways so um but I it's nice that we

00:34:31,810 --> 00:34:36,250
are starting to recognize it as a skill

00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:38,410
that needs to be practiced and not just

00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:40,840
something that gets lip service so that

00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:42,550
as i mentioned slides are up and i'm

00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:43,930
going to remind everyone about the

00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:44,980
sprints really quickly because we've

00:34:43,930 --> 00:34:48,040
been asked to do that you should

00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:50,110
definitely come on Friday even as a non

00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:52,360
technical person one of the hugely

00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:54,640
valuable things that we can get is a

00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:57,160
reading of all of the comments and then

00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:59,530
rewriting the description of what the

00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:02,410
problem currently is so if you've got

00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:03,760
some fairly basic analytical skills in

00:35:02,410 --> 00:35:05,830
terms of being able to decipher a

00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:07,780
conversation and then present back a

00:35:05,830 --> 00:35:09,610
summary of the conversation hugely

00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:12,010
valuable if you are technical as well

00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:15,100
fantastic we can get you set up and but

00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:16,240
that's happening on friday so again my

00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:19,030
slides are already up there's a

00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:21,000
recording there as well and what I'm

00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:23,800
going to do at this point if there's

00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:26,710
questions that you think are relevant to

00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:27,940
a wider audience there's a mic over in

00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:31,240
the corner which means that I don't have

00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:34,510
to repeat your question if there are

00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:35,740
none then what I'm going to do is I'll

00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:39,300
step away from the mics that were not

00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:41,410
recorded for the next bit all right

00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:45,060
fantastic thank you very much everyone

00:35:41,410 --> 00:35:45,060
