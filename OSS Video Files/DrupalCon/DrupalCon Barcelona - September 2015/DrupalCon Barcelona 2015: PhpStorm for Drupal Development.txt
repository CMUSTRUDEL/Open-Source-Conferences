okay I guess it's time for us to start

00:00:01,979 --> 00:00:08,010
its final book which would be lighten

00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:09,690
sessions so we will be free of us

00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:13,440
talking for about 15 minutes and we'll

00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:19,680
be time for Q&A session in the end of

00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:22,920
all the talks well hello my name is Alex

00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:25,109
de Bianca and I'm the project manager

00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:26,310
product manager and development lead of

00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:29,789
phpstorm

00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:34,020
product from JetBrains first I show

00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:36,390
disclaimer not me not many not anyone on

00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:38,129
my team or not only one on my company is

00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:41,010
that what you can call a real world

00:00:38,129 --> 00:00:43,500
pitch P developer we do a speech P every

00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:46,260
version every build every kind of

00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:47,820
features a is added to PHP to PHP tools

00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:51,420
frameworks and all the stuff but we

00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:53,930
don't use them in production we view

00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:56,760
them from point of integration so our

00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:59,910
perspective is kind of specific but the

00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:03,600
whole point of pitch pistol was to bring

00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:05,580
the level of tooling and instrumentation

00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,790
available for general Deportes the ten

00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:11,850
developers which we have back to PHP

00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:16,350
community which many of us can came from

00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:18,900
in our youth ages and so far I can sell

00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:21,150
I can say we have succeeded because we

00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:23,250
have now hundreds of thousands of users

00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:27,080
and how many of us actually have

00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:31,049
actually use phpstorm

00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:33,240
okay well this session will be really

00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:34,860
quick and I will show some highlights

00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:39,150
that I think will be useful both to

00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:40,979
existing users and new users some

00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:43,700
generic stuff some Drupal stuff and

00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:47,880
maybe some cup of advanced tricks

00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:49,710
okay now interesting if you just open

00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:52,619
it's really easy to start with if you

00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:56,100
saw me just go to file open folder and

00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:57,960
start typing your code in he will try to

00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:03,329
be as small as possible suggest you

00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:05,610
something but it's really pays to invest

00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:07,950
some time to get know you to learn

00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:10,229
better so you can actually build up your

00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:11,640
productivity to get know what features

00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:15,110
are available so they become the

00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:15,110
building blocks and you

00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:24,719
be faster more productive think less of

00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:28,400
some processes that are required to not

00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:31,739
not a rate related to development itself

00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:33,510
everybody knows that they think the

00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:36,269
boring thing called tip of the day which

00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:39,420
bothers everyone in every product on

00:02:36,269 --> 00:02:41,639
desktop until now but we have this

00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:45,209
something of opposite the thing is

00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:49,139
called productivity guide and whatever

00:02:45,209 --> 00:02:50,879
have you didn't use phpstorm at all or

00:02:49,139 --> 00:02:53,010
they have it used for a day or for a

00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,780
week or four months i really suggest you

00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:56,939
to go to the help menu and open

00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:59,099
productivity guide and check out what it

00:02:56,939 --> 00:03:02,700
tells you what features have used how

00:02:59,099 --> 00:03:05,669
much and I mean most importantly what

00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:09,120
features haven't you used yet I suggest

00:03:05,669 --> 00:03:10,439
you to try them at least once so maybe

00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,359
you will find something in particular

00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:14,669
all of us have different workforce

00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:20,579
different requirements our minds work

00:03:14,669 --> 00:03:26,370
differently and ID has sets of features

00:03:20,579 --> 00:03:27,540
which fits different workforce this my

00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:29,699
statistic is not really impressive

00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:33,060
because this my debug version so I have

00:03:29,699 --> 00:03:35,370
time it only 140 140 characters in in

00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:38,430
this product in this cup of product but

00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:41,250
if you open my if you look into my home

00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:43,319
environment with Java code this will be

00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:45,569
much more impressive it's it's 70

00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:48,510
minutes of time many minutes of time

00:03:45,569 --> 00:03:53,790
daily and still the rest of also

00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:58,260
features they haven't never used yet so

00:03:53,790 --> 00:04:00,449
this is a lot of loan to for anybody if

00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:03,750
you have if you already use in phpstorm

00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:05,340
or he really used it yet sometimes you

00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:08,189
may fool us because we have a hundred of

00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:11,489
options a hundred of menu items and for

00:04:08,189 --> 00:04:15,930
example this particular Drupal project

00:04:11,489 --> 00:04:18,959
has five thousand files how to or how to

00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:20,549
get around the first thing this most

00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:23,610
important is also an help menu its

00:04:20,549 --> 00:04:26,130
foundation so if you don't know how to

00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:26,880
find something in this product what is

00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:29,190
this shortcut

00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:31,140
on keyboard where T's in the menus so

00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:32,820
you're completely lost but for example

00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:34,980
you don't you hate the light numbers

00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:38,390
they irritate you completely or you want

00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:40,950
them you can quickly find this section

00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:42,570
toggle it right here or go to

00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:44,610
preferences and tweak it to your to

00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:47,640
awaken this work for any actions that

00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:49,830
would also works with synonyms and next

00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:59,820
thing then in settings you can have a

00:04:49,830 --> 00:05:01,500
have it the same the if you work with

00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:03,270
Drupal the one setting you need to if

00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:05,970
should is enabled is enabled a Drupal

00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:08,100
integration right right now we do a

00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:11,780
tuile it is enabled and only triple

00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:11,780
installation path really

00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:16,740
the next thing how to find anything in

00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:19,740
around in your project anywhere I

00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:21,870
particularly don't remember where my

00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:23,430
files are and which folders I always use

00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:26,180
in this charge I start by finding

00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:28,200
typically or some single line class name

00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:32,400
JavaScript variable or anything like

00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:34,860
that if you try to type this here this

00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:38,550
action called social where you can find

00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:40,560
it via find action or just press double

00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:43,580
shift it make it easy across all

00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:47,010
platforms right here you can see both

00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:54,660
files symbols and actions everything in

00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:57,240
the inner product now and you now if you

00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:59,700
have some files open already if you knew

00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:03,710
your broken you may need to find where

00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:03,710
exactly they are in your file tree and

00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:10,260
so you'll have an action called select

00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:12,840
in which will help you to find your

00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:14,850
current file in any of the two windows

00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:16,590
for example you can quickly locate this

00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:21,540
file in projects you to do something

00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:24,210
around it like this well in any of you

00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:26,160
and it we search also always helping you

00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:28,080
if you try something type to something

00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,890
like JavaScript here it will narrow your

00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,410
navigation

00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:33,630
possibilities too much in symbols

00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:36,000
regardless of how many symbols on you

00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:37,830
and if from any of you switch double

00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,350
escape you can quickly jump back to the

00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:43,590
editor to continue typing your code

00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:46,200
now for something for Drupal if I try to

00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:47,850
declare function in this module file

00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:51,480
which names

00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:53,310
looks like Drupal hook will provide you

00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:54,480
the suitable hook names and most

00:06:53,310 --> 00:07:00,540
important they will provide you this

00:06:54,480 --> 00:07:03,590
help for this hook names so you can

00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:06,210
quickly look up what is need to be done

00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:08,760
which parameters are provided under all

00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:11,160
that for the sake of demo I'll just

00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:13,950
complete any of them and you can notice

00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:15,450
there is a special symbol here there is

00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:18,270
a concept in our product called

00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:20,550
a node called I'll go to declaration and

00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:23,190
find usages for example we consider this

00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:25,020
is hook implementation like kind of

00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:29,070
object or etiquette set so you could go

00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:31,890
to go to its parent declaration there is

00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:33,990
two options you can go to its actual

00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:36,000
formal declaration is helping everything

00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:40,260
and you can find where it's actually

00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:42,390
involved but by Drupal framework and

00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:44,490
it's worked for all hooks and everything

00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:47,490
and while you are there you are coding

00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:50,040
new hook you can go to the declaration

00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:52,620
and threaten to get back and look all of

00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:55,170
different implementations across all the

00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:59,880
models how other models are implementing

00:07:55,170 --> 00:08:02,850
this particular hook so you can check it

00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:05,580
out it may be a copy paste some code to

00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:09,800
go to service boilerplate for your own

00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:09,800
code to get your start started quickly

00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:23,940
well next thing while you're looking in

00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:25,050
phpstorm I always use some kind of

00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:26,990
source control for example for this

00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:30,000
project I just download zip file and

00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:31,700
called git init on this folder so all of

00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,140
contents that I got from the web

00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:36,240
immediately is under good source control

00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:38,729
and right now if I change something you

00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:44,250
can see the change markers right on the

00:08:38,729 --> 00:08:45,690
gutter here so you can try to if I

00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:48,840
change something here for example

00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:50,790
formatting or anything you can see the

00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:57,950
changes and everything like that and you

00:08:50,790 --> 00:09:02,790
can navigate to this file in our in your

00:08:57,950 --> 00:09:06,810
changes you so you can review your

00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:08,610
changes in a property view you can

00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:10,680
commit your changes and do all that this

00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:12,420
all tools integrated directly in the

00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:15,900
environment you don't need to switch

00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:17,670
context at all the same way of

00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:20,430
integration is available for all source

00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:23,339
control systems for most important tools

00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:25,200
for example I consider one of my most

00:09:23,339 --> 00:09:30,120
important tools nowadays a virtual

00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:34,230
machine environment like Drupal oh sorry

00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:36,900
vagrant and something like that when

00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:39,150
also there is a kind of lots of noise in

00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:41,790
this in this window you can see some

00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:47,760
markers right here now this is what we

00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:49,830
call code analyzers you can run a

00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:52,020
standalone tool for example like code

00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:54,150
sniffer to have your code checked

00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:56,250
against coding standards but right now

00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:58,920
here you can have it on the fly directly

00:09:56,250 --> 00:10:01,380
in the editor so you see one all the

00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:03,390
vco1 markers with this Adi suggests

00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:06,170
there is something wrong is wrong here

00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:10,050
and I can tell you if you use actually

00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:12,089
open any video code base from from the

00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:13,950
internet like Drupal sources or melanoma

00:10:12,089 --> 00:10:15,960
gentles and fragments or some resources

00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:18,600
and run this whole set of inspection

00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:21,570
from frameworks you will find hundreds

00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:25,580
of real errors not fixed and latest

00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:25,580
version right now yet

00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:32,460
so the you should always there is a rule

00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:34,350
in our company if I commit anything to

00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:37,740
my source control I check that this

00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:40,950
market is green and particular set of

00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:43,080
rules which is working for your project

00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:45,540
for your coding style is completed we

00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:48,120
cable you can go and configure all kinds

00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:50,760
of checks you want it and all run in via

00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:52,980
both in real time and at the moment of

00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:55,500
you then you trying to commit or push in

00:10:52,980 --> 00:11:01,170
the source control so you can have two

00:10:55,500 --> 00:11:03,810
levels of checks and quick things about

00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:05,430
editor and personally is kind of I am

00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:08,130
kind of person this never remembers

00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:11,730
where stuff is but I can remember names

00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:13,950
of stuff for for example this fight was

00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:19,260
quite long but I never use a scroller

00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:22,680
and even I'm jumping around I always use

00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:24,060
a structure pop-up it looks like this

00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:29,970
and I quickly can narrow down my

00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:32,040
selection to any particular method and

00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:34,440
jump around and also these all these

00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:36,120
jumps are certain kind of history my

00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:39,210
creation is like in browser so you can

00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:43,410
quickly jump back to where you go to

00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:46,350
hooks and jump forward any point so and

00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:49,230
also all over the world I have typed in

00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:51,450
the erased then tapped and again is salt

00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:55,400
and thinking called a local history it's

00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:58,230
much more than it is much more than your

00:11:55,400 --> 00:12:00,360
you have in your commits it stores all

00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:02,970
all sets of changes between yoga means

00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:06,780
so you can go in any point of time and

00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:09,240
rescue your coat if he was having some

00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:10,710
kind of good solution like 10 minutes

00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:12,390
ago now but now it time to type it

00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:21,140
something and it could stop at work you

00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:23,970
can roll back well this are the

00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:26,610
highlights that I have for like right

00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:29,030
right now I can I have like three

00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:31,680
minutes for Q&A right now and

00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:34,770
fortunately for us we have a booth

00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:37,080
downstairs so if anyone wants hands-on

00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:38,400
on something more specific like exit

00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:40,890
back which is always paint

00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:43,680
configure or the debase support or some

00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:46,110
specific stuff came to came to a booth

00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:52,070
we glad to give you hands-on tutorial or

00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:52,070
somehow anytime any events now questions

00:12:54,620 --> 00:13:08,070
thank you yeah so question is which is

00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:12,780
the best way to learn shortcuts

00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:15,510
I personally learn them gradually for

00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:18,390
new things which I know that are there

00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:22,350
I use the find action if you if you if

00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:25,880
you use it actually the reason adding on

00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:31,320
some expand selection there is a

00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:34,170
shortcuts displayed right there Indian

00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:35,820
if you go to productivity guide it's

00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:39,360
also includes a selection for each

00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:40,380
feature for each of each one of them so

00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,570
basically showing cuts displayed

00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:44,820
everywhere and the third thing is if you

00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:47,160
want like a systematic approach like the

00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:50,640
table there is a default key map

00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:52,920
reference which will open printable came

00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:56,220
up and we have a plenty of them in our

00:13:52,920 --> 00:14:06,860
booth some came came to us and we'll

00:13:56,220 --> 00:14:06,860
give Gibson to you yeah

00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:22,790
okay yeah then the name is the keyboard

00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:25,610
you should have in this structure so

00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:29,090
this is the same thing which is here

00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:34,700
structure panel and if you try to look

00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:37,820
it up so my current key map its control

00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:40,100
with f12 but it's very different yeah

00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:42,260
let's I'm route down I'm not talking

00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:43,490
shortcuts and talking names and keywords

00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:45,080
because you need to remember something

00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:50,060
which is scalable between Windows and

00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:52,220
Linux for example double shift this is

00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:55,570
you should use if you can to use double

00:14:52,220 --> 00:15:02,930
shift it's like right here

00:14:55,570 --> 00:15:06,470
next question one minute okay thank you

00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:08,450
so welcome to our booth downstairs it's

00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:13,090
number three or something on the corner

00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:13,090
