Title: DrupalCon Barcelona 2015: How to diversify your business beyond Drupal
Publication date: 2015-09-22
Playlist: DrupalCon Barcelona - September 2015
Description: 
	Business success comes with focus. As you grow your company based on one single value proposition, however, you will want to diversify your business beyond Drupal. There is a multitude of reasons: Securing your business, providing a more comprehensive service to your clients, providing your team with new challenges, or maybe just for your own ego.

There are different paths to diversification, from adding services within the company to creating spin-offs from your existing company.

Dania Gerhardt, Co-Founder of Amazee Labs and Amazee Metrics, will present possible market areas, ways to expand, the challenges that come with the new complexity, but mostly: the reasons to do it.

so welcome everybody I think you all

00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:07,950
hear me it sounds pretty loud from here

00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:09,719
in front welcome to my talk about how to

00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:12,150
diversify your web service business

00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:14,040
beyond Drupal my name is daniel gearhart

00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:17,520
and i'm one of the founders of amazing

00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:19,320
labs I can't tell you how to diversify

00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,000
your web service business beyond Drupal

00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,380
that works for you but I'm gonna try and

00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,720
tell you some stories about our personal

00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:26,519
experience because we've done quite a

00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:29,390
bit of diversification in the past few

00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:32,399
years since we started with our company

00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:33,660
so some words about myself so I was born

00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:35,219
and bred in the United States in

00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:37,860
Switzerland I moved to Switzerland when

00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:41,309
I was 7 years old I studied economics in

00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:43,140
Basel then I became a chartered

00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:45,660
accountant so I worked as a manager with

00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:49,530
KPMG in the area of international

00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:51,210
auditing and accounting then I had after

00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:53,100
five years quite a change in my career

00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:53,969
so that's when the amazing story starts

00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:56,730
and that's what I'm going to tell you

00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:58,559
more about later on and another big step

00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:00,570
for myself is what that I moved after

00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:05,580
many years being in Switzerland I moved

00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:07,470
to South Africa last year so 2007 that

00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:09,210
was the end of my old career in the

00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:12,030
start of my new life that was the time

00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:13,979
when Facebook had already taken off so

00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:16,320
people were going online having social

00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:18,000
behavior and my husband Gregory and I

00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,210
started spinning the idea of creating a

00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,590
start-up creating a platform that

00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:24,830
centers around civic and social action

00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:28,170
that allows people to collaborate online

00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:30,119
to build projects around common ideas

00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:33,150
and achieve goals with fundraising tool

00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:35,040
publication tools lots of features and

00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:37,259
functions and at the end that ended up

00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:40,950
that we built that platform around or on

00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:43,920
Drupal so we kicked off our startup we

00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:46,350
quit our jobs 2007 both of us we found

00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,090
at our company 2008 we went to Silicon

00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:50,420
Valley we had interviews with tech

00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:52,979
bloggers got quite some media attention

00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:55,590
had lots of fun we're really in this web

00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:59,009
startup groove we launched our platform

00:01:55,590 --> 00:02:01,380
called amaze ecomme in 2008 first alpha

00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:06,450
then a bentzi those were really good

00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:08,459
times then came 2009 2009 the money was

00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:11,400
slowly going down we had some user

00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:13,540
traction but not really enough and lots

00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,730
of ideas how to further develop our plan

00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:19,510
form and become leading in that space

00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:21,670
but it just didn't happen and that was

00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:24,069
when we had first moments of okay what's

00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:26,980
going to come next the first team member

00:02:24,069 --> 00:02:29,560
left for a proper job away from our

00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:30,819
startup and at the same time we had that

00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:33,010
down moment of not knowing how to

00:02:30,819 --> 00:02:34,959
continue we had some requests from

00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:37,209
corporates if we couldn't do some

00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:39,340
customized work for them if we couldn't

00:02:37,209 --> 00:02:40,750
recreate this platform for them they

00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:43,269
don't want to have their projects on

00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:45,189
amazing calm but they do want to work

00:02:43,269 --> 00:02:47,260
with us and have maybe an own platform

00:02:45,189 --> 00:02:50,620
for for example for a company

00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:53,859
anniversary or to just collaborate

00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:55,930
online internally and so we did three

00:02:53,859 --> 00:02:58,810
white label solutions of amazing calm in

00:02:55,930 --> 00:03:00,879
that time that gave us money gave us

00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:02,319
additional motivation and we did see a

00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:04,030
new vision we saw that it could be

00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:05,739
possible to make something good out of

00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:08,620
what didn't turn out to be so successful

00:03:05,739 --> 00:03:10,959
and so we did more and more customized

00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:12,549
work we did a little bit under the hood

00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:14,379
so there was still this platform amaze

00:03:12,549 --> 00:03:16,209
adult calm where you could log in create

00:03:14,379 --> 00:03:18,310
your project and then there was a footer

00:03:16,209 --> 00:03:19,810
with the very small line saying by the

00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:22,030
way you can call us if you want a

00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:24,430
customized solution but we didn't really

00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:27,669
out ourselves we were still sharing this

00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:32,049
vision of becoming a leader in this web

00:03:27,669 --> 00:03:35,500
platform space with our own product so

00:03:32,049 --> 00:03:36,879
in 2010 we decided we are going to go

00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:38,229
that path we're going to become a web

00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:40,449
service company we're going to outdo

00:03:38,229 --> 00:03:42,519
ourselves as a web agency so away from

00:03:40,449 --> 00:03:45,129
the sexy young web startup to a very

00:03:42,519 --> 00:03:46,989
calm and web service company we did a

00:03:45,129 --> 00:03:50,979
rebranding and we launched in September

00:03:46,989 --> 00:03:52,959
2010 as amazing labs so maisie labs com

00:03:50,979 --> 00:03:56,379
and that was clearly a web service

00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:58,900
company based on building websites on

00:03:56,379 --> 00:04:00,430
Drupal we had huge expertise with our

00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:02,319
platform that we had built in the past

00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:04,419
years and that gave us the kickstart

00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:07,540
then and to be successful in that

00:04:04,419 --> 00:04:09,579
service industry what happened later in

00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:11,919
the next year's is so we've grown quite

00:04:09,579 --> 00:04:13,810
well with amazing with amazing lives

00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:16,840
that was about thirty percent growth per

00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:18,159
year and in 2013 we have had our first

00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:20,049
spin-off we're going to talk more about

00:04:18,159 --> 00:04:22,120
that later that's amazing metrics and

00:04:20,049 --> 00:04:24,889
then we had to geographical spin-offs

00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:27,770
which was 2014 we had an office open

00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:32,030
in austin and texas and 2015 now a few

00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:33,949
months ago in june in cape town so maybe

00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:36,319
back to the topic so why should I

00:04:33,949 --> 00:04:38,539
diversify why should we diversify like

00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:41,289
away from what we all love most which is

00:04:38,539 --> 00:04:43,460
Drupal that's maybe just one perspective

00:04:41,289 --> 00:04:46,249
diversifying away from something that's

00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:49,310
core I mean we might want to just ask

00:04:46,249 --> 00:04:52,189
ourselves like what is our overall

00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:54,319
strategic company goal what do we want

00:04:52,189 --> 00:04:56,419
to stand for we asked ourselves what

00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:58,129
does amazing labs want to stand for what

00:04:56,419 --> 00:05:01,849
does our group want to stand for if we

00:04:58,129 --> 00:05:03,939
continue to grow ours is to become a

00:05:01,849 --> 00:05:07,219
leading global web service provider

00:05:03,939 --> 00:05:08,689
global web service provider that maybe

00:05:07,219 --> 00:05:12,229
also explains why we have to diversify

00:05:08,689 --> 00:05:14,210
beyond Drupal because our strategy and

00:05:12,229 --> 00:05:16,789
our offering can not just only include

00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:19,129
Drupal it's not we're not only perceived

00:05:16,789 --> 00:05:21,500
as a technology provider we build

00:05:19,129 --> 00:05:25,400
websites and provide web services to

00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:27,379
clients so following that strategic goal

00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:28,969
is really important we all know that and

00:05:27,379 --> 00:05:32,900
to succeed in a goal it's crucial to

00:05:28,969 --> 00:05:35,750
just understand where are we now why do

00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:37,849
clients want to work with you now why do

00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:41,629
they book you why do they ask you to

00:05:37,849 --> 00:05:43,580
write a proposal why do they then accept

00:05:41,629 --> 00:05:46,219
your proposal maybe it's because you

00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:47,839
just happen to be the cheapest service

00:05:46,219 --> 00:05:50,210
provider offering for a certain product

00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:53,060
that could be but then they still had a

00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:54,529
reason to ask you in so you do stands

00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:56,689
for something we all do stand for

00:05:54,529 --> 00:05:58,250
something with a reputation and that

00:05:56,689 --> 00:06:00,500
reputation can be a great technical

00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:03,469
capacity it can be being a leading

00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:05,899
Drupal service provider but it can also

00:06:03,469 --> 00:06:08,539
be something else it can be that we try

00:06:05,899 --> 00:06:11,089
to create beautiful websites it could be

00:06:08,539 --> 00:06:13,430
that you have a great team of people

00:06:11,089 --> 00:06:16,550
that people just like working with you

00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:18,139
because you deliver a good service maybe

00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:19,969
it's just general your service

00:06:18,139 --> 00:06:22,310
orientation that stands for you and not

00:06:19,969 --> 00:06:24,710
the technology so only if you understand

00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:26,659
why you win projects you can follow that

00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:28,279
strategy and also make the right

00:06:26,659 --> 00:06:32,300
decisions and where and how to diversify

00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:34,610
and what to focus on so in our case we

00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:36,740
believe or we have seen that about fifty

00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:39,560
percent of our clients

00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:41,240
choose us because of Drupal because we

00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:43,130
are the largest triple shop in

00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:45,620
Switzerland that exclusively does Drupal

00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:47,090
we have lots of experience so about 50%

00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:48,560
scum they know they want a triple

00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:50,720
website that's what they're going to do

00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,400
they're going to ask us in but then we

00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,169
have 50 other % and those are really

00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,599
important otherwise we can't succeed and

00:06:54,169 --> 00:06:58,460
about 30 come because they want a good

00:06:56,599 --> 00:07:00,259
looking website so beautiful web service

00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:02,630
this is something we try to create we

00:07:00,259 --> 00:07:04,220
try to make it look good and twenty

00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:05,900
percent come for other services maybe

00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:07,310
because they've seen a case a special

00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:10,009
solution that we've built a community

00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:12,020
solution or a second-screen solution

00:07:10,009 --> 00:07:13,789
just something special that they've seen

00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:17,630
with another client that they think we

00:07:13,789 --> 00:07:19,009
might have good expertise in so the

00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:20,870
perception of the agency is not fully

00:07:19,009 --> 00:07:22,550
based on technology it's on delivery and

00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:24,380
experience and that's why our

00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:30,169
positioning and our strategy must also

00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:31,490
be quite broad so after having failed

00:07:30,169 --> 00:07:33,740
with our like social collaboration

00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:36,199
platform like maybe on a side note

00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:38,690
amazing calm did continue to exist for a

00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:41,030
while but as per end of 2011 we closed

00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:43,789
that platform and fully focused on the

00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:46,219
web service side with that platform we

00:07:43,789 --> 00:07:48,169
want it to be all to everybody we wanted

00:07:46,219 --> 00:07:49,639
to achieve it all and we've learned

00:07:48,169 --> 00:07:51,530
quite painfully that we have to get a

00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:54,289
few things right to be successful in the

00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:56,479
business and we also often criticize our

00:07:54,289 --> 00:07:58,219
clients for you know creating feature

00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:00,919
creeps and just wanting to do everything

00:07:58,219 --> 00:08:03,889
and putting it all in one release but

00:08:00,919 --> 00:08:05,960
we're all not really immune to adding

00:08:03,889 --> 00:08:07,699
another service offering it's like oh

00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:09,110
could you maybe do this website and

00:08:07,699 --> 00:08:10,430
WordPress you know with one in Drupal

00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:13,340
and WordPress you could go like yeah

00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:15,110
okay or we also need a CEO will you add

00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:17,330
that for us to yes of course not a

00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:19,280
problem we need German translations yes

00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:21,830
we'll organise that for you so I think

00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:24,289
we all see that this just tends to

00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:27,740
happen adding additional services and

00:08:24,289 --> 00:08:33,020
losing focus is this now a contradiction

00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:35,390
to diversify and to stay focused we

00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:38,000
decided for a mazy labs that we focus

00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:40,010
fully on Drupal technology is clear we

00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,750
do triple only if it's not Drupal it's

00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:43,339
not within our company it might be

00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:44,589
another company within our group but

00:08:43,339 --> 00:08:47,029
it's not going to be amazing labs

00:08:44,589 --> 00:08:48,640
because we believe that we want to stand

00:08:47,029 --> 00:08:51,160
for being the best in or feel

00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:52,930
at least that's what we try and that's

00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:55,060
some something our clients can easily

00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:57,220
refer to it's like you stand for being

00:08:55,060 --> 00:09:00,220
switzerland's largest Drupal company or

00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:02,020
someone else could maybe be just the

00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:04,990
best android app developer whatever it

00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:07,030
is so for those fifty percent that come

00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:10,180
to us for the technology we want have a

00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:13,420
very clear delivery focus or a very

00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:15,640
clear reputation those are maybe the

00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:17,800
cios the CTOs of the company's those

00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:20,500
that do the technology decisions that

00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:23,080
care about what CMS is there but what

00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:24,850
about those other fifty percent we now

00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:26,620
tend the larger the project gets the

00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:28,750
more we tends to talk to the marketing

00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:30,910
people so usually it's now the chief

00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:33,100
marketing officer we're talking to when

00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:34,540
we get the projects and sometimes they

00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:36,700
don't even care what we're going to

00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:38,620
build it on they just assume the product

00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:40,810
is going to work they even assume it's

00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:44,140
usable that's just like the underlying

00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:46,810
assumption so they are surely gonna look

00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:49,420
for something else so the reputation is

00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:53,170
focused of course on different things

00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:55,930
that we can deliver along the line as I

00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:58,420
said one of ours is the design focus and

00:09:55,930 --> 00:10:00,700
that's how we try and get into the other

00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:03,190
area and not just depressing like CIOs

00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:07,020
and details but also the other part of

00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:09,840
the business owners and decision-makers

00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:11,830
so if we go one step back into

00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:13,480
diversification as a topic they're

00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:15,790
generally two ways you can go and

00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:17,530
diversifying you can have a service

00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:19,870
diversification of your business or a

00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:21,640
geographical diversification we've done

00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:23,380
both in the last few years we're going

00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:25,060
to talk more about amazing metrics which

00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:27,730
is the typical path of service

00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:29,980
diversification it's just for example a

00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:32,110
web designing company starting to offer

00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:34,360
web design which hasn't does that before

00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:37,540
or starting to offering hosting hosting

00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:40,630
solutions geographical diversification

00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:43,090
is quite straight we have as being a

00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:45,810
Swiss company starting to offer our

00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:45,810
services abroad

00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:54,210
diversification can start very subtle

00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:56,010
the different means so in Switzerland we

00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:58,500
often observe that we have a very high

00:10:56,010 --> 00:11:00,420
cost level in Switzerland so there are

00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:02,160
many agencies that are now only now

00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:04,410
starting to outsource some of their

00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:06,150
capacity they hire maybe start very

00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:08,670
small hiring one or two freelancers

00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:10,770
abroad maybe in Eastern Europe or some

00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:13,080
other closer place but still with a

00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:14,970
significantly lower cost level that is

00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:17,250
already a form of diversification it

00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:19,110
might be that that agency does not offer

00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:21,600
their services yet in another country

00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:25,800
but they are diversifying because they

00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:27,750
expose themselves to a different legal

00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:29,880
environment to maybe a different

00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:31,590
currency and that's already part of

00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:33,600
diversifying a business just may be a

00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:35,280
very subtle way of course that

00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,290
collaboration can get stronger you could

00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:40,170
we they can start looking for partners

00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:42,300
joint ventures they can merge with other

00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:45,180
companies abroad they can acquire other

00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:46,260
companies and their get into stronger

00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:48,540
forms of collaboration and

00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:50,190
diversification or go the ultimate step

00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:51,990
and just do it yourself go somewhere

00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:54,120
start a new branch open a new location

00:11:51,990 --> 00:12:00,030
be it in a different service area or in

00:11:54,120 --> 00:12:00,900
a different geographic location there

00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:02,880
are many many reasons for

00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:05,280
diversification and this these bubbles

00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:08,790
here they're not exclusive in a way that

00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:10,320
they aim to name all of them these are

00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:12,840
just some that we've seen we've

00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:15,120
experienced the most obvious one

00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:17,640
probably for all business owners is

00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:19,560
revenue growth the own market might just

00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:21,810
be too small it's too small to just

00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:25,230
offer Drupal development in a small

00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:27,180
country possibly might see it's very

00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:29,700
easy to tap into something extended and

00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:33,450
then grow a significant share of your

00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:36,480
revenue risk reduction obviously

00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:38,070
portfolio theory all of you know that if

00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,290
you have different pillars you can stand

00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:42,510
on its not so bad if one breaks away if

00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:44,640
you're a one-trick pony and that one

00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:48,180
trick pony or that pony tends to get

00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:50,700
weak then you can be in big trouble so

00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:54,500
risk reduction on a long term is a very

00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:56,700
important reason for diversification

00:12:54,500 --> 00:13:00,570
extending the service range is another

00:12:56,700 --> 00:13:01,390
one as we seen before and I offering new

00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:03,370
services

00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:06,190
seemed so easy if there's an ongoing

00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:08,110
client relationship where we have happy

00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:10,600
customers we've build websites for them

00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:12,400
with design development it's so easy to

00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:16,570
tap into that and add an additional

00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:19,300
service so adding more services along

00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:22,480
the chain just reduces acquisition costs

00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:24,580
towards adding new clients and acquiring

00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:26,650
new clients the acquisition cost is

00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:28,420
significantly lower in gaining the same

00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:30,940
amount of revenue of an existing client

00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:34,780
than gaining a new client that's another

00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:36,940
good reason for diversification team

00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:38,590
maybe not such an obvious one but we're

00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:41,380
talking about the service business and

00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:44,020
in the service business your team

00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:46,450
members are one of your biggest assets

00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:49,150
if not the only asset we don't have

00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:51,280
anything else our team members are the

00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:52,690
ones who sell our products who build our

00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:55,450
products who are the face to the

00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:57,490
customer they are everything we have and

00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:59,950
we invest a lot of money and our team

00:13:57,490 --> 00:14:01,840
members all of us so we want them to

00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:03,550
stay we want them to be happy we want

00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:06,130
them to be able to expand into different

00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:07,810
areas that's not possible if we don't

00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:09,880
grow if we don't give them new

00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:12,130
opportunities either to grow within our

00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:14,650
organization or within different service

00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:17,890
areas they might just leave much earlier

00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:19,390
than we would have hoped in our

00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:21,130
organization we have very low

00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:24,010
fluctuation in the past years we've had

00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:26,740
a fluctuation of employees of between

00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:28,660
four and seven percent and we believe

00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:31,180
that is not only because people like

00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:32,860
working with us which is very great but

00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:34,780
it's really because they have a career

00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:37,660
path they have a possibility to expand

00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:39,610
and even to change their mind we had one

00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:41,350
early developer in our team who then

00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:43,300
became a web analyst and that's not

00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:47,160
possible if there's no not possible if

00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:50,350
there's no diversification available

00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:52,050
then synergies of course if you have

00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:54,490
team members within different

00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:57,430
geographical areas but mainly different

00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:58,990
disciplines and areas of expertise they

00:14:57,430 --> 00:15:01,000
can share knowledge you can build more

00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:02,710
organizational know-how and that's

00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:06,760
something you can rely on and is a great

00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:08,290
backup sales is another good area we

00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:11,410
already talked about the service range

00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:14,170
it's easier to do sales for different

00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:14,710
companies at once if we finish off a web

00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:17,710
development

00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:20,410
client it's quite easy to add on some

00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:23,050
web analytics SEO SEM because we already

00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:25,450
have a trustworthy functioning client

00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:27,700
relationship so even there again the

00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:30,420
acquisition cost is very low and lead

00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:34,000
generation is quite low to

00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:35,170
attractiveness as the last point of

00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,510
course their companies there may be

00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:38,830
based in Paris London New York that's

00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:41,070
maybe the best case of like

00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:43,450
attractiveness of locations it's maybe

00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:45,940
quite sexy to be able to say you work

00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:47,920
for such a company and it's not always

00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:49,560
that best case with those towns but

00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:51,520
being able to say that you're in

00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:53,550
different locations with different

00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:56,170
services can be very attractive for

00:15:53,550 --> 00:16:00,310
employees so from an employer branding

00:15:56,170 --> 00:16:05,740
perspective and diversification can be a

00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:08,560
good a good argument so how are we

00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:10,750
structured within our group we had

00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:13,180
amazing labs that was then created in

00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:16,150
2010 bit based on the company amazing

00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:17,860
calm we have this spinoff amazing

00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:20,350
metrics i quickly mentioned so amazing

00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:22,270
metrics is an online marketing company

00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:23,890
that is focused on SEO SEM and web

00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:26,380
analytics I'll talk a bit more about

00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:28,390
that case later on so that was a new

00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:31,390
company that we established at the same

00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:33,550
location of our first amazing lab Zurich

00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:36,280
company then we had to further

00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:38,920
geographical and diversifications that

00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:41,710
were also own entities that we built so

00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:45,430
a new entity in Austin in 2014 and a new

00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:47,050
entity in 2015 in Cape Town and when we

00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:49,900
built the Austin team we set up a

00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:52,240
holding company to sit on top which owns

00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:53,590
all the companies underneath that's just

00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,740
how the structure works so these are all

00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:58,090
individual legal entities now we're

00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:59,500
going to talk about amazing metrics

00:16:58,090 --> 00:17:01,030
because this is the classical path of

00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:04,750
service diversification which is

00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:06,520
diversification beyond Drupal just going

00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:10,270
to tell you a bit of how this happened

00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:12,040
it didn't just come on the way it build

00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:14,290
up and that spark was actually that we

00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:17,200
had a large large client forum AZ labs a

00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:19,839
big website that we have built and that

00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:21,940
customer had wanted more from us a very

00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:23,880
very typical situation and the question

00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:25,770
was if we couldn't offer web analytics

00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:27,449
services because one of our developers

00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:30,660
who was involved with that project and

00:17:27,449 --> 00:17:32,520
was very strong in web analytics and so

00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:35,490
we did agree to provide these web

00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:40,080
analytics services to this company all

00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:42,180
under the amazing labs Zurich roof so at

00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:43,770
that time we noticed that there's a big

00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:45,570
business opportunity there there were

00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:47,730
other customers tapping into that

00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:50,940
direction we just identified we could

00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:53,460
build a business out of this or offer it

00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:55,050
in addition to what we do now the

00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:56,820
question that came up is how is why are

00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:58,140
we going to promote it is it going to be

00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:59,700
like a new landing page on our website

00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:01,080
or how are we going to now tell the

00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:03,930
world that we're also offering web

00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:05,640
analytics SEO and SEM and we found out

00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:07,560
it's not going to work that way amazing

00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:10,100
labs sound so much for triple

00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:12,750
development that we're gonna dilute our

00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:15,300
branding if we start offering all these

00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:17,190
things alongside there were other

00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:20,190
arguments that led to us building a new

00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:21,510
company one very important one was that

00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:24,690
amazing lab Zurich was very successful

00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:27,660
at that time and we did not want to take

00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:30,150
the risk of pulling it down if our new

00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:32,280
venture doesn't work so diversifying

00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:33,960
into new service is of course like

00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:36,510
starting a new venture you don't know if

00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:38,160
it's going to work out or not so we made

00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:42,420
just the strategic decision to outsource

00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:44,730
or spin off that new branch in order to

00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:48,540
ensure that the successful running

00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:50,280
entity is and can stay healthy that the

00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:52,740
developers are the whole team members of

00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:55,260
the healthy entity don't get punished if

00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:57,120
maybe the new one doesn't work out and

00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:58,760
maybe we're not even able to pay a bonus

00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:02,520
or good salaries by the end of the year

00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:06,210
so we wanted to just outsource that risk

00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:08,400
into a new entity we also wanted to find

00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:11,040
a leader for that new team that is in

00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:13,350
full profit and loss responsibility not

00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:15,360
just may be running a cost center within

00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:17,490
our organization but being fully

00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:19,230
responsible of building a team building

00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:20,820
a service portfolio and having

00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:23,100
responsibility for the success or the

00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:25,350
failure those were the main reasons why

00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:28,380
we built amazing metrics with a new

00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:31,520
brand in a new entity but building on

00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:31,520
the main amazing brand

00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:39,520
back to the reason so what reasons

00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:42,010
really were pulling us or bringing us to

00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:43,720
do this step revenue growth for sure

00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:45,130
that was probably the main driver we did

00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:47,470
see the business opportunity and we

00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:49,930
thought we could expand and grow our

00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:52,800
revenue which did happen after we

00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:54,940
started amazing metrics Risk Reduction

00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:57,070
that turned out to be a very theoretical

00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:59,260
thing so portfolio theory would say of

00:19:57,070 --> 00:20:01,930
course that diversifying reduces risk at

00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:03,700
that time it was just increasing risk it

00:20:01,930 --> 00:20:05,920
was we didn't know if it's going to turn

00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:08,410
out we did decide to outsource that part

00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:10,900
to spin it off to make sure that the

00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:12,940
healthy entity is not at risk and short

00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:15,070
a midterm it just increased the risk of

00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:16,840
our entire group not in a bad way it's

00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:19,150
fine but just the risk exposure is

00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:21,460
higher so it seems turned out to be

00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:23,560
quite a theoretical thing on a shorter

00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:27,070
midterm long term this of course does

00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:31,000
work out service range extension yes

00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:33,070
it's obvious we now include our the SEO

00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,140
SEM and analytic services of amazing

00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:37,540
metrics into all of our proposals it's

00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:39,400
like an add-on we can tell our clients

00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:41,530
and by the way when you're done or

00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:44,740
during the development you could also do

00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:47,710
this on sites audit or the off-site

00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:49,540
analysis and actually forty percent

00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:52,180
about of our clients do choose to work

00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:54,160
with our sister company to which is a

00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:55,870
very nice success rate and which proves

00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:59,200
that we had a successful step into

00:20:55,870 --> 00:21:01,180
extending our service range the team

00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,830
aspect we talked about earlier so the

00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:04,870
skills and career paths between our two

00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:06,760
companies there are quite different so

00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:08,470
there hasn't been any real mingle there

00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:11,200
yet anyone stepping over from one

00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:13,120
company to the other but the synergies

00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,590
are clearly there so the both teams sit

00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:17,140
together in an office they're very close

00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:19,060
be it over lunch or after our drinks or

00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:20,910
just sitting together over a meeting and

00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:24,250
discussing what can be done together

00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:26,140
they can do the monthly analytics of our

00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:28,510
website we can help them with some

00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:31,530
technical SEO implementation so they're

00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:34,900
clearly synergies between those teams

00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:37,840
the sales side again builds up on our

00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:39,910
service range so if the Zurich CEO goes

00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:43,060
to a conference it's easy to pitch the

00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:46,420
other service in one line with it so it

00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:48,990
just did also ease sales of both

00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:48,990
businesses

00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:57,010
now I'm not going to go in depth into

00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:59,409
the case Austin or Cape Town but I

00:21:57,010 --> 00:22:02,620
quickly want to say that also there

00:21:59,409 --> 00:22:05,320
there was a spark why we did this why we

00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:06,970
went to Austin it was not that we sat at

00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:09,399
a board table and thought what's the

00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:11,860
next step it was that we had to

00:22:09,399 --> 00:22:14,470
enormously talented people living in San

00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:15,909
Antonio working for us as freelancers we

00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:18,190
tried to integrate them more into the

00:22:15,909 --> 00:22:20,019
team so at that time we only had a

00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:23,080
location at Zurich an office location

00:22:20,019 --> 00:22:24,700
and also only served European clients we

00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:25,990
wanted to bring them over that didn't

00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:28,600
work out because of the work permit

00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:30,669
situation and so we were thinking of

00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:32,289
alternatives and decided it would be

00:22:30,669 --> 00:22:33,970
nice to build something around them so

00:22:32,289 --> 00:22:37,000
if they can't come to us we might go to

00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:40,179
them and San Antonio was maybe not the

00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,889
most attractive placed to choose but we

00:22:40,179 --> 00:22:43,929
looked at other European cities and also

00:22:41,889 --> 00:22:46,299
at other global cities and found that

00:22:43,929 --> 00:22:48,460
Austin would be a very attractive place

00:22:46,299 --> 00:22:50,590
for different reasons our reasons

00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:54,130
included how interesting is the market

00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:55,960
how interesting is the talent how hip is

00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:58,059
the whole place how tech-savvy is the

00:22:55,960 --> 00:23:00,010
place and Austin ranked very well so we

00:22:58,059 --> 00:23:01,630
decided together with our two team

00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:04,750
members Catherine Andrew that will open

00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:05,860
in hub or open a team office in Austin

00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:09,159
and that they will move there and

00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:11,950
operate from there again then we found

00:23:09,159 --> 00:23:14,679
it a known legal entity hired a CEO and

00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:16,480
build the team around our core members

00:23:14,679 --> 00:23:20,350
captain Andrew which has been very

00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:21,639
successful they're very busy cape town

00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:24,669
was again a completely different case

00:23:21,639 --> 00:23:26,919
cape town was the case that my husband

00:23:24,669 --> 00:23:28,210
Gregory who's my co-founder is half

00:23:26,919 --> 00:23:30,490
south african and we've been spending

00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:31,929
lots of time there on holidays and it

00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:34,330
just has become a personal wish of ours

00:23:31,929 --> 00:23:36,159
to move to South Africa and so we made a

00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:37,750
plan how to step more out of the

00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:41,049
day-to-day operations of the Zurich

00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:44,019
entity and how we could start our lives

00:23:41,049 --> 00:23:46,029
in South Africa so that's what we did we

00:23:44,019 --> 00:23:49,149
found a leader for the Zurich team hired

00:23:46,029 --> 00:23:51,429
him and started stepping a little bit

00:23:49,149 --> 00:23:53,769
back and last October we moved to Cape

00:23:51,429 --> 00:23:55,510
Town but we didn't know if we're going

00:23:53,769 --> 00:23:57,580
to start a business in Cape Town it was

00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:59,370
an opportunistic decision that came

00:23:57,580 --> 00:24:00,960
after we admit the community there

00:23:59,370 --> 00:24:03,210
so we started stepping into that

00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:05,370
community meeting people looking at

00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:07,440
Drupal seeing whats around looking at

00:24:05,370 --> 00:24:09,450
the market and then just one took the

00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:12,510
next and we started talking to people we

00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:14,309
wanted to acquire a small company there

00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:15,960
or were thinking about it but then

00:24:14,309 --> 00:24:18,690
decided not to do two different

00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:21,480
expectations but hired two local people

00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:23,340
and started building and the team there

00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:25,740
that was in June actually that we

00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:28,020
started um it's been very busy I now run

00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:30,840
the Cape Town office and been running

00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:32,970
and trying to solve some legal things

00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:34,470
and things don't always run as smooth in

00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:36,990
South Africa's they do another country

00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:39,630
so still chasing some certificates and

00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:40,830
but now it's our third month no actually

00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:42,270
our fourth month that we're running and

00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:46,520
I just hired the sixth person so it's

00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:49,230
working well and it's keeping us busy

00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:50,760
now again what do these three cases just

00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:52,380
all have in common and discounts for us

00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:54,720
it can be different for anyone else but

00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:57,210
they all just grasps an opportunity

00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:58,679
rather than forcing growth so these

00:24:57,210 --> 00:25:00,630
decisions were made based on something

00:24:58,679 --> 00:25:04,080
that was around either a personal choice

00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:05,610
and emotion a situation it's not that we

00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:07,380
make these decisions at a board table

00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:09,390
that we sit together every year and say

00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:11,820
okay now yours over what are we going to

00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:14,190
do next it's that we see something it

00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:16,200
feels something interesting we want to

00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:18,330
pursue and then see if it's something we

00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:21,300
can build around we do create

00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:23,190
spreadsheets after that so it's like the

00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:25,650
number crunching and all the analytics

00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:28,980
that follows after that gut feeling and

00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:30,660
some kind of emotional decision so we to

00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:38,010
justify that cut then that gut feeling

00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:40,559
with some number juggling now there are

00:25:38,010 --> 00:25:44,610
three main areas of challenges that we

00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:47,640
have experienced the first financial

00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:49,890
resources of course this doesn't work

00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:51,840
without money you can bootstrap

00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:55,050
accompany you start you can start with

00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:57,600
few resources but at the end there's no

00:25:55,050 --> 00:25:59,370
way around getting an office maybe

00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:02,490
hiring some resources that you can't

00:25:59,370 --> 00:26:03,929
fully fully make billable yet there is

00:26:02,490 --> 00:26:05,700
some overhead going into this whole

00:26:03,929 --> 00:26:07,830
process so without financial resources

00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:09,840
it's not possible to do any of these

00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:13,049
steps although it can be managed and of

00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:15,570
course bootstrapping is possible

00:26:13,049 --> 00:26:17,009
one very very important area that we

00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:18,899
have discovered in the past two years

00:26:17,009 --> 00:26:21,649
and I've experienced also in very

00:26:18,899 --> 00:26:24,480
painful ways is the increased complexity

00:26:21,649 --> 00:26:26,580
we have five legal entities they all

00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:28,830
need accounting some of them have

00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:30,809
different accounting systems they all

00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:33,989
need management capacity they need own

00:26:30,809 --> 00:26:35,340
contracts they need own regulations all

00:26:33,989 --> 00:26:37,350
of a sudden you start thinking about

00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:39,149
things like cross building what if this

00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:40,799
company works for this one what if this

00:26:39,149 --> 00:26:42,989
one starts working for this one how do

00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:44,759
we build that different currencies

00:26:42,989 --> 00:26:47,909
different market rates does that work

00:26:44,759 --> 00:26:49,830
taxwise all these questions that one

00:26:47,909 --> 00:26:51,659
maybe tends to underestimate a little

00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:54,450
bit when you start just offering new

00:26:51,659 --> 00:26:56,580
services but due to the fact that we did

00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:58,559
create separate legal entities we did

00:26:56,580 --> 00:27:01,220
blow up operations quite a bit so you

00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:03,659
create a lot of overhead with this and

00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:05,580
what's also not to underestimate is the

00:27:03,659 --> 00:27:07,859
increase of the technical complexity so

00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:10,259
the processes that become more complex

00:27:07,859 --> 00:27:13,529
if I look boss he's not in the room but

00:27:10,259 --> 00:27:15,389
our DevOps person busty he struggling

00:27:13,529 --> 00:27:17,220
sometimes quite a bit to think of our

00:27:15,389 --> 00:27:19,619
server setup if we have these clients

00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:20,940
all over and how do we charge these

00:27:19,619 --> 00:27:24,809
things and how do we manage these

00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:27,629
processes so how did we address that I

00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:30,539
mean we did need lots of management

00:27:27,629 --> 00:27:32,519
capacity we did build our company out of

00:27:30,539 --> 00:27:34,169
management capacity so when we started

00:27:32,519 --> 00:27:35,549
we had zero technical know-how which

00:27:34,169 --> 00:27:38,340
made it very difficult for us at that

00:27:35,549 --> 00:27:39,840
time but we were able to bring in

00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:42,210
management capacity and just deal with

00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:44,039
it so when we started a new company we

00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:45,749
knew for example amazing metrics we're

00:27:44,039 --> 00:27:47,369
going to need a new CEO from day one

00:27:45,749 --> 00:27:49,200
we're going to need someone to run that

00:27:47,369 --> 00:27:51,840
business it won't be possible to just

00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:53,159
like that team grow organically so

00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,629
either we applied the existing

00:27:53,159 --> 00:27:57,059
management capacity we had within our

00:27:54,629 --> 00:28:02,970
founder team or we hired new managers to

00:27:57,059 --> 00:28:05,609
come in um the third area of challenges

00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:08,850
that we've seen are the cultural

00:28:05,609 --> 00:28:10,619
challenges and this is probably worth

00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:12,149
the talk on its own and I know that

00:28:10,619 --> 00:28:14,129
there is another talk somewhere in the

00:28:12,149 --> 00:28:17,059
business track during these days about

00:28:14,129 --> 00:28:19,409
culture company culture but also

00:28:17,059 --> 00:28:23,279
challenges and working remotely with

00:28:19,409 --> 00:28:26,520
different cultures it starts from

00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:28,560
different time zone only a few hours of

00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:31,830
overlapping working time higher

00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:35,160
flexibility expected from the team there

00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:38,160
are so many aspects that come in its

00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:40,590
different lingo I mean we see that our

00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:43,410
company language is English everyone

00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:45,360
speaks English but English in

00:28:43,410 --> 00:28:50,130
Switzerland the u.s. and South Africa is

00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:51,390
not the same one very maybe many of you

00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:53,640
are aware of the differences between the

00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:55,650
American and the English or the European

00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:57,930
culture but the South African culture

00:28:55,650 --> 00:29:01,230
brings very new fun aspects into one

00:28:57,930 --> 00:29:07,710
example is there are different meanings

00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:10,650
of now in South African now means maybe

00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:13,560
some time in South African maybe if

00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:19,200
you're lucky some time then there is now

00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:23,520
now that means probably today and then

00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:25,950
there is no sorry I'm just I just

00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:28,140
confused note just now is the next step

00:29:25,950 --> 00:29:30,600
between now and just now just now is

00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:33,810
probably today and then there's now now

00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:36,480
which means as soon as I get to it but

00:29:33,810 --> 00:29:38,220
it doesn't mean now so now now in South

00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:40,530
African doesn't mean now now at this

00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:42,210
moment it means as soon as I get to it

00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:44,130
which could be after I've gone to the

00:29:42,210 --> 00:29:46,260
toilet after I've had a coffee and after

00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:47,910
I've done three other things and that's

00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:49,440
actually as good as it gets you won't

00:29:47,910 --> 00:29:51,360
find to find any South African to give

00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,530
you anything better than now now so

00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:55,530
you're just gonna have to live with that

00:29:52,530 --> 00:29:57,630
but now imagine a Swiss saying do this

00:29:55,530 --> 00:29:59,600
now and the South African thinking

00:29:57,630 --> 00:30:01,920
that's good enough if I do it by Friday

00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:04,260
so these things have to be addressed

00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:06,150
there's nothing you can't deal with it

00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:08,220
in any other way than making it

00:30:06,150 --> 00:30:10,890
transparent bringing it onto the table

00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:13,110
and talking to you people and saying if

00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:15,150
you say this this person is gonna

00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:17,250
understand this now you're going to have

00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:19,560
to find a common understanding and maybe

00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:22,140
replace now with a date and a time to

00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:24,240
make it clear for everyone and these are

00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:26,310
all very tiny things but they can become

00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:29,340
significant in a project and that maybe

00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:31,080
has a very tight deadline so with all of

00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:33,000
these challenges they are there and they

00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:35,160
are strong but they can all be addressed

00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,150
and we just try addressing them with

00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:38,310
lots of transparent

00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:39,870
see and we also do lots of mistakes but

00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:42,360
we just try and bring it up on the table

00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:44,390
and deal with it when it's there the

00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:47,070
nice thing is that it's lots of fun I

00:30:44,390 --> 00:30:50,850
mean experience it and overcoming these

00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:53,550
challenges is is a great thing and every

00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:55,170
company makes its own choice or the

00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:56,610
people behind the company what they want

00:30:55,170 --> 00:30:59,520
to be what they want to stand for what

00:30:56,610 --> 00:31:01,320
is their vision our vision is fold it

00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:03,270
sounds bold to say we want to be a

00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:05,790
leading global web service provider but

00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:07,320
it is true it's our vision it might be

00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:08,880
that we achieve that within a few years

00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:10,500
and it might not but it's something we

00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:13,230
strive for we want to have that bold

00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:14,970
vision we want to explore the borders we

00:31:13,230 --> 00:31:17,760
want to cross those borders we want to

00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:20,060
find the next big project and that's how

00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:22,320
we define entrepreneurship for ourselves

00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:24,090
so we like these challenges and to

00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:25,830
overcome them and we try to just have a

00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:28,470
good laugh in between if something goes

00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:29,490
wrong and try and fix the things so we

00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:31,110
want to give everyone in the team

00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:34,140
something that they can work for that

00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:37,410
they can look ahead work for be proud of

00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:39,300
and that's something that just keeps me

00:31:37,410 --> 00:31:42,500
running every day and trying to make a

00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:44,910
better job with every next step and

00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:46,470
that's actually already the end because

00:31:44,910 --> 00:31:48,180
there's so many more things we could get

00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:50,010
into detail but I know that the

00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:52,200
experiences in this room the experience

00:31:50,010 --> 00:31:54,810
is so diverse and maybe this would be

00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:57,120
just a nice time to open up to discuss a

00:31:54,810 --> 00:31:59,100
few questions I'm sure you have things

00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:01,680
to contribute what are your ideas of

00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:03,180
diversification and it would be nice to

00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:04,980
open up the round for some questions and

00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:06,780
discussions and anytime if you have

00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:09,120
questions to me please address them and

00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:10,850
here it's my contact information if you

00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:13,710
happen to come to Cape Town ping me and

00:32:10,850 --> 00:32:16,760
have a beer and thank you for listening

00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:16,760
and let's discuss further

00:32:22,769 --> 00:32:32,619
so any questions any comments we can

00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:34,389
just write that yeah so the question is

00:32:32,619 --> 00:32:36,789
in case you didn't understand if we

00:32:34,389 --> 00:32:43,029
service our Swiss customers from Cape

00:32:36,789 --> 00:32:44,830
Town um or vice versa yes and no so the

00:32:43,029 --> 00:32:47,200
Swiss company is in charge of dealing

00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:49,090
with the Swiss customers now what we've

00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:51,489
started doing and that's also one of our

00:32:49,090 --> 00:32:54,009
strategic goals is we do want to reduce

00:32:51,489 --> 00:32:56,259
costs of our Swiss operation team which

00:32:54,009 --> 00:33:00,249
is the largest there are over 25 people

00:32:56,259 --> 00:33:02,529
now in Zurich and by outsourcing work to

00:33:00,249 --> 00:33:04,029
Cape Town and we've started that it's

00:33:02,529 --> 00:33:05,440
very fresh because we just hired the

00:33:04,029 --> 00:33:06,789
first people in June and started

00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:08,859
operations then but we've already had

00:33:06,789 --> 00:33:11,889
some few things that have can that were

00:33:08,859 --> 00:33:13,809
able to be pushed down to the Cape Town

00:33:11,889 --> 00:33:15,820
office but they're still managed by the

00:33:13,809 --> 00:33:17,529
Zurich team so the project managers

00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:21,429
remain in Zurich we just want to add

00:33:17,529 --> 00:33:23,609
development capacity in cape town and we

00:33:21,429 --> 00:33:26,679
would serve Swiss kite clients directly

00:33:23,609 --> 00:33:29,649
from Cape Town if they were small and

00:33:26,679 --> 00:33:31,029
not relevant for the Zurich team if the

00:33:29,649 --> 00:33:33,609
Zurich team would say look this is not

00:33:31,029 --> 00:33:35,379
something we can do it's not what it's

00:33:33,609 --> 00:33:37,119
not a budget we can look after and the

00:33:35,379 --> 00:33:38,919
Cape Town team would say ah maybe we

00:33:37,119 --> 00:33:43,979
could then it would be fine otherwise it

00:33:38,919 --> 00:33:43,979
would all run via the Zurich team yes

00:33:44,970 --> 00:33:47,970
yes

00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:05,160
yes

00:34:12,210 --> 00:34:17,750
yes I'm so did everyone understand that

00:34:14,849 --> 00:34:20,639
question no okay so the question was if

00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:22,919
just being solely focused on Drupal from

00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:25,050
a technology point of view is a big risk

00:34:22,919 --> 00:34:26,849
if we have ever considered looking at

00:34:25,050 --> 00:34:28,770
other CMS looking at other technologies

00:34:26,849 --> 00:34:32,190
to diversify within the technology that

00:34:28,770 --> 00:34:33,899
we offer um I mean Michael could answer

00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:35,790
this question better than I can but no

00:34:33,899 --> 00:34:37,950
actually we do consider that we consider

00:34:35,790 --> 00:34:40,020
that all the time but not in a serious

00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:42,149
way that we say we want to go away it's

00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:45,240
just that we have a half yearly review

00:34:42,149 --> 00:34:47,399
Michael monitors he's so into everything

00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:49,980
that happens within the whole open

00:34:47,399 --> 00:34:51,780
source world and that we just sit

00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:54,089
together have a look at the status quo

00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:56,700
and decide again are we going to move

00:34:54,089 --> 00:34:58,830
forward as we have decided or are we

00:34:56,700 --> 00:35:00,960
going to look away so that's like a half

00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:02,730
your assessment we do just reconfirming

00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:04,650
our strategy saying this is what

00:35:02,730 --> 00:35:06,300
happened in the last half year we think

00:35:04,650 --> 00:35:08,310
it's still safe to continue this way

00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:09,480
until now was always a very clear

00:35:08,310 --> 00:35:11,160
decision that we're going to stick to

00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:13,320
tuple we do believe that this

00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:15,359
positioning that we have is very strong

00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:17,820
there are many clients that come to us

00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:20,430
because we just do that and because

00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:21,960
we're just quite good at that and if we

00:35:20,430 --> 00:35:24,750
start diversifying I do think the

00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:26,280
dilutional effect is significant and so

00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:28,260
until now it was clear but we do

00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:30,390
consider it yes all the time we don't

00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:32,280
want to run into a wall and I mean we

00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:34,470
see the risks now dreese addressed it in

00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:36,599
a good way this morning and I we feel

00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:40,130
that all and it's not that we can say

00:35:36,599 --> 00:35:40,130
we're not nervous about what's happening

00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:45,680
yes

00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:05,040
okay cool no that's not a secret at all

00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:06,660
of course not so the question was how

00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:08,460
many people work in our office was it

00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:10,380
only were you asking cape town office or

00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:13,250
a cape town office and what

00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:16,530
nationalities they are so we are now

00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:18,619
bye-bye hiring first of November will be

00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:21,300
eight people in the cape town office

00:36:18,619 --> 00:36:24,300
including Gregory and myself who are the

00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:26,700
founders nationalities are wow I have to

00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:28,650
count so we are Swiss German South

00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:33,030
African and all the others are South

00:36:28,650 --> 00:36:34,680
African that's quite easy so then and

00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:37,170
the mix of nationalities is much much

00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:39,150
bigger in the Zurich team the Zurich

00:36:37,170 --> 00:36:40,470
team covers all kinds of nationalities

00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:41,609
we just found out this week I'm not

00:36:40,470 --> 00:36:43,170
going to say because I think there's

00:36:41,609 --> 00:36:44,940
going to be like a small Twitter

00:36:43,170 --> 00:36:46,349
competition going on but we have many

00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:48,150
different languages in the team and it's

00:36:46,349 --> 00:36:49,980
quite diverse but Cape Town is quite

00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:52,099
straightforward we try to hire locals

00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:52,099
only

00:37:14,430 --> 00:37:22,200
yes I'm good question um so the question

00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:23,430
is that truth know what Julian and works

00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:27,180
for a company with seven different

00:37:23,430 --> 00:37:28,829
locations and how did we or if we did

00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:30,540
manage to create links between the

00:37:28,829 --> 00:37:34,559
developers that sit in those different

00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:36,869
locations um yes we did I mean maybe

00:37:34,559 --> 00:37:39,210
it's easier or core has been very strong

00:37:36,869 --> 00:37:41,220
in Zurich and then the new companies

00:37:39,210 --> 00:37:43,770
they developed as outposts so when

00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:46,260
Austin started they started because they

00:37:43,770 --> 00:37:47,940
were freelancers within our team so the

00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:50,069
both team members of Austin they knew

00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:51,750
the Zurich team very well they've been

00:37:50,069 --> 00:37:53,160
visiting us we've been seeing each other

00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:55,079
I call so there was a personal

00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:57,240
relationship that made everything very

00:37:55,079 --> 00:37:59,130
easy with the Cape Town office it was

00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:01,170
different these people are new so these

00:37:59,130 --> 00:38:03,059
links need to be created it's easy to

00:38:01,170 --> 00:38:04,980
create the links because we founders are

00:38:03,059 --> 00:38:06,780
now down there so we can somehow create

00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:08,700
these links but we also do it through

00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:11,520
some structure so there is some

00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:14,450
structure that goes above the legal

00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:17,040
entity just to give an example there is

00:38:14,450 --> 00:38:20,010
for example Sasha who's sitting here too

00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:23,160
he runs and I think monthly or every

00:38:20,010 --> 00:38:25,650
three weeks and the Front's Tuesday the

00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:27,359
front Tuesday is just an hour where all

00:38:25,650 --> 00:38:29,790
the front-end reserved the group sit

00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:31,740
together and talk about topics and the

00:38:29,790 --> 00:38:34,260
same we have for backend for site

00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:36,420
building and for project managers so we

00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:39,359
do have meetups that maybe run on a 3-2

00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:41,099
for weekly basis where everyone not meet

00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:43,470
up physically of course but meet up on a

00:38:41,099 --> 00:38:44,940
hang out and chat together and this has

00:38:43,470 --> 00:38:46,290
become very important because first of

00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:48,329
all they start building a relationship

00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:49,710
but there's lots of knowledge exchange

00:38:48,329 --> 00:38:52,710
between the groups that would otherwise

00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:53,940
not happen and so maybe I don't know if

00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:56,430
that's a way or if it's something that

00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:58,500
your organization has considered but

00:38:56,430 --> 00:39:00,630
creating a level of meetings not to

00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:03,210
overdo it but in some routine that is

00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:04,710
above the legal entity and that links

00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:07,619
the people together that work in the

00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:11,339
same functions as proof I mean until now

00:39:07,619 --> 00:39:12,809
is proven very successful for us the

00:39:11,339 --> 00:39:15,589
people enjoy it they like chatting to

00:39:12,809 --> 00:39:15,589
the other people yep

00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:36,890
yes yeah yes it's emerging so the

00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:38,359
question is we know that in Austin and

00:39:36,890 --> 00:39:39,920
in Europe we have strong communities in

00:39:38,359 --> 00:39:41,480
Drupal is very adopted but what about

00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:44,090
South Africa because that's quite exotic

00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:47,090
on that whole landscape it is exotic yes

00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:49,040
um it's emerging so when we came there

00:39:47,090 --> 00:39:51,920
first last year it really felt a bit

00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:54,920
when we start as when we started in 2007

00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:56,720
I really feel it's like rewind eight

00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:59,090
years or seven years that's how it felt

00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:02,900
it's a very small community but very

00:39:59,090 --> 00:40:05,030
enthusiastic am NOT building to complex

00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:07,760
things yet you see that the adoption of

00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:10,070
Drupal has not happened yet so much in

00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:11,390
larger South African companies but

00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:12,710
what's very nice is that some

00:40:11,390 --> 00:40:14,840
governments in South Africa's I have

00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:17,990
started to adopt Drupal and they are

00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:20,990
pushing that now much more and we have

00:40:17,990 --> 00:40:22,700
seen that us now being there has also

00:40:20,990 --> 00:40:25,850
moved something I mean we've been

00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:27,200
organizing or co organizing a camp now

00:40:25,850 --> 00:40:28,430
it was the first triple camp in Cape

00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,840
Town it happened on the fourth of

00:40:28,430 --> 00:40:31,880
September there were over 100 people

00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:33,680
coming which was quite a success because

00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:35,810
the community is really not that big but

00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:37,490
there's lots of enthusiasm in the

00:40:35,810 --> 00:40:39,890
community and I think it will grow

00:40:37,490 --> 00:40:41,720
significantly in the next year's but

00:40:39,890 --> 00:40:43,460
it's still at a state where maybe lots

00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:45,380
of European countries were like seven

00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:47,600
eight years ago in terms of adoption of

00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:50,240
Drupal within the developer community

00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:54,340
but also within the the clients and the

00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:54,340
adopters yes

00:41:01,310 --> 00:41:06,140
it depends on on our entity so we have

00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:08,090
different metrics for each organization

00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:10,280
because Zurich of course has a higher

00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:11,930
level because they're a large organized

00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:14,960
I mean larger organization with more

00:41:11,930 --> 00:41:17,810
specialized functions they only take it

00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:19,310
I mean except larger projects and just

00:41:17,810 --> 00:41:20,870
to manage the complexity otherwise we

00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:22,550
can't justify our set up with having

00:41:20,870 --> 00:41:25,490
project manager front and back and side

00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:27,050
builder all that but for example Austin

00:41:25,490 --> 00:41:29,180
is more flexible there are more

00:41:27,050 --> 00:41:31,400
targeting a medium range of project and

00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:32,960
Cape Town is a real startup it's just

00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:35,690
like we're looking at whatever comes in

00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:38,560
and see if it's doable or not so the

00:41:35,690 --> 00:41:41,600
management and the process behind

00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:43,730
accepting a project is very different if

00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:45,680
you just look at the metrics where it's

00:41:43,730 --> 00:41:47,270
not different is in the style and what

00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:49,040
we want to assess and what we want to

00:41:47,270 --> 00:41:51,500
know if a client so we do try and bring

00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:53,060
in some general values to give it to

00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:54,830
leave a footprint so all amazed elapsed

00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:57,230
products should have the same footprint

00:41:54,830 --> 00:41:59,930
but they're completely different metrics

00:41:57,230 --> 00:42:05,110
in terms of size does that answer your

00:41:59,930 --> 00:42:05,110
question yes

00:42:10,350 --> 00:42:15,660
oh haha how hard was it to leave the

00:42:13,770 --> 00:42:18,090
Zurich office and leave it to someone

00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:20,700
else that's a good and very personal

00:42:18,090 --> 00:42:23,940
question it was hard and it started

00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:26,160
quite a bit before we left for me

00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:28,170
personally maybe I was always or I am in

00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:29,670
charge of the whole financial parts of

00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:31,110
the business that's of course my

00:42:29,670 --> 00:42:32,960
background you know my previous life

00:42:31,110 --> 00:42:35,610
being an accountant it's obvious and

00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:36,990
that's a very difficult area to let go

00:42:35,610 --> 00:42:38,790
of because it's a lot of control

00:42:36,990 --> 00:42:40,590
involved if you control the finance and

00:42:38,790 --> 00:42:42,780
all that and I must admit that I still

00:42:40,590 --> 00:42:45,600
do that I'm still running the finances

00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:48,060
of the Zurich office and that's a good

00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:51,360
thing and it works well it keeps me

00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:54,330
close to the team it keeps me in control

00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:57,090
of what's happening um and that the loss

00:42:54,330 --> 00:42:58,590
maybe is not that big we found of course

00:42:57,090 --> 00:43:00,990
when you co to step in to run the

00:42:58,590 --> 00:43:04,560
everyday business but one can maybe not

00:43:00,990 --> 00:43:06,420
underestimate the loss of founders it's

00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:08,160
just something that has somehow been

00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:10,560
important to the team until that point

00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:13,500
and it's not only me it's been Greg and

00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:15,390
me both leaving so we did have to

00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:18,000
prepare it very carefully but I must say

00:43:15,390 --> 00:43:20,640
I do think it was very smooth there were

00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:22,110
no real major hiccups it's maybe small

00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:23,700
things that were happening but they were

00:43:22,110 --> 00:43:26,580
all we just put him on the table and try

00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:29,010
to fix them and it was hard because

00:43:26,580 --> 00:43:30,390
letting go is hard depending on what

00:43:29,010 --> 00:43:31,830
kind of person you are but I think the

00:43:30,390 --> 00:43:34,380
majority of us will agree that letting

00:43:31,830 --> 00:43:37,050
go is not easy but it's also a relief

00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:38,820
and seeing that it works and it was

00:43:37,050 --> 00:43:41,370
running perfectly well the success of

00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:43,890
the office was been great um since we

00:43:41,370 --> 00:43:46,110
left so it's not like it can't work

00:43:43,890 --> 00:43:47,850
without us but it's just it's a it's a

00:43:46,110 --> 00:43:49,650
process that you need to address and

00:43:47,850 --> 00:43:51,150
it's a very personal thing and I need to

00:43:49,650 --> 00:43:53,880
go through these steps and just find out

00:43:51,150 --> 00:43:55,890
what I need to do to let go but I'm not

00:43:53,880 --> 00:44:02,240
letting go I'm still there so that's

00:43:55,890 --> 00:44:02,240
nice yep

00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:08,599
yes

00:44:48,490 --> 00:44:57,990
okay I'm very good question yes yes

00:44:59,869 --> 00:45:04,609
yes I'm very good question so the

00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:06,140
question in summary our cost reduction

00:45:04,609 --> 00:45:07,700
we've talked about that with cape town

00:45:06,140 --> 00:45:10,309
of course being at lower cost has it at

00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:11,509
any stage been a risk that that zurich

00:45:10,309 --> 00:45:13,069
steam all of a sudden would feel

00:45:11,509 --> 00:45:14,630
threatened by the cape town office

00:45:13,069 --> 00:45:16,549
growing and maybe taking away work that

00:45:14,630 --> 00:45:19,430
was the first part the second part was

00:45:16,549 --> 00:45:21,109
do we see any risk that our brands could

00:45:19,430 --> 00:45:23,210
be negatively associated with

00:45:21,109 --> 00:45:24,890
outsourcing if we start pushing work to

00:45:23,210 --> 00:45:26,809
cape town you know that we become like a

00:45:24,890 --> 00:45:28,660
kind of outsourcing company that does

00:45:26,809 --> 00:45:31,759
the you know the work in a cheap country

00:45:28,660 --> 00:45:34,069
good questions the first one so first

00:45:31,759 --> 00:45:35,599
one no I I mean I can't answer it

00:45:34,069 --> 00:45:37,670
because I'm not sitting in Zurich but I

00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:39,400
really i think i can confirm that at no

00:45:37,670 --> 00:45:42,170
point the zurich steam would feel

00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:44,269
threatened by Cape Town and this has

00:45:42,170 --> 00:45:46,249
many different reasons the first of all

00:45:44,269 --> 00:45:48,079
the hourly rate in cape town is so

00:45:46,249 --> 00:45:51,859
significantly lower than in zurich that

00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:54,109
we can't even compete it's not that it's

00:45:51,859 --> 00:45:56,180
not that we would do projects in zurich

00:45:54,109 --> 00:45:58,880
that need quality work delivered you

00:45:56,180 --> 00:46:00,859
know by visor ii teams and we can't it's

00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:04,579
like it's two different worlds they

00:46:00,859 --> 00:46:07,249
couldn't it can only mix if it's being

00:46:04,579 --> 00:46:10,099
run by a Zurich project manager and of

00:46:07,249 --> 00:46:12,650
course the leaders of that the Cape Town

00:46:10,099 --> 00:46:14,989
team are I would never allow us to take

00:46:12,650 --> 00:46:16,819
work that would be possibly work that

00:46:14,989 --> 00:46:18,710
could be done by the Zurich team so if

00:46:16,819 --> 00:46:22,069
there's a client that has a capability

00:46:18,710 --> 00:46:23,720
to get a project running with our Suri

00:46:22,069 --> 00:46:25,880
team based in Switzerland it's never a

00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:29,059
project that the Cape Town team would

00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:30,529
accept so it's clear that we all talk to

00:46:29,059 --> 00:46:32,660
each other and if there's a project

00:46:30,529 --> 00:46:34,989
coming in there's a funnel that sees

00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:37,789
like okay this is a european project

00:46:34,989 --> 00:46:40,130
zurich is gonna take it over only if

00:46:37,789 --> 00:46:42,230
they would say this is not something we

00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:43,700
want to do they don't have budget or not

00:46:42,230 --> 00:46:45,920
enough it's too small it's not

00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:47,960
interesting but maybe you want to do it

00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:49,970
in cape town then that would be the

00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:52,190
discussion so that threat is not there

00:46:49,970 --> 00:46:54,880
we're not independent companies in a way

00:46:52,190 --> 00:46:57,529
that we make fully independent decisions

00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:58,759
does that answer your question and the

00:46:57,529 --> 00:47:01,489
second part and because of the

00:46:58,759 --> 00:47:03,170
outsourcing we don't want to we're not

00:47:01,489 --> 00:47:05,390
an outsourcing company we are a global

00:47:03,170 --> 00:47:07,700
web service provider so we believe that

00:47:05,390 --> 00:47:09,739
we need global presence and the fact

00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:11,720
that we are present in South Africa and

00:47:09,739 --> 00:47:12,170
that we have lower costs there doesn't

00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:14,599
mean that

00:47:12,170 --> 00:47:16,460
we are an outsourcing company there we

00:47:14,599 --> 00:47:18,859
have global presences all over the world

00:47:16,460 --> 00:47:21,770
and we try to follow a strategy of

00:47:18,859 --> 00:47:23,809
course optimizing costs if we can so I

00:47:21,770 --> 00:47:25,609
would never consider us selling us as an

00:47:23,809 --> 00:47:27,020
outsourcing company and I also don't

00:47:25,609 --> 00:47:29,000
think we would be perceived to that

00:47:27,020 --> 00:47:31,960
because mainly we have local teams

00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:34,819
working for local projects and if we can

00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:37,369
get a large project some overflow

00:47:34,819 --> 00:47:39,500
working from another location that is

00:47:37,369 --> 00:47:41,329
cheaper that totally makes sense but I

00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:42,700
must also say that right now we have a

00:47:41,329 --> 00:47:45,500
case where the opposite is happening

00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:47,990
Austin is very very busy and they needed

00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:50,180
capacities from other people and they

00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:51,619
now are drawing capacities from Zurich

00:47:50,180 --> 00:47:53,510
because they need lots of back-end

00:47:51,619 --> 00:47:55,760
capacity and we happen to be able to

00:47:53,510 --> 00:47:57,440
give that to them that is nice because

00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:59,799
we don't have to then hire a new person

00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:02,420
we can on a short-term optimize our

00:47:59,799 --> 00:48:04,069
capacity planning even if it's maybe not

00:48:02,420 --> 00:48:05,540
the most efficient thing on a long term

00:48:04,069 --> 00:48:09,460
because the rates are different on a

00:48:05,540 --> 00:48:13,390
short-term it might really make sense

00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:16,309
does that answer your question kind of

00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:19,900
are there any more questions any more

00:48:16,309 --> 00:48:24,260
comments any more experiences to share

00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:25,700
if not I'll guess we'll close and yeah

00:48:24,260 --> 00:48:27,740
we're still on time I think time enough

00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:29,059
to get a coffee and to move to the next

00:48:27,740 --> 00:48:30,380
session thanks very much for listening

00:48:29,059 --> 00:48:32,829
and enjoy the rest of the conference

00:48:30,380 --> 00:48:32,829
