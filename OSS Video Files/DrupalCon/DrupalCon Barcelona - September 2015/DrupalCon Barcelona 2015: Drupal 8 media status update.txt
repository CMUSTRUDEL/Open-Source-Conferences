Title: DrupalCon Barcelona 2015: Drupal 8 media status update
Publication date: 2015-09-22
Playlist: DrupalCon Barcelona - September 2015
Description: 
	The Drupal 8 Contrib Media Team is making good progress on our master plan for media handling in Drupal 8. We'd like to share what we've done so far, what is left to do, and how everything fits together into the vision we have for D8 Media. 

Specific things we'd like to have a conversation about with the D8 core and contrib developers:

How can we solve contrib library dependencies? We're using Composer for Drupal Core but we also include all of our external libraries in Core itself. Should contrib do the same?
What, if anything should we propose to improve the media handling support for Drupal 8 core before release? What could we include in the 8.x.x minor releases? What needs to wait for Drupal 9?
What needs have we not considered or need to meet?

well just a note session that is on the

00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:10,080
printed schedule for this room in this

00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,580
slot won't be happening so if anybody

00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,700
came for that session you're in the

00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:18,139
wrong room if you are here for this

00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:18,139
session then you're in the right room

00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:25,800
okay do you know if there's a lot of

00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:30,060
people still coming from lunch or okay

00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:33,130
hello everybody welcome to session about

00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:39,580
progress of media initiative for Drupal

00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:43,360
8 my name is llanes my panel and all

00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:48,610
various internet things and drupal org

00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:51,390
and Twitter and all that is / RSM first

00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:54,790
I owe you an apology I had a last-minute

00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:58,050
problem with my slides so I'm not used

00:01:54,790 --> 00:02:00,850
to completely up-to-date version I

00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:03,820
pulled down thing that was on github

00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:06,340
because we are storing these slides

00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:08,350
publicly because mostly Dave and myself

00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:11,250
are working together on them and then

00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:14,440
giving this same talk on various events

00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:16,480
but more or less everything except my

00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:22,050
presentation and my name should be on it

00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:26,040
I hope you know it will apologize me I

00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:31,090
am a software engineer from Slovenia

00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:38,170
it's a small country next to Italy and

00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:42,480
under Austria to give you an idea I work

00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:46,180
at examiner com examiner is one of the

00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:48,580
biggest Drupal websites we do fun stuff

00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:53,020
we handle a lot of traffic we create a

00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:54,730
lot of content we use which is

00:02:53,020 --> 00:03:01,000
probably not very common in our

00:02:54,730 --> 00:03:03,520
community and we also recently started

00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:07,620
to share our content with various

00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:13,480
different destinations in inside our

00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:15,370
main our mother corporation and to solve

00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:19,660
that problem properly we started to work

00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:22,570
on publishing platform that will feed

00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:24,520
all these sites with content and we

00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:27,160
decided to go with Drupal 8 so

00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:32,530
lot of stuff that I've been doing

00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:35,170
related to media is during my work time

00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:39,160
at examiner because we're we need these

00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:41,680
two so just like a small note and thank

00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:43,750
you for to my employer to allow me to do

00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,120
that because sometimes I work on things

00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:57,640
that are not strictly necessary for what

00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:59,830
we need okay so first thing our slides

00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:03,010
budget 07 what we have in Drupal 7 at

00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:05,350
the moment we have five fields and image

00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:09,390
fields you're probably all familiar with

00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:12,310
that and there are a lot of limitations

00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:15,460
files are limited to fields you cannot

00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:18,400
reuse files Cora will automatically

00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:24,010
delete files for you if you read a note

00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:26,200
that this file was uploaded to you

00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:29,320
cannot make files feel double etc but

00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:32,530
then we have few contributors that

00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:34,930
improve that we have file entity that

00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:37,330
which brings you possibility to add

00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:40,930
field of the files which allows you to

00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:43,240
add metadata then we have fine lock

00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:45,850
which will prevent files from being

00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:48,430
automatically deleted because if you

00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:52,810
install one of the modules like media

00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:55,990
that extend core files with possibility

00:04:52,810 --> 00:05:01,800
to reuse them then you certainly don't

00:04:55,990 --> 00:05:05,410
want too fast to be gone a bit early

00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:09,580
then we have few extension modules that

00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:12,250
allow you to embed remote media we have

00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:15,010
integration with ckeditor and back port

00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:20,650
of entity in bed which I will tell more

00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:23,730
about later and there is also a scarred

00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:29,250
module and few other other modules that

00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:31,210
basically do the same job by

00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:33,580
implementing everything from scratch

00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:38,660
like scarred could be compared to media

00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:41,480
and solutions around media feature wise

00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:43,700
but it doesn't share any code and this

00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:45,830
is one of the problems that we have in

00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:49,610
Drupal 7 we have a lot of competing

00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:52,610
solutions that don't cooperate it's

00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:58,040
impossible to mix them to integrate them

00:05:52,610 --> 00:06:02,930
and in my view this is huge waste of

00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:11,480
resources okay let's see what we have in

00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:14,300
Drupal 8 core we finally have embedding

00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:16,520
in WYSIWYG because you all probably know

00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:19,070
that we have visit week in Drupal core

00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:21,500
by default now and one of the features

00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:25,730
that come with core WYSIWYG is embedding

00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:27,830
of images in the WYSIWYG area it works

00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:30,620
quite nice you can also add captions you

00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:33,110
can define alignment if you move this

00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:35,210
image around caption follows you he

00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:39,020
doesn't stay where in the image was

00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:41,930
initially positioned so it does pretty

00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:46,730
good job the only limitation that we

00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:48,770
have is that we cannot reuse files that

00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:51,910
are already in the system we have to

00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:56,330
upload a file every time when we do this

00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:59,510
it will also track file usage so if you

00:06:56,330 --> 00:07:02,330
try to delete a file and you are

00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:04,640
embedding it somewhere in some with a

00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:06,620
weak area Drupal won't allow you to do

00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:08,720
that because it will know that it's used

00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:11,810
somewhere and it will also tell you

00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:14,900
where which is nice and this is

00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:17,570
something that competing solutions which

00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:20,960
we often compare us with don't have as

00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:23,270
far as I know then we have very basic

00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:25,250
file listing you will see all the files

00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:29,180
that are in the system that were

00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:31,730
uploaded using file or image fields you

00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:36,190
get basic information you can filter

00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:40,880
this it's a view so you can modify it

00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:45,320
but it's not a media library as you

00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:47,210
would expect it you can use it to to

00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,529
organize files to change them or

00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:50,319
anything

00:07:47,529 --> 00:07:52,869
like that it's just the listing and we

00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:57,009
also have this another view which will

00:07:52,869 --> 00:07:58,569
list all the usages of a file to solve

00:07:57,009 --> 00:08:01,359
exactly that problem that I explained

00:07:58,569 --> 00:08:03,399
earlier with week if file is used in a

00:08:01,359 --> 00:08:08,229
WYSIWYG field somewhere you will see it

00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:09,969
there we also made the automatic clean

00:08:08,229 --> 00:08:16,089
up configurable so now it's much easier

00:08:09,969 --> 00:08:18,129
to to override that because in Drupal 7

00:08:16,089 --> 00:08:21,159
we needed another module we had to fight

00:08:18,129 --> 00:08:23,379
that now in Drupal 8 we just have a

00:08:21,159 --> 00:08:27,849
simple configuration value which we can

00:08:23,379 --> 00:08:29,469
set and either make this period after

00:08:27,849 --> 00:08:41,019
which files will be real it longer or

00:08:29,469 --> 00:08:44,529
completely disable it so we fixed file

00:08:41,019 --> 00:08:47,649
deletion we have WYSIWYG we can embed

00:08:44,529 --> 00:08:50,290
images in WYSIWYG but we can't embed

00:08:47,649 --> 00:08:54,550
anything else we still cannot reuse

00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:56,829
files or we cannot field files we cannot

00:08:54,550 --> 00:09:01,449
make them feel double so it's hard for

00:08:56,829 --> 00:09:03,639
us to help metadata and it's still

00:09:01,449 --> 00:09:07,689
limited to fields we don't have media

00:09:03,639 --> 00:09:09,639
library or anything like that files are

00:09:07,689 --> 00:09:14,439
entities but are not full-featured

00:09:09,639 --> 00:09:17,709
entities as as you would expect and you

00:09:14,439 --> 00:09:21,699
will say only that it's like I have you

00:09:17,709 --> 00:09:24,939
been doing all five years in it's partly

00:09:21,699 --> 00:09:27,009
true we spent a lot of time at the

00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:32,740
beginning of the release cycle with

00:09:27,009 --> 00:09:37,620
planning and also arguing a bit but at

00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:40,809
New York camp 2014 we came together

00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:43,089
organizers did a very good job of

00:09:40,809 --> 00:09:45,610
bringing everybody there on site and

00:09:43,089 --> 00:09:48,550
they locked us in a room and said sit

00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:54,120
down and stay in there until you come

00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:57,209
with a solution which actually happened

00:09:54,120 --> 00:10:00,660
we came with a plan

00:09:57,209 --> 00:10:04,529
and the most important thing that we

00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:07,319
decided there which maybe sounds like

00:10:04,529 --> 00:10:09,480
something minor but conceptually is

00:10:07,319 --> 00:10:12,689
completely different than what we had

00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:14,579
before its creation of smaller

00:10:12,689 --> 00:10:18,209
independent components that are you

00:10:14,579 --> 00:10:20,459
reusable and pluggable which means now

00:10:18,209 --> 00:10:24,679
we can have different competing media

00:10:20,459 --> 00:10:27,889
solutions that will be reusing same

00:10:24,679 --> 00:10:31,230
smaller pieces which means collaboration

00:10:27,889 --> 00:10:38,069
which means less less waste of resources

00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:40,019
last waste of our time and that was the

00:10:38,069 --> 00:10:43,470
main achievement like instead of having

00:10:40,019 --> 00:10:47,879
media and scowled we decided to have

00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:51,439
smaller components oriented at very

00:10:47,879 --> 00:10:57,029
specific tasks like storing files

00:10:51,439 --> 00:10:59,999
embedding files in WYSIWYG picking files

00:10:57,029 --> 00:11:02,279
to be reused somewhere so these are all

00:10:59,999 --> 00:11:05,910
smaller problems that are currently in

00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:08,339
the seven solved in big pieces and in d8

00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:12,540
we're solving them in smaller modules

00:11:08,339 --> 00:11:18,540
that can be reused among different

00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:21,329
competing solutions and another

00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:24,329
attribution to nice camp organizers this

00:11:21,329 --> 00:11:28,470
year one year after this first meeting

00:11:24,329 --> 00:11:31,040
they did very good job of you know

00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:34,499
fighting us everyone to New York again

00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:36,629
where we had a sprint for week which

00:11:34,499 --> 00:11:43,639
helped us push for helped us push

00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:43,639
forward a lot of things and here we are

00:11:43,699 --> 00:11:48,869
first independent component which I

00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:51,629
already mentioned with the seven it's

00:11:48,869 --> 00:11:55,019
entity in bed it's a module that that

00:11:51,629 --> 00:11:59,660
that solves embedding just any entity

00:11:55,019 --> 00:12:03,059
not just file entities in two ways awake

00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:08,720
it's currently in quite good shape you

00:12:03,059 --> 00:12:10,649
can use it we still have to improve UX

00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:14,129
we still

00:12:10,649 --> 00:12:16,290
have plans how to abstract it and it was

00:12:14,129 --> 00:12:19,860
also partly backported to Drupal service

00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:21,449
so you can you can also use it there we

00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:23,009
still have to integrate it with entity

00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:30,179
browser which is another component I

00:12:23,009 --> 00:12:32,519
will explain later and it looks like

00:12:30,179 --> 00:12:36,029
this this you configure different embed

00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:38,759
buttons each button is responsible for

00:12:36,029 --> 00:12:41,730
one entity type in this case we

00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:46,170
configured button for files are able to

00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:48,209
see this so at the top it says file and

00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:50,129
then from drop down you basically picked

00:12:48,209 --> 00:12:53,100
which entity type your button will be

00:12:50,129 --> 00:12:55,259
responsible to and this is most

00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:57,480
important at this point then you can

00:12:55,259 --> 00:12:59,670
also define which I can will be used

00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:03,629
with this button when you actually see

00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:05,550
it in the WYSIWYG toolbar and which for

00:13:03,629 --> 00:13:07,259
matters can be used with it and things

00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:09,540
like that but the most important part is

00:13:07,259 --> 00:13:14,850
you define a button and find which

00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:19,230
entity type this button works with and

00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:22,620
then when you click on this button when

00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:25,170
working with WYSIWYG editor you get this

00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:26,790
page and this is basically the

00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:29,730
autocomplete fields that you are

00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:32,910
familiar with from let's say tagging

00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:36,149
with taxonomy terms you will it will

00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:39,120
search for for an entity in this case

00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:43,439
for this file for this kiss forgive gif

00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:46,470
file and then you will be able to define

00:13:43,439 --> 00:13:49,589
which for matters to you which formatter

00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:54,629
to use for display and configuration for

00:13:49,589 --> 00:13:57,299
that for matter and then you also you

00:13:54,629 --> 00:13:59,009
can find how to align it like everything

00:13:57,299 --> 00:14:02,730
that you know from course image

00:13:59,009 --> 00:14:07,639
embedding and here it is and then you

00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:11,699
can edit it again you can move it around

00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:13,889
so it works very similar to course

00:14:11,699 --> 00:14:16,470
imogen bed except it supports just any

00:14:13,889 --> 00:14:19,199
entity you can embed the economy terms

00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:21,420
in two nodes or knows internodes you can

00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:22,660
do crazy things that but we're not

00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:29,500
responsible if you just

00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:33,190
things and it also works in a very clean

00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:37,410
way it's just one HTML attribute its

00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:42,009
custom Drupal's attribute with few data

00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:44,920
arguments they define which entity type

00:14:42,009 --> 00:14:48,790
is that which entity type you which

00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:52,060
entity uuid is it and configuration for

00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:57,670
formatter and then when rendering your

00:14:52,060 --> 00:15:00,910
content text filter takes this and

00:14:57,670 --> 00:15:07,990
transforms it into a rendered version of

00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:11,649
your entity so it won't persist look and

00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:13,810
feel of the entity that you that you

00:15:11,649 --> 00:15:16,600
embedded in here if you change the

00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:19,209
template later it will respect that new

00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:20,980
template which is very important if you

00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:23,680
embed something and it's tastes like

00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:25,899
this forever you come to a point when

00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:28,600
you want to redesign your page all your

00:15:25,899 --> 00:15:31,000
embed stay the same which ends up being

00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:37,509
very ugly with this solution it will

00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:41,670
also follow you when you do redesigns we

00:15:37,509 --> 00:15:45,180
are also working on embed API it's

00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:48,639
abstraction of the entity and bad module

00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:51,880
it's module that will provide foundation

00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:53,680
for various embed modules one of them is

00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:57,339
entity embed which I just show to you

00:15:53,680 --> 00:16:00,130
but then we also have URL in bed which

00:15:57,339 --> 00:16:02,439
works with URLs if you want to embed

00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:05,439
let's say a YouTube video you can just

00:16:02,439 --> 00:16:09,370
use URL of that video and you are Alan

00:16:05,439 --> 00:16:14,170
bet with some plugins should be able to

00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:17,470
handle that for you and we're also

00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:20,290
planning to work on short coin shortage

00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:24,819
or embed which is something similar like

00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:28,959
in some forms you had some short codes

00:16:24,819 --> 00:16:34,449
which would then translate into some

00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:37,239
kind of larger markup would allow you to

00:16:34,449 --> 00:16:43,329
pre-defined different pieces that you

00:16:37,239 --> 00:16:45,189
can reuse and things like that then next

00:16:43,329 --> 00:16:48,939
component is entity browser which I

00:16:45,189 --> 00:16:53,919
already mentioned before entity browser

00:16:48,939 --> 00:16:59,829
is responsible for creating displaying

00:16:53,919 --> 00:17:04,630
and selecting content that you need to

00:16:59,829 --> 00:17:06,909
reuse in some other place let's say when

00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:10,059
we integrate this with the embedding

00:17:06,909 --> 00:17:14,380
solution instead of having that ugly

00:17:10,059 --> 00:17:17,350
autocomplete field we put entity browser

00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:21,250
in there and then entity browser allows

00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:24,819
you to open a modal or something similar

00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:29,110
where you get list of files that are in

00:17:24,819 --> 00:17:31,750
your system and when you pick those

00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:34,240
files and it abroad browser takes care

00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:36,789
about communicating information about

00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:42,549
these files to the embedding solution

00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:45,960
which then knows how to use them of

00:17:42,549 --> 00:17:48,760
course we want to use views inside it

00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:51,010
because views essentially provides all

00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:53,710
sorts of listings and media library for

00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:56,250
example it's just another listing but

00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:59,799
it's not limited to that like you can

00:17:56,250 --> 00:18:03,000
have totally custom uploader solution

00:17:59,799 --> 00:18:06,070
where you just drag and drop images and

00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:09,580
system uploads them and create file

00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:12,130
entities for you or anything else like

00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:14,620
we also integrated within in an entity

00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:17,679
form so you can open an entity browser

00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:19,149
and then the inline entity form will

00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:23,169
appear so you can actually create

00:18:19,149 --> 00:18:29,830
another entity in the same window in the

00:18:23,169 --> 00:18:32,889
same feeling touch it's quite a complex

00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:37,210
solution but we hope that when when it's

00:18:32,889 --> 00:18:39,899
done it will allow us to do very

00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:39,899
interesting things

00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:54,120
yeah but it's kind of usable at the

00:18:49,809 --> 00:18:58,929
moment we are using it in our pop two

00:18:54,120 --> 00:19:00,909
main main constraint that we have at the

00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:04,360
moment is that there is no configuration

00:19:00,909 --> 00:19:07,480
you I so if you know what you're doing

00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:09,100
you can heck yeah more files which are

00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:12,100
basically configuration for entity

00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:13,630
browsers and if you know how to do that

00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:15,970
you can actually achieve a lot of things

00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:18,880
if you don't know how to do that then

00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:21,279
there is no UI that will help you but

00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:24,309
we're always happy if you want to

00:19:21,279 --> 00:19:26,380
experiment with it you can you can you

00:19:24,309 --> 00:19:29,860
can ping us and we will try to help

00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:33,340
there is also a module that that comes

00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:35,140
with some example configurations which

00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:36,580
you can use as a starting point it's

00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:40,809
called entity browser example and it

00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:42,700
leaves in the same repository let's see

00:19:40,809 --> 00:19:46,570
how it works so we have a very basic

00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:49,360
note here with title and one entity

00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:54,130
reference field when we click on this

00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:56,860
button we open the entity browser and we

00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:59,140
have to so called widgets in this

00:19:56,860 --> 00:20:03,610
browser one is uploader and the other

00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:07,080
one is library so we currently uploaded

00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:09,669
few images using drop zone jas library

00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:14,860
which allows to do drag and drop things

00:20:09,669 --> 00:20:17,130
and nice phase experiences like that and

00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:21,460
then in the other widget we have a view

00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:24,309
which displays existing images in the

00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:26,590
system and we created our let's say

00:20:24,309 --> 00:20:29,740
slideshow in two steps we uploaded few

00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:33,549
images and then we went into entity

00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:36,070
browser again and use few other images

00:20:33,549 --> 00:20:41,950
that were already in the system so this

00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:49,360
is perfectly possible to do we are using

00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:51,970
this on our on our project there are of

00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:54,340
course a lot of bugs and a lot of things

00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:57,150
that need to be improved but I

00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:57,150
it's a very good start

00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:11,440
okay then we have another module which

00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:14,260
is called inline entity form but what's

00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:18,250
that like isn't in an entity form drupal

00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:19,420
commerce stuff of course it is but we

00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:22,480
said that we want to collaborate

00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:25,120
collaborate and we are not limiting

00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:27,910
ourselves just to modules that are

00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:30,550
created as part of media initiative but

00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:34,240
we're also looking around and trying to

00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:38,080
identify modules that will work for us

00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:40,720
too and in an entity form is an example

00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:44,560
of of a module that was created for

00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:48,390
Drupal commerce but it's done in a very

00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:51,730
general way which allows you to use it

00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:54,550
like in a lot of other situations and

00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:57,310
this is exactly what we want to do with

00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:59,680
our components we are not limiting our

00:21:57,310 --> 00:22:02,800
component just to media use cases you

00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:06,370
can use embed solution or entity browser

00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:09,190
solution for any other problem like you

00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:10,990
can you can use entity browser to search

00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:13,270
for related content that you want to

00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:17,100
link to the content that you are

00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:17,100
currently working on or things like that

00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:24,490
together with maintainer zuv in an

00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:26,470
entity form we spend a lot of time to

00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:30,640
port it and it's very usable at the

00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:33,520
moment it has entity browser integration

00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:35,110
which means if you are familiar with in

00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:38,710
an entity form you know that you have

00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:42,070
this possibility to create entities in

00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:43,900
line or two reference existing entities

00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:47,380
and where your reference existing

00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:51,880
entities they display an autocomplete

00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:55,180
field we now swap this and display any

00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:58,240
the browser instead of that so you can

00:22:55,180 --> 00:23:03,250
use entity browser to reference existing

00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:05,860
entities for inland entity form it still

00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:08,290
needs some cleanup i guess and we

00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:12,760
would like to have more tests in it but

00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:17,760
it's very usable so if you have use

00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:23,310
cases where this comes useful

00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:25,740
you should really take a look at it this

00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:30,870
will be similar example than what I

00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:34,140
showed previously instead so instead of

00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:36,890
having this very basic list of files we

00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:42,990
swapped that with the in an entity form

00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:48,330
which makes it even nicer so we can

00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:52,410
create photo media entity within an

00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:56,180
entity form and then we see this

00:23:52,410 --> 00:24:00,360
familiar table that we also had in in

00:23:56,180 --> 00:24:05,360
indy 7 and then here below you can see

00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:09,030
that we opened the entity browser it's

00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:12,120
it's this entity browser that swapped

00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:16,800
the autocomplete field and now we are

00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:19,140
uploading few more files and we should

00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:21,690
probably scroll this up a little bit and

00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:23,820
when files are uploaded upload widget

00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:25,980
creates media entities for you and

00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:29,040
you'll get them in this table and now

00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:31,830
you can reorder them or edit them which

00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:35,370
will use inline entity form so it gets

00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:37,970
very interesting like you can mix all

00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:42,200
these different modules from Drupal

00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:50,700
ecosystem to achieve very interesting

00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:54,030
experiences then we have file entity

00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:56,280
final entity is we call it storage

00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:58,910
component it's one of the ways how to

00:24:56,280 --> 00:25:02,280
store your media how to store your files

00:24:58,910 --> 00:25:07,680
it's currently there is an unofficial

00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:12,390
port there is some planning going on how

00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:14,760
to approach this 48 maintained errs want

00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:16,500
to change its approach little bit from

00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:20,370
the seven but they don't agree on it

00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:21,780
entirely but if you want to use it on an

00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:25,190
existing Drupal site you can use

00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:29,490
unofficial port this unofficial port is

00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:31,630
already used on live web sites as far as

00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:35,770
I know so if there will be

00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:37,930
your radical change when port becomes

00:25:35,770 --> 00:25:41,140
official I guess there will be some kind

00:25:37,930 --> 00:25:45,090
of migration path but disclaimers and

00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:45,090
use it in production but listen to me

00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:54,030
then media from Drupal 7 media will be

00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:57,250
just one of the this full-featured

00:25:54,030 --> 00:26:01,210
providers of media experience as we are

00:25:57,250 --> 00:26:04,840
I tend to call it it will basically just

00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:08,410
glue all the components together it will

00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:13,960
depend to other smaller modules and come

00:26:08,410 --> 00:26:17,530
with some basic configuration and of

00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:19,570
course this can be done when components

00:26:17,530 --> 00:26:22,150
are early at least majority of

00:26:19,570 --> 00:26:27,850
components are finished so we don't have

00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:30,040
any news about that but you don't have

00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:31,810
to wait for media to be finished like

00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:36,130
you can start playing with this small

00:26:31,810 --> 00:26:39,310
components and there is quite big

00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:41,830
possibility that for at least some use

00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:44,820
cases that you might have will be enough

00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:48,460
you just have to play with configuration

00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:51,840
and and and try to put it together in a

00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:55,180
way that works for you I see these

00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:56,890
modules like media that provide just

00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:59,080
basically provide configuration and

00:26:56,890 --> 00:27:03,340
dependencies more like an example

00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:06,760
modules in indy 8 you will be able to

00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:09,100
use them but you could only use them as

00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:10,930
a reference to see how they do it and

00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:15,070
then you could do it in a slightly

00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:17,860
different way like I usually compare

00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:20,790
this to Drupal commerce which comes with

00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:23,830
a lot of modules it's huge ecosystem and

00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:26,680
you have two ways of approaching it you

00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:30,370
can use commerce kickstart distribution

00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:33,070
which brings everything together gives

00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:35,860
you a lot of default configuration so

00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:40,000
you have better feeling of what is

00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:41,790
possible but you can certainly pick just

00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,389
individual modules from the e-commerce

00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:46,419
ecosystem and

00:27:43,389 --> 00:27:49,919
your own solution without touching

00:27:46,419 --> 00:27:53,499
commerce kickstart at all and I see

00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:59,109
modules like media a kind of equivalent

00:27:53,499 --> 00:28:01,719
of commerce kickstart in our case then

00:27:59,109 --> 00:28:04,389
we have media entity module it is

00:28:01,719 --> 00:28:11,879
alternative storage solution like kind

00:28:04,389 --> 00:28:14,799
of competing with file entity it stores

00:28:11,879 --> 00:28:18,129
your media in a slightly different way

00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:20,639
it takes slightly different approach it

00:28:18,129 --> 00:28:25,149
creates a new entity type from stretch

00:28:20,639 --> 00:28:31,479
and then uses standard group of field

00:28:25,149 --> 00:28:38,619
API to do everything else it's very

00:28:31,479 --> 00:28:42,759
usable at the moment we have basic UI we

00:28:38,619 --> 00:28:47,139
have an API to to handle metadata let's

00:28:42,759 --> 00:28:48,759
say if you if you create a reference to

00:28:47,139 --> 00:28:52,329
YouTube video in your system and you

00:28:48,759 --> 00:28:54,399
want this module to to pull metadata

00:28:52,329 --> 00:28:59,289
from YouTube and store it in local

00:28:54,399 --> 00:29:01,209
fields it allows you to do that and we

00:28:59,289 --> 00:29:03,999
already have a lot of providers you can

00:29:01,209 --> 00:29:06,940
you can use it with YouTube with local

00:29:03,999 --> 00:29:09,989
files with twitter with tweets you can

00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:14,519
you can treat your tweets as your media

00:29:09,989 --> 00:29:18,369
it integrates with the Instagram and

00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:21,159
some guys are currently working on audio

00:29:18,369 --> 00:29:26,859
plugin for it and it comes with very

00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:28,389
basic media library too we still have to

00:29:26,859 --> 00:29:32,889
integrate media library with entity

00:29:28,389 --> 00:29:36,459
browser which will make library usable

00:29:32,889 --> 00:29:40,479
inside of entity browsers views which

00:29:36,459 --> 00:29:43,419
will then give you nice or nicer

00:29:40,479 --> 00:29:46,749
experience when searching the the

00:29:43,419 --> 00:29:50,940
existing media items in your in your

00:29:46,749 --> 00:29:54,159
system like video that I showed earlier

00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:56,830
had a simple table with thumbnails and

00:29:54,159 --> 00:30:01,450
checkboxes so this is kind of

00:29:56,830 --> 00:30:04,809
improvement and on top of that we also

00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:06,940
missed some configuration you I with

00:30:04,809 --> 00:30:09,190
this module two we have some but not

00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:11,409
everything can be done in you I so if

00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:13,750
you really have to want to play with it

00:30:11,409 --> 00:30:19,840
you will have to have Yama files at the

00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:22,269
moment and we don't handle any rendering

00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:25,630
at the moment but since this is very

00:30:22,269 --> 00:30:28,990
standard Drupal entity with reusing

00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:31,500
standard Drupal files fields like file

00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:35,860
field or image fields and you can

00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:38,260
configure your rendering to some extent

00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:44,830
with just with stuff that comes with

00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:49,570
core and it also comes with like

00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:52,179
validation API that will let's say if

00:30:49,570 --> 00:30:54,840
you want to if you want to create a

00:30:52,179 --> 00:31:01,600
piece of media in our case to tweet and

00:30:54,840 --> 00:31:08,169
you you copy URL or an embed code of a

00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:12,929
tweet that you want to use and then if

00:31:08,169 --> 00:31:18,549
you if you do a typo when copying this

00:31:12,929 --> 00:31:20,620
let's do a typo validation will kick in

00:31:18,549 --> 00:31:24,029
and it won't allow you to save that

00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:26,470
because it will detect that this isn't

00:31:24,029 --> 00:31:30,970
actually a reference to an existing

00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:34,899
tweet even if it looks like one but when

00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:37,360
we fix that typo we save it and then you

00:31:34,899 --> 00:31:41,429
will see that we have two other fields

00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:44,169
called tweet content and retweet count

00:31:41,429 --> 00:31:47,710
which is now filled in automatically for

00:31:44,169 --> 00:31:50,500
you because i define mapping and told

00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:53,320
media entity to fetch this information

00:31:50,500 --> 00:32:00,940
from twitter's api and to save it in the

00:31:53,320 --> 00:32:03,309
field for me so i can use it locally and

00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:05,890
we also have media pinkeye module which

00:32:03,309 --> 00:32:11,560
is not a disease

00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:14,560
and it's like first let's say usable

00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:18,030
example of a full-featured solution it's

00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:22,360
a module that depends on media entity

00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:24,280
and comes with some basic configuration

00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:26,560
and if you want to play with media

00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:29,680
entity you can just download this

00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:32,530
install it and you will get a lot of

00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:37,960
default configuration which you can use

00:32:32,530 --> 00:32:43,600
to explore and learn and then we also

00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:47,680
have crop API it's a very basic module

00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:52,290
that tries to provide very basic ap is

00:32:47,680 --> 00:33:00,310
for cropping tools it gives you storage

00:32:52,290 --> 00:33:02,560
which is using entity API it's not using

00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:05,680
custom tables like solutions in d7 did

00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:07,900
we have entities now and it is it is

00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:10,840
designed in a way that can handle like

00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:13,800
both of most common approaches that we

00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:17,350
have in cropping world one being

00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:19,960
defining an area which you want to crop

00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:22,810
and the other one being just defining a

00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:27,910
focal point so this storage mechanism is

00:33:22,810 --> 00:33:31,570
able to store both of them and then it

00:33:27,910 --> 00:33:33,880
also comes with with few basic image

00:33:31,570 --> 00:33:35,920
effects which you can use then to define

00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:37,630
your image styles that will be using

00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:40,780
this crop information there is no you

00:33:37,630 --> 00:33:45,400
are yet and we won't be adding any new

00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:48,580
eyes to this module what we're hoping is

00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:50,980
that people will be using this storage

00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:54,880
component when they will start working

00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:59,620
on their their you eyes and the biggest

00:33:54,880 --> 00:34:03,640
benefit we see here is like you I is

00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:06,370
very subjective thing you like I like

00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:09,130
one solution and somebody else likes

00:34:06,370 --> 00:34:11,409
another solution and it may also happen

00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:14,590
that you start with something and then

00:34:11,409 --> 00:34:17,440
you don't like it anymore and you want

00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:18,040
to switch to something else that looks a

00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:22,990
little bit different

00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:25,450
if all the crop you eyes will be reusing

00:34:22,990 --> 00:34:28,690
same storage component you can just swap

00:34:25,450 --> 00:34:33,250
them because the date that it is stored

00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:37,240
underneath stays the same and we also

00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:38,620
save some work because not every crop

00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:41,770
solution will have to re-implement

00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:45,970
storage and image effects over and over

00:34:41,770 --> 00:34:50,200
again and there are already some people

00:34:45,970 --> 00:34:51,790
working on you I parts of it so we are

00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:55,660
seeing some traction there which makes

00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:58,480
me very happy then we have drops on jes

00:34:55,660 --> 00:35:01,330
integration drop zone GS is the

00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:03,430
drag-and-drop uploader tool that you saw

00:35:01,330 --> 00:35:06,700
in one of the screencasts actually in

00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:11,950
two of the spring tests it is using drop

00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:15,310
zone GS library and our integration

00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:17,740
module initially provides form element

00:35:15,310 --> 00:35:20,080
which means you can use drop zone for

00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:23,890
any form if you have a completely custom

00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:27,400
form for whatever use case you have you

00:35:23,890 --> 00:35:29,140
can use drop zone there and then we have

00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:32,700
entity browser integration on top of

00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:37,030
that which is what you saw in action

00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:39,910
previously we still have to integrate it

00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:43,450
with core image and file fields and

00:35:39,910 --> 00:35:47,910
we're hoping that we'll be able to do

00:35:43,450 --> 00:35:52,180
this sooner rather than later one of our

00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:54,820
members is already working on this and

00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:58,170
then we need to do some cleanup and

00:35:54,820 --> 00:36:00,610
tests and I think this will be

00:35:58,170 --> 00:36:04,060
everything that this model with module

00:36:00,610 --> 00:36:06,910
it will provide but since it gives you a

00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:09,040
very basic form element you would be

00:36:06,910 --> 00:36:13,870
able to do a lot of interesting things

00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:17,530
with it this is drop zones web page and

00:36:13,870 --> 00:36:20,260
you already seen how it works it creates

00:36:17,530 --> 00:36:24,310
an area where you can drop files and it

00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:25,960
will upload them I synchronously or if

00:36:24,310 --> 00:36:28,510
you don't like drag and drop you can

00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:33,150
just click on this area and it will open

00:36:28,510 --> 00:36:36,520
open file browser browser for you and I

00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:39,840
hope that this will be replacement for

00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:43,690
blood load module in the eighth because

00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:46,900
blood load comes with a lot of extra

00:36:43,690 --> 00:36:49,840
weight it has different backends it

00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:52,900
comes with html5 back end with flash

00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:55,930
back end with silver life back end and I

00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:58,510
think we are in the times where we

00:36:55,930 --> 00:37:00,970
hopefully don't need that anymore this

00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:06,100
is purely html5 so it's much cleaner

00:37:00,970 --> 00:37:08,800
it's much nicer to work with then we

00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:12,490
also have for back for matter which is

00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:17,140
basically a field for matter that allows

00:37:12,490 --> 00:37:19,090
you to create priority list of for

00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:21,580
matters that might be usable for your

00:37:19,090 --> 00:37:27,480
field and then first of them which will

00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:31,420
return useful content will will be used

00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:35,410
one usage for this would be a field

00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:37,840
where your reference videos and you have

00:37:35,410 --> 00:37:41,500
few videos from YouTube few videos from

00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:46,000
Vimeo few local ones and you can't use

00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:48,490
one for matter for for everything so you

00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:50,320
would use fullback for meter and then

00:37:48,490 --> 00:37:53,140
tell for look for matter that you want

00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:58,240
to use either youtube for matter Vimeo

00:37:53,140 --> 00:38:01,090
or local video 11 and then fall back for

00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:03,700
matter will be able to determine which

00:38:01,090 --> 00:38:06,400
one of them should be used for a

00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:14,470
specific item that you have uploaded

00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:17,680
uploaded or created then we also i think

00:38:14,470 --> 00:38:20,440
this module already exists 47 it's the

00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:24,580
name planning for d8 i believe and it's

00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:26,440
basically reusing of for matters for

00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:29,800
image fields five fields and entity

00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:32,170
reference fields like currently in

00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:34,420
Drupal core you have special formative

00:38:32,170 --> 00:38:37,360
for file field and special formatting

00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:39,370
for image field and sometimes you would

00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:41,270
like to reuse them for whatever reason

00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:45,290
because both both fields say

00:38:41,270 --> 00:38:47,690
Ashley store files reference to a file

00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:53,630
and this module will allow you to mix

00:38:47,690 --> 00:38:55,430
that then also file download module

00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:59,180
which will be responsible for

00:38:55,430 --> 00:39:10,030
downloading files serving files sorry

00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:13,850
and logging that so where are we we we

00:39:10,030 --> 00:39:17,030
stayed with the plan that we will stick

00:39:13,850 --> 00:39:19,370
to smaller components and especially the

00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:21,920
example of inter- form shows how

00:39:19,370 --> 00:39:24,020
successful this is like if we wouldn't

00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:28,790
go down that route we could never use

00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:31,100
inline entity form for for media cases

00:39:28,790 --> 00:39:35,060
but now we can and we've seen that it

00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:40,210
works we built momentum to some extent

00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:40,210
we would still love to see more momentum

00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:50,720
I did notice that recently when Drupal 8

00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:53,300
itself is approaching state where people

00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:55,430
will have courage to use it more and

00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:59,600
more people started to send emails to

00:39:55,430 --> 00:40:03,170
paying on IRC asking questions trying to

00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:05,930
play with components and we've been

00:40:03,170 --> 00:40:11,030
trying to to mentor all these people and

00:40:05,930 --> 00:40:14,660
to guide them so i think that momentum

00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:17,530
is actually building it's just maybe we

00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:20,660
wished it would happen faster but

00:40:17,530 --> 00:40:28,100
sometimes you can't speed things up

00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:30,620
until they are ready we struggle with

00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:35,240
communication a little bit we don't

00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:38,030
communicate enough with the community

00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:40,640
but we have this kind of sessions but I

00:40:38,030 --> 00:40:42,950
don't think that's enough because there

00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:47,380
are tens of thousands of members of the

00:40:42,950 --> 00:40:47,380
community and they are not all in there

00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:54,280
we'll see how that continues like we try

00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:57,990
to if everyone that approach

00:40:54,280 --> 00:41:02,770
and asks for mentoring reviews

00:40:57,990 --> 00:41:05,050
suggestions we try to answer at least I

00:41:02,770 --> 00:41:07,300
can speak for myself sometimes it takes

00:41:05,050 --> 00:41:10,750
me like a few days more that I would

00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:13,330
like but we all have other things to do

00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:17,640
in our lives I am not sure what will

00:41:13,330 --> 00:41:21,850
happen if momentum grows rapidly because

00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:23,710
it's already sometimes too much of

00:41:21,850 --> 00:41:29,190
people asking things so we will have to

00:41:23,710 --> 00:41:35,520
figure out how to solve that and we are

00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:37,750
still looking for funding we had few

00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:42,970
google Summer of Code projects in the

00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:44,710
past we had one this year too which is

00:41:42,970 --> 00:41:47,910
essentially funded by google so it's

00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:51,520
kind of funding and as I already said

00:41:47,910 --> 00:41:54,370
examiner allows me and some of my

00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:56,590
colleagues to work part of our time on

00:41:54,370 --> 00:41:59,290
things that benefit the entire community

00:41:56,590 --> 00:42:05,800
but other than that I'm not aware that

00:41:59,290 --> 00:42:12,550
anyone else would be doing media on non

00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:16,270
voluntarily basis we need help that's

00:42:12,550 --> 00:42:21,670
the bottom line if you noticed with

00:42:16,270 --> 00:42:23,530
every component I also added like very

00:42:21,670 --> 00:42:26,560
rough estimation how much work is needed

00:42:23,530 --> 00:42:29,140
to complete it which is very very rough

00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:31,090
I might be completely wrong but I was

00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:33,640
just curious because we never did that

00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:35,410
before and I was just curious if we just

00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:37,390
do very rough estimations for every

00:42:35,410 --> 00:42:40,920
component and some everything together

00:42:37,390 --> 00:42:45,490
to see what the actual figure will be

00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:51,190
and when I summed up everything from

00:42:45,490 --> 00:42:54,520
previous slides it came to the around 20

00:42:51,190 --> 00:43:00,460
24 developer months which is a lot of

00:42:54,520 --> 00:43:02,110
work and it's probably we can probably

00:43:00,460 --> 00:43:05,260
predict it it will be even more because

00:43:02,110 --> 00:43:08,170
if we have very defragmented community

00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:08,710
when people can just spend an hour a

00:43:08,170 --> 00:43:10,589
month

00:43:08,710 --> 00:43:13,770
we spend a lot of time with

00:43:10,589 --> 00:43:16,720
communications so this might even go up

00:43:13,770 --> 00:43:21,099
this doesn't mean that media and v8

00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:24,310
won't be usable before that like as

00:43:21,099 --> 00:43:27,730
you've seen you can solve a lot of

00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:31,650
problems already but you know there will

00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:36,339
certainly be things that you have to

00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:38,410
work around until we invest at least

00:43:36,339 --> 00:43:40,930
this amount of time and as I said don't

00:43:38,410 --> 00:43:43,960
don't hold me on that just I was just

00:43:40,930 --> 00:43:47,950
curious and it was interesting to see a

00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:50,980
number this is a list of our

00:43:47,950 --> 00:43:54,820
contributors we are seeing more and more

00:43:50,980 --> 00:44:00,280
of them and where's there's more than

00:43:54,820 --> 00:44:02,440
one frame for pictures of all of you if

00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:05,680
you want to get involved we have a

00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:09,450
Drupal media that org page we have

00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:15,790
weekly scrum meetings on our IRC channel

00:44:09,450 --> 00:44:19,030
we have a group on groups drupal org and

00:44:15,790 --> 00:44:23,290
I would say if you follow our group it's

00:44:19,030 --> 00:44:29,140
probably the best single point source of

00:44:23,290 --> 00:44:32,950
information we we store our code on

00:44:29,140 --> 00:44:37,060
github group but we sink all our repos

00:44:32,950 --> 00:44:39,760
to project pages on drupal org so if you

00:44:37,060 --> 00:44:42,520
either go on github or look for these

00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:45,390
projects that I explained on Darrell you

00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:49,900
should find the latest version of gold

00:44:45,390 --> 00:44:52,349
and we are also using issue qs drupal

00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:55,119
drupal org ishik use for development

00:44:52,349 --> 00:44:57,580
just instead of patches we use pull

00:44:55,119 --> 00:45:00,670
requests on github because it's easier

00:44:57,580 --> 00:45:03,790
to review but all the pull request

00:45:00,670 --> 00:45:08,290
should be linked from the issues so you

00:45:03,790 --> 00:45:10,839
should have references all around and if

00:45:08,290 --> 00:45:14,290
you are shy and you don't want to expose

00:45:10,839 --> 00:45:17,260
yourself in public like an IRC or on our

00:45:14,290 --> 00:45:20,579
group you can ping day for myself

00:45:17,260 --> 00:45:25,000
directly you have any questions or

00:45:20,579 --> 00:45:27,490
concerns suggestions ideas were always

00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:32,170
happy to listen and help very happy to

00:45:27,490 --> 00:45:36,280
help we also started a Drupal 8 media

00:45:32,170 --> 00:45:40,480
guide which is on github too it's

00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:42,490
basically a kid book repository there is

00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:47,140
not a lot of useful information in there

00:45:42,490 --> 00:45:51,210
yet but it's it's improving and we want

00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:55,060
to this to be the the main source of

00:45:51,210 --> 00:46:00,210
information for Drupal 8 media in

00:45:55,060 --> 00:46:03,280
general mmm we have a sprint on Friday

00:46:00,210 --> 00:46:05,859
where are also sprinting to some extent

00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:09,640
during the week and we will have a

00:46:05,859 --> 00:46:13,030
sprint at bat camp so if you are if you

00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:16,359
want to help come to me on Friday or if

00:46:13,030 --> 00:46:22,030
you are in berkeley end of next month

00:46:16,359 --> 00:46:28,500
you're also invited to join us i will

00:46:22,030 --> 00:46:32,250
also like to mention Aaron he was a very

00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:37,420
very important drupal media contributor

00:46:32,250 --> 00:46:41,160
so and we always succeed standing on

00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:46,960
giant shoulders and he he was our giant

00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:51,730
so if your he was diagnosed with with

00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:56,920
ALS and he passed away this year but now

00:46:51,730 --> 00:47:02,050
we are we have this yearly Aaron women

00:46:56,920 --> 00:47:06,940
awards to respect his memory so take

00:47:02,050 --> 00:47:09,329
care and thank you and if you have any

00:47:06,940 --> 00:47:09,329
questions

00:47:16,770 --> 00:47:26,020
there's a microphone so because our

00:47:20,830 --> 00:47:31,570
sessions are recorded you have to have

00:47:26,020 --> 00:47:34,090
to speak into it hi there um so I see

00:47:31,570 --> 00:47:37,120
that you were typing in different

00:47:34,090 --> 00:47:38,710
languages and how it do you know if

00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:41,920
anybody is using this on a multilingual

00:47:38,710 --> 00:47:48,070
enabled site yet with this meaning like

00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:51,460
the group of media tools I suspect there

00:47:48,070 --> 00:47:58,120
are but I don't have any first-hand

00:47:51,460 --> 00:48:03,280
information company called md systems

00:47:58,120 --> 00:48:08,050
from Zurich they I think they have quite

00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:10,060
a big website media website on d 8 and

00:48:08,050 --> 00:48:11,770
i'm not sure but i suspect since its

00:48:10,060 --> 00:48:13,870
switzerland and they have three

00:48:11,770 --> 00:48:19,210
languages it might be a smooth lingual

00:48:13,870 --> 00:48:23,400
but amateur like you can ask better I

00:48:19,210 --> 00:48:30,280
think Sasha barely he's in Barcelona so

00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:33,070
are you ask him great thank you okay

00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:34,960
great and whoever I'll talk to both of

00:48:33,070 --> 00:48:36,910
you guys then because i'm writing a

00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:39,040
Drupal 8 multilingual book and I was

00:48:36,910 --> 00:48:41,410
waiting on the status of media to tie

00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:43,600
that in so this is perfect thank you so

00:48:41,410 --> 00:48:48,010
it probably comes down to the individual

00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:51,790
components I'm not sure about file

00:48:48,010 --> 00:48:56,920
entity because I didn't use it much yet

00:48:51,790 --> 00:49:00,370
but media entity basically does

00:48:56,920 --> 00:49:05,040
everything that should be done to be

00:49:00,370 --> 00:49:08,230
multilingual friendly so you should have

00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:12,510
multilingual media entities and it's

00:49:08,230 --> 00:49:12,510
probably the same would file entity so

00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:18,920
anything else okay then thank you

00:49:16,850 --> 00:49:24,410
everyone and enjoy your you want to ask

00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:27,050
question yeah sure with the framework

00:49:24,410 --> 00:49:31,610
because you've got it at the moment is

00:49:27,050 --> 00:49:35,500
there any kind of way the on an instance

00:49:31,610 --> 00:49:40,970
basis you can kind of override metadata

00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:44,120
for familia so you've got say an image

00:49:40,970 --> 00:49:46,880
and you've got out and and and title

00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:50,300
tags as metadata and that gets reused

00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:51,590
every time you reuse that image but then

00:49:50,300 --> 00:49:53,030
you want saying this one place only to

00:49:51,590 --> 00:49:56,510
that same image but with different

00:49:53,030 --> 00:49:58,070
metadata is is that does that kind of

00:49:56,510 --> 00:50:01,550
work within the new so we don't have any

00:49:58,070 --> 00:50:07,190
special solution for that but one way

00:50:01,550 --> 00:50:10,330
you could approach this already is let's

00:50:07,190 --> 00:50:14,270
say like when you have media entity

00:50:10,330 --> 00:50:17,960
which represents a local file local

00:50:14,270 --> 00:50:20,540
image it basically uses an image field

00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:23,920
on the media entity which essentially

00:50:20,540 --> 00:50:27,410
means that you are referencing to a file

00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:29,180
core file which if you enable file

00:50:27,410 --> 00:50:33,050
entity module will be filled above so

00:50:29,180 --> 00:50:36,410
you could let's say add this metadata on

00:50:33,050 --> 00:50:39,590
this deepest level of a file and then

00:50:36,410 --> 00:50:42,850
create new instance of media entity

00:50:39,590 --> 00:50:45,320
every time when you use it and override

00:50:42,850 --> 00:50:48,970
metadata there so that could be possible

00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:54,380
and I think for this kind of use case

00:50:48,970 --> 00:50:57,530
you probably need an intermediate entity

00:50:54,380 --> 00:51:00,470
every time because otherwise I didn't

00:50:57,530 --> 00:51:02,930
see any solution that would give you

00:51:00,470 --> 00:51:05,090
this capability without that at least

00:51:02,930 --> 00:51:08,840
something that would be implemented in a

00:51:05,090 --> 00:51:11,930
sensible way and also like we have anti

00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:15,260
tapi in core and it's very very powerful

00:51:11,930 --> 00:51:20,210
so we should be using it so yeah I think

00:51:15,260 --> 00:51:22,730
like have an intermediate entity whether

00:51:20,210 --> 00:51:25,400
being media entity or anything else you

00:51:22,730 --> 00:51:26,299
could also do like a two step file

00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:29,749
entity to

00:51:26,299 --> 00:51:32,539
probably so something like that you have

00:51:29,749 --> 00:51:35,929
tools that can be used to build that

00:51:32,539 --> 00:51:42,979
there is not one click enable solution

00:51:35,929 --> 00:51:45,739
for that definitely I had talked once

00:51:42,979 --> 00:51:49,089
about a migration path from scold to

00:51:45,739 --> 00:51:52,699
Drupal 8 media what's the status on that

00:51:49,089 --> 00:51:58,670
there is none at least that I would know

00:51:52,699 --> 00:52:01,459
about okay so no glance there are plans

00:51:58,670 --> 00:52:03,679
to implement that certainly but there is

00:52:01,459 --> 00:52:08,509
nobody working on this at the moment not

00:52:03,679 --> 00:52:11,719
as far as i know but like people behind

00:52:08,509 --> 00:52:17,509
skull open web solutions firm from Paris

00:52:11,719 --> 00:52:24,309
they were represented on this discussion

00:52:17,509 --> 00:52:28,279
at nice camp last year so all this plan

00:52:24,309 --> 00:52:31,160
how to approach media nd8 was also based

00:52:28,279 --> 00:52:35,029
on feedback that they provided based on

00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:38,709
their experience with skulled so and

00:52:35,029 --> 00:52:42,259
media entity is actually inspired by

00:52:38,709 --> 00:52:44,689
scaled like it works in a very similar

00:52:42,259 --> 00:52:48,229
way than a tome entity things called do

00:52:44,689 --> 00:52:50,929
it's just extracted and leaves in a

00:52:48,229 --> 00:52:53,390
separate module so i would say that at

00:52:50,929 --> 00:52:57,739
some point some when somebody will need

00:52:53,390 --> 00:53:02,650
it will write migration path from 8am

00:52:57,739 --> 00:53:08,109
entity 67 to meet the entity in v8 and

00:53:02,650 --> 00:53:10,959
like it really comes down to the

00:53:08,109 --> 00:53:15,650
everyone works on things that they need

00:53:10,959 --> 00:53:19,099
so I can focus on things that my company

00:53:15,650 --> 00:53:21,650
needs for their own product and other

00:53:19,099 --> 00:53:25,599
people can focus on things that they

00:53:21,650 --> 00:53:30,229
need there are some people that do

00:53:25,599 --> 00:53:33,099
something just purely out of passion but

00:53:30,229 --> 00:53:37,459
that won't sustain development of

00:53:33,099 --> 00:53:39,369
solution of that scale forever so it

00:53:37,459 --> 00:53:42,049
comes down to

00:53:39,369 --> 00:53:45,170
if you need something and it's not there

00:53:42,049 --> 00:53:47,119
yet you probably have to implement it or

00:53:45,170 --> 00:53:49,970
if you're lucky you find one or two

00:53:47,119 --> 00:53:52,339
other people that need roughly the same

00:53:49,970 --> 00:53:55,190
thing and then you have to contribute it

00:53:52,339 --> 00:53:59,000
back we don't have one big commercial

00:53:55,190 --> 00:54:01,369
entity behind media initiative like we

00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:04,849
have Commerce guys behind drupal

00:54:01,369 --> 00:54:08,780
commerce so we don't have somebody who

00:54:04,849 --> 00:54:12,559
is funding the development so I guess

00:54:08,780 --> 00:54:17,119
this is the only way and that's why I

00:54:12,559 --> 00:54:19,430
think communication is one of the most

00:54:17,119 --> 00:54:21,829
important thing for our initiative

00:54:19,430 --> 00:54:28,280
because if we won't be communicating

00:54:21,829 --> 00:54:31,369
enough people won't be following like

00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:36,380
common plan when working or on their own

00:54:31,369 --> 00:54:38,030
solutions that's why I think this this

00:54:36,380 --> 00:54:46,040
will become even more important when a

00:54:38,030 --> 00:54:50,619
lot of new d8 projects will appear okay

00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:50,619
