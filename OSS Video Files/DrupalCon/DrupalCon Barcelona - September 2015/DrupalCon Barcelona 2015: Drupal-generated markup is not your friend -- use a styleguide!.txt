Title: DrupalCon Barcelona 2015: Drupal-generated markup is not your friend -- use a styleguide!
Publication date: 2015-09-22
Playlist: DrupalCon Barcelona - September 2015
Description: 
	The traditional approach of directly styling default Drupal markup is no longer a viable solution for any serious Drupal project. With the looming release of Drupal 8, abstracting our design patterns into manageable components will make upgrading our Drupal 7 themes possible without a total re-theme. By using a styleguide we can automate the process of isolating and cataloguing patterns, allowing us to iterate through the storm of rapid change happening on the front-end. Maintaining full controll of our design patterns also opens doors to experimenting with above-the-fold performance tuning and automated regression testing.

In this presentation I will discuss the pains of traditional CMS theming and highlight the benefits, challenges and processes around styleguide-driven development. I will also delve into how Drupal 8 and Twig makes the use of an automated styleguide even more valuable.

This session is built on top of a blog post I wrote on the PreviousNext website that was featured in the Weekly Drop and expands upon my coworker John Albin Wilkin's ideas on the same topic.

hey

00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:22,990

hello hello see how close I need to

00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:38,939
stand to the microphone so my name is uh

00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:42,439
I guess I'll just get started my name is

00:03:38,939 --> 00:03:47,970
Robert Cara cos i work in australia at a

00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:51,870
web agency called previousnext and yeah

00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:53,939
I'm here to talk about Drupal generated

00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:56,250
markup not being your friend and why you

00:03:53,939 --> 00:03:59,370
should use a style guide we've been

00:03:56,250 --> 00:04:03,989
using a style guide for the past I don't

00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:07,430
know two years now at previousnext and

00:04:03,989 --> 00:04:10,049
it's been you know it's really up to my

00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:12,480
theming skills i guess i guess i would

00:04:10,049 --> 00:04:15,120
said just it's been interesting using it

00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:16,500
i want to talk a little bit i heard Ruiz

00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:20,549
talked my last session i did in

00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:22,710
drupalcon austin i talked about angular

00:04:20,549 --> 00:04:27,060
and all the stuff that juries is talking

00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:28,830
about in his keynote about how you know

00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:30,509
like how these front-end frameworks are

00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:31,979
kind of happening in stuffs not talked

00:04:30,509 --> 00:04:33,330
about you know creating a drupal theme

00:04:31,979 --> 00:04:35,099
and angular and I I thought it was

00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:36,300
really cool and I still think a lot

00:04:35,099 --> 00:04:37,740
these clients I've frameworks are really

00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:40,199
cool but triple Eight's coming out and

00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:43,080
there's going to be some tools that you

00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:44,729
know we can use in Drupal 8 on the front

00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:46,560
end and I thought it would be good to

00:04:44,729 --> 00:04:48,840
put forward a presentation that talked

00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:52,560
went in a little too a little bit how

00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:54,750
we're doing theming now how you know

00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,870
what how we've done theming in the past

00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:59,580
how we're doing theming now and how in

00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:01,020
the future you know front-end might

00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:04,740
might change a little bit especially

00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:06,449
relating to the release of Drupal 8 the

00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:08,820
last speakers slides were really nice

00:05:06,449 --> 00:05:10,800
mine are kind of figuring me figuring

00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:12,750
out reveal Jas and some code examples

00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:17,070
and stuff so on the front end developer

00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:19,080
another designer but yeah so let me get

00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:20,430
started I guess first how many I don't

00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,599
like putting ourselves into a box but

00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:23,340
how many people here would call

00:05:21,599 --> 00:05:25,440
themselves like a front-end developer

00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:26,820
front end so most people are front-end

00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,409
that's that's good i don't have to

00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:30,470
explain things too much then the last

00:05:28,409 --> 00:05:33,659
one everybody was back end developers so

00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:36,570
SAS templating engines may handlebars

00:05:33,659 --> 00:05:38,110
things people are familiar with or semi

00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:40,300
familiar with so that's that's good

00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:41,800
have some of that in my presentation how

00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:45,100
many people here working like an agency

00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:47,680
say an agency versus internal a lot of

00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:53,230
people so i'll have a lot of in common

00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:54,580
with people this is like a common design

00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:56,710
that you might get i don't know if

00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:58,330
people are doing design different ways a

00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:59,890
lot of times we get a Photoshop file

00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:01,450
something that looks like this really

00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:03,850
common something common that you might

00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:07,390
put in to Drupal you know you have an

00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:12,670
image you have a title i have a link and

00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:14,230
a back-end developer might think okay or

00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:15,520
anybody if you're if you're familiar

00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:17,230
with roopa site building you might think

00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:21,100
this is a perfect case for something

00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:23,950
like views write a list of nodes link

00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:26,920
off to a detail page classic case for

00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:30,400
something like views as your site

00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:31,780
building choice and the quickest way to

00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,130
style something reviews you know say a

00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:34,540
back-end developers in charge of

00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:36,850
configuring some advanced configuration

00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:38,380
for that view and hands it off to you

00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:41,340
being the front-end developer the themer

00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:43,990
or maybe you have to do it yourself and

00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:45,580
you look at the markup and the mark-up

00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:46,630
looks something like this I made it

00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:48,940
small because it really doesn't matter

00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:51,700
what is there just you can't read it and

00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:53,560
it's kind of terrible but somewhere in

00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:56,410
there you're going to find these classes

00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:58,900
that you can grab onto and theme and

00:06:56,410 --> 00:07:02,440
make your make what what that was given

00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:05,770
to you kind of look pretty yeah they're

00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:07,870
in there somewhere I've kind of mocked

00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:11,080
it up a little bit using position

00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:12,700
absolute this is the class you're going

00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,900
to find and I just I don't even know if

00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:15,640
that's the right one I looked at it I

00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:17,830
think so it doesn't really matter but

00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:20,770
basically Drupal classes they give you

00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:22,300
this prefix that you have to that's

00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:24,430
usually the name of the particular site

00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:26,230
building module of choice and then

00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:29,050
followed by some sort of ID that you

00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:31,660
might identify by and that would be the

00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:33,100
container right so views view homepage

00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:35,680
grids say that they wanted to view on

00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:36,730
the homepage and then you might have an

00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,870
item these are the things that are

00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:39,010
important to you you want the item

00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:40,900
because you're going to do some sort of

00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:42,250
grid setup and you want the container to

00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:44,500
do maybe a max way if there's something

00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:45,970
like that so this might be the if

00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:48,910
depending on the views plugin that's

00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:51,540
being used depending on a couple of

00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:53,550
different things this might be the class

00:07:51,540 --> 00:08:01,140
you just attach your group you know your

00:07:53,550 --> 00:08:03,900
grid based styling to yeah so this is I

00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:07,860
guess the code that you might use I mean

00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:09,600
this is a so it's kind of nested yeah

00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:12,120
you might start off by just putting some

00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:15,090
code in two styles scss you might just

00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:17,730
have one file for all of your your your

00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:20,070
different components around the site so

00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:22,410
you know you have a max width and you

00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:25,050
have with 33-percent kind of makes sense

00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:26,970
with what we've shown obviously there's

00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:29,070
going to be a whole other set of slew of

00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:33,419
properties CSS properties that you're

00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:34,890
going to have to attach there but yeah

00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:36,810
you we're not I'm not going to put those

00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:42,810
in for examples sake I'm just this is

00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:45,570
just you know and as an example yeah so

00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:48,690
you you're able to pretty quickly get

00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:51,030
that view up and theme the way the

00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:53,460
design looks just by attaching some some

00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:55,830
styling to some Drupal classes spit out

00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:58,130
by views but then say further down the

00:08:55,830 --> 00:09:00,990
line you have to add other

00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:03,240
implementations of this grid and

00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:04,710
different sections of this site you

00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:07,410
might have one on the homepage that we

00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:09,480
discuss but there also might be another

00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:12,690
instance on a landing page where you

00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:15,300
need to do some promotional items and

00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:17,130
there might be some related content on

00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:18,630
the bottom of a node page like in like

00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:20,670
an article page that shows the links a

00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:23,100
list of articles in the very similar

00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:26,610
fashion in a grid fashion as as a design

00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:28,950
i showed before and the site builders

00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:30,420
and product owner and and client might

00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:32,310
have special requirements so the views

00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:33,870
is fine for the homepage but there's

00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:35,250
going to be all sorts of other site

00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:37,380
though I mean on every Drupal site to me

00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:38,730
it seems like there's people using a

00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:40,230
million different site building tools

00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:41,970
you know just settle on one based on

00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:45,240
what you need based on the content

00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:46,950
editing experience for instance the

00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:50,280
promo might be done in paragraphs that

00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:53,700
way you can give the client or the site

00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:57,450
builder a way to add images and things

00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:59,940
curate content on a per node basis the

00:09:57,450 --> 00:10:02,040
related content might need to use entity

00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:04,020
reference because you might want to have

00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,720
database relationships between the

00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:06,279
articles and all

00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:10,329
articles and show them on the bottom of

00:10:06,279 --> 00:10:12,930
the page and then the promo might need

00:10:10,329 --> 00:10:14,829
to be purple or something anyway the

00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:16,899
specifics around this is not important

00:10:14,829 --> 00:10:19,569
just kind of say that we're using a lot

00:10:16,899 --> 00:10:21,189
of different site building and and there

00:10:19,569 --> 00:10:25,360
might be different sections of the same

00:10:21,189 --> 00:10:26,980
design on other parts of the website so

00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:29,350
using paragraphs just to go through it

00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:31,089
quickly you might have a container pair

00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:33,579
whatever whatever paragraphs gives you

00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:34,899
paragraphs container and a paragraphs

00:10:33,579 --> 00:10:36,430
item and you're going to do a very

00:10:34,899 --> 00:10:39,850
similar thing that you did in the view

00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:41,170
you're going to you're going to you're

00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:43,899
going to you're going to you're going to

00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:45,250
style the view and the very power graphs

00:10:43,899 --> 00:10:47,259
a very similar way to the view obviously

00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:49,709
there's a little bit of variation here

00:10:47,259 --> 00:10:54,370
but the point here I'm trying to make is

00:10:49,709 --> 00:10:56,319
that even though I'm putting these these

00:10:54,370 --> 00:11:00,329
are using very simple properties right

00:10:56,319 --> 00:11:03,100
but and two different implementations of

00:11:00,329 --> 00:11:07,000
of this grid and using different site

00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:08,529
building tools but this CSS even though

00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,829
it's listed together on the same page

00:11:08,529 --> 00:11:13,300
here for demonstrations purpose could

00:11:10,829 --> 00:11:15,939
quite probably be in very different

00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:17,230
parts of your stylesheet I'm not sure

00:11:15,939 --> 00:11:18,870
how you're structuring your your

00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:21,399
partials or how you're structuring your

00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:24,040
CSS your sass or whatever preprocessor

00:11:21,399 --> 00:11:26,139
you're using but oftentimes you don't

00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:27,430
even know you'll style these things

00:11:26,139 --> 00:11:30,040
again depending may be a project manager

00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:31,750
a week later says style this bit you'll

00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,829
go and style it all over even though

00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:35,939
you've already done the styling

00:11:32,829 --> 00:11:38,829
something very similar in the past so

00:11:35,939 --> 00:11:40,420
yeah I mean this stuff might happen

00:11:38,829 --> 00:11:42,220
might be in a lot of different places if

00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:43,480
I can zoom down here yeah and here's

00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:45,370
your entity reference you might have

00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:48,970
another thing this and this happens I've

00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:51,250
looked at some old projects and you know

00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:52,930
we've had this very same thing this is

00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:55,480
what was happening to two years ago

00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:58,120
three years ago and here's an example

00:11:55,480 --> 00:12:00,639
excuse I'm not pointing out that he just

00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:03,790
made the last commit but well for will

00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:05,259
this is just an example of a project

00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:07,569
this is when we but maybe two or three

00:12:05,259 --> 00:12:10,809
years ago when we were putting all the

00:12:07,569 --> 00:12:12,880
styles and the same in the same style

00:12:10,809 --> 00:12:14,860
sheet basically everything in styles des

00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:16,720
CSS because that was the easiest way to

00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:17,860
kind of do it how are you going with

00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,899
this sort of these sort of

00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:21,339
classes in this sort of markup how are

00:12:19,899 --> 00:12:23,620
you going to organize it in any other

00:12:21,339 --> 00:12:24,730
way how are you going to make how are

00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:26,040
you going to make partials what are

00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:28,750
going to make partials based on

00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:30,310
paragraphs or based on views they have

00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:32,200
really have nothing to do with what the

00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:33,970
actual design looks like in the

00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:35,920
different components of the design might

00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:40,029
look like that made the different

00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:41,470
patterns that make up the design this is

00:12:40,029 --> 00:12:44,649
hard to see but it really doesn't matter

00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:46,029
i just noticed this but this is this is

00:12:44,649 --> 00:12:49,060
on another project a couple years later

00:12:46,029 --> 00:12:50,709
where we decided that we wanted because

00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:54,399
the one style sheets very hard to

00:12:50,709 --> 00:12:56,589
maintain so we decided we wanted to you

00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:58,660
know break things up and in a more

00:12:56,589 --> 00:13:00,220
organized way but in my opinion it kind

00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:02,350
of just made things harder can't really

00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:05,079
see this but says node article this is

00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:07,529
the article featured and and in the

00:13:05,079 --> 00:13:10,000
class inside the classes inside of

00:13:07,529 --> 00:13:12,010
bottom lines that the classes inside of

00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,589
the particular partial has not have

00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:17,470
nothing to do with the actual name of

00:13:14,589 --> 00:13:19,329
the partial itself so by looking at the

00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:22,149
partial tells you nothing about what's

00:13:19,329 --> 00:13:28,500
inside of it which to me makes things

00:13:22,149 --> 00:13:31,899
hard to organize so with these problems

00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:33,880
there's more problems to do with drupal

00:13:31,899 --> 00:13:37,810
default Drupal markup but I have to move

00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:39,579
through this so you know the industry as

00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:42,310
a whole front end as a whole I have come

00:13:39,579 --> 00:13:45,510
up with a kind of a better solution and

00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:47,890
there's all solutions but i think the

00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:49,690
settle on a solution last couple years

00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:52,029
it has have been what's called design

00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:54,220
components where you use is very similar

00:13:52,029 --> 00:13:57,910
to Drupal modules if you think where you

00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:59,890
you come up with a name any name for a

00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:02,019
component I'm pretty grid it really

00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:03,970
doesn't matter there are some rules that

00:14:02,019 --> 00:14:05,110
have to do with it but the naming but in

00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:06,970
the end of the day as long as it is a

00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:08,800
unique name that describes a pattern it

00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:10,720
doesn't matter you describe it's kind of

00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:13,779
like a drupal module you know just you

00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:15,100
have a namespace and then you have sub

00:14:13,779 --> 00:14:16,570
components that go along things you're

00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:17,949
grouping things together like in a

00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:19,720
drupal module you might have the name of

00:14:17,949 --> 00:14:22,209
the module in the beginning and then as

00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:23,850
a hook or something and then you might

00:14:22,209 --> 00:14:27,220
have some sub functions or methods

00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:29,800
inside of there so and that's what you

00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:30,880
can follow the same pattern and when you

00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:33,460
create

00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:36,820
what industries call the design design

00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:39,340
components it's important that the

00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:44,140
naming of these components don't relate

00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:45,940
to drupal configuration so you don't

00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:48,700
want anything any naming in your in your

00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:50,530
I mean this is all opinion by the way I

00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:51,880
don't take it anything the harder you

00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:54,150
can come talk to me after but this is

00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:57,970
how I kind of do things the naming of

00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:59,650
your design component or your name space

00:14:57,970 --> 00:15:03,250
to kind of conflict with Drupal and

00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:04,630
confuse you you also probably don't want

00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:06,010
it to have anything to do with the

00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:07,900
actual content because you might have

00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:09,670
different content flowing in and out of

00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:11,290
these design components for example if

00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:13,930
you call this article grid and you

00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:15,790
wanted to have pages or some other

00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:18,010
content type flow through here then that

00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:19,630
could totally cramp your style when it

00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:24,250
comes to you know styling it in the

00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:25,780
future yeah and you know sub you can

00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:28,150
have the item but you all you can have

00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:29,920
some components tiny sub components to

00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:32,530
like maybe the title is slightly

00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:34,780
different than something else so what

00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:37,840
does the CSS for this looks like in my

00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:39,460
opinion a lot cleaner you have some

00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:42,400
namespace classes i'm using the actual

00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:45,880
name of the component itself pretty grid

00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:47,470
just made it up by the way and you're

00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:49,720
actually putting it in it to a partial Q

00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:51,910
so you can see this partial is named the

00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:53,350
same as the class so all of a sudden it

00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:54,610
becomes a lot easier when you're looking

00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:56,020
around your your markup and you're

00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:58,120
looking around your website you see a

00:15:56,020 --> 00:16:00,580
component name pretty grid then you know

00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:02,380
that you can go and find pretty grid in

00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:04,450
a nice partial somewhere and everything

00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:07,570
to do with pretty grid is is isn't

00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:09,340
inside of that partial and you can see

00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:11,080
I'm using the name of the component as a

00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:12,490
container but you can also just as

00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:13,930
easily say you know underscore

00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:15,660
underscore container and these

00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:19,930
underscores and dashes and stuff this is

00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:21,220
using a methodology called bem and i'm

00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:23,290
not going to get into the rules it's a

00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:25,090
little bit complex to understand John

00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:27,700
Albin my coworker has gone in through

00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:29,740
the over the last couple of his sessions

00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:32,050
and gone into kind of the nitty-gritty

00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:34,650
of them and talking about a lot of the

00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:36,970
syntax but I wanted to bring this this

00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:38,290
this kind of methodology up again

00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:40,420
because I think has to do with some more

00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:42,420
stuff I want to get into anyway so

00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:44,940
here's pretty great item you have your

00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:47,160
you're you're with your grid item widths

00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:52,320
and you might you know add a larger font

00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:56,760
size for the title just example but with

00:16:52,320 --> 00:17:00,660
your CSS you really in my opinion you

00:16:56,760 --> 00:17:02,190
really want to have example markup first

00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:05,490
off for two reasons first off

00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:07,829
prototyping I mean in Drupal maybe five

00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:09,179
six years ago when I was seven eight

00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:10,829
years ago when I was first you know

00:17:09,179 --> 00:17:12,540
beginning I didn't even know how to

00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:14,579
write markup Drupal did everything for

00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:16,319
me I've made views and it sped up the

00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:17,910
markup and I was theming I was doing a

00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:19,470
lot of CSS and I was working for

00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:21,419
companies and stuff but I didn't know

00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:24,179
how to create markup I didn't I just

00:17:21,419 --> 00:17:25,980
knew that Drupal spat out did so when

00:17:24,179 --> 00:17:28,110
you're creating the CSS you have to

00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:29,580
actually write the mark-up by hand which

00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:32,340
is good because you have more control

00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:34,200
over it so for prototyping you need to

00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:36,390
write that markup but also for

00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:38,760
documentation I mean this is a simple

00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:40,320
simple component right here but imagine

00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:42,540
if it was more complex and you had grid

00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:45,030
systems in there and you had responsive

00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:46,320
media queries in there it can start to

00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:48,090
get quite complex so you need to

00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:51,000
understand the source order and actually

00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:52,530
what's going on inside of each component

00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,830
especially in a response of age

00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:56,520
especially when you're dealing with the

00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:58,049
accessibility attributes already

00:17:56,520 --> 00:18:02,270
attribute also all sorts of things that

00:17:58,049 --> 00:18:06,299
you need to be able to to have a tab on

00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:07,919
so documentation and for prototyping you

00:18:06,299 --> 00:18:10,140
should have example markup so basically

00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:12,510
in my opinion the way that we do it

00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:14,490
anyway every class that you write in

00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:15,900
Drupal like when you're theming a site

00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:19,350
every class should have markup

00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:21,600
documentation that shows what is

00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:23,580
happening with your CSS so people can

00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:27,570
understand coming in maintenance in the

00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:29,669
future so fuglies this is a concept

00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:33,059
brought up by you know my coworker John

00:18:29,669 --> 00:18:35,549
Albin he's author of the Zen theme with

00:18:33,059 --> 00:18:40,559
drupal's you know I guess largest or

00:18:35,549 --> 00:18:44,730
most used base theme and most downloaded

00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:47,580
and yeah this is how you might apply so

00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:51,320
you apply your these nice design

00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:55,380
component namespace classes to your

00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:55,900
drupal selectors this is his solution

00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:58,150
for that

00:18:55,900 --> 00:19:00,850
and what you do basically any fugly can

00:18:58,150 --> 00:19:02,350
kind of a kind of cool story funny story

00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:04,090
is that i was working on with him on a

00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:05,560
project and he named these things fugly

00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:09,010
selectors we all know what that means i

00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:10,720
guess but he's it was i guess for a kind

00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:12,460
of more high-profile clients so he's

00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:15,040
changed the name to true Tina just rupal

00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:19,420
selectors i like i like the politically

00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:20,890
incorrect name but anyway yeah so what

00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:22,840
you do here is you have your you know

00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:25,090
you're pretty grid your nice namespace

00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:27,640
component based classes and then you

00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:30,100
come in and you extend these classes on

00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:33,610
to drupal selectors or your fugly

00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:37,120
selectors and this lets you manage your

00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:38,830
different instances around the site in a

00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:41,800
good way and it also what it also does

00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:44,110
is allows you to cut these out if you

00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:46,780
ever want to use your design components

00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:51,760
or your if you ever want to use your

00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:54,430
design which is now translated into HTML

00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:56,140
and CSS and it's it's you know you might

00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:58,480
want to use it in a non Drupal setting

00:19:56,140 --> 00:20:00,580
you might want to use it for some some

00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:02,320
splash page or some some promo for

00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:03,790
another brochure sight of something you

00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:05,530
want to use some of those components you

00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:07,390
can just cut out these fugly selectors

00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:09,160
and then you can go and use that and one

00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:11,200
use case you might want to do is going

00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:14,200
from Drupal 7 to Drupal 8 I remember

00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:16,000
going from Drupal 6 to Drupal 7 a lot of

00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:18,880
times what we would have to do is do a

00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,460
full rebrand because our design was so

00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:23,290
embedded into whatever site building

00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:25,570
opinions we had which were the actual

00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:26,830
fugly selectors whatever the site

00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:28,270
building tools we were using at the time

00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:30,490
those are embedded into our design

00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:33,190
because we were attaching our our Styles

00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:37,360
directly to Drupal selectors so this is

00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:39,040
in my opinion a must-have for for you

00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:41,440
know be able to maintain your site and

00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:43,540
be able to redeem your site if or trans

00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:45,790
Trent you know trans transport your site

00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:47,830
in the future or moving to Drupal 8

00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:49,420
anyway I thought I'd put an example I've

00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:50,560
talked about some of the different parts

00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:52,300
but I want to talk a little bit about

00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:54,460
like a full-length show you guys like a

00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:55,930
full example of what like a complete

00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:57,880
component might look like one of these

00:20:55,930 --> 00:21:00,790
partials and this is not just something

00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:02,500
we're using it previousnext this I've

00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:04,840
had a look at some other frameworks and

00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:07,060
Ubuntu is vanilla framework has a very

00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:09,170
similar example where they to this

00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:11,960
particular example where you

00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:15,320
should we put the mark up inside of your

00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:17,600
s CSS file as documentation as some sort

00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:20,240
of to show people okay well this is what

00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:22,280
the CSS is actually doing so you can

00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:24,020
click there and see their example that

00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:27,050
basically you go through and you might

00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:29,720
have some styling of your pretty grid

00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:31,160
and and you might have some fugly

00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:32,630
selectors and you can see that these

00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:34,550
fugly selectors start to get a little

00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:36,680
bit intense you have to start mapping

00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:39,620
them but they're mapped in a pattern oh

00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:43,490
I didn't escape those are supposed to be

00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:49,190
underscore underscore they're mapped in

00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:50,870
a pattern that is is consistent I'm and

00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:52,910
and and it's abstract it your design is

00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:55,040
now extracted from Drupal which is

00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:59,000
really important moving into the moving

00:21:55,040 --> 00:22:02,150
into the future so here's just another

00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:05,270
example of the little component so in my

00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:06,860
opinion no matter how small your CSS no

00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:08,990
matter what the little tweak is it

00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:11,060
should always live in a component and

00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:12,320
it's it's confusing at first when you

00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:14,150
first start getting into this kind of

00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:16,610
idea but it ends up making a lot more

00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:19,040
sense as you as you work with them so

00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:20,630
even something as small as I can read

00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:21,860
more link or something obviously you

00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:26,870
would probably have more properties in

00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:28,730
that just for example purpose yeah so

00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:33,220
that is another example of a component

00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:35,600
and it has a little bit of Marco so

00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:38,720
extending design patterns so when you

00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:40,160
start building your designs like this or

00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:43,160
building your themes like this or

00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:45,470
whatever you're doing you can start

00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:47,090
amassing these components pretty quickly

00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:49,280
start having quite a few of them and

00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:51,920
some of them might be I don't have

00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:54,320
anyone's heard of like pattern lab or

00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:56,330
atomic design you might have smaller

00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:59,330
components that fit into larger

00:22:56,330 --> 00:23:00,950
components and for example here the way

00:22:59,330 --> 00:23:04,430
you kind of do that from the CSS

00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:08,420
perspective is you know you can well

00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:09,830
before I say that these components do

00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:11,830
something really important as well the

00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:16,490
name spacing of them they basically

00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:19,720
break CSS they take the C out of CSF

00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:21,530
they take the cascade out of CSS to wear

00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:22,580
whatever happens

00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:24,890
inside of one of these components

00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:26,240
shouldn't affect what happens within the

00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:28,820
other components now you can write

00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:30,890
things and be totally sure that because

00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:32,720
their names based and we do that all of

00:23:30,890 --> 00:23:36,620
you know in computer programming

00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:39,310
whatever all over the place but yeah

00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:41,390
that's important thing so the Cascade is

00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:45,230
basically broken we don't care about it

00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:48,410
anymore unless you kind of do care about

00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:50,360
it though if you are wanting to use CSS

00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:52,970
from one component in a smaller

00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:56,780
component in a larger component and

00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:59,030
here's a perfect example in our pretty

00:23:56,780 --> 00:24:01,130
grid title remember the little the title

00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:02,570
with me Sven go back real quick the tire

00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:06,170
here it is I guess with the title with a

00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:09,080
little arrow you might want to extend

00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:10,400
that that arrow could be complex you

00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:12,140
might have an SVG you might need to

00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,370
position the SVG over to the right uni

00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:15,350
it might need some padding you might

00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:16,970
need some CSS three properties you might

00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:19,370
need auto prefix or stuff you might need

00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:20,960
some responsive things that happen so

00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:22,670
you might have quite a few properties

00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,080
there I mean you might not want to write

00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:25,730
that over and over and over again so you

00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:27,530
might win the title you might want to

00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:29,630
say well this is pretty similar to read

00:24:27,530 --> 00:24:31,040
more but actually the font size is a

00:24:29,630 --> 00:24:32,660
little bit bigger and then maybe you

00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:34,310
have to move air around or maybe the

00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:37,010
font there's a different font family or

00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:39,500
something like that so this is a way by

00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:41,560
importing this is a kind of a SAS thing

00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:46,520
but other preprocessors have a similar

00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:49,790
sort of setup by importing the the sub

00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:51,800
component in the in the head we're not

00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:54,440
in the head in the top of the page you

00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:56,330
can ensure that that CSS based on I mean

00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:59,240
using compass in this particular

00:24:56,330 --> 00:25:01,850
instance you can ensure that the CSS

00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:04,760
will actually come be read more CSS will

00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:06,650
come before the pretty grid title CSS

00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:08,330
which is actually becomes important that

00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:11,570
in that case the Cascade is important

00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:13,370
and by using dependencies by listing at

00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:15,050
a hierarchy you can start doing some

00:25:13,370 --> 00:25:16,640
pretty cool stuff and reuse code where

00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:17,780
you might not have been able to reuse it

00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:19,250
and when you start doing this you start

00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:20,600
seeing a lot more patterns in your

00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:28,130
design when you actually have the tools

00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:30,140
to to do something like this so this is

00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:33,590
just something we've been doing recently

00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:34,450
and it's so I showed you an example of

00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:37,300
have

00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:40,270
the HTML the HTML documentation inside

00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:42,070
of the actual component itself and

00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:45,580
putting all the different languages in

00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:46,870
the component is I guess you might make

00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:50,050
if the component is complex it might

00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:51,970
make the partial pretty big I guess they

00:25:50,050 --> 00:25:54,040
do that in react components and some

00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:55,480
other components they they they put

00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:57,310
everything into one file but I like the

00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:58,900
idea of splitting out your different

00:25:57,310 --> 00:26:01,840
language dependencies in two different

00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:04,090
files so pretty grid might have some CSS

00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:06,220
that it requires it might have some HTML

00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:07,990
I may also my house in JavaScript that

00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:09,550
does some something fancy maybe equal

00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:11,620
height grids or some fall back or

00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:13,510
something that you need particularly for

00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:15,040
that component I'm not going to get into

00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:16,180
JavaScript dependencies and stuff I

00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:19,510
think there's some other sessions that

00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:22,150
talk a little bit about that but yeah I

00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:23,680
like putting HTML by a long story short

00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:26,590
in a separate file because then you can

00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:28,450
and with your IDE and your if you ever

00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:31,870
want to do anything like linting you can

00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:34,900
use your ID won't bug out freak out it's

00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:36,790
the main reason for me yeah and they do

00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:39,370
this this is not just something I made

00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:41,140
up this is they do this in google

00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:44,740
material design light which is really

00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:47,320
cool framework by google google came out

00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:49,630
with their their material design spec a

00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:50,950
year ago or something and they they were

00:26:49,630 --> 00:26:52,210
true they're hoping to implement it with

00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:54,160
web components but i guess they're a

00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:56,500
little bit too complicated or not ready

00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:58,990
yet with polymer and the like so they've

00:26:56,500 --> 00:27:02,080
come out with well material design light

00:26:58,990 --> 00:27:05,560
is just a vanilla HTML CSS javascript

00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:11,500
implementation of all of their material

00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:13,120
paper design components anyway so yeah

00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:16,660
like i said you might have a lot of

00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:19,390
these components and you have a lot of

00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:21,640
this example markup and you have nowhere

00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:25,150
to prototype and you're creating static

00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:27,040
sites and boilerplate HTML files just to

00:27:25,150 --> 00:27:28,960
see your components because you want to

00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:30,700
create components and so I really you

00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:33,580
need some tooling that's going to allow

00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:36,340
you to take this HTML and actually

00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:38,350
visualize it because just looking at the

00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:39,760
HTML at the top of a file I mean it will

00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:41,260
give you some hint of how it's supposed

00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:43,390
to be used if you're familiar with HTML

00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:46,690
but you really need to see it with the

00:27:43,390 --> 00:27:47,270
CSS actually applied to it in a setting

00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:50,090
that

00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:52,490
is referenceable you know and in like a

00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:57,590
catalogue sort of said I and that is

00:27:52,490 --> 00:27:59,660
where a style guide might come in so a

00:27:57,590 --> 00:28:01,970
style guide when I first heard about

00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:07,190
style guides I think like all I thought

00:28:01,970 --> 00:28:10,100
I thought immediately of the the AP

00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:13,490
style guide like of writing content and

00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:17,750
how to structure content because I've

00:28:13,490 --> 00:28:18,950
done it in college but in MailChimp does

00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:20,690
something similar to where they talk

00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:22,310
about the voice in the tone that they

00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:24,560
might use you know if you ever use

00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:26,150
MailChimp to have the funny little jokes

00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:30,560
all around when you're trying to create

00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:33,140
email campaigns yeah so that's this is

00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:34,400
this is a style guide for for content

00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:36,020
but this is not really what I'm getting

00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:40,460
at when I talk about like a tool that

00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:41,780
can help with our markup what a lot of

00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:43,330
designers sink when you tell them well

00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:46,670
you know we need a style guide we need

00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:49,220
component based design they think Oh

00:28:46,670 --> 00:28:52,280
like element collages or style tiles

00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:54,290
where you have some colors they give you

00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:56,390
like a Photoshop file with a couple of

00:28:54,290 --> 00:28:58,760
colors in it and in some typography and

00:28:56,390 --> 00:29:00,850
Psyche here's your style guide well it's

00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:05,450
a little bit more than that as well and

00:29:00,850 --> 00:29:07,400
going back to material design light they

00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:09,170
actually have a good component library

00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:11,630
and I think that's more the word we're

00:29:09,170 --> 00:29:13,850
looking for a component design a

00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:15,830
component library and I guess I call

00:29:13,850 --> 00:29:17,690
this a static component library because

00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:22,490
all their components are just HTML CSS

00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:24,620
and JavaScript and this is really cool

00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:26,150
you can actually click on you know these

00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:27,650
I can't do it in here obviously but you

00:29:26,150 --> 00:29:29,570
can click and do chrome inspector and

00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:31,130
actually see how these things are made

00:29:29,570 --> 00:29:33,970
and you can actually open them up in

00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:36,620
code pen I like the style guide a lot

00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:38,480
yeah and you can see the mark up here as

00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:41,380
well which is really important and as a

00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:44,720
catalog of all the different components

00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:46,910
so the tool that I'm talking about is

00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:50,270
more of a style guide generator and

00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:53,180
that's what we use we use what's called

00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:58,610
a style guide generator and we use a

00:29:53,180 --> 00:30:01,010
product a project called KSS note KSS

00:29:58,610 --> 00:30:02,690
stands for Niall style sheet

00:30:01,010 --> 00:30:04,460
something that some guy made probably a

00:30:02,690 --> 00:30:06,920
couple years ago he made it in Ruby and

00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:09,560
github use now style sheets the ruby

00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:16,790
version for their style guide component

00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:18,590
library yeah so why do we use KSS node

00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:20,240
instead of cases Ruby well front-end

00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:24,380
developers tend to know more JavaScript

00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:25,460
than they know Ruby and so it's easy if

00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:28,250
something goes wrong in the style guide

00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:31,340
you can make commit the other reason I

00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:35,690
guess we use KSS node at previousnext is

00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:37,400
because John Albin who's my coworker

00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:39,140
he's the maintainer is only the

00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:41,030
maintainer of Zen he's a maintainer of

00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:42,760
chaos this node another reason that

00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:45,470
people in Drupal might want to consider

00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:48,440
KSS note is that now in the latest alpha

00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:51,830
version of Zen a cassis node is included

00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:53,720
by default and all of the components CSS

00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:56,720
components inside of Zen start kit is

00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:57,980
you know basically built around the KSS

00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:02,900
node style guide because John's

00:30:57,980 --> 00:31:05,120
maintainers in and of cases node now

00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:07,340
just a note with KSS node kiss and this

00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:10,610
is a pretty big when people are coming

00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:14,090
and learning it it's the cases node does

00:31:10,610 --> 00:31:17,120
not care about CSS or JavaScript it only

00:31:14,090 --> 00:31:20,180
cares about Marco so it parses your CSS

00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:21,950
files and looks for markup basically and

00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:24,700
a feature of cases is that you can

00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:26,900
specify that we've added recently I

00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:27,920
mention in the past and before in the

00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:29,960
previous slide is that you can add a

00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:33,140
separate markup file and cast this node

00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:35,510
will know about it cases node is just an

00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:37,160
NPM package you download it and you can

00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:42,140
use it in the command line and feed it a

00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:46,010
few arguments yeah so we need a way to

00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:48,290
get all of the CSA all of the HTML out

00:31:46,010 --> 00:31:49,970
of all of our components and all of the

00:31:48,290 --> 00:31:52,430
CSS out of our components all the

00:31:49,970 --> 00:31:54,650
JavaScript out of our components and get

00:31:52,430 --> 00:31:58,310
it into our style guide or K assist own

00:31:54,650 --> 00:32:01,310
style guide and our Drupal site and the

00:31:58,310 --> 00:32:08,990
way we do that is with some tool length

00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:12,140
so we use gulp to basically on to watch

00:32:08,990 --> 00:32:12,800
our saves basically and cassis node will

00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:15,890
parse out

00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:17,870
HTML from each one of our components and

00:32:15,890 --> 00:32:21,170
we allows us to follow this component

00:32:17,870 --> 00:32:24,910
based workflow and parse it into you

00:32:21,170 --> 00:32:28,250
know these performance one HTTP requests

00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:29,990
CSS file javascript file and HTML phone

00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:32,660
okay asus know is just a blue just cares

00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:34,730
about HTML we have other sessions that

00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:36,080
might talk about the CSS I guess talked

00:32:34,730 --> 00:32:37,340
a little bit with the imports and stuff

00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:42,530
but then JavaScript something else

00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:46,430
altogether this component based this

00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:48,110
component based methodologies is going

00:32:46,430 --> 00:32:50,120
to be pretty prevalent when web

00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:54,140
components come out or when they're

00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:55,880
supported in in most browsers and yeah

00:32:54,140 --> 00:33:00,070
it's important that we start looking at

00:32:55,880 --> 00:33:00,070
building building front end in this way

00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:09,350
so this is what it looks like after you

00:33:06,410 --> 00:33:11,990
after your HTML and your CSS has been

00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:14,750
parsed your CSS has been parched of all

00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:18,710
the markup documentation KSS know will

00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:20,660
give you a catalog for you your

00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:22,370
particular component and look it's just

00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:24,410
a very small component here it's not

00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:26,990
nothing big and it's not very pretty it

00:33:24,410 --> 00:33:30,880
doesn't look like the material design

00:33:26,990 --> 00:33:34,690
light style guide but it serves a

00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:38,570
portent purpose because now we can take

00:33:34,690 --> 00:33:40,490
we can take a URL a reference to this

00:33:38,570 --> 00:33:42,140
particular component and we can send it

00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:45,500
around the company or send it around our

00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:47,930
client or our development team and we

00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:50,870
can iterate on this particular component

00:33:47,930 --> 00:33:53,660
and talk about it and reuse it and maybe

00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:56,180
even do testing on it maybe we can do

00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:57,680
some sort of screenshot your Wraith

00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:58,550
testing or something I mean that's a

00:33:57,680 --> 00:34:01,910
little bit too much for this

00:33:58,550 --> 00:34:04,550
presentation but it's having a URL for

00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:06,650
something is is really important and

00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:08,540
your markups there as well you can

00:34:06,650 --> 00:34:09,710
actually see the mark-up that's used

00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:11,179
obviously you can look at it in chrome

00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:12,440
inspector but it's nice being able to

00:34:11,179 --> 00:34:15,290
look at it right next to the actual

00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:16,850
component and you can find all of your

00:34:15,290 --> 00:34:20,120
components pretty easily and this is a

00:34:16,850 --> 00:34:22,700
huge benefit when you're developing so

00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:24,350
it's a really important and in my

00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:25,369
opinion for larger sites that like a

00:34:24,350 --> 00:34:27,169
must have

00:34:25,369 --> 00:34:28,460
workflow whether you're using que Estes

00:34:27,169 --> 00:34:36,710
know there's all sorts of other style

00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:40,549
guides out there now yeah so a little

00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:42,169
bit more about a design component but

00:34:40,549 --> 00:34:44,720
then kisses know has some some

00:34:42,169 --> 00:34:48,440
interesting things in it as well first

00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:52,190
off its I mean we have a CSS file and

00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:55,129
our normal static are static HTML CSS

00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:57,319
JavaScript components but que haces know

00:34:55,129 --> 00:34:59,509
doesn't necessarily need to use HTML @

00:34:57,319 --> 00:35:01,849
can use HTML but it can also use the

00:34:59,509 --> 00:35:04,400
templating language of your choice like

00:35:01,849 --> 00:35:06,769
a template file and using a template

00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:08,690
file means that you can have variables

00:35:06,769 --> 00:35:10,700
just like you know think of any of our

00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:11,630
Drupal templates or if anyone's played

00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:12,980
everyone said they're front-end

00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:14,869
developers played with you know

00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:16,759
templating engines or anything you can

00:35:14,869 --> 00:35:19,480
actually in our components we can have

00:35:16,759 --> 00:35:21,589
data that moves in and out of our

00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:24,230
components which is really important if

00:35:21,589 --> 00:35:25,640
you want to start having using your

00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:27,980
components in different places you need

00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:29,630
the titles to save different things you

00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:31,039
need to have different contexts you

00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:32,299
might need to be different colors you

00:35:31,039 --> 00:35:34,759
might need to feed it different classes

00:35:32,299 --> 00:35:37,339
you need to have variation in the heap

00:35:34,759 --> 00:35:40,460
of Mark you know in the component that

00:35:37,339 --> 00:35:44,779
you're trying to edit and it also lets

00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:47,420
you so KSS also lets you specify a JSON

00:35:44,779 --> 00:35:49,309
file which has some some default data

00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:51,019
basically placeholder data for that

00:35:49,309 --> 00:35:52,400
component because obviously in the style

00:35:51,019 --> 00:35:54,259
guide it's not something that's dynamic

00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:57,410
you just want to have something there

00:35:54,259 --> 00:35:58,519
that you can you know just see and when

00:35:57,410 --> 00:36:00,079
it gets generated so I'll show you

00:35:58,519 --> 00:36:01,999
example some of this might have been

00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:03,619
confusing waiting for the video have a

00:36:01,999 --> 00:36:08,960
little little video which I made on the

00:36:03,619 --> 00:36:14,420
plane let's see if this works one second

00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:17,410
here can do this ooh okay huh okay I

00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:17,410
have to do it over here when say

00:36:22,569 --> 00:36:26,179
so this is just an example just so you

00:36:24,949 --> 00:36:28,369
can get an idea of how this might work

00:36:26,179 --> 00:36:30,890
you know you have your your your

00:36:28,369 --> 00:36:32,929
component maybe you read more component

00:36:30,890 --> 00:36:37,150
that's what this one is and it has um

00:36:32,929 --> 00:36:40,669
you know little specks of data in it and

00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:43,069
in a JSON file in the same component

00:36:40,669 --> 00:36:45,019
you're going to have a you know if

00:36:43,069 --> 00:36:51,319
you're just going to specify in JSON the

00:36:45,019 --> 00:36:53,119
URL and the title and then you can do

00:36:51,319 --> 00:36:54,109
gulp watch it will compile the style

00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:56,179
guide you can start to see how the

00:36:54,109 --> 00:36:57,409
tooling comes into effect here and if

00:36:56,179 --> 00:36:59,689
anyone has any questions about the

00:36:57,409 --> 00:37:02,179
logistics of that I can walk you through

00:36:59,689 --> 00:37:03,439
how that works and then obviously you

00:37:02,179 --> 00:37:05,479
can come down and you can see your

00:37:03,439 --> 00:37:07,189
component in the style guide here it is

00:37:05,479 --> 00:37:09,079
and then you can see where the data the

00:37:07,189 --> 00:37:11,539
placeholder data has been shown in the

00:37:09,079 --> 00:37:13,099
style guide and this is becomes really

00:37:11,539 --> 00:37:16,130
useful it might look you know a little

00:37:13,099 --> 00:37:21,709
bit hodgepodge here but it's very useful

00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:25,699
to be able to do this and I'll show you

00:37:21,709 --> 00:37:30,140
why because like the CSS be able to

00:37:25,699 --> 00:37:32,390
reuse components from one CSS file or

00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:34,549
one partial and reuse it into another

00:37:32,390 --> 00:37:37,909
and be able to import a whole list of

00:37:34,549 --> 00:37:40,369
properties into maybe a sub part of your

00:37:37,909 --> 00:37:42,169
component you can also do with CSS you

00:37:40,369 --> 00:37:44,029
can also do something like that with

00:37:42,169 --> 00:37:45,499
with markup and that's what that's what

00:37:44,029 --> 00:37:48,499
these template engine czar all about is

00:37:45,499 --> 00:37:51,049
taking pieces of markup and being able

00:37:48,499 --> 00:37:53,449
to mix and match and reuse them and

00:37:51,049 --> 00:37:55,759
place them within other pieces of markup

00:37:53,449 --> 00:38:01,489
and with that you can start to big build

00:37:55,759 --> 00:38:03,769
bigger and bigger components and this is

00:38:01,489 --> 00:38:07,249
this is pattern lab this is the vid this

00:38:03,769 --> 00:38:08,799
is their idea of a page or just do you

00:38:07,249 --> 00:38:11,509
have all these components that are

00:38:08,799 --> 00:38:14,239
compiled together not compile but you

00:38:11,509 --> 00:38:15,289
know included it's just including a

00:38:14,239 --> 00:38:17,630
bunch of different components on the

00:38:15,289 --> 00:38:18,589
page and those components have micro

00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:20,689
components I guess they call them

00:38:18,589 --> 00:38:21,979
molecules and atoms etc and you can do a

00:38:20,689 --> 00:38:23,900
similar sort of thing with case this

00:38:21,979 --> 00:38:27,679
node or whatever templating language

00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:31,039
you're using now a question is like how

00:38:27,679 --> 00:38:31,940
do you get some of this markup that in

00:38:31,039 --> 00:38:35,000
these classes

00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:38,210
is into drupal like how so we've created

00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:41,540
these nice these nice CSS

00:38:38,210 --> 00:38:43,250
component-based selectors and we have

00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:44,900
mark up to that goes along with that and

00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:46,370
we need to either get the classes in the

00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:47,810
drupal you need to get the markup into

00:38:46,370 --> 00:38:50,800
drupal let's talk a little bit about

00:38:47,810 --> 00:38:53,150
these fugly selectors so I have a little

00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:56,900
fragmented slide thing that I made here

00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:59,030
on the left on the left on the left you

00:38:56,900 --> 00:39:00,740
have like the pretty great cart partial

00:38:59,030 --> 00:39:02,720
that we talked about before and inside

00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:04,850
of it you have some extended fuglies on

00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:06,530
the right you have your views view grid

00:39:04,850 --> 00:39:08,360
or whatever your views template file is

00:39:06,530 --> 00:39:10,280
or you view implementation that has

00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:12,560
Drupal markup in it now the problem of

00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:14,720
fugly selectors is that if you get rid

00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:16,550
of that that Drupal implementation you

00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:18,170
then need to go into your partial and

00:39:16,550 --> 00:39:19,700
you need to fish out all of your fugly

00:39:18,170 --> 00:39:20,600
selectors if you want to maintain your

00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:22,160
code you could just leave it there

00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:25,640
nobody would know the wiser probably i

00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:27,710
don't know but um you need to you have

00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:29,900
to go and fish through your components

00:39:27,710 --> 00:39:31,820
and pull out the fugly selectors if you

00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:33,500
actually use the mark up though in your

00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:35,120
template file you don't have that

00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:37,760
problem because you're able to get rid

00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:39,440
of your your your template file which

00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:41,420
has the nice mark up in it and you don't

00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:43,250
need to worry about maintaining the

00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:44,930
component because a component doesn't

00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:47,180
have the design component doesn't have

00:39:44,930 --> 00:39:50,060
any Drupal isms in it it's just fresh

00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:52,820
and and it's by itself and is extracted

00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:55,460
so in my opinion using classes is a

00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:58,070
preferable solution but we all know

00:39:55,460 --> 00:40:00,950
drupal getting classes in Drupal is not

00:39:58,070 --> 00:40:02,810
easy you have these theming functions

00:40:00,950 --> 00:40:06,020
which go on forever luckily they're gone

00:40:02,810 --> 00:40:08,090
in Drupal 8 don't if you have to use one

00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:09,590
of these just use a fugly because you

00:40:08,090 --> 00:40:12,290
don't want have to maintain all that PHP

00:40:09,590 --> 00:40:14,210
code forked PHP code then you have

00:40:12,290 --> 00:40:16,490
markup UI and I can go on a little long

00:40:14,210 --> 00:40:18,740
time about you know getting using panels

00:40:16,490 --> 00:40:20,450
and I know three said we need to make it

00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:23,030
easier for people to you know point and

00:40:20,450 --> 00:40:25,250
click but maybe five years ago when you

00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:28,100
can add a few bootstrap classes and you

00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:30,130
can kind of make a desktop style site

00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:33,230
with a few classes but in my opinion

00:40:30,130 --> 00:40:35,030
having to you know when you have more

00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:36,410
complex components that have responsive

00:40:35,030 --> 00:40:37,880
properties you have to do performance

00:40:36,410 --> 00:40:39,560
you have to test them have to do a lot

00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:41,510
of things getting all of those classes

00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:44,030
and all of that markup in the Drupal

00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:44,300
using display sweet extra or you know

00:40:44,030 --> 00:40:46,700
you

00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:48,290
in panels classes is quite difficult now

00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:50,690
I worked on development team where it

00:40:48,290 --> 00:40:52,190
was great we because we had the style

00:40:50,690 --> 00:40:53,540
guide we had all the classes listed the

00:40:52,190 --> 00:40:55,670
devs were able to go into the style

00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:57,320
guide rip all the classes out and get

00:40:55,670 --> 00:40:59,060
him into Drupal which is great I mean it

00:40:57,320 --> 00:41:00,440
really sped up development but the

00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:02,240
problem is maintenance because on that

00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:04,100
side currently if somebody needs to go

00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:05,210
in and not to say that you shouldn't

00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:06,800
follow that method because it's way

00:41:05,210 --> 00:41:08,840
better than using the Drupal selectors

00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:10,940
if somebody needs to go in and change

00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:12,200
anything they do a command F for that

00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:13,700
particular class because you have them

00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:15,440
the panels are all full of markup and

00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:16,940
you find see tools you know

00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:18,200
configuration because all of you that's

00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:20,590
where all the classes are stored and see

00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:22,820
tools exports so it's a little bit

00:41:20,590 --> 00:41:24,110
difficult and it's just very verbose

00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:25,700
filling these things out over and over

00:41:24,110 --> 00:41:28,520
again I don't have a solution for that

00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:30,080
i'm just complaining a little bit you

00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:32,120
know layout UI is a similar sort of

00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:35,000
thing it seems to me whenever you drag a

00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:36,920
pain into you know the panel's admin

00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:39,260
interface you have to restyle it again

00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:40,790
it doesn't just adding a class or

00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:42,590
something it's nothing you still need to

00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:44,120
get the femur to iterate over it again

00:41:42,590 --> 00:41:48,740
and maybe if you create it in a really

00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:52,280
good in a perfect way it works um I'm

00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:56,210
running out of time here but yeah so the

00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:58,040
akshay i think i'm doing alright so

00:41:56,210 --> 00:42:01,130
benefits of drupal templates and just

00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:02,900
rehash some of this again preserve the

00:42:01,130 --> 00:42:04,910
components or sort of if you're actually

00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:07,340
using drupal templates versus you know

00:42:04,910 --> 00:42:09,350
fuglies or just attaching your classes

00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:11,870
directly your styles directly drupal

00:42:09,350 --> 00:42:14,180
classes you're able to see the mark-up

00:42:11,870 --> 00:42:17,090
and you know preserve that component

00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:18,650
source sorry markup source order not

00:42:17,090 --> 00:42:20,360
component source or markup source order

00:42:18,650 --> 00:42:21,830
that's so important there's no

00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:23,720
configuration management so you're not

00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:27,110
having to if you're using template files

00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:28,760
you're not having to actually go to

00:42:27,110 --> 00:42:29,990
features and refresh that configuration

00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:32,600
because it's just stored and get the

00:42:29,990 --> 00:42:36,230
configuration where the HTML is stored

00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:37,940
in in version control and then yeah you

00:42:36,230 --> 00:42:40,670
can search in the IDE I find a lot

00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:42,920
easier to search things in the ID so

00:42:40,670 --> 00:42:44,570
disadvantage managing template files and

00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:46,610
Drupal is hard like the naming

00:42:44,570 --> 00:42:49,030
convention the naming conventions around

00:42:46,610 --> 00:42:51,920
Drupal templates like no dash dash

00:42:49,030 --> 00:42:55,070
article dash dash my special suggestion

00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:57,020
in template dot PHP is not easy to deal

00:42:55,070 --> 00:42:57,950
with and and people come up with all

00:42:57,020 --> 00:43:00,619
sorts of

00:42:57,950 --> 00:43:02,359
d ideas and how to manage that it can be

00:43:00,619 --> 00:43:05,900
difficult sometimes I'm not a month to

00:43:02,359 --> 00:43:06,950
denying that Duke duplicate templates so

00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:08,210
I want to talk a little bit about this

00:43:06,950 --> 00:43:09,650
this is a problem that bugs me in

00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:13,730
particular it's probably more of a pet

00:43:09,650 --> 00:43:16,250
hate then then I know a worldwide Drupal

00:43:13,730 --> 00:43:20,359
problem but duplicate templates so

00:43:16,250 --> 00:43:22,250
because we have the standard and I

00:43:20,359 --> 00:43:25,010
previousnext that whenever you write CSS

00:43:22,250 --> 00:43:28,550
ready rewrite a component you have to

00:43:25,010 --> 00:43:31,790
have example markup inside of that you

00:43:28,550 --> 00:43:34,550
have to evidence your your CSS with a

00:43:31,790 --> 00:43:36,650
working example HTML example we're

00:43:34,550 --> 00:43:39,020
writing markup no matter what we have to

00:43:36,650 --> 00:43:40,730
write markup because it's part of the

00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:42,980
development process because we're

00:43:40,730 --> 00:43:44,990
writing markup we're also writing markup

00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:46,970
twice or were copy pasting markup so

00:43:44,990 --> 00:43:49,310
what we end up doing because chaos says

00:43:46,970 --> 00:43:52,339
note is written in handlebars and Drupal

00:43:49,310 --> 00:43:57,530
is written in PHP the only thing that's

00:43:52,339 --> 00:43:59,510
different here is the the variables so

00:43:57,530 --> 00:44:02,480
once PHP template ones like little

00:43:59,510 --> 00:44:04,430
brackets it's we should be able to

00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:06,050
somehow reuse and duplicate especially

00:44:04,430 --> 00:44:07,670
when you have a more complex component

00:44:06,050 --> 00:44:09,640
that has a lot more HTML inside it but

00:44:07,670 --> 00:44:13,220
this is just a simple example but

00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:15,740
remember we had views we had paragraphs

00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:17,510
and we had entity reference imagine

00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:19,099
taking that that example on the right

00:44:17,510 --> 00:44:20,569
and having a copy paste it and each one

00:44:19,099 --> 00:44:22,130
of those template files you start to

00:44:20,569 --> 00:44:26,599
find yourself duplicating templates a

00:44:22,130 --> 00:44:28,430
fair bit there so what if Drupal could

00:44:26,599 --> 00:44:30,920
actually use style guide templates so

00:44:28,430 --> 00:44:33,170
what if the templates in Drupal could

00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:34,369
actually leverage what we have in the

00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:35,720
style guide because the style guys

00:44:34,369 --> 00:44:38,720
become such an important part of our

00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:39,950
development process you would have

00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:42,380
Drupal would have to be able to use

00:44:39,950 --> 00:44:44,780
handlebars that's not happening it's the

00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:45,950
Drupal 7 and you know it's not that's

00:44:44,780 --> 00:44:48,920
not going to happen I'm not right now

00:44:45,950 --> 00:44:51,109
I'm not dealing with that KSS know it

00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:52,940
could use PHP template but then you need

00:44:51,109 --> 00:44:55,060
a javascript implementation of PHP

00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:57,560
template that's not going to work

00:44:55,060 --> 00:44:58,760
luckily the Drupal 8 it's got twig and

00:44:57,560 --> 00:45:01,579
that's where things start to get

00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:04,369
interesting because twig is written and

00:45:01,579 --> 00:45:06,290
twig is written in PHP so Drupal could

00:45:04,369 --> 00:45:07,970
potentially use it but as a sin taxes

00:45:06,290 --> 00:45:09,640
more familiar to him or similar to

00:45:07,970 --> 00:45:11,420
handle bars it uses the same brackets

00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:13,369
but that's

00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:15,200
that's not really going to going to help

00:45:13,369 --> 00:45:16,700
us I need your blade twig is in twigs

00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:18,920
awesome for other reasons like it's more

00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:22,609
secure you know we're not writing sequel

00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:24,290
queries in our template files but um you

00:45:22,609 --> 00:45:27,260
know just because it's similar does not

00:45:24,290 --> 00:45:29,180
mean it's it's handlebars you still and

00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:31,250
that's where it gets interesting again

00:45:29,180 --> 00:45:33,430
because there's something called to AJ s

00:45:31,250 --> 00:45:40,700
twig j s is a JavaScript implementation

00:45:33,430 --> 00:45:42,230
of twig and which means that node or KSS

00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:44,089
node which is written node node as a

00:45:42,230 --> 00:45:48,049
service side implementation JavaScript

00:45:44,089 --> 00:45:49,579
can leverage to ajs and use it and its

00:45:48,049 --> 00:45:52,010
template so instead of using handlebars

00:45:49,579 --> 00:45:53,869
KSS is currently written you know has a

00:45:52,010 --> 00:45:56,690
generator that uses handlebars it could

00:45:53,869 --> 00:45:58,130
potentially use twig and Drupal's

00:45:56,690 --> 00:46:05,690
already using Twitter oopah late is

00:45:58,130 --> 00:46:08,839
already using twig yeah so I wrote a

00:46:05,690 --> 00:46:11,839
pull request to John and you know John

00:46:08,839 --> 00:46:14,319
Albin's KSS node and it's passing now it

00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:16,940
looks like it's wasn't passing then but

00:46:14,319 --> 00:46:18,920
yeah I've basically wrote a generator

00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:22,040
that lets what you lets us use twig

00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:23,480
inside of KSS node which is which is

00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:25,760
interesting because now you're using the

00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:27,500
same templates as Drupal might use which

00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:29,690
you know gets it gets you closer to

00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:31,910
making your style guide look like what

00:46:29,690 --> 00:46:34,970
is is going to be in triple eight in

00:46:31,910 --> 00:46:36,920
core um I have to write some tests and

00:46:34,970 --> 00:46:38,150
stuff that's always the hard part when I

00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:41,299
have to learn JavaScript a lot better

00:46:38,150 --> 00:46:43,369
than I already know it but yeah that's

00:46:41,299 --> 00:46:44,569
I'm trying to get that in and I'm sure

00:46:43,369 --> 00:46:46,790
when Drupal eights release there's going

00:46:44,569 --> 00:46:49,970
to be a lot more momentum around getting

00:46:46,790 --> 00:46:51,920
something like that released so let's

00:46:49,970 --> 00:46:54,770
talk a little bit about twig some of the

00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:56,750
syntax for twig well I'm particularly

00:46:54,770 --> 00:46:58,369
interested in it are the includes and in

00:46:56,750 --> 00:46:59,809
handlebars the includes I should an

00:46:58,369 --> 00:47:01,730
example before the includes look

00:46:59,809 --> 00:47:03,200
something like this where you have this

00:47:01,730 --> 00:47:05,630
little arrow and it just kind of

00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:07,790
includes things for you and twig the

00:47:05,630 --> 00:47:11,000
I've spaced it out weird but just so it

00:47:07,790 --> 00:47:12,530
can be using the example yeah you can

00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:15,170
just include in a very similar fashion

00:47:12,530 --> 00:47:16,460
and then you can start you know includes

00:47:15,170 --> 00:47:18,380
the first step into building these

00:47:16,460 --> 00:47:20,270
larger components and we can do this in

00:47:18,380 --> 00:47:22,250
Drupal 8 core this is not necessarily a

00:47:20,270 --> 00:47:23,690
style a bad thing so we can start mixing

00:47:22,250 --> 00:47:25,210
and matching our components hopefully

00:47:23,690 --> 00:47:28,390
whether you're using a style guide

00:47:25,210 --> 00:47:31,600
development or not extending is another

00:47:28,390 --> 00:47:33,220
interesting concept to where you can

00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:35,380
have this markup and this is actually

00:47:33,220 --> 00:47:38,140
extending is used in core as well I

00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:41,050
think in the classy theme or somebody

00:47:38,140 --> 00:47:43,960
will tell me after the after the session

00:47:41,050 --> 00:47:48,460
but it basically allows you to add

00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:50,860
markup to particular templates and yeah

00:47:48,460 --> 00:47:52,690
so you can have you know here's block

00:47:50,860 --> 00:47:55,300
dot HTML twig which is in Drupal core

00:47:52,690 --> 00:47:57,190
and this this potential child template

00:47:55,300 --> 00:47:58,960
is extending it and then just adding a

00:47:57,190 --> 00:48:01,240
little bit of extra markup around the

00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:03,250
content to make it you know maybe make

00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:09,010
it match our design or are what we need

00:48:03,250 --> 00:48:11,560
a little bit better so reusing KSS node

00:48:09,010 --> 00:48:13,300
a Drupal template so you might want what

00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:14,710
you could potentially do and I've had a

00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:17,760
play with this and it's looking pretty

00:48:14,710 --> 00:48:20,530
good but it's not a hundred percent is

00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:22,380
you might want to take something that is

00:48:20,530 --> 00:48:25,150
inside of your Drupal template and

00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:28,540
inside of your style guide sorry and

00:48:25,150 --> 00:48:30,730
that's written in twig and extend it

00:48:28,540 --> 00:48:34,200
inside of a Drupal template and this

00:48:30,730 --> 00:48:36,610
would let you avoid having to have

00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:38,560
having to write you know having that

00:48:36,610 --> 00:48:40,360
duplicate markup in all these different

00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:42,580
template files if you can just extend

00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:44,290
what's already in your style guide and

00:48:42,580 --> 00:48:46,120
then potentially if you change something

00:48:44,290 --> 00:48:47,590
in your style guide it's also going to

00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:49,480
be changed all throughout your Drupal

00:48:47,590 --> 00:48:51,400
site which some people might see as

00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:52,660
scary because who knows what's changing

00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:54,100
but we shouldn't as developers we

00:48:52,660 --> 00:48:55,930
shouldn't think that that's scary if

00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:57,610
you're you should have to be able to

00:48:55,930 --> 00:48:59,350
test for things like that and hopefully

00:48:57,610 --> 00:49:00,790
you know that sort of stuff of all these

00:48:59,350 --> 00:49:02,320
are just some ideas at the end of the

00:49:00,790 --> 00:49:04,570
presentation that i'm throwing out there

00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:07,750
i just want to show you one quick thing

00:49:04,570 --> 00:49:10,240
that you know you might want to do here

00:49:07,750 --> 00:49:15,220
is one more video about reusing

00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:16,540
templates so this is an example i put

00:49:15,220 --> 00:49:17,800
together you know I've played with this

00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:20,410
is always the fun part of these

00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:24,850
presentations and this is the KSS style

00:49:20,410 --> 00:49:29,110
guide and this is a title of the grid

00:49:24,850 --> 00:49:31,630
item that we had seen before and this is

00:49:29,110 --> 00:49:34,120
a Drupal site so this is Drupal 8 site a

00:49:31,630 --> 00:49:36,070
Drupal 8 site that I spun up and it's

00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:37,570
using that same template so I got him

00:49:36,070 --> 00:49:38,190
using the same temple and I was able to

00:49:37,570 --> 00:49:40,410
extend the

00:49:38,190 --> 00:49:43,110
let in here into the into the Drupal 8

00:49:40,410 --> 00:49:46,770
side so it is using the same template

00:49:43,110 --> 00:49:49,730
here to do that now to kind of prove

00:49:46,770 --> 00:49:53,190
that I guess I'm going to put a inline

00:49:49,730 --> 00:49:55,140
SVG into my template which is being used

00:49:53,190 --> 00:49:58,860
by both the style guide and Drupal 8 and

00:49:55,140 --> 00:50:01,440
I'm going to compile my my my template

00:49:58,860 --> 00:50:04,290
or I guess you know generate those that

00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:07,170
static HTML style guide and now you can

00:50:04,290 --> 00:50:09,240
see that obviously that in line SVG is

00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:11,280
there but because Drupal is also using

00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:13,380
that template and it's a guy I've twig

00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:15,330
twig debug mode turned on obviously so

00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:16,860
it's not catching the twig file so any

00:50:15,330 --> 00:50:19,500
changes that make it automatic could be

00:50:16,860 --> 00:50:23,550
seen I mean I go to my drupal site and I

00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:25,530
refresh then obviously the inline SVG is

00:50:23,550 --> 00:50:27,360
there so there's an example of and you

00:50:25,530 --> 00:50:30,720
can imagine having the views homepage

00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:32,670
the promo promo landing page and then

00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:33,930
the entity reference and having all

00:50:32,670 --> 00:50:36,270
those template files just being

00:50:33,930 --> 00:50:37,770
automatically updated and there's no

00:50:36,270 --> 00:50:39,300
mistakes then everything got made if

00:50:37,770 --> 00:50:41,600
it's using that component and extending

00:50:39,300 --> 00:50:44,820
it it got made but one interesting thing

00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:46,800
that can also happen and this is our

00:50:44,820 --> 00:50:49,830
style guide by the way is because we're

00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:52,230
using twig KS templates can not only be

00:50:49,830 --> 00:50:54,600
led like twitch it you know twig works

00:50:52,230 --> 00:50:57,000
in twitch ass works and chaos as node on

00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:59,490
the server side because it's in it's a

00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:01,290
note but obviously JavaScript works in

00:50:59,490 --> 00:51:04,740
the browser as well so there's no reason

00:51:01,290 --> 00:51:07,050
why front end like like the browser

00:51:04,740 --> 00:51:12,000
can't leverage these templates as well

00:51:07,050 --> 00:51:15,030
so what you can do is write a little bit

00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:16,980
of JavaScript that maybe lives in its

00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:19,200
namespace nice with your component lives

00:51:16,980 --> 00:51:21,780
with your component and without even

00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:23,370
having to do anything in Drupal or

00:51:21,780 --> 00:51:26,280
anything just write some JavaScript and

00:51:23,370 --> 00:51:29,990
that that include to ajs in the you know

00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:32,520
in your in your in your browser and then

00:51:29,990 --> 00:51:34,980
yeah and then you're just able to kind

00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:38,100
of pull in you leverage a temp it feed

00:51:34,980 --> 00:51:41,580
data through it may be using that graph

00:51:38,100 --> 00:51:42,930
ql that juries is talking about and yeah

00:51:41,580 --> 00:51:44,820
leverage the same templates on your

00:51:42,930 --> 00:51:47,730
style guide and on your drupal in the

00:51:44,820 --> 00:51:48,810
browser and yeah this is i'm not going

00:51:47,730 --> 00:51:50,530
to get into the javascript it's

00:51:48,810 --> 00:51:53,290
relatively simple

00:51:50,530 --> 00:51:55,030
and yeah and then your drupal site

00:51:53,290 --> 00:51:58,030
remember we just did that in our HTML

00:51:55,030 --> 00:52:00,010
and our sorry our style guide but it

00:51:58,030 --> 00:52:02,230
should theoretically that same just

00:52:00,010 --> 00:52:04,090
working a drupal site as well no need

00:52:02,230 --> 00:52:09,250
for ajax views plugins or anything like

00:52:04,090 --> 00:52:17,620
that and just yeah so just knowing that

00:52:09,250 --> 00:52:19,900
oops where am I yeah so just knowing

00:52:17,620 --> 00:52:22,660
that that stuff exists that stuffs out

00:52:19,900 --> 00:52:24,730
there that using twigs going to be huge

00:52:22,660 --> 00:52:25,930
having a template engine in core is

00:52:24,730 --> 00:52:28,750
going to be you know it's going to be a

00:52:25,930 --> 00:52:29,920
lot of big tool for us as front-end

00:52:28,750 --> 00:52:31,660
developer is we're going to be able to

00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:34,050
mix and match and do a lot of things

00:52:31,660 --> 00:52:37,780
with HTML and with client-side

00:52:34,050 --> 00:52:39,220
development and you know we're going to

00:52:37,780 --> 00:52:40,720
be able to do a lot of stuff so just

00:52:39,220 --> 00:52:42,760
knowing that those tool exists

00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:44,350
understanding that with the benefits of

00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:45,970
a style guide being able to catalog all

00:52:44,350 --> 00:52:48,340
of your components being able to iterate

00:52:45,970 --> 00:52:49,540
on a development team being able to show

00:52:48,340 --> 00:52:51,400
the client you know and show the

00:52:49,540 --> 00:52:53,920
designers think so we're not we're not

00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:55,240
you know rehashing all this work over

00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:57,580
and over over again and writing all this

00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:59,920
stuff time in and time again time in and

00:52:57,580 --> 00:53:02,260
time out is going to be really

00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:05,470
advantageous to us moving forward going

00:53:02,260 --> 00:53:07,540
in to Drupal 8 so I guess that's it for

00:53:05,470 --> 00:53:09,700
me you can find me on Twitter that's my

00:53:07,540 --> 00:53:12,540
name and yep thank you very much

00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:12,540
appreciate it

00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:23,579
does anybody have any questions this man

00:53:27,479 --> 00:53:32,049
yeah I use KSS for prototyping so

00:53:30,130 --> 00:53:33,789
whenever I get a new design and I just

00:53:32,049 --> 00:53:35,619
go into the style guide and I make it

00:53:33,789 --> 00:53:37,180
all in the style guide first so I don't

00:53:35,619 --> 00:53:39,219
make a whole site and the style guide I

00:53:37,180 --> 00:53:40,690
would never do that because you know you

00:53:39,219 --> 00:53:42,009
don't want to waste time the clients

00:53:40,690 --> 00:53:43,630
time and stuff you want doing like an

00:53:42,009 --> 00:53:46,839
agile sort of fashion so when the story

00:53:43,630 --> 00:53:48,779
comes in you just make the the HTML and

00:53:46,839 --> 00:53:50,890
CSS that has to do with that particular

00:53:48,779 --> 00:53:54,489
component you build that component and

00:53:50,890 --> 00:53:56,469
and then you prototype it and then you

00:53:54,489 --> 00:53:59,559
worry i'd estimate them separately so

00:53:56,469 --> 00:54:01,029
I'll estimate this the HTML and CSS and

00:53:59,559 --> 00:54:02,979
then the separate is the Drupal

00:54:01,029 --> 00:54:04,719
integration and then everybody can see

00:54:02,979 --> 00:54:06,609
the cost of Drupal what is Drupal cost

00:54:04,719 --> 00:54:08,109
what is the integration actually costing

00:54:06,609 --> 00:54:09,489
us because you shouldn't have to worry

00:54:08,109 --> 00:54:12,309
about Drupal when you're actually doing

00:54:09,489 --> 00:54:13,539
all the responsive stuff and performance

00:54:12,309 --> 00:54:15,369
and trying to figure out how the

00:54:13,539 --> 00:54:22,329
component should work in the browser the

00:54:15,369 --> 00:54:28,959
best pattern labs written in PHP but I

00:54:22,329 --> 00:54:30,369
think it's good yeah yeah I'm sure I

00:54:28,959 --> 00:54:31,749
haven't used pattern on so the question

00:54:30,369 --> 00:54:33,519
is you know whether case there's no it's

00:54:31,749 --> 00:54:36,910
similar to pattern lab I'm sure they

00:54:33,519 --> 00:54:39,940
have a lot of similarities and yeah I

00:54:36,910 --> 00:54:46,420
haven't used pattern lab extensively yes

00:54:39,940 --> 00:54:48,880
sir not yet but I don't see why not like

00:54:46,420 --> 00:54:50,920
once it's all set up it's really easy if

00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:53,619
you know just HTML and CSS you should be

00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:55,630
able to iterate on those doing

00:54:53,619 --> 00:54:57,849
presentation this presentations as much

00:54:55,630 --> 00:54:59,319
for people in my company as it is for

00:54:57,849 --> 00:55:01,239
the outside world because I'd like

00:54:59,319 --> 00:55:04,079
people to understand that the style

00:55:01,239 --> 00:55:06,609
guides is not just some you know some

00:55:04,079 --> 00:55:08,229
things and like colors and stuff on a

00:55:06,609 --> 00:55:09,699
page it's actually a really important

00:55:08,229 --> 00:55:11,140
development tool that can allow other

00:55:09,699 --> 00:55:12,609
employees may be people who don't have

00:55:11,140 --> 00:55:16,109
experience with Drupal to do half the

00:55:12,609 --> 00:55:16,109
work on the project

00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:27,220
yeah interesting yeah yes sir

00:55:29,150 --> 00:55:35,880
good question I've tried I would put the

00:55:32,250 --> 00:55:39,210
energy if oh I'm sorry my bad so the

00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:40,770
question is is whether or not I put the

00:55:39,210 --> 00:55:43,800
images that have to do with the

00:55:40,770 --> 00:55:45,180
component in the component folder and if

00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:47,490
it's like a background image that has

00:55:45,180 --> 00:55:50,190
something specifically to do with that

00:55:47,490 --> 00:55:52,200
component then I would do that or if

00:55:50,190 --> 00:55:54,570
it's a placeholder image that has to do

00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:56,430
with the demonstration and the testing

00:55:54,570 --> 00:55:58,500
and documentation of a component I would

00:55:56,430 --> 00:55:59,700
put the images in the folder but then

00:55:58,500 --> 00:56:01,170
you're going to have to reconcile that

00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:02,730
you're going to have to reconcile the

00:56:01,170 --> 00:56:04,830
paths you're going to have to deal with

00:56:02,730 --> 00:56:06,660
the tooling and how it's pulling the

00:56:04,830 --> 00:56:08,550
image out and whether the path is

00:56:06,660 --> 00:56:09,960
absolute or relative and there's still

00:56:08,550 --> 00:56:11,570
problems moving forward but hopefully

00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:13,290
the tooling will get better and

00:56:11,570 --> 00:56:21,230
standards will get better around

00:56:13,290 --> 00:56:24,120
building things like this anyone else

00:56:21,230 --> 00:56:34,250
all right thank you very much appreciate

00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:34,250
it yeah sure

00:56:38,770 --> 00:56:43,520
it's like right now you could write a

00:56:41,090 --> 00:56:45,860
fist again and put your grid or

00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:48,950
something you're great HTML into a maybe

00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:50,270
a hundred but it's still a bit annoying

00:56:48,950 --> 00:56:51,770
to read it you snuck in and then you

00:56:50,270 --> 00:56:54,320
cannot use it if you have for instance

00:56:51,770 --> 00:56:55,700
few titles and just want a feel for

00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:58,400
matter with food items and you cannot

00:56:55,700 --> 00:57:01,010
use the same great or whatever it happen

00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:04,330
and so what I am doing this I think I

00:57:01,010 --> 00:57:04,330
think we're writing a bunch of different

00:57:05,290 --> 00:57:24,010
now yeah right now you just have this to

00:57:24,430 --> 00:57:32,050
each one of the different options yeah

00:57:26,990 --> 00:57:32,050
