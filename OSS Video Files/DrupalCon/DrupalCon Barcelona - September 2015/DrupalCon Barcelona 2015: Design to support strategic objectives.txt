Title: DrupalCon Barcelona 2015: Design to support strategic objectives
Publication date: 2015-09-22
Playlist: DrupalCon Barcelona - September 2015
Description: 
	Of course, design is more about putting on the nice colors and fonts.
But then, what *do* you need to design for impact?

We'll look at the Double Diamond as a handy format for capturing all the activities and prerequisites for design that serves user needs *and* supports your clients strategic objectives.

With the context of this framework we'll then look at the specific activities and deliverables that help the transition and collaboration from design to development:

- Getting a shared understanding of the project goal
- The value of content modelling
- Prototyping & usability testing

I

00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:17,140
yes

00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:52,170
you

00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:08,450
okay it's about time to get started so

00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:15,020
thanks all for coming what's on the menu

00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:18,049
for today at least for this session the

00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:22,100
usual hellos but what I want to talk to

00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:25,940
you about was a kind of a strategic

00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:27,920
design framework that we can use to help

00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:32,090
define the strategy for a product

00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:34,970
service or projects and how then design

00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:37,160
as a craft can help make that strategy

00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:41,180
more concrete and specific so that we

00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:43,280
can actually make it happen so we're

00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:47,590
going to go over the framework a model

00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:51,550
for that approach and once we've done

00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:54,440
theoretical bit we'll look at some

00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:56,120
practical more deliverable focused

00:04:54,440 --> 00:05:03,560
things that you can do to get started

00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:07,160
with this approach my name is Royce

00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:10,820
Holton I work for window crowds in the

00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:13,400
Benelux as UX designer and I'm also a

00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:17,230
longtime Drupal core UX designer and

00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:20,030
contributor so I work a lot with

00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:24,040
designers and developers at the same

00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:24,040
time in the team's and with clients and

00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:32,770
boy are we busy making all the things so

00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:35,030
of course designer and developer

00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:38,630
collaboration is a hot topic these days

00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:40,970
and has been for a while now and we've

00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:43,370
basically already agreed that we don't

00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:46,070
want to keep throwing Photoshop files

00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:48,620
over the wall to get them implemented we

00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:52,100
want component based layouts and modular

00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:54,350
style guides and getting coders and

00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:58,610
architects involved sooner so that we

00:05:54,350 --> 00:06:01,910
can make the right decisions all that

00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:07,100
jazz but even if we agree on all of that

00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:10,560
there are still challenges right the

00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:13,470
designer has some kind of input

00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:15,419
from that the developer is supposed to

00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:17,700
make something that there is shippable

00:06:15,419 --> 00:06:24,919
and there's there's a couple of

00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:28,320
differences in that design is explored

00:06:24,919 --> 00:06:30,780
it diverges it creates multiple options

00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:32,910
through sketching and the starting point

00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:37,500
is this whatever kind of plan and we'll

00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:39,180
talk about the plan a bit later but

00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:41,870
there's a plan or a briefing for the

00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:44,639
project and from there the designer

00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:47,310
generates multiple options sketchings

00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:49,290
mock-ups reworks and then the three or

00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:51,600
four revision rounds that were agreed

00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:53,940
upon in the contract but there's not

00:06:51,600 --> 00:07:00,330
there's always multiple designs being

00:06:53,940 --> 00:07:02,669
generated before development can do its

00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:04,410
thing and development has to be

00:07:02,669 --> 00:07:06,840
convergent because what we're actually

00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:09,060
going to build has to be that one

00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:12,180
shippable release that we're working

00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:15,560
towards so the work or the spec needs to

00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:19,050
be unambiguous and very specific and

00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:23,100
those are two very different mindsets

00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:25,220
they're not exclusive I mean people can

00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:28,020
have them both or switch between those

00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:32,640
but that difference in approach that's

00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:34,800
the thing but in the end together we of

00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:37,440
course iterate towards the right

00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:41,820
solution based on the plan we get to

00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:43,590
something shippable so at this drupalcon

00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:46,080
you probably have a lot of sessions

00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:48,419
where we whether it be lots to learn

00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:52,860
about this process about how to design

00:07:48,419 --> 00:07:55,229
and build the things the right way but

00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:57,360
today I want to talk about up about how

00:07:55,229 --> 00:07:59,430
you can help ensure that you're spending

00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:03,510
time and energy on building the right

00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:04,830
thing so what can we do to know that

00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:06,840
we're building the right things that

00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:09,870
we're spending our energy and resources

00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:17,180
on yeah the right thing in the first

00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:17,180
place so yeah Mike Tyson notwithstanding

00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:23,569
there is this plan something that

00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:28,669
catches and that gets you started

00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:31,029
start creating a design but designing

00:08:28,669 --> 00:08:34,699
and building that solution that this

00:08:31,029 --> 00:08:37,490
equal to providing an answer to a

00:08:34,699 --> 00:08:40,729
question right so then the question

00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:43,060
comes who has where does this play this

00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:47,180
plan come from what is this question

00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:50,120
what happened so that this input we got

00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:53,360
for design and build became the plan in

00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:55,699
first place so what happens before we

00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:57,170
get to designing and solution get to

00:08:55,699 --> 00:09:05,620
designing and building a solution what

00:08:57,170 --> 00:09:08,420
was this question so this is basically

00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:11,269
one way of framing what a UX designers

00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:14,720
job is bring these three worlds together

00:09:11,269 --> 00:09:17,259
the organization has it's the client the

00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:19,970
organization has its business goals

00:09:17,259 --> 00:09:21,500
technology provides the possibilities

00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:26,120
and the constraints of what we can do

00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:28,639
and design represents in most cases the

00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:32,540
user so what does the customer what does

00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:35,740
the user in need from this thing and in

00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:38,300
the overlap of these three domains

00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:41,649
there's the potential for a successful

00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:41,649
project or products

00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:50,240
and in this talk although design usually

00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:52,760
should be focusing on representing the

00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,740
user I want them more highlight what

00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:57,770
questions we should be asking to

00:09:54,740 --> 00:10:03,440
highlight what the business needs are

00:09:57,770 --> 00:10:06,050
when you're starting a project and for

00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:08,000
becoming successful there so in that

00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:10,280
middle there that's where the overlap is

00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:16,310
that's where basically the plan should

00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:20,150
be defined so what I want to talk to you

00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:22,820
about is the framework we call it the

00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:25,760
double diamonds we've seen the first

00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:28,520
part of it the design and the develop

00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:32,330
phases based on a plan getting to

00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:37,490
something shippable if we move that to

00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:40,250
the right a bit then you see that we

00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:42,290
first have indeed to define the problem

00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:47,450
or the opportunity what is the question

00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:50,740
and from there so there's an initial

00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:53,600
insight there's an initial trigger that

00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:56,890
requires that there should be a project

00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:59,090
there's an opportunity to do something

00:10:56,890 --> 00:11:01,130
from that insight we have to then

00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:06,490
discover why we should be doing

00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:09,860
something with it and then define how we

00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:14,240
take on that challenge our solve that

00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:16,760
problem from there we get a plan so the

00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:20,000
discover define design develop roots

00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:23,150
those are probably not unfamiliar words

00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:26,180
every agency has its version of this

00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:32,030
process but will walk to through this

00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:36,290
one in a bit more detail definition and

00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:39,400
execution so what do we define first so

00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:39,400
that we can execute on it

00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:51,660
so first the actual insight there's this

00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:53,730
initial trigger right there's this can

00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:57,000
and often should be based on insights

00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:59,880
learn to glean from the user research we

00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:02,160
got a good example of this this morning

00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:05,370
at the keynote where a usability test

00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:07,740
provides good input for knowing what we

00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:09,930
should be working on but there's

00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:12,209
business reasons as well and it's a good

00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:16,529
idea to find out that perspective as

00:12:12,209 --> 00:12:18,329
well if you're starting a project so can

00:12:16,529 --> 00:12:20,430
we know what is the reason this project

00:12:18,329 --> 00:12:21,870
got approved do we know the project

00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:29,430
sponsor is and what is the high level

00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:31,110
goal so luckily businesses are basically

00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:34,260
quite simple creatures they stay in

00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:37,500
business by either or increasing revenue

00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:40,170
so selling more of the thing they

00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:42,720
decrease costs or making it cheaper to

00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:47,850
produce and sell the thing they can

00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:50,820
increase by creating new business so

00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:52,500
finding new customers and they can

00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:54,600
increase existing business by selling

00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:57,390
more of the thing to the customers they

00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:59,339
already have and that's the last bit

00:12:57,390 --> 00:13:01,399
more complicated one increase

00:12:59,339 --> 00:13:03,660
shareholder value so that's obvious but

00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:05,610
for now let's say that's basically about

00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:11,570
making sure the business can survive in

00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:11,570
the long term but you can imagine that

00:13:12,529 --> 00:13:19,230
if you can ask these questions are we

00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:21,449
here to increase revenue or are we here

00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:26,339
to decrease costs that's a whole

00:13:21,449 --> 00:13:27,810
different project if we want to increase

00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:29,430
new business that means that we are

00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:32,220
looking for new customers that's

00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:37,140
probably more an innovative project then

00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:39,930
in decreased costs which is a project to

00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:43,170
optimize the existing processes and just

00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:45,570
reducing costs so knowing this if we're

00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:50,190
trying to innovate or trying to renovate

00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:52,260
or just trying to slim down the existing

00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:55,279
stuff makes a big difference in the

00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:55,279
approach you're going to take

00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:05,660
another question to ask you this pose at

00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:11,420
this point is what is the main purpose

00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:14,540
of this site is it a sales channel is it

00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:17,899
for customer service is for brand

00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:20,660
awareness is it educational for

00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:22,339
entertainment very simple basic

00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:26,110
questions but good to have on your

00:14:22,339 --> 00:14:29,360
checklist when you're discussing the

00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:35,420
potential project road discussing this

00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:38,750
project so that's the kind of things you

00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:42,740
can ask when when finding the reason

00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:49,130
that we're even having this project the

00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:51,820
discovery phase is about finding out why

00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:54,350
we should be even acting on that inside

00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:56,510
so we have to build a rationale we have

00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:58,040
to ask her answer the question why we

00:14:56,510 --> 00:15:00,470
should be doing something something

00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:03,949
about this so we have to basically

00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:07,970
framed opportunity so you to discover

00:15:03,949 --> 00:15:11,019
why and that means that we need to get

00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:14,800
clear about the market a customer and

00:15:11,019 --> 00:15:14,800
the product strategy

00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:25,210
what do these mean for the market that

00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:26,920
means who are the competitors so who are

00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:31,270
you competing with what are the other

00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:33,240
organizations doing the same thing how

00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:37,150
are they different I do you they

00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:41,080
positioned ourselves how what makes them

00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:45,070
unique and can we tell if there are any

00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:48,970
trends in the market that should inform

00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:51,820
what we are going to do a lot of this

00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:55,660
information it's often already available

00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:59,080
in the organization right the point is

00:15:55,660 --> 00:16:03,910
to ask your client to provide you with

00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:05,650
that information as well we also have

00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:08,140
customers do we know for whom we are

00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:10,630
doing this is this a new target audience

00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:13,570
this is an existing audience big

00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:16,270
difference who are these people and what

00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:18,520
do they want to get done so for knowing

00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:21,570
learning about who the customers are of

00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:24,690
course there's the personas the

00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:27,910
characteristic descriptions profiles of

00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:32,529
archetypical users there's user feedback

00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:36,130
through whatever surveys or customer

00:16:32,529 --> 00:16:37,690
service calls that gets locked that we

00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:39,550
can know what the customers are really

00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:42,300
looking for and of course there's

00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:45,459
analytics data so this is input for

00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:51,940
knowing why we should who the customers

00:16:45,459 --> 00:16:55,120
are and if you know the context of the

00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:57,430
market I know what the customers are in

00:16:55,120 --> 00:17:00,640
that context we can make some first

00:16:57,430 --> 00:17:05,410
high-level descriptions of the product

00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:10,530
strategy so lots of bit more buzz words

00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:13,059
than value proposition so now we're

00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:15,540
starting to write our first outline of

00:17:13,059 --> 00:17:19,059
what this project of products could be

00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:21,850
the value proposition is what is the

00:17:19,059 --> 00:17:24,069
promise of the value that this product

00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:25,900
or service will provide to the customer

00:17:24,069 --> 00:17:29,600
and doing it in such a way that the

00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:34,610
customer actually experiences it as

00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:38,000
you the best way to word it is to be

00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:42,919
able to do it in in a single tweet so

00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:45,500
can you formulate what this project will

00:17:42,919 --> 00:17:47,240
do for you in a single tweet then if

00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:49,429
you've got that and you've got the core

00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:54,080
of what the project should should be

00:17:49,429 --> 00:17:57,500
doing for you from that context you can

00:17:54,080 --> 00:18:00,530
then start say okay that means do we

00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:03,350
need this and this and this feature and

00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:11,750
we can prioritize the initial scope or

00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:13,280
plan for what we need to be making so in

00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:15,260
answering the first question why we

00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,760
should be doing something with this we

00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:21,320
need to get a picture of the market the

00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:22,940
customer and a product strategy and the

00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:25,159
client offer knows about market and

00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:28,850
maybe also about product strategy and

00:18:25,159 --> 00:18:31,159
it's often that UX designers find that

00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:33,830
they may need some help with getting

00:18:31,159 --> 00:18:37,640
there the picture of the image of the

00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:41,539
persona or the customer better getting

00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:43,760
it right but we want to ask these

00:18:41,539 --> 00:18:45,789
markets and product strategy questions

00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:49,130
as well it's not necessarily our job to

00:18:45,789 --> 00:18:52,610
help them define those but we want to

00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:58,340
know so that we can get a direction for

00:18:52,610 --> 00:19:01,270
what we're going to do okay so if we

00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:03,409
have answered why and we want to proceed

00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:06,440
and we have to start formulating the

00:19:03,409 --> 00:19:09,280
plan define how we're going to solve

00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:12,530
this problem or take up this challenge

00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:14,390
so we now have a more or less solid

00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:16,820
grasp on why it's a good idea to pursue

00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:19,340
this project we want to now define how

00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:24,169
to tackle that you do that with

00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:28,640
developing a concept so a visual and

00:19:24,169 --> 00:19:30,590
interaction contact you define an

00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:35,740
experience strategy and you define a

00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:35,740
content strategy what are those

00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:41,880
so for official and interaction concept

00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:44,460
that means that we do design mockups we

00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:47,640
create vision pieces this is not the

00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:51,570
actual Photoshop file of the homepage

00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:54,770
but this is the larger image of it's

00:19:51,570 --> 00:20:00,000
going to be something cool like this a

00:19:54,770 --> 00:20:02,820
vision piece for the interaction part we

00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,940
want to do maybe want to do customer

00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:09,570
journey maps Krista Jeremy map customer

00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:11,100
journey maps are basically plotting all

00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:13,140
the anchor actions physical and digital

00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:16,050
that a customer can have with the

00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:18,960
product or service so that starts with

00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:22,620
seeing in a advertisement for a new

00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:25,560
dishwasher somewhere in the on the

00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:27,840
street to looking that machine up in the

00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:30,450
store to ordering it online and to

00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:33,300
finding the customer support phone

00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:35,940
number of the two years when the thing

00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:37,680
needs a repair so it's the big picture

00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:40,020
of all the possible interactions the

00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:42,420
customer can have with the product or

00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:43,920
service that we're designing so it's

00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:48,570
very good for finding out where exactly

00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:50,820
you can be most effective because people

00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:53,310
get more or less happy at certain points

00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:58,290
in their journey and where they're less

00:20:53,310 --> 00:21:01,530
happy we can maybe do something on a

00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:05,060
similar but somewhat smaller scale that

00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:07,980
we find the main scenario so what are

00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:11,690
the main scenarios that we have to

00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:13,920
provide have to enable in our project a

00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:16,890
scenario is basically what happens at

00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:19,500
one of those points interactions in the

00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:22,140
journey so for now let's consider that

00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:24,830
this just from the digital or online

00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:29,490
perspective that mean in the dishwasher

00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:32,010
example are just choosing selecting an

00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:33,900
ordering process work how does making an

00:21:32,010 --> 00:21:38,850
appointment for getting the repair

00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:40,680
appointment done those are scenarios

00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:42,900
within the larger customer journey and

00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:46,500
you want to create an inventory of all

00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:47,490
the scenarios you need to provide you

00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:51,179
want to prioritize

00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:52,710
to us as well so that your are visual

00:21:51,179 --> 00:21:57,440
and interaction concept how would it

00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:57,440
look how will it feel how will it behave

00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:09,060
not a part of it of the how is ok what's

00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:12,190
the content strategy going to be we have

00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:15,550
look we have feel that we have content

00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:17,290
as well right and for the content

00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:19,660
strategy we have to define so what is

00:22:17,290 --> 00:22:22,510
the messaging architecture basically are

00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:26,760
the key messages what is the core of the

00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:30,160
contents like we have basic in key

00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:32,500
scenarios we also need to establish what

00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:34,720
are the main the key messages that we

00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:38,170
need to communicate what do we want

00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:40,090
people to take away from us and what is

00:22:38,170 --> 00:22:42,160
the tone of voice what is basically the

00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:44,230
style of that content where's the tone

00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:52,450
of voice is witty and playful or serious

00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:56,830
business or something in between and a

00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:58,240
third part of the how question is we

00:22:56,830 --> 00:23:01,780
want to define something of an

00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:05,550
experience strategy an experience

00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:07,750
strategy consists of design principles

00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:10,450
what are design principles there are

00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:12,220
guidelines or rules of thumb for making

00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:14,290
design decisions even further down the

00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:17,620
road the more detailed ones that we

00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:20,200
can't even foresee now design principles

00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:23,650
can help you still make consider trade

00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:27,580
offs and make consistent choices so a

00:23:23,650 --> 00:23:29,800
very typical example of a design

00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:33,100
principle would be that Google has one

00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:35,080
for speed over everything just with the

00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:38,260
rule of thumb of speed over everything

00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:41,380
enables them to make micro decisions in

00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:43,360
whatever you I further down the road in

00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:45,270
whatever product if the design principle

00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:48,070
applies and they have multiple options

00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:50,580
they can ask which one is the fastest

00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:54,760
that's the one we're going to take

00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:58,330
similar with Drupal 7 we had a pretty

00:23:54,760 --> 00:24:01,720
serious UX effort there and likewise

00:23:58,330 --> 00:24:03,340
there were design principles defines one

00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:08,200
of those was designed for the eighty

00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:12,880
percent so make often perform tasks easy

00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:15,670
to do make the rest doable or we also

00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:18,460
decided that provide better defaults

00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:20,440
would be a good idea we didn't really

00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:24,700
do it it was one of the design

00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:27,580
principles so design principles are very

00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:31,720
useful rules of thumb that you can

00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:35,260
define from the outset will help you

00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:37,240
make decisions that take care of a

00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:42,310
certain kind of consistency in the

00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:44,260
design and ideally you can also agree on

00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:50,560
what are we going to measure so that we

00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:52,930
know that we're successful so if we go

00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:56,230
on formulate the plan there's an

00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:57,970
experience strategy sorry as a visual

00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:59,560
interaction concept there's a content

00:24:57,970 --> 00:25:01,810
strategy and there's an experience

00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:06,940
strategy in place so that's enough

00:25:01,810 --> 00:25:11,020
strategy for now so we render part where

00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:13,420
we say okay so that's the plan what is

00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:17,190
in the plan all of the above just what

00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:20,290
we talked through put in a roadmap or

00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:23,890
maybe a prioritized backlog depends on

00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:25,630
how big the projects the services but we

00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:27,990
have a plan now for how to evolve the

00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:27,990
product

00:25:36,029 --> 00:25:42,529
okay so based on the plan we're going in

00:25:39,229 --> 00:25:47,789
maybe some more familiar territory I'll

00:25:42,529 --> 00:25:50,340
do this a bit shorter but the design and

00:25:47,789 --> 00:25:53,340
the development are both about how so if

00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:59,820
you know why and what we can now dive

00:25:53,340 --> 00:26:01,649
into how are we going to do this again

00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:04,590
this needs content this needs visual

00:26:01,649 --> 00:26:07,440
design this needs interaction design so

00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:10,259
for the content that would mean that we

00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:12,450
find out what the site map will be but

00:26:10,259 --> 00:26:15,509
we find out what the content model is

00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:18,299
going to be and we make decision about

00:26:15,509 --> 00:26:21,960
the information design so how do we

00:26:18,299 --> 00:26:24,929
actually present the information for the

00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:28,999
visual design we go sketching we create

00:26:24,929 --> 00:26:31,830
the style tiles and the mock-ups that

00:26:28,999 --> 00:26:34,979
further detail the actual look and feel

00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:37,259
of the of the application have for the

00:26:34,979 --> 00:26:40,889
interaction design the well-known

00:26:37,259 --> 00:26:45,869
wireframes prototypes and usability

00:26:40,889 --> 00:26:48,679
testing help us figure out the how of

00:26:45,869 --> 00:26:48,679
this project

00:26:53,880 --> 00:27:01,650
so if the design is there at least in

00:26:58,890 --> 00:27:04,350
other of it is there we can start

00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:07,650
develop it and even develop means that

00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:09,210
even more detailed design it may be

00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:12,330
necessary all the necessary components

00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:15,630
all the bits and pieces that make make

00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:17,370
up to you I of course preferably

00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:20,570
component-based and with a style guide

00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:25,820
instead of those eight or 23 Photoshop

00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:28,620
documents we get to a content production

00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:31,680
writing the actual content right

00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:34,470
creating the actual imagery creating the

00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:37,140
right photos audio-visual material if

00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:40,710
needed so we're doing production here

00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:42,840
and yes this is a UX focused thing so

00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:46,670
and as some code to be written as well

00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:49,500
of course and this back-end code

00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:52,260
implements for example the content model

00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:54,000
and some functionality and the front-end

00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:56,400
implements the design right and the

00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,640
behavior defined in the interaction

00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,640
design

00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:12,400
and then it really iteratively we can

00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:14,260
ship and of course get to do it all over

00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:22,660
again for the next release over the next

00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:24,790
version so this is the double diamonds

00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:30,280
is what we just went through an initial

00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:33,010
trigger and inside there where we have

00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:35,470
to answer the question why should be

00:28:33,010 --> 00:28:40,780
doing why should we be doing something

00:28:35,470 --> 00:28:43,060
with this define basically the plan for

00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:45,070
how to going to tackle this design

00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:48,190
multiple solutions multiple options

00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:54,610
generate multiple solutions from where

00:28:48,190 --> 00:29:00,130
we can decide what to build so define

00:28:54,610 --> 00:29:03,820
first execute second so now we're back

00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:07,420
to the point in the middle how to define

00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:10,030
that better plan because we talk through

00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:15,070
the steps in the possible steps in the

00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:19,660
first half to double diamonds what can

00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:23,080
we do to create a better plan so two

00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:26,430
things how can we make a roadmap and how

00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:26,430
do we write a good project brief

00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:37,659
so how do you create an initial roadmap

00:29:34,389 --> 00:29:40,990
in this discovery definition phase as

00:29:37,659 --> 00:29:45,490
part basically at the end resulting in a

00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:46,690
plan so the good idea about the roadmap

00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:48,399
is that it helps with setting

00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:51,610
expectations in a world where there's

00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:53,610
never enough money or time to do it all

00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:55,690
you need to chunk up to work and

00:29:53,610 --> 00:29:58,740
sequence it in a way that makes sense

00:29:55,690 --> 00:30:03,960
and makes your client successful and

00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:03,960
gets you to success as soon as possible

00:30:04,049 --> 00:30:09,010
so what you want to do is gather all the

00:30:06,370 --> 00:30:12,700
insights gather all the usability

00:30:09,010 --> 00:30:18,700
testing inputs getting all the strategic

00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:21,490
input from the organization itself group

00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:24,700
those in themes so just put the related

00:30:21,490 --> 00:30:27,669
stuff together and from there you can

00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:31,990
identify potential projects so if this

00:30:27,669 --> 00:30:34,059
group makes sense then okay what would

00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:36,070
be a good drupal current project yeah

00:30:34,059 --> 00:30:38,019
we're seeing that lots of people are

00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:40,090
failing because there's no on-ramp

00:30:38,019 --> 00:30:45,039
because there's no we don't provide them

00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:47,200
with with a with a guiding with a

00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:49,690
guiding hand and getting the first steps

00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:51,460
so there's there's a potential project

00:30:49,690 --> 00:30:53,519
there that we need to do and better on

00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:55,690
to on ramping in Drupal core for example

00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:57,940
so there's a couple of ideas for that

00:30:55,690 --> 00:31:00,010
and that would be project a we will have

00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:04,360
project B which is related to some other

00:31:00,010 --> 00:31:09,309
related efforts or problems and so we

00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:12,610
create a list of potential projects we

00:31:09,309 --> 00:31:16,299
want to rate those projects we want to

00:31:12,610 --> 00:31:19,360
rate them along the pain that is being

00:31:16,299 --> 00:31:24,029
felt by the customer we want to rate

00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:28,059
them for the effort required to solve it

00:31:24,029 --> 00:31:31,169
we want to rate it by the value that it

00:31:28,059 --> 00:31:31,169
might bring to the organization

00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:37,049
so what do we do a three by three

00:31:37,410 --> 00:31:44,710
opportunity so very painful at the top

00:31:40,330 --> 00:31:48,520
left not so painful but quite confusing

00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:51,070
in the middle and no pain but we see an

00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:55,570
opportunity for a real improvement at

00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:57,820
the bottom effort on the bottom small

00:31:55,570 --> 00:32:01,049
effort medium effort large effort just

00:31:57,820 --> 00:32:03,640
getting it done timing-wise resources

00:32:01,049 --> 00:32:11,200
and from there you can then plot the

00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:14,740
projects and well you see the costs of

00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:16,480
getting it done is defined by the Euro

00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:20,290
signs on the on the dots and we can

00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:23,799
scale the dots so if you map the

00:32:20,290 --> 00:32:27,730
potential projects in this way you can

00:32:23,799 --> 00:32:31,929
then say okay where there's small effort

00:32:27,730 --> 00:32:36,400
needed to fix real pain we have quick

00:32:31,929 --> 00:32:41,080
wins we need to improve the confusing

00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:46,630
bit and the opportunities are the

00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:48,850
innovative efforts we can do so if we

00:32:46,630 --> 00:32:50,500
seek instead because we want people to

00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:53,590
be we want to apply and to become

00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:55,630
successful quickly and then we can then

00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:59,309
schedule the work and chunk it up and

00:32:55,630 --> 00:33:03,520
start with fixing the low-hanging fruit

00:32:59,309 --> 00:33:07,799
improve certain certain things and then

00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:07,799
look into where do we start innovating

00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:14,830
so that's one way a simple way to create

00:33:11,370 --> 00:33:19,679
an initial roadmap for what you want to

00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:19,679
do in the projects are in the product

00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:28,039
but maybe you're not in a position

00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:30,980
really to contribute to the roadmap

00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:34,490
maybe you're a bit further down in the

00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:37,490
process you're not really at that table

00:33:34,490 --> 00:33:39,799
where this road map is being made and

00:33:37,490 --> 00:33:42,740
you still want to define for yourself at

00:33:39,799 --> 00:33:48,470
the very least kind of short form

00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:50,450
project brief so if you can do nothing

00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:52,760
else but ask these questions we've been

00:33:50,450 --> 00:33:57,049
talking about and you have to select the

00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:59,990
minimal set of those you would ask for

00:33:57,049 --> 00:34:01,639
the business objectives what are we

00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:04,460
trying to achieve why are waiting list

00:34:01,639 --> 00:34:07,639
is answering the Y for whom are we doing

00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:09,349
this what are those people trying to do

00:34:07,639 --> 00:34:13,010
so what are the main scenarios that we

00:34:09,349 --> 00:34:15,530
have to enable and can we define some

00:34:13,010 --> 00:34:17,329
design principles so that we have some

00:34:15,530 --> 00:34:20,359
rules of thumb that we can make

00:34:17,329 --> 00:34:22,429
consistent decisions of based off

00:34:20,359 --> 00:34:24,829
because design is not about getting a

00:34:22,429 --> 00:34:27,980
perfect design is about getting making

00:34:24,829 --> 00:34:29,629
the right trade-offs and design

00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:31,780
principles as explained to help you

00:34:29,629 --> 00:34:31,780
there

00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:50,490
okay so roadmap much grief let's talk a

00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:56,509
bit at one more level practical about

00:34:50,490 --> 00:34:56,509
deliverables see

00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:10,359
two exercises or and deliverables that

00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:14,400
are not the more standard wireframes and

00:35:10,359 --> 00:35:14,400
side maps that you may come to expect

00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:22,390
because I often see in and with the

00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:25,270
developers that when they get static

00:35:22,390 --> 00:35:27,540
wireframes they have to reverse engineer

00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:31,560
where all the things are coming from

00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:37,359
what's all on the page is a mishmash of

00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:39,280
fields blocks etc they have to reverse

00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:44,700
engineer where I do all these bits and

00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:47,770
pieces come from because there's now

00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:51,160
basically never a single source what's

00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:55,690
for what's shown on this page so what

00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:58,230
can you do what can you help define that

00:35:55,690 --> 00:36:01,480
makes that work easier that's the

00:35:58,230 --> 00:36:04,000
content model and this is something

00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:05,230
that's so natural to Drupal that we take

00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,990
it for granted but this is actually

00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:10,990
quite quite powerful and we you should

00:36:07,990 --> 00:36:13,240
make that in you shouldn't but it's

00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:15,040
really useful to make that a concrete

00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:19,119
specific discussion with your clients

00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:21,609
and the developer team because it's a

00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:23,319
really effective way to discuss what

00:36:21,609 --> 00:36:25,839
needs to go into side into the site and

00:36:23,319 --> 00:36:29,410
how that is structured so what's in a

00:36:25,839 --> 00:36:31,900
Content model you know this one this is

00:36:29,410 --> 00:36:33,970
a typical example of a recipe right it

00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:36,700
recipe has fields as we know em into a

00:36:33,970 --> 00:36:38,740
pole and has relations relationships

00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:44,619
with other content types like related

00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:47,079
recipes related menus reviews so you get

00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:48,819
the idea of a Content model yeah this is

00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:51,339
a single come to type and its relations

00:36:48,819 --> 00:36:55,990
so what's in a Content model it defines

00:36:51,339 --> 00:36:58,839
the different content types the fields

00:36:55,990 --> 00:37:03,339
that are in each content type and the

00:36:58,839 --> 00:37:05,349
relationships between content types this

00:37:03,339 --> 00:37:07,450
is very obvious for anybody in working

00:37:05,349 --> 00:37:08,500
with Drupal if you make that specific

00:37:07,450 --> 00:37:10,900
with your client you can have a

00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:12,430
discussion like so you're working with a

00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:16,720
special interest group

00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:18,820
that is pushing for some agenda and you

00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:22,000
can talking you can start talking with

00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:25,300
them about content not design but you

00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,860
can call it their site you go through

00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:28,300
what they have now and we know what you

00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:30,250
want to achieve Andy and you can talk

00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:32,050
about mmm I'm seeing that you have

00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:33,910
contact that is related to the industry

00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:36,610
this looks like industry topics makes

00:37:33,910 --> 00:37:38,650
sense and that's something else like

00:37:36,610 --> 00:37:41,140
then what you're writing for for your

00:37:38,650 --> 00:37:42,820
concert for your consumer audience we

00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:46,900
could do it with tagging but looks like

00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:48,910
they're two quite distinct things and I

00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:51,100
see that you have a lot of audio visual

00:37:48,910 --> 00:37:53,800
assets maybe we need a resource library

00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:55,420
we need media assets is would it be said

00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:59,440
is that a separate thing do you agree

00:37:55,420 --> 00:38:00,850
yes yes I agree we have news yes and we

00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:04,170
have training an event so that's

00:38:00,850 --> 00:38:07,810
probably a separate content type as well

00:38:04,170 --> 00:38:10,260
and from there you can go maybe a bit

00:38:07,810 --> 00:38:12,730
deeper so if there's a collective

00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:15,220
industry topics there and a collective

00:38:12,730 --> 00:38:20,050
consumer topics and we can start to talk

00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:23,440
okay so what's a single topic then set a

00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:26,740
content type yes probably and how does

00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:29,470
it work well it's it's it's own thing

00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:32,710
with us a certain number of fields but

00:38:29,470 --> 00:38:36,760
it also wants to point to facts and

00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:40,360
figures or reports or media assets that

00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:43,360
we have in the resource library yes that

00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:48,430
make sense and from there you can detail

00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:50,650
the content model a bit more and if you

00:38:48,430 --> 00:38:53,740
go another step where you start defining

00:38:50,650 --> 00:38:55,360
the actual fields that's where the good

00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:58,510
old spreadsheets come in of course and

00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:59,920
that's where maybe the client doesn't

00:38:58,510 --> 00:39:03,640
need to get one to be involved anymore

00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:05,410
but this is a much more useful input for

00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:07,930
the developer or the site builder on

00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:10,150
what he needs to start with what are the

00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:16,360
basic materials that from which we can

00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:18,780
create those nice layouts so if you

00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:21,760
start simple

00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:24,850
just outlining the main different kinds

00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:27,100
of chunks of content you see in somebody

00:39:24,850 --> 00:39:29,950
site or application you make that a

00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:32,350
discussion with the client you can you

00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:36,280
get very specific about what's important

00:39:32,350 --> 00:39:40,720
to have you can details a bit more what

00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:43,120
the relationship should be and then take

00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:45,130
it to a spreadsheet and find out how we

00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:49,180
can import that to Drupal in the easiest

00:39:45,130 --> 00:39:51,580
way but this is a much more actionable

00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:54,460
input for the site build or developer

00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:57,130
than the wireframes where like I said

00:39:54,460 --> 00:40:00,340
they have to reverse engineer where

00:39:57,130 --> 00:40:03,490
things are coming from so very basic

00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:05,620
taking for granted Drupal concepts but

00:40:03,490 --> 00:40:08,380
make it a split explicit with with your

00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:11,040
client and they'll have very useful

00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:11,040
conversations

00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:20,529
another thing you want to might want to

00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:25,020
consider is instead of the static

00:40:20,529 --> 00:40:25,020
wireframes again doing the prototyping

00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:30,700
because especially if we're talking

00:40:28,299 --> 00:40:32,950
about scenarios then it's about the flow

00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:35,289
and it's not about individual screens

00:40:32,950 --> 00:40:38,970
but how we can make people work through

00:40:35,289 --> 00:40:41,950
a sequence of those screens and

00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:44,500
wireframes especially printed ones are

00:40:41,950 --> 00:40:46,930
not going to really simulate it very

00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:50,079
well and it's in the simulation that did

00:40:46,930 --> 00:40:52,029
you have real value there so a prototype

00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:55,210
and you may decide for yourself what

00:40:52,029 --> 00:40:57,730
tool kit you're going to use be it HTML

00:40:55,210 --> 00:41:00,240
the clickable wireframes maybe or even

00:40:57,730 --> 00:41:04,059
quick and dirty drupal configurations

00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:08,559
but a prototype early sample something

00:41:04,059 --> 00:41:11,529
to throw away but it's built to test now

00:41:08,559 --> 00:41:13,119
has a thing to be learned from those are

00:41:11,529 --> 00:41:19,049
two very important benefits for

00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:21,279
prototyping over wire framing because

00:41:19,049 --> 00:41:24,339
it's easier to understand if you can

00:41:21,279 --> 00:41:26,440
actually use it any more people can

00:41:24,339 --> 00:41:28,779
understand what's what's the idea behind

00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:32,890
is and if they understand it better you

00:41:28,779 --> 00:41:35,079
can they can get you better feedback if

00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:38,109
we choose HTML and then we can make

00:41:35,079 --> 00:41:40,809
responsive prototypes and then we can

00:41:38,109 --> 00:41:46,599
better manage the expectations from the

00:41:40,809 --> 00:41:49,420
start about how the look and behavior on

00:41:46,599 --> 00:41:53,349
all different kinds of devices if we're

00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:56,440
working in HTML it's shared and updated

00:41:53,349 --> 00:41:58,270
easily we provide some URL put a

00:41:56,440 --> 00:42:00,670
password in front of it if you want and

00:41:58,270 --> 00:42:03,789
people can use it from their own device

00:42:00,670 --> 00:42:06,119
and I go it works and that creates

00:42:03,789 --> 00:42:11,109
buy-in and it creates enthusiasts

00:42:06,119 --> 00:42:14,380
enthusiasm and buy-in is always good to

00:42:11,109 --> 00:42:16,420
have so people get at users there

00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:20,319
because they can use it on your own

00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:22,359
device kind of works already great what

00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:24,250
I also find with prototyping is that you

00:42:22,359 --> 00:42:26,920
can't get away with lorem ipsum or

00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:28,620
filler text as easily as you can in

00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:31,600
static wireframes

00:42:28,620 --> 00:42:34,600
because we're trying to get a grip on

00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:36,850
the flow we have to provide actual

00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:40,690
contents put the right words on the

00:42:36,850 --> 00:42:43,300
labels of the buttons etc so it makes

00:42:40,690 --> 00:42:46,600
content earlier part of the process it's

00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:50,290
a nice way of working to get both the

00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:52,270
designer and the copywriter and the

00:42:50,290 --> 00:42:55,000
developer together around a single

00:42:52,270 --> 00:42:58,180
deliverable basically again shared

00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:00,160
understanding is a good thing because it

00:42:58,180 --> 00:43:07,510
works because it's clickable we can test

00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:10,660
it with the audience I use yeah a

00:43:07,510 --> 00:43:12,820
prototype it's some quote a prototype is

00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:16,810
worth a thousand meetings in that sense

00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:21,550
that just feeling it work takes away a

00:43:16,810 --> 00:43:24,330
lot of the yes but and doubts people

00:43:21,550 --> 00:43:33,070
might have or I think they should have

00:43:24,330 --> 00:43:35,370
just to have a voice in this okay to

00:43:33,070 --> 00:43:35,370
recap

00:43:41,210 --> 00:43:47,930
ask the simple and hard questions when

00:43:45,650 --> 00:43:51,350
you're starting an engagement with the

00:43:47,930 --> 00:43:54,170
client be very specific about that you

00:43:51,350 --> 00:43:56,180
want to know why we're doing this for

00:43:54,170 --> 00:44:00,230
whom are we doing this and what are we

00:43:56,180 --> 00:44:04,970
trying to make are we are we be are we

00:44:00,230 --> 00:44:07,580
being innovative here are we optimizing

00:44:04,970 --> 00:44:09,830
existing stuff all those examples why

00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:12,560
are due why are we doing this what is

00:44:09,830 --> 00:44:16,610
the opportunity what do you really want

00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:19,220
is to make for you and then it's up to

00:44:16,610 --> 00:44:21,080
us as designers and developers to get

00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:25,820
the best possible answer to that

00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:27,650
question ideally you get involved with

00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:29,240
divining the roadmap that could even be

00:44:27,650 --> 00:44:32,810
from the technical perspective right

00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:35,860
just being able to help define how many

00:44:32,810 --> 00:44:40,150
dollar are your signs should be on those

00:44:35,860 --> 00:44:43,040
subprojects can help prioritize things

00:44:40,150 --> 00:44:45,170
because you know you can make a rough

00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:51,400
assumption about how much work it will

00:44:45,170 --> 00:44:51,400
be to create our do that fix or new idea

00:44:52,870 --> 00:45:01,670
know where you are in the process so

00:44:56,530 --> 00:45:04,130
consider this flow if somebody comes to

00:45:01,670 --> 00:45:06,260
you and say yeah go cool go design this

00:45:04,130 --> 00:45:08,900
here's a couple of wireframes and you

00:45:06,260 --> 00:45:11,330
can use this basically I should check

00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:16,060
list to see if you if everything is in

00:45:11,330 --> 00:45:16,060
place from the steps before it

00:45:18,580 --> 00:45:26,080
so too many words on the single slide

00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:30,550
but if we're if you're asked to do the

00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:32,290
design then you should double check if

00:45:30,550 --> 00:45:34,780
the why under what answers are in place

00:45:32,290 --> 00:45:36,490
of course you don't have to do

00:45:34,780 --> 00:45:38,860
everything all the time for every

00:45:36,490 --> 00:45:40,540
project you do a quick scan and you see

00:45:38,860 --> 00:45:43,960
that all these clients knows where these

00:45:40,540 --> 00:45:45,880
up to with the strategy but emailing

00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:47,650
some help with getting to learn these

00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:51,070
customers they have actually on the

00:45:47,650 --> 00:45:52,720
concept makes sense but maybe the

00:45:51,070 --> 00:45:56,530
content strategy needs some work so you

00:45:52,720 --> 00:46:03,850
do it you specify and customize this for

00:45:56,530 --> 00:46:05,980
each engagement at the very least try to

00:46:03,850 --> 00:46:08,260
formulate it that project we've players

00:46:05,980 --> 00:46:10,210
even for yourself because it often seems

00:46:08,260 --> 00:46:12,610
that this whole design phase is over and

00:46:10,210 --> 00:46:17,770
done maybe so here's the stuff go build

00:46:12,610 --> 00:46:20,410
it that's usually not true because when

00:46:17,770 --> 00:46:23,470
you start building it problems will

00:46:20,410 --> 00:46:26,800
surface so insist on creating that short

00:46:23,470 --> 00:46:29,410
form project beef it's valuable input

00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:32,470
for prioritizing the stories in your bag

00:46:29,410 --> 00:46:34,750
law but also because it's very likely

00:46:32,470 --> 00:46:37,570
design is not yet done all these

00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:39,910
unknowns whole surface and you can then

00:46:37,570 --> 00:46:41,740
refer back to this briefing and help the

00:46:39,910 --> 00:46:44,160
clients and yourself make the right

00:46:41,740 --> 00:46:44,160
trade-offs

00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:55,790
so that's basically what I had for you

00:46:51,170 --> 00:46:59,720
today I hope that just getting this big

00:46:55,790 --> 00:47:01,940
picture maybe helps you frame or

00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:03,910
understand what you're seeing and

00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:08,140
hearing and learning in follow-up

00:47:03,910 --> 00:47:08,140
sessions in the content strategy track

00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:26,650
thank you very much if there's questions

00:47:20,450 --> 00:47:26,650
I'll take them yes

00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:43,420
I'm being accused of waterfall yeah so

00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:46,000
another way to think about this the

00:47:43,420 --> 00:47:56,460
first half is what in agile is called

00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:59,109
spring zero maybe and you need that and

00:47:56,460 --> 00:48:01,599
yeah you need that preparation work done

00:47:59,109 --> 00:48:05,109
and you can be as heavy as lightweight

00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:07,329
as the project requires but it really

00:48:05,109 --> 00:48:09,099
really does make sense to get not the

00:48:07,329 --> 00:48:11,529
big design up front but a big idea up

00:48:09,099 --> 00:48:13,269
front right and that's what that

00:48:11,529 --> 00:48:15,309
discover and definition phase should do

00:48:13,269 --> 00:48:21,760
for you because you want to end up with

00:48:15,309 --> 00:48:24,430
a backlog that makes sense and feel free

00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:32,890
to sprint iterate through building the

00:48:24,430 --> 00:48:36,400
solution but oh even of course you have

00:48:32,890 --> 00:48:40,319
to revisit the actual idea again as well

00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:43,710
once every x amount of time and that

00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:46,089
depends on the size of the project and

00:48:43,710 --> 00:48:48,180
the life cycle of the project of course

00:48:46,089 --> 00:48:53,430
how much that needs to be done but yes

00:48:48,180 --> 00:48:53,430
you have to revisit your assumptions and

00:48:54,329 --> 00:49:01,539
yeah you have to revisit the assumptions

00:48:56,559 --> 00:49:03,970
in the plan as well but yes um I kind of

00:49:01,539 --> 00:49:06,279
still assume that time is a linear thing

00:49:03,970 --> 00:49:10,650
so we need to do that thing first and

00:49:06,279 --> 00:49:10,650
then we can work through it

00:49:13,829 --> 00:49:15,890
you

00:49:19,269 --> 00:49:24,470
thanks again

00:49:21,290 --> 00:49:30,400
come to the Sprint's talk all the UX and

00:49:24,470 --> 00:49:30,400
design stuff there a Miss question yes

00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:14,050
so you're saying in the yeah so in this

00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:17,510
first discovery phase way we ask why

00:50:14,050 --> 00:50:20,480
that we have to create a picture or

00:50:17,510 --> 00:50:24,050
knowledge about the customer you are

00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:26,150
asking how do we make sure our validate

00:50:24,050 --> 00:50:34,660
that what we think we know about the

00:50:26,150 --> 00:50:37,280
customer is the right thing yes yeah so

00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:39,350
one of the things is that even in a

00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:42,860
definition phase where we create the

00:50:39,350 --> 00:50:46,690
concepts like the outline of the answer

00:50:42,860 --> 00:50:48,830
that we're going to build in the in yeah

00:50:46,690 --> 00:50:50,600
the outline of the answer that we're

00:50:48,830 --> 00:50:52,760
from for for the question that we're

00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:55,640
seeing even there you can do high-level

00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:57,890
prototyping and get feedback from your

00:50:55,640 --> 00:51:02,330
users again there's many ways but it

00:50:57,890 --> 00:51:09,830
falls down to testing your idea with the

00:51:02,330 --> 00:51:12,470
audience once again yes yeah you want

00:51:09,830 --> 00:51:14,750
you want yeah you well it depends on

00:51:12,470 --> 00:51:17,870
again how many time yeah how much time

00:51:14,750 --> 00:51:19,910
you have and how much cycles you

00:51:17,870 --> 00:51:22,580
basically have our sprint super to work

00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:25,450
through but yeah you should validate as

00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:25,450
soon as possible

00:51:31,430 --> 00:51:40,920
yes computer Sprint's do all the Iraq

00:51:35,610 --> 00:51:42,660
see things and I'm curious for your

00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:45,090
feedback so i put in the what did you

00:51:42,660 --> 00:51:49,640
think slide as well and give me your

00:51:45,090 --> 00:51:49,640
