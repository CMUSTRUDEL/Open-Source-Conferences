Publication date: 2015-09-22
Playlist: DrupalCon Barcelona - September 2015
Description: 
	Of course, design is more about putting on the nice colors and fonts.
But then, what *do* you need to design for impact?

We'll look at the Double Diamond as a handy format for capturing all the activities and prerequisites for design that serves user needs *and* supports your clients strategic objectives.

With the context of this framework we'll then look at the specific activities and deliverables that help the transition and collaboration from design to development:

- Getting a shared understanding of the project goal
- The value of content modelling
- Prototyping & usability testing
