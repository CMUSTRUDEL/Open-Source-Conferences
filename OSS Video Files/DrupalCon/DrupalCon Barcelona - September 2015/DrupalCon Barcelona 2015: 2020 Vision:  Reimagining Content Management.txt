Title: DrupalCon Barcelona 2015: 2020 Vision:  Reimagining Content Management
Publication date: 2015-09-22
Playlist: DrupalCon Barcelona - September 2015
Description: 
	You’ve probably been through a site redesign before, so you know the inherent challenges and how it exposes content structure problems, outdated content, and content that’s simply no longer relevant to your current users. You go through the painstaking process of working with your internal IT staff or an external vendor to map your existing content to the new structure that is targeted to your new audience. Problem is, this change is only for the new structure, and will have to be done again. There has to be a better way.

What if there was an approach to monitoring and auditing your content at strategic points throughout the year to effectively flag changes in your user’s behavior so that you can position content more appropriately? This important, ongoing process shouldn’t be as arduous as a full content migration, and may just be something you actually like to do.

In this talk we will unpack the strategy—not a technical solution—behind this thinking, and how the right kind of planning can help you make the right strategic decisions and understand the true scope and value of what you’re taking on.  Things like:

Content Strategy
Auditing (much of which are not solved with technology)
Help verify proper tools to provide actionable data
Audience, traffic behavior, and target metrics
Publishing volume and throughput (how much, how often)
Governance rules you can live with
How to apply the data, and what to impact
How this impacts marketing (positioning, social strategy, customer funnel, etc.)
Whether you have ample funding, or just received an unfunded mandate, the first steps are understanding your content lifecycle, and then set up a renewable process to ensure you’re targeting your audience correctly and staying current on a regular basis.

good afternoon making sure everyone is

00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:08,160
in the right session I know it's the end

00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:10,800
of the day it's been a long day it's

00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:13,830
been a fun day I promise we'll get out a

00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:20,609
little bit early that's my pledge to you

00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:23,279
today so that's if I could learn to

00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:25,680
operate my own computer I'm can record

00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:28,019
you might know me as agent record my

00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,840
name is actually down on the floor in

00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:33,570
the exhibit hall I'm really tiny right

00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:36,149
under checks is really big c HX I'm

00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:38,399
right underneath him like this this big

00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:40,350
letters I've been around for a very very

00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,820
long time in the Drupal community I'm

00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:44,969
right now the director of professional

00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:46,410
services at palantir net which means i'm

00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:48,530
in charge of account management and

00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:50,879
sales and training and some other things

00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:54,449
I've been a drupal contributors in

00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:56,640
struggle for dot 5 which is semi

00:00:54,449 --> 00:00:59,520
impressive was one of the co-authors of

00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,680
Drupal 7 module development one of my

00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,719
co-authors is speaking about this same

00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:06,240
topic to the developers in the core

00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:09,210
conversations track right now which is

00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:11,010
kind of amusing and I was a top 50

00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:13,590
contributor in Drupal 7 then I got

00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:15,570
promoted to management and on top of 150

00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:17,220
contributor to Drupal 8 because I

00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:20,880
haven't written code as my day job in

00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:22,140
about three years before that and we'll

00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:25,020
talk about this because I had fun

00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:27,420
putting this together I spent before i

00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:30,060
got into Drupal or when I first got into

00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:32,400
Drupal i should say i was working for a

00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:34,560
newspaper company and we'll talk a

00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,710
little bit about that when i get into

00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:41,040
some some history so we're going to talk

00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:42,780
today about four basic things again i'm

00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,600
going to set some terms so that we all

00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:46,649
can agree on what we're talking about

00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:48,750
i'm going to talk a little bit about

00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:52,619
history of content management very

00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:54,450
briefly we're going to talk about some

00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:57,659
needs going forward and we're going to

00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:59,040
set some goals in particular again how

00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:03,689
many people in this room would consider

00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:06,960
themselves to be developers that's about

00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:08,160
what I expected I will tell you this

00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,410
like I said I've been doing this a long

00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:12,750
time the first talk I ever gave was if

00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:13,650
the Florida Press Association is a

00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:15,750
newspaper

00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:18,360
difference and I had a room like this

00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:20,849
and half the room were or managers or

00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:23,040
editors the other half were developers

00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:25,939
and no one considered themselves to be

00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:31,950
both and so bridging that gap between

00:02:25,939 --> 00:02:33,900
the tools that editors need and the ways

00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:35,879
that developers think about them is

00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,930
critically important that's really what

00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:40,560
we're going to be getting into here

00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:43,260
today so these concepts should be

00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:46,049
familiar to your development teams and

00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:47,430
if they're not well if they are familiar

00:02:46,049 --> 00:02:49,409
they will think of them in in this

00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:52,319
language that we're talking about so I

00:02:49,409 --> 00:02:55,739
think it's it's very important so we'll

00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:58,769
start with the terms very simple what is

00:02:55,739 --> 00:03:00,840
a CMS content management system two

00:02:58,769 --> 00:03:04,650
words there I want to focus on a course

00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:06,450
management and a system the biggest

00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:08,609
thing between you know about a content

00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:12,959
management system is that it requires

00:03:08,609 --> 00:03:16,500
structure it requires consistency right

00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:18,150
that's a big deal I want to contrast

00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:20,730
that to what most people are familiar

00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:23,549
with which is actually a web publishing

00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:25,379
tool the web publishing tool is actually

00:03:23,549 --> 00:03:28,680
just a thing designed to get things onto

00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:31,230
the internet web publishing tools do not

00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:34,019
like structure web publishing tools

00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:35,579
don't care about governance or the rules

00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:38,669
that one applies for editing and

00:03:35,579 --> 00:03:41,459
publishing I'll give you a very simple

00:03:38,669 --> 00:03:44,370
example how many of you use wysiwyg

00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:45,659
editors like ck editor you know those

00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:47,579
things that look like Microsoft Word

00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:50,159
yeah those are web publishing tools

00:03:47,579 --> 00:03:52,680
they're not content management tools

00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:55,220
those are tools designed to help things

00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:57,690
look the way you think they should look

00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:59,159
but that's not necessarily the same

00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:00,930
thing as having a content management

00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:04,379
system or a content management strategy

00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:06,209
or lo and behold a design strategy to

00:04:04,379 --> 00:04:08,159
inform the way your pages are rendered

00:04:06,209 --> 00:04:10,040
and I want to get into that so the

00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:13,560
difference between these two things a

00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:15,329
web publishing tool generally was

00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:19,169
created by people who grew up in the

00:04:15,329 --> 00:04:20,669
print world how many of you had

00:04:19,169 --> 00:04:24,270
experience like this I used to build

00:04:20,669 --> 00:04:26,660
websites a long time ago lovely lovely

00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:32,780
design come in from a print designer

00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:36,080
and she had designed it vertically so it

00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:38,600
was longer than it was tall and I had to

00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:41,480
have a very polite conversation that she

00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:45,230
really had you know 600 pixels this way

00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:46,550
and 300 pixels this way that she

00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:49,390
converted it took her two days it was

00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:51,500
great it's beautiful but the print model

00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:54,800
infiltrates our thinking you know in a

00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:56,870
lot of ways print tools are layout

00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:59,600
focused right they're all about

00:04:56,870 --> 00:05:02,120
proportion where does this fit compared

00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:05,930
to that and again with a from a web

00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:09,290
publishing model editors and designers

00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:10,550
really value uniqueness in their layout

00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:12,290
they want to be able to do something

00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:14,510
that's different they want to be able to

00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:15,710
do something that's stunning it's one of

00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:17,690
the things that keeps magazines in

00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:19,700
business is that magazines can give you

00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:22,780
that good visual and web publishing

00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:26,810
tools tend to be these page centric

00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:28,880
visually oriented things we'll talk a

00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:31,400
little bit about that as we go whereas a

00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:34,880
CMS is very very different it's driven

00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:36,950
by the online models of how we produce

00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:39,470
and consume information and in

00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:44,210
particular of its focused on content and

00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:45,410
on distribution right if you i should

00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:48,140
say I've been doing this professionally

00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:51,950
since 1998 and I first learned how to do

00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:53,690
web pages in 1995 the original web pages

00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:56,690
remembered all that gray background and

00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:59,510
blue links and black text right there

00:05:56,690 --> 00:06:01,280
were no dot design considerations right

00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:03,500
that's not what the web was invented for

00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:06,020
the web was invented to be a very very

00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:10,850
convenient and efficient way to share

00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:12,500
data right so the two models are very

00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:14,780
very different they come at the same

00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:17,210
basic problem space from a very

00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:18,770
different approach so this is going to

00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:22,580
sort of ground what we're talking about

00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:24,380
as we go so talk a little history I said

00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:27,800
I've been doing this since since 1995

00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:30,650
does anyone remember this this is how I

00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:33,550
learned to write web pages Netscape

00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:38,510
Navigator gold came out in 95 I believe

00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:41,220
it came with a page editor

00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:43,230
you could build web pages with this um

00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:46,440
that actually learned to code because it

00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:49,220
wrote really really bad web pages I mean

00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:52,230
if the the actual output it produced was

00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:54,150
it was bad you couldn't quite make it do

00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:58,620
what you wanted it to do see you so I

00:06:54,150 --> 00:07:00,840
learned to edit these pages but it I say

00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:02,370
page centric layout centric that's what

00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:05,070
it was designed to do I mean it looks

00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:07,740
like Microsoft Word and it did that by

00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:09,600
on purpose and for those of you who

00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:11,790
don't know this tool by the way imagine

00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:13,620
if you could open your browser and there

00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:16,080
was another tab in your browser to let

00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:19,290
you edit the page that's what Netscape

00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:22,140
Navigator gold did you just pop open I

00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:23,940
want to edit this and this how we all

00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:25,770
learned how to build web pages is great

00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:28,410
and you got to build things like this

00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:33,690
with it this is from an archive of geo

00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:36,570
cities right yeah that that inverted el

00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:38,340
very familiar with that pattern and this

00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:40,020
is also famous because the Space Jam

00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:42,900
website is still live on the Internet

00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:45,300
you can still go look at it right but

00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:47,850
these are again design centric most of

00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:50,430
the in the things we were building in 95

00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:54,840
and 96 they were either generally plain

00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:56,970
text or image heavy with no real

00:07:54,840 --> 00:08:01,170
information on them right this is sort

00:07:56,970 --> 00:08:05,430
of a classic example of peak web design

00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:06,900
from 1997 it's great at the time I was

00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:08,790
working for a newspaper company i

00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:12,870
mentioned called morris digital works

00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:14,250
and I was used to this page model and so

00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:16,530
I've been constructing things using

00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:20,820
these visual editors and looking at them

00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:24,030
and at the newspaper what we were trying

00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:26,300
to do was turn out hundred it the bigger

00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:29,700
properties about a hundred stories a day

00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:34,620
you can't handcraft a hundred stories a

00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:36,330
day as an editor you know you can't you

00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:37,620
just can't you need some kind of

00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:39,750
automation you need some kind of tool

00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:42,810
for it and it made me very sad I

00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:45,210
couldn't find a good picture but this

00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:48,630
was our editing tool it was actually a

00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:50,690
filemaker pro database I'll get wistful

00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:54,150
about filemaker pro

00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:55,650
beautiful piece of software and what it

00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:57,720
would do is it would take our newspaper

00:08:55,650 --> 00:09:01,640
content we would we would rip it into

00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:04,620
the system and it would then use

00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:06,090
semantics right to show us what the

00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:08,390
different parts are there's a headline

00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:12,510
there's a subhead there's the body copy

00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:16,290
and at this point there's no markup in

00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:18,000
here this is all pure data it's great it

00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:20,010
actually then had its own template in

00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,830
engine and on output it would literally

00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:27,800
spit out all your HTML but at its core

00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:29,580
it was a database for proofreading the

00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:31,470
content you were getting from print

00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:34,050
right and what was really funny about

00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:36,150
this for us at the Digital side is that

00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:38,970
our print editors because they wanted

00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:41,190
pages to look nice would often break the

00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:42,600
conventions for how to build a page so

00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:44,760
when we pulled the content over there'd

00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:47,400
be no headline because they weren't

00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:49,230
using the right font styles to map to

00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:51,330
headlines because they wanted to do

00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:54,120
something unique so we had a lot of fun

00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:57,500
with that but this is fascinating to me

00:09:54,120 --> 00:10:01,200
because this I mean they did this in in

00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:05,940
1996 is when it first came out and the

00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:13,290
HTML it spit out had embedded semantic

00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:14,580
tagging in it right does anyone does

00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:22,500
anyone want to ask a question about why

00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:24,390
I think that's a big deal why sorry yeah

00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:26,339
people talk about semantic tagging is

00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:28,980
now huge that's right it's the thing but

00:10:26,339 --> 00:10:32,490
this is almost 20 years ago right and

00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:34,140
and the software engineers who built the

00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:36,150
system were like you know we might want

00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:38,070
to scrape this data off this web page

00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:41,400
later and republish it in a different

00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:43,920
form we we should probably make it so

00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:46,410
that we can do that but it's it's the

00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:48,120
really really funny piece here it's

00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:50,220
actually not semantic markup what they

00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:53,880
were doing was embedding their hidden

00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:56,630
stuff in HTML comments and then we were

00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:59,730
actually using like font tags for layout

00:10:56,630 --> 00:11:01,450
so it was sort of a mash of the two it's

00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:04,520
really kind of fascinated

00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:07,089
around the same time so I'm working for

00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:13,970
this company i'm using this tool from

00:11:07,089 --> 00:11:17,480
1999 through 2007 dropped or drupal

00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:19,399
comes out 2001 right so while i'm

00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:21,500
working in this space where again we're

00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:24,560
using FileMaker which is a database

00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:27,380
application to generate web pages so

00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:30,740
that we can harvest our data and do

00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:33,050
useful things with it drupal.org comes

00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:36,589
out or drupal comes out this is a

00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:38,060
screenshot from Drupal 3 I have a whole

00:11:36,589 --> 00:11:42,410
other presentation about that it's a lot

00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:48,350
of fun very very different way of

00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:51,680
thinking about your content right so

00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:55,370
that's interesting I didn't know I had a

00:11:51,680 --> 00:12:00,110
transition in my slide there's a boom

00:11:55,370 --> 00:12:05,000
actually in the early 2000s websites

00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:07,779
like corrosion which is now gone and oh

00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,440
now slashdot was the other one right

00:12:07,779 --> 00:12:12,709
drupal for those of you don't know

00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:14,450
started as a slash slash dot club right

00:12:12,709 --> 00:12:17,779
I want to be able to spit out news

00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:19,329
quickly right and so we have a bunch of

00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:22,459
tools that come out around the same time

00:12:19,329 --> 00:12:25,579
and they all it's interesting because

00:12:22,459 --> 00:12:28,040
the shift there is to thinking away from

00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:30,260
pages and towards these bite-sized

00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:32,209
chunks of data what's your title what's

00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:34,240
your headline what's your what's your

00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:36,589
body copy and trying to keep separate

00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:40,100
the structure of your content from the

00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:42,050
display of your content so we'll go to

00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:45,760
the semantic markup issue have we made

00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:47,779
any actual progress in the last 15 years

00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:49,760
certainly we have we have much better

00:12:47,779 --> 00:12:51,380
tools I'm one of those people who

00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:57,230
started web development before there was

00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:59,839
CSS yeah we have html5 which has some

00:12:57,230 --> 00:13:01,579
really really great components to it we

00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:03,770
have semantic markup that semantic

00:13:01,579 --> 00:13:06,410
markup again instead of having to

00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:09,350
separate the tags that tell me what my

00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:11,270
data is HTML now supports that so we can

00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:13,200
very clearly say this is the article

00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:16,170
this is the headline

00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:17,610
this is headline one headline two etc we

00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:19,860
have data-driven layouts which are

00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:21,540
really really important we're

00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:23,010
microformats we have frameworks we have

00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:25,310
lots of different ways to distribute

00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:28,290
information to think about information

00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:30,900
and yet I think we still have this open

00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:33,390
question are you using a CMS or are you

00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:36,300
using a web publishing tool and i love

00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:38,970
these examples here I don't know how big

00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:42,090
medium is in Europe folks read medium

00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:43,560
over here I'll show you a screenshot

00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:45,990
it's like medium is essentially a

00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:48,210
blogging platform and then it aggregates

00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:49,590
content it's really nice authors love it

00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:53,100
it's very easy to use and their pages

00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:55,200
are beautiful but their code is not so

00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:57,300
we're talking about like a web

00:13:55,200 --> 00:14:01,940
publishing tool Dreamweaver front page

00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:04,050
these are web publishing tools WordPress

00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:07,320
started its life as a web publishing

00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:09,540
tool right one of the great you folks

00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:11,370
seen all the Drupal 8 new stuff like one

00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:14,750
of the great features of Drupal 8 is it

00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:17,280
finally has a WYSIWYG editor in core

00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:18,990
because the people who build Drupal have

00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:20,400
been fighting against it forever because

00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:22,770
the people who build Drupal want to

00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:25,890
build a CMS and they think WYSIWYG

00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:28,110
editors are web publishing tools right

00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:31,620
so there's this idea once you introduce

00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:34,230
that once you let people you know put

00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:39,090
mark up into their body copy using a

00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:43,500
WYSIWYG you've broken that the data

00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:44,970
model right so you know whether

00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:47,280
WordPress or medium or things like that

00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:49,860
are CMS's or w pts and again this is

00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:54,590
what medium looks like really really

00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:58,350
nice there HTML is absolutely horrible

00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:59,970
and not semantics at all right they

00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:02,010
don't care about that that's not their

00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:03,840
business model alright their business

00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:09,840
model is how do I make it easier for

00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:11,340
people to build pretty web pages now the

00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:13,020
reason I think this is interesting is

00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:14,250
the web has also changed pretty

00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:16,620
drastically I mean this is a screenshot

00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:19,560
of my Twitter feed right Twitter cares

00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:21,770
quite a great deal about semantic data

00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:24,180
and Twitter doesn't care at all about

00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:26,180
markup I mean you don't put mark up into

00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:28,630
Twitter feeds twitter has

00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:31,370
things like standards for web publishers

00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:33,320
to put semantic data in the header of a

00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:36,470
web page so that Twitter can generate

00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:39,020
those images right you're supposed to

00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:40,250
tell twitter how to read your stuff and

00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:42,589
i think that's kind of fascinating and

00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:46,630
you could actually look at the HTML it

00:15:42,589 --> 00:15:51,950
spits out is a little bit better in

00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:54,050
terms of the semantic structure to it at

00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:56,540
least their div classes have actual

00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:58,700
meaning to them right is it a preview is

00:15:56,540 --> 00:16:01,070
it not but I mean there's some

00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:03,290
interesting things happening in the web

00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:04,850
space one of Google's new missions in

00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:07,540
life is to make sure you never have to

00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:09,649
visit another webpage other than Google

00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:11,660
right oh I want to know about the

00:16:09,649 --> 00:16:14,570
cigarette of familia okay oh here's

00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:15,620
everything I need to know by the way the

00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:16,970
other thing he needs to know about the

00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:19,670
Sagrada Familia is you should book

00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:21,649
online you should book in advance it was

00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:27,080
a five hour wait yesterday so we didn't

00:16:21,649 --> 00:16:29,420
go we're going thursday so i'm going to

00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:31,430
make the argument that the web page is a

00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:33,320
dead thing it is not something that we

00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:35,260
should be thinking about and if you are

00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:37,970
talking to people in your organization

00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:41,270
who are thinking about the design of a

00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:43,760
page or the layout of a page that they

00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:47,330
are thinking in terms that are outdated

00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:48,440
and inappropriate in particular if

00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:52,400
you're dealing with people who are

00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:53,959
trying to sell you software right the

00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:56,300
great example i have for this is at

00:16:53,959 --> 00:17:00,410
palantir we don't design in photoshop

00:16:56,300 --> 00:17:02,930
anymore we design in HTML chunks and

00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:06,500
show those chunks to people we do design

00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:07,760
systems not here's a pretty page here's

00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:11,360
a pretty picture of what your website

00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:13,130
looks like now your website is a cluster

00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:15,230
of components that interact with one

00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:17,540
another it's a very different model for

00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:19,790
looking at things so we have these

00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:21,290
things I do a talk frequently where I

00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:23,270
joke that the next big thing is going to

00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:25,400
be the internet on the tops of your

00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:26,420
shoes right so you don't have to look

00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:29,840
people in the face when you're walking

00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:31,790
Oh news on my shoe the only way to get

00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:35,330
news on your shoe is through structured

00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:37,070
data right you can't get a web page on

00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:39,480
to the Apple watch you can send data to

00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:43,230
it and it can have a data reader

00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:46,429
right and then the device will then

00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:48,870
display that data appropriately okay

00:17:46,429 --> 00:17:50,790
things that can do that things that can

00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:52,980
power that are content management

00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:55,530
systems because again they're thinking

00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:58,650
about data in a structured and reusable

00:17:55,530 --> 00:18:00,630
way right so since we have with this

00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:03,750
sort of plural proliferation of devices

00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:07,559
we have watches and things and we have

00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:10,140
to design for those different viewpoints

00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:14,130
we have to design so that our data

00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:16,679
always matters right and you get a

00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:18,900
consistent experience across devices so

00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:22,980
this is the big change and just to drive

00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:25,980
at home I love this in 2014 yeah mobile

00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:28,200
finally outstripped desktop and

00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:31,530
particularly particularly if you get out

00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:33,299
of the United States or Europe this is

00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:38,280
true if you go to Africa it's all mobile

00:18:33,299 --> 00:18:40,470
all mobile internet there you know there

00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:43,010
just aren't people sitting around using

00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:47,460
computers the way that we're used to

00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:50,340
this is the future and in order to power

00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:54,090
that you have to think about what you're

00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:56,669
trying to transmit so that's where we

00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:59,000
get into these these needs pardon me one

00:18:56,669 --> 00:18:59,000
second

00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:10,149
so I'm going to steal an acronym and

00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:12,039
I'll show you a chart this is actually

00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:15,360
from National Public Radio National

00:19:12,039 --> 00:19:18,220
Public Radio in the United States is

00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:20,350
government and community supported news

00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:22,570
and information it's actually some of

00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:25,779
the best radio we have and they coined

00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:29,039
this this acronym cope right create once

00:19:25,779 --> 00:19:32,789
published everywhere this idea that as a

00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:36,240
Content producer you should be able to

00:19:32,789 --> 00:19:38,499
write your story you should be able to

00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:40,809
control your data in such a way that

00:19:38,499 --> 00:19:42,759
once it's there it can go wherever it

00:19:40,809 --> 00:19:45,639
needs to and that can be distributed

00:19:42,759 --> 00:19:47,619
well I was showing you cite Weaver the

00:19:45,639 --> 00:19:50,200
tool we use when I was newspaper and at

00:19:47,619 --> 00:19:52,299
one point we we wrote a plugin for site

00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:54,460
Weaver that would send some of our data

00:19:52,299 --> 00:19:57,249
to MSNBC so they could publish our

00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:58,570
headlines and link back to us and we

00:19:57,249 --> 00:20:01,289
sent them like this little sliver of

00:19:58,570 --> 00:20:06,460
metadata it was very very cutting edge

00:20:01,289 --> 00:20:08,679
and a total failure so but this is like

00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:11,649
the original graph of the cope model

00:20:08,679 --> 00:20:14,289
from 2009 what they're actually trying

00:20:11,649 --> 00:20:16,690
to do right where you have the sort of

00:20:14,289 --> 00:20:19,929
data entry those those editors are on

00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:23,830
the far left and actually lord knows

00:20:19,929 --> 00:20:25,149
what on the far right right Larry

00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:26,529
Garfield is one of our engineers give a

00:20:25,149 --> 00:20:27,879
talk this morning where he was talking

00:20:26,529 --> 00:20:30,610
about symphony and some of the things

00:20:27,879 --> 00:20:34,619
that it can do we did a project two

00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:37,119
years ago for an Australian telecom firm

00:20:34,619 --> 00:20:40,809
we essentially built them a video

00:20:37,119 --> 00:20:44,230
on-demand platform but we only built the

00:20:40,809 --> 00:20:46,570
middle part right we have no idea what

00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:49,990
they actually built for inner for users

00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:53,379
we just built an editorial tool and an

00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:55,480
API layer right we both to create once

00:20:53,379 --> 00:20:57,580
part and then they dealt with the

00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:59,679
publish stuff right I'm pretty sure they

00:20:57,580 --> 00:21:00,759
built a set-top box application I'm

00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:02,460
pretty sure they built a mobile

00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:06,369
application i know they built a website

00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:08,320
right but that didn't affect any of the

00:21:06,369 --> 00:21:11,230
data entry stuff right because the data

00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:14,080
entry can't be tied to the presentation

00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:15,879
layer right if you again if your data is

00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:18,900
tied to your presentation you're dealing

00:21:15,879 --> 00:21:24,490
with a web publishing tool

00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:25,300
so some needs and definitions again

00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:26,830
these are the things you should be

00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:29,980
talking about with your developers and

00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:33,820
or your vendors right but CMS means

00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:36,570
separate concerns always your content is

00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:39,850
not the display of that content right

00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:42,010
your management is not the same thing as

00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:43,510
your publication and I will give you an

00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:47,170
example there's a great talk that was

00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:51,310
given today about putting crap in Drupal

00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:55,710
core crap meaning create read archive

00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:59,650
and publish it was a metaphor for the

00:21:55,710 --> 00:22:02,440
workflow / if they're going with

00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:05,950
purchase at a crap now I thought they

00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:08,710
were still talk all in a crap in the

00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:10,570
program it was called I'll purged not

00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:13,960
published / time sorry create read

00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:19,570
archive purge I'm terribly sorry I have

00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:21,940
my acronyms backwards the idea being

00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:24,520
that the act of archiving old

00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:27,130
information is in fact a management act

00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:28,060
act it's not a publication act you know

00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:30,340
those things that we talked about

00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:32,950
earlier as web publishing tools front

00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:35,680
page has no concept of archiving right

00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:38,590
Photoshop certainly has no concept of an

00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:43,810
archive or of purging old data from your

00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:45,850
database so giving you a help helpful

00:22:43,810 --> 00:22:48,130
hint by the way this is the quiz portion

00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:52,330
right what do you need you know for

00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:56,850
content in 2015 5 things guess which one

00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:59,710
is most important it's the yellow one oh

00:22:56,850 --> 00:23:02,710
yeah you need architecture right you

00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:04,330
need a Content architecture Drupal is

00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:06,100
really good at that we'll talk a little

00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:08,590
bit about that WordPress is getting much

00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:10,120
better at this medium is actually pretty

00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:12,100
good at this let's be clear I mean even

00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:15,520
twitter has an architecture it's a very

00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:18,280
simple architecture you put in 140

00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:21,940
characters boom governance how many of

00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:24,190
you know what governance is talk about I

00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:26,830
I talked to someone today who was in

00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:29,230
sales and he said if they understand

00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:32,090
governance then we're in

00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:35,630
governance are the rules and procedures

00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:38,570
around who can publish what and when and

00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:41,440
how they're reviewed and etc etc so I'll

00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:43,970
give you a simple example here in

00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:46,070
Catalunya it is important that

00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:49,010
everything be available in both Catalan

00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:50,990
and Spanish and so you might have an

00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:53,960
editor whose sole job is to make sure

00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:55,940
that both both versions are ready for

00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:57,410
publication right in countries like

00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:59,570
Switzerland where they have three and

00:23:57,410 --> 00:24:01,460
four national languages this is

00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:03,260
crucially important right so you might

00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:06,110
have a governance rule that says this

00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:07,820
content cannot go live until all of the

00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:12,770
translation editors have signed off on

00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:14,929
it right so governance I I will say this

00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:17,360
later in the talk probably because I say

00:24:14,929 --> 00:24:19,190
it all the time almost everyone in this

00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:22,660
room does not actually have a technology

00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:25,330
problem you have a governance problem

00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:28,640
right technology is actually a commodity

00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:30,230
you know wordpress drupal you could

00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:32,510
probably solve most of your business

00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:34,370
needs using something like medium right

00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:36,260
it's perfectly fine hector businesses

00:24:34,370 --> 00:24:39,620
who do all of their stuff on facebook

00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:41,780
right it's fine until you start having

00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:44,660
complex governance needs then it it's

00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:46,780
not so good you need storage right

00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:51,500
storage is absolutely critical

00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:53,090
especially in the digital medium again I

00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:55,910
came out of a newsroom whenever we start

00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:57,530
a new project I always like to ask two

00:24:55,910 --> 00:24:59,809
questions that get to the fundamental

00:24:57,530 --> 00:25:02,150
sort of heart of everything question one

00:24:59,809 --> 00:25:04,309
is where it is first right through

00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:05,990
happen which simply means when you're

00:25:04,309 --> 00:25:08,390
creating new content for your sites

00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:11,000
where do you write it do you first

00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:12,590
scroll it on a napkin do you write it in

00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,210
Microsoft Word and then paste it over

00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:15,890
into your content management system or

00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:18,830
you actually use your content management

00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:23,900
system as your editorial system which is

00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:26,179
preferable obviously so that's question

00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:30,740
one question two is where's your

00:25:26,179 --> 00:25:33,410
database of record right where are you

00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:35,299
actually storing your historical value

00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:37,340
site Weaver was great but it was

00:25:35,299 --> 00:25:39,950
considered a temporary solution and

00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:41,789
literally I used to work with a bunch of

00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:45,399
people who worked at

00:25:41,789 --> 00:25:48,610
they worked at a nuclear bomb facility

00:25:45,399 --> 00:25:51,429
believe it or not very near our offices

00:25:48,610 --> 00:25:53,380
and so they had very very strict ideas

00:25:51,429 --> 00:25:55,510
about data security and the reason we

00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:57,850
had those tags in our output is so that

00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:59,409
they could go through later scrape the

00:25:57,850 --> 00:26:00,460
output and stuff it into an Oracle

00:25:59,409 --> 00:26:04,179
database where it would be

00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:06,070
indestructible and saved forever because

00:26:04,179 --> 00:26:07,630
they were concerned about you know sort

00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:10,049
of ephemeral data they wanted to make

00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:11,830
sure that things were stored correctly

00:26:10,049 --> 00:26:16,720
you have to worry about distribution

00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:18,309
obviously a huge deal that create once

00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:20,110
published everywhere there's a lot of

00:26:18,309 --> 00:26:22,990
pressure to that okay I want to be able

00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:24,429
to write this once and it needs to go to

00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:27,159
my facebook page and used to go to my

00:26:24,429 --> 00:26:29,470
website needs to go to Twitter and those

00:26:27,159 --> 00:26:31,750
those things need to be those versions

00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:36,700
of the content need to be customized for

00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:38,289
those platforms right and yeah outside

00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:41,230
of distribution you do need intelligence

00:26:38,289 --> 00:26:43,510
you need information that helps you do

00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:46,330
your job better we'll talk about that

00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:48,970
here in a little bit and I'm doing well

00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:53,320
on time by the way we're at 28 after and

00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:56,980
I'm on slide 38 of 61 I promised to get

00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:58,990
us out on time your architecture is your

00:26:56,980 --> 00:27:00,580
structure this is again the sort of

00:26:58,990 --> 00:27:02,020
crucial point when people talk about

00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:04,120
content management systems one of the

00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:05,890
things that's made Drupal successful in

00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:10,000
particular is this concept of fielded

00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:12,010
data right it's the one thing that for

00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,020
years drupal had that WordPress didn't

00:27:12,010 --> 00:27:16,659
WordPress is getting into this is now

00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:19,659
filled the data simply means I don't

00:27:16,659 --> 00:27:21,549
have to just have one big glob of text

00:27:19,659 --> 00:27:23,529
that is my entire webpage the way

00:27:21,549 --> 00:27:25,779
Netscape Navigator used to do it i can

00:27:23,529 --> 00:27:29,559
divide it up into different pieces right

00:27:25,779 --> 00:27:31,960
I just rewrote my blog software and for

00:27:29,559 --> 00:27:36,549
my blog I have like six different pieces

00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:39,340
of data that I can tell right titles I

00:27:36,549 --> 00:27:41,440
have things like that drupal makes that

00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:43,240
again very very easy so filled the data

00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:45,220
is important you're editing workflow is

00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:47,470
important what are your approval

00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:51,370
processes what are your editing

00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:53,080
restrictions those are important and the

00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:54,340
reason I put this in place this work

00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:55,750
arounds I should have a

00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:57,850
a picture for it but it's the it's the

00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:59,140
classic you know if you tell people not

00:27:57,850 --> 00:28:01,270
to do something or if you force them

00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:04,120
into a workflow they will find ways to

00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:05,919
break it this is the biggest governance

00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:07,480
issue you have actually even though

00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:09,880
you've put a structure in place for

00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:12,880
people they're going to find ways to

00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:14,440
make their jobs easier right in my

00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:17,289
newsroom we always used to blame the

00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:19,120
sport reporters the sport reporters

00:28:17,289 --> 00:28:20,860
hated to follow the rules for their

00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:26,049
layouts they always break them because

00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:27,070
it was faster so again governance we

00:28:26,049 --> 00:28:29,950
talked about that a little bit

00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:31,600
governance is your standards yeah what

00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:33,370
to edit one of the big governance rules

00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:35,710
we work with a lot of universities and a

00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:38,470
lot of them need to review their content

00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:40,750
every year or every six months or they

00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:42,760
need to have historical revisions of

00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:45,159
policies they need to be able to say

00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:47,590
well this was our policy two years ago

00:28:45,159 --> 00:28:49,360
this is our policy now and there are

00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:52,120
federal regulations that force them so

00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:56,770
yeah what do i edit who can do that

00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:58,870
editing when do I do those edits how do

00:28:56,770 --> 00:29:00,820
I control who can make those at it's one

00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:03,760
of the contributions I do in Drupal is

00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:08,529
actually about this very issue of who

00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:10,750
can edit what based on permission but

00:29:08,529 --> 00:29:12,370
the more important governance question I

00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:13,899
ought to ask you of course is why why

00:29:12,370 --> 00:29:16,570
are you making this edit why is this

00:29:13,899 --> 00:29:17,799
change important right and why are the

00:29:16,570 --> 00:29:21,130
restrictions around those edits

00:29:17,799 --> 00:29:23,380
important right literally if you're

00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:26,350
going into a a content management

00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:28,480
project now and not thinking about these

00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:32,590
questions you're going to have a bad

00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:34,720
time it's going to be it's going to be

00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:36,730
painful right you need to sit down with

00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:38,950
your editors and say okay what's our

00:29:36,730 --> 00:29:41,169
workflow going to look like right what's

00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:45,100
the structure two things how do we want

00:29:41,169 --> 00:29:46,779
that to go we very much like to go to

00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:49,539
people's offices and watch them work

00:29:46,779 --> 00:29:52,840
when we start a project right and sit

00:29:49,539 --> 00:29:54,370
there and take notes okay and sometimes

00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:57,250
will watch them use their old systems

00:29:54,370 --> 00:30:00,039
and be like why did you skip that part

00:29:57,250 --> 00:30:02,060
oh that part's not important it was like

00:30:00,039 --> 00:30:04,480
the most important thing for us really

00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:09,200
why aren't you doing that oh it's hard

00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:10,490
okay so governance your governance rules

00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:14,560
will give you your standards for things

00:30:10,490 --> 00:30:17,900
that's really really critical you

00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:19,010
storage is just about data right how are

00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:20,360
you going to create it how are you going

00:30:19,010 --> 00:30:22,520
to retrieve it how you can archive it

00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:24,620
and it's really also about the data

00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:27,230
model right we wanted to get into that

00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:29,780
too much but there's a whole industry

00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:33,710
around this now right content strategy

00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:39,410
this whole idea of how do we model data

00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:41,450
so that we can be successful okay the

00:30:39,410 --> 00:30:44,180
distribution part again that's your

00:30:41,450 --> 00:30:46,370
audience right now consider what are

00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:47,600
your channels for distribution what are

00:30:46,370 --> 00:30:49,940
your methods to getting to those

00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:51,980
channels right we talked about I mean

00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:55,550
people want Twitter straight out of the

00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:58,460
CMS it's easy to do it's actually very

00:30:55,550 --> 00:31:00,740
easy to do what are the costs associated

00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:02,300
with that again important things do you

00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:04,370
have to go through you know elaborate

00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:07,160
partnerships to do certain things I know

00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:08,540
people in the united states are upset

00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:10,160
that you know Google's starting to put

00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:12,890
some restrictions on who can do certain

00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:14,510
things and if you are certain you have a

00:31:12,890 --> 00:31:15,970
certain partnership level with them you

00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:20,090
can do things that other people can't

00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:22,730
this sort of thing and then this is the

00:31:20,090 --> 00:31:24,290
the really important thing I guess as we

00:31:22,730 --> 00:31:27,950
get into the next bit which is about

00:31:24,290 --> 00:31:29,120
goals which is the real success is going

00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:32,270
to be based on actual business

00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:35,480
intelligence right what are people

00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:37,760
reading what are you doing with the

00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:39,830
information you're able to gather the

00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:41,720
biggest disappointment that I can

00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:43,850
remember in our newspaper career is we

00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:46,310
had a really nice piece of analytic

00:31:43,850 --> 00:31:50,030
software and then no one knew what to do

00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:53,210
with it so we had all this data right

00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:56,870
actually anyone in the room familiar

00:31:53,210 --> 00:31:58,340
with aqua a lift so the folks who wrote

00:31:56,870 --> 00:32:03,560
that software used to work for a company

00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:05,690
called omniture we used to use omniture

00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:08,930
in the newsroom and I'm not sure was

00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:10,880
awesome and it it captured all kinds of

00:32:08,930 --> 00:32:13,310
data and no one ever knew what to do

00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:14,660
with it so the folks that lift basically

00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:15,140
said well what if we took this data and

00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:17,300
told you

00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:19,990
what to do with it will do

00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:23,450
personalization based on the data boom

00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:27,620
success right it's just kind of

00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:31,400
fascinating so start thinking now again

00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:33,080
look how are we going to do this what

00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:34,430
information do we need how are we going

00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:35,960
to gather it how are we going to report

00:32:34,430 --> 00:32:38,090
it how are we going to understand it and

00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:39,290
then again this most important piece is

00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:45,680
what action are we going to take based

00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:48,400
on that right so we can get to the clear

00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:50,540
than the goal so hopefully I put forward

00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:52,250
some clear arguments for what you need

00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:55,010
it's like okay what are we going to do

00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:57,170
with it so number one direct quote hey

00:32:55,010 --> 00:33:01,760
I'm quoting myself you do not have a

00:32:57,170 --> 00:33:04,340
technology problem right with a possible

00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:06,410
exception of an ego because the need is

00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:08,680
one of our clients and he has to pass

00:33:06,410 --> 00:33:10,850
around gigabytes worth of climate data

00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:14,480
that's a little bit of a technology

00:33:10,850 --> 00:33:16,070
problem a little bit but it's great

00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:19,760
bendigo has a great project you should

00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:20,870
talk to him later the technology for

00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:25,430
most of these things is actually a

00:33:20,870 --> 00:33:26,960
commodity right the open source software

00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:28,370
you know committee has caught up to

00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:33,320
these things I mean these are solved

00:33:28,370 --> 00:33:34,160
problems right a lot of folks can get by

00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:36,440
there's a there's a

00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:38,930
software-as-a-service in the United

00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:41,030
States called hubspot and it does a lot

00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:43,550
of this for you you don't even need to

00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:46,550
buy a server if you don't want to it can

00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:48,620
be expensive not to but you generally

00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:52,190
don't have a technology problem those

00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:53,840
problems have been solved I also like to

00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:58,700
pull out this mark bolton quote because

00:33:53,840 --> 00:34:00,950
he's a little more famous than I am just

00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:02,480
because people worry about the

00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:05,830
technology so much and they don't

00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:10,100
actually describe the business problem

00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:15,520
or this is the worst case they vastly

00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:18,620
underestimate the human problem right we

00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:20,810
we sometimes talk to clients and they

00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:23,179
very clearly state their business case

00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:26,030
and then we tell them that's great you

00:34:23,179 --> 00:34:27,970
need to hire six people and they look at

00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:32,409
us like we have you know

00:34:27,970 --> 00:34:34,510
six eyes horns or like it's courey folk

00:34:32,409 --> 00:34:37,470
and we have the booth torches right did

00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:40,060
anyone else go to cora for by the way

00:34:37,470 --> 00:34:44,440
you missed out it was absolutely

00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:46,750
dangerous so yeah mark mark Bolton's the

00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:49,990
guy who by the way helped design the

00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:55,330
administrative theme for Drupal 7 the 70

00:34:49,990 --> 00:34:59,109
mark bolt so I'll show you a few Drupal

00:34:55,330 --> 00:35:01,260
things we're tinkering with like how do

00:34:59,109 --> 00:35:04,810
you give people actionable information

00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:08,230
all right this is just the basic you

00:35:04,810 --> 00:35:10,510
know hey here's Drupal stuff wait I put

00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:13,900
in the wrong no I didn't know excuse me

00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:17,380
I apologize we're doing different tech

00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:19,380
stuff I jumped ahead of myself so Drupal

00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:22,030
stuff how does Drupal make this happen

00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:25,480
okay let's say you want to distribute

00:35:22,030 --> 00:35:27,340
content as I said to my shoe or my Apple

00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:29,410
watch right what you need to be able to

00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:31,060
do is spit out a service that has the

00:35:29,410 --> 00:35:33,369
data in a structured format that other

00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:36,609
people can read you can do this in

00:35:33,369 --> 00:35:39,910
Drupal 8 in about five minutes through

00:35:36,609 --> 00:35:42,280
the user interface because you can go in

00:35:39,910 --> 00:35:45,760
and create with the this bottom one here

00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:50,440
this rest export rest export is simply a

00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:53,140
protocol for sending data to requests

00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:56,140
basically so someone says hey give me

00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:58,780
the last three things you published and

00:35:56,140 --> 00:36:00,099
it will send them this which doesn't

00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:02,710
look like anything but that's the whole

00:36:00,099 --> 00:36:03,970
point because it's the receiver it's the

00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:07,089
Apple watch on the other end or the

00:36:03,970 --> 00:36:09,010
blackberry or my shoe that's going to

00:36:07,089 --> 00:36:12,460
then turn this into something that you

00:36:09,010 --> 00:36:16,150
can act on right as a reader so that's

00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:21,070
really really important the question

00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:22,960
that I asked here is how many tools do

00:36:21,070 --> 00:36:25,690
you need to do these five things that

00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:27,369
I've outlined in a drupal stripper will

00:36:25,690 --> 00:36:29,619
tell you that it does four of them by

00:36:27,369 --> 00:36:31,420
the way drupal will tell you that it

00:36:29,619 --> 00:36:32,740
covers architecture governance storage

00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:34,300
and distribution it can do all those

00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:36,369
things distribution was the last piece

00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:40,000
we just looked at what it doesn't do of

00:36:36,369 --> 00:36:41,680
course is that intelligent piece right I

00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,089
like this too how many

00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:44,349
points of failure are there in your tool

00:36:43,089 --> 00:36:45,880
check there are five points of failure

00:36:44,349 --> 00:36:47,980
in your tool chain any one of these

00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:50,670
things if done incorrectly can really

00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:54,790
hamper you from achieving your goals

00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:57,760
right so how do we combine those right

00:36:54,790 --> 00:36:59,619
tools and again this is what we're

00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:01,630
kicking around from a when you think

00:36:59,619 --> 00:37:04,210
content management system when you think

00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:06,910
content strategy sort of the meat of it

00:37:04,210 --> 00:37:10,839
what are your analytics you know how are

00:37:06,910 --> 00:37:12,880
you auditing your content and a Content

00:37:10,839 --> 00:37:15,010
audit is a very very simple process it's

00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:17,440
just time consuming that says hey let's

00:37:15,010 --> 00:37:19,359
look at what we've produced how are

00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:23,290
people using it what value does it have

00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:25,059
is it written appropriately I don't I'm

00:37:23,290 --> 00:37:28,780
going to assume that things are similar

00:37:25,059 --> 00:37:30,369
in Europe but we are given the advice

00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:33,119
when working on government websites that

00:37:30,369 --> 00:37:35,500
they should be written for people with a

00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:38,020
primary school education not primary

00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:40,180
school secondary school education so 13

00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:46,089
to 14 years old that's like a government

00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:49,960
standard gov dot you Kang is writing for

00:37:46,089 --> 00:37:52,690
9 year olds yep that's about in the US

00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:55,660
it's 13 i think is the standard but 10

00:37:52,690 --> 00:37:58,030
or 11 is probably really good the the

00:37:55,660 --> 00:38:00,010
point being you want to make sure that

00:37:58,030 --> 00:38:02,020
people understand things I mean content

00:38:00,010 --> 00:38:03,730
audits will tell you things like most

00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:05,680
people know this like people like to

00:38:03,730 --> 00:38:08,200
read bullet lists they're much easier to

00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:10,390
read so it's very very good practice in

00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:12,069
many cases to start your article with

00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:13,359
here's the bullet points of the three

00:38:12,069 --> 00:38:14,650
things you're going to learn today or

00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:16,750
the three reasons you should read this

00:38:14,650 --> 00:38:19,839
article right the same reason I put out

00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:21,010
an agenda on slide three these are this

00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:22,780
is how we're going to go through it and

00:38:21,010 --> 00:38:23,589
then people can scan it very quickly and

00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:25,930
decide if they're going to read the

00:38:23,589 --> 00:38:29,260
whole thing or not so yeah content on

00:38:25,930 --> 00:38:35,230
its yeah governance and workflow so what

00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:38,440
might that look like this is a slightly

00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:41,290
modified version of drupal's editorial

00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:44,650
interface again just a list of content

00:38:41,290 --> 00:38:47,380
and all we've added is a status to it at

00:38:44,650 --> 00:38:49,150
the moment like hey we've gone through

00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:51,670
and done an audit what action needs to

00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:54,069
be taken next someone needs to add an

00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:55,060
image to it someone needs to review it

00:38:54,069 --> 00:38:57,520
oh this has been a

00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:59,170
this idea of going through and setting

00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:00,730
the next action to take and then

00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:02,320
assigning that action to someone on your

00:39:00,730 --> 00:39:04,150
staff I think is really really important

00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:07,030
the other piece that I think is going to

00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:09,580
be really interesting and I promise to

00:39:07,030 --> 00:39:13,060
talk some about analytics and then I

00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:15,730
probably didn't fulfill it I apologize

00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:19,720
is integrating analytics directly into

00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:22,690
the editing experience right how many

00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:24,040
people are looking at this page right we

00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:26,560
have unique visits here the bottom of

00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:29,020
this percentage of direct and indirect

00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:30,700
traffic one of our one of our project

00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:32,740
excuse me project managers and

00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:34,030
strategist used to work at one of the

00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:36,580
three biggest newspapers in the country

00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:38,950
and he loves those two numbers that

00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:42,190
percentage of indirect and direct

00:39:38,950 --> 00:39:45,340
traffic direct traffic are people who

00:39:42,190 --> 00:39:48,700
literally type in your URL and go to it

00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:50,890
and nobody ever does that in direct

00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:51,940
traffic is you know did to get you

00:39:50,890 --> 00:39:55,030
through search did they follow a

00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:57,730
facebook like those sorts of things yeah

00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:59,620
what's your bounce rate bounce rate of

00:39:57,730 --> 00:40:02,740
course means people who look at that

00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:04,210
page for less than and less than the

00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:06,310
amount of time you need to actually read

00:40:04,210 --> 00:40:08,710
it which means they hit it and then they

00:40:06,310 --> 00:40:10,990
left immediately and then this the exit

00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:13,060
array which means for how many people

00:40:10,990 --> 00:40:16,360
was this the only page or the last page

00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:18,550
they looked at on your site right now

00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:21,400
it's possible to have a good that a high

00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:23,260
exit rate is good if like the page is

00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:25,960
actually solving the problem the person

00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:29,230
has but these are generally flags that

00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:31,360
you have bad content so thinking about

00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:33,640
ya how do we integrate this in in a way

00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:35,770
that editors can actually respond to it

00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:37,330
because the the I mean the great thing

00:40:35,770 --> 00:40:39,730
about google analytics and that's what

00:40:37,330 --> 00:40:43,180
this is is that all that data is present

00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:46,690
but it's sort of siloed away from editor

00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:49,480
doing our normal jobs right and it's

00:40:46,690 --> 00:40:51,280
very very difficult to do this kind of

00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:53,230
work I mean if you ever do a Content

00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:55,480
audit the basic strategy for doing a

00:40:53,230 --> 00:40:58,810
Content audit is to use a giant Excel

00:40:55,480 --> 00:41:00,430
spreadsheet yeah I see at least one

00:40:58,810 --> 00:41:03,940
person weeping silently in the front

00:41:00,430 --> 00:41:05,680
yeah we have tools that will let us do

00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:08,370
that why don't we just do it natively in

00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:08,370
the CMS

00:41:08,410 --> 00:41:13,150
right we can prepare our content right

00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:15,340
here and then again you know we're

00:41:13,150 --> 00:41:17,020
really gets fascinating is this doesn't

00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:18,730
even need to be my presentation engine I

00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:20,770
can do all my content preparation right

00:41:18,730 --> 00:41:23,260
here and thence indicate it out using

00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:24,370
that rest api that i showed you right as

00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:25,870
you're going around the rest of this

00:41:24,370 --> 00:41:27,570
week for the non-technical when you see

00:41:25,870 --> 00:41:30,490
sessions where they say headless

00:41:27,570 --> 00:41:32,230
headless drupal that means drupal

00:41:30,490 --> 00:41:34,000
doesn't actually render your webpage it

00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:36,640
just provides data and other things

00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:38,920
render your web page i also known as

00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:43,630
decoupled it's like really really

00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:48,160
exciting stuff but what would i like to

00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:49,870
say this is the important thing yeah

00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:51,250
they're going to larry you'll probably

00:41:49,870 --> 00:41:52,960
use this in his talk to I actually

00:41:51,250 --> 00:41:54,610
looked I looked up what this actually

00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:56,830
means this is called the law of the

00:41:54,610 --> 00:41:59,740
instrument they call the law of the

00:41:56,830 --> 00:42:01,540
instrument meaning the paradigm you're

00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:03,670
used to the way of thinking that you're

00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:07,570
used to tends to color everything that

00:42:03,670 --> 00:42:09,070
you do right so if you're used to if you

00:42:07,570 --> 00:42:10,800
again come from a print background

00:42:09,070 --> 00:42:13,920
you're used to thinking in terms of

00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:16,240
layout and space and juxtaposition

00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:17,670
that's not relevant when you're

00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:20,110
designing a content management system

00:42:17,670 --> 00:42:22,690
there is a tweak one of the people who's

00:42:20,110 --> 00:42:24,190
speaking right now Morton Morton's one

00:42:22,690 --> 00:42:26,170
of the leaders of the front-end group

00:42:24,190 --> 00:42:29,950
the folks who do all the the output and

00:42:26,170 --> 00:42:32,560
the HTML for Drupal and I forgot where I

00:42:29,950 --> 00:42:36,040
was going with that Morton story he had

00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:37,960
a tweet earlier today oh he had a tweet

00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:40,420
earlier today where he said no we're not

00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:43,300
putting an HTML editor into into the

00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:44,830
user interface that's not appropriate we

00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:47,260
don't even want you thinking about that

00:42:44,830 --> 00:42:49,450
all right that's not what the tool is

00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:51,700
for the tool is for the structure right

00:42:49,450 --> 00:42:53,110
so this law of the instrument the piece

00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:54,310
that I would ask is you have where's the

00:42:53,110 --> 00:42:56,770
most critical failure in the

00:42:54,310 --> 00:43:01,090
organization and again it's probably in

00:42:56,770 --> 00:43:02,590
this intelligence I would really really

00:43:01,090 --> 00:43:04,480
urge you I do this in all of my tops

00:43:02,590 --> 00:43:05,830
that it's the people who are actually to

00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:08,800
make the most difference here you want

00:43:05,830 --> 00:43:12,310
to invest in those resources not the

00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:15,670
technology resources right technology

00:43:12,310 --> 00:43:18,400
changes strategy will adapt to those

00:43:15,670 --> 00:43:20,079
changes but people are the thing that

00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:23,589
will keep coming back

00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:24,849
right there's that great the great story

00:43:23,589 --> 00:43:26,319
what happens when you hire the wrong

00:43:24,849 --> 00:43:30,789
person how long does it take you to

00:43:26,319 --> 00:43:33,430
recover from that bad hire so it is much

00:43:30,789 --> 00:43:35,109
much better to invest in the right tools

00:43:33,430 --> 00:43:39,759
and the right people as you're getting

00:43:35,109 --> 00:43:43,359
started so I did promise a little bit

00:43:39,759 --> 00:43:45,910
about analytics the big questions how

00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:47,170
are people finding you right they're

00:43:45,910 --> 00:43:48,519
coming to you directly or they're coming

00:43:47,170 --> 00:43:50,200
to you through search are they coming

00:43:48,519 --> 00:43:53,769
through to you through social networks

00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:55,269
right and then what's happening when

00:43:53,769 --> 00:43:57,549
they get there what are your top pages

00:43:55,269 --> 00:44:00,029
what are your top bounces you know what

00:43:57,549 --> 00:44:02,200
are people doing when they get to the

00:44:00,029 --> 00:44:03,729
tracking those things and then feeding

00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:07,749
them back into the editorial workflow

00:44:03,729 --> 00:44:10,719
are really really important put another

00:44:07,749 --> 00:44:11,799
way the big business questions here

00:44:10,719 --> 00:44:14,440
again from a content strategy

00:44:11,799 --> 00:44:15,849
perspective have to do with what what do

00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:19,390
you value is an organization what's

00:44:15,849 --> 00:44:21,369
important right and in particular it's

00:44:19,390 --> 00:44:24,910
not this is really challenging we're

00:44:21,369 --> 00:44:27,390
doing a project right now with a firm we

00:44:24,910 --> 00:44:29,979
did their redesign their a hospital

00:44:27,390 --> 00:44:31,719
they're redesign is all about doctors

00:44:29,979 --> 00:44:34,329
and it's all about making the doctors

00:44:31,719 --> 00:44:35,799
feel important and the problem for that

00:44:34,329 --> 00:44:38,859
is that I don't know the difference

00:44:35,799 --> 00:44:41,199
between lymphoma and leukemia right so

00:44:38,859 --> 00:44:44,079
when I go in and search the site or try

00:44:41,199 --> 00:44:46,150
to find information I'm confused because

00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:50,199
it's written for people with medical

00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:51,339
degrees it's not written for it's three

00:44:50,199 --> 00:44:54,670
o'clock in the morning and my child

00:44:51,339 --> 00:44:55,900
won't stop vomiting which is the more

00:44:54,670 --> 00:44:59,319
important question because it's a

00:44:55,900 --> 00:45:01,119
children's hospital right so we're doing

00:44:59,319 --> 00:45:03,039
another piece with them to re-examine

00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:04,449
how people interact with their content

00:45:03,039 --> 00:45:07,239
what kind of questions they're they're

00:45:04,449 --> 00:45:09,219
trying to solve right so yeah how do you

00:45:07,239 --> 00:45:13,319
make that easy and how do you track that

00:45:09,219 --> 00:45:13,319
people are doing what is important right

00:45:13,529 --> 00:45:19,390
so then those last two questions yeah do

00:45:17,410 --> 00:45:21,640
you have a CMS or web publishing tool

00:45:19,390 --> 00:45:23,049
yeah are you building pages or are you

00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:26,170
actually driving interactions that

00:45:23,049 --> 00:45:28,509
matter right so that is the end of my

00:45:26,170 --> 00:45:30,609
formal presentation we do have time for

00:45:28,509 --> 00:45:31,599
questions I believe we're going till six

00:45:30,609 --> 00:45:34,220
is all right

00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:47,030
we've got 14 whole minutes for questions

00:45:34,220 --> 00:45:48,530
or you get bonus free time thank you and

00:45:47,030 --> 00:45:52,190
they have asked me to use the microphone

00:45:48,530 --> 00:45:54,470
if you do have a question I'll give you

00:45:52,190 --> 00:45:56,240
a fun story that isn't mine and then ask

00:45:54,470 --> 00:45:58,220
the question you asked you mentioned the

00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:59,510
comment to do with people always trying

00:45:58,220 --> 00:46:02,420
to gain the system and particularly

00:45:59,510 --> 00:46:04,940
sports journalists martin de them who

00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:07,550
used to be in the Guardian he had a

00:46:04,940 --> 00:46:11,150
great story that I hope it's him this is

00:46:07,550 --> 00:46:12,890
the BBC where and that they they were

00:46:11,150 --> 00:46:14,930
trying to get sports people to use the

00:46:12,890 --> 00:46:16,309
system for the you know reporting

00:46:14,930 --> 00:46:18,440
results and everything and everyone

00:46:16,309 --> 00:46:20,630
hated it apart from the people that were

00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:22,670
in the little villages in England

00:46:20,630 --> 00:46:24,200
because they realized that if they put

00:46:22,670 --> 00:46:26,859
all the data and properly they would

00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:28,520
come up top on the sports pages so

00:46:26,859 --> 00:46:31,579
something if there's an incentive

00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:33,290
there's a way my question which is I

00:46:31,579 --> 00:46:35,480
guess what you were starting to touch on

00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:37,640
at the end I do content strategy and a

00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:39,410
lot of persona stuff and we're really

00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:41,750
getting excited you're trying to get

00:46:39,410 --> 00:46:43,730
people to think about personas and then

00:46:41,750 --> 00:46:44,660
write the content based on the personas

00:46:43,730 --> 00:46:47,089
and then even start using

00:46:44,660 --> 00:46:48,440
personalization to you know not only be

00:46:47,089 --> 00:46:50,390
able to say well you know we know that

00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:52,130
page is for this you know person like

00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:53,720
you know the person who's got a child

00:46:52,130 --> 00:46:55,910
you know three o'clock in the morning as

00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:57,650
opposed to a doctor and then also been

00:46:55,910 --> 00:46:59,809
able to figure out that you know later

00:46:57,650 --> 00:47:01,369
on that based on them going to that page

00:46:59,809 --> 00:47:02,930
in that page in that page they must be a

00:47:01,369 --> 00:47:05,359
parent we can give them more information

00:47:02,930 --> 00:47:06,770
and I know that list as that but we

00:47:05,359 --> 00:47:08,930
haven't played with it yet so have you

00:47:06,770 --> 00:47:09,859
sort of had I guess the question is have

00:47:08,930 --> 00:47:11,420
you been looking have you had a chance

00:47:09,859 --> 00:47:14,390
to look at any of this stuff relating to

00:47:11,420 --> 00:47:18,500
personas and and content and sort of you

00:47:14,390 --> 00:47:20,780
know personalization I have but I don't

00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:23,900
have a simple or fast answer to that

00:47:20,780 --> 00:47:26,359
question and I can say specifically sort

00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:28,160
of is there and so is it and there are

00:47:26,359 --> 00:47:29,750
other systems I don't know if people

00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:31,339
know sitecore which does

00:47:29,750 --> 00:47:34,010
personalizations you can sort of tag

00:47:31,339 --> 00:47:36,140
pages and then say I think this page is

00:47:34,010 --> 00:47:37,400
going to be related to you know this if

00:47:36,140 --> 00:47:39,200
someone looks at this page they'll be a

00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:41,280
parent and then you can sort of track

00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:43,290
things similar is that sort of similar

00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:45,420
thing that that lift is it's going to

00:47:43,290 --> 00:47:46,950
end up doing yeah lift can lift will do

00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:49,440
something like you can do that in Drupal

00:47:46,950 --> 00:47:51,540
natively now just because I mean Drupal

00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:53,790
has a taxonomy system it has for a long

00:47:51,540 --> 00:47:56,010
time and so you can if you're just going

00:47:53,790 --> 00:47:58,080
to structure along these things are

00:47:56,010 --> 00:47:59,880
related that's very very simple to do

00:47:58,080 --> 00:48:01,590
you can even do you know you can have

00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:03,240
structured taxonomy and you can have you

00:48:01,590 --> 00:48:04,740
know freeform taxonomy where editors

00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:09,690
could just make random collections of

00:48:04,740 --> 00:48:14,280
things so what what lifts tries to do is

00:48:09,690 --> 00:48:16,080
say given that we can infer this about

00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:17,670
this person either by reading their

00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:20,730
browser history or however they gather

00:48:17,670 --> 00:48:23,850
that analytics data you then sort of

00:48:20,730 --> 00:48:25,770
program in content suggestions to say

00:48:23,850 --> 00:48:27,930
okay given that we've identified that

00:48:25,770 --> 00:48:30,720
you're from the UK as opposed to from

00:48:27,930 --> 00:48:34,140
Belgium we're going to present this to

00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:36,750
you instead of this so you can do that

00:48:34,140 --> 00:48:38,610
without live you can do that it's funny

00:48:36,750 --> 00:48:41,520
we just had this conversation with a

00:48:38,610 --> 00:48:42,930
team who's doing a project now I oh so

00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:44,340
we're going to do personalization what's

00:48:42,930 --> 00:48:46,380
that going to look like like well you're

00:48:44,340 --> 00:48:49,110
going to talk to the client and find out

00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:51,590
what they want to do right in many cases

00:48:49,110 --> 00:48:54,030
it's geo location is the big deal right

00:48:51,590 --> 00:48:55,710
and the simple version of that is just

00:48:54,030 --> 00:48:57,480
like language switching right you can do

00:48:55,710 --> 00:49:01,080
automated you know geo-located language

00:48:57,480 --> 00:49:03,270
switching in many systems so I hope that

00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:05,490
sort of gets to what you're asking yeah

00:49:03,270 --> 00:49:07,500
I guess I'm curious just because I think

00:49:05,490 --> 00:49:09,000
it's a hard call people don't always

00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:10,650
understand personas they don't

00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,910
understand content strategy but it's

00:49:10,650 --> 00:49:13,470
bringing that part again you're talking

00:49:11,910 --> 00:49:15,660
about the action shown to bring it all

00:49:13,470 --> 00:49:17,550
together so I guess it's just a general

00:49:15,660 --> 00:49:19,080
thing which I'm sort of think hope that

00:49:17,550 --> 00:49:21,090
people know about because it suddenly

00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:22,980
makes it relevant I I would reinforce

00:49:21,090 --> 00:49:25,560
the concept of the persona how many of

00:49:22,980 --> 00:49:26,730
you understand what personas are so i

00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:30,600
don't have to hit it too hard yeah

00:49:26,730 --> 00:49:33,270
personas yes do persona mapping and do

00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:34,590
persona ranking persona ranking is very

00:49:33,270 --> 00:49:36,060
very important we did this this

00:49:34,590 --> 00:49:38,160
children's hospital it was fascinating

00:49:36,060 --> 00:49:40,140
us we had we had about this many people

00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:42,510
in the room and they all represented

00:49:40,140 --> 00:49:44,910
different parts of the organization and

00:49:42,510 --> 00:49:47,460
who is one woman who was quiet the

00:49:44,910 --> 00:49:50,160
entire time because it was her third

00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:52,680
week on the job and she worked in major

00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:54,090
gifts which means she was responsible

00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:54,720
for getting people to give them lots of

00:49:54,090 --> 00:49:57,810
money

00:49:54,720 --> 00:50:01,590
and she said well what about the persona

00:49:57,810 --> 00:50:04,260
of these people how important are they

00:50:01,590 --> 00:50:06,810
where do they fit into this so a persona

00:50:04,260 --> 00:50:09,330
mapping of course lets you understand

00:50:06,810 --> 00:50:12,800
yeah who are you targeting and why are

00:50:09,330 --> 00:50:12,800
you targeting them yeah

00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:26,859
so

00:50:38,170 --> 00:50:45,820
right so the point i'm repeating for for

00:50:42,670 --> 00:50:48,040
posterity was that you might not if with

00:50:45,820 --> 00:50:49,570
proper analytics and proper automated

00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:51,130
actions on those analytics you don't

00:50:49,570 --> 00:50:54,280
need personas anymore because they will

00:50:51,130 --> 00:50:55,570
auto generate right then okay i'll plug

00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:57,490
is where knock we a partner if you go

00:50:55,570 --> 00:50:59,380
downstairs to the Aqua booth they'd love

00:50:57,490 --> 00:51:01,090
to explain lift they would love to tell

00:50:59,380 --> 00:51:06,370
you about it and it does work with non

00:51:01,090 --> 00:51:08,260
Drupal things too yeah and going back to

00:51:06,370 --> 00:51:10,570
analytics pointless so the innate

00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:12,700
analytics third journalism I've done a

00:51:10,570 --> 00:51:14,920
couple of sites not just in Drupal way

00:51:12,700 --> 00:51:17,170
we've had that so they can go back and

00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:19,300
see the number of page views that

00:51:17,170 --> 00:51:22,480
bounced right nor the rest of it and all

00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:25,300
its led to is an absolute lack of

00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:26,980
understanding of why those things go up

00:51:25,300 --> 00:51:29,530
and down yeah they say a bigger number

00:51:26,980 --> 00:51:31,480
that's great but that does that doesn't

00:51:29,530 --> 00:51:33,520
help them be better content strategists

00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:34,630
it doesn't help them understand when

00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:36,400
they're writing well or when they're

00:51:34,630 --> 00:51:38,020
writing badly because of the sheer

00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:39,490
number of variables that that could be

00:51:38,020 --> 00:51:42,100
about you know whether the story is any

00:51:39,490 --> 00:51:45,970
good if well-written uninteresting story

00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:48,010
is still uninteresting so and going back

00:51:45,970 --> 00:51:50,410
again to the gov you k example one of

00:51:48,010 --> 00:51:52,660
the first things that GDS did was strip

00:51:50,410 --> 00:51:54,580
the rights for individual departments to

00:51:52,660 --> 00:51:58,110
even have access to their analytics

00:51:54,580 --> 00:51:58,110
because they were so often used as

00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:08,110
policy based evidence making so now what

00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:10,360
point is six small measures of analytics

00:52:08,110 --> 00:52:12,070
that actually take each page out of the

00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:15,940
flow of what a user journey looks like

00:52:12,070 --> 00:52:18,910
how do we prevent bad use of analytics

00:52:15,940 --> 00:52:21,070
with that feature and how do we promote

00:52:18,910 --> 00:52:23,860
good use of an understanding of a user

00:52:21,070 --> 00:52:26,410
journey through numbers right and I

00:52:23,860 --> 00:52:28,210
think the answer to that is that we're

00:52:26,410 --> 00:52:30,070
thinking about things more crudely so so

00:52:28,210 --> 00:52:33,160
here we have hammer the hammer and the

00:52:30,070 --> 00:52:34,690
nail problem right that okay so we're

00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:36,670
not even conceptualising of this

00:52:34,690 --> 00:52:37,810
correctly the real the real thing is are

00:52:36,670 --> 00:52:42,100
they actually taking it a worthwhile

00:52:37,810 --> 00:52:44,920
action right when we talk about again

00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:47,470
guy my team Joe Allen black used to work

00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:48,790
for boston.com huge website and he used

00:52:47,470 --> 00:52:51,569
to be in charge of the analytics and all

00:52:48,790 --> 00:52:53,789
these things he liked to talk about key

00:52:51,569 --> 00:52:56,279
performance indicators his KPIs he loves

00:52:53,789 --> 00:52:57,539
his cape eons and when we talked to

00:52:56,279 --> 00:52:59,239
clients about kpi's we actually don't

00:52:57,539 --> 00:53:01,979
talk about analytics we talk about

00:52:59,239 --> 00:53:03,390
conversions right and so that you know

00:53:01,979 --> 00:53:05,160
the best analytic software is actually

00:53:03,390 --> 00:53:06,509
about a conversion tracking right we

00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:08,759
just did a project that was actually

00:53:06,509 --> 00:53:11,339
kind of painful because they wanted us

00:53:08,759 --> 00:53:14,519
to tag every single link specifically

00:53:11,339 --> 00:53:16,319
for google and barometer actually so

00:53:14,519 --> 00:53:17,670
that they could track exactly how people

00:53:16,319 --> 00:53:20,039
were getting places so that they could

00:53:17,670 --> 00:53:22,619
use that to make some information so

00:53:20,039 --> 00:53:24,599
yeah a better question might be can we

00:53:22,619 --> 00:53:29,180
use the analytic to present to an editor

00:53:24,599 --> 00:53:31,709
or to an auditor this is where this page

00:53:29,180 --> 00:53:34,589
exists in the standard flow for people

00:53:31,709 --> 00:53:35,849
this is you know people that might be

00:53:34,589 --> 00:53:37,440
interesting to know right this is

00:53:35,849 --> 00:53:41,190
typically the third page that someone

00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:42,509
loves and then they tend to leave or I

00:53:41,190 --> 00:53:45,119
suppose the question here is again the

00:53:42,509 --> 00:53:46,709
other every nail looks like a Drupal

00:53:45,119 --> 00:53:49,529
mail at that point like if you have

00:53:46,709 --> 00:53:51,989
google analytics is it is it sensible

00:53:49,529 --> 00:53:54,420
per client to just train them to use

00:53:51,989 --> 00:53:57,299
analytics for at least a certain number

00:53:54,420 --> 00:54:00,049
of content editors oh you know pyrrhic

00:53:57,299 --> 00:54:04,349
or whatever they choose to use or is it

00:54:00,049 --> 00:54:06,390
how can the CMS take on that role or is

00:54:04,349 --> 00:54:07,859
it sensible to follow the sort of

00:54:06,390 --> 00:54:13,349
chunking of things into the appropriate

00:54:07,859 --> 00:54:15,479
tool for the appropriate job right and I

00:54:13,349 --> 00:54:17,130
don't have an answer to that I I just

00:54:15,479 --> 00:54:18,390
say when you're thinking about your CMS

00:54:17,130 --> 00:54:20,459
you need to be thinking about these

00:54:18,390 --> 00:54:23,999
things because I think they're relevant

00:54:20,459 --> 00:54:26,999
so it's conversation we can have all

00:54:23,999 --> 00:54:29,630
week right yeah I do not claim to have

00:54:26,999 --> 00:54:32,910
all the answers I just claimed to have

00:54:29,630 --> 00:54:35,609
valuable questions yeah for the record I

00:54:32,910 --> 00:54:40,709
have like 20 50 vision because my

00:54:35,609 --> 00:54:43,619
eyesight's really bad so I bought new

00:54:40,709 --> 00:54:48,410
glasses just last week they don't fit my

00:54:43,619 --> 00:54:50,489
face so I couldn't even wear them 20 20

00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:51,900
what's really like I said one of the

00:54:50,489 --> 00:54:55,049
guys I work with is down the hall

00:54:51,900 --> 00:54:56,640
talking about 20 20 Drupal like what's

00:54:55,049 --> 00:55:01,230
that going to look like hopefully we're

00:54:56,640 --> 00:55:04,170
saying the same thing but so

00:55:01,230 --> 00:55:06,390
yeah I mean analytics you know in a way

00:55:04,170 --> 00:55:09,119
are that blunt that there's a hammer to

00:55:06,390 --> 00:55:10,320
their the the same problem of well we

00:55:09,119 --> 00:55:11,940
think this is the way to get the

00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:14,400
actionable intelligence we need but

00:55:11,940 --> 00:55:17,130
maybe it's not by this is again why

00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:18,540
those those folks went off left omniture

00:55:17,130 --> 00:55:21,600
to build was now lived because they're

00:55:18,540 --> 00:55:23,850
like there's an easier way why show the

00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:28,070
analytics to people let's just act on

00:55:23,850 --> 00:55:28,070
them right yeah

00:55:54,550 --> 00:55:57,550
related

00:56:06,109 --> 00:56:08,170
you

00:56:31,260 --> 00:56:39,940
right so their question as I understand

00:56:34,180 --> 00:56:41,890
it is excuse me what kind of tools that

00:56:39,940 --> 00:56:43,660
we've seen for helping people write

00:56:41,890 --> 00:56:45,660
better content or making better choices

00:56:43,660 --> 00:56:51,990
about what content is related

00:56:45,660 --> 00:56:51,990
essentially right

00:56:57,140 --> 00:56:59,799
right

00:57:01,750 --> 00:57:04,750
right

00:57:05,819 --> 00:57:10,829
right there are a number of ways to do

00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:12,930
that we used to use back in my newspaper

00:57:10,829 --> 00:57:16,349
days we used to use a system called DTI

00:57:12,930 --> 00:57:18,089
and dt i had a like a search box baked

00:57:16,349 --> 00:57:20,549
into the editorial interface so you

00:57:18,089 --> 00:57:21,930
could actually go in and and look for

00:57:20,549 --> 00:57:24,329
things and I've seen people implement

00:57:21,930 --> 00:57:26,910
pieces like that in Drupal it's actually

00:57:24,329 --> 00:57:29,609
really easy to do with taxonomy I for

00:57:26,910 --> 00:57:32,459
editorial for editorial teams what I

00:57:29,609 --> 00:57:34,469
like to do actually is you have one

00:57:32,459 --> 00:57:36,479
taxon it's sort of a fixed tax on it

00:57:34,469 --> 00:57:38,549
your public sees and then you have some

00:57:36,479 --> 00:57:40,979
private taxonomy for your teams it's

00:57:38,549 --> 00:57:43,949
like well I'm going to tag this as you

00:57:40,979 --> 00:57:45,660
know Barcelona 2015 because that might

00:57:43,949 --> 00:57:47,699
be important three years from now right

00:57:45,660 --> 00:57:49,949
and I want to be able to come back and

00:57:47,699 --> 00:57:52,859
find I used to do this when I used to

00:57:49,949 --> 00:57:54,420
run in my site Weaver we used to have

00:57:52,859 --> 00:57:55,829
discussions every once awhile I was like

00:57:54,420 --> 00:57:58,920
hey if we seem like two or three

00:57:55,829 --> 00:58:00,690
articles on that same topic let's spin

00:57:58,920 --> 00:58:02,609
up a tag for that and we would actually

00:58:00,690 --> 00:58:06,479
start building historical archives on

00:58:02,609 --> 00:58:08,549
that i have seen systems that try to run

00:58:06,479 --> 00:58:10,469
like automatic automated searches off

00:58:08,549 --> 00:58:12,479
titles i know you you're entering this

00:58:10,469 --> 00:58:14,969
title and it'll pull up related things

00:58:12,479 --> 00:58:18,390
that would be kind of fascinating to do

00:58:14,969 --> 00:58:19,739
in some respects i mean i could see like

00:58:18,390 --> 00:58:21,719
this vision now it'd be fun to write

00:58:19,739 --> 00:58:23,880
from a programming standpoint like okay

00:58:21,719 --> 00:58:25,979
you've entered your title for your story

00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:29,459
let's run a google search and see what

00:58:25,979 --> 00:58:33,029
it pulls back okay and display that over

00:58:29,459 --> 00:58:35,630
here you can I don't know if that'd be

00:58:33,029 --> 00:58:35,630
useful or not

00:58:45,010 --> 00:58:47,670
right

00:58:49,510 --> 00:58:55,720
yes

00:58:52,180 --> 00:58:57,730
now I mean I'm also going back to Saudi

00:58:55,720 --> 00:58:59,589
TI was this system we used for print

00:58:57,730 --> 00:59:02,079
newspapers right and it was interesting

00:58:59,589 --> 00:59:04,660
cuz the page layout tool and the copy

00:59:02,079 --> 00:59:06,730
editing tool were different and actually

00:59:04,660 --> 00:59:08,559
didn't want most of the writers to be in

00:59:06,730 --> 00:59:10,089
the page layout tool they wanted them

00:59:08,559 --> 00:59:12,460
just to be looking at that blank white

00:59:10,089 --> 00:59:14,050
just write the story don't don't worry

00:59:12,460 --> 00:59:16,180
about how it lays out just write the

00:59:14,050 --> 00:59:19,089
story and I think that's kind of

00:59:16,180 --> 00:59:21,730
interesting and we do I think we see

00:59:19,089 --> 00:59:23,109
sometimes that you know as technology

00:59:21,730 --> 00:59:25,960
folks and especially the developers we

00:59:23,109 --> 00:59:29,460
really really like structured data but

00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:32,770
structured data can be very cumbersome

00:59:29,460 --> 00:59:34,210
to the creative process like are going

00:59:32,770 --> 00:59:36,210
to stop and think about how I'm going to

00:59:34,210 --> 00:59:38,260
fill out these eight pieces of the form

00:59:36,210 --> 00:59:41,109
rather than actually write the story

00:59:38,260 --> 00:59:42,730
that does come up to that question again

00:59:41,109 --> 00:59:44,770
that I brought up a you know where does

00:59:42,730 --> 00:59:46,359
your first right through happen right

00:59:44,770 --> 00:59:48,550
and what tools do you need to make that

00:59:46,359 --> 00:59:50,349
successful you know if I actually still

00:59:48,550 --> 00:59:52,030
wanted to write a full long-form piece I

00:59:50,349 --> 00:59:56,349
wouldn't use Drupal I would probably use

00:59:52,030 --> 00:59:57,819
word or a text editor all right just

00:59:56,349 --> 01:00:03,190
because I'm more comfortable there it's

00:59:57,819 --> 01:00:05,380
less distraction all right we are over

01:00:03,190 --> 01:00:07,180
time again we can have this conversation

01:00:05,380 --> 01:00:10,470
all week I appreciate everyone coming I

01:00:07,180 --> 01:00:10,470
