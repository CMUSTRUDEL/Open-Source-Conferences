Title: DrupalCon Barcelona 2015: 2020 Vision:  Reimagining Content Management
Publication date: 2015-09-22
Playlist: DrupalCon Barcelona - September 2015
Description: 
	You’ve probably been through a site redesign before, so you know the inherent challenges and how it exposes content structure problems, outdated content, and content that’s simply no longer relevant to your current users. You go through the painstaking process of working with your internal IT staff or an external vendor to map your existing content to the new structure that is targeted to your new audience. Problem is, this change is only for the new structure, and will have to be done again. There has to be a better way.

What if there was an approach to monitoring and auditing your content at strategic points throughout the year to effectively flag changes in your user’s behavior so that you can position content more appropriately? This important, ongoing process shouldn’t be as arduous as a full content migration, and may just be something you actually like to do.

In this talk we will unpack the strategy—not a technical solution—behind this thinking, and how the right kind of planning can help you make the right strategic decisions and understand the true scope and value of what you’re taking on.  Things like:

Content Strategy
Auditing (much of which are not solved with technology)
Help verify proper tools to provide actionable data
Audience, traffic behavior, and target metrics
Publishing volume and throughput (how much, how often)
Governance rules you can live with
How to apply the data, and what to impact
How this impacts marketing (positioning, social strategy, customer funnel, etc.)
Whether you have ample funding, or just received an unfunded mandate, the first steps are understanding your content lifecycle, and then set up a renewable process to ensure you’re targeting your audience correctly and staying current on a regular basis.
