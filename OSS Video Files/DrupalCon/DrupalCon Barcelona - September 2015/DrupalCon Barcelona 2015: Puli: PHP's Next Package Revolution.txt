Title: DrupalCon Barcelona 2015: Puli: PHP's Next Package Revolution
Publication date: 2015-09-22
Playlist: DrupalCon Barcelona - September 2015
Description: 
	The development of Composer packages is thriving. But many packages are developed for a specific framework. You're using no or a different framework? Tough luck. Puli, a new toolkit built on top of Composer, is a step to fix this problem. With Puli, you can create packages that can be enabled in your project (Plug 'n Play) simply by running "composer install" - independent of any framework. Are you ready for the future of PHP?
