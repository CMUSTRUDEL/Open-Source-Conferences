Title: DrupalCon Barcelona 2015: Serving the Internet of Things (IoT) with Drupal
Publication date: 2015-09-22
Playlist: DrupalCon Barcelona - September 2015
Description: 
	Digitalization is accelerating and more and more services are going online. This also means that we have more and more different devices that do internet. All these services need your content (or your customer's content) fed into them.

Headless Drupal usually means we're just separating the theming layer to a front-end theming library. How about not having a head at all? How do you serve a plethora of different devices with Drupal? How do you provide all the necessary data, services and control without having any control of the front-end?

In this presentation we'll go through the basics of serving the Internet of Things with the help of a headless Drupal. We'll look on how it's done today with Drupal 7 and how much easier it is to do on Drupal 8. The presentation will focus on the architecture level of building a web distribution platform capable of serving all services needed.

The speaker has been working professionally with Drupal since version 5 and currently focuses on the architectures of challenging Drupal setups.
