Description: 
	If you are working with Drupal 7 and you want to know how to do it in Drupal 8, this is your session!

Drupal 8 has become more powerful and flexible out of the box for site builders. During this session we will walk around the administration of Drupal 8 to do what a site builder usually do, we will comment all the improvements that you will find in Drupal 8 as well as the differences and changes between Drupal 7 and 8.

We will take a look at the new code to see why some modules are into core and why you won't need another modules anymore.

Then, we will do together a live demo with the last version of Drupal 8 putting focus on the most important and powerful improvements like:

New content administration
Blocks and layouts.
Configuration of content types and new fields.
Form and view display.
Multilingual.
Configuration management.

usually do really great which is just

00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:56,820

do a live demo or whatever so let's

00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:41,869
start

00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:50,439
so as you can see this is the new

00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:52,619
toolbar of Drupal 8 is pretty nice you

00:01:50,439 --> 00:01:56,640

00:01:52,619 --> 00:02:00,970
you have of course all the typical links

00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:04,240
display most with these chips new you

00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:09,580
can move again your toolbar and it's

00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:12,519
fully responsive as you can see and of

00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:14,500
course the administration's pages are

00:02:12,519 --> 00:02:18,810
also responsive like in the latest

00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:18,810

now because you will see that we have a

00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:42,650
new administration page with a part of a

00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:44,810
specific for your custom blocks and it's

00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:47,870

yeah we have it there so we actually

00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:05,700
included the block twice and we will

00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:08,130

00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:14,850

00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:32,229
the current eyes yeah we have a new

00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:34,810
entity which is common types so actually

00:05:32,229 --> 00:05:37,900
you will be able to create new content

00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:40,630
types for your content new common type

00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:45,280
sorry for your content types so let's

00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:47,380
create one why not it's really easy as

00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:49,449
you can see the target entity is to

00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:52,350
check if you are going to include a

00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:56,710
comment in a content in a taxonomy or

00:05:52,350 --> 00:06:03,669
whatever so here we have our comment

00:05:56,710 --> 00:06:07,030
let's add some fields for them so in

00:06:03,669 --> 00:06:09,160
that case I just put an email you can

00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:11,350
see here the new fields which have bad

00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:17,889
part of the core of Drupal 7 of the

00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:25,330
ballot sorry so yeah we actually added a

00:06:17,889 --> 00:06:29,050
new field and we will check now in the

00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:31,960
configuration of the form of the common

00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:36,430
types actually you will be able to

00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:39,370
manage the form of every content type or

00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:43,240
every entity and also that a managed the

00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:49,539
display like usual so as you can see we

00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:51,280
can change the form and it's working

00:06:49,539 --> 00:06:54,060
pretty well of course because Triple A

00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,060
it is awesome

00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:02,330
ok

00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:18,780
let's check now how is creating a new

00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:22,080
content type so in that case is the same

00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:25,680
page that you can find in 2.7 but with

00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:29,430
one or two improvements so let's create

00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:31,740
for example our city this stuff is the

00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:35,460
same that you can usually find the

00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:37,110
Interpol 7 so no changes here now we

00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:40,320
have our content type we will add some

00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:42,930
fields so you will be able to check data

00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:45,450
emails link volumes or whatever you want

00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:49,980
it is really new you will be able to add

00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:55,110
in reference including blogs abused and

00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:59,550
all the staff so here i am i creating a

00:07:55,110 --> 00:08:05,640
picture field which is pretty similar

00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:08,550
that on drupal 7 so let's pre regret it

00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:17,880
let's see okay station are okay let's

00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:20,520
put a directory and save it okay now we

00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:25,830
are going to add the common type that we

00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:28,260
create it and also a custom block so to

00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:30,110
include your common type the only thing

00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:33,419
that you have to choose these comments

00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:35,789
in the fields select the common type

00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:39,839
that you already created which is really

00:08:35,789 --> 00:08:41,940
easy and here you will find the

00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:44,700
configuration of your comments if it's

00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:51,000
open close hidden how many comments per

00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:54,450
page optional require it so here we have

00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:57,270
our comment and let's add now a custom

00:08:54,450 --> 00:09:03,089
blog so Fred costume blows you have to

00:08:57,270 --> 00:09:05,300
go to reference others put your name of

00:09:03,089 --> 00:09:05,300
gene

00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:15,529
maybe you want to add your custom block

00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:19,260
twice in this case is only one and here

00:09:15,529 --> 00:09:21,540
you can find well you can find your

00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:25,080
custom the configuration of your costume

00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:27,630
block is here and in the content type

00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:30,870
you have also the possibility to change

00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:34,310
the form display of your content where

00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:39,209
you are going to create a new node and

00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:45,120
you also as usual you can change a

00:09:39,209 --> 00:09:47,190
managed display of the of the content so

00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:49,670
I just made some changes just to show

00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:55,320
you that through palette is working well

00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:58,070
let's clicking save voila here is your

00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:58,070
content ID

00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:15,230
sorry now that we have our content type

00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:17,390
let's create an old I'm from Catherine's

00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:19,610
is so silly here from space so I is

00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:23,240
obviously that I'm going to create note

00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:25,670
which is Casa days here you can find a

00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:28,340
new view just to show the files that you

00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:31,400
add it in your content which is really

00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:34,850
nice so let's create a city as i told

00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:38,320
you it will be Catherine's here you can

00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:42,070
find some nice information about my city

00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:46,310
and of course let's add some previews

00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:48,470
about my porn town so this is the plaza

00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:54,020
mayor of Catherine's you will see it in

00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:55,910
a while so one of the most improvement

00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:59,000
on Triple Eight is that by adding

00:10:55,910 --> 00:11:02,090
pictures images in the body it's

00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,710
completely responsive so you will be

00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:05,360
able to see it in a minute but it's

00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:09,800
working really nice it's a huge

00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:14,570
improvement let's put an alternative

00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:20,720
taste which is now mandatory and this is

00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:22,970
all custom block so here we go we have

00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:29,530
here and you know which is Catherine's

00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:29,530
so check now the responsive yeah

00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:41,190
he is working so one of the of the most

00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:43,050
improvement to of Drupal 8 is that you

00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:46,110
have a functionality which is quick at

00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:50,100
it you will be able to edit your note in

00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:52,320
the public face of your website and the

00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:54,420
WYSIWYG is now included in the core so

00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:58,620
which you will have all the all the

00:11:54,420 --> 00:12:00,870
bottoms here in the public part so what

00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:03,750
i'm doing here is to change one picture

00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:06,290
for another i know it's a risk but i'm

00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:10,380
pretty sure that is going to work with

00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:16,260
so this is another photo of the amazing

00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:19,649
platform idea of Catherine's let's put

00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:24,870
it in the center okay just clicking in

00:12:19,649 --> 00:12:26,699
safe you have your note ready and now

00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:35,820
let's check if the comments are working

00:12:26,699 --> 00:12:38,570
well so high castes greeting from

00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:54,300
as you can see the look and feel of the

00:12:49,709 --> 00:12:57,800
Commons is really nice and yeah we have

00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:57,800
here our new content

00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:13,759
multilingual I'm not going to talk too

00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:18,860
much about the multilingual because

00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:20,600
there is another session just with the

00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:26,449
main improvement of multilingual I

00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:29,120
recommend you to attend so mm what we

00:13:26,449 --> 00:13:32,180
are doing here this is the new page of

00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:34,370
the modules finally we have a search to

00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:39,079
check if your model is inside it or not

00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:42,170
an old esta horrible so multilingual is

00:13:39,079 --> 00:13:46,490
just four modules now is not a lot too

00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:50,860
much and you can configure here or in

00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:53,689
the configuration page one of the big

00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:56,059
amazing scenes is the tours of the

00:13:53,689 --> 00:13:57,319
modules as far as i know is solely on

00:13:56,059 --> 00:14:03,019
multilingual but i'm pretty sure that

00:13:57,319 --> 00:14:06,579
you will find it in other modules so so

00:14:03,019 --> 00:14:10,720
as you can see no more read TST more and

00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:10,720
yeah it's working really well

00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:18,810
I would like to talk a little bit about

00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:21,690
the configuration management before to

00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:23,490
just show you the video so the

00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:26,070
configuration management is a huge

00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:27,449
improve is working really well now but

00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:30,899
you have to take into account that is

00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:34,370
slowly working when you have a instance

00:14:30,899 --> 00:14:37,949
of the same Drupal 8 so troopa late now

00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:40,709
has an ID which is like an identity card

00:14:37,949 --> 00:14:42,630
of your website so you will be able to

00:14:40,709 --> 00:14:44,910
use the configuration management between

00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:48,570
triple Eight's that have the same

00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:51,420
identity card so if you have to move

00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:55,320
some functionality wherever you need

00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:57,839
maybe some configuration and between

00:14:55,320 --> 00:15:00,470
Drupal 8 that they don't have the same

00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:02,970
identity card you have to use features

00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:05,670
features is working pretty well now and

00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:07,829
super late and they cessation after that

00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:10,889
one that I recommend you to go because

00:15:07,829 --> 00:15:12,329
it's going to be awesome they will talk

00:15:10,889 --> 00:15:15,120
a little bit about configuration

00:15:12,329 --> 00:15:20,970
management but they will talk also about

00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:25,260
features so it could be great so what we

00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:29,610
are going to do is I have two instance

00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:32,310
of the same Drupal 8 as you have seen I

00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:35,519
create a content type I created a blog

00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:38,310
and i created a common time I command

00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:40,740
type so what we are going to do is just

00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:45,240
to move all this stuff to another

00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:47,720
instance of Drupal 8 so let's see if

00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,720
it's working

00:15:52,949 --> 00:16:02,079
so the configuration management is the

00:15:55,509 --> 00:16:05,620
configuration page you can just import

00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:08,439
export all your configuration or you can

00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:11,319
use the single expert to a import or

00:16:08,439 --> 00:16:13,870
export what you want so you will find

00:16:11,319 --> 00:16:20,259
here a lot of functionality that you can

00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:22,629
move I feels views as I said blogs all

00:16:20,259 --> 00:16:24,100
your content types actually the

00:16:22,629 --> 00:16:26,829
configuration of your modules you can

00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:28,509
move it to so what i'm doing here is

00:16:26,829 --> 00:16:32,230
just to make a next part of my

00:16:28,509 --> 00:16:35,620
configuration and this is my another

00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:40,829
instance of Drupal 8 second instance is

00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:44,399
not too fancy but it's working okay so

00:16:40,829 --> 00:16:44,399
let's import it

00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:58,980
yeah here I made a mistake is not

00:16:53,430 --> 00:17:02,399
download sorry you don't have to touch

00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:03,839
the file you can just import the tar TC

00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:05,839
and it's working well so here in this

00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:09,559
page you can see all the difference

00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:13,319
which are part of the call and the new

00:17:09,559 --> 00:17:15,480
entities that I created and just

00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:18,449
clicking in one you can see what is

00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:21,600
changing in this case I'm showing a new

00:17:18,449 --> 00:17:25,020
one first let's check for example the

00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:27,839
name of our site and you will see

00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:30,570
perfectly that is Drupal actually so in

00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:32,700
your exchange so here my name was second

00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:37,710
instance and now it's only through

00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:42,870
polite let's import is going to take a

00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:44,670
while so I'm very sorry because actually

00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:47,480
we are moving a lot of a staff from one

00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:47,480
too polite to other

00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:05,870
and you will not need any more the

00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:09,170
typical paper where you are taking notes

00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:13,340
I change the site name and change the

00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:15,320
email i create a blog and it has these

00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:16,700
on these and i create a content type

00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:20,470
with these fields with this

00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:27,730
configuration of every field so yeah

00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:27,730
it's even better of course 50 persons

00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:39,830
yeah so let's check you will see so you

00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:42,230
will be able to find the new content

00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:44,300
type with the fields with the same

00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:49,220
configuration that if we put in the

00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:51,800
other one in the other Drupal 8 yep it's

00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:58,180
the city that we created let's check if

00:18:51,800 --> 00:19:01,100
the common type is there yeah is there

00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:02,630
so actually is working pretty well the

00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:04,990
configuration management is a huge

00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:04,990
improvement

00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:20,710
and finally I will talk to you about

00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:23,860
views views are part of the core now so

00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:28,360
all abuse like for example in a user

00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:31,450
profile I'm it's part of here from 10

00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:36,390
page is also a viewed as it is enabled

00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:39,400
by default and all the administration's

00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:41,950
pages are part of the view so you will

00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:46,000
be able to change it so as you can see

00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:50,680
here you can find this stuff let's

00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:52,780
change the page of the people to check

00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:59,200
if we can maybe remove so my stuff and

00:19:52,780 --> 00:20:01,960
see if it's working in Drupal 8 so you

00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:04,900
will be able to create triplicate clone

00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:07,420
and change the views of your

00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:11,410
administration part and it's working

00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:17,320
really nice so now as you can see we

00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:19,270
will not have any more i am with where

00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:23,220
we will not be able to find out yourself

00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:23,220
a role yeah

00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:38,450
so basically as you can see Triple A is

00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:42,020
going to be pretty awesome I think that

00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:44,450
I was really fast so now we have like 25

00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:50,150
minutes just for a question should i be

00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:53,390
as scared ok before of the questions i

00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:57,100
just wanted to show you that i put here

00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:59,060
oh sorry i put here some resources is

00:20:57,100 --> 00:21:00,910
really good at stuff is some

00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:03,560
recommendations about side building

00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:06,110
about south building in general about

00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:09,800
site building just interpolate and of

00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:11,630
course some best practice to work

00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:13,130
properly and to do a very huge

00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:16,550
configuration and very stable

00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:19,420
configuration and now if you want we can

00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:22,130
start with your questions i have already

00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:25,610
prepared my drupal 8 so maybe if you

00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:33,260
want we can check something in the in

00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:35,060
the environment I don't know yeah wait a

00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:40,820
minute because I think that we have some

00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:43,610
microphone for you hello do we have a

00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:46,120
microphone for the questions I to the

00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:46,120
minute okay

00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:55,740
my question is about configuration

00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:59,430
management you said that you you need

00:21:55,740 --> 00:22:03,960
the same idea Zack identity card between

00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:08,790
two two by two what do you mean so now

00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:11,910
when you just install a super late you

00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:15,690
will find an ID which is part of your

00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:18,090
side obviously you can change it hugging

00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:22,890
with grass I can show you if you want

00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:26,550
but actually what you have to do is so

00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:29,310
let's put an example let's imagine that

00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:32,340
Europe you are now working in a chopper

00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:35,760
a project so obviously you will work

00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:38,700
maybe nothing so maybe you are two

00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:41,310
people working so you will you will be

00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:45,270
sure that you have the same instance of

00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:49,650
the triple-eight so what I usually do is

00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:52,740
just deploy a tuple eight copy code and

00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:57,000
copy database and put it in another

00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:59,790
environment so you will be sure that you

00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:03,510
will have the same ID in this in the to

00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:05,580
Drupal 8 if you don't do it you will

00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:07,590
export your configuration on one triple

00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:09,900
eight you will try to import in another

00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:12,450
triple eight and it's going to be it's

00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:16,110
going to be fail it it's not going to be

00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:19,200
work so to Pilate will say to you oh you

00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:22,740
are not my instant you are not my twin

00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:25,050
you see so it's by default when you when

00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:28,580
you install a triple eight you will have

00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:28,580
your identity card

00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:38,350
any other question come on I have a

00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:45,410
sloop I'd already prepared for you you

00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:48,230
are not curious to see no okay anyway I

00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:51,010
will be just around yeah I have a

00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:53,630
question you said Drupal will serve

00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:55,760
responsive images and the contents yeah

00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:57,320
but is it just removing the width and

00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:59,690
height attributes of actually serving

00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:01,370
different images yeah it's working by

00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:03,800
default with all the pictures or images

00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:05,450
that you so you so you create different

00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:07,970
instances of images you look very

00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:15,370
high-rez eventually image is a new

00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:15,370
entity I can show you please

00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:24,910
you have to wait a while because I have

00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:24,910
to learn to my virtual machine

00:24:31,059 --> 00:24:40,870
so actually you can find images date as

00:24:34,899 --> 00:24:46,320
I told Poland links telephone as a field

00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:46,320
but the images are an entity

00:26:04,610 --> 00:26:16,290
so just to show you the image I'm going

00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:20,190
to add just a field in the basic page as

00:26:16,290 --> 00:26:24,420
you see he's just a reference so it's

00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:26,850
means that its identity okay so every

00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:32,730
image that you will put in in troopa

00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:38,460
will be responsive by default ok any

00:26:32,730 --> 00:26:40,820
other questions yes and the module

00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:44,280
displays sweet will that still be

00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:53,880
necessary in Drupal 8 for creating few

00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:56,970
modes by default so as I mentioned you

00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:59,280
will have to kind of display and so you

00:26:56,970 --> 00:27:03,420
will have formed and you will have the

00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:05,730
typical view mode I you asked me about

00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:08,040
this pretty sweet yeah if it's still

00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:10,050
going to be necessary nice actually you

00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:17,960
don't know I don't know if anybody in

00:27:10,050 --> 00:27:17,960
this room know something yeah okay

00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:40,660
so another huge improvement thank you so

00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:42,370
he told that this place wheat is already

00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:46,120
on top a late and it's working really

00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:56,020
well so you can just use it and it's

00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:59,380
nice anybody else yeah I was curious

00:27:56,020 --> 00:28:03,190
about features and exporting and dealing

00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:05,610
with conflicts in features well I think

00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:09,180
that you should go to the future session

00:28:05,610 --> 00:28:12,520
and maybe you can ask there and sage I

00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:19,030
want to see it make a lifetime they will

00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:21,610
be a-scared another nasty question then

00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:25,360
you showed how the contact form works

00:28:21,610 --> 00:28:27,700
nowadays in Drupal 8 because you can

00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:30,400
create your own contact form i guess now

00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:32,460
with your own fields in there so you

00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:35,380
would get a kind of a webform

00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:39,670
functionality interpolate yeah so we can

00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:42,220
stop using web form from I think that

00:28:39,670 --> 00:28:44,920
it's a part of the call okay but you can

00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:48,160
make your own content forum yeah right

00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:49,810
contact form in with your own fields

00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:52,480
yeah could you show a little bit of that

00:28:49,810 --> 00:28:54,690
uh yeah sure I never really but let's

00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,690
see

00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:31,800
okay I never check it this contact okay

00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:35,680
let's check first a configuration yeah

00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:39,130
okay so we have here yeah the typical

00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:41,370
personal contact form let's add a new

00:29:39,130 --> 00:29:41,370
one

00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:17,020
ok so is here let's take a look yeah

00:30:25,149 --> 00:30:29,070
let me check if it's working first

00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:44,280
well obviously it's not going to send my

00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:44,280
my email

00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:58,840
so yeah you can add fields of course

00:30:55,570 --> 00:31:01,630
managed the firm display manage the

00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:03,940
public display that will translate it

00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:11,290
and on the staff so you want me to add

00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:18,790
some fears that is what we yeah okay any

00:31:11,290 --> 00:31:22,000
other questions yeah what about the

00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:26,860
media management it's more simple than

00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:29,740
in Drupal 7 so your question is very

00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:34,660
general so you are talking about how to

00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:39,850
group maybe youtube videos or that kind

00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:43,030
of things it's about the mid-east is the

00:31:39,850 --> 00:31:44,950
media management include in the no no

00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:47,980
it's not included but i think that is

00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:52,930
being migrated to drupal 8 and i think

00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:55,510
that is a they have a good app and so if

00:31:52,930 --> 00:31:57,700
you want we can try to install but it

00:31:55,510 --> 00:32:00,190
for me it's okay it's not part of course

00:31:57,700 --> 00:32:08,410
if you want you we can check together

00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:12,400
what is part of the corner yes so I'm

00:32:08,410 --> 00:32:17,550
just going to scroll down to see blogs
