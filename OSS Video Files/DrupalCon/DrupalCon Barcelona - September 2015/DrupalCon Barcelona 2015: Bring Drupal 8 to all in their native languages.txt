Title: DrupalCon Barcelona 2015: Bring Drupal 8 to all in their native languages
Publication date: 2015-09-22
Playlist: DrupalCon Barcelona - September 2015
Description: 
	Localize.drupal.org has long been the central hub for translating Drupal core and its modules, themes and distributions. In this session, we'll discuss how the site supports Drupal 8 (and where its lacking) as well as best practices for translation teams to organize the work on Drupal 8 and its contributed projects.

With the outstanding feature improvements in Drupal 8 for foreign language and multilingual sites, we hope the interest in translating Drupal software to foreign languages will increase significantly. The second part of this session will discuss improvements possible to bring the localization hub to the next level to support team requirements and future needs better. The localization site is at most a community effort, so contributions are required to make changes happen. I hope some of you walk away with a renewed enthusiasm for the site and its possibilities.
