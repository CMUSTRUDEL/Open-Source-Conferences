Title: DrupalCon Barcelona 2015: Bring Drupal 8 to all in their native languages
Publication date: 2015-09-22
Playlist: DrupalCon Barcelona - September 2015
Description: 
	Localize.drupal.org has long been the central hub for translating Drupal core and its modules, themes and distributions. In this session, we'll discuss how the site supports Drupal 8 (and where its lacking) as well as best practices for translation teams to organize the work on Drupal 8 and its contributed projects.

With the outstanding feature improvements in Drupal 8 for foreign language and multilingual sites, we hope the interest in translating Drupal software to foreign languages will increase significantly. The second part of this session will discuss improvements possible to bring the localization hub to the next level to support team requirements and future needs better. The localization site is at most a community effort, so contributions are required to make changes happen. I hope some of you walk away with a renewed enthusiasm for the site and its possibilities.

I will be assisted by cab or which is a

00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:27,729
master of localization first of all this

00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:33,940
station is about localization also known

00:06:27,729 --> 00:06:40,690
as l10n don't be mistaken for internal

00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:42,990
internal generalization AKA I 18 this

00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:45,850
this this session will be about

00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:48,880
translating the interface of Drupal and

00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:51,160
it's module and we will present the

00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:54,360
current infrastructure and process

00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:58,389
process of translating where we are

00:06:54,360 --> 00:07:01,389
about the Drupal 8 support and how to

00:06:58,389 --> 00:07:04,150
make the work of translators easier and

00:07:01,389 --> 00:07:07,270
more recognized so if you want to know

00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:09,880
about internationalization there will be

00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:15,130
a multilingual session with Guevara also

00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:21,520
mvj and that will happen at 14 today

00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:26,590
room 117 okay so localization does it

00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:29,680
work the it all started with the T

00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:34,630
function this this T function is in

00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:39,729
Drupal since for a long time it can

00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:42,760
accept variables and contacts and this T

00:07:39,729 --> 00:07:44,800
function is extracted the strings using

00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:48,960
key function are extracted from Drupal

00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:53,289
and its modules using publix module and

00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:59,860
they are extracting extracted by the

00:07:53,289 --> 00:08:02,950
site localized a triple dog so this pure

00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:05,620
source files can be translated for many

00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:08,650
language by many languages and

00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:12,550
by translation groups on the localized

00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:17,320
and also on originally on the POA edit

00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:19,810
which is a desktop app app or maybe on

00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:23,320
other sites that you localize the base

00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:25,540
which is an online tool and it's really

00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:28,780
nice the interface is really nice maybe

00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:33,070
I'll do modes and also translated it can

00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:35,890
be imported back in trouble so these

00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:38,289
strings are in your installation in the

00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:43,510
two tables local sources and local

00:08:38,289 --> 00:08:45,670
targets and and another option is of

00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:47,890
course to use the localization client

00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:52,779
module to directly edit the translation

00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:55,330
on your site so these are apps to

00:08:52,779 --> 00:08:58,390
translate but we are community so we

00:08:55,330 --> 00:09:00,130
have localized at drupal.org and the top

00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:05,230
at this talk will be most about this

00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:09,279
site this site is a combination of few

00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:11,350
modules there is a paw text module that

00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:13,420
extract the swings from the release of

00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:17,470
Drupal dog they are automatically

00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:20,820
imported and it offers a tool far more

00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:23,980
performant that that than desktop apps

00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:27,100
like your cross release translation so

00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:32,650
we have pollination between the project

00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:36,220
and releases we have multiple groups for

00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:39,550
translating multiple languages this

00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:44,800
group in this group we have rose and our

00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:47,500
reviewers contributors and admins and

00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:49,560
then we can automate from that we can

00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:52,480
build a search process that

00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:56,320
automatically updates drupal translation

00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:58,900
and contribute inside your site and it

00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:03,420
is now in Drupal 8 core thanks to gaba

00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:06,339
render is a fellow farrakhan countries

00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:09,010
so i'm going to present you the process

00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:12,279
the whole process with the module used

00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:15,930
in localized to topple the COG how many

00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:17,920
of you know how the inside of the sides

00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:22,640
clockwise the tuple

00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:26,450
okay few of you the whole process begin

00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:29,360
with Drupal de dog from that from there

00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:32,450
we will pick up a release that tsv so

00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:35,660
it's a large it's like four megabytes of

00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:39,220
all the releases that are on drupal.org

00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:44,230
for all the projects we pass it and we

00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:46,910
retake the latest releases through the

00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:50,900
localization server connector which is a

00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:53,690
rest connector from that we keep the

00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:56,660
files and we analyze them with perixx

00:10:53,690 --> 00:11:02,230
module so polished is used to extract

00:10:56,660 --> 00:11:05,420
the strings and so the strings are

00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:08,390
stored in the in the huge database that

00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:11,180
is localized on drupal.org and then

00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:13,580
through the localization community

00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:17,029
modules and localization groups which is

00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:22,430
relying on oh gee the community can

00:11:17,029 --> 00:11:23,839
translate all the strings so the

00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:25,910
community can translate all those

00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:28,130
strings through the interface the

00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:30,950
interface is provided by by a

00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:34,160
localization community so when you go

00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:36,200
onto the localized of the polar oxide

00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:39,170
you can see an interface with a lot of

00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:41,030
of rows for each string and this is

00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:45,020
localization community module that

00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:48,410
provides in interface and then you have

00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:50,930
multiples a way to submit translation

00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:55,310
you have localization remote that is

00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:58,760
part of a dog lies and then it

00:11:55,310 --> 00:12:01,400
communicates with the few localization

00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:03,920
clients that you can put on your site so

00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:07,160
you are both translating your site and

00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:10,010
then submitting the translation to the

00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:12,260
localized server so you give to the

00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:15,410
community without even knowing it so

00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:17,600
it's really nice and then it gets

00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:20,720
submitted the reviewers of your group

00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:26,260
your translation group can can review

00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:30,140
your your suggestion and then we have

00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:31,520
localization packager that extract for

00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:34,970
each language

00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:39,830
p 0 files and make it makes it available

00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:42,620
on the ftp drupal.org and then from then

00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:46,310
you have the bottle is a shin a date

00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:49,100
module or Drupal 8 core then gap that

00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:54,290
can fetch these translations back to

00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:58,460
your site okay so this this is the whole

00:12:54,290 --> 00:13:03,380
process of localizing any questions on

00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:06,200
this one is a clear okay if it's clear I

00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:10,900
think we will make it we will put the

00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:14,660
chicken the schema on localize because

00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:16,760
every now then somebody asked how does

00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:19,420
it work and there there are like

00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:22,400
paddocks a localization server

00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:24,950
localization clients localization a bit

00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:29,810
on our Triple Eight it's four modules

00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:35,200
just for just for translating so okay

00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:38,060
and the great news is that in August

00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:41,270
localized with Drupal dog that was on

00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:45,380
doll sex for longer it was created in

00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:47,840
the Drupal 6 I think so the issue for

00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:51,950
porting localized eau de bolotoff was

00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:57,170
created for long ago and then sex thanks

00:13:51,950 --> 00:14:00,710
i learnt to these people many thanks to

00:13:57,170 --> 00:14:04,370
them it is now d7 power so we can now

00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:07,820
accept feature requests and and work on

00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:10,100
these features and of course the second

00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:12,320
great news is too polite corner ships

00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:15,800
with automatic downloads of Korra and

00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:18,460
controls even during insult and this

00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:24,050
will hopefully attract more

00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:31,460
international users of triple okay now

00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:34,430
some numbers scary numbers so you may

00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:37,090
not know that but localize is a one of

00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:40,610
the biggest site in terms of data

00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:43,600
because we are handling a lot of string

00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:46,370
lot of projects and

00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:49,460
for example we have a hundred and twelve

00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:52,490
translation group takes thousand

00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:54,590
contributors and counting 1 million

00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:56,870
translation recorded so they are get

00:14:54,590 --> 00:15:00,590
back in the in the database as of now

00:14:56,870 --> 00:15:05,450
and of course there are a lot of work to

00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:09,920
do as of translations like reviewing

00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:14,350
suggestions and and so on so for the

00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:18,920
developer well we have a huge database

00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:24,560
the that is six gigabytes and about half

00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:29,570
of this is the database is a is a

00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:32,240
localization related so so for example

00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:36,080
we have eight million lights just too

00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:38,960
far to match the file that where the

00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:42,800
chief function was a was analyzed the

00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:46,070
line the type i think it's suggestion of

00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:49,130
translation and the project and oh

00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:56,900
really so just these dis columns are

00:15:49,130 --> 00:16:01,370
making eight million rooms okay so from

00:15:56,900 --> 00:16:08,480
that our current status for the whole

00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:10,840
suit suite is as is so perixx module the

00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:13,520
Drupal 8 compatibility that is the

00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:16,310
capacity of extracting strings from

00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:19,070
Drupal 8 is nearly done there are three

00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:22,280
issues remaining maybe if you now

00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:26,330
because yesterday we were spending on

00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:29,750
this two of them are criticals that

00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:33,290
means the strings won't get extracted if

00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:36,800
there are not resolved some strings

00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:39,200
won't get extracted so the first one is

00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:42,170
support for Drupal 8 configuration

00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:45,920
translate all so we have a few issues

00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:49,460
with a country module that are depending

00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:53,360
on the other configuration dependencies

00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:55,660
and then external dependencies and then

00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:58,210
we have recently

00:16:55,660 --> 00:17:00,850
in the translation wrapper class 2

00:16:58,210 --> 00:17:04,030
translated all three strings string and

00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:06,370
the issue is quite resolved I think well

00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:10,140
actually I committed this morning nice

00:17:06,370 --> 00:17:13,540
not much just by me by harem so cool and

00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:17,260
then the minor one on the format's of ya

00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:21,910
mola translation patterns so we are

00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:24,520
pretty good on products the next I think

00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:28,150
the next thing thing will be to port the

00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:31,630
buttocks module so that Drupal 8 sites

00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:33,280
can extract themselves yes so right now

00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:35,350
the problem is if you want to look at

00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:37,300
your if you want to check your source

00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:39,400
code if all the things you think are

00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:41,830
translatable are actually translatable

00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:44,920
on your Drupal 8 site you now need to

00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:46,630
have a Drupal 7 drush install so you can

00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:49,140
actually run pio TX on your Drupal 8

00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:52,330
code which is not very convenient

00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:54,460
especially since Bo TX is pretty version

00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:56,560
independent so we could make it work

00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:59,920
with Drupal 8 but we need to port some

00:17:56,560 --> 00:18:01,990
stuff to do blade so you can use Bo TX

00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:07,480
to verify that your code is ready for

00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:10,390
translation into play okay so now for

00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:13,330
the localization update parts it's all

00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:18,790
good we are now we have not the capacity

00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:21,490
to add a translation in Drupal 8 core so

00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:24,340
mean why the interface of Drupal 8 core

00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:31,360
has been back posted to a new Drupal 7

00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:35,370
to branch and that's yet as for

00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:40,090
localization clients we we don't have a

00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:43,180
version for Drupal 8 yet we have a new

00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:47,290
proof of concept made by gov or n sorry

00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:50,590
I Kevin Audrey we have an early okay so

00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:53,980
it's based on the tour module I'm going

00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:56,650
to show you a quick demo the main issues

00:18:53,980 --> 00:19:00,520
of this proof-of-concept are its power

00:18:56,650 --> 00:19:04,650
off in terms of the d8 API I managed to

00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:07,520
to install it on the last beta 15 but

00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:10,760
maybe some DX

00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:13,430
Jiggs things have changed yeah so the so

00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:15,860
the idea with with the concept is people

00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:18,590
always wanted to do in place translation

00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:20,720
of things on the page but Drupal outputs

00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:22,730
things at all kinds of places on the

00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:25,520
page that you cannot really in place at

00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:27,470
it so the idea with this proof of

00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:30,470
concept is to use something like the

00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:31,940
tour module two point two places where

00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:33,560
you have things that you can translate

00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:36,410
and then you can in place translate them

00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:38,590
there and then the rest of the things

00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:41,810
that may contain dynamic information

00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:44,300
that we cannot find on the page could be

00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:46,070
shown at the end in a summary and then

00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:47,750
you can translate the rest at the end of

00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:49,610
the process so you can kind of get an

00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:52,220
in-place translation experience on the

00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:54,350
page is not very scalable if you start

00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:56,720
off fresh translating a page because

00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:58,850
then like you have hundreds of strings

00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:00,230
on a page and an input field jumping

00:19:58,850 --> 00:20:03,260
around on the page that you need to

00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:05,030
follow but considering that the

00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:07,220
community you should translate to

00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:09,560
several languages this is useful to

00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:11,900
touch up on things that are not yet done

00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:13,400
and using the remote submission

00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:18,980
functionally contribute to the community

00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:21,650
as well yeah so about that for example

00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:25,070
strings that I have variables in them

00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:27,920
can't be translated but you we have kind

00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:32,600
of a with full back window for that that

00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:36,350
that is new to and of course it doesn't

00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:40,820
send or save anything actually right now

00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:44,470
so it's a bit of a shame but it's a good

00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:49,670
prefer of concept and here is the demo

00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:52,430
so I've installed only localization

00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:54,320
clients in either the one long way in

00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:58,070
language and then you have a little

00:20:54,320 --> 00:21:01,730
button that the far top right on the on

00:20:58,070 --> 00:21:04,970
the navbar and as you can see the trauma

00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:08,990
jewelry is displaying some pop-ups so

00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:13,220
some of them are orbit far outside the

00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:14,980
the page and it should it should replace

00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:17,500
the text that

00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:21,220
that you are typing and then if you

00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:24,370
don't see some translation you have this

00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:28,299
fall back window that at the end at the

00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:31,360
end so that's called and you have a

00:21:28,299 --> 00:21:38,140
little percentage thing that we we don't

00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:40,540
have in Drupal 7 okay so that's so

00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:42,940
that's an idea this this is a video of

00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:45,190
actual code running on Drupal 8 but it

00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:46,750
doesn't actually save anything or it

00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:48,400
doesn't actually send it to the

00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:50,410
localization server so this is a proof

00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:53,910
of concept that we started as a cat on

00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:57,160
project and then then it it's at the

00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:59,490
waiting for someone to help finish it up

00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:59,490
state

00:22:13,810 --> 00:22:19,660
so the question was is it possible to

00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:22,000
translate something by clicking on it if

00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:25,660
it was untranslated with this

00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:29,110
proof-of-concept no but I think it like

00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:31,360
the tour module adds enough metadata on

00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:33,370
the elements that we could write some

00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:35,260
JavaScript to figure out if you clicked

00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:37,810
on something if there's an element in

00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:40,390
that area of the Dom that has the

00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:42,610
metadata and show the field I think it's

00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:48,610
possible to do you we need someone to

00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:51,340
help get this move forward we can talk

00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:53,770
to him layer see I if he has the time is

00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:55,630
like triple or quadruple booked or

00:22:53,770 --> 00:23:02,920
something I don't know on all kinds of

00:22:55,630 --> 00:23:06,370
things another question now the next

00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:10,150
step is the main parts localization

00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:12,850
Saros that is powering your local ice so

00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:17,020
now we are the Drupal 6 branch that is

00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:22,260
now discontinued okay well except for

00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:22,260
security le releases and backboards but

00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:31,630
it has a lots of interesting remaining

00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:34,150
issues regarding usability and and a

00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:37,690
whole lots of a feature request that we

00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:41,110
can port to now to a Drupal 7 which is

00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:46,110
now powering localized a triple a dog so

00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:48,880
I'm going to review some of them because

00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:52,000
there are some IDs that are really nice

00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:55,840
and maybe at the end of the talk I will

00:23:52,000 --> 00:24:01,810
ask for sure all the ends of the main

00:23:55,840 --> 00:24:06,520
ideas that you want to be put first okay

00:24:01,810 --> 00:24:08,800
so on the drupal side side it's getting

00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:12,490
better with the localization a dates and

00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:18,960
so on in Drupal 8 core but now with we

00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:22,960
are facing a more more problematic so

00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:23,840
situation the localization community

00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:28,370
want

00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:32,679
get the recognition because people that

00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:35,630
will use Drupal 8 sites will just have

00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:40,250
Drupal site that is localized and that

00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:42,650
just works so we may need to provide

00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:44,510
some gamification and statistics and

00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:50,210
badges for the community that is on

00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:52,610
localized and maybe feature some links

00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:56,360
to the localized sites during install

00:24:52,610 --> 00:25:01,309
and something like that to to keep

00:24:56,360 --> 00:25:04,250
people coming to localize the

00:25:01,309 --> 00:25:08,690
infrastructure is handling more and more

00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:11,390
strings because we regular regularly had

00:25:08,690 --> 00:25:15,289
languages we have more releases more

00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:18,279
projects and so on so first we need to

00:25:15,289 --> 00:25:23,690
archive some old data that is Drupal 5

00:25:18,279 --> 00:25:27,649
we have I think thousands of releases in

00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:29,659
Drupal 5 and this will hopefully improve

00:25:27,649 --> 00:25:33,230
our search performance and performance

00:25:29,659 --> 00:25:36,440
overall next up is a translation

00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:40,760
interface that needs a revamp right now

00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:44,690
it's a very two thousand and six or

00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:50,539
seven ish so we may need to think about

00:25:44,690 --> 00:25:53,360
the UX of the translation interface so

00:25:50,539 --> 00:25:55,700
why not translate it's not exclusively

00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:58,490
but most of the time in lateralization

00:25:55,700 --> 00:26:03,080
clients or maybe in a whole other

00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:08,419
interface through recipe a pas that's

00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:11,360
Heidi's the community aspect needs a

00:26:08,419 --> 00:26:14,720
push because even in in the groups that

00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:19,460
that Armada more and more active we have

00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:24,470
a loss of momentum due to now we are we

00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:27,110
have lost notifications through mail but

00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:30,020
we need to get it back maybe or maybe

00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:31,970
have activity streams like a hutong

00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:35,060
stellated what in the

00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:36,860
yesterday or something like that maybe

00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:42,020
more discussion about the strings

00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:44,480
themselves like glossary hauntings and

00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:46,940
maybe report back to the maintainer of a

00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:51,200
module that the string is not really

00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:54,910
easy to translate some something like

00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:58,460
that so we will discuss these problems

00:26:54,910 --> 00:27:01,420
through three examples and heidi's that

00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:05,720
I've picked up from the localized well

00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:09,410
localization server issue queue first I

00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:12,170
will I would like to show you trans

00:27:09,410 --> 00:27:16,460
effects how many of you are neutrons

00:27:12,170 --> 00:27:20,090
effects okay for the photo record is a

00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:24,080
it's a it's a site so no external sites

00:27:20,090 --> 00:27:28,030
that is a proprietary but a lot of open

00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:34,340
source project are using it for example

00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:38,090
VLC jungle own cloud and it's free for

00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:42,950
open source projects so I'm going to

00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:46,850
demo it bit quickly just the images is a

00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:49,820
blurry so it's not so nice the interface

00:27:46,850 --> 00:27:54,860
is that simple it's fast this wall

00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:56,930
search and the suggestion and history in

00:27:54,860 --> 00:28:01,000
gloss are we huddling are really really

00:27:56,930 --> 00:28:04,100
nice and it's a really a string centric

00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:07,700
and we have mass review search and

00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:12,320
replace and of course activity streams

00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:17,230
announcements statistics and so on so

00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:21,100
I'm going to demo the interface so

00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:21,100
seniors okay

00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:33,700
okay so yeah it's free for open source

00:28:30,610 --> 00:28:36,280
project and you can have as many

00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:38,620
language as you like you have some

00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:41,950
statistics on the on the front page of a

00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:44,110
project basically we are that that's

00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:49,240
what's interesting the transition

00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:54,060
interface so you import you import some

00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:58,750
peyote files that are templates of

00:28:54,060 --> 00:29:01,210
source strings and then we you have a

00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:05,230
list on the on the left that you can

00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:07,720
bulk check and review or in review you

00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:11,110
have even matching translate through

00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:15,280
google search google translate and join

00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:17,860
or Microsoft but it's paid services you

00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:23,620
have bulk find and replace that is very

00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:26,140
nice and some tiger hunting so then when

00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:30,340
you are when you click on only one

00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:33,270
string as I said it's very string some

00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:37,510
tricks so we you have the untranslated

00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:40,180
untranslated string which on it you can

00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:42,880
add instructions about the strings like

00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:47,320
don't don't touch this this is a frozen

00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:51,100
for example you can add your your own

00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:53,710
suggestion and save it and then you have

00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:56,650
a bunch of tabs that add details about

00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:58,900
the drink so you have the occurrence of

00:29:56,650 --> 00:30:02,920
the strings in the in the files of your

00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:07,240
project and you have all the suggestion

00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:11,340
that everyone has made none yet history

00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:14,410
about the strings and a little of this

00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:17,370
little thing is really nice the glossary

00:30:14,410 --> 00:30:24,930
I will talk about this later and

00:30:17,370 --> 00:30:24,930
commands okay so this is a critical demo

00:30:27,309 --> 00:30:35,419
so we well we could ask the question of

00:30:31,959 --> 00:30:39,649
porting it to putting the whole thing to

00:30:35,419 --> 00:30:44,109
trans effects but it has api's and so on

00:30:39,649 --> 00:30:46,489
but the work that we've put two to make

00:30:44,109 --> 00:30:51,079
localize and rupa da dog walk together

00:30:46,489 --> 00:30:53,899
are it would be a bit of a shame to not

00:30:51,079 --> 00:30:57,219
have everything in one place and one

00:30:53,899 --> 00:31:00,319
place that we know we can unroll and all

00:30:57,219 --> 00:31:05,089
and then maybe later at badges in on

00:31:00,319 --> 00:31:09,529
drupal.org for translators and so on so

00:31:05,089 --> 00:31:14,899
I report the question to to the end of

00:31:09,529 --> 00:31:18,049
the session about that so we just we

00:31:14,899 --> 00:31:21,799
just saw glossary section on trans

00:31:18,049 --> 00:31:23,899
effects actually I am part of the French

00:31:21,799 --> 00:31:26,749
community and we have a French side it's

00:31:23,899 --> 00:31:34,129
a whole external site that I and high

00:31:26,749 --> 00:31:37,519
and a colleague of mine manage so it's

00:31:34,129 --> 00:31:41,869
an external Drupal 7 sides we have a

00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:46,569
content type that is a glossary term so

00:31:41,869 --> 00:31:51,769
as of as in localized we have a source

00:31:46,569 --> 00:31:55,129
source string sorry which is legacy for

00:31:51,769 --> 00:31:59,449
on this example and then anyone can put

00:31:55,129 --> 00:32:02,089
is its suggestion and everyone can vote

00:31:59,449 --> 00:32:05,749
on this suggestion and then it gets

00:32:02,089 --> 00:32:08,719
extracted two adjacent file we have we

00:32:05,749 --> 00:32:16,819
have some some browser extensions that

00:32:08,719 --> 00:32:18,739
that's our available here sorry so this

00:32:16,819 --> 00:32:23,079
is the site and we have browser

00:32:18,739 --> 00:32:28,639
extensions for Firefox Safari and chrome

00:32:23,079 --> 00:32:32,599
so we have like 400 the strings I think

00:32:28,639 --> 00:32:35,149
and some of them are statues of other

00:32:32,599 --> 00:32:38,389
statues to be reviewed and some of them

00:32:35,149 --> 00:32:38,909
are frozen so every every time someone

00:32:38,389 --> 00:32:40,889
comes

00:32:38,909 --> 00:32:45,570
want to translate we show them that

00:32:40,889 --> 00:32:49,049
there is a grocery to follow and this is

00:32:45,570 --> 00:32:54,479
really nice for the translation french

00:32:49,049 --> 00:32:56,340
translation sprints so this is really

00:32:54,479 --> 00:32:58,979
nice and we would like to put it in a

00:32:56,340 --> 00:33:03,179
directly in localized also I would like

00:32:58,979 --> 00:33:05,669
to point out that the interface of local

00:33:03,179 --> 00:33:14,609
eyes is much better to translate with

00:33:05,669 --> 00:33:17,039
the these little little highlights so

00:33:14,609 --> 00:33:19,979
these are available directly on

00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:24,629
localized em on your localization client

00:33:19,979 --> 00:33:27,239
module in your site so that so that your

00:33:24,629 --> 00:33:30,269
browser extensions integrating the

00:33:27,239 --> 00:33:32,159
terminology information from the JSON

00:33:30,269 --> 00:33:36,389
that was exported from the French side

00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:40,440
yeah so lucky so we could put it in on

00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:44,340
localize but we will lose the capacity

00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:47,099
of of having your glossary on the

00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:52,820
localization client module so maybe the

00:33:47,099 --> 00:33:56,519
browser extension should be get ok so

00:33:52,820 --> 00:34:02,090
now about performance Oh is there any

00:33:56,519 --> 00:34:02,090
question about that yeah

00:34:15,270 --> 00:34:23,650
yeah absolutely the question was what

00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:26,770
his alcoholism question but yet then we

00:34:23,650 --> 00:34:29,130
could add some roles while some

00:34:26,770 --> 00:34:34,360
permission about that in the translation

00:34:29,130 --> 00:34:38,020
group teams to to freeze this glossary

00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:43,890
and then and then everyone would be

00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:48,670
having good translation okay so now to

00:34:43,890 --> 00:34:51,490
performance so we the first thing that

00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:53,370
we absolutely need to do it right now we

00:34:51,490 --> 00:34:58,510
have triple Eight's that is coming

00:34:53,370 --> 00:35:01,270
triple five is really far so issue the

00:34:58,510 --> 00:35:05,890
archive strings and that should give us

00:35:01,270 --> 00:35:08,680
some space of course only the strings

00:35:05,890 --> 00:35:13,240
would be archived the translation files

00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:16,360
would be kept on ftp drupal the dog what

00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:18,970
we could do then is improve the

00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:22,050
interface but and performance in

00:35:18,970 --> 00:35:24,880
interface by doing more objects request

00:35:22,050 --> 00:35:28,620
because right now if you select the

00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:32,050
filter of 50 strings you get 50 rows of

00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:36,340
translations sauce sauce wings em and

00:35:32,050 --> 00:35:40,660
the suggestions and its really really

00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:46,950
slow so we could add some kind of purse

00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:52,390
string loading and saving by a jack see

00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:55,510
then we have some SQL SQL requests made

00:35:52,390 --> 00:35:59,830
for statistics that are really really

00:35:55,510 --> 00:36:06,630
slow so maybe if someone that has good

00:35:59,830 --> 00:36:09,790
SQL skill can come by and help us

00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:11,670
another ID is to index strings in other

00:36:09,790 --> 00:36:15,160
another

00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:18,880
another server solo server or elastic

00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:21,339
search server for full-text search and

00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:27,480
also for statistics it would be a lot

00:36:21,339 --> 00:36:30,190
faster and anyone can either its ID so

00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:34,380
remember it's a discussion so don't

00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:34,380
hesitate to bring bring up your IDs

00:36:35,489 --> 00:36:44,140
about the UX improvements we have a few

00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:47,559
few ideas about that the the main thing

00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:51,700
that that I get when when people are

00:36:47,559 --> 00:36:55,359
translating friendship is that we should

00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:57,299
focus only on the stable releases in

00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:59,829
your search in the search bar you have

00:36:57,299 --> 00:37:02,069
automatically we should have

00:36:59,829 --> 00:37:05,380
automatically the latest stable release

00:37:02,069 --> 00:37:07,660
selected for example so that people

00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:13,739
focus on the honorary on the strings

00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:18,789
that matters another idea is to get

00:37:13,739 --> 00:37:21,690
search for example reviewers would like

00:37:18,789 --> 00:37:26,170
to have automatically the reviewing

00:37:21,690 --> 00:37:29,140
filter on that will be great to to

00:37:26,170 --> 00:37:33,069
review a fast faster the strings of one

00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:36,989
project for example so we have this idea

00:37:33,069 --> 00:37:39,640
of visual shows which is a little

00:37:36,989 --> 00:37:43,569
jealous quick plug in that even try to

00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:47,349
affect transit X as and I didn't do that

00:37:43,569 --> 00:37:49,779
but I propose the this this one and it's

00:37:47,349 --> 00:37:52,509
the same one so there is an issue about

00:37:49,779 --> 00:37:55,359
that and I think it's true Paul seven

00:37:52,509 --> 00:37:57,999
yeah it's triple seven so it should be

00:37:55,359 --> 00:38:00,579
it should be tested a bit more before

00:37:57,999 --> 00:38:03,700
before I get getting into a localized

00:38:00,579 --> 00:38:07,690
but I think it's a nice idea and it's a

00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:10,029
nice beginning for improving UX and of

00:38:07,690 --> 00:38:13,499
course of course we have many other IDs

00:38:10,029 --> 00:38:16,089
like statistics on community activity

00:38:13,499 --> 00:38:18,280
improved newcomer experience by using

00:38:16,089 --> 00:38:21,280
the back part of

00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:26,470
or even the back part of the true module

00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:31,270
or even Joey ride to to welcome the

00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:33,490
newer translator of course comments on

00:38:31,270 --> 00:38:37,570
the suggestion and translations would be

00:38:33,490 --> 00:38:42,850
a big plus translation memory which is

00:38:37,570 --> 00:38:45,400
auto suggestions from other strings it's

00:38:42,850 --> 00:38:48,160
known as fuzzy matching when you when

00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:54,130
you have translated for example one

00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:57,250
orange to you know all of Jose we are

00:38:54,130 --> 00:39:02,560
fuzzy match with two oranges and it

00:38:57,250 --> 00:39:06,850
would be a faster for for translators we

00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:09,850
have I don't think we have the same spam

00:39:06,850 --> 00:39:13,180
prevention than on Drupal dog and it's

00:39:09,850 --> 00:39:16,420
getting getting a bit hard to fight spam

00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:20,640
so we could ask the DA to to help us

00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:23,620
about that rest report which would be a

00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:30,610
would be nice for fighting so strings in

00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:33,700
external apps for example and then we

00:39:30,610 --> 00:39:36,990
have some some other problems like

00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:40,450
language in a written some language some

00:39:36,990 --> 00:39:42,880
local language would like to turn to

00:39:40,450 --> 00:39:47,320
hinder its translation swing from the

00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:53,320
main languages like a English from UK

00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:57,040
and English from us we have we could

00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:59,710
have staging imports and bulk review in

00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:02,050
localized we could have localized the

00:39:59,710 --> 00:40:05,940
Drupal daughter that is localized so you

00:40:02,050 --> 00:40:09,010
could translate in your own language and

00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:13,660
then mark down for wiki pages and so on

00:40:09,010 --> 00:40:16,420
so it would be good I have a few fewer

00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:20,490
GL languages that that are complaining

00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:23,860
about the support of ltl languages too

00:40:20,490 --> 00:40:26,440
okay thanks we like to thank our

00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:28,300
respective company aquia for gabor and

00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:33,800
Maxine are copies for

00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:40,610
for me any question or reactions about

00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:44,740
that feel free to use a mic if you don't

00:40:40,610 --> 00:40:50,450
let let's print hole all week on that

00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:53,960
especially on Friday yeah yeah sure use

00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:57,140
it one question regarding and trance

00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:59,030
effects so that is to have similar kind

00:40:57,140 --> 00:41:00,890
of theatres in localized up a lot or

00:40:59,030 --> 00:41:03,980
actually use transifex because its

00:41:00,890 --> 00:41:06,770
proprietary software yeah now the thing

00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:09,620
is we would like to put some features

00:41:06,770 --> 00:41:11,870
out of trans effect in to localize dr.

00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:14,870
Paulo actually we we are only missing

00:41:11,870 --> 00:41:17,240
like they have good status in statistics

00:41:14,870 --> 00:41:19,010
and activity fit and come on some

00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:21,170
strings and glossary of course but

00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:25,460
glossary I think it would be really fast

00:41:21,170 --> 00:41:28,220
to integrate so we are we have like you

00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:31,960
have seventy or eighty percent of trans

00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:31,960
effects available so it's really nice

00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:41,090
yeah consumed I can mask yeah so you

00:41:36,890 --> 00:41:44,630
mentioned a whole slew of issues what

00:41:41,090 --> 00:41:47,210
would you say the top three are in terms

00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:49,580
of priority which things would you like

00:41:47,210 --> 00:41:52,790
to focus on okay the top priority is to

00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:57,620
archive old strings and then we have

00:41:52,790 --> 00:42:01,700
some work that is done like the the

00:41:57,620 --> 00:42:03,710
visual search interface is done it's the

00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:07,580
patch is really you just have to test it

00:42:03,710 --> 00:42:10,370
so the the thing to test on localized is

00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:14,330
that you have to have drupal.org

00:42:10,370 --> 00:42:20,110
development sites to test on because you

00:42:14,330 --> 00:42:24,110
have to have real data and and this is

00:42:20,110 --> 00:42:27,020
this is not done easily to to to walk on

00:42:24,110 --> 00:42:30,760
your local development server so we

00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:33,410
prefer to to walk on drupal.org servers

00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:36,290
but it's ready to test so we have

00:42:33,410 --> 00:42:38,750
archiving triple five strings we have

00:42:36,290 --> 00:42:40,400
visual search and maybe the glossary

00:42:38,750 --> 00:42:42,650
would need to

00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:46,609
to pick up the ID maybe make it a

00:42:42,650 --> 00:42:50,450
feature and then adding for some

00:42:46,609 --> 00:42:56,950
permissions and the idea there we just

00:42:50,450 --> 00:42:56,950
have to put it down on the code thanks

00:42:58,089 --> 00:43:07,210
for performance I think there's probably

00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:12,400
some quicker wins with adding indexes to

00:43:07,210 --> 00:43:15,670
database tables and SQL type stuff so

00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:18,529
that's I'd actually put that ahead of

00:43:15,670 --> 00:43:22,270
archiving which I imagine our Titan

00:43:18,529 --> 00:43:25,849
would be a little bit harder of a task

00:43:22,270 --> 00:43:29,750
but yeah both are definitely good ideas

00:43:25,849 --> 00:43:32,809
yeah we already have some indexes but

00:43:29,750 --> 00:43:35,359
yes we should we should take every

00:43:32,809 --> 00:43:38,210
request made by the localization server

00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:42,079
module and explain petite teenie explain

00:43:38,210 --> 00:43:44,029
my scroll and yeah definitely we could

00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:46,789
add some index especially for a

00:43:44,029 --> 00:43:49,400
statistic data that are run on crone

00:43:46,789 --> 00:43:53,450
runs and maybe take an hour to refresh

00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:56,359
or something like that for some I think

00:43:53,450 --> 00:43:59,210
the main page the front page is doing

00:43:56,359 --> 00:44:01,819
there is a is taking this time to

00:43:59,210 --> 00:44:04,279
process yeah there's definitely a lot of

00:44:01,819 --> 00:44:06,410
a lot of opportunity there but we need

00:44:04,279 --> 00:44:09,500
someone with some time and some

00:44:06,410 --> 00:44:13,010
expertise and I guess so you recognize

00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:15,799
some some of that already in issues just

00:44:13,010 --> 00:44:17,569
one just one so far but I'd sure there's

00:44:15,799 --> 00:44:19,789
more I think you've found through

00:44:17,569 --> 00:44:23,410
database logs or something or how you

00:44:19,789 --> 00:44:28,910
recognize those issues yeah in general I

00:44:23,410 --> 00:44:31,190
for that one I just got a query of the

00:44:28,910 --> 00:44:36,980
process list while I was waiting for the

00:44:31,190 --> 00:44:39,920
home page to load okay but yeah we could

00:44:36,980 --> 00:44:42,890
use better tooling for like the Percona

00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:43,940
slow log monitor you could probably just

00:44:42,890 --> 00:44:46,640
all that in your home directory on the

00:44:43,940 --> 00:44:49,160
dev server room you asked that would be

00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:54,200
good yeah

00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:56,089
yeah we should talk about that more so I

00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:59,150
have a question about from a perspective

00:44:56,089 --> 00:45:01,130
of reviewers so how much statistics can

00:44:59,150 --> 00:45:03,730
we'll actually get out right now because

00:45:01,130 --> 00:45:06,140
I have no idea one translations come in

00:45:03,730 --> 00:45:09,770
we have data we have data about

00:45:06,140 --> 00:45:12,650
everything right we do not available yes

00:45:09,770 --> 00:45:15,319
we don't output the data because of our

00:45:12,650 --> 00:45:17,420
performance concerns so we have data bad

00:45:15,319 --> 00:45:19,910
like the smallest detail of everything

00:45:17,420 --> 00:45:22,280
so when somebody submits a suggestion we

00:45:19,910 --> 00:45:24,260
track when did when was it submitted who

00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:25,880
submitted it which tool they used to

00:45:24,260 --> 00:45:27,589
submitted so we can tell if it was

00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:31,309
coming from localization client or the

00:45:27,589 --> 00:45:33,980
site or something we track when it was

00:45:31,309 --> 00:45:36,710
approved by whom it was approved if it

00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:38,690
was rejected who rejected it when it was

00:45:36,710 --> 00:45:40,039
rejected if it was approved again or

00:45:38,690 --> 00:45:42,530
somebody submitted at the same thing

00:45:40,039 --> 00:45:45,079
again who was that person so we have a

00:45:42,530 --> 00:45:46,670
lot of data on everything which is part

00:45:45,079 --> 00:45:48,349
of the reason we have that huge database

00:45:46,670 --> 00:45:51,640
because we keep all that log information

00:45:48,349 --> 00:45:58,670
for each of the half a million strings

00:45:51,640 --> 00:46:00,260
and x 112 translations so we have all

00:45:58,670 --> 00:46:01,849
that data we need to figure out how to

00:46:00,260 --> 00:46:04,670
make that available we need to figure

00:46:01,849 --> 00:46:08,900
out what kind of data to people would

00:46:04,670 --> 00:46:10,910
like to see so the idea of the that

00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:14,059
Sebastian explained about activity feeds

00:46:10,910 --> 00:46:15,650
is yes now when people submit if

00:46:14,059 --> 00:46:17,809
somebody translates views in your

00:46:15,650 --> 00:46:19,579
language you have no idea they did it

00:46:17,809 --> 00:46:22,549
because you have no visibility to the

00:46:19,579 --> 00:46:25,099
data so some teams worked around that by

00:46:22,549 --> 00:46:26,869
submitting a post say I just submitted

00:46:25,099 --> 00:46:29,270
the v's translation please someone look

00:46:26,869 --> 00:46:31,579
at it it's not very nice that you need

00:46:29,270 --> 00:46:33,559
to manually do that so we I think we

00:46:31,579 --> 00:46:35,839
should have activity feeds to expose

00:46:33,559 --> 00:46:38,510
that kind of information and we actually

00:46:35,839 --> 00:46:41,210
had a google Summer of Code student try

00:46:38,510 --> 00:46:43,609
to do that two years ago but he failed

00:46:41,210 --> 00:46:44,839
to find enough time in the summer to

00:46:43,609 --> 00:46:47,720
complete it they would have been

00:46:44,839 --> 00:46:50,480
entirely capable technically but not

00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:52,250
capable in terms of time so I'm thought

00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:54,369
we had a chance there but unfortunately

00:46:52,250 --> 00:46:59,000
we haven't haven't been able to get

00:46:54,369 --> 00:47:01,309
result from there but it's a very good

00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,829
idea that we should explore so we have

00:47:01,309 --> 00:47:04,769
an issue

00:47:01,829 --> 00:47:06,930
where we have an issue that a short

00:47:04,769 --> 00:47:11,459
answer yes not a very comforting answer

00:47:06,930 --> 00:47:15,749
but yes and what could help we would be

00:47:11,459 --> 00:47:19,440
what would you want to have displayed in

00:47:15,749 --> 00:47:22,049
terms of statistics as as for me I think

00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:26,279
that we should be focusing on the latest

00:47:22,049 --> 00:47:28,920
release so we should which we should

00:47:26,279 --> 00:47:32,549
swap out the older releases that are in

00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:35,459
Ontario to this one to the stable one so

00:47:32,549 --> 00:47:38,969
if you have any ideas of how would you

00:47:35,459 --> 00:47:43,619
like to see data just passed on the on

00:47:38,969 --> 00:47:47,099
the issue it would be really nice okay

00:47:43,619 --> 00:47:49,079
thank you so first of all thank you for

00:47:47,099 --> 00:47:51,390
caring but these boring things because

00:47:49,079 --> 00:47:53,759
you rarely get probably a lot of thanks

00:47:51,390 --> 00:47:55,499
but one practical questions obviously

00:47:53,759 --> 00:47:58,259
you have quite a bit of legacy and

00:47:55,499 --> 00:48:01,319
history with this so I guess all of this

00:47:58,259 --> 00:48:03,569
is done using your own code and not

00:48:01,319 --> 00:48:07,079
Symphony components or something because

00:48:03,569 --> 00:48:09,329
so probably hard to switch but have you

00:48:07,079 --> 00:48:12,630
considered because at least in 2.7

00:48:09,329 --> 00:48:14,160
there's a translator profiler or

00:48:12,630 --> 00:48:17,279
something like that have you considered

00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:20,130
for some parts looking from some shared

00:48:17,279 --> 00:48:23,910
bits and pieces or is that is it just

00:48:20,130 --> 00:48:26,339
may be so different yeah so in Drupal 8

00:48:23,910 --> 00:48:29,579
we use a lot of symphony components and

00:48:26,339 --> 00:48:31,499
one of our one of our members of the

00:48:29,579 --> 00:48:33,269
multilingual team started working on

00:48:31,499 --> 00:48:37,069
integrating the symphony translator

00:48:33,269 --> 00:48:39,719
component Clemens toll boom in fact and

00:48:37,069 --> 00:48:41,910
he found that there's there were at the

00:48:39,719 --> 00:48:43,259
time I was I think a year and a half ago

00:48:41,910 --> 00:48:45,569
over two years ago there was a lot of

00:48:43,259 --> 00:48:49,319
missing features in symphony that we

00:48:45,569 --> 00:48:52,109
already have in core particularly can't

00:48:49,319 --> 00:48:53,759
string contacts support for providing

00:48:52,109 --> 00:48:56,789
metadata in the code about your string

00:48:53,759 --> 00:48:58,410
and he started writing code for no he

00:48:56,789 --> 00:49:00,599
started pouring the Drupal code to

00:48:58,410 --> 00:49:02,430
symphony so that they have that feature

00:49:00,599 --> 00:49:04,349
that we need to have so that seems

00:49:02,430 --> 00:49:07,019
everybody is happy in symphony and have

00:49:04,349 --> 00:49:09,089
the feature but turns out you cannot

00:49:07,019 --> 00:49:11,519
port a feature from Drupal because

00:49:09,089 --> 00:49:13,199
drupal's GPL and symphony the license is

00:49:11,519 --> 00:49:14,230
not compatible so you can adjust copy

00:49:13,199 --> 00:49:16,060
over the code you need

00:49:14,230 --> 00:49:17,980
to rewrite the code entirely for

00:49:16,060 --> 00:49:21,160
symphony so it's not copied over from

00:49:17,980 --> 00:49:23,290
Drupal's GPL code so license was not

00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:27,160
compatible and he spent a lot of time

00:49:23,290 --> 00:49:30,850
trying to convince people there to that

00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:33,070
they need that feature and he ran out of

00:49:30,850 --> 00:49:35,050
time and he didn't have time to rewrite

00:49:33,070 --> 00:49:36,910
it from the ground up so it's licensed

00:49:35,050 --> 00:49:38,980
compatible so I think that was the

00:49:36,910 --> 00:49:41,470
biggest roadblock but we have a lot of

00:49:38,980 --> 00:49:44,910
history in trying to integrate that but

00:49:41,470 --> 00:49:48,400
then failing due to technicalities so we

00:49:44,910 --> 00:49:51,070
keep using our own translation coding

00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:55,950
Drupal 8 for mainly that reason yeah

00:49:51,070 --> 00:49:55,950
okay thank you yeah sorry for that I

00:49:57,780 --> 00:50:05,980
don't know yeah first of all thanks for

00:50:03,430 --> 00:50:07,720
doing a great job for this Thanks really

00:50:05,980 --> 00:50:12,700
impressive stuff so I'm looking forward

00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:14,740
things come in there and my question was

00:50:12,700 --> 00:50:19,930
really am just about what you mentioned

00:50:14,740 --> 00:50:25,380
there than the contextual stuff and my

00:50:19,930 --> 00:50:28,060
feeling is that many people try to

00:50:25,380 --> 00:50:30,300
translate strengths that have different

00:50:28,060 --> 00:50:33,340
meanings and in different languages

00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:39,070
stuff like the word post to post and a

00:50:33,340 --> 00:50:42,310
post and the people that at least from

00:50:39,070 --> 00:50:44,050
our experience or working with doing

00:50:42,310 --> 00:50:45,910
translations and stuff like that they're

00:50:44,050 --> 00:50:52,450
not really there they're taking cody

00:50:45,910 --> 00:50:56,260
people so and the problem to like say

00:50:52,450 --> 00:50:58,330
hey this string needs context that

00:50:56,260 --> 00:51:04,960
information like never gets out there I

00:50:58,330 --> 00:51:08,050
feel so you just and save it about how

00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:11,680
we how are your thoughts regarding doing

00:51:08,050 --> 00:51:13,480
that process easier and is there

00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:15,869
anything we could do to like let

00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:18,340
everyone say yeah you know easier way

00:51:15,869 --> 00:51:21,100
what it means two things this is one of

00:51:18,340 --> 00:51:24,310
the things that keep us from 14 to

00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:26,950
transifex is because we can we can like

00:51:24,310 --> 00:51:30,369
add a button and that will

00:51:26,950 --> 00:51:32,829
hopefully maybe create an issue on

00:51:30,369 --> 00:51:35,920
drupal.org directly on the project that

00:51:32,829 --> 00:51:40,089
all on projects that are using this

00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:43,210
string is not data that you have no

00:51:40,089 --> 00:51:45,940
context or not enough context so we

00:51:43,210 --> 00:51:47,950
could add a button about this this it

00:51:45,940 --> 00:51:50,470
would be a really fast the main question

00:51:47,950 --> 00:51:54,369
is would be automatic posting or just

00:51:50,470 --> 00:51:56,050
creating a new tab and you would do you

00:51:54,369 --> 00:51:58,750
would add your comment about the string

00:51:56,050 --> 00:52:02,230
needs that context for it to be

00:51:58,750 --> 00:52:05,760
translated but here it will it it's one

00:52:02,230 --> 00:52:09,760
of the thing is that that is in the

00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:11,800
localization server project so yeah it's

00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:15,690
one of the things that we would like to

00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:19,720
it yeah I think I think in terms of like

00:52:15,690 --> 00:52:21,940
getting the community like engaged in

00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:24,990
the translation and like giving great

00:52:21,940 --> 00:52:28,240
feedback I think that's a great way to

00:52:24,990 --> 00:52:30,790
like put in some effort like making it

00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:34,420
easier for non take you guys to just say

00:52:30,790 --> 00:52:36,190
yeah and yeah we need we need platform

00:52:34,420 --> 00:52:39,069
support for that because in transifex

00:52:36,190 --> 00:52:40,300
you can say this this string means this

00:52:39,069 --> 00:52:43,359
and you can explain it in the

00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:45,190
description but in Drupal what Drupal is

00:52:43,359 --> 00:52:47,650
going to look at is the source string

00:52:45,190 --> 00:52:49,180
and the context and that localize Drupal

00:52:47,650 --> 00:52:51,430
that or somebody wrote some message

00:52:49,180 --> 00:52:53,740
somewhere it doesn't care about that so

00:52:51,430 --> 00:52:56,920
if you use the same string for multiple

00:52:53,740 --> 00:52:58,810
meanings then we need the developer to

00:52:56,920 --> 00:53:00,400
add the context and the way we can get

00:52:58,810 --> 00:53:02,140
the developer is we have a button on

00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:04,150
local vegetable at org and we have

00:53:02,140 --> 00:53:06,970
single sign-on on drupal.org so we can

00:53:04,150 --> 00:53:08,619
get you you can then submit an issue

00:53:06,970 --> 00:53:10,450
Andruw Patrol or submit one for you

00:53:08,619 --> 00:53:14,800
because we know your user and ripple a

00:53:10,450 --> 00:53:16,599
dork so we can get that done there but

00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:18,400
we needed to get back to the code

00:53:16,599 --> 00:53:20,260
somehow sooner or later from the

00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:21,790
developer because otherwise that Drupal

00:53:20,260 --> 00:53:27,369
itself will not recognize that is a

00:53:21,790 --> 00:53:29,890
context yet I think it was one of the

00:53:27,369 --> 00:53:33,130
features that should be developed like

00:53:29,890 --> 00:53:35,780
fast and may be tested and then get back

00:53:33,130 --> 00:53:41,600
on that on this if

00:53:35,780 --> 00:53:44,480
it's not not enough yeah because right

00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:48,860
now we have lots of issues but there we

00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:53,240
can kind of we are kind of scared of

00:53:48,860 --> 00:53:57,770
putting it to to the site it's it's also

00:53:53,240 --> 00:54:01,880
because the localization server module

00:53:57,770 --> 00:54:04,610
could be used by others but we have we

00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:08,870
have a really stable really stable

00:54:04,610 --> 00:54:12,140
realism done so we could we could we

00:54:08,870 --> 00:54:15,830
should let the master not not the master

00:54:12,140 --> 00:54:19,760
the seven branch dev branch always on

00:54:15,830 --> 00:54:22,790
localize and once every every the whole

00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:25,040
localized community is happy with new

00:54:22,790 --> 00:54:27,470
features we should release it for the

00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:32,900
whole all the other side that are using

00:54:27,470 --> 00:54:34,730
the it's module okay so if there's no

00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:37,310
more questions that our question for you

00:54:34,730 --> 00:54:39,080
is who wants to get involved in making

00:54:37,310 --> 00:54:40,790
these things happen because these are

00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:42,800
nice plans that we explain what we don't

00:54:40,790 --> 00:54:45,530
have enough people to make them happen

00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:48,110
so they will remain plans in the issue

00:54:45,530 --> 00:54:51,310
queue unless we have people step up to

00:54:48,110 --> 00:55:01,220
help anybody interested in joining us

00:54:51,310 --> 00:55:06,530
