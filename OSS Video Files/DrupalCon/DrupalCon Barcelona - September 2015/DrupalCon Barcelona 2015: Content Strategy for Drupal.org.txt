welcome everyone this is a session about

00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:07,500
content strategy for Drupal the tour and

00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:09,120
I will talk about why we needed to

00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:12,179
develop content strategy in the first

00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:14,580
place what we did what are our main

00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:17,010
findings and recommended changes for the

00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:19,680
site however implementing those changes

00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:22,260
and how you can help us do it maybe if

00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:24,750
you want to there will be just a little

00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:27,990
bit of theory about what content

00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:30,330
strategy is like one slide no more and

00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:32,279
I've done the session before Los Angeles

00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:34,170
so for people who go there it's mostly

00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:37,079
the same there will be some updates on

00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:43,829
the progress on implementation in the

00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:47,730
end so let's start with y double the

00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:50,370
door is 13 years old by now and it's

00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:52,649
visual Luke and size and feature set

00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:54,960
evolved over the years you can see some

00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:57,180
of these steps on this journey the

00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,670
current design is based on Brandon and

00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:02,789
design work done by Mark Bolton and Lisa

00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:06,320
racold in 2008 which was a great work

00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:08,939
and it was also done over six years ago

00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:12,180
so in the meantime the website kept

00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:14,490
growing and changing and at some point

00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:17,490
it became obvious that the change is

00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:20,549
needed now drupal.org is not really a

00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:22,619
typical website it is really one of the

00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:24,299
largest and oldest continuously

00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:28,320
operating Drupal websites in the world

00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:30,240
and until recently it was also mostly

00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,640
maintained and built by community

00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:38,070
volunteers a few of them I in the room

00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:41,700
thank you for doing that so after years

00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:43,829
of organic growth the amount of content

00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:46,310
we have is really huge not many people

00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:49,560
realize quite how huge it is you have

00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:53,729
1.2 million pieces of content we have

00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:58,920
29,000 projects almost 800,000 issues

00:01:53,729 --> 00:02:01,229
and over 300,000 forum posts the amount

00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:03,540
of different audiences we have is also

00:02:01,229 --> 00:02:06,210
impressive from designers and developers

00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:09,649
to project managers marketing

00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:11,670
professionals technical writers trainers

00:02:09,649 --> 00:02:12,780
decision-makers all different kinds of

00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:14,970
people come to

00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:17,069
Drupal the door and they also range

00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:19,680
widely in their level experience

00:02:17,069 --> 00:02:23,520
knowledge of Drupal knowledge of Drupal

00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:26,310
ecosystem in addition to all of that

00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:29,400
complexity the tools website provides

00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:31,890
are also quite diverse and complex in

00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:35,630
one way or another we do provide two

00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:39,840
similar to that of stock exchange juara

00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:42,690
github Wikipedia meetup.com choke a

00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:48,380
Drupal showcase mozilla.org etc and all

00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:51,959
of that in one single website so when

00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:54,720
again just to reiterate this is huge and

00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:56,430
complex so when drupal association staff

00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,290
and drupal little content with the hook

00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:01,050
members started talking about the

00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:04,620
possible redesign given the complexity

00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:06,540
of the task we figured out that a simple

00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:08,280
visual refresh refresh wouldn't really

00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:10,709
help much if we change a few colors and

00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:13,260
some fonts here and there like didn't

00:03:10,709 --> 00:03:15,209
really make much of a difference what we

00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:17,549
really needed to do is almost

00:03:15,209 --> 00:03:19,350
deconstruct the website and rebuild it

00:03:17,549 --> 00:03:22,110
again to make it relevant for the next

00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:25,190
stage of drupal journey so where do you

00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:27,959
even start doing something big like that

00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:30,900
some people might have different ideas

00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:33,299
we decided to started user research so

00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:35,430
we've done it last summer it was

00:03:33,299 --> 00:03:38,010
performed by drupal association staff a

00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:40,280
few community volunteers and we had help

00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:43,680
from whitney has use experienced coach i

00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:45,480
hope you saw her keynote last drupal

00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,609
listener drupalcon and los angeles

00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:50,640
pacific interested if you didn't you can

00:03:47,609 --> 00:03:52,230
watch online so as a result of that

00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:55,109
project we developed a set of user

00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:56,760
personas for the side i won't talk too

00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:59,100
much about them they all are published

00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:02,609
so if you follow the URL you can read in

00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:05,519
detail about them so at that point we

00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:07,980
knew certain who our users are and their

00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:10,290
needs how do we give them the content

00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:13,500
they need to answer that question we

00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:15,390
partnered up with form one and we spent

00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:17,310
a few months figuring out content

00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:19,440
strategy for the website here are some

00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:22,049
of the pictures from our kickoff

00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:24,000
workshop in Portland which was lot of

00:04:22,049 --> 00:04:27,189
fun

00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:30,490
this is down a slide about theory so

00:04:27,189 --> 00:04:32,770
there are many different definitions of

00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:34,840
what content strategy is one of the most

00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:37,750
popular is this one by Christina Hager

00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:40,060
son content strategy plans for the

00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:43,569
creation publication and governance of

00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:46,389
useful and usable content that's a big

00:04:43,569 --> 00:04:48,789
definition and it encompasses many many

00:04:46,389 --> 00:04:50,110
different things and really every

00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:52,120
content strategy project is different

00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:53,379
based on what are the actual problems

00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:55,659
you're trying to solve for your

00:04:53,379 --> 00:04:57,729
particular website so some people might

00:04:55,659 --> 00:05:00,520
expect me to talk right now about the

00:04:57,729 --> 00:05:02,259
messaging framework voice intoned style

00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:05,349
guide that sort of thing and I'm not

00:05:02,259 --> 00:05:08,490
going to do that because Drupal the dork

00:05:05,349 --> 00:05:10,389
is so huge and has such long history and

00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:13,150
such a huge amount of user-generated

00:05:10,389 --> 00:05:15,400
content for our project we mostly

00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:18,460
focused on things like how do we produce

00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:20,409
and store high-quality content what are

00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:23,289
the actual content types and fields we

00:05:20,409 --> 00:05:25,419
need how do we organize this content and

00:05:23,289 --> 00:05:28,449
make sure it is findable how it is

00:05:25,419 --> 00:05:29,949
governed that sort of thing so that will

00:05:28,449 --> 00:05:35,229
be mostly what I will be talking about

00:05:29,949 --> 00:05:37,210
today so first we looked at the existing

00:05:35,229 --> 00:05:40,150
content types and how they are used on

00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:41,889
the site right now from the user

00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:44,289
research you had a list of what were

00:05:41,889 --> 00:05:47,650
called areas of user activity which are

00:05:44,289 --> 00:05:50,080
essentially big groups of tasks people

00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:51,639
perform on the website and we mapped all

00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:55,750
of the existing content types to those

00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:58,360
areas you can see what we got you will

00:05:55,750 --> 00:06:00,539
notice that book page content type is

00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:04,479
quite heavily used all over the place

00:06:00,539 --> 00:06:06,839
and the same goes for foreign pages same

00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:09,129
goes for user groups at the same time

00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:10,810
for some areas there are no sufficient

00:06:09,129 --> 00:06:12,219
tools the content types enter for

00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:16,509
example if you look on the project

00:06:12,219 --> 00:06:18,219
management of search and discovery those

00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:20,020
were the problems of fund now if you

00:06:18,219 --> 00:06:23,650
take a deeper look at some of the

00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:26,199
overused content types for example book

00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:28,060
pages book pages are really used for

00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:29,879
many many different things they used for

00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:32,770
general documentation such as

00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:35,020
understanding global multilingual diet

00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:36,820
etc they used for project specific

00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:38,860
documentation how to use view

00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:41,850
or whatever module they're used for

00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:44,050
tutorials and step by step how to guides

00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:46,060
they used for things what we call

00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:47,980
community instructions which is mostly

00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:49,870
get involved guide you know how to

00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:52,270
create your account how to use our see

00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:55,270
how to upload a patch that sort of thing

00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:59,440
they are used for marketing content and

00:06:55,270 --> 00:07:01,810
sometimes they even used to organize and

00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,370
try to communicate the status of the

00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:07,690
initiative people run which is like

00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:10,330
really hard to do the book page if you

00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:12,460
look at forums a similar thing they are

00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:14,200
used for obviously support they used a

00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:16,510
lot for that but also they're used for

00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:17,710
official news and announcements the ones

00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:19,780
you can see on the front page for

00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:22,300
example they all are forum posts for

00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:24,370
community posts for security adviser is

00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:25,810
not many people realize security

00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:28,840
advisors which you see are actually

00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:31,720
forum posts behind the scenes they also

00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:33,160
used for case studies events general

00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:34,630
group discussions and even doable

00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:36,970
services we have places where people

00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:40,630
like look for Wendell's to help with

00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:43,600
their projects and that sort of thing if

00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:49,110
you look at user groups they also just

00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:51,820
quite heavily for many things there are

00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:53,500
announcement only groups sort of

00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:56,080
lockdown groups such as core and

00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:59,230
governance cos people had no other place

00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:01,390
to use for announcements so they had to

00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:03,310
create these groups they used for

00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:05,410
project based groups so some people

00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:08,140
organize work around contributed

00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:10,450
projects such as rules a panoply for

00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:13,240
example in a group ungrouped the

00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:14,680
drupal.org working groups and

00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:16,630
initiatives such as mobile and

00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:19,300
multilingual initiatives for Drupal core

00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:22,180
have groups obviously there are local

00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:25,090
user groups groups for CT original

00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:27,670
country etc and various interest groups

00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:31,979
for software and non software interests

00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:36,400
some are very exciting like Newton stuff

00:08:31,979 --> 00:08:38,919
so what we see overall is that a single

00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:41,200
content type is often used for too many

00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:43,300
different use cases and each one of

00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,130
those requires different layouts

00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:48,640
different permission structure different

00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:49,800
fields at the same time we see that a

00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:52,649
single use case

00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:55,140
often met by multiple different content

00:08:52,649 --> 00:08:57,149
types in different locations which makes

00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:58,320
it really really hard for users

00:08:57,149 --> 00:08:59,880
especially new prime minister and

00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,010
learners to know which is the right

00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:04,649
place for this thing they are trying to

00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:06,630
do and in addition to all of that there

00:09:04,649 --> 00:09:08,760
are some user needs which we uncovered

00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:11,279
in user research for which we don't even

00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:16,320
have any specific content types right

00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:18,630
now so looking at all of that I got very

00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:20,940
excited obviously an astride a started

00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:22,500
brainstorming all the virus wonderful

00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:24,029
content types you could create and like

00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:26,700
we had huge spreadsheets and they came

00:09:24,029 --> 00:09:28,649
growing and example to start to worry

00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:30,959
that it's like too much you don't

00:09:28,649 --> 00:09:32,880
actually need hundreds of content types

00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:36,380
to try and meet different use cases for

00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:39,060
different personas so what we did next

00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:41,550
we looked at how the content is

00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:43,440
organized and structured to see if

00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:48,450
there's any room for improvement and we

00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:51,149
did find a few things obviously so first

00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:53,910
of all content on drupal.org right now

00:09:51,149 --> 00:09:56,730
is organized by content type not by

00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:59,220
persona or by user task or anything so

00:09:56,730 --> 00:10:01,440
for issues to go here for book pages

00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:04,440
over here case that assigned this corner

00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:06,420
and forum posts over here the problem

00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:08,720
that is that users don't really think in

00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:12,029
terms of foreign pages of book pages

00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:13,980
instead they might think well I want to

00:10:12,029 --> 00:10:16,770
know what is the status of the score

00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:19,020
initiative well the answer can be on

00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:21,089
groups the Drupal little it can be in

00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:23,250
the meta issue somewhere it can be on a

00:10:21,089 --> 00:10:25,829
book page it can be even on external

00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:28,079
website which makes it really hard for

00:10:25,829 --> 00:10:30,149
people to find things because they don't

00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:35,699
know what is the right place to look for

00:10:30,149 --> 00:10:37,649
something the next problem is that a

00:10:35,699 --> 00:10:40,470
piece of content on drupal.org is

00:10:37,649 --> 00:10:41,970
generally only displayed in one place on

00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:45,029
the side so when you look at something

00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:48,089
you don't see all the other pieces of

00:10:45,029 --> 00:10:50,880
content related to this one its context

00:10:48,089 --> 00:10:52,860
this makes it really hard to naturally

00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,640
discover other sections and parts of the

00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:55,560
site and right

00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:58,860
and content for what you're looking at

00:10:55,560 --> 00:11:02,160
so generally right now Drupal diffusers

00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:05,100
land on a page at the research or by

00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:07,770
following day where I come and have it

00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:09,420
in our community by memorizing the URL

00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:18,060
and actually type in it in turn browser

00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:21,150
to get somewhere which is not ideal so

00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:23,220
the third big problem is the primary

00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:26,040
ways of structuring content and Drupal

00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:28,560
the door right now custom coded

00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:32,040
horizontal menus or book hierarchy and

00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:34,590
both of them have limitations the main

00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:36,420
problem of custom coded horizontal menus

00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:38,910
is obviously that they are custom coded

00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:40,320
and their horizontal because they're

00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:42,660
custom coded if you want to change in

00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:45,150
menu item you actually need to make

00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:47,040
commit to beat and deploy a new version

00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:50,040
of module production just to change your

00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:52,260
menu item because they are horizontal it

00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:54,420
also limits the number of many items you

00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:58,020
can have and how long they can be until

00:11:54,420 --> 00:12:02,310
they start breaking things the book

00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:04,350
hierarchy on the other hand creates

00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:06,600
books that include so many contents

00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:09,840
sometimes that it's not really usable if

00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:11,970
you as you can see in this example this

00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:14,760
also is problematic because sometimes

00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:17,010
books are include content oriented on

00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:19,200
absolutely different audiences for

00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:21,930
example getting involved itís build

00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:24,650
example collection of stuff for

00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:24,650
different people

00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:33,040
lastly we have very flat commission

00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:34,960
structure because there is no

00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:37,450
organization structure beside the

00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:39,850
content type right now permission system

00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:42,100
is pretty flat and that everyone can

00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:44,170
edit and create content on specific type

00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:46,360
or a group of people can based on user

00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:48,370
role assign in a number of people to a

00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:50,620
number of pages to maintain them it's

00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:53,670
not really possible and moreover to

00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:56,350
limit access to some pages we have to do

00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:58,480
no typical solutions such as we have

00:12:56,350 --> 00:13:00,550
special input filter to log some pages

00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:06,700
from being editable by any person on the

00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:10,000
side which is not ideal so our findings

00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:13,810
can be summarized to actionable items

00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:16,120
really we need to separate content from

00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:18,070
structure we need to have content types

00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:20,290
which are used only to create content

00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:24,010
and we need to use different means to

00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:25,810
bring structure to this content and we

00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:27,820
need to structure content around user

00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:30,100
tasks so instead of having five

00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:31,600
different places about the thing we

00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:33,070
would have one place about the thing

00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,500
with five different content types

00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:37,120
available depending on what is the type

00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:41,890
of content you are trying to create or

00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:43,839
find so separating cotton from structure

00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:46,779
and structure and content around user

00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:48,820
tasks now I will talk a bit about our

00:13:46,779 --> 00:13:52,450
plans how we can achieve this on

00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:55,180
drupal.org separate on content from

00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:57,160
structure we will do this as I said by

00:13:55,180 --> 00:14:00,400
having a set of generic content types

00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:02,709
which are which will have specific clear

00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:04,540
use case for them they will be used to

00:14:02,709 --> 00:14:08,020
create content and other means will

00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:10,630
bring structure around the content so

00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:12,990
here you can see our planned a new

00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:15,430
content model for Drupal the door the

00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:18,220
greenboxes a new content types which

00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:19,870
currently do not exist at all yellow

00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:21,459
boxes are content types which you do

00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:24,790
exist but they will be changed slightly

00:14:21,459 --> 00:14:27,040
perhaps our field change or display mode

00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:29,110
change things like that in grey boxes

00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:30,790
are content types which exist and we're

00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:34,779
not going to touch them they are sort of

00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:37,540
fine so on the left you can see basic

00:14:34,779 --> 00:14:39,730
content types there the genetic things

00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:41,329
which will be used for content creation

00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:43,569
whereas simple use

00:14:41,329 --> 00:14:46,339
is for each if you want to create static

00:14:43,569 --> 00:14:48,199
information you use page if you want to

00:14:46,339 --> 00:14:50,420
create dynamic content with comments and

00:14:48,199 --> 00:14:52,489
discussion you use post if you want done

00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:54,879
on save and use event if you want to

00:14:52,489 --> 00:14:57,529
document software you use documentation

00:14:54,879 --> 00:15:00,769
in the middle you can see our group

00:14:57,529 --> 00:15:03,139
content types so those are content types

00:15:00,769 --> 00:15:05,449
will use to bring structure two things

00:15:03,139 --> 00:15:08,089
so basic content types can be created

00:15:05,449 --> 00:15:10,069
inside of all those groups in some cases

00:15:08,089 --> 00:15:12,019
group content types also can be created

00:15:10,069 --> 00:15:14,089
inside of each other which is a little

00:15:12,019 --> 00:15:18,170
bit inception and I will talk about it

00:15:14,089 --> 00:15:20,089
later on the right you can also see a

00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:23,360
list of helper content types and they're

00:15:20,089 --> 00:15:25,579
mostly not user generated so we kind of

00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:28,639
separated them and also entity types we

00:15:25,579 --> 00:15:33,049
have such as I user profiles commits etc

00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:34,819
now let's talk a little bit more about

00:15:33,049 --> 00:15:38,149
group content dives because they are

00:15:34,819 --> 00:15:41,179
sort of most interesting ones so

00:15:38,149 --> 00:15:43,040
projects as groups this is not really a

00:15:41,179 --> 00:15:46,790
new idea we talked about it a few years

00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:49,160
before by turning projects into groups

00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:51,139
will give maintainer much better tools

00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:52,999
to manage their projects they will be

00:15:51,139 --> 00:15:55,610
able to create things like posts

00:15:52,999 --> 00:15:57,470
roadmaps maybe announcements inside of a

00:15:55,610 --> 00:16:01,009
group they will be able to announce

00:15:57,470 --> 00:16:03,319
Sprint's if they need to create official

00:16:01,009 --> 00:16:06,499
project documentation connected to this

00:16:03,319 --> 00:16:08,239
project other people will be able to

00:16:06,499 --> 00:16:10,759
follow the project and receive

00:16:08,239 --> 00:16:15,259
notifications about your content being

00:16:10,759 --> 00:16:21,649
created how awesome is that another idea

00:16:15,259 --> 00:16:23,600
is organizations as groups we do have

00:16:21,649 --> 00:16:26,389
organization pages on Drupal the top

00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:28,730
right now they're fairly simple by

00:16:26,389 --> 00:16:30,589
turning them into groups we again will

00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:33,369
give companies much better tools to

00:16:30,589 --> 00:16:35,720
manage their presence on the website so

00:16:33,369 --> 00:16:37,639
perhaps they will have better layouts

00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:39,230
they might be able to create some

00:16:37,639 --> 00:16:42,759
additional pieces of content inside

00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:44,869
organization such as post announcement

00:16:42,759 --> 00:16:47,119
multiple people will be able to edit

00:16:44,869 --> 00:16:48,850
organization which will make it easier

00:16:47,119 --> 00:16:51,399
when some people leave the company

00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:54,850
and then no one can actually right now

00:16:51,399 --> 00:16:57,430
touch the page etc one of the biggest

00:16:54,850 --> 00:17:00,190
advantages though is that they will be

00:16:57,430 --> 00:17:02,170
able to manage people who are listed as

00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:04,240
a staff member members because right now

00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:06,130
essentially any user on Drupal the door

00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:12,640
can claim they work for any company

00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:14,829
which is not ideal the next example our

00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:17,500
initiatives this is a completely new

00:17:14,829 --> 00:17:19,569
content type we are thinking about the

00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:21,730
main idea behind it is to give tools to

00:17:19,569 --> 00:17:24,370
community members to manage large

00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:27,819
initiatives so they will be able to

00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:30,190
create say events posts and pages inside

00:17:27,819 --> 00:17:32,230
of the initiative and they will be able

00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:33,970
to relate some other content types to

00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:36,520
the initiatives such as projects and

00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:39,370
issues and the relationship to go both

00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:41,679
ways so one initiative can span multiple

00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:44,970
projects and one project can be related

00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:47,710
to multiple initiatives this will give

00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:50,289
leads of those initiatives ability to

00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:53,320
actually show what the work is and what

00:17:50,289 --> 00:17:55,090
the progress is here are 20 issues which

00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:57,309
is the scope of the initiative here at

00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:59,289
the 5 we're working on right now here at

00:17:57,309 --> 00:18:01,360
the 5 our next priority that sort of

00:17:59,289 --> 00:18:03,640
thing right now ishik us don't really

00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:05,980
let us do it easily it's sort of just a

00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:11,409
list of issues you can't drag and drop

00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:15,059
them around so those are some of the

00:18:11,409 --> 00:18:17,740
examples of group content types our

00:18:15,059 --> 00:18:21,070
second recommendation was to structure

00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:23,799
content around user tasks this means

00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:27,880
we'll create a sections on the side

00:18:23,799 --> 00:18:29,710
around user activity we took the areas

00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:31,600
of user activity i mentioned earlier and

00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:33,309
we combine them with the current to pull

00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:36,520
it off site map and things we already

00:18:33,309 --> 00:18:39,429
have and we got this set of potential

00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:42,030
our sections you will see the circles

00:18:39,429 --> 00:18:44,559
have different size there's sort of

00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:46,120
relative to the size of the section so

00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:48,640
some of them will be very small and

00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:52,630
simple and some of them will be really

00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:54,700
huge and complicated each section will

00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:56,740
have a purpose and an audience defined

00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:59,260
and each section will have primary owner

00:18:56,740 --> 00:19:00,800
and a set of rules for users who can

00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:02,930
create or edit content

00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:05,180
inside of this section and sometimes it

00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:07,640
will mean that any user on the site can

00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:09,230
create any content in particular section

00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:14,450
which is fine if that's what we want to

00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:16,430
do so this sections will make up the top

00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:18,740
level of drupal.org sitemap and

00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:20,540
essentially every piece of content on

00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:22,820
the site will be inside of one of these

00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:24,650
the only content which will really live

00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:27,350
outside of everything will be things

00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:30,730
like terms of service privacy policy

00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:33,890
side wide contact form that's about it

00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:35,600
now we have so many sections I can't

00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:38,720
really talk about all of them otherwise

00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:40,850
it'll take too much time I will give a

00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:43,310
few examples just to show you sort of

00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:46,730
what we imagining to see inside of a

00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:48,860
section so for example why Drupal this

00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:52,310
will be a section for people who

00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:54,380
evaluate Drupal essentially this will be

00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:56,720
a set of high-quality marketing

00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:58,460
materials right now we don't really have

00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:01,580
good marketing content on the website

00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:04,700
the one we do have is in book pages and

00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:08,150
it's not really too exciting or engaging

00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:10,670
for that matter so this section would

00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:12,620
have content about Drupal about history

00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:15,140
about features technical marketing

00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:18,020
materials high quality case studies

00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:21,560
potentially official Drupal blow that

00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:24,590
sort of thing another example is

00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:27,020
community so community right now we do

00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:28,580
have a page just gold which has URL

00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:32,630
community and it's sort of just static

00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:35,120
page of text we want to create an actual

00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:38,240
section which will be a place to find

00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:40,460
and talk to Drupal community it will

00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:43,850
include things like listing of users

00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:45,710
listing of organizations and we mean all

00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:48,110
organizations so service providers

00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:51,110
hosting providers trainer providers as

00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:53,000
well as end users or really any company

00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:56,560
which has some relation to Drupal and

00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:59,210
wants to create an organization page

00:20:56,560 --> 00:21:01,790
this section will also include local and

00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:03,410
interest user groups which means we will

00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:06,620
migrate them from groups the Drupal

00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:09,740
deter into the main website this gives

00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:11,740
us ability to connect it more title to

00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:13,670
the rest of the content we have and also

00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:15,290
lessen burden of may

00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:18,680
tenancy bit because we will have one

00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:22,100
less separate website to maintain in

00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:23,540
addition to other advantages the other

00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:25,250
thing which can be included here is

00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:27,710
coming in to showcase so a place for

00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:32,780
people to show off drupal websites they

00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:35,240
build things like that contribute

00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:37,070
section on this section will highlight

00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:39,550
all the ways you can contribute to the

00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:42,020
project and how to get started doing so

00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:43,910
initiatives the content type i mentioned

00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:45,800
her level live here so people will be

00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:47,870
able to see what are all the extra

00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:49,730
initiatives right now what's going on

00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:52,790
how you can enroll you get involved and

00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:55,040
start helping some of those mostly

00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:57,080
current content for this section lives

00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:58,700
in getting world guide so essentially

00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:01,820
what we want to do is take this content

00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:08,000
and present in much more engaging way

00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:10,280
than just the set of book pages I think

00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,810
let's enough examples I can talk more

00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:14,120
about sections if anyone interested

00:22:11,810 --> 00:22:16,370
after the dog that now a little bit

00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:19,250
about how we actually built in this so

00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:22,610
behind the scenes are each section will

00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:24,800
be an organic group now I want to say

00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:26,570
right the way they will not look or work

00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:28,130
exactly like groups and groups the

00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:29,840
Drupal the door right now that is the

00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:33,530
Drupal 6 side there will be much better

00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:36,440
in most cases nothing will really show

00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:38,360
to the end-user that particular section

00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:40,910
of the site is an again group if they

00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:42,620
don't need to know about it and building

00:22:40,910 --> 00:22:44,720
sections as groups gives us all the

00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:48,020
things we talked about these things we

00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:50,390
need so whereas types of content can be

00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:51,860
created inside of a section we can have

00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:54,190
maintained errs and editors for a

00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:57,740
section we can have notifications on

00:22:54,190 --> 00:23:01,790
content changes and content can be added

00:22:57,740 --> 00:23:04,160
to multiple sections if needed well

00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:06,200
obviously all of the things I talked

00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:08,320
about the days where a big undertaking

00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:12,920
and it won't be done in like a week or

00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:15,740
even two weeks so we already started and

00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:17,960
I will give a little update on our

00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:22,340
progress on the actual implementation of

00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:24,230
all of these changes so first of all the

00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:26,210
obviously presented our findings and

00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:26,600
collected some feedback from the

00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:28,940
community

00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:30,860
we did presentations for working groups

00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:33,200
we had a session of the book on Los

00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:35,419
Angeles everything I talked about is

00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:38,360
published in the issue cues I will give

00:23:35,419 --> 00:23:40,910
a set of links to issues if you want to

00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:46,160
read more we also published blog posts

00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:48,110
on Association website tweets etc to

00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:50,330
visualize all the recommendations at

00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:52,640
least for ourselves and make it easier

00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:55,220
to talk about these things we built a

00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:58,070
sort of future state sitemap for Drupal

00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:59,870
the door which is like a huge Google

00:23:58,070 --> 00:24:03,169
drawing this is screenshot probably not

00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:04,909
really easily readable but it's a huge

00:24:03,169 --> 00:24:07,850
thing and it's obviously not final yet

00:24:04,909 --> 00:24:11,539
we are going to verify some of our ideas

00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:13,970
about locations and titles for things by

00:24:11,539 --> 00:24:17,600
doing things like card sort and excess

00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:21,350
of exercises for example so it might

00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:24,260
change another work we were doing is

00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:26,929
sort of translating these high-level

00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:28,640
ideas about content strategy into what

00:24:26,929 --> 00:24:31,880
are the actual things we need to build

00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:34,880
and we are doing this by writing set of

00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:36,679
user stories really a lot of them this

00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:39,830
is the screenshot from one of our

00:24:36,679 --> 00:24:42,409
numerous spreadsheets so you can see on

00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:44,059
the very left sort of a big user story

00:24:42,409 --> 00:24:46,700
which describes the whole section why

00:24:44,059 --> 00:24:48,440
Drupal what we've done is rebuilt all

00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:51,020
the content strategy recommendations

00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:53,570
into a set of those big user stories so

00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:55,280
that we could prioritize them with the

00:24:53,570 --> 00:24:56,990
working groups and say here are the

00:24:55,280 --> 00:25:00,590
sections where are going to build first

00:24:56,990 --> 00:25:03,200
and this will come next then we build

00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:05,780
those big break are those big user

00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:07,970
stories into smaller ones based on

00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:09,770
different user personas or different

00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:12,049
types of activity happening in the

00:25:09,770 --> 00:25:15,799
section and then we break them even

00:25:12,049 --> 00:25:17,630
smaller into sort of individual tasks

00:25:15,799 --> 00:25:19,280
people perform so that we can actually

00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:22,570
talk what are the features we need to

00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:25,460
build to support all those scenarios and

00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:27,080
this is some going work obviously to

00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:28,549
write it all down for all the section

00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:30,919
takes some time so we're just going to

00:25:28,549 --> 00:25:33,940
slowly one by one depending on the

00:25:30,919 --> 00:25:33,940
priority of the sections

00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:42,400
in parallel with that we were sort of

00:25:40,690 --> 00:25:45,340
preparing the plumbing for this whole

00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:47,320
thing so we identified the minimal set

00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:49,990
of modules needed to enable this

00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:51,760
structural change on the website then I

00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:53,230
built integration server which is a

00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:55,510
complete copy of production

00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:57,340
infrastructure so that we could actually

00:25:55,510 --> 00:26:00,130
test it heavily before we deploy

00:25:57,340 --> 00:26:02,380
anything we've done lots of performance

00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:03,940
testing to make sure we won't terribly

00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:06,120
slow the website and things like that

00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:09,640
and results are positive so we actually

00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:11,740
deployed initial set of modules on the

00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:14,190
bullet or colleges so we do have organic

00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:16,900
groups on Drupal the door and we do have

00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:21,190
section content type so we can start

00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:23,980
actually building new sections and the

00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:27,130
first two sections will be focusing on

00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:29,890
why Drupal and documentation our

00:26:27,130 --> 00:26:32,410
communications team well mainly our

00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:34,690
content strategist Bradley is now really

00:26:32,410 --> 00:26:37,690
focusing on wide rubles he's working on

00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:40,380
things like messaging framework what are

00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:43,660
the actual messages want to tell people

00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:45,520
in that section as well as wireframe and

00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:48,730
some of the possible pages are we to

00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:50,470
live inside of it at the same time we

00:26:48,730 --> 00:26:53,049
started working on the communication

00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:56,110
section and we started by working with

00:26:53,049 --> 00:26:58,419
the stakeholders in this case they are

00:26:56,110 --> 00:27:00,820
documentation working group so we wanted

00:26:58,419 --> 00:27:03,010
to really make sure whatever goals

00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:04,990
priorities and ideas they have will

00:27:03,010 --> 00:27:08,559
match really well to what we're building

00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:10,419
so we've done sort of an online workshop

00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:13,630
with documentation working group members

00:27:10,419 --> 00:27:16,750
for like about four hours when we talked

00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:18,880
through each user story to get agreement

00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:21,040
on what exactly that means what will be

00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:24,370
the steps people will take to achieve

00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:27,640
certain goals and screenshot here again

00:27:24,370 --> 00:27:30,100
it's a huge role of post-its which were

00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:31,660
created in Google drawing the posts all

00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:34,030
are all over the place we can't really

00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:36,850
be in the same room so it's it's a very

00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:38,919
huge Google drawing the app screenshot

00:27:36,850 --> 00:27:41,169
can't really show all the puter with

00:27:38,919 --> 00:27:45,400
that i will give you URL if you want to

00:27:41,169 --> 00:27:47,440
see so right now the team in the

00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:50,019
association is working through

00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:51,700
actual implementation details for what

00:27:50,019 --> 00:27:53,919
are the features we need to be able to

00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:59,409
support those user stories for

00:27:53,919 --> 00:28:01,389
documentation section and the huge part

00:27:59,409 --> 00:28:03,639
of work for documentation section

00:28:01,389 --> 00:28:06,490
specifically will be content audit and

00:28:03,639 --> 00:28:08,409
moderation we have right now 12,000

00:28:06,490 --> 00:28:11,320
documentation pages on Drupal the door

00:28:08,409 --> 00:28:14,019
and we have about four staff people i

00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:15,940
think i'm imagining for maybe less who

00:28:14,019 --> 00:28:18,730
can actually work on this so it will

00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:21,309
take us a really really long time if you

00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:23,320
want to help us this friday you can come

00:28:21,309 --> 00:28:26,019
at the sprints and we will be doing

00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:30,210
audits of the current documentation on

00:28:26,019 --> 00:28:33,519
the ballot or it will start at 11am room

00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:36,009
114 so if you're not habit content

00:28:33,519 --> 00:28:41,259
strategy this is the best place to do it

00:28:36,009 --> 00:28:43,600
right now now when I still have a little

00:28:41,259 --> 00:28:45,340
voice left I want to say thanks to

00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:48,700
various people who helped us during this

00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:51,940
whole thing obviously content to a group

00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:56,409
members like George over here and Roy

00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:58,779
Jeff our mark on team forum one Kourtney

00:28:56,409 --> 00:29:01,090
Michaela Christina all the other work in

00:28:58,779 --> 00:29:02,860
hopes of supported us and staff members

00:29:01,090 --> 00:29:08,470
and community members who provided us

00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:10,419
feedback which was really helpful as I

00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:12,220
said here are some links you can see in

00:29:10,419 --> 00:29:14,320
the slides later those are the actual

00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:18,159
issues about everything I talked about

00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:21,120
today essentially I think that's it

00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:21,120
thank you

00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:33,610
so if anyone has any questions there's a

00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:33,610
mic over there so feel free to ask

00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:48,140
hello I have two questions one is just

00:29:44,630 --> 00:29:49,760
out of curiosity 1.2 million pages how

00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:51,590
on earth did you start your content

00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:55,130
audit or year to find the different

00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:57,200
types of content well we kind of did

00:29:55,130 --> 00:29:58,940
database queries to get number section

00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:03,140
if it didn't look at every single page

00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:04,880
obviously and its really I mean you can

00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:07,250
imagine how long it will take us so what

00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:08,840
we do instead we will do it section by

00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:11,090
section so right now we're working on

00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:13,910
documentation so we will do the audit of

00:30:11,090 --> 00:30:16,790
documentation pages only it's 12,000 so

00:30:13,910 --> 00:30:18,650
it's a little less next we'll work on

00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:20,150
something else will take whatever is

00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:23,270
relevant for that in your section and

00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:24,800
we'll do order there because I mean we

00:30:23,270 --> 00:30:26,570
will just be locked in the room doing

00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:29,600
ordered for weeks if we just wanted to

00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:31,310
do it which is not really realistic and

00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:34,070
I think the other question I've got is

00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:35,480
just out of curiosity I've been involved

00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:37,990
with sort of personas and content

00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:39,650
strategy work and then also using

00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:42,140
personalization you know to actually

00:30:39,650 --> 00:30:44,090
look and check your hypotheses that you

00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:45,560
know people are certain types of people

00:30:44,090 --> 00:30:47,270
like you know novices or people that you

00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:49,460
identify as being experts are looking at

00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:50,900
certain things I sort of thinking about

00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:52,430
hooking that in at some point you know

00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:54,620
using things like lift so you can

00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:56,120
actually you know look at what your new

00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:58,790
personas are and sort of see what's

00:30:56,120 --> 00:31:00,860
happening on drupal.org yeah that would

00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:04,160
be really interesting we are thinking

00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:06,050
about some waste or at least identify

00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:08,120
those people because like there is no

00:31:06,050 --> 00:31:10,400
field on user profile to say yes I'm an

00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:12,260
expert on I'm and master and it's also

00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:14,750
hard because it changes over time but

00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:17,480
perhaps some sort of survey or something

00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:19,970
to at least be able to see you know we

00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:21,830
actually have fifty percent of masters

00:31:19,970 --> 00:31:23,390
of something would be really helpful we

00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:25,790
don't have anything right now to pull

00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:31,940
the door to do that but hopefully in

00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:34,080
future thank you welcome any more

00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:36,029
questions

00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:39,480
I mean I thought I explained everything

00:31:36,029 --> 00:31:42,330
single so you were talking about the

00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:44,820
project grouping if you will right and I

00:31:42,330 --> 00:31:48,870
saw that there was documentation in that

00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:51,000
set is maybe which wasn't quite

00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:52,200
following but is documentation going to

00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,450
be a little bit more accessible from

00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:56,700
likes a project pages yes yes okay

00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:57,990
definitely I guess because managing

00:31:56,700 --> 00:32:03,149
projects as something that has been

00:31:57,990 --> 00:32:05,220
relatively very difficult and like how I

00:32:03,149 --> 00:32:07,620
can talk to you later but I just was

00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:09,659
curious like are there also move like

00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:11,700
forums for like support for projects as

00:32:09,659 --> 00:32:14,250
well or is that going to be something

00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:17,519
completely different we haven't thought

00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:19,500
about that yet because support section

00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:21,779
went once we do this that prioritization

00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:23,250
support section was kind of lower down

00:32:21,779 --> 00:32:26,909
so we didn't really do much thinking

00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:29,100
about it perhaps in the future we might

00:32:26,909 --> 00:32:31,110
add Q&A content type and that can be

00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:33,720
available in the project so you can have

00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:38,299
like sort of section for Q&A about this

00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:38,299
project specifically or if we want to

00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:51,470
okay in my questions ray I guess explain

00:32:47,639 --> 00:32:51,470
