Description: 
	You're just minding your own IT exec-business, drinking coffee and catching up to emails. Suddenly the boss bursts into your office!!!!

A key security release for Drupal is causing all sorts of weird headlines!

To make things worse, your dev team is at a conference in Spain and you need to address these issues ASAP.

How are you going to address these issues??  Luckily, you chose to build your Drupal 8 websites on the Acquia Platform, for its simple yet extensive embedded tool set. 

Come join Acquia as we take you through a journey of our dev tools and show you how quickly, easily and safely you can:

Deploy security patches

hello everyone welcome thanks for coming

00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:27,269
along I think we'll kick it off I think

00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:29,280
people have stopped coming in so my name

00:03:27,269 --> 00:03:30,930
is Cameron I went for a clear on the

00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,639
solutions architect and today I'm going

00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:34,530
to be talking about the developer tools

00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:37,079
they actually offers as part of its

00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:39,750
managed hosting service Acquia cloud and

00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:43,799
some of the other tools around that and

00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:45,780
i am going to act as though i am a CTR a

00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:47,760
technical leader at a company who

00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:49,500
understands technology and coding and

00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:52,829
the command line but maybe isn't quite

00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:55,470
as familiar with drupal and without

00:03:52,829 --> 00:03:58,019
clear tools solo hopefully like some of

00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:59,849
you are I'm also going to pretend to be

00:03:58,019 --> 00:04:02,969
a clear support so when you see me wear

00:03:59,849 --> 00:04:07,019
this hat I'm a different person that'll

00:04:02,969 --> 00:04:11,069
all come out in due course have a couple

00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:14,459
of it coming in ok so setting the scene

00:04:11,069 --> 00:04:16,949
it's a thursday night my developers are

00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:19,410
all away at drupalcon Barcelona and I've

00:04:16,949 --> 00:04:21,470
got tickets to go and see secret cinema

00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:23,550
I'm going to dress up as a x-wing pilot

00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:25,800
and I'm going to have a good time

00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:28,979
everything's quiet at work nothing's

00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:31,500
going wrong I'm feeling good we've got a

00:04:28,979 --> 00:04:34,860
few things coming up next week but for

00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:36,240
now everything's fine so I want to get

00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:39,229
out of here by five today you know I

00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,229
want to make sure everything's working

00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:44,070
then my boss comes around the corner he

00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:45,840
says there's something wrong with the

00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:47,610
site and you need to look at it and

00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:51,060
there's no way that you are leaving this

00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:55,770
place until it's fixed and this is how

00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:58,320
it makes me feel okay so I'm going to go

00:04:55,770 --> 00:05:04,229
and I'm going to look at the site so let

00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:07,380
me just open up my browsing here sorry

00:05:04,229 --> 00:05:12,710
guys you have to close them powerpoint

00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:12,710
you for a second technical difficulties

00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:22,780
now I've got a bookmarked so let me open

00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:24,190
it up and see what's happening here okay

00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:26,320
so obviously I don't really want to have

00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:27,370
a rickroll sitting on the top of my

00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,690
sight and seems like one of my

00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:31,090
developers is a lift a nice little

00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:32,410
present for me before they went away and

00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:36,490
I'm going to have to figure out how to

00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:39,850
fix this so what am I going to do well

00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:42,420
what I did know is that when it clear

00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:45,760
our brought us onto the platform

00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:48,730
attended the onboarding call and they

00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:50,350
gave me access to the platform so I've

00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:52,810
got a login I can look at things and

00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:54,220
what I need to do is get in there figure

00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:55,870
out how to edit the code figure out how

00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:57,820
to test the code and then obviously push

00:05:55,870 --> 00:06:01,540
the code life so that that rick roll is

00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:05,500
gone from the site so let's check that

00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:11,590
out shall we so I go to that queer site

00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:15,040
and I open up my login and this is the

00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:17,950
page that I see so as an a clear

00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:21,280
customer we get production in staging in

00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:25,180
development environments by default and

00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:27,910
I can see here that the developers will

00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:29,530
leave something for me and what I want

00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:30,880
to do is check this locally so I don't

00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:33,100
want to eat it it directly on the server

00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,990
because there be dragons but what I

00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:36,960
might want to do is grab a copy of the

00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:39,370
code work on it in my local environment

00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:42,820
so another thing that was offered to me

00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:46,000
as I was on board and tak where was

00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:49,780
something called Acquia dev desktop and

00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:52,150
so if I open that up what we see here is

00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:55,480
a local development environment that

00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:57,250
integrates a petty in my sequel in PHP

00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:59,590
but it's also integrated with a lot of

00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:02,470
their Acquia cloud tools so it's aware

00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:04,720
of a clear cloud of my hosting its aware

00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:07,510
of the git repositories that sit behind

00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:10,390
a clear cloud and I can interact with

00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:12,550
that directly from here so in this case

00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:16,690
as i'm logged in and I've got both of my

00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:18,730
sites hosted an ant we allowed I can see

00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:20,560
that each has a div stage and production

00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:22,810
environment so what I want to do is

00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,550
bring the code down to my local machine

00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:27,229
so that I can work on

00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:29,090
so if I look here i can say with the

00:07:27,229 --> 00:07:31,460
local workflow i want to pull from the

00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:34,219
cloud development environment and if i

00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:36,199
click here i can say i'm going to pull

00:07:34,219 --> 00:07:37,729
down just the code we're not too worried

00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:40,400
about the database and files from now

00:07:37,729 --> 00:07:43,069
i'm fairly confident that it's just an

00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:46,819
era and the code so if i click this big

00:07:43,069 --> 00:07:49,939
shiny button here if this type will

00:07:46,819 --> 00:07:53,330
handle all of the stuff around get to do

00:07:49,939 --> 00:07:55,129
with my ssh key you know connecting and

00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:57,500
take Leah cloud pulling from the right

00:07:55,129 --> 00:08:00,050
repository and syncing so I've got a

00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:02,479
local environment and then I'll have a

00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:07,370
copy of the site running locally so if I

00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:13,550
click on this we should see site burning

00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:16,129
up and running locally so now I need to

00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:20,449
edit that in my development environment

00:08:16,129 --> 00:08:23,000
so I open up my IDE and very quickly

00:08:20,449 --> 00:08:28,610
when I look at this template file I can

00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:30,650
see that there's a big issue here this

00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:32,269
is a an embedded I frame with a YouTube

00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:38,560
minute that's not what I want so let me

00:08:32,269 --> 00:08:43,219
go ahead and delete that you know just

00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:45,260
it looks good okay pop back into the dev

00:08:43,219 --> 00:08:47,300
desktop and now what I want to do having

00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:51,199
it a bit locally is push it all the way

00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:52,940
back up back into the equity cloud so i

00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:54,589
can test it so that if it looks good I

00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:57,079
can then push it back out to production

00:08:54,589 --> 00:08:59,380
so in this case I'm going to use the

00:08:57,079 --> 00:09:02,839
devious time you know I'm going to push

00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:05,329
to the cloud you know and I've I neither

00:09:02,839 --> 00:09:08,180
to the code so I'm going to push that up

00:09:05,329 --> 00:09:10,459
only push the code up not the rest of

00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:13,310
the components of the Drupal site you

00:09:10,459 --> 00:09:15,230
can also see that this little set of

00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:16,459
options here allows us to control some

00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:18,980
of the aspects of the cloud directly

00:09:16,459 --> 00:09:21,350
from the desktop so i could clear the

00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:23,480
cache or i could run update PHP whatever

00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:27,459
that means and that a little happen as a

00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:27,459
result of pushing the big shiny button

00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:39,680
so we'll sync up with a queer Club and

00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:42,620
I'll get a little window which is a look

00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:45,050
into get so if I don't want to learn get

00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:47,390
I just want to work with that within a

00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:50,330
friendly environment that's kind of safe

00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:52,850
and sanitized I can do that completely

00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:55,490
within dev desktop so i select all the

00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:57,410
files that i want to commit and if you

00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:59,000
understand version control this will be

00:09:57,410 --> 00:10:04,090
very straightforward but i'm going to

00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:06,380
add a message and say removed vandalism

00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:08,060
at the message so that means that the

00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:10,730
next developer that comes along to see

00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:12,290
whatever my changes will will have some

00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:16,010
idea when they look at the log about

00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:20,530
what I did so I had commit and this will

00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:24,710
synchronize my local code right up to

00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:26,870
development and as I see it desktops

00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:28,850
instructor that queer cloud to clear off

00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:31,430
the caches so that when I go and take

00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:33,800
the site to see that it's working we

00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:35,750
should see everything as near we're not

00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:41,480
we're not reading a cache copy of the of

00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:49,190
the page so time to test if I jump back

00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:53,090
into Safari let's have a look here I'm

00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:57,500
going to open up my development

00:10:53,090 --> 00:11:00,320
environment and so this is not exactly

00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:03,290
what I was hoping to see what I'm seeing

00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:09,170
is a white screen of death now that's

00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:14,990
not what I hope to see so let's just

00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:17,690
summarize we were at so I think locally

00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:20,270
with that we dip desktop edited the code

00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:23,240
that'll work then I push the code up to

00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:28,400
give for testing now that I've tested it

00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:30,170
I see a white screen of death so what I

00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:32,390
want to know is how can actually debug

00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:33,830
the site you know I it's not my local

00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:35,450
machine how am I going to find and read

00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:38,690
logs on this crazy big system that I

00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:40,310
don't know a lot about so having a vague

00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:40,710
memory of what i was told you in there

00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:42,440
clear

00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:45,330
boarding and having a poke around the

00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:47,340
documentation I remember that there's

00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:50,610
are something called log streaming which

00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:53,700
allows me to see the logs in real time

00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:55,260
on the site on evil environments and you

00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:56,610
know see if any of the requests that are

00:11:55,260 --> 00:12:01,680
making are actually kicking off errors

00:11:56,610 --> 00:12:04,320
or at least writing logs to the logs on

00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:11,280
the Acquia cloud so let me show you how

00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:13,250
that works ok so I'll do a little trick

00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:15,480
here now here's my white screen of death

00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:19,980
and i'm going to move that over to the

00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:22,650
right here's my area workflow and i'm

00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:27,650
going to move that over to the left now

00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:31,340
if I open up the logs it'll open up the

00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:33,660
UI that you saw and that little gift

00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:37,380
it's a little bit of squash but I think

00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:38,400
you get the idea and within that I'll be

00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:39,600
able to choose between those

00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:42,120
environments that I showed you in the

00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:44,700
workflow page before without development

00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:48,090
staging and production exactly as we

00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:50,370
discussed and I can also choose which

00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:51,930
lobs I want to show so i'm going to go

00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:53,760
ahead and choose all the ones that seem

00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:56,610
to look like they might give me your so

00:12:53,760 --> 00:13:00,510
patchy or PHP error and durable watchdog

00:12:56,610 --> 00:13:04,830
so if i go back to my white screen of

00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:07,230
death you know refresh the page let's

00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:09,660
hide there you can see that immediately

00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:13,320
we've got a PHP or so just to confirm

00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:16,650
that i'm going to fish that again n yes

00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:21,360
so we are seeing a PHP error so let me

00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:23,490
just dig a little bit deeper so you can

00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,200
see that with being able to see the log

00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:27,000
in real time as I've been viewing the

00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:29,250
site and we've got a message that's kind

00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:33,990
of useful so it says call to undefined

00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:38,990
function each which is in my template

00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:45,060
file and it happens to be on line two ok

00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:48,600
so I'm going to try and fix that so back

00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:52,170
to my template file on my local machine

00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:54,390
of course and you can see that on 12

00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:56,370
which is here it's got

00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:58,530
PHP code which I probably should have

00:13:56,370 --> 00:14:02,190
been more careful with and it doesn't

00:13:58,530 --> 00:14:05,790
look so good so let me remove that save

00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:09,480
it so i think i've fixed up that

00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:12,900
particular euro now while it was cool to

00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:14,280
be able to use get within desktop i'm

00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:17,040
pretty comfortable with get on the

00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:18,690
command line so now that i know that

00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:20,760
cloud does work with get i'm going to

00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:23,190
try and do that instead of working with

00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:25,950
in that little you I and give desktop so

00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:30,180
if I jump back into my give desktop

00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:33,960
environment and I click here I can open

00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:38,190
up a console so I'll just make that a

00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:42,230
little bigger great so straight away you

00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:44,640
can see that div desktop has been giving

00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:48,360
us all the environment variables that

00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:51,090
are required to work with Drupal on my

00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:55,140
local machine and I've also been changed

00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:57,870
into a directory locally which has the

00:14:55,140 --> 00:15:01,350
code that I've been working with so let

00:14:57,870 --> 00:15:03,120
me just check the status of that code so

00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:05,880
i can see that the particular template

00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:09,360
file I've been working on is modified so

00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:12,270
if I just check what's been modified yes

00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:14,100
that big minus with the red text is

00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:15,900
right that's what I want gone so let me

00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:24,350
commit that we're going to get a good

00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:24,350
number add that i'm going to say minus m

00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:36,070
fixed syntax error or some similarly

00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:39,190
youthful message so that's committed

00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:40,660
that's good and now because get of

00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:42,420
course is a distributed version control

00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:44,980
system I've actually got to push it up

00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:49,590
so that it's available on it click loud

00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:49,590
and tomorrow developers so good push and

00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:55,570
that is what we want to do it's been

00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:57,940
pushed up you can see that div desktop

00:15:55,570 --> 00:16:01,810
is set it all up for us so that I've got

00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:03,610
a distinct version control repository

00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:04,960
that's hosted by it clear and that's

00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:10,090
what I've been interacting with on the

00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:18,430
cloud coolies okay so if I jump back

00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:22,450
into Safari and look at my whip flow we

00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:24,010
should see that that code has been

00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:26,920
pushed up and we should be able to see

00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:28,860
that also in the log see just as I

00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:31,480
clipped into the air that has finished

00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:33,970
and that's my little commit that I've

00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:36,010
made and see that I fix the syntax error

00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:37,840
that's the message that I've given and

00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:39,310
if I click into the details I could see

00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:43,930
you know if anything had gone wrong

00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:47,980
during that coke commit the other thing

00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:49,690
i could do is look at notifications of

00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:51,220
other things that have been going on

00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:52,720
from other users but unfortunately cause

00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:56,410
everyone's in barcelona having a good

00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:58,720
time there's nothing it's just me so if

00:16:56,410 --> 00:17:00,930
i look at the give site is that look ok

00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,930
now

00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:09,699
yeah it appears ok there's no white

00:17:06,669 --> 00:17:16,150
screen of death there's no Rick Astley

00:17:09,699 --> 00:17:22,449
so now I'm feeling pretty good like I've

00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:24,490
done it so what have I done so I managed

00:17:22,449 --> 00:17:26,740
to view the logs on the environment real

00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:28,150
time that was handy then I fixed the

00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:31,750
issue locally which is a pretty simple

00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:33,370
fix and instead of committing via give

00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:34,780
this type they actually fixed it from

00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:36,510
the command line client which is

00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:39,789
something that I'm more comfortable with

00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:42,159
so now I've got the slightly more scary

00:17:39,789 --> 00:17:45,210
a job of actually deploying it under

00:17:42,159 --> 00:17:51,490
production and fixing the issue for good

00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:57,309
so let's look at how we might do that ok

00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:58,720
back to Safari just have to because of

00:17:57,309 --> 00:18:02,289
the way the screen set up here have to

00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:08,169
keep closing PowerPoint that's ok back

00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:10,780
to Safari ok so we're back to our little

00:18:08,169 --> 00:18:12,880
environment management console now

00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:14,890
within that we've spoken about give

00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:18,250
stage and prod within each of those

00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:20,470
we've got the code the files in the

00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:21,760
database now if you know Drupal you know

00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:24,370
that those are kind of the three main

00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:26,590
components that make up a site but

00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:28,870
because i'm going to do a deployment and

00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:30,820
because i want to be able to back out of

00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:32,770
it if something goes wrong i need a

00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:35,799
point in time back up that i can go back

00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:38,980
to if there's a major issue so how do i

00:18:35,799 --> 00:18:41,830
do that so if i click on this little

00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:43,840
down arrow here i have an option may

00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:45,730
have a few options but the one that I'm

00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:50,250
most interested in backing up the

00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:50,250
databases so do that

00:18:51,809 --> 00:18:57,490
they're get a list of all the databases

00:18:53,889 --> 00:19:02,380
we have deployed on this site and I'm

00:18:57,490 --> 00:19:04,059
going to bet those all up and again we

00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:07,120
get another job kicked off in the task

00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:08,620
list which will be logged and that I can

00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:12,760
see who did it and whether anything went

00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:14,500
wrong during their so once that's done

00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:17,649
what I'm going to do is actually deploy

00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:19,149
the code and currently the code that

00:19:17,649 --> 00:19:22,809
sitting on master is what I actually

00:19:19,149 --> 00:19:25,240
want to be in production so how do I do

00:19:22,809 --> 00:19:27,309
that so one of the ways that I can do

00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:28,809
that is by just simply dragging and

00:19:27,309 --> 00:19:32,590
dropping it from one environment to

00:19:28,809 --> 00:19:38,889
another so if I just grab the code from

00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:41,169
here drop it down on to production and

00:19:38,889 --> 00:19:42,820
click cloud or say to me hey I'd see

00:19:41,169 --> 00:19:44,679
that you're doing a deployment can you

00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:46,360
please provide a commit message because

00:19:44,679 --> 00:19:47,679
on and over what you're deploying in why

00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:49,389
so that when someone else comes along

00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:55,630
they've got some idea of why you did it

00:19:49,389 --> 00:20:03,429
so I'm going to say remove end ilysm at

00:19:55,630 --> 00:20:05,590
the point and as always this will kick

00:20:03,429 --> 00:20:06,850
off a job network loud and the code will

00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:10,240
be deployed you can see that the

00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:16,210
production has now got a state of the

00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:18,220
point and we've got the task running and

00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:20,139
of course I'll keep the backup so that

00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:26,679
means that if this does go wrong which I

00:20:20,139 --> 00:20:28,450
hope it doesn't I can back out of it so

00:20:26,679 --> 00:20:33,130
I would just wait for that to roll out

00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:34,929
we can look at the log great all done

00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:36,880
and so we have some detail there about

00:20:34,929 --> 00:20:39,130
what's going on I don't want to get too

00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:42,669
much into that but obviously you're

00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:44,909
taking care of business so now it's the

00:20:42,669 --> 00:20:47,409
moment of truth i am going to actually

00:20:44,909 --> 00:20:50,830
test it on production so i'm going to go

00:20:47,409 --> 00:20:55,690
to my little bookmark here open up

00:20:50,830 --> 00:21:00,500
production looks good

00:20:55,690 --> 00:21:04,190
no vandalism so happy days so let me

00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:09,020
just have a look and basket and what

00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:11,270
I've done for a minute so I deployed to

00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:15,050
prod using quickly tools and I have a

00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:17,090
backup just in case and fundamentally I

00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:20,000
got the role gone and the bug is fixed

00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:21,950
so I'm feeling pretty good the immediate

00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:25,570
need that my boss was needling me about

00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:27,860
as is out of the picture but what I

00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:29,540
don't want is to then be interrupted

00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:31,730
later on because my bosses found

00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:33,170
something else so I know that Edwards

00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:37,280
got some monitoring tools it's beginning

00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:39,320
to all come back to me so I'm going to

00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:40,790
go ahead and use those two chief

00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:42,380
assistance and whether there's any

00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:44,270
security issues which might lead to some

00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:45,680
more vandalism whether there's any

00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:48,200
performance issues which might lead to

00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:50,270
downtown or a slow site and then we do

00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:51,860
have a spike coming up next week so I

00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:57,980
want to make sure that we're prepared

00:21:51,860 --> 00:22:01,250
for that so a queer insight ok what is

00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:09,050
that let's have a look so if I close

00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:14,090
down the show again and jump back into

00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:16,970
Safari again ok so I'm back in my my

00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:19,220
interface and on the top here at the top

00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:22,430
level menu I am going to choose in the

00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:23,480
site and set of cloud sites working so I

00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:25,250
don't need to do any work on it

00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:28,490
immediately but i do want to check the

00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:31,190
monitoring to see what's happening so

00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:33,530
what this shows me is a bunch of metrics

00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:36,170
around and teeth around things like

00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:39,680
performance security and best practices

00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:42,470
and overall score is forty five percent

00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:44,600
which is not great and i can see that

00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:46,130
there's some brittle dirt issues here

00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:50,210
which I'm going to have to have a look

00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:51,710
at overall performance is not terrible

00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:53,300
fourteen out of twenty issues resolved

00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:56,030
but security and best practices aren't

00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:58,220
looking so good I can also see the

00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:59,720
uptime of the site over time and you can

00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:01,910
see there's a couple little blips there

00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:04,070
where we've deployed that white screen

00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:05,540
of death code but generally it's looking

00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:06,659
pretty good in it's actually working

00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:10,739
quite quickly under

00:23:06,659 --> 00:23:12,539
500 milliseconds for the most part so my

00:23:10,739 --> 00:23:14,820
developer leave me a few notes about how

00:23:12,539 --> 00:23:17,999
I might actually deal with security

00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:21,659
updates and I've also got some notes

00:23:17,999 --> 00:23:23,129
here their quiz provided basic to give

00:23:21,659 --> 00:23:25,739
me an overview of what the actual issue

00:23:23,129 --> 00:23:30,779
is and how to go about looking at

00:23:25,739 --> 00:23:32,399
solving that so let's have a look I need

00:23:30,779 --> 00:23:33,869
to do this and I've got these notes here

00:23:32,399 --> 00:23:38,639
that I'm just looking at from where

00:23:33,869 --> 00:23:39,869
developer so back to dev desktop now

00:23:38,639 --> 00:23:41,909
know the codes up to date because I've

00:23:39,869 --> 00:23:45,869
just deployed it and I'm going to open

00:23:41,909 --> 00:23:48,090
up another console and what I'm going to

00:23:45,869 --> 00:23:50,220
do is use this tool that my developers

00:23:48,090 --> 00:23:52,679
recommended called rush which is Drupal

00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:54,029
shell and from my interaction with that

00:23:52,679 --> 00:23:55,889
clear I know that they allow me to

00:23:54,029 --> 00:23:57,419
control the sights on it clear clout

00:23:55,889 --> 00:23:59,609
directly from the shower using Drudge

00:23:57,419 --> 00:24:02,099
using some things called aliases and

00:23:59,609 --> 00:24:04,340
that's the notes I have so first thing

00:24:02,099 --> 00:24:07,200
I'm going to do is check for our

00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:10,470
security updates with my little notes

00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:14,149
from my developer so here we go drush

00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:19,379
update it's not the DB the code please

00:24:14,149 --> 00:24:20,999
security only so this means that Russia

00:24:19,379 --> 00:24:24,539
is going to go away and look at

00:24:20,999 --> 00:24:29,009
drupal.org and check for which security

00:24:24,539 --> 00:24:30,960
updates are available sometimes this can

00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:32,519
take a little bit of time but I'd rather

00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,289
it took some time and got the right

00:24:32,519 --> 00:24:37,559
security updates then that work quickly

00:24:34,289 --> 00:24:39,929
and broke my site right but it does have

00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:43,999
to check every every module to make sure

00:24:39,929 --> 00:24:46,729
that there's something or not something

00:24:43,999 --> 00:24:51,570
so while that's running I might just

00:24:46,729 --> 00:24:55,409
create a new branch to work on so let me

00:24:51,570 --> 00:25:00,499
open up yet another sorry oh can I get

00:24:55,409 --> 00:25:00,499
another console

00:25:02,169 --> 00:25:08,799
and I am going to create a new brand so

00:25:05,889 --> 00:25:14,470
how'd I did it good check out minus B

00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:15,970
for branch security up the bits and I'm

00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:18,489
going to put a date on it to be a good

00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:26,350
citizen 20-foot so you can do September

00:25:18,489 --> 00:25:33,899
2015 great I'm just going to check on my

00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:37,239
updates still running ok cool ok so in

00:25:33,899 --> 00:25:40,299
the meantime I am going to push this

00:25:37,239 --> 00:25:41,859
branch up to our staging environment so

00:25:40,299 --> 00:25:46,179
that I've got the environment in a state

00:25:41,859 --> 00:25:49,119
that's ready for me to test cool so how

00:25:46,179 --> 00:25:51,249
do I do that now this is very much get

00:25:49,119 --> 00:25:54,850
stuff but we have full in native support

00:25:51,249 --> 00:26:00,220
for get on it quick clouds so let me

00:25:54,850 --> 00:26:03,129
push up this new branch ok so that's

00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:07,179
been pushed up to Acquia cloud my

00:26:03,129 --> 00:26:13,179
updates still running and if I jump back

00:26:07,179 --> 00:26:16,389
into the cloud I'm going to deploy that

00:26:13,179 --> 00:26:19,149
tag and to put it on to the staging so

00:26:16,389 --> 00:26:22,989
that I've got a place to test that code

00:26:19,149 --> 00:26:25,119
when it's ready so before when I

00:26:22,989 --> 00:26:27,369
deployed a sim pode into an environment

00:26:25,119 --> 00:26:29,320
I actually dragged up from Devon and to

00:26:27,369 --> 00:26:31,690
prod this time around I'm going to

00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:34,570
specify exactly which particular get

00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:36,820
branch I want to be deployed so in this

00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:40,210
case I've got this little that I like on

00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:42,070
here if I click that equi clouds going

00:26:40,210 --> 00:26:44,590
to read my get repository and see all of

00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:47,529
the bits and pieces that are available

00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:50,590
so I'm going to choose this security

00:26:47,529 --> 00:26:56,950
updates branch I'm going to just check

00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:59,139
that name yeah deploy that so that now

00:26:56,950 --> 00:27:00,429
when I push code onto that branch it's

00:26:59,139 --> 00:27:05,109
going to go directly into my staging

00:27:00,429 --> 00:27:06,850
environment well that's running i'm also

00:27:05,109 --> 00:27:09,909
going to grab the latest copy of the

00:27:06,850 --> 00:27:11,470
files in the database from production so

00:27:09,909 --> 00:27:13,509
that i know that when I'm testing it on

00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:14,000
testing against the most recent copy of

00:27:13,509 --> 00:27:17,450
coves

00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:19,340
sorry of content from production so in

00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:23,000
much the same way i deploy code i can

00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:28,580
deploy files and databases from

00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:31,540
production down to stage which is going

00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:34,130
to make that as close as possible to

00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:37,250
production which is obviously a lot

00:27:34,130 --> 00:27:38,990
safer for testing so hopefully my

00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:42,080
long-running update is finally finished

00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:44,270
at great so i can see in this

00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:48,080
case that I've got one two three four

00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:50,570
updates available and I can also see

00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:52,220
that Russia has given me a nice message

00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:53,500
that a backup is going to be cute so

00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:56,570
although i've got a version control

00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:58,130
better get out of jail free card i've

00:27:56,570 --> 00:28:01,790
also got a backup that Russia's keeping

00:27:58,130 --> 00:28:06,230
for me so that's handy so I say yes I

00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:09,260
want those and drush is going to go here

00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:11,690
download them apply them over the top of

00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:13,850
my existing modules in such a way that

00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:16,250
they apply cleanly and I'm not having to

00:28:13,850 --> 00:28:18,760
clean up garant files that have gone all

00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:18,760
over the place

00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:28,730
so once that's done I'm going to push it

00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:32,370
up to production and I'll be able to run

00:28:28,730 --> 00:28:34,889
some database updates cool so I've

00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:36,539
applied pretty cleanly the catch has

00:28:34,889 --> 00:28:40,049
been cleared out everything looks good

00:28:36,539 --> 00:28:41,960
so once again I'll do my get status and

00:28:40,049 --> 00:28:44,820
see lots of things have been changed

00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:47,010
over 500 files so I'm just going to go

00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:48,600
and add all of those because I can't be

00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:51,720
bothered for cleaning out exactly which

00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:57,240
ones you know I'm sure it's fine always

00:28:51,720 --> 00:29:00,809
around great get commit- em my message

00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:06,149
is going to be added security updates

00:29:00,809 --> 00:29:09,169
for modules all done and now wants I'm

00:29:06,149 --> 00:29:15,299
happy with that I'm going to push that

00:29:09,169 --> 00:29:18,269
right up great so that's been pushed to

00:29:15,299 --> 00:29:22,799
my security updates branch as you can

00:29:18,269 --> 00:29:26,100
see here and if I jump back into safari

00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:29,059
in refresh the workflow we should see

00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:29,059
that both been pushed out

00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:36,390
you can see that they're being pushed

00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:39,840
out right now and it's just completed as

00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:41,670
we've been watching so that's great but

00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:44,120
my notes from my developer also say that

00:29:41,670 --> 00:29:47,340
I need to run database updates because

00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:48,960
those code updates might have made

00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:51,510
changes to the database which need to

00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:53,130
run the real Tripoli thing so I'm going

00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:55,020
to go and do that now the other thing i

00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:57,030
know is that i can use rush to interact

00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:58,710
directly with Acquia cloud for my

00:29:57,030 --> 00:30:00,530
command line so i don't need to log into

00:29:58,710 --> 00:30:05,130
servers and so on i can just let a

00:30:00,530 --> 00:30:08,280
quasar tolling handle that so what do I

00:30:05,130 --> 00:30:10,140
want to do so I want to run drush it's

00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:16,309
the first thing but the next thing is

00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:19,650
the special name that I have which is my

00:30:16,309 --> 00:30:22,049
unique name for my environment so this

00:30:19,650 --> 00:30:23,880
is a unique name which I've got a notes

00:30:22,049 --> 00:30:25,380
which is referring to my particular

00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:28,440
environment Acquia cloud and it

00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:30,299
represents an alias file which contains

00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:32,580
all the ssh settings and so on to

00:30:30,299 --> 00:30:34,260
interact with that I could interact with

00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:36,330
the development environment by putting

00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:38,549
that or I could do staging by putting

00:30:36,330 --> 00:30:40,980
that suffix or I could do product we're

00:30:38,549 --> 00:30:43,830
putting that but I want to interact with

00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:45,480
staging so I'm going to do that and i'm

00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:50,669
going to say please update the database

00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:53,309
for me so if i do that this is going to

00:30:50,669 --> 00:30:55,590
connect into Acquia cloud and say oh

00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:58,380
great no database updates are required

00:30:55,590 --> 00:31:00,059
at all so I can be pretty confident that

00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:04,410
given that I use the most recent

00:31:00,059 --> 00:31:06,840
database from production and I pulled

00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:08,160
down pushed up the most recent code from

00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:10,080
the security updates that we're in a

00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:15,720
good shape that it's going to work on on

00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:18,480
prod hazards so what I'm going to do now

00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:20,700
as i am just going to do exactly the

00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:23,340
same thing in production it's going to

00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:25,710
be very obvious that for the next person

00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:27,450
who comes along that I've deployed some

00:31:25,710 --> 00:31:30,450
security updates on the twenty-second of

00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:32,820
September you know you know I can run

00:31:30,450 --> 00:31:37,860
those those database updates and exactly

00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:41,120
the same way that I did on staging so

00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:41,120
what have we done

00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:55,750
so we downloaded some security updates

00:31:50,430 --> 00:31:58,300
we tested in staging and we ran any

00:31:55,750 --> 00:32:00,190
required database updates that are on

00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:02,620
the accra environment as well as locally

00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:03,910
and so on and we also got it out to prod

00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:06,030
so I'm feeling pretty good about that

00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:08,320
that means that we're pretty up to date

00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:10,990
and I feel like I might be able to leave

00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:13,800
on time today but the other thing that

00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:15,550
was happening in the and that our

00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:17,320
insight report is that there were

00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:20,050
outstanding performance issues which i

00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:22,420
don't really am not as confident on how

00:32:20,050 --> 00:32:27,490
to deal with so what I'm going to do is

00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:29,710
talk tak we're support all right there a

00:32:27,490 --> 00:32:31,570
big team of Tripoli people who know how

00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:35,890
to work with Drupal a lot better than I

00:32:31,570 --> 00:32:38,260
do there's a lot of them they're

00:32:35,890 --> 00:32:40,180
available twenty-four-seven they speak a

00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:42,190
lot of languages they're spread across

00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:44,500
four continents and they've got about

00:32:42,190 --> 00:32:47,920
250 plus years more experience with

00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:49,870
Drupal than I have so how do I actually

00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:55,360
deal with them how do I get them to help

00:32:49,870 --> 00:32:59,650
me let's give that a shot once again

00:32:55,360 --> 00:33:01,810
jump in back into Safari this time I'm

00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:04,150
going to click on the help link which is

00:33:01,810 --> 00:33:13,360
going to give me access into the support

00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:16,270
ticketing system so i want to create a

00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:20,890
new support ticket so i'm going to click

00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:23,410
the big orange button and i am going to

00:33:20,890 --> 00:33:25,630
say that it is a drupal application

00:33:23,410 --> 00:33:27,280
support issue as opposed to say a

00:33:25,630 --> 00:33:29,620
platform issue or another type of this

00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:31,990
year and i'm going to say the agency's

00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:34,150
hi so we do have a spike coming up that

00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:36,250
we know is likely to promote a lot of

00:33:34,150 --> 00:33:38,260
load on the server but it's not critical

00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:40,500
my sites not down everything still

00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:45,000
working but it is high you didn't see so

00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:49,710
let me just write a little summary here

00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:49,710
so go to spike expected this weekend and

00:33:49,890 --> 00:33:56,410
we have a big spike in traffic expected

00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:57,640
this weekend in my dears are away inside

00:33:56,410 --> 00:34:00,320
is reporting that there are some

00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:05,029
performance issues in a married

00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:07,399
that we went to play could you help okay

00:34:05,029 --> 00:34:09,980
so this is where as if I'm not wearing

00:34:07,399 --> 00:34:12,440
enough equity stuff already I put on the

00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:17,480
stylish hat and I suddenly become a

00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:20,359
queer support staff alright so let's

00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:22,520
just clear off all this stuff so I'm

00:34:20,359 --> 00:34:27,649
they're queer support guy I have

00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:32,629
received this ticket and I want to help

00:34:27,649 --> 00:34:34,250
us go out so what do I do so the first

00:34:32,629 --> 00:34:36,200
thing that we should know about air

00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:38,929
clear that's what stuff is that they

00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:41,000
have access to customer sites and they

00:34:38,929 --> 00:34:43,460
have full access to both the code and

00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:45,409
the actual running application so I've

00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:48,649
see that's a very sensitive thing to

00:34:45,409 --> 00:34:50,300
have the ability to do so what we need

00:34:48,649 --> 00:34:52,040
is some kind of way of centrally

00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:53,750
managing that and what we do at Clara's

00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:55,220
have a thing called Bastian server which

00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:57,500
means that all of our authentication

00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:59,480
goes through a group of central servers

00:34:57,500 --> 00:35:00,890
that are centrally managed so we log in

00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:03,290
to that server with three factor

00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:05,240
authentication and then should we need

00:35:03,290 --> 00:35:06,530
to remove rights from someone or give

00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:08,119
rights to someone we can do that from

00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:11,540
one place in situ having to chase them

00:35:08,119 --> 00:35:13,819
all across the internet so as equity

00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:16,880
support i'm going to log into that i'm

00:35:13,819 --> 00:35:23,180
going to put on my password i'm going to

00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:24,619
generate the one time token and once

00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:27,200
that's done I should get a nice message

00:35:24,619 --> 00:35:29,000
saying I'm logged in and the best in

00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:31,190
connection is active so that means I'm

00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:35,650
modern to a server somewhere in America

00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:37,910
which is managing my authentication so

00:35:35,650 --> 00:35:39,410
what i could do is that clear support is

00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:42,410
I could go into insight and look through

00:35:39,410 --> 00:35:43,940
the report directly but because we kind

00:35:42,410 --> 00:35:48,950
of see the stuff a lot of the time and

00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:50,030
because you know we we know how to fix a

00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:51,920
lot of these issues directly without

00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:53,720
having to kind of reference the detailer

00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:57,740
and so I can just run it from the local

00:35:53,720 --> 00:36:00,260
machine so what I'm going to do is run I

00:35:57,740 --> 00:36:03,200
just clear that out the air clear

00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:07,480
hosting toolkit and if i can remember

00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:16,980
against DC barcelona d7 demo

00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:20,260
let me just get the name here at one dot

00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:27,190
production and I am going to run a

00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:28,840
lightweight audit so keep that off whom

00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:30,730
this is going to go through and do

00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:32,650
what's called static analysis of the

00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:34,690
site which means it's going to check a

00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:36,100
lot of the code and the configuration

00:36:34,690 --> 00:36:39,220
with that actually bootstrap in the

00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:43,240
application so you can see what we have

00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:44,770
here is a very quick and easy to scan

00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:46,720
report which shows the things that are

00:36:44,770 --> 00:36:49,660
looking good on the site and the things

00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:51,460
that are not looking so good so this is

00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:53,230
fundamentally the same data that's an

00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:57,550
insight is presented in a different way

00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:59,800
but what I could do exactly suppose I

00:36:57,550 --> 00:37:03,040
could go back to the client and say hey

00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:05,200
these are these particular issues you

00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:07,690
should go ahead and fix them or we can

00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:08,710
just fix the mouse else directly so it

00:37:07,690 --> 00:37:11,560
really depends on the clients

00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:13,450
preferences but you know we can dig in

00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:15,220
and find these very common issues that

00:37:13,450 --> 00:37:17,440
we see quite easily so we have a lot of

00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:20,380
tulle in it like this this is very

00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:24,070
simple one to show sometimes the issues

00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:25,660
aren't quite as simple you know this is

00:37:24,070 --> 00:37:27,280
stuff that you can very quickly see and

00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:29,950
very quickly fixed sometimes we need to

00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:32,310
dig a lot deeper into customer code to

00:37:29,950 --> 00:37:36,010
figure out what's slowing things down or

00:37:32,310 --> 00:37:38,470
limiting scalability so on so one of the

00:37:36,010 --> 00:37:42,160
things that we offer for a lot of their

00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:44,320
customers is the option to use XH prof

00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:46,840
now if you haven't heard of excited

00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:49,270
profits at application performance

00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:50,680
monitoring tool that was actually

00:37:49,270 --> 00:37:55,690
written by facebook because i use a lot

00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:57,820
of PHP and it digs right down into your

00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:59,830
code and analyzes that edit function

00:37:57,820 --> 00:38:01,420
levels so this is not for real wet clear

00:37:59,830 --> 00:38:03,160
customers so it's only of those who want

00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:06,310
to have it enabled but in this

00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:11,080
particular case this customer has had

00:38:06,310 --> 00:38:13,540
enabled so I can click in and I can see

00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:15,550
a summary of performance right down to

00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:17,050
the function level you can see where

00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:20,350
some of the times being spent in

00:38:17,050 --> 00:38:21,160
memcache and PHP in my sequel and if I

00:38:20,350 --> 00:38:25,270
wanted to I could

00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:28,030
big right down to very fine grain level

00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:29,859
and I'm not going to give a big demo on

00:38:28,030 --> 00:38:31,119
how to use excess profit because I don't

00:38:29,859 --> 00:38:34,210
really know how to use it that well

00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:37,930
myself and it's very competent but I can

00:38:34,210 --> 00:38:40,869
dig further and further down into every

00:38:37,930 --> 00:38:42,190
single function and see how much time

00:38:40,869 --> 00:38:44,859
they're taking how much memory they're

00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:46,299
using and so on and that's very useful

00:38:44,859 --> 00:38:47,829
if there's something that particular

00:38:46,299 --> 00:38:52,329
page that seems to be running for a very

00:38:47,829 --> 00:38:54,460
long time we also actually offer to all

00:38:52,329 --> 00:38:57,280
of our customers new rally which is

00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:59,829
effectively the same thing but it's just

00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:03,309
a little bit friendlier and so again

00:38:59,829 --> 00:39:05,230
customers don't have to have it but they

00:39:03,309 --> 00:39:07,270
might want to have it emits as the case

00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:10,210
of enabling it on the echo environment

00:39:07,270 --> 00:39:12,190
you can see that as a queer support

00:39:10,210 --> 00:39:16,150
staff I have access to a lot of those

00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:19,750
particular sites so for example Drupal

00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:21,940
com I can dig in and see exactly the

00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:23,740
same thing so it's exactly the same

00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:27,309
model of being able to dig down to the

00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:29,559
function level cool so that's code

00:39:27,309 --> 00:39:31,779
analysis the last kind of thing i want

00:39:29,559 --> 00:39:34,210
to show you that equius support do as I

00:39:31,779 --> 00:39:37,960
and their support role is to look more

00:39:34,210 --> 00:39:40,089
at the server the underlying service so

00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:44,020
i'm just going to clear that one out and

00:39:40,089 --> 00:39:45,970
i am now going to obviously that was a

00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:48,849
little shortcut i'm going to run a

00:39:45,970 --> 00:39:52,150
report against the server that is

00:39:48,849 --> 00:39:54,220
running the production site for the last

00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:55,420
week so i can see that a time frame in

00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:59,650
this case I'm just going to do the last

00:39:55,420 --> 00:40:01,299
week so if i run that we will see a

00:39:59,650 --> 00:40:03,549
report open up which will give us very

00:40:01,299 --> 00:40:05,319
fine-grained detail of how each

00:40:03,549 --> 00:40:08,920
particular server and the stack is

00:40:05,319 --> 00:40:11,140
running and that is all fed from Ned

00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:14,920
Yost data which is kept centrally in our

00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:16,900
monitoring tools but this is just put

00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:19,420
into a way that makes sense for a

00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:22,029
customer to be out of read as opposed to

00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:23,920
a long stream of logs so we summarize

00:40:22,029 --> 00:40:27,130
the hardware's in this case is to

00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:29,440
balances in a single server and as we

00:40:27,130 --> 00:40:33,430
see we can dig into particular features

00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:34,450
cpu load memory use and so on and so all

00:40:33,430 --> 00:40:36,940
of the things i'm showing

00:40:34,450 --> 00:40:38,770
a very detailed and complex but that's

00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:41,020
part of the service that we like to

00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:52,150
provide should we need to dig into this

00:40:41,020 --> 00:41:01,000
level of detail cool okay so we are are

00:40:52,150 --> 00:41:02,650
we so what had support handled and I'm

00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:07,000
going to head off and go back to being a

00:41:02,650 --> 00:41:08,530
punter and not a support staff member so

00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,690
what does support do so we ordered that

00:41:08,530 --> 00:41:13,060
the config and the code to make sure

00:41:10,690 --> 00:41:16,930
that things were performing correctly so

00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:19,780
we did a light audit excuse me we also

00:41:16,930 --> 00:41:24,940
looked at server stats and we go for a

00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:27,220
deep with XH prof support was also able

00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:28,630
to notify the cloud operations team who

00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:29,980
haven't really spoken about but the

00:41:28,630 --> 00:41:32,920
other kind of back in people who are

00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:34,960
monitoring all of the servers in our and

00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:36,730
our cloud and they will know now that

00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:38,170
there's a spike coming up so should they

00:41:36,730 --> 00:41:40,000
see a whole lot of traffic suddenly

00:41:38,170 --> 00:41:41,950
coming out of nowhere they know it's not

00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,060
a DDoS attack or something like that so

00:41:41,950 --> 00:41:45,040
it just gives them a little bit of extra

00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:47,319
context for sure they need to spin up

00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:50,020
additional servers or react and another

00:41:47,319 --> 00:41:52,270
way to cope with that spike and that

00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:55,930
means that i can feel like my mind as it

00:41:52,270 --> 00:41:57,099
is there's an upcoming spike I don't

00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:59,380
need to particularly worried about it

00:41:57,099 --> 00:42:06,670
myself I'm not directly responsible for

00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:09,250
it I've got support so my boss is happy

00:42:06,670 --> 00:42:12,280
he says it's not bad he's making this

00:42:09,250 --> 00:42:13,720
face and even though it's Thursday

00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:18,790
afternoon he's still asking me about

00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:20,650
Drupal 8 he's a pain so what do I want

00:42:18,790 --> 00:42:22,089
to say about a clear and Drupal 8 so

00:42:20,650 --> 00:42:24,369
first thing is that we're absolutely

00:42:22,089 --> 00:42:28,180
ready drupal 8 everything that you saw

00:42:24,369 --> 00:42:29,760
here is supported and Drupal 8 including

00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:32,530
you know in sight at the drudge

00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:37,119
instrumentation and so on if I jump back

00:42:32,530 --> 00:42:39,160
into my developer tools might give

00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:43,540
desktop you can see I've actually got

00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:46,840
two sites here at d7 site and I've also

00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:50,320
got a d8 site

00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:54,280
I can open up the workflow for that by

00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:55,360
clicking this button hopefully I haven't

00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:59,560
been logged out because I'm on a

00:42:55,360 --> 00:43:05,470
different network no it's the wrong we

00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:08,680
just ocean move da and you can see

00:43:05,470 --> 00:43:12,240
exactly as we had with the d7 I've got a

00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:14,680
DA and exactly the same instrumentation

00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:16,600
but with additional support for some da

00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:20,910
features so you can install the eighth

00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:23,740
and go go for it show you that running

00:43:20,910 --> 00:43:28,660
we have a nice d8 so I'm all logged in

00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:31,780
I've got the nice d 8 interface and I'm

00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:35,110
happy days so as a quick example let me

00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:37,180
show you what I might do as you may or

00:43:35,110 --> 00:43:40,420
may not know da it's not quite out yet

00:43:37,180 --> 00:43:43,840
so what I want to do is install the

00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:45,490
developer module for Drupal 8 because

00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:47,260
that's something I could use to help me

00:43:45,490 --> 00:43:50,110
to debug mode replayed site which is

00:43:47,260 --> 00:43:52,150
still in development and still relying

00:43:50,110 --> 00:43:54,610
on the waiting on the release candidate

00:43:52,150 --> 00:43:56,140
to come out so i'm going to use rush

00:43:54,610 --> 00:44:05,050
fusion 8 this time and i'm going to

00:43:56,140 --> 00:44:08,650
download the develop module so i can see

00:44:05,050 --> 00:44:10,180
that that's been downloaded and I've

00:44:08,650 --> 00:44:12,460
been taught which path and which modules

00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:14,290
are available I'm going to create a new

00:44:12,460 --> 00:44:18,700
branch so I'm going to go get check out

00:44:14,290 --> 00:44:21,640
minus B devel 4 d8 or something not the

00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:23,920
best name but they will do I'm going to

00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:28,770
check the status you know I'm going to

00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:37,530
add in the new module well how I ok

00:44:28,770 --> 00:44:37,530
commit- am headed develop

00:44:38,270 --> 00:44:44,730
push that up probably be taught to go

00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:50,670
away I have been so I'm going to set the

00:44:44,730 --> 00:44:54,600
new branch on Acquia cloud and again we

00:44:50,670 --> 00:44:59,790
pushed out now and we're enabled no

00:44:54,600 --> 00:45:05,120
problem so if I jump back into my

00:44:59,790 --> 00:45:13,950
workflow and exactly the same way I can

00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:18,360
deploy develop a d8 hit deploy and out

00:45:13,950 --> 00:45:20,940
we go so we support drush 8 on the

00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:21,960
actual cloud environment as well a lot

00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:24,960
of the stuff I've been doing here is

00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:29,790
local but we have full support for that

00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:35,730
if I was then too for example enable the

00:45:29,790 --> 00:45:37,170
module people I'll do it in the Drupal 8

00:45:35,730 --> 00:45:42,060
site to show you actually I think there

00:45:37,170 --> 00:45:51,810
might be better open up the site go to

00:45:42,060 --> 00:45:55,280
extend and cetra devel when enabled eval

00:45:51,810 --> 00:45:55,280
in this nice little module

00:46:02,170 --> 00:46:08,940
and it will be installed within triple-a

00:46:05,770 --> 00:46:08,940
and really fit for use

00:46:13,650 --> 00:46:19,230
and that's all done I didn't go back i

00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:26,849
can start mucking around with it and

00:46:19,230 --> 00:46:28,500
breaking things and there's develop your

00:46:26,849 --> 00:46:35,059
views that Drupal 7 it's much the same

00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:42,589
thing but obviously for Drew blame great

00:46:35,059 --> 00:46:45,180
so to conclude what have we done and I

00:46:42,589 --> 00:46:48,270
will take questions just turn a second

00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:50,660
after I've gone through this so utilize

00:46:48,270 --> 00:46:54,539
desktop we managed to fix an error there

00:46:50,660 --> 00:46:58,020
not only was there the bad vandalism but

00:46:54,539 --> 00:46:59,430
we also fixed an error and syntax by

00:46:58,020 --> 00:47:03,480
reading the logs in real time then

00:46:59,430 --> 00:47:05,010
deployment to prod we used a clear toast

00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:08,309
and wanted to site performance and

00:47:05,010 --> 00:47:10,020
configuration then I was able to install

00:47:08,309 --> 00:47:11,730
the security updates deploy and run the

00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:14,220
database updates with drush on it clear

00:47:11,730 --> 00:47:15,690
cloud directly I've also been able to

00:47:14,220 --> 00:47:17,520
get in touch with that equally support

00:47:15,690 --> 00:47:19,589
who held with the performance and

00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:24,059
scaling so I have got that handled for

00:47:19,589 --> 00:47:26,430
me which means that i can go away to

00:47:24,059 --> 00:47:28,890
Sigma cinema and listen to Goldie

00:47:26,430 --> 00:47:35,190
dropping some metal hits tracks and have

00:47:28,890 --> 00:47:39,630
a good time and be relaxed and that is

00:47:35,190 --> 00:47:41,910
it but if you do have any questions I'm

00:47:39,630 --> 00:47:43,410
happy to take them we've also got David

00:47:41,910 --> 00:47:47,400
hear from our products team who is

00:47:43,410 --> 00:47:49,710
involved in some of the future work that

00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:51,930
we're doing in the cloud generally but

00:47:49,710 --> 00:47:53,220
specifically also around Roopa late so

00:47:51,930 --> 00:47:58,490
if you do have any questions feel free

00:47:53,220 --> 00:48:04,580
to ask sure

00:47:58,490 --> 00:48:04,580
to having some problem with demo

00:48:07,150 --> 00:48:13,030
is that what my missing words that are

00:48:16,990 --> 00:48:21,680
so the question was around to pointing

00:48:19,579 --> 00:48:23,150
Drupal 8 and 2 Acquia cloud and having

00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:35,480
some issues with that via dev desktop

00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:41,450
did you want it but yeah I wear that if

00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:43,940
you I definitely will support I think at

00:48:41,450 --> 00:48:45,859
this point because it's not releasing at

00:48:43,940 --> 00:48:51,910
me because a few things that still need

00:48:45,859 --> 00:48:51,910
to be done like to make things work

00:48:53,470 --> 00:48:57,619
if you are having particular troubles

00:48:56,119 --> 00:48:58,819
like that feel free to come down to the

00:48:57,619 --> 00:49:03,859

much just

00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:40,800
it's quite yeah that's quite a bit salir

00:49:37,710 --> 00:49:42,240
con without any flashing you stuff

00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:48,590
that's quite a bad on difficult

00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:48,590
geometrical okay yeah

00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:36,130

00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:36,130
the master

00:50:45,710 --> 00:50:50,540
typically we had more with you

00:51:11,999 --> 00:51:20,100
fortunately

00:51:13,870 --> 00:51:20,100
working on the site with the realization

00:51:37,579 --> 00:51:46,519
on the back you see what our service

00:51:41,489 --> 00:51:46,519
your msdn to get

00:51:51,739 --> 00:52:01,639
my question is desktop itself is there a

00:51:57,869 --> 00:52:01,639
better method to create a branch

00:54:36,460 --> 00:54:48,520
this actually this is what were you but

00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:48,520
if you want to

00:55:14,950 --> 00:55:25,940
what is that accelerate monograms to

00:55:19,010 --> 00:55:28,130
hire men so we do yeah Tim it time

00:55:25,940 --> 00:55:30,370
actually just done that we only have

00:55:28,130 --> 00:55:30,370
more

00:55:54,490 --> 00:56:03,320
yeah I don't know where that sometimes I

00:55:58,460 --> 00:56:06,080
never know where the lawyer type of it

00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:08,870
yeah sorry you would know about any dev

00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:11,750
tools is being robot that desktop this

00:56:08,870 --> 00:56:14,810
game or relatives that's great it's like

00:56:11,750 --> 00:56:17,560
an entry level drug you know triple

00:56:14,810 --> 00:56:21,470
canvases come out with actually in turn

00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:25,430
x12 and red patent support so

00:56:21,470 --> 00:56:28,040
essentially anything you want and and

00:56:25,430 --> 00:56:29,930
then import your up quia dropship

00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:33,250
entrances and have a really great

00:56:29,930 --> 00:56:33,250
developer experience in there as well
