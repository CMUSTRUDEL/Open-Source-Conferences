Title: DrupalCon Barcelona 2015: Fundamentals of Front-End Ops
Publication date: 2015-09-22
Playlist: DrupalCon Barcelona - September 2015
Description: 
	Front-end paradigms are shifting fast, and among the trends singled out are task automation, painless dependency management, and quicker testing. Front-end ops, a term promulgated by Alex Sexton, deals with the synthesis of all of these responsibilities and others that front-end developers today face. We'll talk about a variety of different options available for FEDs to work efficiently and iteratively, such as Yeoman, Grunt, Gulp, Bower, and other lesser-known projects.

Here's what we'll cover:

Why ops? Automation generates consistency
Why front-end ops? Roles, rationales, workflow
Getting started: Scaffolding and setup
Automation: Grunt and Gulp
Linting: Coding standards
CSS: Preprocessing and aggregation
JavaScript: Minification and concatenation
CSS regressions
Testing rendering engines and devices (GhostLab)
Performance testing
Developer tools for debugging
This session assumes some familiarity with the command line.

This is an updated version of a session presented at NYCCamp 2015 and DrupalCamp New Jersey 2015.
