Title: DrupalCon Barcelona 2015: Drupal 8 theming
Publication date: 2015-09-22
Playlist: DrupalCon Barcelona - September 2015
Description: 
	Full disclosure: this session was given at DrupalCon in LA, the session will be updated & modified to match the state of Drupal8 in Barcelona (RC1 i hope) - slides are added from LA as well to give the track chair an idea of the session

Drupal 8 has many new exciting features, but none are as radical or as needed as the changes made to the theme system*!

For 10 years Drupal's front end was design and built by developers that tried their very best to figure out what the front end needed; the lack of dedicated front-enders in core; resulted in front end architecture that was "less than ideal" for the challenges that the front end has faced for the last 5 years.

Drupal 8 and twig changed it all!

A complete overhaul of the theme system started 3 years ago - PHPtemplate is now out the door, the twig template system is implemented, and most importantly, the core idea of how the front end is build has done a 180° from how Drupal 7 handled theming.

This means:

No more divitis
No more Class soup
No more of Drupal's standard markup and classes
No more yelling at the markup and not knowing where stuff came from
No more using regex for modify a CSS class!
Such a dramatic change would normally cause panic is a time for celebration.

The session will give you a solid understanding of the key concepts of Drupal 8 theming, as a themer.

We will cover:

The structure of a Drupal 8 theme
Classy and Stark themes (and  what it means for the future of theming)
Base themes - what happened
Debugging and looking for markup
How {{ twig }} works from a CSS/HTML coders perspective (how to build a theme)
What to tell your developers about theming
CSS file structure and how M.A.T. works
JS and how to drop 32K
This session is created with the themer / front-ender / html-css designer  in mind, so a maximum of 3 lines of PHP will be shown in this session.

*Yes I know that a lot of “big things came into d8” that weren't front end related ;)

00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:07,670
booing okay fair enough no we're very

00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:09,020
sorry for that yeah right um but no come

00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:11,030

00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:13,580
get that fixed getting that punched

00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:15,530
in and and getting us you want getting

00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:17,270
out so I'm going to start with talk

00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:19,430
about one of my favorite topics which is

00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:21,470
Stockholm Syndrome Stockholm Syndrome is

00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:23,780
nothing to do with the Swedish Chef or

00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:25,820
ikea stockholm syndrome is what happens

00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:27,470
to people who have been captured for a

00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:30,620
long time and suddenly begin to

00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:32,450
sympathize with the prison guards so

00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:35,120
this is Drupal 7 markup and I've heard

00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:37,250
the argument that you know delicious

00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,780
it's a feature I've heard that from

00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:40,730
front end us it's a feature it's good i

00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:42,590
have all these classes all these diff so

00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:44,210
i can pinpoint everything in it is

00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:46,670
perfectly okay with five thousand lines

00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:48,530
of code in your PHP template file though

00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:51,410
the class soup is another feature that

00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:53,240
is all parts of Stockholm Syndrome and

00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:55,730
I'm here to drag us all out of it so

00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:56,960
let's just go like no more test of how

00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:58,790
no more of that stuff what we're going

00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:00,530
to go this jubilate so what are we done

00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:03,140
well we're going to do to you theme

00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:06,230
engine so hello trick well and good by

00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:08,390
PHP template and because basically what

00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:11,090
we've done is with self-esteem functions

00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:13,700
and and now everything is turning out to

00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:15,680
be a template and buy a template i mean

00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:18,290
there's going to be a lot of templates

00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:20,420
and but basically what we're doing is

00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:22,730
we're taking the control of markup and

00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:24,560
CSS ripping that out of modules and

00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:26,180
putting it to the theme where it should

00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,950
live so the files and the file

00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:29,810
structures you live in and working on a

00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:31,550
day-to-day basis that's where it's going

00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:33,830
to be at that's the whole point of it so

00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:36,980
i have one little exercise we need to do

00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:38,720
now we need to unlearn PHP template I'm

00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:41,630
ready for that okay I get it all to

00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:44,030
close your eyes I can see you guys come

00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:45,530
close them so now think about all the

00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:48,560
awesome stuff you have done in PHP

00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:50,209
template yeah I know it's hard to figure

00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,280
out anything it's kind of like

00:03:50,209 --> 00:03:54,470
completely empty okay open the eyes

00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:57,290
again thank you guys so now you're ready

00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:58,820
for this this is trick everything you

00:03:57,290 --> 00:04:00,110
have used to do you don't you're not

00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:02,060
going to do that anymore when you work

00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:04,040
come up to Drupal 8 it's all going to be

00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:06,200
gone so twig is a modern template

00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:08,000
language yada yada yada yada yadi old is

00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:10,580
fine and fancy stuff built for the

00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,140
symphony guys and so forth so and it's

00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:14,090
easy to learn how easy about this easy

00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:15,170
first line up there that's a variable

00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:16,729
it's going to print out available the

00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:18,950
second line is going to be stuff that's

00:04:16,729 --> 00:04:21,350
coming it out and the third one which is

00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:23,000
where you put functionality and that's

00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:25,940
what you need to know you now know trick

00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,130
array um the other thing you're going to

00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:29,870
do with that is bearable chillin how do

00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:31,789
you get your available well in 207 you

00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:34,100
can see the upper line there that's how

00:04:31,789 --> 00:04:35,720
you kind of God you had to remember when

00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:38,000
was there as Syria where is there the

00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:40,539
hunt the undefined language not the

00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:44,330
music rhythm phone from Germany you

00:04:40,539 --> 00:04:46,820
George we have removed that and now you

00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:48,890
drill into adjust with the dot so you

00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:51,200
can actually go find your data without

00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:53,780
you know sacrificing a little child in

00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:55,430
the moonshine and the other thing we

00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:57,500
have now is we have functions functions

00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:59,720
that you can put up on top of your

00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:02,270
available so you have available you put

00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:04,220
in a pipe and you ask it to do something

00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:07,070
here like make it pretty and they'll do

00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:09,260
it now it could also be a function like

00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:10,550
uppercase this way this is how I make my

00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:13,330
name our bouquets your pipe and

00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:15,680
uppercase translate have changed a lot

00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:17,960
translate used to be we can outdo that

00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:20,720
as a function with a with a pipe t all

00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:22,310
you can actually use the chance function

00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,169
and you wrap your whole string in that

00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:26,090
so you can put pebbles and everything in

00:05:24,169 --> 00:05:27,740
there and just print it all out and drew

00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:29,030
will takes care of the rest that's kind

00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:30,530
of one of the things where we usually do

00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:31,930
a lot of mistakes and rupal seven

00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:34,520
because it's such a pain in the ass

00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:36,620
control function would be like know if

00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:38,570
the person is somebody and do something

00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:40,430
about that that would be that and that

00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:41,960
although escape thing it's something

00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:43,610
which security I don't know what we're

00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:45,440
going to use that for but you know if

00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:47,599
you if you really need to have your data

00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,729
roll out you can use a pipe raw and you

00:05:47,599 --> 00:05:53,000
can get it out that way they are poo

00:05:49,729 --> 00:05:54,890
don't do that so the other thing you can

00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,900
do is inside of the template we can

00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:58,039
create variables so we have variables

00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:59,450
that comes in but you can create your

00:05:58,039 --> 00:06:00,500
own babbles that you need them we're

00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:02,360
going to see you later on when we begin

00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:04,550
to play with classes and CSS how we can

00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:08,000
do that so basically you define

00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:10,190
available and you do a set here I set my

00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,810
purple foo and I give the valuable bar

00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:13,910
and then I'm going to print it out and

00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:15,139
that's it that's all you kind of

00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:17,510
actually need to know about Troy

00:06:15,139 --> 00:06:20,310
basically to get into the engine work

00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:21,900
biggest issue we had got in was actually

00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:23,850
new theme classy because we have

00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:25,950
separated all the markup out of Drupal

00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:28,470
core and into a theme that can't be in

00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:30,210
one of the biggest change so in Google 7

00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:32,970
it went something like this though you

00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:34,890
have you know all the mark-up gets

00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:36,420
created directly from Drupal core and it

00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:37,770
got pushed out to a theme and then you

00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:40,080
can try to work with it what we're doing

00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:41,250
now instead is we're piping that all of

00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,740
the commands while all the variables

00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:45,720
piping them through a theme classy and

00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:47,880
then we put out all the all the markup

00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:50,250
all the classes or the CSS it's going

00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:52,320
that way instead um so that means that

00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:54,270
now you're going to use a base theme and

00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:56,580
forget about what you know about base

00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:59,490
themes in Drupal 7 because it's not it's

00:06:56,580 --> 00:07:01,650
not the same thing anymore you have

00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:03,840
available we sent that to our base lee

00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:06,300
in which is classy and that Daniel 7 and

00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:08,880
stock will inherit from that and then

00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:10,680
work on it's all basic markup is acting

00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:12,330
now living in classy so the markup that

00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,530
you want to use just out of the box

00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:14,910
because you don't want to write any

00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:17,010
templates that's what you're going to do

00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:18,660
that um so if you have your own theme

00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:21,120
you need to kind of decide what do I

00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:22,770
want to do are you kind of a narrative

00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,300
John tender like me you want to decide

00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:26,520
everything and change everything on the

00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:27,750
go well then you just don't define in

00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:29,820
the base theme if you want to have

00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:31,650
google basic markup and class names and

00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:33,360
stuff you can actually use to develop on

00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:35,460
well then you're gonna use classy

00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,229
because daddy's trubel's basic themes

00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:39,120
and that's what to know about there so

00:07:37,229 --> 00:07:40,500
you know no place seem to find you're

00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,840
going to get an empty div and that's it

00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:44,400
and that is by to just buy the sign it

00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:46,500
is still my favorite issue when we

00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,390
cleaned up the menu and somebody wind

00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:55,050
about there was no menu class and kind

00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:56,340
of like it's a feature the thing is the

00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:58,320
other thing you're going to be really

00:07:56,340 --> 00:08:00,000
maybe going to be a little bit tired of

00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:02,100
so in two years when we have you know

00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,140
six thousand template files nephew theme

00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:05,970
somebody's going to come yell at Lowry

00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:08,160
for designing this the theme system and

00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:10,140
why is there so many template files that

00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,729
is how it's built I'm sorry for that

00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:15,780
already and just gonna put it out there

00:08:11,729 --> 00:08:17,729
so the thing is that you need to define

00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:19,500
the Paisley we just remember that all if

00:08:17,729 --> 00:08:21,570
you don't define anything you're not

00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:23,610
going to get anything that is by T for

00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:25,620
that is how we have designed to Google

00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:27,930
should not put anything out unless you

00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:29,490
asked it to so when you say hey I'm

00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:32,130
going to use classy I'm actually

00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:33,990
use that and there's been one question

00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:36,149
people could not figure out how come I'm

00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:38,700
the maintainer of the classy theme yes

00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:40,169
if you know anything out to Google 7 you

00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:41,360
have to send and i did a theme called

00:08:40,169 --> 00:08:43,529
the mothership which is pretty much a

00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,089
flaming fire hose through the drupal

00:08:43,529 --> 00:08:47,370
theme system cleaning everything up and

00:08:45,089 --> 00:08:49,230
now in tubal 7 we have class ii which is

00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:51,330
kind of same thing you sent and we have

00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:54,330
to recall which kind of have nothing in

00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:56,190
it and how come that you know I'm the

00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:58,290
maintainer of the mothership but I'm

00:08:56,190 --> 00:09:00,630
also maintaining classy and John Orban

00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:03,450
who is the maintainer of sin which F all

00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:05,310
the classes in he's maintainer of stock

00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:07,529
which is basically cause Naga Bob I

00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:09,149
don't know why that happened but it kind

00:09:07,529 --> 00:09:12,990
of happened and you know submitted patch

00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:14,459
if you don't like it this is actually

00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:16,160
the amount of maintenance we have now

00:09:14,459 --> 00:09:18,540
this is a big change from Drupal 7 where

00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:20,580
this is actually people who are active

00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:22,950
in the theme community and actually do

00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:24,950
stuff and it's actually fun dinners and

00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:27,120
it's nice to have them on board here

00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:28,890
we're going to do rounds of hands and

00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,600
clapping off them later on so it's going

00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:32,310
to set up how do we do this stuff so

00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:35,459
first of all your drupal themes is kind

00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:38,190
of live inside of / themes in your call

00:09:35,459 --> 00:09:39,920
root which i know is kind of crazy why

00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:42,120
don't we hide it down inside / or /

00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,920
something so nobody can find it we can

00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:46,380
find the new but the office and left of

00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:49,200
him we don't just put it inside of /

00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:50,640
themes can I have four different files

00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,770
you can work with you have your info

00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,420
file and info files or at the same way

00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:56,160
as they used to do you have your basic

00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:59,339
info you have your libraries you have

00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:01,649
the ability to remove CSS and you have

00:09:59,339 --> 00:10:03,480
different regions remove CSS is pretty

00:10:01,649 --> 00:10:04,589
sweet as you so you have a CSS file you

00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:06,660
don't want to see in your theme that

00:10:04,589 --> 00:10:08,339
came from somewhere you know evil module

00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:10,800
developer pushed it in you can actually

00:10:08,339 --> 00:10:13,410
remove it all again and it's visible to

00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:15,300
do that so I set these ivories okay what

00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:17,430
is a library the idea behind the library

00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:19,920
is that we defined libraries is a

00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:21,930
collections of CSS and JavaScript files

00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:24,450
and then you can call them from either

00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:25,950
your theme or your module or actually a

00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:28,589
template file and we're going to come

00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:29,970
into why that's so sweet so if you

00:10:28,589 --> 00:10:31,680
decide ok I'm going to do a slider

00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:33,149
because we need to slide the right on

00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,010
our side that's every side needs the

00:10:33,149 --> 00:10:36,839
needs one slider well you're going to

00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:39,510
add in your JavaScript into CSS file for

00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:41,209
that and then defined it here's a very

00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:44,059
very simple

00:10:41,209 --> 00:10:46,009
of it it's a small little library by

00:10:44,059 --> 00:10:48,139
what beta does you defining i name you

00:10:46,009 --> 00:10:50,179
defined your CSS files you define your

00:10:48,139 --> 00:10:52,550
javascript stuff as well and then if

00:10:50,179 --> 00:10:54,319
there's any dependencies this dependency

00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:56,179
by the way down there jquery if you

00:10:54,319 --> 00:10:57,649
don't put that into your library we're

00:10:56,179 --> 00:11:03,470
not going to include jaqua and your

00:10:57,649 --> 00:11:06,170
theme that was 32 kilo that was just

00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:09,980
goodbye and again this is you have to

00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:12,249
turn stuff on in Drupal 8 not try to use

00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:14,829
a week of your life to remove stuff and

00:11:12,249 --> 00:11:17,509
CSS is getting reorganized as well and

00:11:14,829 --> 00:11:19,850
we're using this smacks terminology base

00:11:17,509 --> 00:11:21,589
layout troponin states and theme if you

00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:23,240
don't know about smacks go read about

00:11:21,589 --> 00:11:25,160
it's a lot of the things we're doing in

00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:29,360
Drupal now it's built on this

00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:32,089
terminology smacks smh CCS dot CSS are

00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,170
thought there is as I have links at the

00:11:32,089 --> 00:11:35,480
end when I cannot figure out how to

00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:37,160
spell we also have breakpoints built in

00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:39,980
a breakpoint what do they do well

00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:41,420
basically these are your your theme you

00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:43,790
define your image size you have that as

00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:45,920
well if you really want to put in you

00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:49,910
know dumb stuff you can still put that's

00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:51,619
dumb stuff in by PHP and you do that in

00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:52,999
your dumb theme folder we're not going

00:11:51,619 --> 00:11:55,040
to talk about that first of all we're

00:11:52,999 --> 00:11:56,480
going to look into some of the tools and

00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,490
I'm going to rush through some of some

00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,899
of this stuff so we can get through all

00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:01,309
of it before you die loomis you have

00:11:59,899 --> 00:12:05,720
much time to enough lift I don't even

00:12:01,309 --> 00:12:07,939
know anyways so your settings file this

00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:09,829
slide and this slide is only here just

00:12:07,939 --> 00:12:12,199
so you can i find the math errors and

00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:13,699
check it out so also by the way remember

00:12:12,199 --> 00:12:16,369
to disable cast the first time you

00:12:13,699 --> 00:12:17,720
install the side first thing we're going

00:12:16,369 --> 00:12:20,720
to do here is we're going to look into

00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:22,339
our services file and the service file i

00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,470
want to do is we have a theme deepak

00:12:22,339 --> 00:12:26,179
element inside of tricking out building

00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:28,480
and this is pretty much the sweetest

00:12:26,179 --> 00:12:31,879
 you're going to see all week so

00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:33,410
what we do here is I go in I'm trying to

00:12:31,879 --> 00:12:35,929
figure out what kind of templates have a

00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:37,819
user and I can of course guess my way

00:12:35,929 --> 00:12:39,589
through all the templates because that's

00:12:37,819 --> 00:12:41,389
how it is in two gu7 like though it's

00:12:39,589 --> 00:12:43,549
called a note it's probably the note

00:12:41,389 --> 00:12:46,100
template since that so what I do now is

00:12:43,549 --> 00:12:48,529
I have likely at my cash I'm gonna

00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:50,360
reload it and boom what is this you have

00:12:48,529 --> 00:12:53,470
comment you have polluted my mark up

00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:55,210
with comments of sanity

00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:58,210
and let's look into that while we got

00:12:55,210 --> 00:13:01,420
here Pam that looks sexy right let's

00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:02,890
look at this this is every template file

00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:04,450
i get a call through drupal this is

00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:05,890
going to be in your source code so you

00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:07,960
can actually now see where it gets that

00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:10,600
you can I have an idea of this is my

00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:12,790
suggestion files I could use for even

00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:14,920
better when you go look for it we

00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:17,170
provided the path to it so you can find

00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:18,880
your stuff I know this has created job

00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:20,800
security for us for years where you

00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,940
couldn't find anything but which trying

00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,010
to actually make it a pleasant

00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:28,710
experience to be the theme instead of

00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:32,620
like an IT like day-to-day nightmare um

00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:34,810
see here what got here so the next thing

00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:37,810
is still now I found on file how do I

00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:39,940
find my data well here comes Kent Kent

00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:42,610
is kind of the new version of Chrome oh

00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:45,700
and what does it do well you do Kent

00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:48,640
that content it constantly Josh it was

00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:51,490
not not found and I caught the video and

00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:53,830
i reloaded it okay here we go so what I

00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:55,210
do can't I like given variable what I

00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:57,700
get here is like then all of the

00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:58,870
elements that it puts out the problem

00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:59,770
with this and that thing we actually

00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:01,720
really want to work on in the future

00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:03,190
this is very good for developers it's

00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:04,990
really shitty for Themis because you can

00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:07,090
see there's a ton of data that we

00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:09,100
don't use for anything but no someone's

00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:10,420
going to fix that on Friday but Kent is

00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:14,010
the way you're going to get you yet they

00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:16,150
are like on friday Carson who fixes

00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:20,560
cartridge fixing it right now I can see

00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:22,000
he's not he's nodding no it is not um so

00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:24,000
28 Deepak this is how you're gonna get

00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,980
there in and this is kind of like just

00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,990
how all I've got to make way way easier

00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:31,780
so we we have the template structure

00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:33,970
when you have 125 templates built into a

00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:36,880
system you know it's can I have kind of

00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:39,070
Oaks get a little bit fast you know when

00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:40,360
we nuke this system we removed all the

00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:41,920
theme functions theme songs just

00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:43,660
practice don't exist anymore we have

00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,520
added in a metric ton up of

00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:48,880
templates and there is a ton of

00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:51,250
templates it's about 125 of them so if

00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:53,620
you go in and you take a look into em

00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:57,760
into Tupac or I figure out your what

00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:59,230
goes on here you can see here is we have

00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:02,050
all of the template and they are built

00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:04,270
into different folders so you can

00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:06,130
actually find stuff again so we have so

00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:06,710
at least try to organize them in some

00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:10,160
kind of

00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:11,540
you know sensible matter these are like

00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,730
the basic groups we're trying to

00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:15,680
organize them in nobody says you have to

00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:18,340
use this organization but this was a

00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:21,320
thing we came up with doing a month of

00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:22,880
heat and yelling in the issue queue to

00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:24,830
how to do that so it's a way of

00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:26,480
organizing it the templates are still

00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:28,790
doing the same as they used to do back

00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:31,610
in back in Drupal 7 so you have HTML

00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:33,530
page you have your page and after the

00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:35,000
page you know you have you have regions

00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:37,970
that comes in you can put stuff in and

00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:40,370
inside the region and you're going to

00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:43,010
get all of your different content and

00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:44,690
then you have to note and inside of the

00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:46,670
node that's where you know all of the

00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:48,080
fields are turning up where fields all

00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:49,490
over the note and that's actually what

00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:51,350
I'm really really looking forward to

00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:53,360
talk about before we go into that

00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:55,670
because this is eight years of work

00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:57,560
before we go into that the thing we can

00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:59,810
do now because everything is built in

00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:02,150
your template how do you lay out how do

00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:04,310
you separate your stuff how we do that

00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:07,610
is we use this wonderful function called

00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:09,740
without and what without do is you can

00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:12,100
print out all of your content then you

00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:14,270
can print it out without certain fields

00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:16,430
so basically looks like this you do

00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:18,020
content pipe then you know the trig

00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:19,280
function without and then the field

00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:20,810
names you want to remove and it will

00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:22,580
looks like something like this in your

00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:24,670
template just to get this idea into your

00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:27,320
head how is it actually doing this is

00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:29,960
here we do here we have a trait template

00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:31,160
and this is the layout we want to end up

00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:32,630
with we have a content we have two

00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:34,430
fields next to it and they're going to

00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:36,050
be separated by Marg ups and a couple of

00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:38,210
div and a section technological and so

00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:40,970
forth and and this is what happens when

00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:42,500
I just print content out right now it's

00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:43,550
printing all of the variables out I have

00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,960
their all of the fields and I want to

00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:46,700
separate them out so I do content

00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:51,500
without and then the name of that fields

00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:52,730
and so when I print out content it's

00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,990
going to print out all the other fields

00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:56,060
that are there and then I can be in two

00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:57,890
separate them out one by one why is that

00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:59,690
really sneaky well we all know what

00:16:57,890 --> 00:17:01,280
happens when we built a project so we

00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:03,050
start by separating stuff out and then

00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:04,490
six months later somebody got the good

00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:06,230
idea of adding that field that the

00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:08,990
client actually asked for they pushed it

00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:10,790
into the code and you never printed out

00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:12,800
content because you did needed that you

00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:14,690
have separated for the art yourself and

00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:16,250
then what happens is nobody can figure

00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:17,449
out when it comes everybody yells and

00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:18,870
it's going to be your fault because

00:17:17,449 --> 00:17:22,170
you're the femur and

00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:23,730
of them are ignorant developers and so

00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:25,410
now when we're doing this content

00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:27,059
without when it comes a new feeling it's

00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:29,160
just going to be printed but you

00:17:27,059 --> 00:17:31,680
separate them out one by one by one and

00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:34,080
you then print them out by content dot

00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:35,430
and then the field name in that way you

00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,630
can print each element now you can

00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:39,030
separate them as you want to get

00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:42,570
complete control over like that blog of

00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:45,090
content so a really an example of that

00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:47,550
we hear you have my left part my my on

00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:50,130
my part I have my field field image and

00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:52,140
on the top I have my field tags and

00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:55,170
that's your layer I said how you can

00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:57,390
control on each each node or each field

00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:58,830
or if you want to remove a part of an

00:17:57,390 --> 00:18:01,230
attribute that's all you can do the same

00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:03,210
thing so this is a way you cherry-pick

00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:06,690
what you don't want to see and you can

00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:08,610
clean that out and but here here's the

00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:12,030
here's the essence of my home talk and

00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:14,370
this has been I'm not known to try over

00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:16,440
markup but this almost makes me a little

00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:19,620
bit teary and it has been eight years of

00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:21,840
me hating on divis and drupal and you

00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:24,059
know we can ask one question how many

00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:26,670
dips does it take to make a single feel

00:18:24,059 --> 00:18:29,990
with one value how many dips should be

00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:34,890
used for that anybody clever in the room

00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:36,510
none how about one then maybe maybe okay

00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:38,940
let's see what we can do here so here's

00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:44,210
the fields right it has a label and a

00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:48,300
type and it says yo this is drew gu7

00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:49,590
this is what Drupal 7 prints out it has

00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:52,140
a couple of descriptions they have the

00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:54,630
fields they have filled items and field

00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:56,720
item and they can make sense if you want

00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:59,370
to build all your markup in one way and

00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:00,600
so this is what class it puts out so

00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:02,940
like what the ball didn't you

00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:05,820
didn't you say you had removed all the

00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:07,920
markup for no no this is classy and we

00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:09,360
want to have basic markup and classy so

00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:10,710
if you don't want to if you don't know

00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,630
anything about how to do all this stuff

00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:14,400
you just might have some classes you put

00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:17,550
 in this is what you're going to get

00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:19,950
out what you can do is you can do this

00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:21,510
instead well you don't actually don't

00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:24,780
even have to put the thieves in there

00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:26,760
because we have moved them all out so

00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:28,080
basically out of group will call if you

00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:30,570
don't do anything we just have a diff

00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:31,940
around them just for funsies so it's one

00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:34,580
div 0 classes one

00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:36,710
% Drupal if which said that a year ago

00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:38,750
were actually three weeks ago that was

00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:40,700
not possible that patch finally came in

00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:42,409
I have traveled the world and sold in

00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:44,779
more conferences that is good for me and

00:19:42,409 --> 00:19:47,000
had more discussion you actually started

00:19:44,779 --> 00:19:48,230
that in Stockholm two years ago when we

00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,759
tried to figure out how to solve this

00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:52,970
issue and there's a reason for it

00:19:49,759 --> 00:19:54,679
because it's actually hard to figure out

00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:56,240
how to do this and you know it's great

00:19:54,679 --> 00:19:57,649
that we just provided you with a single

00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:00,169
dip but what the am I going to do

00:19:57,649 --> 00:20:02,240
with that there's nothing in it so how

00:20:00,169 --> 00:20:03,950
do we work with that one first of all

00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:06,559
the idea is whatever you want to have it

00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:08,059
to do that's the whole fault it's your

00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:09,710
theme you decide what you want to do

00:20:08,059 --> 00:20:11,539
with it unless you go with classy or

00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:14,419
another pre based theme then you can go

00:20:11,539 --> 00:20:16,639
that way so this illustrates i'm using

00:20:14,419 --> 00:20:18,139
it fields and a value like that's how

00:20:16,639 --> 00:20:20,149
they all defined and we're going to have

00:20:18,139 --> 00:20:22,940
actually four different variations of

00:20:20,149 --> 00:20:25,220
what a field can do single label single

00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:26,870
and a label and multiple and multiples

00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:28,549
with a label that's the four different

00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:31,610
versions you can have and we have one

00:20:28,549 --> 00:20:33,139
template to fix this um so that means

00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:36,289
that you're going to have these four

00:20:33,139 --> 00:20:38,090
variations of fields this is every field

00:20:36,289 --> 00:20:39,350
that comes out actually has these four

00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:41,210
variations that makes the template a

00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:43,039
little bit complicated this is just so

00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:44,299
we don't hear people whine in about

00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:46,009
three weeks when you all begin to

00:20:44,299 --> 00:20:47,570
youtube later like but more than it's

00:20:46,009 --> 00:20:50,779
complicated yes we know it's complicated

00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:53,690
because it's complicated we're grown-ass

00:20:50,779 --> 00:20:54,860
steamers so we know how to fix this the

00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:56,600
other thing is that we have to manage

00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:58,759
display which is figuring out kind of a

00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:00,919
UI how to do the labor so we also have

00:20:58,759 --> 00:21:04,519
to take that to take care of that which

00:21:00,919 --> 00:21:07,309
means in now we now we have been fast

00:21:04,519 --> 00:21:09,019
come here yes we have in line we have a

00:21:07,309 --> 00:21:10,429
bath and we have a visual hidden

00:21:09,019 --> 00:21:11,899
elements as well these are all the

00:21:10,429 --> 00:21:14,000
different things we need to take care of

00:21:11,899 --> 00:21:17,029
in one template without shooting

00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:19,190
ourselves too much in the foot so this

00:21:17,029 --> 00:21:20,629
is how the field template looked this is

00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:22,250
how we control everything on and to make

00:21:20,629 --> 00:21:24,529
it a little bit easier to get if we

00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:26,120
start by saying okay it's the label no

00:21:24,529 --> 00:21:28,850
that's not fine we're going to print

00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:30,470
these out doing simple else loops and

00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:32,090
we're going to go all the way down and

00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:33,289
you can actually do the else and that's

00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:36,080
where you get the single value with

00:21:33,289 --> 00:21:38,629
nothing in and to make it a little bit

00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:41,330
like pseudo cody and i would say if the

00:21:38,629 --> 00:21:43,610
label if flip is hidden if there's

00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:45,410
multiples not print out multiples if not

00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:47,480
print out the single

00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:49,160
moment else okay there's multiple

00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:51,080
elements of them we need the label we

00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:52,790
need to print this data out and if

00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:54,200
there's just a label and the item that's

00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:55,340
we're going to going to print out so now

00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,990
we know what kind of data are we going

00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:59,330
to have fair enough so we can actually

00:21:56,990 --> 00:22:00,950
do this pretty easy we don't even have

00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:02,870
to put the diffs around you can just let

00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:04,730
them flow this we want but this is like

00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:06,770
I'll cost the markup and we can go that

00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:08,060
way fair enough how do then add the

00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:09,650
classes to it well this is where

00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:12,740
attributes come in and attributes is

00:22:09,650 --> 00:22:14,660
some sexy ass because that's where

00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:16,880
we can put all kinds of crazy data stuff

00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:19,880
in describing our elements and work with

00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:23,030
that um so attributes can be a class can

00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:24,410
be data your area text so forth all of

00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:27,770
these different things the stuff we want

00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:30,200
to put into a markup and in Google 7 we

00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:32,390
did this here you go here's all your

00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:34,640
stuff have fun do a regular expression

00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:36,290
and your stuff and try to figure it out

00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:38,150
what we want to do in Drupal same all

00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:41,330
you could try to do it when preprocessor

00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:42,620
GPL file or theme function that over to

00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:44,570
go over and other thing folks which was

00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:46,940
really really brilliant because then you

00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:48,470
have multiple parts of code there so in

00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:50,540
jubilate what we're doing instead is

00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:52,190
like all the barrels through classy and

00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:53,690
push it that way and then we're going to

00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:55,790
provide the classes so we are going to

00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:58,010
provide all the classes inside of a

00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:59,930
template like wait a minute are we going

00:22:58,010 --> 00:23:01,370
to put all the templates all the classes

00:22:59,930 --> 00:23:03,170
inside the template the theme was

00:23:01,370 --> 00:23:05,060
already sitting in he doesn't have to

00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:07,370
find a preprocess function and look for

00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:09,290
that and hope for the best yes that is

00:23:07,370 --> 00:23:12,020
exactly what we have done we have used

00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:15,170
an huge amount of logic and how fun did

00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:16,640
this actually work and so what you can

00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:18,650
do is here is you can add a class to

00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:21,380
anything and what I'm doing this little

00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:22,580
example is I do asset class up here so

00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:24,140
you can create a little variable into a

00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:26,120
field and then i an't you know at the

00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:27,890
field Damon do a clean glass to make

00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:29,750
sure that if the field name has some

00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:32,480
kind of dumb data in it we can i still

00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:33,830
use it on CSS and then down in mind if i

00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,870
want to put stuff into a do my

00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:38,690
attributes another 2d thought at class

00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:42,050
and then i can push the closets in and

00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:43,970
wha-la tax comes from another place and

00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:45,740
here's my fuel tax so you can then begin

00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:47,660
to like modify and play around with your

00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:49,550
checks as you want to if you have an

00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:51,050
evil module that puts crapped out that

00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:52,400
you don't want to have or it came from

00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:54,230
somewhere you have no idea you could do

00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:56,270
the same thing you can do a remove class

00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:57,950
as well we even have a hash class so you

00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:59,220
can test different element has a class

00:23:57,950 --> 00:24:00,720
then you can change the

00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:02,429
name on it so in that way we're not

00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:04,200
we're separating ourselves for whatever

00:24:02,429 --> 00:24:05,909
we figure out right now we want to call

00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:08,730
store for Drupal and you can control

00:24:05,909 --> 00:24:10,919
your own theme completely as you want so

00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:13,380
to sum that up you have core can provide

00:24:10,919 --> 00:24:14,880
classes then it will provide some

00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:16,470
classes like this visible we have very

00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,909
few things that's going to be provided

00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:20,190
by car and we're going to have

00:24:17,909 --> 00:24:22,590
attributes and module can push stuff in

00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:25,080
and these attributes we from the theme

00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:27,120
layer can then go in and work with so if

00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:28,440
I want to remove the modules well i'm

00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:30,890
just going to do every move module and

00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:32,909
it's going to remove that and so forth

00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:34,740
another thing we done with the class is

00:24:32,909 --> 00:24:37,049
now down here is we have separated out

00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:39,840
all the JavaScript classes that

00:24:37,049 --> 00:24:41,730
JavaScript use uses and so they will be

00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:44,580
named with the jas that or something it

00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:46,650
is also to warn you as a CSS junkie not

00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:48,600
to with this class pretty please if

00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:50,669
you remove this class stuff will break

00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:52,080
these classes are not used so you're

00:24:50,669 --> 00:24:54,600
going to see a lot of double classes you

00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:55,980
have a full class at ajs best food the

00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:58,380
food class is the one we're going to use

00:24:55,980 --> 00:25:00,390
for the styling or depreciate the jas

00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:02,880
class is the one that javascript users

00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:04,710
just so you know and so we have done a

00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:07,320
separation of that so to sum it up you

00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:08,850
know to add in classes you can if

00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:10,350
attribute you can remove them you can

00:25:08,850 --> 00:25:13,169
add them you can set an attribute you

00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:15,289
put in an ID if you want to do that and

00:25:13,169 --> 00:25:18,720
print all that stuff out as you want to

00:25:15,289 --> 00:25:21,990
and that's like that's how we took the

00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:24,390
control of how CSS classes got generated

00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:26,220
and moved them away for being a hidden

00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:28,409
down in the template and priam Priebus

00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:30,929
function and actually put it out to the

00:25:28,409 --> 00:25:33,510
code and if you're a developer and you

00:25:30,929 --> 00:25:35,250
ever ever put a class directly

00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:38,130
into your module you're idiot

00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:39,360
and you're pissing on us let me just let

00:25:38,130 --> 00:25:42,990
me just say that with a little bit of

00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:44,970
feeling because because here's the thing

00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:46,440
what we want to do from the front end we

00:25:44,970 --> 00:25:48,150
want to support our developers we want

00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:50,190
to make the most beautiful themes we can

00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:52,409
do we cannot do that if you hide this

00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:54,059
stuff from us so if you give us that we

00:25:52,409 --> 00:25:56,159
will help you out we will take care of

00:25:54,059 --> 00:25:57,780
the designers for you it's not a kind of

00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:59,610
ok deal we take care of the designers

00:25:57,780 --> 00:26:01,380
you take care of the data we can all

00:25:59,610 --> 00:26:04,860
like Dan's out in the sunset have party

00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:07,049
all night so that's the attributes ok so

00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:08,429
let's make field and attributes figure

00:26:07,049 --> 00:26:12,080
out what kind of safety stuff they can

00:26:08,429 --> 00:26:12,080
make when they are casing in a tree

00:26:13,459 --> 00:26:18,029
so go back to the example before this is

00:26:16,169 --> 00:26:19,589
like my just three different versions we

00:26:18,029 --> 00:26:21,509
have yo we have labeled yo we have

00:26:19,589 --> 00:26:23,669
labeled yo a high which is the dainius

00:26:21,509 --> 00:26:26,809
what you're saying yo hi if you're sweet

00:26:23,669 --> 00:26:30,029
as you say something else I don't know

00:26:26,809 --> 00:26:31,679
so Google call it kind of put our class

00:26:30,029 --> 00:26:33,299
he puts out like these few label and

00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:36,059
stuff so just so you know why they're

00:26:33,299 --> 00:26:37,889
there the reason they're there is just

00:26:36,059 --> 00:26:40,529
to describe each element as a basic

00:26:37,889 --> 00:26:42,239
element good thing about that is like

00:26:40,529 --> 00:26:43,379
you have fields have a field underscore

00:26:42,239 --> 00:26:45,029
underscore label and your field on the

00:26:43,379 --> 00:26:47,129
school nurse called item that's how all

00:26:45,029 --> 00:26:48,329
your stuff would be predefined no

00:26:47,129 --> 00:26:49,739
worries we're going to remove all of

00:26:48,329 --> 00:26:51,869
them and put it in our own stuff because

00:26:49,739 --> 00:26:53,129
that's way cooler but just to a kid idea

00:26:51,869 --> 00:26:55,019
why we have done and how we've done it

00:26:53,129 --> 00:26:56,789
if you have multiple items and you have

00:26:55,019 --> 00:26:58,259
a label you also have a wrapper around

00:26:56,789 --> 00:27:00,359
the field item so you can be in two

00:26:58,259 --> 00:27:02,789
separate them in your markup so if you

00:27:00,359 --> 00:27:04,200
are not a fun dinner who do not want to

00:27:02,789 --> 00:27:06,059
do all these things you actually have a

00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:09,570
basic element and basically we have

00:27:06,059 --> 00:27:11,879
described all fields but let's start

00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:13,739
with taking our field and fixing the

00:27:11,879 --> 00:27:17,820
mark-up that's going to be the first

00:27:13,739 --> 00:27:21,419
thing so see here if I'm going to start

00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:23,820
so here's my fields it's just a bunch of

00:27:21,419 --> 00:27:25,139
basic elements I found my template up

00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:28,049
here and you can see it puts out all

00:27:25,139 --> 00:27:29,849
this crap and we need this should be an

00:27:28,049 --> 00:27:32,549
on over the list right that would make

00:27:29,849 --> 00:27:33,719
sense um let's start by doing that so

00:27:32,549 --> 00:27:35,159
I'm going to go in and just like

00:27:33,719 --> 00:27:37,950
override my stuff as you can see we have

00:27:35,159 --> 00:27:40,079
the the mark office please clearly put

00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:41,609
there you have like an item that

00:27:40,079 --> 00:27:43,259
attributes at class we have two

00:27:41,609 --> 00:27:44,789
different classes up there as well so I

00:27:43,259 --> 00:27:47,820
just reload it again to sharia i'm not

00:27:44,789 --> 00:27:50,820
completely full of i should be able

00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:54,709
to change it out that were fair enough i

00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:57,959
change the dhol i owe her a superhero

00:27:54,709 --> 00:27:59,729
but if we take like one step further and

00:27:57,959 --> 00:28:01,289
this is actually where I kind of kind of

00:27:59,729 --> 00:28:03,259
card in my video so what I'm doing right

00:28:01,289 --> 00:28:06,019
now so removing all the classes and

00:28:03,259 --> 00:28:08,549
which you cannot see because I'm

00:28:06,019 --> 00:28:09,719
sometimes Dominic goes a little bit fast

00:28:08,549 --> 00:28:12,479
when you have to like record these

00:28:09,719 --> 00:28:15,629
things yes as you can see up there at

00:28:12,479 --> 00:28:17,369
class where I remove the stuff there's

00:28:15,629 --> 00:28:21,400
nothing in it so what's going to happen

00:28:17,369 --> 00:28:25,750
now tan-tan tan tan-tan tan tan-tan

00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:28,510
and done BAM Jubal template1 field I

00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:33,280
want to fix and it's done nothing else

00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:35,050
nothing more easy pc okay fair

00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:36,280
enough let's put some colors and stuff

00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:37,870
on it let's figure out what we can do

00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:39,490
this so let's try to take these

00:28:37,870 --> 00:28:41,890
libraries remember I talked about them

00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:43,240
at the start I guess libraries and how

00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:45,880
do you have to use them all let's let's

00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:48,580
add them directly to a template so we're

00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:58,180
going to do that so you add a library

00:28:48,580 --> 00:29:01,300
see here we want to start yes okay so

00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:03,610
who go in so here's my library's file

00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:05,410
and I'm defined a very a field magic as

00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:08,290
i've called it i've added adding in a

00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:12,100
CSS file called barthelona so quite

00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:13,690
pronounced butter and donna so inside of

00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:17,740
here you can see I have some very magic

00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:19,990
magic magic CSS and I'm in my field des

00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:22,090
des note dance tears filled HTML file

00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:24,160
I'm going to do attach underscore not

00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:26,710
room and then Barcelona and then call to

00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:28,660
that name of that library so what's

00:29:26,710 --> 00:29:30,640
going to happen now is go in and look

00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:32,740
into my markup just going to search for

00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:35,200
Barcelona let's see it says boom now you

00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:37,470
have a template that is calling a CSS

00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:40,270
file only when it needs that CSS file I

00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:42,010
think do that is pretty sweet let's

00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:43,660
let's add some classes and just a fair

00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:45,850
warning I do know this example I'm going

00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:49,420
to show you can do that with just with

00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:51,370
CSS I'm fully aware of how css3 works I

00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:53,230
work with different databases but I had

00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:54,760
to find some kind of example but color

00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:58,000
sense or you wouldn't like fall

00:29:54,760 --> 00:30:00,460
completely asleep so here's my CSS file

00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:03,100
and as you can see it has the first and

00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:04,920
I last element there's a border on top

00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:07,360
bolt on the bottom collar blue collar

00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:13,080
wet and color yellow these are my colors

00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:17,260
i'm going to use for this example and

00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:19,990
let's see here so these and this is

00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:21,700
again just like basic demo stuff to show

00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:22,960
you other stuff so what i'm doing here

00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:25,360
is i'm doing set course of setting

00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:27,700
available that says color dash and then

00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:30,370
I'm doing cycle red and yellow and that

00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:32,200
you want do index so I'm kind of cycles

00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:34,570
through the X amount of elements that's

00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:36,100
there so i knew i was in barcelona

00:30:34,570 --> 00:30:37,450
thorner should keep it to these colors

00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:39,490
and crawls or go with black arrange that

00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:42,029
man and then you know you push in your

00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:44,440
classes as you want them that's all good

00:30:42,029 --> 00:30:46,659
did I put in a little bit more like go

00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:48,100
and sit on this so the loop dot index is

00:30:46,659 --> 00:30:50,259
a thing you can actually test stuff on

00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:52,389
but you also have loopt of first loop

00:30:50,259 --> 00:30:53,860
dot last what they do is like the first

00:30:52,389 --> 00:30:56,590
part of the loop the last part of the

00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:58,570
loop you can say from that as well so we

00:30:56,590 --> 00:30:59,950
throw in your last class in the first

00:30:58,570 --> 00:31:02,190
class and you can see you've got a

00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:05,350
little bit of pretty pretty pink on it

00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:06,879
another thing you can do is which is

00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:09,039
kind of fun you can go in and you can do

00:31:06,879 --> 00:31:11,169
a count and stuff so you say well okay

00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:12,730
if you're the third element by the way

00:31:11,169 --> 00:31:14,830
trick starts by counting from one

00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:18,909
because it's built for humans and not

00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:20,980
nerds you can you can set it to council

00:31:18,909 --> 00:31:22,509
Shiro if you have no idea how normal

00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:25,210
numbers works for normal people so

00:31:22,509 --> 00:31:27,610
though it is it is proven for for epic

00:31:25,210 --> 00:31:31,299
geeks but I feel very nice to say yep

00:31:27,610 --> 00:31:34,570
first element um which is kind of nice

00:31:31,299 --> 00:31:36,490
okay so am so now we could do that well

00:31:34,570 --> 00:31:38,320
okay how about we just change stuff

00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:40,149
complete when I hit number eight on my

00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:41,169
fields we're going to do another thing

00:31:40,149 --> 00:31:44,889
we're going to play around with a little

00:31:41,169 --> 00:31:46,779
bit so I put in my huge blue hitter up

00:31:44,889 --> 00:31:48,159
there and number three and still just

00:31:46,779 --> 00:31:50,289
printing out the Naga well what if I

00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:52,419
don't want to print out the values on

00:31:50,289 --> 00:31:55,539
the specific element how can we do that

00:31:52,419 --> 00:31:57,539
well we will jump in again no it's asked

00:31:55,539 --> 00:32:00,100
me here when its Trubel it coming out so

00:31:57,539 --> 00:32:01,659
we know that is the eight element of our

00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:04,360
list so I'm going to do I'll do an

00:32:01,659 --> 00:32:07,750
account of like if dupe index I want to

00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:12,129
connect you said it's oh sorry damn

00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:13,179
it i thought i could stop it so and when

00:32:12,129 --> 00:32:15,070
you look at when you're doing these

00:32:13,179 --> 00:32:17,230
loops I'm doing I'm doing a count on

00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:18,820
Duke index loop that NZ where we count

00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:21,039
stuff so it said I dupe to the index one

00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:22,419
or here aight do something else do

00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:24,370
something else so I'm basically just

00:32:22,419 --> 00:32:26,129
wrapping out my data i'm printing out

00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:28,539
i'm wrapping that out and then i'm

00:32:26,129 --> 00:32:30,669
printing the basic lemon out with the

00:32:28,539 --> 00:32:32,889
add classes colors in if i want to have

00:32:30,669 --> 00:32:36,039
them and then here you know we're going

00:32:32,889 --> 00:32:38,639
to do some dumb stuff with it I think I

00:32:36,039 --> 00:32:41,679
think I printed something out like just

00:32:38,639 --> 00:32:44,919
normally we would print out the data but

00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:47,190
let's not do that there's just remove

00:32:44,919 --> 00:32:47,190
stuff

00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:53,240
and then do and when it's ready because

00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:54,710
we know when two waves come out it's

00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:56,780
apparently when it's really not one it

00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:58,460
would be fun to have a beach party today

00:32:56,780 --> 00:33:00,350
right and celebrate too polite because

00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:01,700
some kind of politics and when you

00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:04,700
release stuff that would be like

00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:08,000
completely stupid that was not me being

00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:09,950
sarcastic at all by the way so what I've

00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,680
done here is ill I took the eighth

00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:14,030
element of an element that I ripped

00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:16,160
everything out of it and changed it

00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:19,190
exactly as I wanted and I added in my

00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:21,440
CSS file to that specific field so if

00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:23,540
this field is ever called it's kind of

00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:25,100
cold the Barcelona file and that to me

00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:28,040
is kind of giving it it'll pretty much

00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:30,620
then complete control over it and this

00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:32,510
attached library thing if you if you

00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:35,030
ever looked into design components of

00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:37,310
people web design components quick hand

00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:38,780
up who knows about design kabooms okay

00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:40,760
the idea behind the design component is

00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:42,740
we take pretty much a piece of markup

00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:44,870
piece of CSS and a piece of JavaScript

00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:46,460
and we stack that crap together in its

00:33:44,870 --> 00:33:50,060
own folder that's kind of the quick way

00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:52,010
of expletives that kinda kind of telling

00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:54,230
it probably going to be beat by that but

00:33:52,010 --> 00:33:55,670
it that way we can actually begin to do

00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:57,020
these things in Drupal 8 we have talked

00:33:55,670 --> 00:33:59,210
about it if you want to try to push it

00:33:57,020 --> 00:34:03,080
in I know that Lewis sitting over there

00:33:59,210 --> 00:34:04,610
and is falling asleep geez am I heard

00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:06,350
there's so many times no we've been a

00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:08,000
big advocate thought we've been talking

00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:10,520
about it we're not going to try to push

00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,810
it in in 8.0 because we kind of just

00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:14,420
want to get this out so we're going

00:34:11,810 --> 00:34:16,520
to play with these things so apparently

00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:18,920
it was not enough for you guys to go

00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:21,170
apeshit that we just got complete

00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:22,660
control over our fields so let's see if

00:34:21,170 --> 00:34:24,890
I can entertain you a little bit more

00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:26,120
trick blocks what is a trach block

00:34:24,890 --> 00:34:29,150
that's a whole other thing we can do

00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:31,970
here so here we have a page and you know

00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:33,230
that page we can split up and normally

00:34:31,970 --> 00:34:35,180
you would have multiple versions of a

00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:37,070
page template and do rule seven if you

00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:38,330
wanted to do something with it and but

00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:40,940
what we're going to do here instead is

00:34:38,330 --> 00:34:42,770
we are going to put in a block and

00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:46,040
inside of that blog we're thinking like

00:34:42,770 --> 00:34:48,080
calling other templates when certain

00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:50,510
things appears the idea here is if I'm

00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:52,730
on the front page I wanna and I kind of

00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:54,800
inject a piece of markup from another

00:34:52,730 --> 00:34:56,390
template and I smack that into my

00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:58,100
template so I don't need to have

00:34:56,390 --> 00:34:59,960
multiple versions of my page template

00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:03,109
did that make sense

00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:05,300
not at all okay I've made a demo and

00:35:03,109 --> 00:35:10,960
this is using pretty color so you can

00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:10,960
get it and so I'm here defining a block

00:35:13,869 --> 00:35:18,320
we call this by the way another block we

00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:20,359
call it a Twix plot because LS Drupal

00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:21,589
wall gets really really complicated so

00:35:20,359 --> 00:35:24,380
this trade bloc is called more than

00:35:21,589 --> 00:35:26,990
decays awesome which is truth and we're

00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:28,580
going to add some some stuff enjoy first

00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:30,859
cold treatment now let's give it a color

00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:34,490
green and the idea here is to say well

00:35:30,859 --> 00:35:37,369
if this part can be exchanged when

00:35:34,490 --> 00:35:39,800
certain things happens so if my page

00:35:37,369 --> 00:35:42,230
template things that should load the

00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:44,060
front page it's just gonna push in a

00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:48,230
little piece here so you have an element

00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:50,690
that I can exchange am and if I load my

00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:54,140
page so it goes like I'm a trick login

00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:55,520
screen now and we go in with chicken

00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:57,650
okay what kind of elements do we have to

00:35:55,520 --> 00:36:02,920
work with here okay I have a paste a

00:35:57,650 --> 00:36:02,920
stash front and let me just copy that

00:36:04,089 --> 00:36:12,440
after note the funds thank you make a

00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:14,390
new file earth so this kind of its using

00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:17,510
the extent command which you probably

00:36:14,390 --> 00:36:19,520
want to read about or hear about and the

00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:20,990
idea is again you have a page you can

00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:22,790
inject stuff it's only not only the page

00:36:20,990 --> 00:36:26,900
you can do this on any element you can

00:36:22,790 --> 00:36:28,609
find in the world of google so here take

00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:33,710
it I'll take it change it to green and

00:36:28,609 --> 00:36:38,450
I'm going to make sure that it knows

00:36:33,710 --> 00:36:39,980
what to extent and this is where the

00:36:38,450 --> 00:36:41,690
video editing by the way it's really

00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:43,369
really awesome because that's when you

00:36:41,690 --> 00:36:47,349
figure I wrote something wrong it is

00:36:43,369 --> 00:36:47,349
that actually exploded the first time

00:36:48,970 --> 00:36:54,830
and let's see here diluted a copy about

00:36:53,630 --> 00:37:00,080
do we still have to put the whole path

00:36:54,830 --> 00:37:01,940
in hudson and we we can like we can use

00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:04,880
the shortcuts right yeah so you can use

00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:10,580
like an ad classy or at steam name you

00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:12,380
could go that way instead so well here's

00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:13,310
my note and if i go back to my front

00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:15,230
page

00:37:13,310 --> 00:37:16,610
I can change that so in that way I can

00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:19,820
like separate it out so basically what

00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:22,970
we did was this has faded up into a

00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:25,190
juicer use the block for that create a

00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:26,810
page that stache front which then Drupal

00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:28,820
thinks it should load because but now

00:37:26,810 --> 00:37:30,290
that it knows this page instead of

00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:32,630
extending its actually loading the

00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:34,490
original page and shoving my pace that

00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:37,340
restaurant into it and then we're going

00:37:34,490 --> 00:37:39,590
to get that so we now have complete

00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:41,000
control over markup we can i play around

00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:43,640
with our pages we can do all this stuff

00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:47,950
and this is kind of where we are we

00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:50,330
happy are we happy yet a little bit okay

00:37:47,950 --> 00:37:51,800
another thing we weren't working on very

00:37:50,330 --> 00:37:53,330
very long and this is like one of the

00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:54,980
key features that can't be in charge of

00:37:53,330 --> 00:37:56,060
heat hide a little bit from people it's

00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:59,540
actually been there for almost a year

00:37:56,060 --> 00:38:02,870
and a half is this call it screenshot 2

00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:06,650
point 0 what screenshot 2 point 0 does

00:38:02,870 --> 00:38:11,630
is this and I can see how I'm defining

00:38:06,650 --> 00:38:13,430
my screenshot and here we go that is my

00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:15,440
scoop that is the biggest feature we put

00:38:13,430 --> 00:38:17,240
into jubilate not removing all the tips

00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:18,380
not removing all their lives I remove

00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:20,350
everything else and give you complete

00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:23,600
control of the mark-up in the CSS no

00:38:20,350 --> 00:38:26,030
animated god damn kittens is going to

00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:29,090
overflow our theme themes that's going

00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:31,220
to be good besides of that how does this

00:38:29,090 --> 00:38:36,290
feel menus and pages in one template

00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:39,470
file so this is the menu this is the

00:38:36,290 --> 00:38:41,420
only thing you need to seem a menu let

00:38:39,470 --> 00:38:44,240
me repeat this this is the only thing

00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:46,310
you have to use menu because you can

00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:49,970
taste and says if when you level shiver

00:38:46,310 --> 00:38:52,640
well L at the class menu Bob if I want

00:38:49,970 --> 00:38:56,360
to add something to level two I can go

00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:58,130
with if menu level equals two and do

00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:59,810
that way I did oh and we can move all

00:38:58,130 --> 00:39:01,970
the way down we could do all those kinds

00:38:59,810 --> 00:39:03,860
of section as using a macro I'm

00:39:01,970 --> 00:39:05,600
kind of two thumb-shaped really really

00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:07,130
understand what this is but one of the

00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:09,470
key points that we talked about when we

00:39:07,130 --> 00:39:10,760
built this thing system was it was more

00:39:09,470 --> 00:39:13,370
important for us when the theme layer

00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:15,620
that you can you can see and feel and

00:39:13,370 --> 00:39:17,780
play around with stuff you're not going

00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:19,040
to break something well so what you're

00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:21,050
sitting on your local environment you

00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:22,670
kind of break stuff of course your but

00:39:21,050 --> 00:39:26,330
that's a feature same thing we've done

00:39:22,670 --> 00:39:27,119
with the menu no pages is another thing

00:39:26,330 --> 00:39:33,289
that always been

00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:37,170
fun for everybody it's like not fun and

00:39:33,289 --> 00:39:38,849
we know it's a little bit long but you

00:39:37,170 --> 00:39:41,009
know this is you have one template now

00:39:38,849 --> 00:39:42,569
for the pager maybe we should use a

00:39:41,009 --> 00:39:44,249
little bit of time to rewrite this to

00:39:42,569 --> 00:39:49,799
something a little bit more usable but

00:39:44,249 --> 00:39:51,930
we have it now into one so let me see

00:39:49,799 --> 00:39:53,789
okay if you already fall asleep now you

00:39:51,930 --> 00:39:55,680
should wake up so we change all these

00:39:53,789 --> 00:39:57,869
things beside of that we also this is

00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:59,940
kind of this train thing you say when by

00:39:57,869 --> 00:40:01,589
the way we fixed it to theaters and but

00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:03,599
when I say this instead that we killed

00:40:01,589 --> 00:40:06,509
support five six seven and eight people

00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:08,460
normally go at you okay like who

00:40:06,509 --> 00:40:11,849
cares about I you six seven and eight we

00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:15,539
fixed the business boys markup I've been

00:40:11,849 --> 00:40:18,450
cleaned up html5 we're using CSS smacks

00:40:15,539 --> 00:40:21,509
and bam name based but we're putting

00:40:18,450 --> 00:40:26,039
modern practices into two plates we're

00:40:21,509 --> 00:40:28,259
not using itsss selectors no because who

00:40:26,039 --> 00:40:31,230
uses AI DS as his latest we've separated

00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:33,960
out the jas so Jes will not interfere if

00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:36,029
you just doing CSS and stuff yeah this

00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:38,309
is pretty much killed ninety percent of

00:40:36,029 --> 00:40:40,799
all of the markup which is rather nice

00:40:38,309 --> 00:40:46,829
and Jake I dependencies removed this

00:40:40,799 --> 00:40:48,599
wall we pushed in and classy and the

00:40:46,829 --> 00:40:50,549
idea behind class is actually when we

00:40:48,599 --> 00:40:52,079
figure out in two years that all the

00:40:50,549 --> 00:40:53,880
stuff we have done for the last three

00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:55,289
years which really really dumb and we

00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:57,539
need to use another way of building of

00:40:55,289 --> 00:41:00,539
themes and we really want to do that we

00:40:57,539 --> 00:41:03,749
can actually built a new theme in classy

00:41:00,539 --> 00:41:06,170
and do a classy 202 class yeah whatever

00:41:03,749 --> 00:41:11,940
kind of dumb name we end up with a

00:41:06,170 --> 00:41:13,589
really bad joke I know note so so these

00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:16,519
are the things that we have done for you

00:41:13,589 --> 00:41:18,960
so far and this let's like NCAA almost

00:41:16,519 --> 00:41:20,819
I'm actually giving myself some time

00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:23,339
I've speeds myself up a little bit

00:41:20,819 --> 00:41:24,779
though at this I know that people have

00:41:23,339 --> 00:41:26,700
listened to me for years have heard me

00:41:24,779 --> 00:41:29,579
yell and scream at a lot of people at

00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:32,640
developers and I'm not sorry for that

00:41:29,579 --> 00:41:35,640
not one bit because we needed to do this

00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:37,859
we needed to to to change what we have

00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:39,470
done for so long time and the good thing

00:41:37,859 --> 00:41:41,200
is that developers wanted that as well

00:41:39,470 --> 00:41:43,119
as you want to

00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:45,609
I want to bring our little salute to the

00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:47,920
people who have participated in this and

00:41:45,609 --> 00:41:49,780
actually I know you're in the room if

00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:53,230
you have ever done anything with with

00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:55,060
this the Drupal trade group yeah we do

00:41:53,230 --> 00:41:57,790
we have to free Rubin jingle cats by the

00:41:55,060 --> 00:42:00,700
way but anyway as you want to have you

00:41:57,790 --> 00:42:05,520
to stand up with me if you help us out

00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:05,520
with this happens then stand up stand up

00:42:05,579 --> 00:42:12,000
face the crowd salute them

00:42:16,539 --> 00:42:21,519
what because know when I look at Jubal

00:42:19,569 --> 00:42:23,919
seven the only thing I want to do is

00:42:21,519 --> 00:42:29,049
ring with a bill and make it a walk

00:42:23,919 --> 00:42:31,179
through the streets um that was 45

00:42:29,049 --> 00:42:34,150
minutes of everything we changed over

00:42:31,179 --> 00:42:36,549
the years before we go further this is

00:42:34,150 --> 00:42:37,719
the link to the theme kite if you want

00:42:36,549 --> 00:42:41,559
to figure out how to actually built this

00:42:37,719 --> 00:42:42,699
stuff coding standards and our CSS it's

00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:45,429
really important if you want to learn

00:42:42,699 --> 00:42:47,199
about smacks going to read that the

00:42:45,429 --> 00:42:48,999
documentation for twig there's a little

00:42:47,199 --> 00:42:51,549
bit more than my two slides by the way

00:42:48,999 --> 00:42:54,640
but you can go pretty far with this and

00:42:51,549 --> 00:42:56,979
a thing we really need now because back

00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:59,019
when we did tuple seven there's no front

00:42:56,979 --> 00:43:01,029
end us besides of poor John Alden who

00:42:59,019 --> 00:43:03,189
worked on Drupal 7 and none of us

00:43:01,029 --> 00:43:05,049
downloaded until six months I have to

00:43:03,189 --> 00:43:07,329
release and they ruined what the is

00:43:05,049 --> 00:43:09,729
this and then we have been working

00:43:07,329 --> 00:43:11,679
with that fella has no five years so if

00:43:09,729 --> 00:43:13,809
you would all three this favor about it

00:43:11,679 --> 00:43:15,549
downloading Drupal 8 I begin to hammer

00:43:13,809 --> 00:43:17,079
on it so we can fix some of the dumb

00:43:15,549 --> 00:43:20,229
stuff I know we go into these candidate

00:43:17,079 --> 00:43:22,449
one in very very very soon but we really

00:43:20,229 --> 00:43:24,009
must have work on this because so far it

00:43:22,449 --> 00:43:25,989
has been a very small group as you saw

00:43:24,009 --> 00:43:27,489
and me be sitting in the corner and

00:43:25,989 --> 00:43:29,619
yelling no no this is wrong we should do

00:43:27,489 --> 00:43:31,959
it this way instead I used to wake up

00:43:29,619 --> 00:43:34,929
and sweat and like thinking oh what

00:43:31,959 --> 00:43:37,359
if I thought this wrong but my ego as a

00:43:34,929 --> 00:43:40,419
biking to go and I think I did nothing

00:43:37,359 --> 00:43:44,019
wrong and I challenge you guys to prove

00:43:40,419 --> 00:43:46,209
me wrong or right I don't really care I

00:43:44,019 --> 00:43:47,679
because we really need we need funding

00:43:46,209 --> 00:43:49,029
us to work with the theme neighbors it's

00:43:47,679 --> 00:43:52,179
going to be a home for the next you know

00:43:49,029 --> 00:43:54,400
maybe five years so all the dumb we

00:43:52,179 --> 00:43:56,529
have done at late Friday nights and

00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:58,719
pushing coding it's mike gonna haunt us

00:43:56,529 --> 00:44:03,759
if we figure out find the stuff now it's

00:43:58,719 --> 00:44:06,789
really going to change it um so any

00:44:03,759 --> 00:44:08,769
questions there's a question down there

00:44:06,789 --> 00:44:11,409
could you run over to that Mike and do

00:44:08,769 --> 00:44:16,059
it or yell it really loud and I can be

00:44:11,409 --> 00:44:19,079
repeated he will work he must be a

00:44:16,059 --> 00:44:23,999
developer because it goes so slow

00:44:19,079 --> 00:44:25,619
I might know this guy if somebody want

00:44:23,999 --> 00:44:27,959
to file a code of conduct on me of

00:44:25,619 --> 00:44:30,779
talking crap of sweets you'll find fair

00:44:27,959 --> 00:44:33,269
to do that it yes I noticed the menu

00:44:30,779 --> 00:44:35,519
level was zero but I'm a human and that

00:44:33,269 --> 00:44:38,700
doesn't work for me why isn't it one I

00:44:35,519 --> 00:44:40,709
can't remember I know that we I've

00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:43,709
removed it at a patch and then somebody

00:44:40,709 --> 00:44:45,719
somebody this too wasn't it you pushed

00:44:43,709 --> 00:44:47,219
somebody pushed the class and I killed

00:44:45,719 --> 00:44:48,420
it at some point and then we got

00:44:47,219 --> 00:44:50,459
complaints because people couldn't

00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:52,589
figure out what we did up to class and i

00:44:50,459 --> 00:44:55,380
answered snuggly back in the issue queue

00:44:52,589 --> 00:44:57,599
that it was a feature and i think i just

00:44:55,380 --> 00:44:59,160
said that she won't fix and somebody was

00:44:57,599 --> 00:45:04,319
a little bit more human not an arrogant

00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:07,259
 it went in I have no idea was that

00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:09,359
was that good enough as you can see the

00:45:07,259 --> 00:45:11,279
the brain behind at the motive behind

00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:15,029
the theme layer has absolute first crazy

00:45:11,279 --> 00:45:16,859
God he has no idea so this is why we

00:45:15,029 --> 00:45:21,059
need you guys to come in and help I've

00:45:16,859 --> 00:45:22,799
need some help also considering scopes

00:45:21,059 --> 00:45:25,559
uses and all that supported isn't it a

00:45:22,799 --> 00:45:27,509
bit risky to attach libraries with CSS

00:45:25,559 --> 00:45:32,130
to templates instead of as a little

00:45:27,509 --> 00:45:34,229
global level well it can't be risky yes

00:45:32,130 --> 00:45:37,019
but if you follow like decency as their

00:45:34,229 --> 00:45:38,759
standards and go with smacks definition

00:45:37,019 --> 00:45:41,130
girl with BIM naming and you actually

00:45:38,759 --> 00:45:44,309
remember to name your stuff correctly

00:45:41,130 --> 00:45:46,859
don't use green class don't do that give

00:45:44,309 --> 00:45:49,440
them names that is like scoped in it

00:45:46,859 --> 00:45:51,209
can't be risky if this is more fair hey

00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:53,999
by the way check this out you can

00:45:51,209 --> 00:45:55,529
actually pack in your slider with your

00:45:53,999 --> 00:45:57,930
slider template and you can attach a

00:45:55,529 --> 00:46:00,569
library and all that connected into one

00:45:57,930 --> 00:46:03,029
folder and so as more of a thought and

00:46:00,569 --> 00:46:05,279
you can also do this stuff you can break

00:46:03,029 --> 00:46:07,559
your theme in a millions ways we're just

00:46:05,279 --> 00:46:10,229
waiting to see it happen we're not

00:46:07,559 --> 00:46:12,449
saying that this system is is is failed

00:46:10,229 --> 00:46:14,489
proved anything else but because

00:46:12,449 --> 00:46:17,369
basically how many how many in here have

00:46:14,489 --> 00:46:19,170
built anything with Drupal 8 yet good

00:46:17,369 --> 00:46:22,769
how many'd like to built in the theme

00:46:19,170 --> 00:46:26,249
system Oh about the same amount so that

00:46:22,769 --> 00:46:27,509
was about what five percent so we don't

00:46:26,249 --> 00:46:30,180
even there's a lot of things we don't

00:46:27,509 --> 00:46:31,979
know yet so yes it is risky pardon I

00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:32,549
mean we're working in the front end I

00:46:31,979 --> 00:46:34,140
mean I'm

00:46:32,549 --> 00:46:36,119
waiting for the next apple keynote at

00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:39,359
Google keynote them to push out another

00:46:36,119 --> 00:46:41,519
thing we have to report I mean I wonder

00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:43,589
when they beginning to get on hello I've

00:46:41,519 --> 00:46:46,739
i watch it when they get a browser

00:46:43,589 --> 00:46:48,599
building I'm gonna be so happy for all

00:46:46,739 --> 00:46:50,489
the work and all that like exam years

00:46:48,599 --> 00:46:52,529
ago by the way what I called that like

00:46:50,489 --> 00:46:55,709
five years ago watches with trousers oh

00:46:52,529 --> 00:46:58,859
yeah it's not gonna be better it's just

00:46:55,709 --> 00:47:05,849
gonna be worse are you done embarrassing

00:46:58,859 --> 00:47:09,209
you know hi um I was just wondering how

00:47:05,849 --> 00:47:11,400
modules if they can provide a markup

00:47:09,209 --> 00:47:13,709
file for both like clean markup we're

00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:15,959
just print ifs and one for classy is

00:47:13,709 --> 00:47:18,089
that possible or how is that minutes no

00:47:15,959 --> 00:47:19,799
at this point is not mad at all what I

00:47:18,089 --> 00:47:21,359
would suggest people do is make sure

00:47:19,799 --> 00:47:22,709
that you push out you know all the

00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:24,329
barrels that you want to create a class

00:47:22,709 --> 00:47:25,859
4 and so for just push it out in the way

00:47:24,329 --> 00:47:27,839
that class you would do it all the way

00:47:25,859 --> 00:47:30,239
actually you're much would do it an idea

00:47:27,839 --> 00:47:31,739
we've had for many many years ago was

00:47:30,239 --> 00:47:34,559
actually creating a group called the

00:47:31,739 --> 00:47:36,959
mark-up Marines mainly because it sounds

00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:38,789
 cool no the idea was actually

00:47:36,959 --> 00:47:41,819
having fun tent nerds who want to help

00:47:38,789 --> 00:47:43,170
developers to create better Markham

00:47:41,819 --> 00:47:45,539
better elements cuz it's not enough just

00:47:43,170 --> 00:47:48,239
to provide the documentation there is

00:47:45,539 --> 00:47:49,920
developers who don't know how CSS words

00:47:48,239 --> 00:47:52,469
or how we work with seasons which is

00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:54,449
perfectly okay it's a skill set that is

00:47:52,469 --> 00:47:58,559
very far away from building your modules

00:47:54,449 --> 00:48:01,229
and so at this point no but I would

00:47:58,559 --> 00:48:02,999
suggest that you jump on some kind of

00:48:01,229 --> 00:48:05,549
social media if your developer and yell

00:48:02,999 --> 00:48:08,400
out help and we're getting more and more

00:48:05,549 --> 00:48:10,920
front enters in we are having the group

00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:13,709
front-end United is getting bigger again

00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:15,599
and we really want to get more people

00:48:13,709 --> 00:48:17,910
involved and I see help out developers

00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:19,289
because this is not the more versus

00:48:17,910 --> 00:48:20,699
developer i know i've put it up put it

00:48:19,289 --> 00:48:22,709
up that way for many years because

00:48:20,699 --> 00:48:24,929
that's how we create a good healthy

00:48:22,709 --> 00:48:27,929
rivalry and you get people entertained

00:48:24,929 --> 00:48:30,630
it you can you can talk crap about other

00:48:27,929 --> 00:48:31,890
people and I think that is fun so no but

00:48:30,630 --> 00:48:33,869
but what we actually need is we need

00:48:31,890 --> 00:48:35,489
people to help our developers we need

00:48:33,869 --> 00:48:37,049
fun dinners who know how to build these

00:48:35,489 --> 00:48:39,689
things so we don't end up having a

00:48:37,049 --> 00:48:40,920
module that has a three border three

00:48:39,689 --> 00:48:43,830
line border around

00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:45,750
you know certain elements and yes I've

00:48:43,830 --> 00:48:48,630
seen that in the module that many people

00:48:45,750 --> 00:48:50,550
have used and it's not good and we can

00:48:48,630 --> 00:48:52,290
make up baseline so much better but at

00:48:50,550 --> 00:48:55,890
this point no there's no way of saying

00:48:52,290 --> 00:48:57,230
class reverses call or stock I call it a

00:48:55,890 --> 00:49:00,360
call because I just think it's called

00:48:57,230 --> 00:49:02,790
but classy is the idea behind separating

00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:04,830
the mark about and class up us that was

00:49:02,790 --> 00:49:06,840
that way we could when we figured out we

00:49:04,830 --> 00:49:08,790
did you wrong with classy we can kind of

00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:10,230
just push it out and we can create a new

00:49:08,790 --> 00:49:12,480
version of pleasure but we actually fix

00:49:10,230 --> 00:49:15,210
it up so we have taken the control and

00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:17,280
move that away from Drupal core where

00:49:15,210 --> 00:49:19,650
everything was living back in the days I

00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:21,480
would I wish that we could take every

00:49:19,650 --> 00:49:24,030
template and move that directly out into

00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:25,650
the theme directory instead but that's

00:49:24,030 --> 00:49:29,760
going to be a bike shed I don't have the

00:49:25,650 --> 00:49:31,560
energy for at this point thanks more

00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:33,420
questions I'm not really off the hook

00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:35,010
yet so you just walked on with questions

00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:38,670
i have a whole hour and i'm gonna fill

00:49:35,010 --> 00:49:41,160
it up all right so there's a couple of

00:49:38,670 --> 00:49:42,780
things here a couple of sessions that

00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:46,230
actually really won't have people to

00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:47,610
come and participate in tomorrow at 1045

00:49:46,230 --> 00:49:49,650
we're going to have a buff because

00:49:47,610 --> 00:49:51,180
there's a bunch of brave Belgians who

00:49:49,650 --> 00:49:53,190
think that we need to move front end

00:49:51,180 --> 00:49:55,140
United to Belgium finally United if you

00:49:53,190 --> 00:49:57,240
don't know about that it's been one of

00:49:55,140 --> 00:49:59,460
the reason that we have done all this

00:49:57,240 --> 00:50:01,500
work because we were trying for small

00:49:59,460 --> 00:50:04,200
about actually ever since drupalcon

00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:06,180
Copenhagen my home city we've tried to

00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:07,290
organize fun tenders and get funds to

00:50:06,180 --> 00:50:09,420
come together and trying to figure out

00:50:07,290 --> 00:50:10,560
how to fix Drupal because you don't get

00:50:09,420 --> 00:50:12,180
anything out of bitching and moaning

00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:13,590
well besides a bitching and moaning

00:50:12,180 --> 00:50:15,900
which can be fun but it's not very

00:50:13,590 --> 00:50:17,670
constructive so we're trying to organize

00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:18,780
people get them together figure out what

00:50:17,670 --> 00:50:21,870
we could do and that's actually how we

00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:23,490
got chicken boss acted by no discussing

00:50:21,870 --> 00:50:25,020
these things playing around with these

00:50:23,490 --> 00:50:27,270
things so tomorrow at seven forty-five

00:50:25,020 --> 00:50:29,280
it's going to be a meeting around the

00:50:27,270 --> 00:50:32,640
next front end United which is a front

00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:34,470
end drupal camp going to be a weekend in

00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:38,580
somewhere in Belgium I'm not really sure

00:50:34,470 --> 00:50:40,470
where but I mean the food is kind of

00:50:38,580 --> 00:50:42,660
French Spanish and German sizes and the

00:50:40,470 --> 00:50:44,730
beers pretty awesome so I mean if it

00:50:42,660 --> 00:50:46,200
goes completely crap we can do we could

00:50:44,730 --> 00:50:48,210
always just eat and drink I have a good

00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:49,620
time now what we actually begin to build

00:50:48,210 --> 00:50:50,970
all of these things as bein to look at

00:50:49,620 --> 00:50:52,950
how we can extend these

00:50:50,970 --> 00:50:55,110
and and what we're also trying to do

00:50:52,950 --> 00:50:58,080
with front-end United is making sure the

00:50:55,110 --> 00:50:59,460
beginning we're not ending up like only

00:50:58,080 --> 00:51:01,500
doing google stuff and patting ourselves

00:50:59,460 --> 00:51:02,880
on the bath be like yes it's so awesome

00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:04,740
with you because there's a lot of other

00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:06,870
things out there and we can explode off

00:51:04,740 --> 00:51:08,640
the island and especially getting people

00:51:06,870 --> 00:51:12,030
trained in what I'm going to do with

00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:14,250
trick care conference camp it's going to

00:51:12,030 --> 00:51:16,560
happen at some point after New Year's

00:51:14,250 --> 00:51:18,360
because we know the next three months

00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:19,680
it's dark and it's cold and it's

00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:24,600
miserable and we don't want to do

00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:26,520
anything um that's Jamal 1045 room 128

00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:28,560
there's a buff there if you do drupal 8

00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:30,870
work and you google seven work and you

00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:33,240
want to figure out how to put this stuff

00:51:30,870 --> 00:51:35,640
into drupal 7 there's a dude actually a

00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:36,870
belgian dude Renee who have done this he

00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:39,600
have messed that stuff and there's a

00:51:36,870 --> 00:51:42,120
session about how he got trick into

00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:44,790
Drupal 7 and I'm just looking forward to

00:51:42,120 --> 00:51:47,600
never touching smelling on knowing about

00:51:44,790 --> 00:51:50,520
Drupal 7 it's been seven years of pure

00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:53,370
hate hate relationship I do not know why

00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:55,110
I still ate but I did and another thing

00:51:53,370 --> 00:51:56,940
is like all week we have one experience

00:51:55,110 --> 00:51:59,220
we do have a critical issue we need to

00:51:56,940 --> 00:52:00,990
fix but it's not so much the critical

00:51:59,220 --> 00:52:02,490
issues also all of the mark-up things

00:52:00,990 --> 00:52:04,380
all that stuff we really need you guys

00:52:02,490 --> 00:52:06,090
to come in and help out look at the code

00:52:04,380 --> 00:52:07,500
figuring out if a template is completely

00:52:06,090 --> 00:52:09,690
unreadable it'll help with the

00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:11,370
documentation so the next person who's

00:52:09,690 --> 00:52:13,290
like burning is spreading himself down

00:52:11,370 --> 00:52:16,530
and figure out know why is the menu

00:52:13,290 --> 00:52:18,090
level 0 why is that well if we know that

00:52:16,530 --> 00:52:20,640
let's put that in this a comment so we

00:52:18,090 --> 00:52:22,740
can actually document that on Friday

00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:24,750
that's going to be the epic sprint day

00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:27,450
because first of all I am expecting us

00:52:24,750 --> 00:52:29,220
to have the I'll see one puck done so we

00:52:27,450 --> 00:52:31,320
can celebrate that but there gonna be a

00:52:29,220 --> 00:52:33,330
bunch of us and we are going to want

00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:35,850
multiple amount of sprints on different

00:52:33,330 --> 00:52:38,280
issues and don't really care about your

00:52:35,850 --> 00:52:39,930
level of expertise in anything in doable

00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:41,730
if you have no idea how to blade works

00:52:39,930 --> 00:52:43,320
that's even better because actually

00:52:41,730 --> 00:52:44,430
having people to download Jubilee try

00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:46,440
and shoot some of these things out

00:52:44,430 --> 00:52:47,430
figuring out to do documentation bail

00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:48,930
and figure out how to do all these

00:52:47,430 --> 00:52:53,520
things it's really really important for

00:52:48,930 --> 00:52:55,740
the project so even more important

00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:57,870
tonight there is a party that all the

00:52:55,740 --> 00:53:00,560
locals in the Spanish community you have

00:52:57,870 --> 00:53:03,260
organized got a ton of sponsors on and I

00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:06,050
I can talk about this for

00:53:03,260 --> 00:53:07,400
months but i will go other do that the

00:53:06,050 --> 00:53:09,680
beer in my hand instead of talking

00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:11,300
directly at you guys and discuss all

00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:13,400
these things so that is where we're

00:53:11,300 --> 00:53:15,230
going to be tonight it's all it's also

00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:17,990
on the website where you can see it's

00:53:15,230 --> 00:53:20,720
put in is like 30 minutes away from here

00:53:17,990 --> 00:53:22,040
on the l4 and i promised you that I

00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:26,060
would put my slides up and I actually

00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:30,650
did china year old / Drupal 8 trick pasa

00:53:26,060 --> 00:53:32,240
this the is my template if you want to

00:53:30,650 --> 00:53:33,710
give me feedback and I would really like

00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:37,250
feedback on the session as soon as the

00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:38,810
session is done and if you go china you

00:53:37,250 --> 00:53:41,300
all the chrome twig feedback you're

00:53:38,810 --> 00:53:42,860
going to be redirected over to the to

00:53:41,300 --> 00:53:45,740
become website and you can give feedback

00:53:42,860 --> 00:53:47,180
on this the reason more besides of its

00:53:45,740 --> 00:53:48,410
it's more fun to get feedback in the

00:53:47,180 --> 00:53:49,610
u.s. because there's always somebody

00:53:48,410 --> 00:53:52,610
would get really offended by my

become try to become better percentage
