Title: DrupalCon Barcelona 2015: Symfony for Drupal developers
Publication date: 2015-09-22
Playlist: DrupalCon Barcelona - September 2015
Description: 
	One of the main advantages of Drupal 8's modernization and adoption of many Symfony components is that it is much easier for developers to jump between Drupal the CMS and Symfony the framework, using "the right tool for the job".  Much of the knowledge and conventions of one translate to the other.
But "much" is not "all", and there are still many differences between these Open Source cousins. This session will be an introduction to developing for Symfony, assuming a Drupal background. (Hint: It involves a lot less button pushing and a lot more coding.)

What similarities can we benefit from, and what differences are there to watch out for?
