Playlist: DrupalCon Barcelona - September 2015
Description: 
	Web agencies often think about building successful products. Making money while you sleep is an exciting prospect for web agencies used to selling hours. 

Making the leap from a successful web agency to a successful product organization is a big one. Common wisdom says that you shouldnâ€™t even think about combining the two. Nevertheless, many of us still try and there are successful examples in our space. 

If you are interested in exploring products as a web firm, this session is a primer on how to do so successfully, including topics like how to balance client work, prioritize development, staff correctly and start earning your first recurring revenue. 

Drew has run a successful web agency, (Gorton Studios), built a successful product (NodeSquirrel) and now works at a highly successful product / PAAS company (Pantheon). Doing all three has given him a unique understanding of the different problems and opportunities involved in each and ideas on how best to approach their different needs.
