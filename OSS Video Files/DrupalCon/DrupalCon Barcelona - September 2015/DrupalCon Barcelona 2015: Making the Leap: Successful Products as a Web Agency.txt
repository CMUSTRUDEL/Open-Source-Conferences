Title: DrupalCon Barcelona 2015: Making the Leap: Successful Products as a Web Agency
Publication date: 2015-09-22
Playlist: DrupalCon Barcelona - September 2015
Description: 
	Web agencies often think about building successful products. Making money while you sleep is an exciting prospect for web agencies used to selling hours. 

Making the leap from a successful web agency to a successful product organization is a big one. Common wisdom says that you shouldnâ€™t even think about combining the two. Nevertheless, many of us still try and there are successful examples in our space. 

If you are interested in exploring products as a web firm, this session is a primer on how to do so successfully, including topics like how to balance client work, prioritize development, staff correctly and start earning your first recurring revenue. 

Drew has run a successful web agency, (Gorton Studios), built a successful product (NodeSquirrel) and now works at a highly successful product / PAAS company (Pantheon). Doing all three has given him a unique understanding of the different problems and opportunities involved in each and ideas on how best to approach their different needs.

all right good afternoon everyone I

00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:07,319
think we'll go ahead and get started

00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:08,910
here so if you haven't already intuited

00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:11,309
this we're talking today about making

00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:15,389
the leap doing successful products as a

00:00:11,309 --> 00:00:18,330
web agency and we'll be talking about a

00:00:15,389 --> 00:00:20,010
few things specifically and it's so for

00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:22,410
warning if this is not what you were

00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:24,449
hoping to have be covered then I will

00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:25,619
not be offended if you leave so we're

00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:27,269
going to be talking about things like

00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:30,000
your motivators and your goals and

00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:31,320
building products wouldn't MVP is in the

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,290
role of marketing and things like that

00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:36,030
we are not going to be talking about how

00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:38,070
to build a product was kind of technical

00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:40,140
frameworks sort of design considerations

00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:42,719
a be testing any of those sort of

00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:44,969
specific techniques on how to build a

00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,320
product so this is a lot more about how

00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:48,960
to think about a product how to plan for

00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,070
a product and how to be able to deliver

00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:55,620
one successfully from a business

00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:56,789
perspective so I think furthermore like

00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:59,699
the people who are going to get the most

00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:01,739
out of this talk are this describes us

00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:03,840
so I'm curious actually just show of

00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:08,549
hands how many of us make things for

00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:11,790
clients yay okay excellent and have an

00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:14,820
idea or a prototype good cool all right

00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:18,780
guys and then we're wondering what to do

00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:21,299
now really oh right all right um good

00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:22,979
okay so i hope this this I think well

00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:25,350
we'll see we've got the right on it's in

00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:29,100
the room so a little bit about myself my

00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:31,829
name is drew gordon and i have a an

00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:33,810
interesting perspective in this so i ran

00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:37,140
a web services forum called gorton

00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:39,630
studios for about 15 years and we did

00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:42,299
full service design development training

00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:44,549
content strategy etc etc for an array of

00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:46,530
clients so it's this small team of

00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:49,860
Vienna programmers and UX people and

00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:51,509
such coming into a client and saying

00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:54,960
what you need and helping plan that and

00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:57,090
build that in and deliver it as that

00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:59,579
agency we also built something called

00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:02,399
node squirrel a node squirrel is a

00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:03,390
backup service that plugs into Drupal so

00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,119
it makes it easy to have off-site

00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:09,149
backups so we were an agency that did

00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:10,560
that and then since then in 2015

00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:14,120
actually just before Drupal con los

00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:17,160
angeles pantheon bought node score

00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:19,710
and the twist in that plot for me was

00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:22,260
when they said drew you should go with

00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:24,120
and join pantheon and I was kind of

00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:26,070
surprised at that and but anyways long

00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,510
story short I did not so I've got this

00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:28,680
breadth of experience I understand what

00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:31,860
it's like to build things for clients

00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:34,650
and I was a team of seven and now i'm up

00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:37,110
to a team of 80 at a products company so

00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:39,210
it's very different worldviews and I'm

00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:40,800
hoping that I can synthesize as much as

00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:43,020
that as possible so that you two can go

00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:49,980
off and be successful and make your own

00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:52,110
leap the conventional wisdom of doing a

00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:53,610
product as a services company how many

00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:57,990
people have heard something like this

00:02:53,610 --> 00:03:00,420
don't do it right oh come on more of us

00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:02,820
have heard that right this is definitely

00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:05,280
i don't know i heard this a lot yet all

00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:09,930
of us are still doing it so good good

00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:14,040
for us that you can do it it's very

00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:16,020
doable unfortunately it's hard and so

00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:18,000
hopefully again what we're talking about

00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:19,950
today will will help you be able to you

00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,270
know have your hands raised and and give

00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:25,020
this session next time at your local

00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:28,050
camp or the next drupalcon there are

00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:29,670
successful examples in our space and in

00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:30,720
preparing for this talk you know those

00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:32,580
of us have been doing this kind of thing

00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,320
we often have conversations but we'll be

00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:36,240
looking at some of these very specific

00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:38,280
examples and advice from folks who have

00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:41,070
done this successfully and so in the

00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:42,510
case of Pantheon for example was founded

00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:43,860
by some of the founders of both for

00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:45,660
kitchens in chapter three who are web

00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:47,610
agencies doing the same thing as like

00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:49,590
gorton studios lullaby is just a

00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:51,120
fantastic agency that's been around for

00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:54,390
a very long time they made something

00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,260
called Drupal eyes me and that's a based

00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:58,110
off of the sort of like training

00:03:55,260 --> 00:04:00,330
expertise that they built so it's a it's

00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:04,770
a great service and we actually have

00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:07,080
addy hi hi addy and we'll see some of

00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:08,340
her advice he recession gorton studios

00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:11,100
obviously made notes girl I've already

00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:13,260
talked about that callum una may is an

00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:15,420
agency based in the San Francisco Bay

00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:17,549
Area and they make something called cala

00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:19,739
box which is a local development

00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:22,080
environment that is more modern than

00:04:19,739 --> 00:04:24,830
same amp so if you have local

00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:26,900
development environment sort of needs

00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:28,340
and are wondering how to solve those you

00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:30,830
should take a look at cala box it's like

00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:32,500
pop it in and it's got you know best

00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:34,430
practices container based architecture

00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:36,680
optimized you know things like varnish

00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:39,919
and and a whole tool stack there for

00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:43,819
doing really good development phase two

00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:45,949
is another agency about 150 people

00:04:43,819 --> 00:04:48,139
they're based in the US but they have

00:04:45,949 --> 00:04:49,610
people all around the world and they

00:04:48,139 --> 00:04:51,520
maintain a number of distributions

00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:56,919
including one that's called open publish

00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:58,879
which is for publishers basically as a

00:04:56,919 --> 00:05:02,000
starting it's a distribution dribble

00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:04,370
distribution for intended to be used by

00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,770
publishers and media people and then

00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:08,300
probiotics and we have christoph i think

00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:10,310
somewhere in the room as well the

00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:11,629
another small firm that has gone off and

00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:13,639
made something called walk up which is

00:05:11,629 --> 00:05:15,409
for documenting websites and having you

00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:17,719
know guided tours and the ability sort

00:05:15,409 --> 00:05:20,900
of click through and have a self

00:05:17,719 --> 00:05:22,550
documenting interface um so we're going

00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:25,129
to see you know lessons from all of

00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:26,779
these folks and hopefully again

00:05:25,129 --> 00:05:28,189
synthesizing a lot of the conversations

00:05:26,779 --> 00:05:32,060
that many of us have had over the years

00:05:28,189 --> 00:05:34,039
about these things and and another

00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:36,620
resource so we'll have all of those

00:05:34,039 --> 00:05:38,150
people helping guide this things but one

00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:43,039
of the things i also want to point out

00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:44,810
is a lot of these ideas are from a kind

00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:46,879
of startup called lean startups also

00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:50,719
like this the the notion if you're not

00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:52,819
familiar with the idea of a lean startup

00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:55,460
and you're sitting here you should be so

00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:57,740
i would really recommend this site lean

00:05:55,460 --> 00:06:01,460
stack calm in particular has lots of

00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:03,440
great articles this book recommendation

00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:05,690
actually came to me via Ryan Strama who

00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:08,300
gave a talk in some ways it's similar to

00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:10,190
this at drupa con Latin America so again

00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:11,120
that this topic interests you I would

00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:14,810
encourage you to check out these

00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:17,629
resources as well again I'm going to try

00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:18,860
and take all of that and present in a

00:06:17,629 --> 00:06:20,349
way that I think makes sense for all of

00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:24,529
us with a sort of shared background of

00:06:20,349 --> 00:06:25,639
building things for clients and and

00:06:24,529 --> 00:06:29,240
these are the things I want to talk

00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:32,089
about so before you start a product you

00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:35,740
need to define some things and all of us

00:06:32,089 --> 00:06:35,740
who didn't do some of these things

00:06:36,449 --> 00:06:43,259
wished we had so specifically if you

00:06:41,129 --> 00:06:46,319
don't know what your goals are for the

00:06:43,259 --> 00:06:47,819
product it's going to be really hard to

00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:50,009
figure out if you're doing the right

00:06:47,819 --> 00:06:51,990
thing and being very explicit about

00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:54,240
those goals and likewise once you've got

00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:56,400
those goals from there saying what is

00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:59,669
success going to be what will we call

00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:02,189
success if you're and we'll dive into

00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:03,779
each of these things how are you going

00:07:02,189 --> 00:07:05,719
to fund it how are you going to resource

00:07:03,779 --> 00:07:09,539
it what are these methods going to be

00:07:05,719 --> 00:07:12,300
MVP the Minimum Viable Product what's

00:07:09,539 --> 00:07:14,490
the smallest version of that thing that

00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:15,779
you can build this one I think for all

00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:17,819
of us I mean all of these are

00:07:15,779 --> 00:07:21,810
challenging but as people who build

00:07:17,819 --> 00:07:25,589
things for others understanding the MVP

00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:29,279
and and actually getting to minimum

00:07:25,589 --> 00:07:30,870
viable product is very hard I think we

00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:33,300
have a tendency as people who make

00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:34,740
things when we in the vacuum what we're

00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:37,620
going to do is make more things and

00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:41,009
that's actually not really good for a

00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:42,360
product and then another thing that I

00:07:41,009 --> 00:07:46,349
think is a blank spot for many of us is

00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:47,550
marketing we understand maybe so you

00:07:46,349 --> 00:07:50,819
know like maybe that we understand that

00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:53,490
word but the the critical importance of

00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:56,399
marketing in a product is you you just

00:07:53,490 --> 00:08:00,270
cannot underestimate how important that

00:07:56,399 --> 00:08:01,860
is for your long-term success so let's

00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:07,169
dive into goal so I think there's a

00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:10,199
number of motivators for why we attempt

00:08:07,169 --> 00:08:13,199
products and if you understand your

00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:14,849
motivators it will help you know how to

00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:16,439
make decisions so this is pretty basic

00:08:14,849 --> 00:08:19,199
but I think it's the right place to

00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:21,749
start no your goals and I think there's

00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:24,300
really six goals as I you know I've

00:08:21,749 --> 00:08:26,909
talked with others of that that

00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:27,990
influence is so fun obviously fun is you

00:08:26,909 --> 00:08:29,610
know like if you're just doing this as

00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:31,229
yourself you just knew nights and

00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:33,750
weekends you're having fun doing it

00:08:31,229 --> 00:08:35,819
that's great organizationally you might

00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:37,319
call fun something like we have been

00:08:35,819 --> 00:08:39,269
working on this long project and it's

00:08:37,319 --> 00:08:41,010
been a bit of a slog and the team is not

00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:43,019
very motivated we're going to give them

00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:45,899
something enjoyable to do the product

00:08:43,019 --> 00:08:48,500
can help fill that space learning is

00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:50,150
again its own reward we are

00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:51,530
neurology we like to learn we probably

00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:53,270
you know by virtually probably

00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:55,250
self-selected this industry because we

00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:57,320
enjoy learning but also if we don't

00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:59,780
continue learning new things we quickly

00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:02,660
go stale and that is a very big problem

00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:04,400
for our professional careers sometimes

00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:07,400
products are response to an internal

00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:09,470
need so we wanted to build this thing

00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:10,600
because we were really tired of all the

00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:14,000
time and effort we are spending

00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:15,800
recreating it every time that's an

00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,180
example ii Cala box started like that

00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:19,250
and essentially Pantheon did as well

00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:22,420
which came out of a number of projects

00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:27,530
that were you know big early Drupal

00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:30,190
major sites lead generation is all about

00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:33,620
putting something out into the world and

00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:35,530
saying it's by us and then people seeing

00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:37,460
it and saying like oh I like this thing

00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:40,330
I'm going to contact those people

00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:42,760
because I want something similar so

00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:45,530
getting out there is it's a sales tool

00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:47,720
and closely related that to that is

00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:50,330
something you know thought leadership so

00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:53,000
thought leadership being demonstrating

00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:54,800
that you are the people who deeply

00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,270
understand drupal and something else for

00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:59,660
example or whatever it is the whatever

00:09:56,270 --> 00:10:01,280
your idea or prototype it is underst you

00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:02,420
are you're you're putting your stamp on

00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:05,570
that saying we're the people who

00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:08,089
understand drupal magento integration or

00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:09,650
something like that that's thought

00:10:08,089 --> 00:10:11,690
leadership anybody wants to have like

00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:15,020
the best drupal magento integration

00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:17,240
they're going to find you and and the

00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:19,280
last one is profit not all products will

00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:22,040
seek profit but those that do have some

00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:25,280
important considerations they all have

00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:28,160
downsides however so we kind of talked

00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:32,600
about the nice things the cons here like

00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:34,670
fun if you're only so essentially if you

00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:37,160
are only doing a product for one or two

00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:39,350
of these reasons I would say that you

00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:41,390
are in danger right if you can have a

00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:44,990
product that it you know tix like four

00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:46,490
of these that's fantastic five and six I

00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:48,350
don't even that would be mind-blowing if

00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:50,990
you could get all six of these into your

00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:52,280
idea you should definitely do it so I

00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:54,110
would say that you know the more of

00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:56,180
these that you have the better because

00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:58,820
it turns out if you're doing it just for

00:10:56,180 --> 00:11:01,139
fun as soon as it's not fun you're going

00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:03,329
to be done and it will be not fun

00:11:01,139 --> 00:11:06,269
there will definitely be not fun and

00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:09,989
creating a product downside of learning

00:11:06,269 --> 00:11:12,149
is focus the world is a big place there

00:11:09,989 --> 00:11:14,670
are so many technologies so many things

00:11:12,149 --> 00:11:17,819
that you can learn just wandering out in

00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:19,799
learning things you know you can lose

00:11:17,819 --> 00:11:21,839
focus with that and it's not the most

00:11:19,799 --> 00:11:24,470
efficient way to learn frankly building

00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:28,350
a product but there can be something

00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:29,970
internal need solving that problem that

00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:32,149
you you just really want this great

00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:35,759
solution you understand it really well

00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:37,319
again a product with like a logo and

00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:40,499
branding and something that other people

00:11:37,319 --> 00:11:42,689
can use is a lot more overhead than just

00:11:40,499 --> 00:11:43,859
simply building it something building i

00:11:42,689 --> 00:11:45,569
think we probably all know this building

00:11:43,859 --> 00:11:50,189
something for yourself is a lot easier

00:11:45,569 --> 00:11:52,470
than building it for someone else lead

00:11:50,189 --> 00:11:55,499
generation the the problem with lead

00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:58,679
generation is that the clients that you

00:11:55,499 --> 00:12:00,749
tend to get with a free or very low cost

00:11:58,679 --> 00:12:03,059
version are people who want free a

00:12:00,749 --> 00:12:06,350
little bit very low cost things and so

00:12:03,059 --> 00:12:08,730
to go out and you know offer something

00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:10,919
that is free and that you know will get

00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:12,389
widely distributed most of the people

00:12:10,919 --> 00:12:13,679
who are really interested in it are

00:12:12,389 --> 00:12:15,809
going to want the free thing and they

00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:18,929
might contact you and think like I want

00:12:15,809 --> 00:12:22,110
one of these but the amount of people

00:12:18,929 --> 00:12:24,629
who can afford your services will be a

00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:28,739
very small percentage of that of that

00:12:24,629 --> 00:12:29,790
group the problem with thought

00:12:28,739 --> 00:12:31,769
leadership or the thing that you'll have

00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:34,319
to solve for with thought leadership the

00:12:31,769 --> 00:12:36,779
con is the burden of maintenance so if

00:12:34,319 --> 00:12:39,119
you go out and say that you are the best

00:12:36,779 --> 00:12:41,339
year the experts in Drupal magento

00:12:39,119 --> 00:12:44,819
integration use that example again if

00:12:41,339 --> 00:12:46,619
that starts not being a very good like

00:12:44,819 --> 00:12:48,509
you don't maintain the modules or the

00:12:46,619 --> 00:12:51,629
distributions or things like that all of

00:12:48,509 --> 00:12:53,579
the sudden it's the opposite right you

00:12:51,629 --> 00:12:55,019
can charge higher rates perhaps because

00:12:53,579 --> 00:12:57,209
you have this thought leadership

00:12:55,019 --> 00:12:58,350
position but if you don't stay on top of

00:12:57,209 --> 00:12:59,819
it you don't release the Drupal 8

00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:02,220
version you don't fix the bugs you know

00:12:59,819 --> 00:13:03,419
etc all of the sudden you're naked it's

00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:05,369
a double-edged sword it's a negative

00:13:03,419 --> 00:13:08,519
it's a it's a weight on your on your

00:13:05,369 --> 00:13:09,869
firm and for those of us who are

00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:12,539
interested in making money with these

00:13:09,869 --> 00:13:14,880
things I guarantee you you will make

00:13:12,539 --> 00:13:17,520
less money than if you were to do

00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:19,830
service right all of us in this room are

00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:21,480
here as services companies and we're

00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:24,900
successful enough to go to Barcelona

00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:27,480
Spain and come to a conference and spend

00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:31,680
time that we're not billing we know how

00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:34,500
to do services really well if your

00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:35,940
hourly rate is say a thought you say

00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:37,950
lets you charge a hundred dollars an

00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:40,170
hour and so if you would spend a

00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:41,340
thousand hours working for a client you

00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:45,930
would get a hundred thousand dollars

00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:48,240
just round numbers if you spent that

00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:50,160
instead on a product you spent that a

00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:53,250
thousand hours on the product you would

00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:55,070
have zero dollars zero dollars a hundred

00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:57,870
thousand dollars you will get more money

00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:59,340
making a service are you sorry charging

00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:02,160
your clients for a service the the

00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:03,540
hopeful thing is that you can charge for

00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,640
it enough and enough and enough enough

00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:08,910
enough way off in the future that you

00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:11,940
could get a million but it is a long

00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:13,500
time between now and then and that you

00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:16,860
really need to understand that there is

00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:19,320
no get-rich-quick scheme you're already

00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:22,890
in it we have you know all of us know

00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:24,930
how to do services we're again so now I

00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:27,030
would say so in the nodes grill example

00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:28,530
we actually did a good job of this we

00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:31,620
sat down and said like what are the

00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:33,540
things that we really care about fun

00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:34,650
learning and profit that was what we

00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:37,530
were up to you know there's a little bit

00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:40,070
of internal need there but again it was

00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:42,720
sort of overkill so this is how we

00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:44,850
prioritize the world but different you

00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:47,240
know products have different sort of

00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:50,070
rankings here so open publish which is a

00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:51,810
distribution again for the publishers

00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:54,000
it's about lead generation and thought

00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:55,860
leadership allows phase two to stand out

00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,510
in the market and have a lot of those

00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:59,790
kinds of clients contact them and then

00:14:57,510 --> 00:15:01,710
when they do to be able to charge a

00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:06,870
premium because they say we understand

00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:09,810
the space so well so be clear about why

00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:13,470
you're doing something and once you've

00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:16,800
got the wise you need to also take some

00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:18,480
time to define success again many of us

00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:23,610
who didn't do a really good job of this

00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:26,130
a wish that we had so if you don't know

00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:27,240
you're going it's a good chance you're

00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:28,220
not going to arrive you're going to

00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:31,540
spend time wandering

00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:34,010
around making weird decisions and

00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:36,860
eventually either maybe you'll make it I

00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:38,810
think there are many many many more

00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:40,250
examples and for all of the the positive

00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:43,160
examples that we have there there are a

00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:45,470
lot of non examples of people who

00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:48,020
started down the path had an idea made

00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:48,980
it a little ways and then you know they

00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:50,000
didn't have the goals in heaven

00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:51,410
motivations didn't know where they're

00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,940
going whatever reason they make it

00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:55,280
through I think one of the things that

00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:57,860
is easy to get lost on is if you don't

00:15:55,280 --> 00:16:00,380
have your success criteria map down

00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:01,940
we're going to have you know this many

00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:04,160
users by this amount of time or we're

00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:06,830
going to have you know we want if its

00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:09,620
lead generation we want a thousand leads

00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:11,120
in the next year or whatever it is come

00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:13,670
up with something you can change your

00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:16,070
mind later that's okay but know at least

00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:17,240
what you're judging yourself against

00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:19,760
because you're going to have hard

00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:22,250
decisions there will be times what you

00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:24,140
think is this worth it alright this is

00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:26,360
great I've learned some things we've

00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:30,290
tried some things do we keep doing it

00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:32,360
and that's a constant question if you

00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:35,200
can't come back to this sort of like

00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:40,370
what our goals how are we doing then

00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:41,570
it's a hard question to answer so if you

00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:43,160
know the question things like we should

00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:44,690
we actually i'm just going to do

00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:46,460
everyone a favor should we add a new

00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:49,970
feature could be a question you might

00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:52,670
ask yourself the answer is no do not add

00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:55,160
a new feature don't do that if you're in

00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:56,360
this room you should you know like we're

00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:59,090
all still figuring this out the answer

00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:00,740
is no no new features sponsor drupalcon

00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:04,220
that'd be great but you know figuring

00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:08,350
out all kinds of things your definition

00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:12,740
of success is going to be critical and

00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:15,560
and here actually in the words of addy

00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:17,480
who is in the room so this was you know

00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:19,190
i won't i won't read that although

00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:22,180
that's i'll let it you can all read

00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:24,980
faster than i would say it out loud

00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:29,900
there's a danger in not having this

00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:32,930
figured out not only for the product but

00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:35,530
for your agency so that having a limping

00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:39,410
half baked product inside your company

00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:40,900
can really mess with people so not only

00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:43,480
can it be you know sorta like

00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:45,670
a distraction of time and money it can

00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:48,000
also like why are we doing this cause

00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:52,180
sort of fundamental problems and such so

00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:53,260
again know where you're going you're

00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:59,320
going to have a much better chance of

00:17:53,260 --> 00:18:01,300
getting there how you get there there's

00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:03,580
really only a few choices and again each

00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:05,260
of these are going to have downsides you

00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:07,510
know upsides and downsides nights and

00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:09,580
weekends right we all have those we have

00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:11,440
times when we're not working being able

00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:14,410
to just work on a product during that

00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:17,230
time always an option free time inside

00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:20,050
of your firm is another thing like we

00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:22,060
have free time right where we aren't

00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:25,540
always working every single second for a

00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:28,150
client so the ability to use some that

00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:31,780
time to work on a product is great that

00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:34,150
works or you can spend money you can buy

00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:36,190
either your own internal time hire

00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:38,020
someone internally maybe to be devoted

00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:42,390
to it or hire someone externally as a

00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:47,080
contractor you these are the options and

00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:49,240
the downsides though is that while you

00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:52,150
have you know time and you have money

00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:54,790
you don't have enough because whatever

00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:57,450
it is you are going to be super tempted

00:18:54,790 --> 00:19:00,670
to you know it's you don't have enough

00:18:57,450 --> 00:19:03,460
all by itself and well nights and

00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:05,920
weekends line up for sort of like the

00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:08,620
fun and learning kinds of things if your

00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:12,310
goals include business objectives like

00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:15,100
thought leadership and sales leads and

00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:17,740
things like that doing it in nights and

00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:22,810
weekends is going to lose its charm very

00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:25,750
quickly so note squirrel the way we did

00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:27,690
it we we did our free time and the

00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:31,390
downside of that is it took us forever

00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:33,790
it was it was not good we spent a little

00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:36,280
bit of money but mostly it was free time

00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:41,350
and it was a struggle it was a really

00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:44,190
big struggle so did someone have a

00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:48,520
question that they started there alright

00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:53,779
so Alec who's not here but again Calla

00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:56,629
box this the tool for local development

00:19:53,779 --> 00:19:58,309
if you if it's not directly symbiotic

00:19:56,629 --> 00:20:00,739
start treating it as a separate business

00:19:58,309 --> 00:20:04,070
immediately even if you haven't formed a

00:20:00,739 --> 00:20:06,799
new entity around it make sure you

00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:16,639
understand how you're going to get there

00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:18,379
and take it seriously so once you kind

00:20:16,639 --> 00:20:22,009
of know like these sort of intellectual

00:20:18,379 --> 00:20:26,389
questions what are my goals and what's

00:20:22,009 --> 00:20:29,539
my success criteria you need to focus on

00:20:26,389 --> 00:20:31,700
the Minimum Viable Product and if the

00:20:29,539 --> 00:20:34,869
the term MVP is not one you're familiar

00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:37,460
with go Google that do a lot of reading

00:20:34,869 --> 00:20:39,259
again some of the lean stacks other

00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:40,909
resources and such but a Minimum Viable

00:20:39,259 --> 00:20:43,099
Product is I really like this definition

00:20:40,909 --> 00:20:46,849
is the smallest thing that you can build

00:20:43,099 --> 00:20:48,979
that delivers customer value and you

00:20:46,849 --> 00:20:52,190
know bonus if you can capture some of

00:20:48,979 --> 00:20:58,789
that back even better and that's meaning

00:20:52,190 --> 00:21:00,739
can you charge for it and this one I

00:20:58,789 --> 00:21:02,389
think is really really hard i already

00:21:00,739 --> 00:21:03,769
mentioned this for all of us who build

00:21:02,389 --> 00:21:05,509
things for a living we know how to build

00:21:03,769 --> 00:21:08,509
things we maybe have you know interface

00:21:05,509 --> 00:21:10,820
sort of like we think we we have we have

00:21:08,509 --> 00:21:12,979
well formed opinions about all kinds of

00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:14,599
things in building things the Minimum

00:21:12,979 --> 00:21:17,779
Viable Product I guarantee you is

00:21:14,599 --> 00:21:19,129
smaller than you think it is the minimum

00:21:17,779 --> 00:21:21,499
viable product that we built per node

00:21:19,129 --> 00:21:24,619
squirrel was a lot bigger than it needed

00:21:21,499 --> 00:21:26,330
to be it was it it was a medium ly

00:21:24,619 --> 00:21:31,820
viable product and probably every sense

00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:36,320
of the word so and again everyone

00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:38,089
everyone has ever attempted this has has

00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:40,129
this wisdom to share make it smaller

00:21:38,089 --> 00:21:41,509
right and i hope to challenge you

00:21:40,129 --> 00:21:43,429
actually with a with an idea of what's

00:21:41,509 --> 00:21:45,409
even smaller could be but christoph

00:21:43,429 --> 00:21:48,979
who's actually sitting in the back over

00:21:45,409 --> 00:21:50,629
there said it really quite well you're

00:21:48,979 --> 00:21:52,339
your own worst enemy i think this really

00:21:50,629 --> 00:21:53,690
applies to those of us again who are

00:21:52,339 --> 00:21:55,159
sick you know in the context of

00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:58,359
drupalcon where we build things for

00:21:55,159 --> 00:22:03,259
people we are our own worst enemies

00:21:58,359 --> 00:22:04,729
feature itÃ­s is not good adding a new

00:22:03,259 --> 00:22:07,590
feature to try and make the product

00:22:04,729 --> 00:22:08,820
better is almost always

00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:10,950
to try and make the product more viable

00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:13,169
is almost always the wrong choice it

00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:15,840
might need more marketing it might need

00:22:13,169 --> 00:22:22,919
a lot of things but it probably doesn't

00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:25,470
need a new feature so getting to the MVP

00:22:22,919 --> 00:22:26,429
involves a number of things you need to

00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:29,370
know what the problem is that you're

00:22:26,429 --> 00:22:30,779
solving you should have an identity like

00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:33,600
it's going to have it's a product it

00:22:30,779 --> 00:22:36,059
needs a name if you're a fancy you can

00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:37,529
give it a logo a color scheme and a

00:22:36,059 --> 00:22:40,710
brand identity and all of those kinds of

00:22:37,529 --> 00:22:43,190
things but even that can be thinner you

00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:45,990
need to understand your audience and

00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:49,020
have an idea of how you're going to

00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:51,059
reach that audience that one again for

00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:53,490
us and I think for many people again is

00:22:51,059 --> 00:22:54,390
a tricky one and then finally you're

00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:56,159
going to need to figure out what the

00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:57,090
pricing is going to be if you don't

00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:58,830
figure it you're going to have a lot of

00:22:57,090 --> 00:23:00,809
questions about it if you know it's free

00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:05,070
or not is there a free version if there

00:23:00,809 --> 00:23:06,899
is not free versions etc so again for an

00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:09,960
old squirrel if the problem was off-site

00:23:06,899 --> 00:23:11,340
backup and we came up we had a name we

00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,990
came up with the name node squirrel we

00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:15,809
had a brand in a logo and it still

00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:17,700
exists actually an audit are our

00:23:15,809 --> 00:23:19,830
audience was anyone using a Drupal site

00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:21,990
our path to market we were super

00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:23,789
fortunate back up in my grade is a

00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:26,549
module that's widely used already and

00:23:23,789 --> 00:23:27,630
that's a module that we maintain and we

00:23:26,549 --> 00:23:29,730
came up with it's going to be five

00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:31,799
dollars had to just sort of pick numbers

00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:33,960
it's now free actually and sort of like

00:23:31,799 --> 00:23:36,690
a sidebar once Pantheon bought node

00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:38,520
squirrel it made notes cool the base to

00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:41,640
your free so if you don't have a

00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:44,399
reliable off-site backup for your

00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:46,980
various sites you know just go create a

00:23:44,399 --> 00:23:52,770
free account its free forever and you

00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:55,130
can backup your site so we produced as

00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:59,700
part of that so getting two nodes girl

00:23:55,130 --> 00:24:03,590
we produced a website and all a whole

00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:07,770
lot of work to get to this i would say

00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:10,950
doing a different if our motivators had

00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:12,419
been purely profit there's actually

00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:15,059
something that was like the first time I

00:24:12,419 --> 00:24:18,179
heard about it I was actually really

00:24:15,059 --> 00:24:20,460
taken back by it the idea that actually

00:24:18,179 --> 00:24:21,100
what your MVP is looks maybe more like

00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:22,570
this

00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:23,980
and this is antithetical perhaps to

00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:27,610
again the way many of us approach a

00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:29,500
problem the idea that if you're building

00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:31,270
node squirrel the right place to start

00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:32,230
is not engineering it and building it in

00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:33,850
the back of a magnet and do all those

00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:38,380
things what you need is a landing page

00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:41,440
that says note squirrel back up yay and

00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:44,169
it has a button on it that says try now

00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:46,240
or by now or whatever it is you build up

00:24:44,169 --> 00:24:49,690
age sort of talking about what what this

00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:51,820
thing is you have a uniform it goes to

00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:53,409
on the other side you get people to it

00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:55,270
via Google Adwords or something like

00:24:53,409 --> 00:24:57,280
that and then you have some metrics

00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:58,690
something that's tracking how many times

00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:02,289
somebody clicked on this and clicked on

00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:04,990
that they click on sign up now at five

00:25:02,289 --> 00:25:08,049
dollars a month or whatever it is they

00:25:04,990 --> 00:25:09,850
get to the page it says thank you we're

00:25:08,049 --> 00:25:13,059
so glad you're interested in our product

00:25:09,850 --> 00:25:14,380
it'll be out soon and a nice email and

00:25:13,059 --> 00:25:16,210
you have their email address will send

00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:19,840
you an email as soon as it's ready to go

00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:21,850
and that's all and when I first heard

00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:25,809
about that I thought that that was just

00:25:21,850 --> 00:25:27,520
like I didn't like it it was you know it

00:25:25,809 --> 00:25:29,650
feels a little bit like you're promising

00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:32,200
something I had problems with it but in

00:25:29,650 --> 00:25:34,330
the years since you know sort of made

00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:35,650
known squirrel in like I heard that

00:25:34,330 --> 00:25:39,600
maybe a year or two into the product

00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:42,970
project I wish I'd heard it sooner

00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:45,190
because it is such as it would have been

00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:48,730
such a shortcut to a lot of learning

00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:51,250
that a you know hopefully it's something

00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:53,710
you know the Minimum Viable Product

00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:56,200
could be a lot smaller and it might not

00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:57,700
actually involve a lot of the amazing

00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:59,440
talents that we in this room have

00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:02,110
there's not a lot of programming here

00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:05,370
there's some design there's but like

00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:08,919
this is a shockingly small thing and

00:26:05,370 --> 00:26:11,500
really anyone can do it and so I think

00:26:08,919 --> 00:26:15,130
for all of us having the discipline to

00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:17,880
try to be as small as possible is really

00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:21,720
the thing that we all have to focus on

00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:25,210
and that brings us to the next problem

00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:29,650
you need customers more than features

00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:32,110
and this is really really true and we're

00:26:29,650 --> 00:26:33,429
going to want to just dumb try to

00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:34,669
demonstrate this we're going to see you

00:26:33,429 --> 00:26:37,039
live demo time

00:26:34,669 --> 00:26:38,480
so how many of you all right so managed

00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:40,100
roopa websites actually already heard

00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:42,320
that but how many people manage drupal

00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:44,539
websites great all right most everybody

00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:45,590
how many before now before I started

00:26:44,539 --> 00:26:46,519
yammering and before reading the

00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:49,340
sessions are different how many of you

00:26:46,519 --> 00:26:50,389
had heard of nodes squirrel ok cool Wow

00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:52,220
oh this is going to go well all right

00:26:50,389 --> 00:26:54,529
how many of you knew what it was at

00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:55,820
least bagley like I knew it was in you

00:26:54,529 --> 00:26:57,679
know like you've--you the word back up

00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:58,999
all right how many of you thought it was

00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:00,379
a good idea for and I should be I'm

00:26:58,999 --> 00:27:02,720
sorry I should be like listing this out

00:27:00,379 --> 00:27:04,070
so I manage Drupal websites most

00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:05,299
everybody in the room heard of node

00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:06,470
squirrel is actually pretty good like i

00:27:05,299 --> 00:27:09,109
would say eighty percent of the room

00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:10,399
knew what it was sixty percent how many

00:27:09,109 --> 00:27:12,499
thought it was a great idea maybe said

00:27:10,399 --> 00:27:14,059
something nice about it so we're down to

00:27:12,499 --> 00:27:16,429
twenty percent of them so like I how

00:27:14,059 --> 00:27:21,169
many of you tried it dropping quickly

00:27:16,429 --> 00:27:23,690
right good how many of you bought it 22

00:27:21,169 --> 00:27:25,159
to that's actually that statistically

00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:27,409
asked what I was hoping for actually I

00:27:25,159 --> 00:27:29,840
thought two to three that's about right

00:27:27,409 --> 00:27:31,879
and here we are in the you know the

00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:34,070
place in the world right now with the

00:27:31,879 --> 00:27:36,950
deepest fullest concentration of our

00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:39,769
audience and we had some you know like

00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:42,799
we have a lot of you know nice press

00:27:39,769 --> 00:27:44,989
about us and such the world's a big

00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:46,960
place there's a lot of messages and

00:27:44,989 --> 00:27:49,340
going the the difference between

00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:52,999
specifically thought it was a great idea

00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:55,279
which was maybe twenty percent to bought

00:27:52,999 --> 00:27:57,679
it which is about two is really

00:27:55,279 --> 00:28:00,220
interesting if someone tells you that's

00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:03,649
a great idea I really want to use it

00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:06,230
they might not actually want to use it

00:28:03,649 --> 00:28:07,460
they might just be polite or they'll

00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:09,499
think they you know they might actually

00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:11,869
think that they would but when it comes

00:28:09,499 --> 00:28:15,249
to it like other things to do today not

00:28:11,869 --> 00:28:19,700
going to happen and this is this is

00:28:15,249 --> 00:28:23,359
where marketing is so again many of us

00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:25,369
in small firms don't have a dedicated

00:28:23,359 --> 00:28:27,889
marketing person and maybe just don't

00:28:25,369 --> 00:28:33,769
have like a deep understanding for what

00:28:27,889 --> 00:28:36,679
it means to do marketing so you know at

00:28:33,769 --> 00:28:39,139
the business session yesterday we had a

00:28:36,679 --> 00:28:40,249
conversation and I recognized one of the

00:28:39,139 --> 00:28:42,049
people might tell exactly we were

00:28:40,249 --> 00:28:43,759
talking about this so is all the

00:28:42,049 --> 00:28:45,830
instalike the business summit yesterday

00:28:43,759 --> 00:28:47,659
and so a lot of people you know running

00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:48,450
businesses and such we're talking about

00:28:47,659 --> 00:28:50,760
how big

00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:52,320
team before you actually need a full

00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:54,270
time marketing person and week the

00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:56,190
consensus we came to is about 25 to 30

00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:57,480
people and then you know that's the

00:28:56,190 --> 00:28:59,940
point at which full time marketing is

00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:01,320
makes sense and that's somebody's just

00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:04,800
focusing on getting out messages and

00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:06,210
like making sure you're visible and I

00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:08,370
think that ratio is about right it's

00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:10,950
like 130 like you should not start

00:29:08,370 --> 00:29:13,290
marketing you know things at you know 30

00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:14,910
people but that's the point at which

00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:18,690
it's enough for a full time person's

00:29:14,910 --> 00:29:20,550
brain with the product I think that

00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:22,290
answer is closer to four nodes squirrel

00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:25,350
did not actually make it to a

00:29:22,290 --> 00:29:27,780
four-person team before we join pantheon

00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:30,780
but if we had made it to four and one of

00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:33,300
them wasn't in marketing I would have

00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:38,490
been an idiot I might not who knows you

00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:40,350
know having gone to pantheon it's really

00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:43,320
interesting for me so Pantheon is a team

00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:46,380
of about 80 people right now and there

00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:48,000
are three major disciplines there's well

00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:50,640
the three biggest disciplines are

00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,500
engineering which is about 20 and

00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:56,280
they're similar in size about 20 ish

00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:57,960
people support you know people helping

00:29:56,280 --> 00:30:01,170
people use the platform answer tickets

00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:04,470
etc about 20 people and marketing about

00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:06,540
20 ish people like it's about a quarter

00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:07,740
of what we do by a number of human

00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:10,860
beings and the rest there's there's

00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:13,100
folks in sales there's folks in HR and

00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:15,990
other things and the leadership and such

00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:19,950
but it's about a quarter of what we have

00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:22,260
to do in order to be viable and that is

00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:25,290
a hugely I mean that's just that's a

00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:27,180
that's a crazy difference and you might

00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:29,700
even want to consider you know starting

00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:31,470
off your first person might actually as

00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:33,750
soon as you've got it built your first

00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:41,490
person might want to be doing almost all

00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:46,740
marketing so again putting it all

00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:50,130
together making sure you have your goals

00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:52,440
set out be clear about those understand

00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:53,790
what you're you know what is it that's

00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:55,680
motivating why are you willing to take

00:30:53,790 --> 00:30:58,620
this on because when you know when the

00:30:55,680 --> 00:31:00,420
path gets dark and scary and it's not

00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:02,360
fun anymore you're going to need to come

00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:06,240
back and check is this still worth it

00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:10,370
and make sure you've got that success

00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:14,940
criteria set out have those methods

00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:16,610
decided upon make it really small much

00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:20,490
smaller than you then you imagine and

00:31:16,610 --> 00:31:24,300
and then just focus on marketing you get

00:31:20,490 --> 00:31:27,180
the word out and that is the way to make

00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:28,860
it through and actually have the the

00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:30,120
sustainability for people to keep

00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:32,250
cutting you know people using your

00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:33,630
product will make it more sustainable so

00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:34,800
you can keep building it but if you

00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:36,570
don't have that marketing piece in there

00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:39,480
if that's not already something of

00:31:36,570 --> 00:31:44,040
thinking a lot about that's a big blind

00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:45,150
spot I did that way faster than I did I

00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:47,430
don't know what must have like sped up

00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:49,020
my speaking by a fair amount that is

00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:50,610
actually what I wanted to cover today i

00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:53,220
knew i would have time for questions and

00:31:50,610 --> 00:31:55,020
answers there are a number of us i'm

00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:57,150
actually going to call you out again I

00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:58,650
see how many of you have a product that

00:31:57,150 --> 00:32:00,720
you have produced that is out in the

00:31:58,650 --> 00:32:04,200
market that someone could go use today

00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:06,030
has a logo etc awesome home that's

00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:08,310
fantastic alright so I hope you look

00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:10,170
around I am happy to answer questions I

00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:12,950
might ask for you know insights from the

00:32:10,170 --> 00:32:18,000
room as well so I'm going to call that

00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:21,630
done oh and thank you great great talk

00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:23,550
yeah thank you could Joe and so one

00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:27,000
thing it's not so much a question it's

00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:29,190
more kind of a reframing one thing that

00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:32,600
I've been thinking a lot more about

00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:36,210
lately is that there's something called

00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:38,640
productized services and if you want to

00:32:36,210 --> 00:32:41,400
productize and you want to get well

00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:43,020
ultimately if you do it for the money if

00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:45,240
you build a product for the money it's

00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:47,430
all about getting more leverage on your

00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:48,630
time so like making more money for the

00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:51,000
same amount of time that you spend

00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:53,010
that's the end goal cool but there's a

00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,720
shortcut for that like you don't have to

00:32:53,010 --> 00:32:59,059
go to the Batcave and start building

00:32:54,720 --> 00:33:01,309
products and as engineers this is a very

00:32:59,059 --> 00:33:05,480
very difficult thing to do or like we

00:33:01,309 --> 00:33:07,340
just start building but maybe what you

00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:09,259
really should be doing is defining a

00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:12,019
process like figuring out what what are

00:33:09,259 --> 00:33:15,049
your ideal customers like what has been

00:33:12,019 --> 00:33:19,909
working really well and then process if

00:33:15,049 --> 00:33:21,950
I that service and figuring out like how

00:33:19,909 --> 00:33:23,059
what is going to be your process that

00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:25,159
you're going to be doing over and over

00:33:23,059 --> 00:33:26,929
and over again and that way increase

00:33:25,159 --> 00:33:30,379
your margin yeah now you can you can

00:33:26,929 --> 00:33:35,269
charge a fixed fee which is much higher

00:33:30,379 --> 00:33:38,149
than your hourly rate and specialized be

00:33:35,269 --> 00:33:39,860
more referral get people to know you for

00:33:38,149 --> 00:33:41,659
that service and actually make more

00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:45,950
money that way and that's this is a

00:33:41,659 --> 00:33:47,809
really hard lesson that that's that I

00:33:45,950 --> 00:33:50,899
think is important to know about yeah

00:33:47,809 --> 00:33:53,509
absolutely yeah turns out we know how to

00:33:50,899 --> 00:33:55,700
do one thing really really well getting

00:33:53,509 --> 00:34:00,860
better at that is is an incremental step

00:33:55,700 --> 00:34:02,690
that that that's a lot closer to achieve

00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:05,360
abul than it is building a whole product

00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:06,679
it's a fun journey you know like yay us

00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:09,079
for doing it you know like everybody

00:34:06,679 --> 00:34:11,919
here is doing it it is fun it it's i'm

00:34:09,079 --> 00:34:16,000
very happy i sat down on the path but

00:34:11,919 --> 00:34:16,000
it's also got hard spots

00:34:19,919 --> 00:34:25,600
but yeah so the question is how do you

00:34:23,169 --> 00:34:30,400
see open source in the community what

00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:34,150
are the pros and cons so obviously so

00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:35,410
and actually I think I can speak for a

00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:37,060
number of people who answered similar

00:34:35,410 --> 00:34:40,390
kinds of questions as I was preparing

00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:41,770
for this the wonderful thing about open

00:34:40,390 --> 00:34:44,050
sources allows you to iterate and

00:34:41,770 --> 00:34:47,140
prototype really rapidly on a pretty

00:34:44,050 --> 00:34:50,040
robust framework and you know Drupal in

00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:53,230
particular is a great tool to build with

00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:57,850
the the problem is intellectual property

00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:59,890
so someone like if you for example our

00:34:57,850 --> 00:35:02,080
phase 2 and you have open published and

00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:04,660
you have this distribution you also have

00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:06,520
what Greece called I think famously the

00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:08,890
most expensive lead generation tool ever

00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:12,010
invented it took a lot of time and money

00:35:08,890 --> 00:35:13,840
for them to produce that and there is

00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:15,940
zero chance for them I mean they could

00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:19,390
charge some money for it but it's open

00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:21,430
source it is you know completely open

00:35:19,390 --> 00:35:24,340
intellectual property and so they

00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:26,340
couldn't really you know it it would be

00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:29,410
highly unlikely that anyone would buy it

00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:31,030
more than say five times and without

00:35:29,410 --> 00:35:33,640
angering enough people so it just

00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:37,570
doesn't make a lot of sense the places

00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:40,300
where where people have been successful

00:35:37,570 --> 00:35:42,040
I think is when they have something

00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:43,660
there's like a recurring fee for

00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:46,390
something so for example Drupal eyes me

00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:48,310
or note squirrel or pantheon for that

00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:50,080
matter we all kind of are used to the

00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:53,110
world is sort of used to paying for

00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:54,310
those kinds of services so pent hosting

00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:56,200
we sort of get that their servers

00:35:54,310 --> 00:35:58,060
running somewhere so anything you can do

00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:59,200
that sort of ties in or Drupal eyes me

00:35:58,060 --> 00:36:02,410
you sort of get that you're tying into

00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:03,640
this like library of learning anything

00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:06,310
you can do this sort of ties into

00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:08,710
something that the mindset is already

00:36:06,310 --> 00:36:10,240
there for 4 i'm willing to pay for this

00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:15,040
i understand that there's something here

00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:16,210
is is way more viable and that's that

00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:17,890
can be a tricky you mean like the Venn

00:36:16,210 --> 00:36:19,720
diagram of that and open source is not a

00:36:17,890 --> 00:36:25,070
huge overlap but there are definitely

00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:28,220
places there sorry

00:36:25,070 --> 00:36:30,890
open SAS yeah absolutely do you have an

00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:34,550
example in mind or are you thinking of

00:36:30,890 --> 00:36:36,520
something particular but ok alright well

00:36:34,550 --> 00:36:43,580
we'll wait all right awesome good luck

00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:45,740
yes great obsession um I suppose most of

00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:50,330
us sell services like you said so we're

00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:52,190
more used to doing marketing through

00:36:50,330 --> 00:36:55,520
thought leadership blogging and coming

00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:57,920
to conferences so we're pretty good at

00:36:55,520 --> 00:37:01,640
that I think um we want to be good at

00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:03,470
them in terms of a product do you think

00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:05,750
there's like a formula that we can use

00:37:03,470 --> 00:37:07,340
to create marketing without putting

00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:09,980
money into this I mean you talked about

00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:12,020
Edwards so you know you create your

00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:13,970
landing page like you said you put your

00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:15,590
call to action you make people register

00:37:13,970 --> 00:37:19,280
they're going to curse at you because

00:37:15,590 --> 00:37:21,320
the products not ready yes but then you

00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:23,530
have to take people to your site how do

00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:26,030
you do that how do you do that for b2b

00:37:23,530 --> 00:37:27,800
do you guys have any experience I mean

00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:29,630
you can share from pantheon oh yeah

00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:31,070
absolutely so i'll give an answer i

00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:35,960
think Christoph's gotta like an answer

00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:37,100
he wants to give to so so for that to do

00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:39,310
it like one of the things you said that

00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:42,760
jumped out at me was to do it for free

00:37:39,310 --> 00:37:45,020
no I mean I don't think if we you know

00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:46,940
if I had a magic wand that'd be great

00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:50,690
but I I know of no way to do that for

00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:52,160
free that doesn't involve do you all

00:37:50,690 --> 00:37:54,350
right excellent I mean that that doesn't

00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:57,680
correspondingly involve a huge trade off

00:37:54,350 --> 00:37:59,300
of time right there's there's no it's

00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:02,210
one or the other and you're paying with

00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:05,210
something not enough that I can expound

00:38:02,210 --> 00:38:07,220
but so what we did with Walker so walk

00:38:05,210 --> 00:38:09,260
hope is basically an alternative

00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:11,680
alternative for walk knee which is a

00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:14,390
really expensive Enterprise Service and

00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:17,300
some rebuilt we made a web we made a

00:38:14,390 --> 00:38:21,380
blog post titled free and open-source

00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:23,210
alternatives for walk me and we did a

00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:26,420
review of a bunch of other tools and

00:38:23,210 --> 00:38:28,670
then there was also walk up and we are

00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:29,780
until today without doing any effort at

00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:32,510
all at all

00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:35,540
get weekly 23 signups for walk me

00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:40,160
because for woke up because of that so

00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:42,200
you can just do marketing jiu-jitsu with

00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:44,270
your open source tool this is if you do

00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:46,040
an open source tool or if you do a

00:38:44,270 --> 00:38:48,590
cheaper tool although that I wouldn't go

00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:51,290
for cheaper version of something don't

00:38:48,590 --> 00:38:52,640
do that it's a bad idea but if you go to

00:38:51,290 --> 00:38:54,560
open source through it and have another

00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:56,660
this is Smallville around that then you

00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:58,520
can you can you can do it that way with

00:38:56,660 --> 00:39:01,090
very very little effort and very little

00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:03,830
money and just get a steady stream of

00:39:01,090 --> 00:39:05,930
leads come yeah actually all right so

00:39:03,830 --> 00:39:09,980
that that is X right thank you that was

00:39:05,930 --> 00:39:15,350
a good a better answer in some ways the

00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:17,090
so using a really smart analysis of your

00:39:15,350 --> 00:39:19,100
market and then figuring out what

00:39:17,090 --> 00:39:20,690
content you can produce is something you

00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:22,070
definitely should be doing that is a

00:39:20,690 --> 00:39:23,750
great stat that like one article

00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:27,490
producing two three signups a week

00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:27,490
that's excellent other questions

00:39:34,789 --> 00:39:39,089
yeah so the question is would note

00:39:37,349 --> 00:39:41,549
scroll have been a successful product if

00:39:39,089 --> 00:39:49,380
we sort of quit set everything aside and

00:39:41,549 --> 00:39:51,839
just focused on that yeah so one of the

00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:53,640
things as I did the timeline so we

00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:58,170
started working on node school in 2011

00:39:53,640 --> 00:40:00,989
and here you know in 2015 pantheon

00:39:58,170 --> 00:40:03,749
purchased it and it had grown like all

00:40:00,989 --> 00:40:06,719
of the numbers were nice but it hadn't

00:40:03,749 --> 00:40:11,279
you know like it would still below a

00:40:06,719 --> 00:40:13,859
single full-time person's salary so if

00:40:11,279 --> 00:40:17,279
we had just said right we're going to

00:40:13,859 --> 00:40:18,539
set aside $300,000 we're going to turn

00:40:17,279 --> 00:40:20,279
off everything else I'm going to focus

00:40:18,539 --> 00:40:24,509
down on this world or done we would

00:40:20,279 --> 00:40:25,589
gotten a lot faster I don't know if it

00:40:24,509 --> 00:40:30,289
would have been a success though because

00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:34,699
I the the long time horizon actually

00:40:30,289 --> 00:40:38,189
probably helped us survive more mistakes

00:40:34,699 --> 00:40:39,929
right so we were slow and learning

00:40:38,189 --> 00:40:43,160
slowly I don't know if we would have

00:40:39,929 --> 00:40:45,719
learned as fast probably we would have I

00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:48,709
don't know that's a hard I don't know I

00:40:45,719 --> 00:40:51,900
honestly don't know I'd like to think so

00:40:48,709 --> 00:40:54,029
well it's a risky one though right

00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:55,709
burning this you know again you know how

00:40:54,029 --> 00:40:56,849
to you know how to do something pretty

00:40:55,709 --> 00:41:00,269
well to be able to make it to these

00:40:56,849 --> 00:41:04,039
chairs it's always there and go back to

00:41:00,269 --> 00:41:04,039
it but it's a pretty bold move

00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:10,390
yep

00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:33,850
actually I knowing you yeah this is

00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:39,460
gonna be good advice can you take the

00:41:33,850 --> 00:41:40,930
mic please no no come on what's the

00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:46,150
product as well can you all reminds like

00:41:40,930 --> 00:41:47,920
traveling in Italy is like the almost oh

00:41:46,150 --> 00:41:48,970
this is bad like I'm one of the people

00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:55,660
who said I thought it was great and

00:41:48,970 --> 00:42:02,020
didn't buy it sorry about that all right

00:41:55,660 --> 00:42:05,470
all right a little musical interlude so

00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:08,380
we're room if I and we do booking

00:42:05,470 --> 00:42:10,540
solutions for so the travel connection

00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:15,600
is for vacation rentals hotels and so on

00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:19,660
so we left the agency side of things and

00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:24,100
there it was this six months we left six

00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:27,160
months ago and launched SAS service two

00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:33,220
weeks ago or yeah almost two weeks ago

00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:34,960
congratulations I hope but we were kind

00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:37,780
of doing the range of things so you have

00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:39,490
a SAS service which is thirty dollars a

00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:41,770
month and you get your vacation rental

00:42:39,490 --> 00:42:43,990
website and then on the other side of

00:42:41,770 --> 00:42:45,790
things we have what crystal was talking

00:42:43,990 --> 00:42:49,590
about which is kind of a product eyes

00:42:45,790 --> 00:42:51,970
service in that as you are getting

00:42:49,590 --> 00:42:54,070
talking to bigger companies that need

00:42:51,970 --> 00:42:56,260
customizations you have a base product

00:42:54,070 --> 00:42:59,020
which is a distro and you customize it

00:42:56,260 --> 00:43:01,650
for them now that the choice that we

00:42:59,020 --> 00:43:04,900
made was to make all of these open cells

00:43:01,650 --> 00:43:07,000
so it's all on github somewhere that

00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:09,730
people can download customers don't

00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,990
actually our customers like the people

00:43:09,730 --> 00:43:13,090
that actually want to give us money

00:43:10,990 --> 00:43:15,460
don't care about that because they don't

00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:17,860
know Drupal at all they don't know open

00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:22,960
source at all so it's like can you give

00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:24,970
me what I need and that was a really

00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:27,190
good lesson and the other one was it's

00:43:24,970 --> 00:43:27,780
good to go for Minimum Viable Product

00:43:27,190 --> 00:43:30,750
absolute

00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:34,790
me but be very careful about the viable

00:43:30,750 --> 00:43:37,890
part of things it's like customers will

00:43:34,790 --> 00:43:39,510
take the competitors page and just go

00:43:37,890 --> 00:43:42,270
through it and say so do you have this

00:43:39,510 --> 00:43:45,180
do you have this do you have this and if

00:43:42,270 --> 00:43:46,500
you don't you need a good answer to you

00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:49,500
know how are they going to solve that

00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:52,230
problem so it's it's minimum yes but it

00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:55,770
has to be viable and that is just as

00:43:52,230 --> 00:43:58,350
important and that's pretty much where

00:43:55,770 --> 00:44:00,120
we are right now awesome awesome so six

00:43:58,350 --> 00:44:01,950
months so I'm curious so like if you

00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:05,180
were answering the question about like

00:44:01,950 --> 00:44:08,670
is it okay to to ditch the agency life

00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:15,270
focus it down on it how are you feeling

00:44:08,670 --> 00:44:17,970
how would you answer that so I think my

00:44:15,270 --> 00:44:19,620
view right now is that it can be i agree

00:44:17,970 --> 00:44:22,800
with you it can be done within an agency

00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:25,680
but it's really really hard and it's

00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:29,430
probably easier because you're going to

00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:31,620
fail faster if you ditch the agency life

00:44:29,430 --> 00:44:34,110
and just did yourself and if you're

00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:36,420
going to do it within an agency create a

00:44:34,110 --> 00:44:38,970
separate comes with a separate team and

00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:40,440
all of that that's what we got draw my

00:44:38,970 --> 00:44:43,590
thing and we were kind of messing around

00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:46,080
with rooms for two years or something

00:44:43,590 --> 00:44:48,150
and it was just not getting anywhere we

00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:51,480
had nice things we could show people

00:44:48,150 --> 00:44:53,370
landing pages and so on but now it's an

00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:56,460
actual product and it's only been six

00:44:53,370 --> 00:44:59,610
months and in terms of the marketing

00:44:56,460 --> 00:45:02,400
question our marketing is thought

00:44:59,610 --> 00:45:07,200
leadership I mean look very carefully at

00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:10,080
what the what the domain is any domain

00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:12,180
requires people that think about it

00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:14,070
create content and in our case it's

00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:16,650
vacation rentals and hotels and so on

00:45:14,070 --> 00:45:18,030
and there's a lot to be said about you

00:45:16,650 --> 00:45:19,230
know how they should be building their

00:45:18,030 --> 00:45:22,260
websites and what they should be doing

00:45:19,230 --> 00:45:25,640
and with Drupal we have a huge advantage

00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:28,410
because while our competitors are

00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:31,200
focusing kind of building everything

00:45:28,410 --> 00:45:32,690
themselves like they building a CMS and

00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:34,550
then they're building a book

00:45:32,690 --> 00:45:36,200
engine and then they have to keep up

00:45:34,550 --> 00:45:38,810
with the rest of the web in terms of

00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:40,819
things happening we just do the booking

00:45:38,810 --> 00:45:44,420
engine and we get commerce from Drupal

00:45:40,819 --> 00:45:45,920
commerce and all the latest widgets that

00:45:44,420 --> 00:45:47,660
you could add to your website from all

00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:49,849
the people that immediately create a

00:45:47,660 --> 00:45:52,460
module as soon as some service pop song

00:45:49,849 --> 00:45:55,460
so we have a huge advantage in terms of

00:45:52,460 --> 00:45:58,400
how quickly we can iterate there's lots

00:45:55,460 --> 00:46:01,220
of problems with that as well but it's

00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:10,010
all good awesome congratulations thank

00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:12,319
you it is no questions comment

00:46:10,010 --> 00:46:14,300
essentially one of the points which you

00:46:12,319 --> 00:46:16,339
mentioned what profit has lost in your

00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:18,050
table I think people who are going to

00:46:16,339 --> 00:46:20,690
fund it would put right up in the dub

00:46:18,050 --> 00:46:25,250
right up on the top essentially up the

00:46:20,690 --> 00:46:27,829
table a question related to that is well

00:46:25,250 --> 00:46:30,140
you did mention the hourly rate and now

00:46:27,829 --> 00:46:33,710
the return of that is there a time

00:46:30,140 --> 00:46:37,310
period which we should look at how much

00:46:33,710 --> 00:46:42,760
should we burn before we call it quits

00:46:37,310 --> 00:46:44,210
or being successful yeah so I think I

00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:45,770
unfortunately I don't think there's an

00:46:44,210 --> 00:46:47,960
easy answer but I think the way which

00:46:45,770 --> 00:46:50,210
you answer that oath that was recorded

00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:53,030
right so the way in which you have to

00:46:50,210 --> 00:46:55,640
answer that really goes back to those

00:46:53,030 --> 00:46:58,190
motivators so the more boxes you can

00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:59,450
tick in that is it learning is it fun

00:46:58,190 --> 00:47:01,490
are you solving your internal needs

00:46:59,450 --> 00:47:04,550
thought leadership the more of those

00:47:01,490 --> 00:47:08,660
that this is solving the larger your

00:47:04,550 --> 00:47:11,150
budget can be so if it's just profit for

00:47:08,660 --> 00:47:15,560
example it's almost like a VC model or

00:47:11,150 --> 00:47:17,420
something but it well so again that

00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:18,619
that's something you'll understand the

00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:21,710
market and the size of the opportunity

00:47:18,619 --> 00:47:23,270
for whatever your idea is one other

00:47:21,710 --> 00:47:25,430
thing that actually I just want to

00:47:23,270 --> 00:47:27,260
reiterate that this sooner whether or

00:47:25,430 --> 00:47:30,050
not you quit the agency life or not is

00:47:27,260 --> 00:47:33,829
is a you know open question the sooner

00:47:30,050 --> 00:47:37,010
you can put dedicated people on the the

00:47:33,829 --> 00:47:38,960
idea the that's the spot where a lot of

00:47:37,010 --> 00:47:41,060
successful people have said like that's

00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:42,500
that was it like that was the thing when

00:47:41,060 --> 00:47:44,060
we got somebody who wasn't just being

00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:45,930
squeezed in around the edges you know

00:47:44,060 --> 00:47:48,480
every Tuesday they got to work for two

00:47:45,930 --> 00:47:51,690
or something whatever it was having a

00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:53,220
dedicated person was he a critical path

00:47:51,690 --> 00:47:55,200
to success and treating them and

00:47:53,220 --> 00:47:58,020
respecting that not like you get to do

00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:59,790
this occasionally it's like that is your

00:47:58,020 --> 00:48:01,950
job I saw a couple heads nodding like

00:47:59,790 --> 00:48:05,160
there were other did you have something

00:48:01,950 --> 00:48:07,170
man go ahead okay I have a comment and

00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:09,390
I'm question I'm pedaling it from from

00:48:07,170 --> 00:48:13,260
common Norway we have a couple of

00:48:09,390 --> 00:48:14,609
products so this quick learner mentioned

00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:16,940
that there's there's another way to

00:48:14,609 --> 00:48:19,550
think about products as well and that's

00:48:16,940 --> 00:48:23,609
what we did with our newspaper

00:48:19,550 --> 00:48:26,099
distribution which is now sort of like a

00:48:23,609 --> 00:48:29,329
cloud solution for a decoupled cloud

00:48:26,099 --> 00:48:31,349
solutions and then we have a newspaper

00:48:29,329 --> 00:48:33,780
clients coming to us one in that

00:48:31,349 --> 00:48:36,750
solution it's not self service or

00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:40,109
anything there's no you no place to

00:48:36,750 --> 00:48:42,660
login or pay or anything like that but

00:48:40,109 --> 00:48:45,690
it's like a place you can go you get a

00:48:42,660 --> 00:48:47,490
football newspaper solution and we have

00:48:45,690 --> 00:48:53,220
tons of design elements and things like

00:48:47,490 --> 00:48:56,190
that but then the price is very low they

00:48:53,220 --> 00:48:59,640
play they pay a monthly fee but of

00:48:56,190 --> 00:49:04,650
course they always want more so it's

00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:08,069
like a perfect mix of just off-the-shelf

00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:10,799
stuff and then you then we get all the

00:49:08,069 --> 00:49:13,020
you know the integrations and custom

00:49:10,799 --> 00:49:15,119
designs and new functionality and stuff

00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:17,849
like that and then we ship and we have a

00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:19,410
very special contract so that we new

00:49:17,849 --> 00:49:24,000
features from other clients we share

00:49:19,410 --> 00:49:27,690
with new clients basically so it doesn't

00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:30,869
really mean more work for us it does

00:49:27,690 --> 00:49:32,819
mean that we have to think a bit

00:49:30,869 --> 00:49:35,010
different and plan better or when we

00:49:32,819 --> 00:49:36,270
start working with you clients or

00:49:35,010 --> 00:49:39,359
something but now we have like 10

00:49:36,270 --> 00:49:42,420
newspapers built off the same actually

00:49:39,359 --> 00:49:45,450
it's the same github repository cool

00:49:42,420 --> 00:49:48,750
just go oh but also have a question in

00:49:45,450 --> 00:49:51,059
that guard we have some stuff around

00:49:48,750 --> 00:49:53,910
that distribution that we would like to

00:49:51,059 --> 00:49:54,680
open source but at the same time some of

00:49:53,910 --> 00:49:57,680
them

00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:59,810
we've invested heavily in them so we've

00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:02,450
experimented with the idea maybe we

00:49:59,810 --> 00:50:06,830
could you know monetize these things

00:50:02,450 --> 00:50:09,800
somehow but I haven't really seen many

00:50:06,830 --> 00:50:16,010
successes and trying to monetize

00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:17,690
products in the Drupal yeah community in

00:50:16,010 --> 00:50:21,110
a sense except for the hosting stuff

00:50:17,690 --> 00:50:23,000
yeah I think that yeah I do think that's

00:50:21,110 --> 00:50:25,400
going to be very hard unfortunately

00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:28,220
paying a subscription fee is something

00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:30,680
that I think again like that's an

00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:33,320
understood sort of mental model for you

00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:35,570
know the world people are willing to pay

00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:39,680
you know like 10 newspapers that's

00:50:35,570 --> 00:50:41,810
that's a great model I would go back to

00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:43,940
goals like how much do you realistically

00:50:41,810 --> 00:50:45,650
think you could you know if you were

00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:48,260
what I'm what I'm intuiting is like you

00:50:45,650 --> 00:50:50,120
made some modules for example that do

00:50:48,260 --> 00:50:51,800
some functionality like you'd like to

00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:53,540
have that be out there but you'd also

00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:57,190
like to charge for it is that kind of

00:50:53,540 --> 00:51:00,410
true yes I understand that right yeah so

00:50:57,190 --> 00:51:03,170
well GPL will you know you're gonna have

00:51:00,410 --> 00:51:06,320
intellectual property concerns there and

00:51:03,170 --> 00:51:07,760
I would season freely work that way

00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:10,970
though because they would be integrated

00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:13,580
the like rest api basically okay oh

00:51:10,970 --> 00:51:14,600
interesting all right well you might

00:51:13,580 --> 00:51:16,070
have something there again like you

00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:17,750
charge a subscription for something like

00:51:16,070 --> 00:51:19,880
that and open it up so that others can

00:51:17,750 --> 00:51:23,840
use it and such yeah something like a

00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:26,420
subscription for functionality is doable

00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:28,520
something like charging straight for the

00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:31,580
modules functionality the closer you are

00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:32,840
to that the the less likely it is the

00:51:31,580 --> 00:51:34,970
more likely i think that you'll anger

00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:38,240
people just you know you know make

00:51:34,970 --> 00:51:39,710
people unhappy and you know frankly not

00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:42,620
make as much as if you'd had some other

00:51:39,710 --> 00:51:45,470
solution and to be honest i don't think

00:51:42,620 --> 00:51:48,080
it would work but it would be awesome to

00:51:45,470 --> 00:51:52,520
hear you know mm-hmm if someone had

00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:55,760
succeeded in monetizing of you know kind

00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:56,830
of what they do in maybe not always such

00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:58,940
a good way in the WordPress community

00:51:56,830 --> 00:52:02,410
yeah right right right do you have a

00:51:58,940 --> 00:52:02,410
comment yet did answer

00:52:44,470 --> 00:52:50,840
interesting awesome cool thank you hi

00:52:47,750 --> 00:52:54,650
taco from go gorilla we're talking about

00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:56,330
WordPress plugins that are paid so what

00:52:54,650 --> 00:52:58,280
we did is we took the most popular

00:52:56,330 --> 00:53:02,480
WordPress module which is the Yoast SEO

00:52:58,280 --> 00:53:05,510
module 22 million installs and we're

00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:07,490
launching it tomorrow for Drupal so I

00:53:05,510 --> 00:53:10,220
think we'll see some more discussion

00:53:07,490 --> 00:53:12,680
about it will be a free module with all

00:53:10,220 --> 00:53:14,510
the features and then we will launch

00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:18,890
premium module which gives you gives you

00:53:14,510 --> 00:53:21,470
24 7 boards and so we really like to

00:53:18,890 --> 00:53:24,650
have a discussion about this because we

00:53:21,470 --> 00:53:27,500
feel that we invested 20k in this

00:53:24,650 --> 00:53:29,810
project we can only do this like make a

00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:31,670
really good SEO module helping Drupal

00:53:29,810 --> 00:53:34,040
helping all everybody here and all your

00:53:31,670 --> 00:53:36,200
clients if we also get some money back

00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:39,050
from this so so what I fear sometimes

00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:41,330
for for open sources that we don't have

00:53:39,050 --> 00:53:43,280
enough money to really do innovations or

00:53:41,330 --> 00:53:44,660
really build cool products so I'd really

00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:47,000
love to have a discussion about a

00:53:44,660 --> 00:53:50,120
premium module which is not limiting you

00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:52,040
in your features but it will give you

00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:54,410
support so you know if there's a bug or

00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:57,050
something you just can call Yost or us

00:53:54,410 --> 00:53:58,550
and we'll fix it for you so we would

00:53:57,050 --> 00:54:02,450
like to really experiment with bait

00:53:58,550 --> 00:54:04,910
modules in order to build better stuff

00:54:02,450 --> 00:54:05,960
for Drupal in the end and we're Google

00:54:04,910 --> 00:54:08,330
real life you have any feedback or

00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:10,460
discussions about this yeah we'd love to

00:54:08,330 --> 00:54:14,600
share these because yeah thanks for

00:54:10,460 --> 00:54:15,950
saying I think so yeah there's been a

00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:18,890
lot of conversations in that space

00:54:15,950 --> 00:54:20,870
obviously and that's a tricky one I

00:54:18,890 --> 00:54:22,460
think to the extent that you are having

00:54:20,870 --> 00:54:23,810
people pay for support that's again

00:54:22,460 --> 00:54:27,980
something that you people are used to

00:54:23,810 --> 00:54:29,630
that's a common model calling it a

00:54:27,980 --> 00:54:33,320
premium module would start I mean I

00:54:29,630 --> 00:54:35,570
think it gets a little bit to the

00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:38,090
slippery slope of oh i don't know like

00:54:35,570 --> 00:54:40,670
it's a service that you make available

00:54:38,090 --> 00:54:42,170
to people who subscribe or something

00:54:40,670 --> 00:54:46,340
like that but yeah that's a good thing

00:54:42,170 --> 00:54:50,240
yeah all right thanks yep any other

00:54:46,340 --> 00:54:52,930
questions all right well thank you all

00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:52,930
Oh nope

00:55:05,390 --> 00:55:08,290
