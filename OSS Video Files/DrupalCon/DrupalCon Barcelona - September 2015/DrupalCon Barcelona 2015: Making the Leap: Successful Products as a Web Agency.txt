Title: DrupalCon Barcelona 2015: Making the Leap: Successful Products as a Web Agency
Publication date: 2015-09-22
Playlist: DrupalCon Barcelona - September 2015
Description: 
	Web agencies often think about building successful products. Making money while you sleep is an exciting prospect for web agencies used to selling hours. 

Making the leap from a successful web agency to a successful product organization is a big one. Common wisdom says that you shouldn’t even think about combining the two. Nevertheless, many of us still try and there are successful examples in our space. 

If you are interested in exploring products as a web firm, this session is a primer on how to do so successfully, including topics like how to balance client work, prioritize development, staff correctly and start earning your first recurring revenue. 

Drew has run a successful web agency, (Gorton Studios), built a successful product (NodeSquirrel) and now works at a highly successful product / PAAS company (Pantheon). Doing all three has given him a unique understanding of the different problems and opportunities involved in each and ideas on how best to approach their different needs.

all right good afternoon everyone I

00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:07,319
think we'll go ahead and get started

00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:08,910
here so if you haven't already intuited

00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:11,309
this we're talking today about making

00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:15,389
the leap doing successful products as a

00:00:11,309 --> 00:00:18,330
web agency and we'll be talking about a

00:00:15,389 --> 00:00:20,010
few things specifically and it's so for

00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:22,410
warning if this is not what you were

00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:24,449
hoping to have be covered then I will

00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:25,619
not be offended if you leave so we're

00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:27,269
going to be talking about things like

00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:30,000
your motivators and your goals and

00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:31,320
building products wouldn't MVP is in the

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,290
role of marketing and things like that

00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:36,030
we are not going to be talking about how

00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:38,070
to build a product was kind of technical

00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:40,140
frameworks sort of design considerations

00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:42,719
a be testing any of those sort of

00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:44,969
specific techniques on how to build a

00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,320
product so this is a lot more about how

00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:48,960
to think about a product how to plan for

00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,070
a product and how to be able to deliver

00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:55,620
one successfully from a business

00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:56,789
perspective so I think furthermore like

00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:59,699
the people who are going to get the most

00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:01,739
out of this talk are this describes us

00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:03,840
so I'm curious actually just show of

00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:08,549
hands how many of us make things for

00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:11,790
clients yay okay excellent and have an

00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:14,820
idea or a prototype good cool all right

00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:18,780
guys and then we're wondering what to do

00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:21,299
now really oh right all right um good

00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:22,979
okay so i hope this this I think well

00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:25,350
we'll see we've got the right on it's in

00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:29,100
the room so a little bit about myself my

00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:31,829
name is drew gordon and i have a an

00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:33,810
interesting perspective in this so i ran

00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:37,140
a web services forum called gorton

00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:39,630
studios for about 15 years and we did

00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:42,299
full service design development training

00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:44,549
content strategy etc etc for an array of

00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:46,530
clients so it's this small team of

00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:49,860
Vienna programmers and UX people and

00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:51,509
such coming into a client and saying

00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:54,960
what you need and helping plan that and

00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:57,090
build that in and deliver it as that

00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:59,579
agency we also built something called

00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:02,399
node squirrel a node squirrel is a

00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:03,390
backup service that plugs into Drupal so

00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,119
it makes it easy to have off-site

00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:09,149
backups so we were an agency that did

00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:10,560
that and then since then in 2015

00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:14,120
actually just before Drupal con los

00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:17,160
angeles pantheon bought node score

00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:19,710
and the twist in that plot for me was

00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:22,260
when they said drew you should go with

00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:24,120
and join pantheon and I was kind of

00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:26,070
surprised at that and but anyways long

00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,510
story short I did not so I've got this

00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:28,680
breadth of experience I understand what

00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:31,860
it's like to build things for clients

00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:34,650
and I was a team of seven and now i'm up

00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:37,110
to a team of 80 at a products company so

00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:39,210
it's very different worldviews and I'm

00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:40,800
hoping that I can synthesize as much as

00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:43,020
that as possible so that you two can go

00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:49,980
off and be successful and make your own

00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:52,110
leap the conventional wisdom of doing a

00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:53,610
product as a services company how many

00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:57,990
people have heard something like this

00:02:53,610 --> 00:03:00,420
don't do it right oh come on more of us

00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:02,820
have heard that right this is definitely

00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:05,280
i don't know i heard this a lot yet all

00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:09,930
of us are still doing it so good good

00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:14,040
for us that you can do it it's very

00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:16,020
doable unfortunately it's hard and so

00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:18,000
hopefully again what we're talking about

00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:19,950
today will will help you be able to you

00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,270
know have your hands raised and and give

00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:25,020
this session next time at your local

00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:28,050
camp or the next drupalcon there are

00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:29,670
successful examples in our space and in

00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:30,720
preparing for this talk you know those

00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:32,580
of us have been doing this kind of thing

00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,320
we often have conversations but we'll be

00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:36,240
looking at some of these very specific

00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:38,280
examples and advice from folks who have

00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:41,070
done this successfully and so in the

00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:42,510
case of Pantheon for example was founded

00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:43,860
by some of the founders of both for

00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:45,660
kitchens in chapter three who are web

00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:47,610
agencies doing the same thing as like

00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:49,590
gorton studios lullaby is just a

00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:51,120
fantastic agency that's been around for

00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:54,390
a very long time they made something

00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,260
called Drupal eyes me and that's a based

00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:58,110
off of the sort of like training

00:03:55,260 --> 00:04:00,330
expertise that they built so it's a it's

00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:04,770
a great service and we actually have

00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:07,080
addy hi hi addy and we'll see some of

00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:08,340
her advice he recession gorton studios

00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:11,100
obviously made notes girl I've already

00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:13,260
talked about that callum una may is an

00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:15,420
agency based in the San Francisco Bay

00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:17,549
Area and they make something called cala

00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:19,739
box which is a local development

00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:22,080
environment that is more modern than

00:04:19,739 --> 00:04:24,830
same amp so if you have local

00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:26,900
development environment sort of needs

00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:28,340
and are wondering how to solve those you

00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:30,830
should take a look at cala box it's like

00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:32,500
pop it in and it's got you know best

00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:34,430
practices container based architecture

00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:36,680
optimized you know things like varnish

00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:39,919
and and a whole tool stack there for

00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:43,819
doing really good development phase two

00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:45,949
is another agency about 150 people

00:04:43,819 --> 00:04:48,139
they're based in the US but they have

00:04:45,949 --> 00:04:49,610
people all around the world and they

00:04:48,139 --> 00:04:51,520
maintain a number of distributions

00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:56,919
including one that's called open publish

00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:58,879
which is for publishers basically as a

00:04:56,919 --> 00:05:02,000
starting it's a distribution dribble

00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:04,370
distribution for intended to be used by

00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,770
publishers and media people and then

00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:08,300
probiotics and we have christoph i think

00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:10,310
somewhere in the room as well the

00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:11,629
another small firm that has gone off and

00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:13,639
made something called walk up which is

00:05:11,629 --> 00:05:15,409
for documenting websites and having you

00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:17,719
know guided tours and the ability sort

00:05:15,409 --> 00:05:20,900
of click through and have a self

00:05:17,719 --> 00:05:22,550
documenting interface um so we're going

00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:25,129
to see you know lessons from all of

00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:26,779
these folks and hopefully again

00:05:25,129 --> 00:05:28,189
synthesizing a lot of the conversations

00:05:26,779 --> 00:05:32,060
that many of us have had over the years

00:05:28,189 --> 00:05:34,039
about these things and and another

00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:36,620
resource so we'll have all of those

00:05:34,039 --> 00:05:38,150
people helping guide this things but one

00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:43,039
of the things i also want to point out

00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:44,810
is a lot of these ideas are from a kind

00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:46,879
of startup called lean startups also

00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:50,719
like this the the notion if you're not

00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:52,819
familiar with the idea of a lean startup

00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:55,460
and you're sitting here you should be so

00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:57,740
i would really recommend this site lean

00:05:55,460 --> 00:06:01,460
stack calm in particular has lots of

00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:03,440
great articles this book recommendation

00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:05,690
actually came to me via Ryan Strama who

00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:08,300
gave a talk in some ways it's similar to

00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:10,190
this at drupa con Latin America so again

00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:11,120
that this topic interests you I would

00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:14,810
encourage you to check out these

00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:17,629
resources as well again I'm going to try

00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:18,860
and take all of that and present in a

00:06:17,629 --> 00:06:20,349
way that I think makes sense for all of

00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:24,529
us with a sort of shared background of

00:06:20,349 --> 00:06:25,639
building things for clients and and

00:06:24,529 --> 00:06:29,240
these are the things I want to talk

00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:32,089
about so before you start a product you

00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:35,740
need to define some things and all of us

00:06:32,089 --> 00:06:35,740
who didn't do some of these things

00:06:36,449 --> 00:06:43,259
wished we had so specifically if you

00:06:41,129 --> 00:06:46,319
don't know what your goals are for the

00:06:43,259 --> 00:06:47,819
product it's going to be really hard to

00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:50,009
figure out if you're doing the right

00:06:47,819 --> 00:06:51,990
thing and being very explicit about

00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:54,240
those goals and likewise once you've got

00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:56,400
those goals from there saying what is

00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:59,669
success going to be what will we call

00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:02,189
success if you're and we'll dive into

00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:03,779
each of these things how are you going

00:07:02,189 --> 00:07:05,719
to fund it how are you going to resource

00:07:03,779 --> 00:07:09,539
it what are these methods going to be

00:07:05,719 --> 00:07:12,300
MVP the Minimum Viable Product what's

00:07:09,539 --> 00:07:14,490
the smallest version of that thing that

00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:15,779
you can build this one I think for all

00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:17,819
of us I mean all of these are

00:07:15,779 --> 00:07:21,810
challenging but as people who build

00:07:17,819 --> 00:07:25,589
things for others understanding the MVP

00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:29,279
and and actually getting to minimum

00:07:25,589 --> 00:07:30,870
viable product is very hard I think we

00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:33,300
have a tendency as people who make

00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:34,740
things when we in the vacuum what we're

00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:37,620
going to do is make more things and

00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:41,009
that's actually not really good for a

00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:42,360
product and then another thing that I

00:07:41,009 --> 00:07:46,349
think is a blank spot for many of us is

00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:47,550
marketing we understand maybe so you

00:07:46,349 --> 00:07:50,819
know like maybe that we understand that

00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:53,490
word but the the critical importance of

00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:56,399
marketing in a product is you you just

00:07:53,490 --> 00:08:00,270
cannot underestimate how important that

00:07:56,399 --> 00:08:01,860
is for your long-term success so let's

00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:07,169
dive into goal so I think there's a

00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:10,199
number of motivators for why we attempt

00:08:07,169 --> 00:08:13,199
products and if you understand your

00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:14,849
motivators it will help you know how to

00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:16,439
make decisions so this is pretty basic

00:08:14,849 --> 00:08:19,199
but I think it's the right place to

00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:21,749
start no your goals and I think there's

00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:24,300
really six goals as I you know I've

00:08:21,749 --> 00:08:26,909
talked with others of that that

00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:27,990
influence is so fun obviously fun is you

00:08:26,909 --> 00:08:29,610
know like if you're just doing this as

00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:31,229
yourself you just knew nights and

00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:33,750
weekends you're having fun doing it

00:08:31,229 --> 00:08:35,819
that's great organizationally you might

00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:37,319
call fun something like we have been

00:08:35,819 --> 00:08:39,269
working on this long project and it's

00:08:37,319 --> 00:08:41,010
been a bit of a slog and the team is not

00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:43,019
very motivated we're going to give them

00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:45,899
something enjoyable to do the product

00:08:43,019 --> 00:08:48,500
can help fill that space learning is

00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:50,150
again its own reward we are

00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:51,530
neurology we like to learn we probably

00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:53,270
you know by virtually probably

00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:55,250
self-selected this industry because we

00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:57,320
enjoy learning but also if we don't

00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:59,780
continue learning new things we quickly

00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:02,660
go stale and that is a very big problem

00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:04,400
for our professional careers sometimes

00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:07,400
products are response to an internal

00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:09,470
need so we wanted to build this thing

00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:10,600
because we were really tired of all the

00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:14,000
time and effort we are spending

00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:15,800
recreating it every time that's an

00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,180
example ii Cala box started like that

00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:19,250
and essentially Pantheon did as well

00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:22,420
which came out of a number of projects

00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:27,530
that were you know big early Drupal

00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:30,190
major sites lead generation is all about

00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:33,620
putting something out into the world and

00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:35,530
saying it's by us and then people seeing

00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:37,460
it and saying like oh I like this thing

00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:40,330
I'm going to contact those people

00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:42,760
because I want something similar so

00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:45,530
getting out there is it's a sales tool

00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:47,720
and closely related that to that is

00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:50,330
something you know thought leadership so

00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:53,000
thought leadership being demonstrating

00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:54,800
that you are the people who deeply

00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,270
understand drupal and something else for

00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:59,660
example or whatever it is the whatever

00:09:56,270 --> 00:10:01,280
your idea or prototype it is underst you

00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:02,420
are you're you're putting your stamp on

00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:05,570
that saying we're the people who

00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:08,089
understand drupal magento integration or

00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:09,650
something like that that's thought

00:10:08,089 --> 00:10:11,690
leadership anybody wants to have like

00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:15,020
the best drupal magento integration

00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:17,240
they're going to find you and and the

00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:19,280
last one is profit not all products will

00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:22,040
seek profit but those that do have some

00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:25,280
important considerations they all have

00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:28,160
downsides however so we kind of talked

00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:32,600
about the nice things the cons here like

00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:34,670
fun if you're only so essentially if you

00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:37,160
are only doing a product for one or two

00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:39,350
of these reasons I would say that you

00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:41,390
are in danger right if you can have a

00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:44,990
product that it you know tix like four

00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:46,490
of these that's fantastic five and six I

00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:48,350
don't even that would be mind-blowing if

00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:50,990
you could get all six of these into your

00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:52,280
idea you should definitely do it so I

00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:54,110
would say that you know the more of

00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:56,180
these that you have the better because

00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:58,820
it turns out if you're doing it just for

00:10:56,180 --> 00:11:01,139
fun as soon as it's not fun you're going

00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:03,329
to be done and it will be not fun

00:11:01,139 --> 00:11:06,269
there will definitely be not fun and

00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:09,989
creating a product downside of learning

00:11:06,269 --> 00:11:12,149
is focus the world is a big place there

00:11:09,989 --> 00:11:14,670
are so many technologies so many things

00:11:12,149 --> 00:11:17,819
that you can learn just wandering out in

00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:19,799
learning things you know you can lose

00:11:17,819 --> 00:11:21,839
focus with that and it's not the most

00:11:19,799 --> 00:11:24,470
efficient way to learn frankly building

00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:28,350
a product but there can be something

00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:29,970
internal need solving that problem that

00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:32,149
you you just really want this great

00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:35,759
solution you understand it really well

00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:37,319
again a product with like a logo and

00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:40,499
branding and something that other people

00:11:37,319 --> 00:11:42,689
can use is a lot more overhead than just

00:11:40,499 --> 00:11:43,859
simply building it something building i

00:11:42,689 --> 00:11:45,569
think we probably all know this building

00:11:43,859 --> 00:11:50,189
something for yourself is a lot easier

00:11:45,569 --> 00:11:52,470
than building it for someone else lead

00:11:50,189 --> 00:11:55,499
generation the the problem with lead

00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:58,679
generation is that the clients that you

00:11:55,499 --> 00:12:00,749
tend to get with a free or very low cost

00:11:58,679 --> 00:12:03,059
version are people who want free a

00:12:00,749 --> 00:12:06,350
little bit very low cost things and so

00:12:03,059 --> 00:12:08,730
to go out and you know offer something

00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:10,919
that is free and that you know will get

00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:12,389
widely distributed most of the people

00:12:10,919 --> 00:12:13,679
who are really interested in it are

00:12:12,389 --> 00:12:15,809
going to want the free thing and they

00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:18,929
might contact you and think like I want

00:12:15,809 --> 00:12:22,110
one of these but the amount of people

00:12:18,929 --> 00:12:24,629
who can afford your services will be a

00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:28,739
very small percentage of that of that

00:12:24,629 --> 00:12:29,790
group the problem with thought

00:12:28,739 --> 00:12:31,769
leadership or the thing that you'll have

00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:34,319
to solve for with thought leadership the

00:12:31,769 --> 00:12:36,779
con is the burden of maintenance so if

00:12:34,319 --> 00:12:39,119
you go out and say that you are the best

00:12:36,779 --> 00:12:41,339
year the experts in Drupal magento

00:12:39,119 --> 00:12:44,819
integration use that example again if

00:12:41,339 --> 00:12:46,619
that starts not being a very good like

00:12:44,819 --> 00:12:48,509
you don't maintain the modules or the

00:12:46,619 --> 00:12:51,629
distributions or things like that all of

00:12:48,509 --> 00:12:53,579
the sudden it's the opposite right you

00:12:51,629 --> 00:12:55,019
can charge higher rates perhaps because

00:12:53,579 --> 00:12:57,209
you have this thought leadership

00:12:55,019 --> 00:12:58,350
position but if you don't stay on top of

00:12:57,209 --> 00:12:59,819
it you don't release the Drupal 8

00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:02,220
version you don't fix the bugs you know

00:12:59,819 --> 00:13:03,419
etc all of the sudden you're naked it's

00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:05,369
a double-edged sword it's a negative

00:13:03,419 --> 00:13:08,519
it's a it's a weight on your on your

00:13:05,369 --> 00:13:09,869
firm and for those of us who are

00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:12,539
interested in making money with these

00:13:09,869 --> 00:13:14,880
things I guarantee you you will make

00:13:12,539 --> 00:13:17,520
less money than if you were to do

00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:19,830
service right all of us in this room are

00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:21,480
here as services companies and we're

00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:24,900
successful enough to go to Barcelona

00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:27,480
Spain and come to a conference and spend

00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:31,680
time that we're not billing we know how

00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:34,500
to do services really well if your

00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:35,940
hourly rate is say a thought you say

00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:37,950
lets you charge a hundred dollars an

00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:40,170
hour and so if you would spend a

00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:41,340
thousand hours working for a client you

00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:45,930
would get a hundred thousand dollars

00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:48,240
just round numbers if you spent that

00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:50,160
instead on a product you spent that a

00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:53,250
thousand hours on the product you would

00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:55,070
have zero dollars zero dollars a hundred

00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:57,870
thousand dollars you will get more money

00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:59,340
making a service are you sorry charging

00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:02,160
your clients for a service the the

00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:03,540
hopeful thing is that you can charge for

00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,640
it enough and enough and enough enough

00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:08,910
enough way off in the future that you

00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:11,940
could get a million but it is a long

00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:13,500
time between now and then and that you

00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:16,860
really need to understand that there is

00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:19,320
no get-rich-quick scheme you're already

00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:22,890
in it we have you know all of us know

00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:24,930
how to do services we're again so now I

00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:27,030
would say so in the nodes grill example

00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:28,530
we actually did a good job of this we

00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:31,620
sat down and said like what are the

00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:33,540
things that we really care about fun

00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:34,650
learning and profit that was what we

00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:37,530
were up to you know there's a little bit

00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:40,070
of internal need there but again it was

00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:42,720
sort of overkill so this is how we

00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:44,850
prioritize the world but different you

00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:47,240
know products have different sort of

00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:50,070
rankings here so open publish which is a

00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:51,810
distribution again for the publishers

00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:54,000
it's about lead generation and thought

00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:55,860
leadership allows phase two to stand out

00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,510
in the market and have a lot of those

00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:59,790
kinds of clients contact them and then

00:14:57,510 --> 00:15:01,710
when they do to be able to charge a

00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:06,870
premium because they say we understand

00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:09,810
the space so well so be clear about why

00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:13,470
you're doing something and once you've

00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:16,800
got the wise you need to also take some

00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:18,480
time to define success again many of us

00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:23,610
who didn't do a really good job of this

00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:26,130
a wish that we had so if you don't know

00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:27,240
you're going it's a good chance you're

00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:28,220
not going to arrive you're going to

00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:31,540
spend time wandering

00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:34,010
around making weird decisions and

00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:36,860
eventually either maybe you'll make it I

00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:38,810
think there are many many many more

00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:40,250
examples and for all of the the positive

00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:43,160
examples that we have there there are a

00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:45,470
lot of non examples of people who

00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:48,020
started down the path had an idea made

00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:48,980
it a little ways and then you know they

00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:50,000
didn't have the goals in heaven

00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:51,410
motivations didn't know where they're

00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,940
going whatever reason they make it

00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:55,280
through I think one of the things that

00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:57,860
is easy to get lost on is if you don't

00:15:55,280 --> 00:16:00,380
have your success criteria map down

00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:01,940
we're going to have you know this many

00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:04,160
users by this amount of time or we're

00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:06,830
going to have you know we want if its

00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:09,620
lead generation we want a thousand leads

00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:11,120
in the next year or whatever it is come

00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:13,670
up with something you can change your

00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:16,070
mind later that's okay but know at least

00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:17,240
what you're judging yourself against

00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:19,760
because you're going to have hard

00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:22,250
decisions there will be times what you

00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:24,140
think is this worth it alright this is

00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:26,360
great I've learned some things we've

00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:30,290
tried some things do we keep doing it

00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:32,360
and that's a constant question if you

00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:35,200
can't come back to this sort of like

00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:40,370
what our goals how are we doing then

00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:41,570
it's a hard question to answer so if you

00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:43,160
know the question things like we should

00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:44,690
we actually i'm just going to do

00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:46,460
everyone a favor should we add a new

00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:49,970
feature could be a question you might

00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:52,670
ask yourself the answer is no do not add

00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:55,160
a new feature don't do that if you're in

00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:56,360
this room you should you know like we're

00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:59,090
all still figuring this out the answer

00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:00,740
is no no new features sponsor drupalcon

00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:04,220
that'd be great but you know figuring

00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:08,350
out all kinds of things your definition

00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:12,740
of success is going to be critical and

00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:15,560
and here actually in the words of addy

00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:17,480
who is in the room so this was you know

00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:19,190
i won't i won't read that although

00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:22,180
that's i'll let it you can all read

00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:24,980
faster than i would say it out loud

00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:29,900
there's a danger in not having this

00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:32,930
figured out not only for the product but

00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:35,530
for your agency so that having a limping

00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:39,410
half baked product inside your company

00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:40,900
can really mess with people so not only

00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:43,480
can it be you know sorta like

00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:45,670
a distraction of time and money it can

00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:48,000
also like why are we doing this cause

00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:52,180
sort of fundamental problems and such so

00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:53,260
again know where you're going you're

00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:59,320
going to have a much better chance of

00:17:53,260 --> 00:18:01,300
getting there how you get there there's

00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:03,580
really only a few choices and again each

00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:05,260
of these are going to have downsides you

00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:07,510
know upsides and downsides nights and

00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:09,580
weekends right we all have those we have

00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:11,440
times when we're not working being able

00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:14,410
to just work on a product during that

00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:17,230
time always an option free time inside

00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:20,050
of your firm is another thing like we

00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:22,060
have free time right where we aren't

00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:25,540
always working every single second for a

00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:28,150
client so the ability to use some that

00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:31,780
time to work on a product is great that

00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:34,150
works or you can spend money you can buy

00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:36,190
either your own internal time hire

00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:38,020
someone internally maybe to be devoted

00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:42,390
to it or hire someone externally as a

00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:47,080
contractor you these are the options and

00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:49,240
the downsides though is that while you

00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:52,150
have you know time and you have money

00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:54,790
you don't have enough because whatever

00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:57,450
it is you are going to be super tempted

00:18:54,790 --> 00:19:00,670
to you know it's you don't have enough

00:18:57,450 --> 00:19:03,460
all by itself and well nights and

00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:05,920
weekends line up for sort of like the

00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:08,620
fun and learning kinds of things if your

00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:12,310
goals include business objectives like

00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:15,100
thought leadership and sales leads and

00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:17,740
things like that doing it in nights and

00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:22,810
weekends is going to lose its charm very

00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:25,750
quickly so note squirrel the way we did

00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:27,690
it we we did our free time and the

00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:31,390
downside of that is it took us forever

00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:33,790
it was it was not good we spent a little

00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:36,280
bit of money but mostly it was free time

00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:41,350
and it was a struggle it was a really

00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:44,190
big struggle so did someone have a

00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:48,520
question that they started there alright

00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:53,779
so Alec who's not here but again Calla

00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:56,629
box this the tool for local development

00:19:53,779 --> 00:19:58,309
if you if it's not directly symbiotic

00:19:56,629 --> 00:20:00,739
start treating it as a separate business

00:19:58,309 --> 00:20:04,070
immediately even if you haven't formed a

00:20:00,739 --> 00:20:06,799
new entity around it make sure you

00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:16,639
understand how you're going to get there

00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:18,379
and take it seriously so once you kind

00:20:16,639 --> 00:20:22,009
of know like these sort of intellectual

00:20:18,379 --> 00:20:26,389
questions what are my goals and what's

00:20:22,009 --> 00:20:29,539
my success criteria you need to focus on

00:20:26,389 --> 00:20:31,700
the Minimum Viable Product and if the

00:20:29,539 --> 00:20:34,869
the term MVP is not one you're familiar

00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:37,460
with go Google that do a lot of reading

00:20:34,869 --> 00:20:39,259
again some of the lean stacks other

00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:40,909
resources and such but a Minimum Viable

00:20:39,259 --> 00:20:43,099
Product is I really like this definition

00:20:40,909 --> 00:20:46,849
is the smallest thing that you can build

00:20:43,099 --> 00:20:48,979
that delivers customer value and you

00:20:46,849 --> 00:20:52,190
know bonus if you can capture some of

00:20:48,979 --> 00:20:58,789
that back even better and that's meaning

00:20:52,190 --> 00:21:00,739
can you charge for it and this one I

00:20:58,789 --> 00:21:02,389
think is really really hard i already

00:21:00,739 --> 00:21:03,769
mentioned this for all of us who build

00:21:02,389 --> 00:21:05,509
things for a living we know how to build

00:21:03,769 --> 00:21:08,509
things we maybe have you know interface

00:21:05,509 --> 00:21:10,820
sort of like we think we we have we have

00:21:08,509 --> 00:21:12,979
well formed opinions about all kinds of

00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:14,599
things in building things the Minimum

00:21:12,979 --> 00:21:17,779
Viable Product I guarantee you is

00:21:14,599 --> 00:21:19,129
smaller than you think it is the minimum

00:21:17,779 --> 00:21:21,499
viable product that we built per node

00:21:19,129 --> 00:21:24,619
squirrel was a lot bigger than it needed

00:21:21,499 --> 00:21:26,330
to be it was it it was a medium ly

00:21:24,619 --> 00:21:31,820
viable product and probably every sense

00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:36,320
of the word so and again everyone

00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:38,089
everyone has ever attempted this has has

00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:40,129
this wisdom to share make it smaller

00:21:38,089 --> 00:21:41,509
right and i hope to challenge you

00:21:40,129 --> 00:21:43,429
actually with a with an idea of what's

00:21:41,509 --> 00:21:45,409
even smaller could be but christoph

00:21:43,429 --> 00:21:48,979
who's actually sitting in the back over

00:21:45,409 --> 00:21:50,629
there said it really quite well you're

00:21:48,979 --> 00:21:52,339
your own worst enemy i think this really

00:21:50,629 --> 00:21:53,690
applies to those of us again who are

00:21:52,339 --> 00:21:55,159
sick you know in the context of

00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:58,359
drupalcon where we build things for

00:21:55,159 --> 00:22:03,259
people we are our own worst enemies

00:21:58,359 --> 00:22:04,729
feature itís is not good adding a new

00:22:03,259 --> 00:22:07,590
feature to try and make the product

00:22:04,729 --> 00:22:08,820
better is almost always

00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:10,950
to try and make the product more viable

00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:13,169
is almost always the wrong choice it

00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:15,840
might need more marketing it might need

00:22:13,169 --> 00:22:22,919
a lot of things but it probably doesn't

00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:25,470
need a new feature so getting to the MVP

00:22:22,919 --> 00:22:26,429
involves a number of things you need to

00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:29,370
know what the problem is that you're

00:22:26,429 --> 00:22:30,779
solving you should have an identity like

00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:33,600
it's going to have it's a product it

00:22:30,779 --> 00:22:36,059
needs a name if you're a fancy you can

00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:37,529
give it a logo a color scheme and a

00:22:36,059 --> 00:22:40,710
brand identity and all of those kinds of

00:22:37,529 --> 00:22:43,190
things but even that can be thinner you

00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:45,990
need to understand your audience and

00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:49,020
have an idea of how you're going to

00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:51,059
reach that audience that one again for

00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:53,490
us and I think for many people again is

00:22:51,059 --> 00:22:54,390
a tricky one and then finally you're

00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:56,159
going to need to figure out what the

00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:57,090
pricing is going to be if you don't

00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:58,830
figure it you're going to have a lot of

00:22:57,090 --> 00:23:00,809
questions about it if you know it's free

00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:05,070
or not is there a free version if there

00:23:00,809 --> 00:23:06,899
is not free versions etc so again for an

00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:09,960
old squirrel if the problem was off-site

00:23:06,899 --> 00:23:11,340
backup and we came up we had a name we

00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,990
came up with the name node squirrel we

00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:15,809
had a brand in a logo and it still

00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:17,700
exists actually an audit are our

00:23:15,809 --> 00:23:19,830
audience was anyone using a Drupal site

00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:21,990
our path to market we were super

00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:23,789
fortunate back up in my grade is a

00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:26,549
module that's widely used already and

00:23:23,789 --> 00:23:27,630
that's a module that we maintain and we

00:23:26,549 --> 00:23:29,730
came up with it's going to be five

00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:31,799
dollars had to just sort of pick numbers

00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:33,960
it's now free actually and sort of like

00:23:31,799 --> 00:23:36,690
a sidebar once Pantheon bought node

00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:38,520
squirrel it made notes cool the base to

00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:41,640
your free so if you don't have a

00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:44,399
reliable off-site backup for your

00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:46,980
various sites you know just go create a

00:23:44,399 --> 00:23:52,770
free account its free forever and you

00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:55,130
can backup your site so we produced as

00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:59,700
part of that so getting two nodes girl

00:23:55,130 --> 00:24:03,590
we produced a website and all a whole

00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:07,770
lot of work to get to this i would say

00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:10,950
doing a different if our motivators had

00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:12,419
been purely profit there's actually

00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:15,059
something that was like the first time I

00:24:12,419 --> 00:24:18,179
heard about it I was actually really

00:24:15,059 --> 00:24:20,460
taken back by it the idea that actually

00:24:18,179 --> 00:24:21,100
what your MVP is looks maybe more like

00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:22,570
this

00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:23,980
and this is antithetical perhaps to

00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:27,610
again the way many of us approach a

00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:29,500
problem the idea that if you're building

00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:31,270
node squirrel the right place to start

00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:32,230
is not engineering it and building it in

00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:33,850
the back of a magnet and do all those

00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:38,380
things what you need is a landing page

00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:41,440
that says note squirrel back up yay and

00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:44,169
it has a button on it that says try now

00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:46,240
or by now or whatever it is you build up

00:24:44,169 --> 00:24:49,690
age sort of talking about what what this

00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:51,820
thing is you have a uniform it goes to

00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:53,409
on the other side you get people to it

00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:55,270
via Google Adwords or something like

00:24:53,409 --> 00:24:57,280
that and then you have some metrics

00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:58,690
something that's tracking how many times

00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:02,289
somebody clicked on this and clicked on

00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:04,990
that they click on sign up now at five

00:25:02,289 --> 00:25:08,049
dollars a month or whatever it is they

00:25:04,990 --> 00:25:09,850
get to the page it says thank you we're

00:25:08,049 --> 00:25:13,059
so glad you're interested in our product

00:25:09,850 --> 00:25:14,380
it'll be out soon and a nice email and

00:25:13,059 --> 00:25:16,210
you have their email address will send

00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:19,840
you an email as soon as it's ready to go

00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:21,850
and that's all and when I first heard

00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:25,809
about that I thought that that was just

00:25:21,850 --> 00:25:27,520
like I didn't like it it was you know it

00:25:25,809 --> 00:25:29,650
feels a little bit like you're promising

00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:32,200
something I had problems with it but in

00:25:29,650 --> 00:25:34,330
the years since you know sort of made

00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:35,650
known squirrel in like I heard that

00:25:34,330 --> 00:25:39,600
maybe a year or two into the product

00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:42,970
project I wish I'd heard it sooner

00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:45,190
because it is such as it would have been

00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:48,730
such a shortcut to a lot of learning

00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:51,250
that a you know hopefully it's something

00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:53,710
you know the Minimum Viable Product

00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:56,200
could be a lot smaller and it might not

00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:57,700
actually involve a lot of the amazing

00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:59,440
talents that we in this room have

00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:02,110
there's not a lot of programming here

00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:05,370
there's some design there's but like

00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:08,919
this is a shockingly small thing and

00:26:05,370 --> 00:26:11,500
really anyone can do it and so I think

00:26:08,919 --> 00:26:15,130
for all of us having the discipline to

00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:17,880
try to be as small as possible is really

00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:21,720
the thing that we all have to focus on

00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:25,210
and that brings us to the next problem

00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:29,650
you need customers more than features

00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:32,110
and this is really really true and we're

00:26:29,650 --> 00:26:33,429
going to want to just dumb try to

00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:34,669
demonstrate this we're going to see you

00:26:33,429 --> 00:26:37,039
live demo time

00:26:34,669 --> 00:26:38,480
so how many of you all right so managed

00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:40,100
roopa websites actually already heard

00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:42,320
that but how many people manage drupal

00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:44,539
websites great all right most everybody

00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:45,590
how many before now before I started

00:26:44,539 --> 00:26:46,519
yammering and before reading the

00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:49,340
sessions are different how many of you

00:26:46,519 --> 00:26:50,389
had heard of nodes squirrel ok cool Wow

00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:52,220
oh this is going to go well all right

00:26:50,389 --> 00:26:54,529
how many of you knew what it was at

00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:55,820
least bagley like I knew it was in you

00:26:54,529 --> 00:26:57,679
know like you've--you the word back up

00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:58,999
all right how many of you thought it was

00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:00,379
a good idea for and I should be I'm

00:26:58,999 --> 00:27:02,720
sorry I should be like listing this out

00:27:00,379 --> 00:27:04,070
so I manage Drupal websites most

00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:05,299
everybody in the room heard of node

00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:06,470
squirrel is actually pretty good like i

00:27:05,299 --> 00:27:09,109
would say eighty percent of the room

00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:10,399
knew what it was sixty percent how many

00:27:09,109 --> 00:27:12,499
thought it was a great idea maybe said

00:27:10,399 --> 00:27:14,059
something nice about it so we're down to

00:27:12,499 --> 00:27:16,429
twenty percent of them so like I how

00:27:14,059 --> 00:27:21,169
many of you tried it dropping quickly

00:27:16,429 --> 00:27:23,690
right good how many of you bought it 22

00:27:21,169 --> 00:27:25,159
to that's actually that statistically

00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:27,409
asked what I was hoping for actually I

00:27:25,159 --> 00:27:29,840
thought two to three that's about right

00:27:27,409 --> 00:27:31,879
and here we are in the you know the

00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:34,070
place in the world right now with the

00:27:31,879 --> 00:27:36,950
deepest fullest concentration of our

00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:39,769
audience and we had some you know like

00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:42,799
we have a lot of you know nice press

00:27:39,769 --> 00:27:44,989
about us and such the world's a big

00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:46,960
place there's a lot of messages and

00:27:44,989 --> 00:27:49,340
going the the difference between

00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:52,999
specifically thought it was a great idea

00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:55,279
which was maybe twenty percent to bought

00:27:52,999 --> 00:27:57,679
it which is about two is really

00:27:55,279 --> 00:28:00,220
interesting if someone tells you that's

00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:03,649
a great idea I really want to use it

00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:06,230
they might not actually want to use it

00:28:03,649 --> 00:28:07,460
they might just be polite or they'll

00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:09,499
think they you know they might actually

00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:11,869
think that they would but when it comes

00:28:09,499 --> 00:28:15,249
to it like other things to do today not

00:28:11,869 --> 00:28:19,700
going to happen and this is this is

00:28:15,249 --> 00:28:23,359
where marketing is so again many of us

00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:25,369
in small firms don't have a dedicated

00:28:23,359 --> 00:28:27,889
marketing person and maybe just don't

00:28:25,369 --> 00:28:33,769
have like a deep understanding for what

00:28:27,889 --> 00:28:36,679
it means to do marketing so you know at

00:28:33,769 --> 00:28:39,139
the business session yesterday we had a

00:28:36,679 --> 00:28:40,249
conversation and I recognized one of the

00:28:39,139 --> 00:28:42,049
people might tell exactly we were

00:28:40,249 --> 00:28:43,759
talking about this so is all the

00:28:42,049 --> 00:28:45,830
instalike the business summit yesterday

00:28:43,759 --> 00:28:47,659
and so a lot of people you know running

00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:48,450
businesses and such we're talking about

00:28:47,659 --> 00:28:50,760
how big

00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:52,320
team before you actually need a full

00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:54,270
time marketing person and week the

00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:56,190
consensus we came to is about 25 to 30

00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:57,480
people and then you know that's the

00:28:56,190 --> 00:28:59,940
point at which full time marketing is

00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:01,320
makes sense and that's somebody's just

00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:04,800
focusing on getting out messages and

00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:06,210
like making sure you're visible and I

00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:08,370
think that ratio is about right it's

00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:10,950
like 130 like you should not start

00:29:08,370 --> 00:29:13,290
marketing you know things at you know 30

00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:14,910
people but that's the point at which

00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:18,690
it's enough for a full time person's

00:29:14,910 --> 00:29:20,550
brain with the product I think that

00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:22,290
answer is closer to four nodes squirrel

00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:25,350
did not actually make it to a

00:29:22,290 --> 00:29:27,780
four-person team before we join pantheon

00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:30,780
but if we had made it to four and one of

00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:33,300
them wasn't in marketing I would have

00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:38,490
been an idiot I might not who knows you

00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:40,350
know having gone to pantheon it's really

00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:43,320
interesting for me so Pantheon is a team

00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:46,380
of about 80 people right now and there

00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:48,000
are three major disciplines there's well

00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:50,640
the three biggest disciplines are

00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,500
engineering which is about 20 and

00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:56,280
they're similar in size about 20 ish

00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:57,960
people support you know people helping

00:29:56,280 --> 00:30:01,170
people use the platform answer tickets

00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:04,470
etc about 20 people and marketing about

00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:06,540
20 ish people like it's about a quarter

00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:07,740
of what we do by a number of human

00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:10,860
beings and the rest there's there's

00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:13,100
folks in sales there's folks in HR and

00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:15,990
other things and the leadership and such

00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:19,950
but it's about a quarter of what we have

00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:22,260
to do in order to be viable and that is

00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:25,290
a hugely I mean that's just that's a

00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:27,180
that's a crazy difference and you might

00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:29,700
even want to consider you know starting

00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:31,470
off your first person might actually as

00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:33,750
soon as you've got it built your first

00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:41,490
person might want to be doing almost all

00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:46,740
marketing so again putting it all

00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:50,130
together making sure you have your goals

00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:52,440
set out be clear about those understand

00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:53,790
what you're you know what is it that's

00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:55,680
motivating why are you willing to take

00:30:53,790 --> 00:30:58,620
this on because when you know when the

00:30:55,680 --> 00:31:00,420
path gets dark and scary and it's not

00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:02,360
fun anymore you're going to need to come

00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:06,240
back and check is this still worth it

00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:10,370
and make sure you've got that success

00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:14,940
criteria set out have those methods

00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:16,610
decided upon make it really small much

00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:20,490
smaller than you then you imagine and

00:31:16,610 --> 00:31:24,300
and then just focus on marketing you get

00:31:20,490 --> 00:31:27,180
the word out and that is the way to make

00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:28,860
it through and actually have the the

00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:30,120
sustainability for people to keep

00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:32,250
cutting you know people using your

00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:33,630
product will make it more sustainable so

00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:34,800
you can keep building it but if you

00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:36,570
don't have that marketing piece in there

00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:39,480
if that's not already something of

00:31:36,570 --> 00:31:44,040
thinking a lot about that's a big blind

00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:45,150
spot I did that way faster than I did I

00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:47,430
don't know what must have like sped up

00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:49,020
my speaking by a fair amount that is

00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:50,610
actually what I wanted to cover today i

00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:53,220
knew i would have time for questions and

00:31:50,610 --> 00:31:55,020
answers there are a number of us i'm

00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:57,150
actually going to call you out again I

00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:58,650
see how many of you have a product that

00:31:57,150 --> 00:32:00,720
you have produced that is out in the

00:31:58,650 --> 00:32:04,200
market that someone could go use today

00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:06,030
has a logo etc awesome home that's

00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:08,310
fantastic alright so I hope you look

00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:10,170
around I am happy to answer questions I

00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:12,950
might ask for you know insights from the

00:32:10,170 --> 00:32:18,000
room as well so I'm going to call that

00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:21,630
done oh and thank you great great talk

00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:23,550
yeah thank you could Joe and so one

00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:27,000
thing it's not so much a question it's

00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:29,190
more kind of a reframing one thing that

00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:32,600
I've been thinking a lot more about

00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:36,210
lately is that there's something called

00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:38,640
productized services and if you want to

00:32:36,210 --> 00:32:41,400
productize and you want to get well

00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:43,020
ultimately if you do it for the money if

00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:45,240
you build a product for the money it's

00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:47,430
all about getting more leverage on your

00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:48,630
time so like making more money for the

00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:51,000
same amount of time that you spend

00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:53,010
that's the end goal cool but there's a

00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,720
shortcut for that like you don't have to

00:32:53,010 --> 00:32:59,059
go to the Batcave and start building

00:32:54,720 --> 00:33:01,309
products and as engineers this is a very

00:32:59,059 --> 00:33:05,480
very difficult thing to do or like we

00:33:01,309 --> 00:33:07,340
just start building but maybe what you

00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:09,259
really should be doing is defining a

00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:12,019
process like figuring out what what are

00:33:09,259 --> 00:33:15,049
your ideal customers like what has been

00:33:12,019 --> 00:33:19,909
working really well and then process if

00:33:15,049 --> 00:33:21,950
I that service and figuring out like how

00:33:19,909 --> 00:33:23,059
what is going to be your process that

00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:25,159
you're going to be doing over and over

00:33:23,059 --> 00:33:26,929
and over again and that way increase

00:33:25,159 --> 00:33:30,379
your margin yeah now you can you can

00:33:26,929 --> 00:33:35,269
charge a fixed fee which is much higher

00:33:30,379 --> 00:33:38,149
than your hourly rate and specialized be

00:33:35,269 --> 00:33:39,860
more referral get people to know you for

00:33:38,149 --> 00:33:41,659
that service and actually make more

00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:45,950
money that way and that's this is a

00:33:41,659 --> 00:33:47,809
really hard lesson that that's that I

00:33:45,950 --> 00:33:50,899
think is important to know about yeah

00:33:47,809 --> 00:33:53,509
absolutely yeah turns out we know how to

00:33:50,899 --> 00:33:55,700
do one thing really really well getting

00:33:53,509 --> 00:34:00,860
better at that is is an incremental step

00:33:55,700 --> 00:34:02,690
that that that's a lot closer to achieve

00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:05,360
abul than it is building a whole product

00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:06,679
it's a fun journey you know like yay us

00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:09,079
for doing it you know like everybody

00:34:06,679 --> 00:34:11,919
here is doing it it is fun it it's i'm

00:34:09,079 --> 00:34:16,000
very happy i sat down on the path but

00:34:11,919 --> 00:34:16,000
it's also got hard spots

00:34:19,919 --> 00:34:25,600
but yeah so the question is how do you

00:34:23,169 --> 00:34:30,400
see open source in the community what

00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:34,150
are the pros and cons so obviously so

00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:35,410
and actually I think I can speak for a

00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:37,060
number of people who answered similar

00:34:35,410 --> 00:34:40,390
kinds of questions as I was preparing

00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:41,770
for this the wonderful thing about open

00:34:40,390 --> 00:34:44,050
sources allows you to iterate and

00:34:41,770 --> 00:34:47,140
prototype really rapidly on a pretty

00:34:44,050 --> 00:34:50,040
robust framework and you know Drupal in

00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:53,230
particular is a great tool to build with

00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:57,850
the the problem is intellectual property

00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:59,890
so someone like if you for example our

00:34:57,850 --> 00:35:02,080
phase 2 and you have open published and

00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:04,660
you have this distribution you also have

00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:06,520
what Greece called I think famously the

00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:08,890
most expensive lead generation tool ever

00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:12,010
invented it took a lot of time and money

00:35:08,890 --> 00:35:13,840
for them to produce that and there is

00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:15,940
zero chance for them I mean they could

00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:19,390
charge some money for it but it's open

00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:21,430
source it is you know completely open

00:35:19,390 --> 00:35:24,340
intellectual property and so they

00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:26,340
couldn't really you know it it would be

00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:29,410
highly unlikely that anyone would buy it

00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:31,030
more than say five times and without

00:35:29,410 --> 00:35:33,640
angering enough people so it just

00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:37,570
doesn't make a lot of sense the places

00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:40,300
where where people have been successful

00:35:37,570 --> 00:35:42,040
I think is when they have something

00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:43,660
there's like a recurring fee for

00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:46,390
something so for example Drupal eyes me

00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:48,310
or note squirrel or pantheon for that

00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:50,080
matter we all kind of are used to the

00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:53,110
world is sort of used to paying for

00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:54,310
those kinds of services so pent hosting

00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:56,200
we sort of get that their servers

00:35:54,310 --> 00:35:58,060
running somewhere so anything you can do

00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:59,200
that sort of ties in or Drupal eyes me

00:35:58,060 --> 00:36:02,410
you sort of get that you're tying into

00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:03,640
this like library of learning anything

00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:06,310
you can do this sort of ties into

00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:08,710
something that the mindset is already

00:36:06,310 --> 00:36:10,240
there for 4 i'm willing to pay for this

00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:15,040
i understand that there's something here

00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:16,210
is is way more viable and that's that

00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:17,890
can be a tricky you mean like the Venn

00:36:16,210 --> 00:36:19,720
diagram of that and open source is not a

00:36:17,890 --> 00:36:25,070
huge overlap but there are definitely

00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:28,220
places there sorry

00:36:25,070 --> 00:36:30,890
open SAS yeah absolutely do you have an

00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:34,550
example in mind or are you thinking of

00:36:30,890 --> 00:36:36,520
something particular but ok alright well

00:36:34,550 --> 00:36:43,580
we'll wait all right awesome good luck

00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:45,740
yes great obsession um I suppose most of

00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:50,330
us sell services like you said so we're

00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:52,190
more used to doing marketing through

00:36:50,330 --> 00:36:55,520
thought leadership blogging and coming

00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:57,920
to conferences so we're pretty good at

00:36:55,520 --> 00:37:01,640
that I think um we want to be good at

00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:03,470
them in terms of a product do you think

00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:05,750
there's like a formula that we can use

00:37:03,470 --> 00:37:07,340
to create marketing without putting

00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:09,980
money into this I mean you talked about

00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:12,020
Edwards so you know you create your

00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:13,970
landing page like you said you put your

00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:15,590
call to action you make people register

00:37:13,970 --> 00:37:19,280
they're going to curse at you because

00:37:15,590 --> 00:37:21,320
the products not ready yes but then you

00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:23,530
have to take people to your site how do

00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:26,030
you do that how do you do that for b2b

00:37:23,530 --> 00:37:27,800
do you guys have any experience I mean

00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:29,630
you can share from pantheon oh yeah

00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:31,070
absolutely so i'll give an answer i

00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:35,960
think Christoph's gotta like an answer

00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:37,100
he wants to give to so so for that to do

00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:39,310
it like one of the things you said that

00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:42,760
jumped out at me was to do it for free

00:37:39,310 --> 00:37:45,020
no I mean I don't think if we you know

00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:46,940
if I had a magic wand that'd be great

00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:50,690
but I I know of no way to do that for

00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:52,160
free that doesn't involve do you all

00:37:50,690 --> 00:37:54,350
right excellent I mean that that doesn't

00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:57,680
correspondingly involve a huge trade off

00:37:54,350 --> 00:37:59,300
of time right there's there's no it's

00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:02,210
one or the other and you're paying with

00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:05,210
something not enough that I can expound

00:38:02,210 --> 00:38:07,220
but so what we did with Walker so walk

00:38:05,210 --> 00:38:09,260
hope is basically an alternative

00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:11,680
alternative for walk knee which is a

00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:14,390
really expensive Enterprise Service and

00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:17,300
some rebuilt we made a web we made a

00:38:14,390 --> 00:38:21,380
blog post titled free and open-source

00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:23,210
alternatives for walk me and we did a

00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:26,420
review of a bunch of other tools and

00:38:23,210 --> 00:38:28,670
then there was also walk up and we are

00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:29,780
until today without doing any effort at

00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:32,510
all at all

00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:35,540
get weekly 23 signups for walk me

00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:40,160
because for woke up because of that so

00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:42,200
you can just do marketing jiu-jitsu with

00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:44,270
your open source tool this is if you do

00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:46,040
an open source tool or if you do a

00:38:44,270 --> 00:38:48,590
cheaper tool although that I wouldn't go

00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:51,290
for cheaper version of something don't

00:38:48,590 --> 00:38:52,640
do that it's a bad idea but if you go to

00:38:51,290 --> 00:38:54,560
open source through it and have another

00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:56,660
this is Smallville around that then you

00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:58,520
can you can you can do it that way with

00:38:56,660 --> 00:39:01,090
very very little effort and very little

00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:03,830
money and just get a steady stream of

00:39:01,090 --> 00:39:05,930
leads come yeah actually all right so

00:39:03,830 --> 00:39:09,980
that that is X right thank you that was

00:39:05,930 --> 00:39:15,350
a good a better answer in some ways the

00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:17,090
so using a really smart analysis of your

00:39:15,350 --> 00:39:19,100
market and then figuring out what

00:39:17,090 --> 00:39:20,690
content you can produce is something you

00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:22,070
definitely should be doing that is a

00:39:20,690 --> 00:39:23,750
great stat that like one article

00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:27,490
producing two three signups a week

00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:27,490
that's excellent other questions

00:39:34,789 --> 00:39:39,089
yeah so the question is would note

00:39:37,349 --> 00:39:41,549
scroll have been a successful product if

00:39:39,089 --> 00:39:49,380
we sort of quit set everything aside and

00:39:41,549 --> 00:39:51,839
just focused on that yeah so one of the

00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:53,640
things as I did the timeline so we

00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:58,170
started working on node school in 2011

00:39:53,640 --> 00:40:00,989
and here you know in 2015 pantheon

00:39:58,170 --> 00:40:03,749
purchased it and it had grown like all

00:40:00,989 --> 00:40:06,719
of the numbers were nice but it hadn't

00:40:03,749 --> 00:40:11,279
you know like it would still below a

00:40:06,719 --> 00:40:13,859
single full-time person's salary so if

00:40:11,279 --> 00:40:17,279
we had just said right we're going to

00:40:13,859 --> 00:40:18,539
set aside $300,000 we're going to turn

00:40:17,279 --> 00:40:20,279
off everything else I'm going to focus

00:40:18,539 --> 00:40:24,509
down on this world or done we would

00:40:20,279 --> 00:40:25,589
gotten a lot faster I don't know if it

00:40:24,509 --> 00:40:30,289
would have been a success though because

00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:34,699
I the the long time horizon actually

00:40:30,289 --> 00:40:38,189
probably helped us survive more mistakes

00:40:34,699 --> 00:40:39,929
right so we were slow and learning

00:40:38,189 --> 00:40:43,160
slowly I don't know if we would have

00:40:39,929 --> 00:40:45,719
learned as fast probably we would have I

00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:48,709
don't know that's a hard I don't know I

00:40:45,719 --> 00:40:51,900
honestly don't know I'd like to think so

00:40:48,709 --> 00:40:54,029
well it's a risky one though right

00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:55,709
burning this you know again you know how

00:40:54,029 --> 00:40:56,849
to you know how to do something pretty

00:40:55,709 --> 00:41:00,269
well to be able to make it to these

00:40:56,849 --> 00:41:04,039
chairs it's always there and go back to

00:41:00,269 --> 00:41:04,039
it but it's a pretty bold move

00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:10,390
yep

00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:33,850
actually I knowing you yeah this is

00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:39,460
gonna be good advice can you take the

00:41:33,850 --> 00:41:40,930
mic please no no come on what's the

00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:46,150
product as well can you all reminds like

00:41:40,930 --> 00:41:47,920
traveling in Italy is like the almost oh

00:41:46,150 --> 00:41:48,970
this is bad like I'm one of the people

00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:55,660
who said I thought it was great and

00:41:48,970 --> 00:42:02,020
didn't buy it sorry about that all right

00:41:55,660 --> 00:42:05,470
all right a little musical interlude so

00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:08,380
we're room if I and we do booking

00:42:05,470 --> 00:42:10,540
solutions for so the travel connection

00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:15,600
is for vacation rentals hotels and so on

00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:19,660
so we left the agency side of things and

00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:24,100
there it was this six months we left six

00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:27,160
months ago and launched SAS service two

00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:33,220
weeks ago or yeah almost two weeks ago

00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:34,960
congratulations I hope but we were kind

00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:37,780
of doing the range of things so you have

00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:39,490
a SAS service which is thirty dollars a

00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:41,770
month and you get your vacation rental

00:42:39,490 --> 00:42:43,990
website and then on the other side of

00:42:41,770 --> 00:42:45,790
things we have what crystal was talking

00:42:43,990 --> 00:42:49,590
about which is kind of a product eyes

00:42:45,790 --> 00:42:51,970
service in that as you are getting

00:42:49,590 --> 00:42:54,070
talking to bigger companies that need

00:42:51,970 --> 00:42:56,260
customizations you have a base product

00:42:54,070 --> 00:42:59,020
which is a distro and you customize it

00:42:56,260 --> 00:43:01,650
for them now that the choice that we

00:42:59,020 --> 00:43:04,900
made was to make all of these open cells

00:43:01,650 --> 00:43:07,000
so it's all on github somewhere that

00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:09,730
people can download customers don't

00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,990
actually our customers like the people

00:43:09,730 --> 00:43:13,090
that actually want to give us money

00:43:10,990 --> 00:43:15,460
don't care about that because they don't

00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:17,860
know Drupal at all they don't know open

00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:22,960
source at all so it's like can you give

00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:24,970
me what I need and that was a really

00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:27,190
good lesson and the other one was it's

00:43:24,970 --> 00:43:27,780
good to go for Minimum Viable Product

00:43:27,190 --> 00:43:30,750
absolute

00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:34,790
me but be very careful about the viable

00:43:30,750 --> 00:43:37,890
part of things it's like customers will

00:43:34,790 --> 00:43:39,510
take the competitors page and just go

00:43:37,890 --> 00:43:42,270
through it and say so do you have this

00:43:39,510 --> 00:43:45,180
do you have this do you have this and if

00:43:42,270 --> 00:43:46,500
you don't you need a good answer to you

00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:49,500
know how are they going to solve that

00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:52,230
problem so it's it's minimum yes but it

00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:55,770
has to be viable and that is just as

00:43:52,230 --> 00:43:58,350
important and that's pretty much where

00:43:55,770 --> 00:44:00,120
we are right now awesome awesome so six

00:43:58,350 --> 00:44:01,950
months so I'm curious so like if you

00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:05,180
were answering the question about like

00:44:01,950 --> 00:44:08,670
is it okay to to ditch the agency life

00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:15,270
focus it down on it how are you feeling

00:44:08,670 --> 00:44:17,970
how would you answer that so I think my

00:44:15,270 --> 00:44:19,620
view right now is that it can be i agree

00:44:17,970 --> 00:44:22,800
with you it can be done within an agency

00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:25,680
but it's really really hard and it's

00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:29,430
probably easier because you're going to

00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:31,620
fail faster if you ditch the agency life

00:44:29,430 --> 00:44:34,110
and just did yourself and if you're

00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:36,420
going to do it within an agency create a

00:44:34,110 --> 00:44:38,970
separate comes with a separate team and

00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:40,440
all of that that's what we got draw my

00:44:38,970 --> 00:44:43,590
thing and we were kind of messing around

00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:46,080
with rooms for two years or something

00:44:43,590 --> 00:44:48,150
and it was just not getting anywhere we

00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:51,480
had nice things we could show people

00:44:48,150 --> 00:44:53,370
landing pages and so on but now it's an

00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:56,460
actual product and it's only been six

00:44:53,370 --> 00:44:59,610
months and in terms of the marketing

00:44:56,460 --> 00:45:02,400
question our marketing is thought

00:44:59,610 --> 00:45:07,200
leadership I mean look very carefully at

00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:10,080
what the what the domain is any domain

00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:12,180
requires people that think about it

00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:14,070
create content and in our case it's

00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:16,650
vacation rentals and hotels and so on

00:45:14,070 --> 00:45:18,030
and there's a lot to be said about you

00:45:16,650 --> 00:45:19,230
know how they should be building their

00:45:18,030 --> 00:45:22,260
websites and what they should be doing

00:45:19,230 --> 00:45:25,640
and with Drupal we have a huge advantage

00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:28,410
because while our competitors are

00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:31,200
focusing kind of building everything

00:45:28,410 --> 00:45:32,690
themselves like they building a CMS and

00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:34,550
then they're building a book

00:45:32,690 --> 00:45:36,200
engine and then they have to keep up

00:45:34,550 --> 00:45:38,810
with the rest of the web in terms of

00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:40,819
things happening we just do the booking

00:45:38,810 --> 00:45:44,420
engine and we get commerce from Drupal

00:45:40,819 --> 00:45:45,920
commerce and all the latest widgets that

00:45:44,420 --> 00:45:47,660
you could add to your website from all

00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:49,849
the people that immediately create a

00:45:47,660 --> 00:45:52,460
module as soon as some service pop song

00:45:49,849 --> 00:45:55,460
so we have a huge advantage in terms of

00:45:52,460 --> 00:45:58,400
how quickly we can iterate there's lots

00:45:55,460 --> 00:46:01,220
of problems with that as well but it's

00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:10,010
all good awesome congratulations thank

00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:12,319
you it is no questions comment

00:46:10,010 --> 00:46:14,300
essentially one of the points which you

00:46:12,319 --> 00:46:16,339
mentioned what profit has lost in your

00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:18,050
table I think people who are going to

00:46:16,339 --> 00:46:20,690
fund it would put right up in the dub

00:46:18,050 --> 00:46:25,250
right up on the top essentially up the

00:46:20,690 --> 00:46:27,829
table a question related to that is well

00:46:25,250 --> 00:46:30,140
you did mention the hourly rate and now

00:46:27,829 --> 00:46:33,710
the return of that is there a time

00:46:30,140 --> 00:46:37,310
period which we should look at how much

00:46:33,710 --> 00:46:42,760
should we burn before we call it quits

00:46:37,310 --> 00:46:44,210
or being successful yeah so I think I

00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:45,770
unfortunately I don't think there's an

00:46:44,210 --> 00:46:47,960
easy answer but I think the way which

00:46:45,770 --> 00:46:50,210
you answer that oath that was recorded

00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:53,030
right so the way in which you have to

00:46:50,210 --> 00:46:55,640
answer that really goes back to those

00:46:53,030 --> 00:46:58,190
motivators so the more boxes you can

00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:59,450
tick in that is it learning is it fun

00:46:58,190 --> 00:47:01,490
are you solving your internal needs

00:46:59,450 --> 00:47:04,550
thought leadership the more of those

00:47:01,490 --> 00:47:08,660
that this is solving the larger your

00:47:04,550 --> 00:47:11,150
budget can be so if it's just profit for

00:47:08,660 --> 00:47:15,560
example it's almost like a VC model or

00:47:11,150 --> 00:47:17,420
something but it well so again that

00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:18,619
that's something you'll understand the

00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:21,710
market and the size of the opportunity

00:47:18,619 --> 00:47:23,270
for whatever your idea is one other

00:47:21,710 --> 00:47:25,430
thing that actually I just want to

00:47:23,270 --> 00:47:27,260
reiterate that this sooner whether or

00:47:25,430 --> 00:47:30,050
not you quit the agency life or not is

00:47:27,260 --> 00:47:33,829
is a you know open question the sooner

00:47:30,050 --> 00:47:37,010
you can put dedicated people on the the

00:47:33,829 --> 00:47:38,960
idea the that's the spot where a lot of

00:47:37,010 --> 00:47:41,060
successful people have said like that's

00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:42,500
that was it like that was the thing when

00:47:41,060 --> 00:47:44,060
we got somebody who wasn't just being

00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:45,930
squeezed in around the edges you know

00:47:44,060 --> 00:47:48,480
every Tuesday they got to work for two

00:47:45,930 --> 00:47:51,690
or something whatever it was having a

00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:53,220
dedicated person was he a critical path

00:47:51,690 --> 00:47:55,200
to success and treating them and

00:47:53,220 --> 00:47:58,020
respecting that not like you get to do

00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:59,790
this occasionally it's like that is your

00:47:58,020 --> 00:48:01,950
job I saw a couple heads nodding like

00:47:59,790 --> 00:48:05,160
there were other did you have something

00:48:01,950 --> 00:48:07,170
man go ahead okay I have a comment and

00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:09,390
I'm question I'm pedaling it from from

00:48:07,170 --> 00:48:13,260
common Norway we have a couple of

00:48:09,390 --> 00:48:14,609
products so this quick learner mentioned

00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:16,940
that there's there's another way to

00:48:14,609 --> 00:48:19,550
think about products as well and that's

00:48:16,940 --> 00:48:23,609
what we did with our newspaper

00:48:19,550 --> 00:48:26,099
distribution which is now sort of like a

00:48:23,609 --> 00:48:29,329
cloud solution for a decoupled cloud

00:48:26,099 --> 00:48:31,349
solutions and then we have a newspaper

00:48:29,329 --> 00:48:33,780
clients coming to us one in that

00:48:31,349 --> 00:48:36,750
solution it's not self service or

00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:40,109
anything there's no you no place to

00:48:36,750 --> 00:48:42,660
login or pay or anything like that but

00:48:40,109 --> 00:48:45,690
it's like a place you can go you get a

00:48:42,660 --> 00:48:47,490
football newspaper solution and we have

00:48:45,690 --> 00:48:53,220
tons of design elements and things like

00:48:47,490 --> 00:48:56,190
that but then the price is very low they

00:48:53,220 --> 00:48:59,640
play they pay a monthly fee but of

00:48:56,190 --> 00:49:04,650
course they always want more so it's

00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:08,069
like a perfect mix of just off-the-shelf

00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:10,799
stuff and then you then we get all the

00:49:08,069 --> 00:49:13,020
you know the integrations and custom

00:49:10,799 --> 00:49:15,119
designs and new functionality and stuff

00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:17,849
like that and then we ship and we have a

00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:19,410
very special contract so that we new

00:49:17,849 --> 00:49:24,000
features from other clients we share

00:49:19,410 --> 00:49:27,690
with new clients basically so it doesn't

00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:30,869
really mean more work for us it does

00:49:27,690 --> 00:49:32,819
mean that we have to think a bit

00:49:30,869 --> 00:49:35,010
different and plan better or when we

00:49:32,819 --> 00:49:36,270
start working with you clients or

00:49:35,010 --> 00:49:39,359
something but now we have like 10

00:49:36,270 --> 00:49:42,420
newspapers built off the same actually

00:49:39,359 --> 00:49:45,450
it's the same github repository cool

00:49:42,420 --> 00:49:48,750
just go oh but also have a question in

00:49:45,450 --> 00:49:51,059
that guard we have some stuff around

00:49:48,750 --> 00:49:53,910
that distribution that we would like to

00:49:51,059 --> 00:49:54,680
open source but at the same time some of

00:49:53,910 --> 00:49:57,680
them

00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:59,810
we've invested heavily in them so we've

00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:02,450
experimented with the idea maybe we

00:49:59,810 --> 00:50:06,830
could you know monetize these things

00:50:02,450 --> 00:50:09,800
somehow but I haven't really seen many

00:50:06,830 --> 00:50:16,010
successes and trying to monetize

00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:17,690
products in the Drupal yeah community in

00:50:16,010 --> 00:50:21,110
a sense except for the hosting stuff

00:50:17,690 --> 00:50:23,000
yeah I think that yeah I do think that's

00:50:21,110 --> 00:50:25,400
going to be very hard unfortunately

00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:28,220
paying a subscription fee is something

00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:30,680
that I think again like that's an

00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:33,320
understood sort of mental model for you

00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:35,570
know the world people are willing to pay

00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:39,680
you know like 10 newspapers that's

00:50:35,570 --> 00:50:41,810
that's a great model I would go back to

00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:43,940
goals like how much do you realistically

00:50:41,810 --> 00:50:45,650
think you could you know if you were

00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:48,260
what I'm what I'm intuiting is like you

00:50:45,650 --> 00:50:50,120
made some modules for example that do

00:50:48,260 --> 00:50:51,800
some functionality like you'd like to

00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:53,540
have that be out there but you'd also

00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:57,190
like to charge for it is that kind of

00:50:53,540 --> 00:51:00,410
true yes I understand that right yeah so

00:50:57,190 --> 00:51:03,170
well GPL will you know you're gonna have

00:51:00,410 --> 00:51:06,320
intellectual property concerns there and

00:51:03,170 --> 00:51:07,760
I would season freely work that way

00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:10,970
though because they would be integrated

00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:13,580
the like rest api basically okay oh

00:51:10,970 --> 00:51:14,600
interesting all right well you might

00:51:13,580 --> 00:51:16,070
have something there again like you

00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:17,750
charge a subscription for something like

00:51:16,070 --> 00:51:19,880
that and open it up so that others can

00:51:17,750 --> 00:51:23,840
use it and such yeah something like a

00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:26,420
subscription for functionality is doable

00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:28,520
something like charging straight for the

00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:31,580
modules functionality the closer you are

00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:32,840
to that the the less likely it is the

00:51:31,580 --> 00:51:34,970
more likely i think that you'll anger

00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:38,240
people just you know you know make

00:51:34,970 --> 00:51:39,710
people unhappy and you know frankly not

00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:42,620
make as much as if you'd had some other

00:51:39,710 --> 00:51:45,470
solution and to be honest i don't think

00:51:42,620 --> 00:51:48,080
it would work but it would be awesome to

00:51:45,470 --> 00:51:52,520
hear you know mm-hmm if someone had

00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:55,760
succeeded in monetizing of you know kind

00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:56,830
of what they do in maybe not always such

00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:58,940
a good way in the WordPress community

00:51:56,830 --> 00:52:02,410
yeah right right right do you have a

00:51:58,940 --> 00:52:02,410
comment yet did answer

00:52:44,470 --> 00:52:50,840
interesting awesome cool thank you hi

00:52:47,750 --> 00:52:54,650
taco from go gorilla we're talking about

00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:56,330
WordPress plugins that are paid so what

00:52:54,650 --> 00:52:58,280
we did is we took the most popular

00:52:56,330 --> 00:53:02,480
WordPress module which is the Yoast SEO

00:52:58,280 --> 00:53:05,510
module 22 million installs and we're

00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:07,490
launching it tomorrow for Drupal so I

00:53:05,510 --> 00:53:10,220
think we'll see some more discussion

00:53:07,490 --> 00:53:12,680
about it will be a free module with all

00:53:10,220 --> 00:53:14,510
the features and then we will launch

00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:18,890
premium module which gives you gives you

00:53:14,510 --> 00:53:21,470
24 7 boards and so we really like to

00:53:18,890 --> 00:53:24,650
have a discussion about this because we

00:53:21,470 --> 00:53:27,500
feel that we invested 20k in this

00:53:24,650 --> 00:53:29,810
project we can only do this like make a

00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:31,670
really good SEO module helping Drupal

00:53:29,810 --> 00:53:34,040
helping all everybody here and all your

00:53:31,670 --> 00:53:36,200
clients if we also get some money back

00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:39,050
from this so so what I fear sometimes

00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:41,330
for for open sources that we don't have

00:53:39,050 --> 00:53:43,280
enough money to really do innovations or

00:53:41,330 --> 00:53:44,660
really build cool products so I'd really

00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:47,000
love to have a discussion about a

00:53:44,660 --> 00:53:50,120
premium module which is not limiting you

00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:52,040
in your features but it will give you

00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:54,410
support so you know if there's a bug or

00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:57,050
something you just can call Yost or us

00:53:54,410 --> 00:53:58,550
and we'll fix it for you so we would

00:53:57,050 --> 00:54:02,450
like to really experiment with bait

00:53:58,550 --> 00:54:04,910
modules in order to build better stuff

00:54:02,450 --> 00:54:05,960
for Drupal in the end and we're Google

00:54:04,910 --> 00:54:08,330
real life you have any feedback or

00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:10,460
discussions about this yeah we'd love to

00:54:08,330 --> 00:54:14,600
share these because yeah thanks for

00:54:10,460 --> 00:54:15,950
saying I think so yeah there's been a

00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:18,890
lot of conversations in that space

00:54:15,950 --> 00:54:20,870
obviously and that's a tricky one I

00:54:18,890 --> 00:54:22,460
think to the extent that you are having

00:54:20,870 --> 00:54:23,810
people pay for support that's again

00:54:22,460 --> 00:54:27,980
something that you people are used to

00:54:23,810 --> 00:54:29,630
that's a common model calling it a

00:54:27,980 --> 00:54:33,320
premium module would start I mean I

00:54:29,630 --> 00:54:35,570
think it gets a little bit to the

00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:38,090
slippery slope of oh i don't know like

00:54:35,570 --> 00:54:40,670
it's a service that you make available

00:54:38,090 --> 00:54:42,170
to people who subscribe or something

00:54:40,670 --> 00:54:46,340
like that but yeah that's a good thing

00:54:42,170 --> 00:54:50,240
yeah all right thanks yep any other

00:54:46,340 --> 00:54:52,930
questions all right well thank you all

00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:52,930
Oh nope

00:55:05,390 --> 00:55:08,290
