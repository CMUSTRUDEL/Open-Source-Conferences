Publication date: 2015-09-22
Playlist: DrupalCon Barcelona - September 2015
Description: 
	In this talk, I will explain the way that we use Docker in the DrupalCI test infrastructure.  I'll explain the basics of Docker, why it made sense to use it in DrupalCI, and how audience members can use Docker to help them as well.  Along the way I'll show specific examples of how to create Docker containers and how to troubleshoot applications within the container, all while showing real-world examples that are used in the Drupal infrastructure.
