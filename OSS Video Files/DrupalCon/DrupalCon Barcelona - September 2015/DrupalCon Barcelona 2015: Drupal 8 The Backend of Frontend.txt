Description: 
	This presentation outlines some of the major changes to the theme layer and why they were necessary to make a better experience for themers and module developers using Drupal 8. We will also walk through some of the internals of different aspects of the theme system and how they might affect your day-to-day work with Drupal.

Drupal 8 will ship with a fancy new template engine (Twig) and a simpler theme layer. In my session I’ll show you some goodies from Twig and walk through the changes it creates for developers.

Many parts of the presentation include best practices for working with the Drupal 7 theme layer which will give you knowledge that you can use right away.
