Title: DrupalCon Barcelona 2015: Serialization with Symfony: From J to O to X
Publication date: 2015-09-22
Playlist: DrupalCon Barcelona - September 2015
Description: 
	One of the key challenges for CMS today is that they do not just need to serve HTML with some pictures. Instead in a multi channel, multi app world, it is often necessary to support other data formats as well. With Drupal 8 the native support for JSON based REST interface will therefore see a much needed step up. This talk will introduce the Symfony Serialization component that is used by Drupal 8. While the component initially just covered very simple use cases it has grown over the course of the last year quite siginificantly to become quite a power house. Understanding what it can do will help both leverage as well as customize the REST support in Drupal 8.
