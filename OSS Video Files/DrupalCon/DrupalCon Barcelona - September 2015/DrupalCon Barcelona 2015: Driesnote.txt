cons that have changed in all that time

00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:09,960
in the last eight years and I wanted to

00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:13,049
hear about all the things that have been

00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:13,830
going on in Drupal since 2007 so I asked

00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:15,840
you on Twitter

00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:18,990
what's changed in the last eight years

00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:22,110
and when we learned is that the

00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:26,220
technology has changed 2007 first iPhone

00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:28,320

00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:31,110
that technology has changed missus food

00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:36,299
Reese's keynote in 2007 we suck at flash

00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:39,689
anyone concerned about that today no all

00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:41,880
right we also learned that some of the

00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:44,579
technology has not changed Larry

00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:47,340
Garfield reminded us but back in 2007 he

00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:52,920
was talking about the new php5 right

00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:56,070
here we are we also of course found out

00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:57,570
that our infrastructure like how we work

00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:59,149
together as a community has changed

00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:01,680
significantly in the last eight years

00:01:59,149 --> 00:02:04,290
back in 2007 if you wanted to test

00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,390
something in Drupal core you asked Angie

00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:09,899
and according to Angie she went poopy

00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:12,629
poopy poop and then it was tested but

00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:13,380
now we have all kinds of amazing Tesla's

00:02:12,629 --> 00:02:15,600

00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:31,650
about it so lots of people got to come

00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:35,460
out of their shells and become

00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:37,080

wind-borne but Aaron wind-borne was a

00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:19,440
prolific Drupal contributor and a really

00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:22,260

00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:33,450
and just this spring he passed away but

00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:36,060
he epitomized what makes Drupal so

00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:39,380
amazing I mean he was a great coder but

00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:41,330
what he really was was a fantastic human

00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:43,340
its contribution to the community that

00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:46,310
really inspired the community working

00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:59,150
represented the kind of ideals that

00:06:57,020 --> 00:07:01,610
Aaron represented these are some of the

00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:04,730

that you can do that the first here is

00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:42,570
as Jim mentioned earlier we're gonna

00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:44,730
have a group photo it's what we do at

00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:46,170
every con so after the Therese note

00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:48,120
today we're gonna ask you to exit out

00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:52,170
through these doors down the escalators

00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:53,970
and out into the courtyard area in front

00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:56,850
of registration where we'll take our

00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:58,290
group photo so head on outside soon

00:09:56,850 --> 00:10:00,720
after the keynote to make sure that that

00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:02,730
happens and then you can have fun trying

00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:05,880
to find yourself later a couple words

00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:08,850
about the Wi-Fi here here is the network

00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:10,380
and the password you may have noticed

00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:13,740
we've been having some trouble with the

00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:16,080
Wi-Fi so you know please be patient with

00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:18,030
us we have some outside network issues

00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:20,310
that are affecting what's happening

00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:22,290
inside the buildings so hold tight with

00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:25,200
us everyone's working on it if you do

00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:27,060
find that service is disconnecting

00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,820
anyone in a white t-shirt with the

00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:32,220
Barcelona logo on it is staff they can

00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:35,340
help alert folks and get the guy that

00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:37,440
week I we call Wi-Fi will to run over

00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:38,390
and see what we can do so we're working

00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,190
on it the best we can

00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:42,410
and we're really sorry for any

00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:43,490
disruptions that it causes but nobody

00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:46,510
has any live demos in their

00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:49,760
presentations right nobody did that okay

00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:52,910
all right after Wi-Fi you care about

00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:54,470
coffee so here's where to get it free

00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:56,210
coffee in the back of the exhibit hall

00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:58,280
will be available for the morning breaks

00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:59,960
that's right after our photo today and

00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:01,610
paid coffee will be available throughout

00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,900
the day back there in the exhibit hall

00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:06,320
so you can always go get a cup of coffee

00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:08,990
there your meals today will also be in

00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:12,260
that exhibit hall a couple of notes if

00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:14,380
you are if you have a special meal you

00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:18,170
have special stations for yourself there

00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:20,510
on the right-hand side of the buffet so

00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:23,090
if you are vegan kosher or halal lets

00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:24,800
you know where your things will be don't

00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:27,110
eat the vegan meals if you're not vegan

00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:29,390
because we don't want them to starve and

00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:31,700
if you have a kosher or halal meal do

00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:32,930
ask a waiter for your meal so that they

00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:34,030
can get that to you in the appropriate

00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:37,670
manner

00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:39,110
all right social media at the con lots

00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:40,370
of things here this is how to get

00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:44,270
connected and share what's happening

00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:46,670
with the outside world important for

00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:49,550
today in particular during 3 s's keynote

00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:50,540
the hashtag is Driss note that's also

00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:52,070
where you're going to want to send any

00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:54,830
questions so that the excellent my

00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:57,830
canelo can help feel those following the

00:11:54,830 --> 00:12:00,850
Driss note and the Q&A that we have all

00:11:57,830 --> 00:12:02,960
right couple of schedule changes today

00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:05,150
we have a change in the core

00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:07,550
conversations track so will now have

00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:10,310

for buffs if you were interested in

00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:20,300
scheduling a birds of a feather session

00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:21,800
that's off line now so you'll need to

00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:23,900
write that up on the boards in the

00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:28,640
hallway and there's still a little bit

00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:30,760

that done you know what Drupal claw 8 is

00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:41,280
closer than ever and we made a fancy

00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:46,110
game to celebrate the long long long

00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:48,870
march together you can see here a Drupal

00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:54,480
bird flying through the frozen versions

00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:59,580
of Drupal through the golden aid and

00:16:54,480 --> 00:17:01,470
beyond so if you want to play see

00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:05,760
whether you are worth of it you go to

00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:12,810
Drupal Burt calm and this is what it

00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:16,440
should look like so fly pass the frozen

00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:24,540
versions not hit them and then you get

00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:27,480
the golden eight and profit and

00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:37,860
yesterday when we had the first people

00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:40,830
understand it looked like this and and

00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:43,430
people were standing there with their

00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:43,430
mobile phones

00:17:52,130 --> 00:18:00,840
but you will master it by practicing I

00:17:56,220 --> 00:18:04,230
can guarantee that so when you have

00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:07,470
played come to our booth number 300 to

00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:10,409
claim your prize if you play the game

00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:12,149

00:18:10,409 --> 00:18:16,289
will be some of you you will get the

00:18:12,149 --> 00:18:19,590
great player sticker and then if you

00:18:16,289 --> 00:18:22,260
manage to get to the level eight or more

00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:26,460

to get this fancy t-shirt there will be

00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:07,649
only three of them we probably need to

00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:13,470
shred the others because we have some

00:19:07,649 --> 00:19:18,059

too much during the keynote that if the

00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:24,840
people are nodding they're looking bit

00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:28,159
angry then they are not agreeing with

00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:28,159
Greece but they are playing the game

00:19:29,899 --> 00:19:36,090
that's it now I'm going to introduce man

00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:38,250
that doesn't need introduct

00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:43,230
introductions is the reason why we are

00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:46,770
here the primary person behind group all

00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:49,520
and the man who's called six points in

00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:49,520
Rupa Bert

00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:57,920
please join me welcoming and rispa Dodd

00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:13,850
is my mic on it is so actually did try

00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:17,270
Drupal Bert's and I don't think I got

00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:20,180
past you know three so after this some

00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:23,570
more practicing all right welcome

00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:24,860
everybody to to Barcelona I did

00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:27,920
something a little bit special you saw

00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:29,750
me fiddle with my slides so normally I

00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:31,760
make my slides in keynote this time I

00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:35,150
made them in slights calm which is nice

00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:37,250
because it's HTML and CSS and JavaScript

00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:39,380
right and so you should be able to

00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:42,020
follow along on the you know if you go

00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:43,870
to this URL where those maybe not in the

00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:47,560
audience that are you know watching the

00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:52,400
videocast you can follow the slides

00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:56,720
alright so how many of you struggle with

00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:59,390
work-life balance I definitely do you

00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:01,430
know you remember those those days or

00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:04,130
those nights where you know you're

00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:07,160
working on a project for work or maybe

00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:09,560
you're working on Drupal 8 and in doing

00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:13,340
so you're kind of ignoring your partner

00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:15,680
you know he or she doesn't get the time

00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:18,200
the quality time that you know they

00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:20,780
deserve an overtime that starts to build

00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:22,430
up right and you know the tension in the

00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:25,370
back of your minds like you know it's

00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:29,180
gonna go wrong but you keep working on

00:21:25,370 --> 00:21:31,850
your project but at some point obviously

00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:36,290
you've crossed that threshold and he or

00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:42,140
she will basically be you know we need

00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:44,660
to talk let me get my clicker working

00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:47,360
here we need to talk and so you do talk

00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:50,960
about these things and once you're done

00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:53,870
talking it actually you know clear

00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:56,510
clears the air like you know you agree

00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:59,090
to make some changes and by implementing

00:21:56,510 --> 00:22:01,910
those changes you basically feel better

00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:03,740
you have a path forward and so I think

00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:07,220
this is just one example maybe an

00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:10,250
example that we can relate to but I do

00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:12,290
think it is true you know for many

00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:15,650
things in life and so sometimes it's

00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:16,820
better to actually talk about the things

00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:17,550
that are in the back of our minds

00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:19,800
instead

00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:21,300
not talking about them and so in this

00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:24,360
keynote I wanted to do something a

00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:26,760
little different and you know instead of

00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:28,890
talking about all the things that are

00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:31,470
great and all the great things we've

00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:33,720
done I wanted to talk about some of the

00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:35,730
things that part you know that keeps

00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:39,470
people up or that are in the back of

00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:43,320
people's minds and hopefully by doing so

00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:43,500
you know will feel better all right all

00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:47,310
right

00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:49,110
and so basically in talking to a lot of

00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:50,220
people and I do talk to a lot of people

00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:52,770
there's all these like sort of

00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:56,460
uncomfortable questions and so I made a

00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:59,550
list of those I think one that I think

00:22:56,460 --> 00:23:01,440
is on a lot of people's mind is you know

00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:04,620
what is you know it's drupal losing

00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:07,140
momentum you know some companies they're

00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:08,610
not doing as well as they used to do you

00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:12,210
know my phone isn't ringing off the hook

00:23:08,610 --> 00:23:15,990
anymore and so what's going on and so we

00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:18,330
need to talk about that you know why

00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:20,520
can't we release Drupal 8 on time you

00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:22,920
know it's been three years since we

00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:25,860
decided to start releasing Drupal 8 and

00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:30,120
we haven't released it yet maybe we

00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:32,280
should talk about that too a lot of

00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:34,440
people that I to talk to they're also

00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:36,120
nervous about other players in the

00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:38,250
market they'll say wow WordPress is

00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:40,710
growing so fast makes me a little

00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:43,320
nervous or you know Squarespace has

00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:46,560
evolved from maybe just an end-user tool

00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:47,750
to having better developer guys or so

00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:50,910
many of the large proprietary

00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:53,990
competitors have more features what are

00:23:50,910 --> 00:23:56,160
we doing there and what about the

00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:58,800
emerging new platforms that are

00:23:56,160 --> 00:24:02,040
basically focused on just providing AP

00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:04,560
ice right there's a series of these as

00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:07,590
well and so lots of questions that I get

00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:10,860
at least about how we as Drupal can

00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:16,440
compete in that market and so we need to

00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:17,370
talk about that as well the other thing

00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:22,470
is usability

00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:25,530
I think Angie has a presentation I think

00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:27,960
it's on Thursday about some of the

00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:29,950
results of the usability study that we

00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:31,929
did in Minnesota we do on

00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:34,000
you know on a regular basis I think this

00:24:31,929 --> 00:24:36,490
was the third version and there's still

00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:39,460
a lot of things basic things that people

00:24:36,490 --> 00:24:41,889
report to us and so why is it so hard to

00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:45,340
get some of these basic usability things

00:24:41,889 --> 00:24:51,669
right so we need to talk about that as

00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:55,929
well all right here's another one a lot

00:24:51,669 --> 00:24:57,490
of people that I talk to you know they

00:24:55,929 --> 00:25:01,330
look at these client-side apps

00:24:57,490 --> 00:25:03,789
backbone ember angularjs and they see

00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:06,190
them emerging maybe they're dabbling a

00:25:03,789 --> 00:25:08,769
little bit with maybe they feel like

00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:11,590
they're cheating on Drupal by doing that

00:25:08,769 --> 00:25:13,809
and so it's also a thing and you know I

00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:20,110
want to spend some time talking about

00:25:13,809 --> 00:25:21,970
that as well all right all right so all

00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:25,269
these questions I would like to address

00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:27,909
in this keynote at least is some depth

00:25:25,269 --> 00:25:29,320
and then I wrote a roughly organize them

00:25:27,909 --> 00:25:30,940
in these three buckets I think some of

00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:32,980
them are related to our development

00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:35,320
process some of them are related to our

00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:37,330
position in the market and some of them

00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:40,510
are more technical and you know about

00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:43,179
the relevance as a technical platform so

00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:46,269
let's talk about all of them and let's

00:25:43,179 --> 00:25:48,450
start with the first one because clearly

00:25:46,269 --> 00:25:51,549
we have a lot of things to talk about

00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:54,269
the first one is is Drupal losing

00:25:51,549 --> 00:25:57,789
momentum and I think the answer is yes

00:25:54,269 --> 00:25:59,889
we have lost a lot of momentum but in

00:25:57,789 --> 00:26:02,350
talking to a lot of people it's very

00:25:59,889 --> 00:26:05,440
clear that almost all of them are

00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:08,110
waiting for Drupal 8 right and in fact

00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:11,409
this is a known phenomenon this is not

00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:13,330
unusual there is in fact a name for this

00:26:11,409 --> 00:26:17,260
thing which is called the Osborne effect

00:26:13,330 --> 00:26:19,570
and the name actually came from I think

00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:22,059
his name was Adam Osborne and this was

00:26:19,570 --> 00:26:25,210
in the 80s he ran a technology company

00:26:22,059 --> 00:26:27,789
that was creating personal computers and

00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:30,309
so they had the Osborne one at the time

00:26:27,789 --> 00:26:33,909
and then they went on to announce the

00:26:30,309 --> 00:26:35,260
next version of the Osborne one and the

00:26:33,909 --> 00:26:37,720
fact that they announced that the next

00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:39,940
version of the Osborne one came when I

00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:42,910
was on the horizon basically stopped all

00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:47,560
sales and the company went bankrupt

00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:49,420
right and I think I think we also know

00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:51,400
it from maybe in their personal lives

00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:53,080
from you know buying a phone maybe it's

00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:54,340
an iPhone maybe it's another phone but

00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:57,820
if you know that there's gonna be a new

00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:59,860
iPhone in three months or in one one

00:26:57,820 --> 00:27:02,500
month you're not probably not gonna buy

00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:04,630
an iPhone and in fact Microsoft suffered

00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:06,070
from this as well and I think I don't

00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:08,380
know the exact details because I'm not a

00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:10,840
Microsoft user but they had a that is a

00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:13,120
really bad situation with this to wear

00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:17,320
that one version of the Windows Phone

00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:20,440
and not only was a new version coming

00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:22,330
out but also they said that the next

00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:25,120
version will not be compatible with the

00:27:22,330 --> 00:27:26,800
previous version and so it made it even

00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:29,350
worse that it couldn't actually just

00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:30,910
upgrade the software and so this is

00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:33,550
exactly what's happening with Drupal as

00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:36,730
well and this has happened in the past

00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:38,200
to made maybe it's been so long ago that

00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:43,300
we don't remember but if you look at

00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:45,940
what happened with Drupal 6 roughly you

00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:48,820
know six months or more before Drupal 7

00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:51,880
was released we saw a real drop a 30%

00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:56,140
drop almost in adoption so we've seen is

00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:58,750
before but what we've also seen is that

00:27:56,140 --> 00:28:02,560
once that major release comes out there

00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:04,660
is a huge spike and so I'm very

00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:06,940
confident that we will see a similar

00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:10,060
spike once Drupal 8 comes out and

00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:11,650
historically you know Drupal adoption

00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:15,130
has roughly doubled with every major

00:28:11,650 --> 00:28:18,160
release and so yes maybe we're losing

00:28:15,130 --> 00:28:20,920
some business right now because our

00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:23,470
customers our users are waiting for

00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:25,930
Drupal 8 but once we get Drupal 8

00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:30,010
released you should expect things to

00:28:25,930 --> 00:28:31,900
pick up very rapidly and so what we

00:28:30,010 --> 00:28:34,840
really have to do here is get Drupal 8

00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:37,390
released I mean of course that isn't

00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:38,890
anything new but there's a lot of

00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:41,770
different ways to help you can donate

00:28:38,890 --> 00:28:45,400
money you know thank you for pushing us

00:28:41,770 --> 00:28:47,910
over that uh you know that limits or not

00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:50,200
limits but that a goal

00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:51,760
but I think the most important thing you

00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:55,720
can do actually today is to start

00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:57,490
building our websites on Drupal 8 even

00:28:55,720 --> 00:29:00,520
though we haven't released April 8 yet

00:28:57,490 --> 00:29:02,950
for a certain type of project you can

00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:05,560
start building today projects that don't

00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:08,770
need contribute modules projects that

00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:10,180
won't release yes you don't have to run

00:29:08,770 --> 00:29:12,040
them in production quite yet some of

00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:14,470
these projects take a few months to

00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:18,250
develop and it's pretty safe to do the

00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:20,050
development on Drupal 8 not saying you

00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:21,940
should run them in production but you

00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:24,310
can start building them in Drupal 8 and

00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:27,220
in building them you find critical bugs

00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:28,690
you can help port modules and do all of

00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:36,100
these things and this is what will help

00:29:28,690 --> 00:29:38,350
the ecosystem advance alright so we've

00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:40,510
actually come a pretty long way

00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:42,520
Holly already shared some of these

00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:45,310
statistics but if you look at the

00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:47,170
history of Drupal 8 we accepted patches

00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:49,360
from more than 3,000 different

00:29:47,170 --> 00:29:51,300
contributors that's a lot of people

00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:55,720
that's more people than are in this room

00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:59,470
right and in fact we accepted over

00:29:55,720 --> 00:30:03,010
15,000 patches last year in Amsterdam

00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:06,100
that number was around 11,000 so in just

00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:08,950
one year we've added you know we've

00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:11,140
accepted more than 4,000 new patches we

00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:14,710
fixed a thousand three hundred criticals

00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:18,430
in the process that's that's a big

00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:21,100
number too and probably the most

00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:23,980
exciting two stats are that the two at

00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:27,760
the bottom so for one month we've not

00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:30,040
seen any surprises you know when we

00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:33,010
manage the criticals you know to release

00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:35,410
blocker the release blocking bugs we

00:30:33,010 --> 00:30:37,300
haven't seen anything that surprised us

00:30:35,410 --> 00:30:38,920
in a month and what that means is that

00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:40,480
you know we're getting more and more

00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:43,780
stable and that things are getting more

00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:47,320
and more predictable and also there's

00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:48,580
only one real problem left so if you if

00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:50,620
you actually go to the critical issue

00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:53,770
queue you may actually get a different

00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:55,690
perception because you may remember that

00:30:53,770 --> 00:30:58,420
a week or two weeks ago we hit an

00:30:55,690 --> 00:30:59,610
all-time low of three remaining critical

00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:02,210
bugs and if

00:30:59,610 --> 00:31:03,720
- look today it's probably at 18 or 19

00:31:02,210 --> 00:31:05,970
critical bucks

00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:08,340
it's a little bit misleading because

00:31:05,970 --> 00:31:10,559
what we've done is we've taken one of

00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:13,170
those critical bugs and we split it out

00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:16,049
in smaller critical bugs so the total

00:31:13,170 --> 00:31:18,780
amount of work is actually the same just

00:31:16,049 --> 00:31:20,640
that the way we choose to organize it is

00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:22,350
in making smaller critical bugs for

00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:24,480
everything that was in that one critical

00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:27,990
bug and so really we've never been

00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:32,220
closer to to release and we've never

00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:34,620
felt better about the kind of bugs that

00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:39,059
come in and they get reported and so as

00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:41,370
a result we've decided to make a first

00:31:39,059 --> 00:31:43,730
release candidate available on October

00:31:41,370 --> 00:31:43,730
7th

00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:55,550
I think that's very exciting the caveat

00:31:52,970 --> 00:31:57,830
though is that you know while we feel

00:31:55,550 --> 00:31:59,570
really good about the bugs that come in

00:31:57,830 --> 00:32:02,120
and the fact that there's no surprise

00:31:59,570 --> 00:32:04,820
criticals you know of course you never

00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:07,280
know and we may find the security bug or

00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:11,060
a severe data loss issue that would

00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:12,950
cause a change in in this in this state

00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:15,410
that we haven't found any of those in

00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:17,450
one month so we're feeling pretty good

00:32:15,410 --> 00:32:21,740
about not finding anymore

00:32:17,450 --> 00:32:22,550
but you never know so I think that's

00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:25,040
exciting

00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:28,820
it means we're only about two weeks away

00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:30,980
I think from having the first RC and

00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:36,560
we're going into that with a lot of

00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:40,160
stability so however you know some

00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:42,340
things sort of need to change to write

00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:47,030
it the process to get there was

00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:49,340
incredibly hard in fact it took us

00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:51,740
almost three years since we first

00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:56,630
announced feature freeze to where we are

00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:59,420
today last year an Amsterdam we rolled

00:32:56,630 --> 00:33:02,660
the first beta now a year later we're

00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:05,050
still not are at our C and in fact if

00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:09,200
you think about Drupal is 15 years old

00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:12,020
almost almost 15 years old in almost 5

00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:15,020
years of Drupal's life we've spent on

00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:17,600
Drupal 8 it's kind of crazy you know

00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:21,380
it's a third of our life we've spent on

00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:24,370
working on Drupal 8 so it's not very

00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:29,950
healthy for a release to take that long

00:33:24,370 --> 00:33:32,120
so so why can't we release some time

00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:34,580
first of all I want to say that no one

00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:38,540
is to blame for this you know I think

00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:41,450
it's not because we don't work hard it's

00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:43,160
not because we're not smart in fact I

00:33:41,450 --> 00:33:46,670
think Drupal is one of the hardest

00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:49,010
working and smartest people that I've

00:33:46,670 --> 00:33:52,940
ever seen and you know many people have

00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:55,070
worked days and nights and weekends and

00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:55,610
probably gave up a lot of that work-life

00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:57,740
balance

00:33:55,610 --> 00:34:02,030
you know travels around the world even

00:33:57,740 --> 00:34:03,350
to get Drupal 8 released and so a lot of

00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:05,330
people have done in credit

00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:08,630
things so no one is to blame for this

00:34:05,330 --> 00:34:10,670
except you know maybe me for not seeing

00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:15,830
this problem earlier for not making some

00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:19,040
changes earlier but I think the lesson

00:34:15,830 --> 00:34:21,290
here is that you know it's not about

00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:23,360
people it's not about us it's really

00:34:21,290 --> 00:34:26,390
about the process we've we've been

00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:28,040
working the wrong way and so here's I

00:34:26,390 --> 00:34:29,540
would like to explain how we've worked

00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:29,960
so if you think about how we think about

00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:33,290
it

00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:35,510
building a feature in Drupal we roughly

00:34:33,290 --> 00:34:38,120
plan it out we say this feature we're

00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:39,860
gonna split in smaller steps you know

00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:42,260
each of these steps is gonna be patch

00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:44,240
that patch is gonna get committed and we

00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:47,180
do that in seven steps or four steps or

00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:49,220
however many steps but in a reality as

00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:51,770
you all know things work a little bit

00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:53,780
different each of these steps takes

00:34:51,770 --> 00:34:55,640
maybe a little bit longer there is

00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:58,370
things that we didn't predict that need

00:34:55,640 --> 00:35:00,380
to happen as well sometimes people

00:34:58,370 --> 00:35:03,650
disappear you know things happen in

00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:05,900
their life they lose interest they have

00:35:03,650 --> 00:35:08,480
to focus on something else did they move

00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:10,790
away from Drupal either permanently or

00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:12,710
temporarily and so the work is done left

00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:14,270
behind and we lose a lot of time when

00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:16,520
that happens because then somebody else

00:35:14,270 --> 00:35:20,510
needs to step in and pick up that work

00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:21,920
and so reality always takes a little bit

00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:23,690
longer and you know this is nothing new

00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:26,510
I think a lot of us in their daily lives

00:35:23,690 --> 00:35:28,910
working for agencies you know we see it

00:35:26,510 --> 00:35:31,310
as planning is really hard and humans

00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:33,830
are actually really bad at any kind of

00:35:31,310 --> 00:35:36,950
planning and so it's called the planning

00:35:33,830 --> 00:35:38,960
fallacy you can go read about it but I

00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:40,430
think my theis mike tyson put it really

00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:43,280
well

00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:46,160
everyone has a plan until they get

00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:47,780
punched in the mouth and so that's

00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:50,120
exactly what happens with every feature

00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:52,580
that we put in Drupal there's a lot of

00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:56,030
ways we can stumble and we do so now I

00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:57,770
multiply this by many features right

00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:59,210
because at any given time we're working

00:35:57,770 --> 00:36:04,100
on many of these features at the same

00:35:59,210 --> 00:36:04,630
time plus we do all of that in a single

00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:07,280
branch

00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:09,410
it's called trunk base development or

00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:12,860
all of these patches get committed to to

00:36:09,410 --> 00:36:15,150
the main branch the trunk and so what

00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:18,579
happens with this process is

00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:21,039
that you know when we said a release

00:36:18,579 --> 00:36:24,789
date which we've done multiple times or

00:36:21,039 --> 00:36:27,279
you know milestones I should say when

00:36:24,789 --> 00:36:28,990
all the features aren't ready we can't

00:36:27,279 --> 00:36:32,349
meet that milestone and so we have to

00:36:28,990 --> 00:36:33,880
move the milestone right and so really

00:36:32,349 --> 00:36:37,900
what that means is we can only go as

00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:39,700
fast as our slowest feature which

00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:41,349
obviously isn't great and so now imagine

00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:44,470
what we did in Drupal 8 we added

00:36:41,349 --> 00:36:47,230
hundreds of features so if hundreds of

00:36:44,470 --> 00:36:49,539
these you know timelines that we're

00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:52,779
trying to get to a finish line and all

00:36:49,539 --> 00:36:54,819
of these are going you know slower than

00:36:52,779 --> 00:36:57,670
expected or most of them go slower than

00:36:54,819 --> 00:36:59,619
expected and we need to get all hundreds

00:36:57,670 --> 00:37:02,260
or 200 of these over the finish line

00:36:59,619 --> 00:37:05,440
before we can release it's kind of a bad

00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:07,180
situation and in fact you know that's

00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:10,420
exactly what we did and now we're down

00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:12,010
to just one feature which is tweak and

00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:14,650
all of these criticals that I mentioned

00:37:12,010 --> 00:37:17,319
they basically come down to you know

00:37:14,650 --> 00:37:17,950
twig and twig I to escaping and save

00:37:17,319 --> 00:37:19,990
markup

00:37:17,950 --> 00:37:21,579
so we're literally down to the like

00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:23,410
getting the last feature over the finish

00:37:21,579 --> 00:37:26,640
line which is which is quite exciting

00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:29,259
but we really have to stop doing this

00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:31,660
you know like if we if we don't change

00:37:29,259 --> 00:37:34,269
the way we work we will literally kill

00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:36,490
ourselves not just individual strength

00:37:34,269 --> 00:37:39,670
to push Drupal over the finish line but

00:37:36,490 --> 00:37:42,720
the momentum and the innovation coming

00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:46,990
out of the project will will be too slow

00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:49,589
and so I'd like to propose and adjust a

00:37:46,990 --> 00:37:52,720
starting point for a bigger discussion

00:37:49,589 --> 00:37:56,039
is that we change the way we work now we

00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:59,049
built that we use a methodology that

00:37:56,039 --> 00:38:01,049
accepts the reality which is humans are

00:37:59,049 --> 00:38:04,390
really bad at planning things happen

00:38:01,049 --> 00:38:07,150
it's a complex world but that we figure

00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:10,000
out a way to to do what we do or to do

00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:11,680
what we have to do in a way that kind of

00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,630
takes that into account and in fact

00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:17,319
there is a you know other projects use a

00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:21,420
system that lends itself better to that

00:38:17,319 --> 00:38:23,589
and so what they do is they move

00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:26,140
basically create feature branches for

00:38:23,589 --> 00:38:27,010
each of the features and so what you do

00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:28,630
is

00:38:27,010 --> 00:38:30,730
for big features who built them in a

00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:34,900
feature branch and only when the feature

00:38:30,730 --> 00:38:39,609
is shippable you merge it into the main

00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:42,010
branch right and so they're really firm

00:38:39,609 --> 00:38:44,440
on keeping the main branch shippable we

00:38:42,010 --> 00:38:47,440
cannot commit patches that require

00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:49,830
follow-up to the main branch because we

00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:52,359
never get the amount of follow-up right

00:38:49,830 --> 00:38:54,760
and so by developing each of the

00:38:52,359 --> 00:38:57,820
features in a feature branch and only

00:38:54,760 --> 00:39:02,460
merging when they're shippable we can

00:38:57,820 --> 00:39:05,109
get to a much more shippable main branch

00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:08,230
that doesn't mean we can no longer use

00:39:05,109 --> 00:39:10,480
our patch based workflow now people can

00:39:08,230 --> 00:39:12,970
still submit patches to a feature branch

00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:16,480
and feature branches can still accept

00:39:12,970 --> 00:39:18,369
multiple patches right we can still do

00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:20,380
the development the way we used to do it

00:39:18,369 --> 00:39:22,570
the only difference is that we'll have

00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:25,540
to merge a feature branch in the main

00:39:22,570 --> 00:39:27,580
branch whenever we feel it is shippable

00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:31,750
and by shippable I mean we would make a

00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:33,460
release you know with that stuff in like

00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:35,369
we wouldn't say well we have to do these

00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:39,070
other things before we can release all

00:39:35,369 --> 00:39:43,150
right and so what that allows us to do

00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:45,490
is to switch to a date based system or

00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:48,520
time-based releases or something that is

00:39:45,490 --> 00:39:50,770
much closer to that and so the way it

00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:54,280
works is if the feature is shippable we

00:39:50,770 --> 00:39:56,140
merge it in if a feature isn't ready we

00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:58,330
can still release when the feature can

00:39:56,140 --> 00:40:02,470
go into the next version of Drupal or

00:39:58,330 --> 00:40:05,800
maybe the version after that pretty

00:40:02,470 --> 00:40:07,780
simple I think or at least it sounds

00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:10,480
simple but the complexity is in now we

00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:12,010
have to manage these you know merges and

00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:13,750
it's you know pretty complex sometimes

00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:16,900
if you have all these feature branches

00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:20,140
and merges merges become kind of a mess

00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:23,290
but I think it's still much better than

00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:25,030
having to work for three years on fixing

00:40:23,290 --> 00:40:28,330
all of the bugs like even if a merge

00:40:25,030 --> 00:40:30,910
takes is three weeks even if a merge

00:40:28,330 --> 00:40:34,060
takes is six weeks it's still better

00:40:30,910 --> 00:40:36,700
than working for three years on fixing

00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:39,220
all the bugs right and there's also

00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:40,450
things we can do to make it a bit easier

00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:44,070
like we can still break

00:40:40,450 --> 00:40:46,720
got features we can break him up in MVPs

00:40:44,070 --> 00:40:48,990
again at the end of an MVP we could

00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:51,250
merge it in and we could ship it right

00:40:48,990 --> 00:40:54,190
even if it doesn't mean the feature is

00:40:51,250 --> 00:40:56,200
complete it would still be a good idea I

00:40:54,190 --> 00:40:59,410
think the other thing we've learned is

00:40:56,200 --> 00:41:02,320
that you know with the initiatives in

00:40:59,410 --> 00:41:04,329
Drupal 8 is that the best initiatives

00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:08,440
we're the ones with a cross-functional

00:41:04,329 --> 00:41:11,250
team and so I'd love to see a lot of

00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:14,380
these features of cross-functional teams

00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:16,270
because they get the best velocity but

00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:19,180
they also get the consistency if one

00:41:16,270 --> 00:41:20,890
person you know can no longer contribute

00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:23,710
because something changed in his or her

00:41:20,890 --> 00:41:26,589
life and the rest of the team can you

00:41:23,710 --> 00:41:28,960
know carry on with the work and all that

00:41:26,589 --> 00:41:31,359
she's being shared so really encouraged

00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:34,390
us to think about how we can you know

00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:36,250
embrace the notion of teams more and

00:41:34,390 --> 00:41:37,780
then I think the role of the the

00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:40,900
technical leadership of the core

00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:43,000
committers will basically you know be

00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:45,520
what they do today review patches commit

00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:49,869
patches to feature branches but it will

00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:52,270
also be about orchestrating merges like

00:41:49,869 --> 00:41:53,920
even if something is ready we may not

00:41:52,270 --> 00:41:56,380
choose to merge it yet because they want

00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:59,230
something else to be ready first and and

00:41:56,380 --> 00:42:01,720
to get that merged in you know before

00:41:59,230 --> 00:42:03,849
the way we would do it is based on fir

00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:05,710
on the one hand we want to maximize the

00:42:03,849 --> 00:42:07,810
impact on the project in the next

00:42:05,710 --> 00:42:10,569
release you want to merge in great

00:42:07,810 --> 00:42:12,430
features on the other hand we want to

00:42:10,569 --> 00:42:14,890
minimize the impact of a merge on the

00:42:12,430 --> 00:42:17,170
developers right because if you merge a

00:42:14,890 --> 00:42:20,470
feature all of the other feature

00:42:17,170 --> 00:42:22,420
branches may have to be updated and so

00:42:20,470 --> 00:42:24,520
we'll have to get really good at that

00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:27,069
and you know left to learn a lot about

00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:29,530
how that will work for us but I think by

00:42:27,069 --> 00:42:33,510
doing this I think we'll be in a much

00:42:29,530 --> 00:42:35,859
better place so to sum up this section

00:42:33,510 --> 00:42:38,560
you know we didn't really some time in

00:42:35,859 --> 00:42:40,569
fact there you know many years leads but

00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:43,030
it wasn't our fault I really don't think

00:42:40,569 --> 00:42:45,910
it was any individuals fault it was

00:42:43,030 --> 00:42:48,880
really the way we worked and I think

00:42:45,910 --> 00:42:51,940
we're gonna fix the way we work a lot of

00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:54,040
details to figure out but ideally we

00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:54,850
would never see this happen again we

00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:57,790
would have regular

00:42:54,850 --> 00:43:02,590
releases and regular innovation coming

00:42:57,790 --> 00:43:04,780
out of the projects all right so is the

00:43:02,590 --> 00:43:08,520
first part of some of the first

00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:11,650
questions on the market position

00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:14,380
you know people wonder you know can we

00:43:11,650 --> 00:43:16,900
compete and typically I think sort of

00:43:14,380 --> 00:43:18,940
the the elephant in the room that I hear

00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:21,700
when I talk to people is WordPress you

00:43:18,940 --> 00:43:23,560
know they're growing fast they're moving

00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:25,360
up the stack they're adding new features

00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:28,990
like they're dabbling with things like

00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:30,250
filled UI and stuff like that and so in

00:43:28,990 --> 00:43:33,190
people's minds the work looks a little

00:43:30,250 --> 00:43:33,910
bit like this right we're pressed being

00:43:33,190 --> 00:43:36,820
huge

00:43:33,910 --> 00:43:38,500
you know Joomla being bigger than Drupal

00:43:36,820 --> 00:43:40,750
and in Drupal being the smallest of the

00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:44,080
three but I also think we have to move

00:43:40,750 --> 00:43:45,670
on from that because the reality I think

00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:48,310
looks a little bit more like this where

00:43:45,670 --> 00:43:51,070
Drupal is the dominant platform for

00:43:48,310 --> 00:43:53,290
large and complex websites you know

00:43:51,070 --> 00:43:55,870
Drupal is more powerful for those sites

00:43:53,290 --> 00:43:58,540
the things we have our ability to scale

00:43:55,870 --> 00:44:01,480
the content modeling tools that we have

00:43:58,540 --> 00:44:04,090
WordPress doesn't have those they're

00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:05,860
starting to build those but we are like

00:44:04,090 --> 00:44:12,250
literally years and years ahead of them

00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:15,100
and that's reflected in you know uh you

00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:18,550
know in the adoption of Drupal obviously

00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:20,680
WordPress is very big on the lower end

00:44:18,550 --> 00:44:23,680
of the market and there's definitely

00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:27,070
things we can learn from them right I

00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:29,830
think the key is first thing to remember

00:44:27,070 --> 00:44:31,300
is I don't think it's you know I think

00:44:29,830 --> 00:44:32,980
we have to stop comparing Drupal to

00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:35,710
WordPress because we're so vastly

00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:39,100
different you know we serve different

00:44:35,710 --> 00:44:41,650
audiences or focused on a different size

00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:45,100
of the markets but what we can learn

00:44:41,650 --> 00:44:46,780
from them is that you know WordPress has

00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:49,240
done a great job focusing on the

00:44:46,780 --> 00:44:53,170
usability of the author but also the

00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:57,280
site builder and we Drupal we've done a

00:44:53,170 --> 00:44:59,310
great job focusing on the developer like

00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:02,620
we've been really focused on a developer

00:44:59,310 --> 00:45:05,380
and for a long time if we've tried to

00:45:02,620 --> 00:45:07,900
change that actually if you go back to

00:45:05,380 --> 00:45:08,359
my Drupal con Barcelona slide in 2007

00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:10,400
that's eight

00:45:08,359 --> 00:45:14,420
years ago what I did is I did this

00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:15,980
survey and asked every you know

00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:17,720
everybody that wanted to fill out the

00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:19,430
survey what do you think we should put

00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:22,220
in the next version of Drupal and at the

00:45:19,430 --> 00:45:24,739
time there was Ripple seven and so I

00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:27,170
looked at all that survey data and out

00:45:24,739 --> 00:45:29,180
of that came this notion of the Drupal 7

00:45:27,170 --> 00:45:31,940
killer release like well would be the

00:45:29,180 --> 00:45:34,069
ultimate release and so it looked a

00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:35,900
little bit like this and I suggested at

00:45:34,069 --> 00:45:39,049
the time though it would spend 70% of

00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:42,999
our efforts on things related to user

00:45:39,049 --> 00:45:46,910
experience site builders and only 30%

00:45:42,999 --> 00:45:48,650
focused on the developer experience and

00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:50,059
so funny enough today we've actually

00:45:48,650 --> 00:45:51,259
done all of these things it took us

00:45:50,059 --> 00:45:54,859
eight years but most of these things

00:45:51,259 --> 00:45:57,259
we've never done we've put custom

00:45:54,859 --> 00:46:00,049
content types in corby Drupal 8 will

00:45:57,259 --> 00:46:02,710
have a WYSIWYG some of the work and big

00:46:00,049 --> 00:46:05,900
pipe will give us great performance

00:46:02,710 --> 00:46:07,400
views is in core but then also for the

00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:09,319
developer stuff we've also done these

00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:12,859
things so took us eight years but we

00:46:09,319 --> 00:46:14,809
finally reached this killer idea with

00:46:12,859 --> 00:46:16,549
Drupal 7 and one of the things actually

00:46:14,809 --> 00:46:19,759
did in Barcelona it's not on this slide

00:46:16,549 --> 00:46:24,289
added you know forced in another item

00:46:19,759 --> 00:46:25,700
which is 11 which user experience but

00:46:24,289 --> 00:46:27,410
really what we've done is we've done all

00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:30,680
of these things but then we've done all

00:46:27,410 --> 00:46:32,660
of these other things as well and most

00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:34,039
of it is for developers widget which is

00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:38,089
great

00:46:34,039 --> 00:46:40,220
but how can we get better at you know

00:46:38,089 --> 00:46:42,589
getting the use of the user experience

00:46:40,220 --> 00:46:45,710
right and I think you really have to

00:46:42,589 --> 00:46:48,499
start thinking about Drupal as not just

00:46:45,710 --> 00:46:51,680
as a tool for us developers but as a

00:46:48,499 --> 00:46:54,220
tool for site builders a tool for

00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:56,989
authors and we need to spend more time

00:46:54,220 --> 00:47:00,739
you know focusing on these kinds of

00:46:56,989 --> 00:47:02,539
features and it's not just a list of

00:47:00,739 --> 00:47:04,400
features like I had on the slide no in

00:47:02,539 --> 00:47:06,609
fact we have a lot of these features

00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:09,529
it's about making experience better

00:47:06,609 --> 00:47:12,049
making it very easy and seamless for

00:47:09,529 --> 00:47:15,170
people to use and I think the field UI

00:47:12,049 --> 00:47:16,630
is a great example of that you know we

00:47:15,170 --> 00:47:20,029
have all these great features that give

00:47:16,630 --> 00:47:21,650
incredible power to to our users into

00:47:20,029 --> 00:47:22,170
our site builders they're just too hard

00:47:21,650 --> 00:47:24,360
to use

00:47:22,170 --> 00:47:26,970
thanks and that was very clear coming

00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:29,220
out of the usability testing so

00:47:26,970 --> 00:47:31,650
encourage you to go you know watch ng

00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:36,930
session on that where she will share the

00:47:31,650 --> 00:47:39,000
results so then how do we how do we do

00:47:36,930 --> 00:47:40,890
that and you know I think it's it's

00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:42,780
another process thing you know we have

00:47:40,890 --> 00:47:44,460
to let them try it and so instead of

00:47:42,780 --> 00:47:46,830
working like this we should really

00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:48,480
consider embracing a lot of the best

00:47:46,830 --> 00:47:51,210
practices that have been around for many

00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:53,730
years which is involving these users in

00:47:51,210 --> 00:47:56,820
the development process and by you know

00:47:53,730 --> 00:47:58,800
paper testing making prototypes doing

00:47:56,820 --> 00:48:01,920
some user testing along the way instead

00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:04,650
of too often we wait until everything is

00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:07,760
complete to go test it you know we did

00:48:04,650 --> 00:48:09,960
this with you know block management and

00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:11,310
you know we build all of these things

00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:13,020
and then we learned that you know it's

00:48:11,310 --> 00:48:17,460
not actually usable and if they go

00:48:13,020 --> 00:48:20,040
rebuild it and so we can learn from that

00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:21,990
and I really think we should I didn't

00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:24,170
believe if we do that we can go after

00:48:21,990 --> 00:48:26,750
the real opportunity which is in fact

00:48:24,170 --> 00:48:30,180
80% of the world does not use a CMS

00:48:26,750 --> 00:48:33,330
there's all this white space you know we

00:48:30,180 --> 00:48:35,310
worry about competitors but really the

00:48:33,330 --> 00:48:38,760
opportunity is to go after all of these

00:48:35,310 --> 00:48:40,950
sites that don't use a CMS at all so we

00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:43,380
need to convince these people these

00:48:40,950 --> 00:48:46,950
organizations that Drupal is the right

00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:48,720
tool for them so to sum this up but

00:48:46,950 --> 00:48:50,970
actually do believe Drupal is in a very

00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:53,160
strong position I think we have some of

00:48:50,970 --> 00:48:55,260
the best content modeling tools I think

00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:56,790
we have some of the best page building

00:48:55,260 --> 00:48:59,580
tools although they're a little hard to

00:48:56,790 --> 00:49:01,830
use I think we have some of the best

00:48:59,580 --> 00:49:03,840
developer experience especially with the

00:49:01,830 --> 00:49:08,130
stuff we did in Drupal 8 and it's way

00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:10,320
better than WordPress it really is but

00:49:08,130 --> 00:49:12,620
we can still learn from WordPress about

00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:15,210
how to make the user experience better

00:49:12,620 --> 00:49:18,420
so and also let's not just focus on

00:49:15,210 --> 00:49:20,700
WordPress because I think you know as

00:49:18,420 --> 00:49:23,250
you saw in the graph things like Adobe

00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:28,960
cq5 they're you know quickly coming up

00:49:23,250 --> 00:49:31,150
and getting bigger as well all right so

00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:34,800
the third part of the keynote I want to

00:49:31,150 --> 00:49:37,869
talk a little bit about the technical

00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:40,559
relevance of Drupal and you know what

00:49:37,869 --> 00:49:40,559
are these frameworks

00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:47,619
the JavaScript MVC frameworks or the

00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:50,200
client-side apps and I should we react

00:49:47,619 --> 00:49:53,020
to them how should we think about them a

00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:54,940
lot of people ask me so imagine it it's

00:49:53,020 --> 00:49:57,280
on a lot of people's mind and it is

00:49:54,940 --> 00:49:59,200
because you know decouple Drupal or

00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:01,180
headless Drupal this is one of them

00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:06,520
probably one of the biggest trends or

00:50:01,180 --> 00:50:08,710
you know how to stop exceed assess all

00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:10,119
right so there are big trends I don't

00:50:08,710 --> 00:50:12,849
think the trend will be will be going

00:50:10,119 --> 00:50:15,099
away I think it's here to stay so we

00:50:12,849 --> 00:50:17,380
need to you know we need to adopt

00:50:15,099 --> 00:50:19,359
accordingly before I go there not

00:50:17,380 --> 00:50:22,150
everybody may be familiar with these so

00:50:19,359 --> 00:50:25,420
try to explain it very quickly what's

00:50:22,150 --> 00:50:28,480
been happening so in the early early

00:50:25,420 --> 00:50:34,359
days of the web the way people built

00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:37,240
websites is by writing HTML and it would

00:50:34,359 --> 00:50:39,430
write HTML in a browser in a in notepad

00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:41,859
or something and then upload it to the

00:50:39,430 --> 00:50:44,260
server the server would serve it to the

00:50:41,859 --> 00:50:47,049
client to the browser right and so their

00:50:44,260 --> 00:50:49,510
rendering literally happens with

00:50:47,049 --> 00:50:51,040
somebody's hands they would create a

00:50:49,510 --> 00:50:52,839
layer I would put the content in there

00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:55,599
you know all of these things and just

00:50:52,839 --> 00:50:57,819
upload it CMS's came along and really

00:50:55,599 --> 00:51:00,190
what changed that their rendering kind

00:50:57,819 --> 00:51:04,510
of moved from the desktop to the server

00:51:00,190 --> 00:51:06,309
so now people would provide content to

00:51:04,510 --> 00:51:08,200
the server you know to a user interface

00:51:06,309 --> 00:51:11,369
but they would not write HTML they would

00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:14,589
write content and the server or the CMS

00:51:11,369 --> 00:51:16,240
would you know build the layout put that

00:51:14,589 --> 00:51:18,549
content in there and send it to the

00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:20,470
clients I think we're all very familiar

00:51:18,549 --> 00:51:23,470
with that model because that's

00:51:20,470 --> 00:51:25,599
effectively what you brought us so then

00:51:23,470 --> 00:51:28,089
now with these client-side apps the

00:51:25,599 --> 00:51:31,270
rendering kind of moved one step further

00:51:28,089 --> 00:51:33,609
right so now it's the the browser the

00:51:31,270 --> 00:51:35,950
app that's basically building the layout

00:51:33,609 --> 00:51:38,920
and it's requesting content from the

00:51:35,950 --> 00:51:42,220
server could be a MongoDB database and

00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:43,869
so they do some restate guys

00:51:42,220 --> 00:51:47,440
to get the content but the browser will

00:51:43,869 --> 00:51:49,960
all put it into a layout you know and

00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:53,580
push it to them and present it to the to

00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:55,599
the client if you will all right so I

00:51:53,580 --> 00:51:57,460
know this is actually very good because

00:51:55,599 --> 00:51:59,380
there's a lot of advantages to this

00:51:57,460 --> 00:52:01,390
model by pushing the rendering to the

00:51:59,380 --> 00:52:03,730
clients there's a couple of things you

00:52:01,390 --> 00:52:06,010
can do more easily and one of them is

00:52:03,730 --> 00:52:09,670
called optimistic feedback which you can

00:52:06,010 --> 00:52:12,700
see on this slide which this is a

00:52:09,670 --> 00:52:14,890
screenshot of Pinterest and so you can

00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:17,230
see the kind of sent the layouts and

00:52:14,890 --> 00:52:18,880
sort of the blocks ahead of time and

00:52:17,230 --> 00:52:20,080
then the images are filled in in a

00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:21,760
second step and they're actually quite

00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:24,730
smart about it because they can assemble

00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:27,550
the pixels and they come up with a kind

00:52:24,730 --> 00:52:30,099
of average color of the image all right

00:52:27,550 --> 00:52:32,710
that's a detail but the idea of

00:52:30,099 --> 00:52:34,570
optimistic feedback is is that it's you

00:52:32,710 --> 00:52:36,340
know it's a better experience it's a

00:52:34,570 --> 00:52:40,750
faster experience it's perceived

00:52:36,340 --> 00:52:44,320
performance for the for the for the

00:52:40,750 --> 00:52:46,300
visitor of the website another example

00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:48,540
is non-blocking user interfaces and this

00:52:46,300 --> 00:52:51,040
is a screenshot of my facebook page

00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:53,230
maybe a little bit hard to see but what

00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:55,510
you can see here is that I can

00:52:53,230 --> 00:52:57,760
effectively start playing the video

00:52:55,510 --> 00:53:02,170
while the rest of the page is still

00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:04,210
loading you see the little whatever it's

00:53:02,170 --> 00:53:06,820
called below the video that shows it's

00:53:04,210 --> 00:53:10,420
still loading and so this is also pretty

00:53:06,820 --> 00:53:13,060
powerful because the result is that you

00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:14,500
know users within a few milliseconds

00:53:13,060 --> 00:53:16,570
they can start reading content and

00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:18,280
trying to understand what's going on and

00:53:16,570 --> 00:53:22,270
then more expensive things are being

00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:25,000
added later on and a last but not least

00:53:22,270 --> 00:53:26,740
often these client-side applications

00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:29,830
have sort of an application like

00:53:26,740 --> 00:53:32,530
experience here's another little

00:53:29,830 --> 00:53:35,200
screenshot or you know animated gif of

00:53:32,530 --> 00:53:37,480
Trello which is really a website but it

00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:38,770
kind of works like an application right

00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:43,300
and so this is the kind of stuff people

00:53:38,770 --> 00:53:45,160
once it's not gonna go away right it's

00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:48,580
great so we need to figure out a way to

00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:51,730
to merge these things and to embrace

00:53:48,580 --> 00:53:53,410
them a drupal all right so let's circle

00:53:51,730 --> 00:53:55,990
but let's go back to this architecture

00:53:53,410 --> 00:53:58,869
so the traditional CMS architect

00:53:55,990 --> 00:54:01,780
sure what happens I'm sorry this is a

00:53:58,869 --> 00:54:03,450
little repetitive for some of you just

00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:06,820
want to make sure everybody can follow

00:54:03,450 --> 00:54:09,400
basically as I said the CMS sends the

00:54:06,820 --> 00:54:10,810
layout and the content basically sends a

00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:13,810
whole page to the clients

00:54:10,810 --> 00:54:16,060
so these client-side apps it's a little

00:54:13,810 --> 00:54:19,599
bit different first or typically first

00:54:16,060 --> 00:54:22,540
the app builds the layout and then we'll

00:54:19,599 --> 00:54:25,480
do multiple or you know one or multiple

00:54:22,540 --> 00:54:28,720
requests to the server to get all of the

00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:30,910
content so it may call a MongoDB

00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:32,770
database on the on the server side to

00:54:30,910 --> 00:54:35,589
get bits and pieces of content back in

00:54:32,770 --> 00:54:37,180
JSON and then put you know convert them

00:54:35,589 --> 00:54:38,680
to HTML and put some in the layout and

00:54:37,180 --> 00:54:41,580
then send them to the client or

00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:41,580
something along those lines

00:54:41,670 --> 00:54:48,220
all right so that's that's cool but

00:54:46,089 --> 00:54:51,550
there's a lot of things you lose right

00:54:48,220 --> 00:54:53,589
you lose the editorial tools of Drupal

00:54:51,550 --> 00:54:56,140
like the way you have to put the stuff

00:54:53,589 --> 00:54:59,140
in the MongoDB database may not be that

00:54:56,140 --> 00:55:03,310
easy and so this has led to people call

00:54:59,140 --> 00:55:05,740
decouples or headless CMS's where really

00:55:03,310 --> 00:55:09,190
instead of sort of MongoDB serving the

00:55:05,740 --> 00:55:12,190
content to the app it's really the CMS

00:55:09,190 --> 00:55:16,839
that's been adjusted to serve content

00:55:12,190 --> 00:55:21,460
into the app and so in this model and so

00:55:16,839 --> 00:55:24,220
Drupal 8 is ready for this so we have a

00:55:21,460 --> 00:55:27,730
rest contract effectively people can use

00:55:24,220 --> 00:55:31,980
that to retrieve content you know from

00:55:27,730 --> 00:55:34,780
what in Drupal and to return it as JSON

00:55:31,980 --> 00:55:37,660
but typically in this kind of

00:55:34,780 --> 00:55:40,359
architecture the application still

00:55:37,660 --> 00:55:43,060
builds the layout and will then just

00:55:40,359 --> 00:55:44,980
pull content from from Drupal and like

00:55:43,060 --> 00:55:46,780
one example would be whether com

00:55:44,980 --> 00:55:49,480
one of the biggest websites in the world

00:55:46,780 --> 00:55:52,180
in the top 20 web sites in the world and

00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:55,839
also probably the biggest websites in

00:55:52,180 --> 00:56:00,250
Drupal you know billions of users every

00:55:55,839 --> 00:56:02,349
month they did this and they use like a

00:56:00,250 --> 00:56:04,660
drupal in a decoupled architecture and

00:56:02,349 --> 00:56:07,180
what they have to do on the app site you

00:56:04,660 --> 00:56:10,359
have to build their own layout manager

00:56:07,180 --> 00:56:12,069
and their to rebuild

00:56:10,359 --> 00:56:14,410
you know block placement things that

00:56:12,069 --> 00:56:18,249
were available in Drupal that they had

00:56:14,410 --> 00:56:24,279
to redo like reinvent on the application

00:56:18,249 --> 00:56:26,380
side alright so in general you know

00:56:24,279 --> 00:56:28,869
Drupal 8 will really love apps we have

00:56:26,380 --> 00:56:31,089
rest restful api for pretty much

00:56:28,869 --> 00:56:32,799
everything in drupal including views

00:56:31,089 --> 00:56:34,989
which will make it very easy to build

00:56:32,799 --> 00:56:39,759
these kinds of decoupled application

00:56:34,989 --> 00:56:43,480
applications but like in the case of

00:56:39,759 --> 00:56:45,609
whether comm it's not always easy

00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:49,690
because there's a lot of things you lose

00:56:45,609 --> 00:56:52,239
and here are some examples you know you

00:56:49,690 --> 00:56:55,289
lose the drupal toolbar at the top of

00:56:52,239 --> 00:56:58,299
the page typically you you often lose

00:56:55,289 --> 00:57:01,630
the the layered management and the block

00:56:58,299 --> 00:57:04,539
placement we've also spent many many

00:57:01,630 --> 00:57:06,940
years perfecting the accessibility of

00:57:04,539 --> 00:57:10,059
drupal and often these things need to be

00:57:06,940 --> 00:57:11,769
reinvented now form validation there's a

00:57:10,059 --> 00:57:13,239
lot of things that you lose when you

00:57:11,769 --> 00:57:15,309
built these applications and it's

00:57:13,239 --> 00:57:18,309
basically not great and so this begs the

00:57:15,309 --> 00:57:20,680
question can we have our cake and eat it

00:57:18,309 --> 00:57:23,980
too is there a world where we have all

00:57:20,680 --> 00:57:26,529
of the benefits of drupal all of your

00:57:23,980 --> 00:57:28,480
site building tools faster performance

00:57:26,529 --> 00:57:30,400
with big pipe because this is a thing i

00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:33,249
haven't talked about a little bit too

00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:36,309
much for them for the keynote but i'll

00:57:33,249 --> 00:57:39,369
do a blog post probably tomorrow which

00:57:36,309 --> 00:57:41,799
goes into much more detail but big pipe

00:57:39,369 --> 00:57:45,519
actually has a performance advantage

00:57:41,799 --> 00:57:47,920
compared to client-side apps the way we

00:57:45,519 --> 00:57:49,420
can cache things on the server based on

00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:51,759
knowledge that we have that does not

00:57:49,420 --> 00:57:53,529
exist in the clients gives us an

00:57:51,759 --> 00:57:57,700
advantage and i'll have a little video

00:57:53,529 --> 00:57:58,809
in my blog post but so how can we get

00:57:57,700 --> 00:58:02,769
all of these benefits of a traditional

00:57:58,809 --> 00:58:07,420
CMS but still keep all of these benefits

00:58:02,769 --> 00:58:10,170
of you know of a client side up right

00:58:07,420 --> 00:58:13,299
and i think we can I've called it

00:58:10,170 --> 00:58:16,630
progressively coupling or component base

00:58:13,299 --> 00:58:19,569
decoupling and the idea is a little bit

00:58:16,630 --> 00:58:20,890
like this so first instead of the app

00:58:19,569 --> 00:58:23,170
building the layout

00:58:20,890 --> 00:58:26,640
you know drupal sends the layout

00:58:23,170 --> 00:58:29,230
that way we can maintain our layer tools

00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:31,030
Drupal will also send a lot of the

00:58:29,230 --> 00:58:32,710
content and we often we can bundle the

00:58:31,030 --> 00:58:35,230
content with the layer things which are

00:58:32,710 --> 00:58:37,360
very cashable things that we know are

00:58:35,230 --> 00:58:42,310
gonna be needed on every page like maybe

00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:44,110
a menu we can send along right and so

00:58:42,310 --> 00:58:46,060
Drupal and with big pipe we can actually

00:58:44,110 --> 00:58:49,380
be smart about it so a big pipe does it

00:58:46,060 --> 00:58:52,560
sense the layout and then it will send

00:58:49,380 --> 00:58:55,510
sort of the fast content first and more

00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:58,300
expensive content it can schedule if you

00:58:55,510 --> 00:59:00,790
will to be sent after it's a little bit

00:58:58,300 --> 00:59:02,440
like what you saw in Facebook right

00:59:00,790 --> 00:59:05,050
where you know things already appear on

00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:07,060
the page but other things come later and

00:59:05,050 --> 00:59:09,310
then the app can still request content

00:59:07,060 --> 00:59:12,490
as well you know after Drupal Center

00:59:09,310 --> 00:59:18,430
content and so this model I think will

00:59:12,490 --> 00:59:20,140
give us the best of both worlds a good

00:59:18,430 --> 00:59:22,270
news is that we Drupal 8 we keep all of

00:59:20,140 --> 00:59:24,370
these options open like you can still

00:59:22,270 --> 00:59:28,810
build traditional Drupal sites if you

00:59:24,370 --> 00:59:30,430
will with you know our built in team

00:59:28,810 --> 00:59:32,800
system which we've actually improved

00:59:30,430 --> 00:59:33,070
quite a bit with Twigg so that will be

00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:36,550
great

00:59:33,070 --> 00:59:39,310
on the other side of the extreme you can

00:59:36,550 --> 00:59:42,310
feed your Drupal site data just like in

00:59:39,310 --> 00:59:44,860
a purely decoupled application and

00:59:42,310 --> 00:59:46,240
that's actually great too because native

00:59:44,860 --> 00:59:49,330
apps and the likes that's you know

00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:52,390
typically what you would use but I think

00:59:49,330 --> 00:59:53,680
there's a large amount of situations

00:59:52,390 --> 00:59:55,840
where you don't want to rebuild

00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:57,880
everything on the client-side but in

00:59:55,840 --> 01:00:01,120
fact you want to keep all of these tools

00:59:57,880 --> 01:00:03,250
that are in Drupal and I think that's

01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:06,910
kind of the progressive decoupled option

01:00:03,250 --> 01:00:09,190
and our content modeling tools our page

01:00:06,910 --> 01:00:10,840
building tools all of these things we're

01:00:09,190 --> 01:00:13,120
really good at these we can actually

01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:17,130
preserve in this world we're not quite

01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:19,600
there yet there's things we can improve

01:00:17,130 --> 01:00:22,380
and actually one of the challenges with

01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:25,180
these kinds of architectures is typical

01:00:22,380 --> 01:00:27,700
typically the fact that they're using

01:00:25,180 --> 01:00:30,370
Resta and the way these api's are built

01:00:27,700 --> 01:00:34,810
so right now often you have to do

01:00:30,370 --> 01:00:36,220
multiple you know rest calls to get all

01:00:34,810 --> 01:00:37,660
the data you want if the

01:00:36,220 --> 01:00:41,410
you know multiple of these calls and

01:00:37,660 --> 01:00:43,359
then you also get often too much data or

01:00:41,410 --> 01:00:45,940
sometimes do a little data like for

01:00:43,359 --> 01:00:49,090
example if you want to use a username

01:00:45,940 --> 01:00:51,760
and you know maybe that's all you want

01:00:49,090 --> 01:00:53,680
this is a username often Drupal will

01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:55,270
send you the email address and this and

01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:57,310
that you don't want all that data he

01:00:55,270 --> 01:01:00,130
just wants the right amount of data and

01:00:57,310 --> 01:01:02,530
you want that with the minimal amount of

01:01:00,130 --> 01:01:06,070
calls because that affects performance

01:01:02,530 --> 01:01:10,119
the rest API calls now the other

01:01:06,070 --> 01:01:12,820
challenge is that you know figuring out

01:01:10,119 --> 01:01:14,230
these API and what the what the response

01:01:12,820 --> 01:01:17,590
objects are is a little bit of a

01:01:14,230 --> 01:01:19,690
challenge to it's not easy so but we

01:01:17,590 --> 01:01:21,849
really need I think the ideal solution

01:01:19,690 --> 01:01:25,540
would be as I mentioned to do a single

01:01:21,849 --> 01:01:28,000
API call you know one request and then

01:01:25,540 --> 01:01:31,410
to be able to get exactly the data that

01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:33,730
you want not too much not too little and

01:01:31,410 --> 01:01:36,820
to build those queries with a much

01:01:33,730 --> 01:01:40,690
better you know developer experience and

01:01:36,820 --> 01:01:43,570
in fact we have that Ruby or Sebastian

01:01:40,690 --> 01:01:45,609
has been working on this for quite quite

01:01:43,570 --> 01:01:47,589
some time as presented about this a

01:01:45,609 --> 01:01:50,859
Drupal con before and I really think we

01:01:47,589 --> 01:01:54,580
should not pay attention to what he's

01:01:50,859 --> 01:01:56,710
doing and consider its for inclusion in

01:01:54,580 --> 01:01:59,230
core even I'll give you a little bit of

01:01:56,710 --> 01:02:01,990
a demo it's called graph QL how many of

01:01:59,230 --> 01:02:05,260
you have heard about graph QL all right

01:02:01,990 --> 01:02:07,930
not that many people but I'll show you a

01:02:05,260 --> 01:02:09,490
video I'll try to talk about it while

01:02:07,930 --> 01:02:11,890
the video is playing but it gives you an

01:02:09,490 --> 01:02:14,800
idea of how this works so here's the

01:02:11,890 --> 01:02:19,810
graph I cube lui it's actually in Drupal

01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:22,180
how long I need to restart this video

01:02:19,810 --> 01:02:25,540
all right so this is a Drupal site it

01:02:22,180 --> 01:02:27,280
has some notes or entities or events all

01:02:25,540 --> 01:02:29,980
of the Drupal cons you can see there is

01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:33,580
a city filled a region a year the kind

01:02:29,980 --> 01:02:35,500
of stuff right and so now we switch to

01:02:33,580 --> 01:02:37,060
this UI which is you know also in Drupal

01:02:35,500 --> 01:02:41,320
and it's basically a query language you

01:02:37,060 --> 01:02:44,410
can say you know give me you know give

01:02:41,320 --> 01:02:46,089
me no three really and here's what I

01:02:44,410 --> 01:02:47,890
want I wanna I want you to give me that

01:02:46,089 --> 01:02:51,220
the title field

01:02:47,890 --> 01:02:54,279
and say returns his JSON object so

01:02:51,220 --> 01:02:56,710
pretty easy so you can do more complex

01:02:54,279 --> 01:02:59,200
things you can you know start with a

01:02:56,710 --> 01:03:02,650
view and sort of pick it apart you can

01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:05,680
say give me let's see what it's gonna do

01:03:02,650 --> 01:03:08,079
you know give me all the all the notes

01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:11,230
and return the title and so you get a

01:03:08,079 --> 01:03:11,829
list of all the Drupal cons you know on

01:03:11,230 --> 01:03:13,869
my site

01:03:11,829 --> 01:03:16,599
and so you may want to say actually

01:03:13,869 --> 01:03:18,460
filter all of these by the ones that

01:03:16,599 --> 01:03:20,619
were in Europe so you can apply a very

01:03:18,460 --> 01:03:24,930
quick filter and so you can see now it

01:03:20,619 --> 01:03:27,099
only is returning European Drupal cons

01:03:24,930 --> 01:03:28,930
now it can be a little bit more explicit

01:03:27,099 --> 01:03:32,529
about anything else that you want until

01:03:28,930 --> 01:03:35,950
you do if the returns are of the type

01:03:32,529 --> 01:03:38,529
entity note conference please show me

01:03:35,950 --> 01:03:41,440
the city the separate field that you saw

01:03:38,529 --> 01:03:44,079
in the UI and also show me the year that

01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:46,119
event took place so very easily you can

01:03:44,079 --> 01:03:49,450
create these queries with a very

01:03:46,119 --> 01:03:50,950
easy-to-use tool just like it really

01:03:49,450 --> 01:03:56,410
helps you build the queries and here you

01:03:50,950 --> 01:03:57,789
go all in a JSON format the other cool

01:03:56,410 --> 01:04:00,190
thing you can do is you can actually

01:03:57,789 --> 01:04:02,499
follow references and this is where you

01:04:00,190 --> 01:04:05,980
can start to eliminate multiple queries

01:04:02,499 --> 01:04:08,559
but you can see a know you know use the

01:04:05,980 --> 01:04:11,049
the user ID and then follow that down

01:04:08,559 --> 01:04:14,109
with evil in the object model in the

01:04:11,049 --> 01:04:16,599
Drupal model and give me the name of

01:04:14,109 --> 01:04:17,319
that user idea and so you can see it

01:04:16,599 --> 01:04:19,390
returned

01:04:17,319 --> 01:04:21,130
you know admin there and then there's

01:04:19,390 --> 01:04:23,349
all sorts of other little things you can

01:04:21,130 --> 01:04:25,480
do it can like alias that user idea just

01:04:23,349 --> 01:04:27,400
to make the the output a little bit

01:04:25,480 --> 01:04:28,839
nicer to work with for front-end

01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:32,259
developer so now it's called author

01:04:28,839 --> 01:04:35,230
instead of UID so this is a very quick

01:04:32,259 --> 01:04:37,119
demo they give you an idea of some of

01:04:35,230 --> 01:04:40,930
the power of graph QL and how it

01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:45,339
actually would be better than rest in my

01:04:40,930 --> 01:04:50,259
opinion so I don't know if Sebastian is

01:04:45,339 --> 01:04:52,829
here was he here I don't see him but if

01:04:50,259 --> 01:04:55,029
he has a session go check it out

01:04:52,829 --> 01:04:58,029
and so really what it does is it takes

01:04:55,029 --> 01:05:00,730
is you know rest concepts changes it

01:04:58,029 --> 01:05:02,320
into a graph QL and you know reduces the

01:05:00,730 --> 01:05:03,850
number of

01:05:02,320 --> 01:05:05,500
and all of this is actually made

01:05:03,850 --> 01:05:09,100
possible and this is another example of

01:05:05,500 --> 01:05:10,480
why we are ahead of the others like this

01:05:09,100 --> 01:05:12,820
is made possible because of the

01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:15,730
serialization and the type data in

01:05:12,820 --> 01:05:18,070
Drupal 8 these are the things you guys

01:05:15,730 --> 01:05:19,750
have to keep in mind when people compare

01:05:18,070 --> 01:05:22,480
ourselves with other you know

01:05:19,750 --> 01:05:25,360
competitors and in fact all of this is

01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:27,430
already income trip for Drupal 8 so we

01:05:25,360 --> 01:05:30,070
can start playing with that today and

01:05:27,430 --> 01:05:32,410
making it better and so I think this

01:05:30,070 --> 01:05:35,200
idea of progressively coupling and

01:05:32,410 --> 01:05:38,410
making that better so we can maintain

01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:39,820
all of the features of Drupal and yet

01:05:38,410 --> 01:05:40,810
leverage all of the advantages of

01:05:39,820 --> 01:05:43,330
client-side apps

01:05:40,810 --> 01:05:45,880
combined with graph QL I really truly

01:05:43,330 --> 01:05:49,390
believe it puts his way ahead of you

01:05:45,880 --> 01:05:52,030
know virtually any other competitor so

01:05:49,390 --> 01:05:53,980
I'm very excited about that and I really

01:05:52,030 --> 01:05:57,520
do believe we need to keep exploring

01:05:53,980 --> 01:06:03,520
that you know you know future versions

01:05:57,520 --> 01:06:06,310
of Drupal all right so the summing up I

01:06:03,520 --> 01:06:09,160
think fully decoupled it's not always

01:06:06,310 --> 01:06:10,930
the base the best solution in fact I

01:06:09,160 --> 01:06:14,490
only think it's the best solution in a

01:06:10,930 --> 01:06:17,740
very narrow set of use cases I think

01:06:14,490 --> 01:06:19,840
progressively coupling is often a better

01:06:17,740 --> 01:06:22,170
solution and gives us the best of both

01:06:19,840 --> 01:06:26,890
worlds and I do believe that Drupal 8

01:06:22,170 --> 01:06:29,170
combined with graph QL there's gonna be

01:06:26,890 --> 01:06:31,960
an ideal platform for building you know

01:06:29,170 --> 01:06:33,610
websites and for building apps I think

01:06:31,960 --> 01:06:37,600
it's it's a very exciting place to be

01:06:33,610 --> 01:06:42,940
for us I talked about all of these three

01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:45,580
things I think the key takeaways are we

01:06:42,940 --> 01:06:48,580
have to release Drupal 8 and when we do

01:06:45,580 --> 01:06:51,130
I can promise you that's a momentum will

01:06:48,580 --> 01:06:53,970
come back what's gonna happen there's a

01:06:51,130 --> 01:06:56,440
lot of evidence from talking to people

01:06:53,970 --> 01:06:58,870
almost everybody that I talk to they're

01:06:56,440 --> 01:07:03,640
waiting for Drupal 8 so we just have to

01:06:58,870 --> 01:07:06,250
unleash that momentum fortunately we're

01:07:03,640 --> 01:07:09,130
close we need to move to a more

01:07:06,250 --> 01:07:11,800
sustainable release process a more

01:07:09,130 --> 01:07:13,210
sustainable development process you know

01:07:11,800 --> 01:07:15,010
one that's healthy

01:07:13,210 --> 01:07:18,579
LT for the project and healthy for the

01:07:15,010 --> 01:07:21,819
contributors I think we need to do a

01:07:18,579 --> 01:07:24,369
better job putting non coders first to

01:07:21,819 --> 01:07:26,550
increase our impact you know the thing

01:07:24,369 --> 01:07:29,559
we can learn the most from WordPress

01:07:26,550 --> 01:07:32,079
when for I really believe that Drupal

01:07:29,559 --> 01:07:36,010
will be a go-to platform for both sites

01:07:32,079 --> 01:07:39,369
and apps I hope you guys are excited

01:07:36,010 --> 01:07:45,250
about all of that and I have one final

01:07:39,369 --> 01:07:46,720
note this is more of a thought but I've

01:07:45,250 --> 01:07:48,579
always been pretty excited about the web

01:07:46,720 --> 01:07:52,869
and the impact that the web can have

01:07:48,579 --> 01:07:56,260
from the world how it helps to you know

01:07:52,869 --> 01:07:58,720
connect people so if you think about it

01:07:56,260 --> 01:08:01,510
today there is roughly 3.1 billion

01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:04,270
people online people with the internet I

01:08:01,510 --> 01:08:07,390
have internet access so if you think

01:08:04,270 --> 01:08:10,900
about the fact that Drupal powers one in

01:08:07,390 --> 01:08:13,359
40 websites it's we sort of touch every

01:08:10,900 --> 01:08:16,299
user on the Internet because everybody

01:08:13,359 --> 01:08:18,759
that uses more than 40 websites chances

01:08:16,299 --> 01:08:22,719
are we're statistically speaking that

01:08:18,759 --> 01:08:26,620
person has used Drupal I thought it was

01:08:22,719 --> 01:08:29,140
a really really cool idea that Drupal

01:08:26,620 --> 01:08:31,509
basically touches everybody on the

01:08:29,140 --> 01:08:33,699
Internet and then in the next few years

01:08:31,509 --> 01:08:35,799
the growth is actually quite staggering

01:08:33,699 --> 01:08:38,049
so they're predicted in the next few

01:08:35,799 --> 01:08:40,029
years like one point you know eight

01:08:38,049 --> 01:08:43,179
billion people will come online new

01:08:40,029 --> 01:08:44,949
people they don't have internet today so

01:08:43,179 --> 01:08:49,210
the idea that you know Drupal and Drupal

01:08:44,949 --> 01:08:51,250
8 will be able to touch all of these you

01:08:49,210 --> 01:08:53,469
know it's quite special and no makes me

01:08:51,250 --> 01:08:56,710
very proud to to be part of this project

01:08:53,469 --> 01:08:58,810
and to have started Drupal to see that

01:08:56,710 --> 01:09:03,370
we can have that reach and touch that

01:08:58,810 --> 01:09:05,020
many people in the world if you want a

01:09:03,370 --> 01:09:08,859
little bit more details about everything

01:09:05,020 --> 01:09:11,440
I talked about go to my blog you can

01:09:08,859 --> 01:09:13,810
subscribe to it if you want but for each

01:09:11,440 --> 01:09:17,230
of these things I'll post a longer blog

01:09:13,810 --> 01:09:18,370
post like I'll do with you know maybe

01:09:17,230 --> 01:09:20,859
even double the amount of information

01:09:18,370 --> 01:09:23,529
then that I covered in Aikido so it will

01:09:20,859 --> 01:09:25,120
be great to continue the conversation or

01:09:23,529 --> 01:09:26,220
to get a little bit more technical and

01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:29,360
in some of it and

01:09:26,220 --> 01:09:33,210
bit more just get a little bit more data

01:09:29,360 --> 01:09:36,350
so feel free to do that and that's it

01:09:33,210 --> 01:09:36,350
thank you very much

01:09:46,560 --> 01:10:00,010
my dream about ten minutes it's not me

01:09:56,940 --> 01:10:01,750
another Talent

01:10:00,010 --> 01:10:04,750
where do you think the most feedback

01:10:01,750 --> 01:10:06,190
from your talk what topic because there

01:10:04,750 --> 01:10:09,849
was one that was overwhelming really

01:10:06,190 --> 01:10:11,920
more questions about no I have no idea

01:10:09,849 --> 01:10:13,810
Drupal 8 or future Drupal core

01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:16,929
development workflow oh really okay

01:10:13,810 --> 01:10:20,290
that's good so you know we had I broke

01:10:16,929 --> 01:10:22,389
down probably about six questions so

01:10:20,290 --> 01:10:24,849
I'll pop a few at a time and we'll see

01:10:22,389 --> 01:10:27,960
how it goes so he mention we're gonna

01:10:24,849 --> 01:10:30,460
change the way we work after da chips

01:10:27,960 --> 01:10:31,630
so does this mean that we need to fit we

01:10:30,460 --> 01:10:36,489
need to figure out this new process

01:10:31,630 --> 01:10:38,139
before we move past a point I mean it

01:10:36,489 --> 01:10:39,880
would be good to do I mean it we're

01:10:38,139 --> 01:10:41,920
gonna actually try and spend some time

01:10:39,880 --> 01:10:46,060
on this this week to figure out some

01:10:41,920 --> 01:10:48,190
more details I mean we don't have to you

01:10:46,060 --> 01:10:50,110
know it only becomes relevant once we

01:10:48,190 --> 01:10:52,739
decide to build building new features

01:10:50,110 --> 01:10:55,420
you know after Drupal 8 is released so

01:10:52,739 --> 01:10:58,360
sooner we figure it out you know the

01:10:55,420 --> 01:11:00,820
better in a way but we can we can afford

01:10:58,360 --> 01:11:03,040
to take the time to to figure out how

01:11:00,820 --> 01:11:04,540
we're gonna do it alright I would say

01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:08,650
ideally we figured out by the time

01:11:04,540 --> 01:11:10,090
Drupal 8 that's zero the zero ships fair

01:11:08,650 --> 01:11:12,159
enough all right so I'm gonna apologize

01:11:10,090 --> 01:11:15,639
in advance for butchering some of these

01:11:12,159 --> 01:11:19,179
names so a couple of questions that came

01:11:15,639 --> 01:11:20,530
in Julian de Brito I believe just

01:11:19,179 --> 01:11:22,989
changing the approach of releasing

01:11:20,530 --> 01:11:25,030
Drupal and MVPs and shippable features

01:11:22,989 --> 01:11:28,320
means Drupal will stay in version 8 and

01:11:25,030 --> 01:11:33,550
definitely will they'll be a Drupal 9

01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:37,210
point yeah it's a good question you know

01:11:33,550 --> 01:11:39,250
I think hey you know it could be because

01:11:37,210 --> 01:11:42,580
you know it should allow us to have more

01:11:39,250 --> 01:11:44,170
features through Drupal 8 as we go but

01:11:42,580 --> 01:11:47,020
the one thing that we committed to is

01:11:44,170 --> 01:11:50,080
that we would maintain backwards

01:11:47,020 --> 01:11:52,030
compatibility right and so in an ideal

01:11:50,080 --> 01:11:53,290
world where we can add a lot of features

01:11:52,030 --> 01:11:55,179
to add Rupali

01:11:53,290 --> 01:11:58,150
you know for all of the minor versions

01:11:55,179 --> 01:11:58,760
of Drupal you know Drupal 9 version and

01:11:58,150 --> 01:12:00,199
actually this

01:11:58,760 --> 01:12:03,250
we discussed is already a little bit but

01:12:00,199 --> 01:12:08,050
you know chechen Alex and ng and just

01:12:03,250 --> 01:12:11,420
that technically Drupal nine could be

01:12:08,050 --> 01:12:13,369
like the last Drupal eight version where

01:12:11,420 --> 01:12:18,079
we just remove the layers of backwards

01:12:13,369 --> 01:12:19,909
compatibility so it could be close to

01:12:18,079 --> 01:12:21,650
that but they're still gonna be we're

01:12:19,909 --> 01:12:23,510
still gonna need these points for every

01:12:21,650 --> 01:12:25,099
remove you know a lot of the backwards

01:12:23,510 --> 01:12:27,530
compatibility just so we don't slow down

01:12:25,099 --> 01:12:30,679
the system and you know we clean up some

01:12:27,530 --> 01:12:32,690
of the code but it I guess a short

01:12:30,679 --> 01:12:35,510
version is yes hopefully we'll see more

01:12:32,690 --> 01:12:37,579
continuous innovation we're you know

01:12:35,510 --> 01:12:41,929
fairly big you know features will be

01:12:37,579 --> 01:12:45,219
added to Drupal 8 along the way um can

01:12:41,929 --> 01:12:47,329
we add the ability to Fort core

01:12:45,219 --> 01:12:49,809
developers to create their own feature

01:12:47,329 --> 01:12:53,539
initiatives and then version back in

01:12:49,809 --> 01:12:55,849
yeah I mean I think that's one of the

01:12:53,539 --> 01:12:57,829
open questions like you know how many of

01:12:55,849 --> 01:12:59,420
these features are branches right are

01:12:57,829 --> 01:13:01,219
there gonna be official feature branches

01:12:59,420 --> 01:13:03,469
and then unofficial future branches can

01:13:01,219 --> 01:13:06,019
anybody start a future brand yeah so we

01:13:03,469 --> 01:13:08,179
don't know yet from however I will say

01:13:06,019 --> 01:13:11,179
that I'm pretty passionate about sort of

01:13:08,179 --> 01:13:14,389
keeping this idea of you know

01:13:11,179 --> 01:13:16,400
permissionless innovation where anyone

01:13:14,389 --> 01:13:17,989
can say oh I'm gonna you know at this

01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:19,400
you know I'm gonna try and get this

01:13:17,989 --> 01:13:21,170
feature into the next version of Drupal

01:13:19,400 --> 01:13:23,059
like I think some of the best things

01:13:21,170 --> 01:13:25,639
that happened to Drupal is exactly that

01:13:23,059 --> 01:13:28,369
like the unexpected unplanned features

01:13:25,639 --> 01:13:31,280
and so the big question is how can we

01:13:28,369 --> 01:13:33,530
how can we keep that in our in our

01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:36,170
process right so that these unexpected

01:13:33,530 --> 01:13:38,360
things that are great can happen at the

01:13:36,170 --> 01:13:41,090
same time it's not too hard to imagine

01:13:38,360 --> 01:13:43,400
not having 200 of these feature branches

01:13:41,090 --> 01:13:46,070
is gonna be a little bit unwieldy and

01:13:43,400 --> 01:13:47,900
that we may have to you know we may have

01:13:46,070 --> 01:13:49,610
to have a process that's alright let's

01:13:47,900 --> 01:13:51,889
work on these things now maybe let's

01:13:49,610 --> 01:13:54,590
wait for this feature to get started so

01:13:51,889 --> 01:13:56,599
we kind of not complicate our lives too

01:13:54,590 --> 01:13:59,150
much but again a lot of these details we

01:13:56,599 --> 01:14:00,800
have to figure out I think all what

01:13:59,150 --> 01:14:02,599
we'll do is we'll think about them we'll

01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:04,969
try to document them all solicit

01:14:02,599 --> 01:14:06,440
feedback from the community but a lot of

01:14:04,969 --> 01:14:08,869
it will be learning as we go and

01:14:06,440 --> 01:14:11,000
adjusting the process as we go so well

01:14:08,869 --> 01:14:11,120
you should expect us to see do is kind

01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,100
of

01:14:11,120 --> 01:14:16,160
ease into it maybe a little bit more

01:14:13,100 --> 01:14:17,570
restrictive an email like but then you

01:14:16,160 --> 01:14:19,790
know it's gonna open it up more and more

01:14:17,570 --> 01:14:23,900
as we get our sea legs if people and we

01:14:19,790 --> 01:14:24,950
know exactly how things will work so I

01:14:23,900 --> 01:14:26,630
think this question is gonna have a

01:14:24,950 --> 01:14:27,920
similar answer better to ask anyway

01:14:26,630 --> 01:14:29,720
because it popped into my head as you

01:14:27,920 --> 01:14:31,430
were talking and then somebody asked on

01:14:29,720 --> 01:14:34,580
Twitter and it got retweeted a bunch of

01:14:31,430 --> 01:14:37,130
times I believe the original poster was

01:14:34,580 --> 01:14:39,140
a sheesh ticker again sorry if I

01:14:37,130 --> 01:14:41,780
butchered your name future based

01:14:39,140 --> 01:14:43,790
branching sounds cool but current issues

01:14:41,780 --> 01:14:47,480
in drupal.org get infrastructure is not

01:14:43,790 --> 01:14:50,540
fit for that do we shift to github or a

01:14:47,480 --> 01:14:53,300
similar model yeah that's a that's a

01:14:50,540 --> 01:14:55,490
good question it's a very complex

01:14:53,300 --> 01:14:59,230
question as well there's so many things

01:14:55,490 --> 01:15:01,910
that we use that do not exist in github

01:14:59,230 --> 01:15:05,000
so I don't think of an answer for that

01:15:01,910 --> 01:15:08,540
but it seems you know I think it's safe

01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:11,270
to say that feature branches will not be

01:15:08,540 --> 01:15:12,980
the trigger to the only trigger if we do

01:15:11,270 --> 01:15:15,590
decide to move to get up it will be much

01:15:12,980 --> 01:15:19,100
more holistic approach to it I think for

01:15:15,590 --> 01:15:24,020
now we're pretty set on staying you know

01:15:19,100 --> 01:15:26,450
Wendy ditto Donna Benjamin asks new

01:15:24,020 --> 01:15:29,240
topic here so we need to recognize non

01:15:26,450 --> 01:15:32,030
coders in the community as first-class

01:15:29,240 --> 01:15:33,650
citizens we've kind of started moving

01:15:32,030 --> 01:15:36,500
that direction with updates to the

01:15:33,650 --> 01:15:38,360
drupal.org profile pages but how do we

01:15:36,500 --> 01:15:40,460
go further what are the next steps in

01:15:38,360 --> 01:15:42,800
making sure that people who don't code

01:15:40,460 --> 01:15:45,320
but contribute you know huge amounts of

01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:47,330
time are considered you know first-class

01:15:45,320 --> 01:15:49,790
citizens yeah we have some I totally

01:15:47,330 --> 01:15:51,830
agree with Donna first of all at you

01:15:49,790 --> 01:15:52,400
know yes we have to recognize all of the

01:15:51,830 --> 01:15:54,200
contributors

01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:56,000
you know people that write documentation

01:15:54,200 --> 01:15:58,190
and people that you know sponsor events

01:15:56,000 --> 01:16:01,400
people I mean whatever it is they do I

01:15:58,190 --> 01:16:04,550
think we need to to figure out how can

01:16:01,400 --> 01:16:07,250
we best recognize that a lot of the and

01:16:04,550 --> 01:16:09,290
so far actually we've been rolling at

01:16:07,250 --> 01:16:11,720
the credit system that I talked about

01:16:09,290 --> 01:16:14,390
last year you know and that's actually

01:16:11,720 --> 01:16:16,340
in place we're still kind of rolling out

01:16:14,390 --> 01:16:21,830
where these credits are being you know

01:16:16,340 --> 01:16:23,570
shown but they're still only focused on

01:16:21,830 --> 01:16:25,489
people that contribute code

01:16:23,570 --> 01:16:26,840
and you know that in a way that's a

01:16:25,489 --> 01:16:27,800
great thing like you know it's a good

01:16:26,840 --> 01:16:29,630
first step

01:16:27,800 --> 01:16:32,570
and it's okay to make incremental

01:16:29,630 --> 01:16:34,909
improvements we can't expect to kind of

01:16:32,570 --> 01:16:37,730
roll out it's a system big bang style

01:16:34,909 --> 01:16:39,409
that incorporates every single kinds of

01:16:37,730 --> 01:16:40,969
contributor but what's important now is

01:16:39,409 --> 01:16:42,969
that we keep iterating that we keep

01:16:40,969 --> 01:16:47,239
adding these other ways of recognizing

01:16:42,969 --> 01:16:49,789
contributions how exactly we're going to

01:16:47,239 --> 01:16:51,590
do that you know I don't know right now

01:16:49,789 --> 01:16:53,119
I would have to talk to the Drupal

01:16:51,590 --> 01:16:54,880
Association about that because they're

01:16:53,119 --> 01:16:59,960
actually building all of these things

01:16:54,880 --> 01:17:01,489
but yeah we should do that okay so a

01:16:59,960 --> 01:17:03,139
couple of months ago I believe Larry

01:17:01,489 --> 01:17:04,989
Garfield published a blog post actually

01:17:03,139 --> 01:17:08,119
the back in July I have here in my notes

01:17:04,989 --> 01:17:11,989
arguing that we should focus Drupal core

01:17:08,119 --> 01:17:13,550
more to possibly stop trying to be all

01:17:11,989 --> 01:17:14,840
things to all people I think he used

01:17:13,550 --> 01:17:18,050
like the peanut butter analogy we're

01:17:14,840 --> 01:17:19,610
spreading ourselves too thin so for

01:17:18,050 --> 01:17:21,710
instance you know maybe we should focus

01:17:19,610 --> 01:17:24,650
on the structured content capabilities

01:17:21,710 --> 01:17:26,719
of Drupal as a differentiator and that

01:17:24,650 --> 01:17:30,050
if your site needs structured content

01:17:26,719 --> 01:17:32,630
you should be looking at Drupal right if

01:17:30,050 --> 01:17:35,780
we do something if we do it I don't say

01:17:32,630 --> 01:17:38,179
officially focused Drupal Mar right how

01:17:35,780 --> 01:17:41,599
do we you know that these are going to

01:17:38,179 --> 01:17:42,949
deprioritize other parts of the market

01:17:41,599 --> 01:17:47,000
how do we deal with that how do we

01:17:42,949 --> 01:17:49,130
handle that yeah again great question

01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:54,530
not an easy answer there's definitely

01:17:49,130 --> 01:17:57,650
you know like but I do think you know we

01:17:54,530 --> 01:17:59,179
we focused Drupal you know through the

01:17:57,650 --> 01:18:01,719
initiatives and stuff you know I think

01:17:59,179 --> 01:18:03,889
we have brought a focus to the table

01:18:01,719 --> 01:18:05,420
it's not official though it's not in the

01:18:03,889 --> 01:18:08,019
mission statement it's not in the

01:18:05,420 --> 01:18:10,610
mission statement no but it's I mean

01:18:08,019 --> 01:18:12,679
apples mission statement is build great

01:18:10,610 --> 01:18:13,909
products I mean they don't say what

01:18:12,679 --> 01:18:17,150
features are gonna add to the next

01:18:13,909 --> 01:18:18,429
iPhone either right so but you know

01:18:17,150 --> 01:18:21,409
based on what I talked about today

01:18:18,429 --> 01:18:23,960
clearly what I'm what I'm pushing for is

01:18:21,409 --> 01:18:26,900
is you know recognizing the content

01:18:23,960 --> 01:18:29,090
modeling tools you know recognizing that

01:18:26,900 --> 01:18:32,239
Drupal can be great for multi-channel

01:18:29,090 --> 01:18:34,679
publishing recognizing that we can build

01:18:32,239 --> 01:18:37,110
multiple hats the Drupal

01:18:34,679 --> 01:18:39,150
and so you know I think we're really

01:18:37,110 --> 01:18:41,640
good at that you know so I explained

01:18:39,150 --> 01:18:43,800
today and then I also suggested that we

01:18:41,640 --> 01:18:45,060
even need to get better at that I'm not

01:18:43,800 --> 01:18:46,980
saying that's the only thing we have to

01:18:45,060 --> 01:18:48,360
focus on it's gonna be other things that

01:18:46,980 --> 01:18:50,640
we need to focus on as well

01:18:48,360 --> 01:18:51,840
you know like user experience but other

01:18:50,640 --> 01:18:56,040
than the things in a keynote there's

01:18:51,840 --> 01:18:58,290
some there's gonna be other things but

01:18:56,040 --> 01:19:01,890
yeah I think saying no to things will be

01:18:58,290 --> 01:19:04,290
very helpful all right so again it's

01:19:01,890 --> 01:19:07,260
gonna be a process to figure out what

01:19:04,290 --> 01:19:09,719
exactly we're gonna focus on but you

01:19:07,260 --> 01:19:12,750
know I run long time so I have two quick

01:19:09,719 --> 01:19:14,969
ones for you this one came in from

01:19:12,750 --> 01:19:17,460
Twitter via Mike Herschel if you had a

01:19:14,969 --> 01:19:19,949
time machine I can go back to I looked

01:19:17,460 --> 01:19:23,130
up the date March 11 2011 when the

01:19:19,949 --> 01:19:24,840
Drupal 8 development branch opened if

01:19:23,130 --> 01:19:26,880
you go back in time what advice would

01:19:24,840 --> 01:19:32,370
you give yourself about the Drupal 8

01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:33,960
development cycle well if I knew what I

01:19:32,370 --> 01:19:38,310
knew today I would probably push the

01:19:33,960 --> 01:19:40,199
feature branching to be honest like no I

01:19:38,310 --> 01:19:43,350
mean I think you would that would have

01:19:40,199 --> 01:19:45,390
been great okay all right the last one

01:19:43,350 --> 01:19:47,159
I'm picking this one just because you

01:19:45,390 --> 01:19:48,870
know we honored Kathy earlier with the

01:19:47,159 --> 01:19:52,560
award and now I just wanna see your head

01:19:48,870 --> 01:19:55,350

mark comment I try to join the sprint

01:19:55,350 --> 01:20:02,070

01:19:57,150 --> 01:20:10,469
person how do I help yeah just go find

01:20:02,070 --> 01:20:11,960
Kathy right need a lot of UI people yeah

01:20:10,469 --> 01:20:14,940
that's what we need the most I would say

01:20:11,960 --> 01:20:16,770
