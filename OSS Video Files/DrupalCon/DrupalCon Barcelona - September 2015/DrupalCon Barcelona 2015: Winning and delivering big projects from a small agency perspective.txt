00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:05,340
we will try to introduce all the context

00:06:02,669 --> 00:06:09,000
what is the small agency and which type

00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:12,750
of projects it's typical for us which

00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:23,240
subject of agency do you work about five

00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:29,819
to ten people ten to fifteen 15 to 50

00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:35,879
more than 50 and more than 100 okay this

00:06:29,819 --> 00:06:38,460
is because insisted then what about the

00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:41,430
team and this kind of things the sales

00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:44,180
process it's very different the

00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:48,020
mythology about the internal like

00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:51,560
development methodology and the sales or

00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:56,699
client mythology working closely with

00:06:51,560 --> 00:07:00,210
client the culture about that and what

00:06:56,699 --> 00:07:06,360
is the impact and how can impact in our

00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:10,020
finance on in our team the contact what

00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:13,230
is a small agency for me for me and very

00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:18,690
small agencies three to 10 people maybe

00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:22,320
a to 20 or 30 people these are

00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:28,280
multifunctional team people in this kind

00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:33,420
of team its business people design

00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:36,120
development testing sales of that maybe

00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:38,550
usually it's done by the same person may

00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:40,560
be on this kind of agencies the

00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:45,290
salesperson and the project manager is

00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:48,420
the same and with an horizontal

00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:53,160
architecture there is no big director

00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:56,400
and vice director and CTO and CEO and

00:07:53,160 --> 00:08:00,540
project manager is usually horizontal

00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:04,860
okay what are the typical project for

00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:08,900
this type of companies it's one to four

00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:11,460
months maybe six months but not more

00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:13,560
every project leads from a different

00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:17,070
client we have a lot of rotation of

00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:21,690
clients it's very hard at the beginning

00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:24,000
for us and when working with big big

00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:29,010
clients usually we have a layer in the

00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:31,830
middle like advertising our publishing

00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:34,440
nations's and this is not very good for

00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:37,200
small agencies because we can't contact

00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:40,470
directly with client and then we can't

00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:45,030
measure what is their needs and what is

00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:47,880
their problems and what is our desire

00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:50,280
our desire is to remove these layers

00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:54,450
contact bitter click with the client or

00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:59,940
with the product manager or any way the

00:08:54,450 --> 00:09:03,330
person who want this project we want

00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:07,560
projects that is during more than six

00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:10,680
months because we need less rotation and

00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:14,420
focus on on development or focus on

00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:17,490
business and on different things but not

00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:21,060
changing every month on different

00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:23,400
projects try to repeat several

00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:27,059
projection in the same client because

00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:29,549
when I know a client it's

00:09:27,059 --> 00:09:33,449
maybe better or not depends on the

00:09:29,549 --> 00:09:39,179
client is better to try to win another

00:09:33,449 --> 00:09:42,119
project and how can we do it and at the

00:09:39,179 --> 00:09:44,759
end how we can do all of these things to

00:09:42,119 --> 00:09:47,579
transfer my agency to be the perfect one

00:09:44,759 --> 00:09:50,609
for this kind of clients how we can do

00:09:47,579 --> 00:09:52,729
it please if you wan you have any

00:09:50,609 --> 00:09:57,799
questions or there is something that you

00:09:52,729 --> 00:10:03,209
understand please sandy hub first of all

00:09:57,799 --> 00:10:04,889
which type of teams we can have it is

00:10:03,209 --> 00:10:08,099
impossible to have all the expertise on

00:10:04,889 --> 00:10:12,599
this kind of agencies because of the

00:10:08,099 --> 00:10:14,669
size we can have a person focus on sales

00:10:12,599 --> 00:10:17,389
and focus on performance or focus on

00:10:14,669 --> 00:10:20,849
back and development early we have a

00:10:17,389 --> 00:10:24,239
multifunctional team usually but we can

00:10:20,849 --> 00:10:28,279
focus on to type of agencies we can be

00:10:24,239 --> 00:10:31,829
generalized or we can focus all of our

00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:34,799
development or our services in one or

00:10:31,829 --> 00:10:37,829
two or three services if we are

00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:41,519
generalized we have developers like on a

00:10:37,829 --> 00:10:45,119
scrum that don't have any specific area

00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:48,539
they don't have only one knowledge on

00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:53,729
all the layers they can do front turn

00:10:48,539 --> 00:10:56,819
back on or or anything usually but

00:10:53,729 --> 00:10:59,849
usually we you have a person that it's

00:10:56,819 --> 00:11:01,439
doing all the front end but if they if

00:10:59,849 --> 00:11:08,249
you need something on back end they can

00:11:01,439 --> 00:11:11,639
do it not at the best or you have a an

00:11:08,249 --> 00:11:14,369
agency focus on services because you

00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:20,639
have a lot of knowledge for example on

00:11:14,369 --> 00:11:24,419
performance or own servers then you can

00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:28,349
focus on that have a set of services

00:11:24,419 --> 00:11:32,749
that you are very very very good on that

00:11:28,349 --> 00:11:36,329
and try to to find the clients for this

00:11:32,749 --> 00:11:39,479
services in my experience for example

00:11:36,329 --> 00:11:40,740
it's not maybe on the Spanish market

00:11:39,479 --> 00:11:43,950
that is not very good

00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:47,190
that is better the first type of fancy

00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:49,820
but I know a lot of Drupal agencies that

00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:55,110
are focus on service on are very good

00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:59,190
and what about the big question how can

00:11:55,110 --> 00:12:02,459
you playing your resources sorry and

00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:06,510
working pigs you have a project that

00:12:02,459 --> 00:12:12,000
it's that have problems and you have a

00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:16,920
very very sized team how can you manage

00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:20,880
that kind of things then try to adapt

00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:25,050
your work on your team to the work it's

00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:28,410
like two directional problem or two

00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:30,209
directional thing your team needs to add

00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:32,670
up to the work that you have and in the

00:12:30,209 --> 00:12:37,140
work that you have tries to up to your

00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:40,800
team we were of the mistake was my

00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:42,690
mistake to hire new people when you have

00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:45,270
a working pig it's not very good because

00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:48,120
the working pick on margin sees it's

00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:51,390
very very different you can have two

00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:54,120
projects on one month there is 10

00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:57,029
projects and then to britx an hour month

00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:59,130
it's not a problem for me the best one

00:12:57,029 --> 00:13:02,339
is to create a network of contracts

00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:05,310
people that you teach them about your

00:13:02,339 --> 00:13:07,680
mythology development and client these

00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:14,399
kind of things and try to work with them

00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:17,640
when you have working peak and what

00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:21,300
about the sales process because this is

00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:25,050
an Arabic problem how to introduce in

00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:29,130
that customer type there is the classic

00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:32,750
thing which is you by mail or making a

00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:36,420
little visit or something like that it's

00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:39,690
very dangerous for us like Anna's

00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:43,680
mahajan tea because you want to go to a

00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:47,660
big client they usually don't know who

00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:54,700
you are and then they don't trust in you

00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:57,580
but you can use your your clients

00:13:54,700 --> 00:14:00,310
and try to introduce to another client

00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:03,340
of the same type by them for example if

00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:06,790
you work for an NGO and you have one to

00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:09,070
work for another NGO try to use this one

00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:12,040
to introduce to the other one it's

00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:14,230
something that seems very very clear but

00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:19,450
for small agencies I think it's one of

00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:21,820
the keys of our performance Anna lower

00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:24,360
its be an expert and then try to be a

00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:29,680
need for them try to be an expert on

00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:32,830
something and then try to go to a to a

00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:35,650
client and say okay I know that you need

00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:38,230
this thing I'm an expert on that thing

00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:44,800
we can work together it's something that

00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:47,380
for me works I'm for us for example one

00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:53,230
of the kids to not introduce you by the

00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:55,330
marketing department story instead of

00:14:53,230 --> 00:15:00,000
the eye teeth for example we are very

00:14:55,330 --> 00:15:03,280
good on project development and

00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:06,160
performance on quality then we try to

00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:08,110
introduce in a knot in in a new customer

00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:11,770
for the IT department and not for the

00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:15,900
marketing because we are not focused on

00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:23,820
design and marketing and then we can

00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:30,880
hype for with another agency sorry then

00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:34,180
there is the mythology how can you adapt

00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:37,300
yourself to the client mythology or then

00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:41,980
adapt the mythology of the client to

00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:45,460
yours big in front of a small if you

00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:47,740
have a very very big client with a very

00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:53,410
very close mythology that it's something

00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:55,930
typical here then can be a very a very

00:15:53,410 --> 00:16:00,130
prone for you like for example that

00:15:55,930 --> 00:16:03,280
typical decline that needs documents for

00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:06,310
every change that you need to do or

00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:07,710
everything that you need to change on

00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:09,240
their system

00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:11,910
something like that it's very very hard

00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:16,050
for a small agency because most of the

00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:19,320
day you are you are trying to create new

00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:21,480
documents for them and this is not very

00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:26,100
good for you it can be a little bit full

00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:28,380
because you lose your time on this thing

00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:30,540
and not on on the best that you are that

00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:38,040
are development or performance on Susilo

00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:41,610
did for example for us we have we divide

00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:44,970
our mythology in two different things

00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:48,210
the internal one that it's how we work

00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:52,950
on our office like internal development

00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:55,290
and how can we work or how we work with

00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:59,340
the client for example internally we

00:16:55,290 --> 00:17:01,890
will use agile as mandatory in a small

00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:07,470
teams we divide our teams in two three

00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:10,080
four people and then create user stories

00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:12,570
like that most of you work with agile

00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:17,310
yeah there is something that you don't

00:17:12,570 --> 00:17:20,550
know i jolly yeah okay then organize

00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:24,959
ourselves in two or three weeks Springs

00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:26,880
and as usually and retrospective this is

00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:29,490
very very important for for us for

00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:34,080
example to make a little retrospective

00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:36,150
at the end of every spring to try to to

00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:42,450
focus on the needs that the development

00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:53,040
team in half and then try to to pass to

00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:57,420
the client and I have the say the needs

00:17:53,040 --> 00:18:00,510
the minutes were then hope how we work

00:17:57,420 --> 00:18:05,640
with the with the client we have only

00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:08,520
one person as contact on on the on the

00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:11,730
client or maybe a small set of persons

00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:15,270
because this is very good for us I'm

00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:17,760
very good for them as maybe they don't

00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:20,800
think the same but this is the best one

00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:25,950
because if not you have a meet

00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:28,750
with people that are trying to give his

00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:32,650
his opinion about something that maybe

00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:35,920
it's not the best and we try to usually

00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:38,530
have one person of the client site on

00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:40,990
one person of the IT department of this

00:18:38,530 --> 00:18:45,480
client side and usually it's it's the

00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:48,820
best for us something that is not very

00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:50,410
agile but it's very good for for the

00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:53,500
client try to extract all the

00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:57,880
requirements at the first step of the

00:18:53,500 --> 00:19:00,550
project not at the at the end like on

00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:04,810
average spin we try to excite all of

00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:09,220
them most and then go more in-depth on

00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:12,430
every spring and then we can manage with

00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:15,640
a client all of these kind of things try

00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:18,910
to introduce the client appreciation of

00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:22,180
the of the project something that it's

00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:25,330
very useful for them and make a demo

00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:29,200
meeting at the end of every sprint but

00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:31,540
who could change we as a provider or

00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:37,470
them as a client this is something that

00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:41,320
is a typical question for us for example

00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:43,530
clean usually don't use agile as their

00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:47,410
methodology but we try to introduce

00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:49,840
themselves on our methodology adaptive

00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:52,440
work to use agile don't try to use

00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:55,540
elijah techniques at the beginning of

00:19:52,440 --> 00:20:00,870
the first project try to introduce them

00:19:55,540 --> 00:20:05,950
on every project that you work for them

00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:08,320
and try to to introduce themselves to

00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:12,820
the positive things that they can bring

00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:17,140
with agile and what is the problems that

00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:20,320
you need to to work on them work closely

00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:22,690
with with a client closely with manager

00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:27,220
as a small agency you need to remove all

00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:29,350
the classic layers and done don't try to

00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:31,750
to communicate with a person on the

00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:33,700
client that then needs to communicate to

00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:39,610
the director and this kind of thing sent

00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:42,490
to be as as best as you can with the the

00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:45,030
person that have the decision or the

00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:48,730
final decision on the client side

00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:52,750
replace your personal sales person for a

00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:55,120
technical person because usually is best

00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:56,710
because you only have one person on this

00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:59,080
kind of meetings for example for us

00:20:56,710 --> 00:21:03,580
because we are a very very small agency

00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:06,790
and this is something that it's is the

00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:08,980
rest use plain and direct language to

00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:15,460
communicate with a client don't try to

00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:18,460
to to full or something because if you

00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:21,100
fail on the n1 project gonna on a big

00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:24,040
client as on a small you will lose this

00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:26,920
kind of client usually this type of

00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:30,520
client and don't hide problems and

00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:34,360
benefit you have to be very very clear

00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:36,820
with them and work closely with IT

00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:39,970
department it's something that it's very

00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:45,490
very very important integrate with them

00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:47,740
and try to be a kind of concealer you

00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:50,380
should not be a simple provider because

00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:52,990
they have a lot of provider and they can

00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:55,690
work with a burberry big agencies with

00:21:52,990 --> 00:22:00,100
no problem try to be part of the team

00:21:55,690 --> 00:22:03,070
it's very very very important and what

00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:07,120
about culture and how can the impact to

00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:11,110
your team how can you explain to your to

00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:13,180
your client that you don't war one week

00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:16,240
because you Andrew pecan or calm or

00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:19,180
drove all day it's something very very

00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:24,700
difficult how you explain that you waste

00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:27,250
time on moles or fixing patches for us

00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:30,070
programmable we are very plain and we

00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:33,550
introduce these things at the beginning

00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:37,630
of the new conversations with new

00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:39,840
clients something that we have to be

00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:44,500
very clear at the beginning of our

00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:45,210
feature relation what about project and

00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:49,350
community

00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:51,270
project as Drupal it's a benefit we try

00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:53,429
to introduce that it's a benefit for

00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:57,960
them to improve Drupal as a platform

00:22:53,429 --> 00:23:01,740
because if they pay us for example 2 to

00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:05,159
fix problems in models or patches they

00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:09,149
will be they will have a platform Barry

00:23:05,159 --> 00:23:12,720
shaker and if you do this and another

00:23:09,149 --> 00:23:15,390
client do the same then it's better for

00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:18,090
them because we introduced himself in

00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:19,740
the community too because if they are

00:23:18,090 --> 00:23:22,710
very active on the committee and they

00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:26,010
want to hire as a client and new

00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:29,130
developer for the IT department then a

00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:31,260
drupal developer will be very very

00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:36,840
comfortable to work for a client that

00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:41,039
works for the community and what about

00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:44,070
the impact in your business there is to

00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:46,620
kind of of impact the feelings is the

00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:50,270
first one usually big clients are

00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:53,130
various loan payments what about

00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:58,200
introduce I jalan on payments for

00:23:53,130 --> 00:24:01,799
example we introduced a sprint budgets

00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:04,770
or spring invoices with win boys at the

00:24:01,799 --> 00:24:09,330
end of every spin or any number of a

00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:11,880
sprint because we are doing for example

00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:15,090
11 year or one year and half projects

00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:18,539
and for us and a small agency with an

00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:20,340
invoice anything at the end until the

00:24:18,539 --> 00:24:24,470
end of the project for us it's something

00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:28,770
that will class and what about the team

00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:32,070
because the developers is the core of

00:24:28,770 --> 00:24:35,220
this kind of agencies then if the

00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:38,730
developer is is bored to work with you

00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:41,399
it's something that you that will

00:24:38,730 --> 00:24:45,690
convert in a problem then be careful

00:24:41,399 --> 00:24:48,539
with rotation of clients it's better to

00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:51,630
rotate for example if a developer are

00:24:48,539 --> 00:24:55,570
now finishing a project during a year

00:24:51,630 --> 00:24:58,930
then it's better for you as

00:24:55,570 --> 00:25:01,570
director or project manager to put this

00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:05,470
developer to a very small project or

00:25:01,570 --> 00:25:10,480
maybe to innovation or something like

00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:14,340
that to try to to motivate them try to

00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:17,610
combine week on a small projects and

00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:21,010
motivation is the key involved

00:25:17,610 --> 00:25:23,230
developers on every face maybe four for

00:25:21,010 --> 00:25:29,610
example for me developers are involved

00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:29,610
on on decisions in architecture or in

00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:38,290
analysis or something like this it's

00:25:34,690 --> 00:25:40,660
something very very important and as a

00:25:38,290 --> 00:25:43,330
concert and conclusion suffering this is

00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:48,130
not a to do to follow it's only our side

00:25:43,330 --> 00:25:51,340
try to introduce little steps and you're

00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:53,410
in your team's take care of your team's

00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:56,680
is something that it's the key of your

00:25:53,410 --> 00:25:58,420
agency as a small and humanize the

00:25:56,680 --> 00:26:02,710
relationship with a client try to be

00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:04,990
kind of a friends or something that you

00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:09,760
can't an IT department for me is the

00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:15,090
bear thing to to introduce you more than

00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:19,710
marketing and sorry baby I go very fast

00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:22,710
thank you very much it's my presentation

00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:22,710
questions

00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:36,830
yes yeah and maybe you yep so we had to

00:26:34,679 --> 00:26:42,210
questions and one you were saying

00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:46,260
introduce them to agile slowly yeah how

00:26:42,210 --> 00:26:47,910
do you do that because the big challenge

00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:50,580
we have in agile is getting people to

00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:52,770
get their heads around the shift from

00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:55,710
you have a specification that is what

00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:57,600
you'll get for your money too it isn't

00:26:55,710 --> 00:27:00,870
going to be like that so how do you mean

00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:04,380
by introduce our jewels locate and the

00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:06,870
second question mm-hmm was he said be an

00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:08,340
expert in something they need find out

00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:11,820
what they need be an expert in and one

00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:17,309
of you give some examples okay the first

00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:21,030
one we introduce slowly on Nigel but in

00:27:17,309 --> 00:27:24,120
the client side for example for the

00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:28,400
biggest project that we are doing on the

00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:33,120
first one we only in truce themselves in

00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:38,250
user stories in client then I for myself

00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:40,679
I was the blue owner and then me and the

00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:44,640
client right all the user stories and

00:27:40,679 --> 00:27:46,800
then go to the London team and all these

00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:50,840
things on the second project for example

00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:55,700
I introduce the client to user stories

00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:58,650
testing on of the average sprint and

00:27:55,700 --> 00:28:01,650
appreciation and now that it's because

00:27:58,650 --> 00:28:12,240
want all these things and then choose

00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:15,600
themselves to ya to Sprint's to maybe if

00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:19,790
you want to to do two or three weeks the

00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:24,600
springs for example preciation testing

00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:27,270
and writing tests they write the test on

00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:34,260
the head or something like that for camp

00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:37,380
and the second question was sorry okay

00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:38,160
sorry yeah for example for all things

00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:41,720
that

00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:48,150
we are very focused on code quality and

00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:51,110
how can you create a different kind of

00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:53,910
development with features and and

00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:55,860
continuous integration gate B hat and

00:28:53,910 --> 00:29:00,150
this kind of things we are very expert

00:28:55,860 --> 00:29:02,460
here and spend on that then we focus on

00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:04,470
clients that we think that they need

00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:06,660
this kind of the Ruhlman for example on

00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:09,000
this project I yeah on this project

00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:13,650
unknown this on this client we introduce

00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:17,550
this mythology on their IT department

00:29:13,650 --> 00:29:19,500
and is something that helps us to do

00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:24,060
this project and another project that

00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:26,580
will be on the future sorry yeah you

00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:29,160
need to use the sorry the microphone for

00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:32,070
the recording how do you recommend to

00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:36,320
price and estimate the project well this

00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:42,930
is the big question this is the big okay

00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:47,960
Wow for me and my experience for example

00:29:42,930 --> 00:29:51,620
I try to introduce the agile method of

00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:55,590
create budgets that is something that

00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:59,190
into the client on budget and how can

00:29:55,590 --> 00:30:01,440
you react this but for me for example I

00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:03,890
tried to when I when I have a very very

00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:07,710
big project something that it's very

00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:11,730
seems very usually but for me it's not I

00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:15,360
try to split them on different phases

00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:18,480
and try to focus on very little faces

00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:20,940
and then into this budget only in this

00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:24,420
phase and then I think this is a project

00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:27,810
that usually it's two years project with

00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:31,680
something like two hundred thousand

00:30:27,810 --> 00:30:36,720
euros then try to split them on five or

00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:38,520
temporary of 20,000 euros this most easy

00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:42,510
to manage for you as a small agency

00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:44,110
because you have a set of 10 people on

00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:48,610
your development

00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:50,380
team we can manage two years project and

00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:52,890
then it's better for you as a

00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:57,900
salesperson to manage that plan at

00:30:52,890 --> 00:30:57,900
20,000 project done at twenty-hundred

00:31:01,049 --> 00:31:08,190
it's something of experience for me for

00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:10,660
example if I say I I tried to to

00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:14,710
recognize more or less the

00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:17,559
functionalities then if I make this kind

00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:20,650
of things on the past like Sir John off

00:31:17,559 --> 00:31:24,400
of panels or something like this is okay

00:31:20,650 --> 00:31:27,960
it's on the path I spend on that two

00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:37,510
months then from its mom sorta like this

00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:40,110
for me no questions yeah I am Daniel

00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:43,570
like two questions one is about

00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:45,790
invoicing yep add jolly invoicing sounds

00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:47,919
really interesting so if you could

00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:49,690
elaborate on that both from the

00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:52,500
perspective from the client than you and

00:31:49,690 --> 00:31:55,270
then you talk a little bit about

00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:57,970
introducing the technical guy instead of

00:31:55,270 --> 00:32:00,070
the sales guy yep I am the sales guy and

00:31:57,970 --> 00:32:01,299
not too technical job so it would be

00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:06,540
nice to hear a little bit something

00:32:01,299 --> 00:32:09,340
about that Thanks okay then the jail

00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:12,910
mythology or or invoices for me for

00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:16,750
example if I I split a project on maybe

00:32:12,910 --> 00:32:20,370
I don't know 10 sprints then I in both

00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:24,370
in boys sorry on at the end of every

00:32:20,370 --> 00:32:29,290
pair springs for example 2 4 6 8 and 10

00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:32,230
but after they say that they pass all

00:32:29,290 --> 00:32:35,770
the test plan that they have then when

00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:39,790
for them it's the second or the fourth

00:32:35,770 --> 00:32:42,250
spring is closed then I'm boys these two

00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:44,020
weeks or four weeks or five weeks or

00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:45,940
these kind of things it's better for me

00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:48,640
and it's bad for them because they have

00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:52,720
control of everything that they are

00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:55,820
spending and everything that it's closed

00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:58,930
it's paid and

00:32:55,820 --> 00:33:06,940
and the second was about arcaded the

00:32:58,930 --> 00:33:10,250
salesperson sorry for me is best to have

00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:13,160
technical and not only a salesperson in

00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:17,510
a small agency because in my experience

00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:21,530
I introduce myself on the IT department

00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:27,170
and then they speak a different language

00:33:21,530 --> 00:33:31,550
than marketing one and this they speak

00:33:27,170 --> 00:33:34,700
in technical facts and I'm a technical

00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:38,150
person then it's the communication its

00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:41,750
its birth for me of my or my point of

00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:45,290
view and if it's good your communication

00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:48,200
with a the IT department day as an

00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:50,240
internal department they will go to the

00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:52,880
marketing thing and they introduce

00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:55,070
ourselves that we are a very good

00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:57,830
company or not a very good company and

00:33:55,070 --> 00:34:00,740
it's better but if in your case you have

00:33:57,830 --> 00:34:04,250
a very good person you for example in

00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:06,070
that case on sales and you have a very

00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:09,230
good communication with the marketing

00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:14,620
department is it not a problem this is

00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:19,190
only my point of view and my case sorry

00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:21,980
yeah I am today and I got two questions

00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:23,210
for you so one of them was very

00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:25,340
interesting you were introduced in and

00:34:23,210 --> 00:34:26,870
on this topic from the previous

00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:29,990
questions around how you introduce your

00:34:26,870 --> 00:34:31,640
clients to the use of agile so I

00:34:29,990 --> 00:34:33,290
understand you could kind of convince

00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:34,940
them like now we have this cool format

00:34:33,290 --> 00:34:37,240
was this user story I want to know two

00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:40,330
weeks cycles and get you more involved

00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:43,520
but how we're getting the x in terms of

00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:44,870
deadlines and you know they're they're

00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:47,570
usually fine splitting features

00:34:44,870 --> 00:34:50,810
downloads motorcycles but certain

00:34:47,570 --> 00:34:52,880
clients have very tight requirements in

00:34:50,810 --> 00:34:54,860
terms of I needed by them because I have

00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:57,260
marketing campaigns or my operations are

00:34:54,860 --> 00:35:00,200
all around I don't know game much is for

00:34:57,260 --> 00:35:01,760
example so how do you get them because

00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:03,560
it's very difficult to be able for own

00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,700
projects to actually be able to you know

00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:05,119
create that you're actually going to

00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:08,059
hate that

00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:10,369
date so how do you go around convincing

00:35:08,059 --> 00:35:12,259
them it's all about that Damon your

00:35:10,369 --> 00:35:15,049
question is all updates project okay

00:35:12,259 --> 00:35:17,299
most you have the most valuable items

00:35:15,049 --> 00:35:19,249
while you're asking for on that date you

00:35:17,299 --> 00:35:21,529
cannot guarantee up from 18 months ahead

00:35:19,249 --> 00:35:23,359
that you will have I don't know 200 and

00:35:21,529 --> 00:35:27,140
all requirements so that will be first

00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:28,640
question sorry second question and is

00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:29,990
around I don't know how you will handle

00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:31,640
your projects cuz you mentioned you

00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:33,859
rotate people once they finish the

00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:35,660
project to a different one and I don't

00:35:33,859 --> 00:35:38,329
know if within your business model you

00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:40,160
also ran maintenance on the projects

00:35:38,329 --> 00:35:41,869
that you deliver and whether if you have

00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:43,249
flipped people to different projects

00:35:41,869 --> 00:35:46,819
then how do you handle the maintenance

00:35:43,249 --> 00:35:49,700
requests and support okay the for one

00:35:46,819 --> 00:35:52,009
it's about the date or the project or

00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:55,039
the late fig project this is something

00:35:52,009 --> 00:35:59,630
that it's very difficult for for us a

00:35:55,039 --> 00:36:02,059
small I'm for big I think in in our case

00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:06,170
that we have also this kind of projects

00:36:02,059 --> 00:36:10,880
we try to to manage on the requirement

00:36:06,170 --> 00:36:13,039
part that we try to to be very clear

00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:16,509
that the requirements are very very

00:36:13,039 --> 00:36:18,980
clear and try to introduce the

00:36:16,509 --> 00:36:21,950
development team on this kind of of

00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:24,230
projects because the problems will be

00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:27,319
not on the client side will be usually

00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:29,869
at the development side not because the

00:36:27,319 --> 00:36:33,559
development are not good only for four

00:36:29,869 --> 00:36:37,009
times things and I try to introduce this

00:36:33,559 --> 00:36:39,079
kind of contractors that I omission if

00:36:37,009 --> 00:36:44,329
there is a problem with dates usually I

00:36:39,079 --> 00:36:47,089
use contractors because they don't work

00:36:44,329 --> 00:36:53,259
only on office hours they work usually

00:36:47,089 --> 00:36:56,890
more or they have a little one weapon on

00:36:53,259 --> 00:37:00,170
his part and then try to mix our

00:36:56,890 --> 00:37:03,710
internal team with this kind of

00:37:00,170 --> 00:37:10,369
contractor run and form in my case it

00:37:03,710 --> 00:37:13,940
works and the second was about sorry I'd

00:37:10,369 --> 00:37:15,559
maintains yeah the same team that works

00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:18,440
on the project is the same thing that

00:37:15,559 --> 00:37:19,130
maintains this kind of project we try to

00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:23,150
introduce

00:37:19,130 --> 00:37:24,890
a small projects or different projects

00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:27,860
for the team only for the motivation

00:37:24,890 --> 00:37:33,470
because if you are working for a year

00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:35,480
that you start very very happy but at

00:37:33,470 --> 00:37:38,810
the end of every project you are yeah

00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:42,530
this you are going down then try to

00:37:38,810 --> 00:37:46,430
introduce to to the developers something

00:37:42,530 --> 00:37:49,940
that can be very very good for them but

00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:52,820
the maintenance we need to introduce all

00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:56,810
are not not to introduce other

00:37:52,820 --> 00:38:00,820
developers but in our life cycle we work

00:37:56,810 --> 00:38:05,080
with a code review that there was a

00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:10,460
presentation and with paid 100 000

00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:13,160
developers and for that reason if for

00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:15,620
example there are two people that are

00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:17,960
working on project there is a third one

00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:21,860
that its review this project then if

00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:24,200
there is any problem that this these

00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:26,750
guys can't work on that project then

00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:28,970
there is something one two or three that

00:38:26,750 --> 00:38:31,040
is usually reviewing project and then

00:38:28,970 --> 00:38:33,070
they know or they have the knowledge of

00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:37,580
the project maybe not all of them but

00:38:33,070 --> 00:38:40,160
usually ninety percent then we can

00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:41,900
introduce this team to the project this

00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:44,840
is usually it's something that for for

00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:47,570
as margins is very good try to introduce

00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:50,210
this kind of code review because all the

00:38:47,570 --> 00:38:52,400
knowledge base will be split on all the

00:38:50,210 --> 00:38:55,220
all the teams and not only in one mind

00:38:52,400 --> 00:39:01,640
it's something that for me it's it's

00:38:55,220 --> 00:39:04,880
very very useful sorry no for the

00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:07,100
microphone morning are you using the

00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:10,580
remote contractors and how you manage

00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:13,670
them you know how come home all teams in

00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:19,250
other parts of the globe or just in here

00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:22,750
in Spain our the mythology without know

00:39:19,250 --> 00:39:26,450
the an idol understand employed a

00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:28,760
freelancer from yeah from other parts in

00:39:26,450 --> 00:39:32,750
the world and not only from Spain and

00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:35,030
how if yes no we usually use people from

00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:37,550
from Spain from from Barcelona because

00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:40,730
we have our network very very close

00:39:37,550 --> 00:39:43,760
usually we have one on in London but

00:39:40,730 --> 00:39:47,960
it's we have trust in them because we

00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:54,400
work with them since a lot of years ago

00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:54,400
but your question is about trust or out

00:39:55,600 --> 00:40:05,090
yeah yeah we work on scram we make daily

00:40:00,050 --> 00:40:08,930
every year I every day at honest katya

00:40:05,090 --> 00:40:11,420
on a hangout for in our case and we use

00:40:08,930 --> 00:40:15,070
the same mythology their code is

00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:19,160
reviewed by all the team and the team

00:40:15,070 --> 00:40:21,650
code is reviewed but by this contractor

00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:25,600
there is thus a mythology it's something

00:40:21,650 --> 00:40:30,020
that you can bury the size of your team

00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:32,270
depending on the time and not to be a

00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:35,090
problem for for your finance because if

00:40:32,270 --> 00:40:37,430
you have a very large team then you have

00:40:35,090 --> 00:40:41,560
a finance problem I mean you have a very

00:40:37,430 --> 00:40:43,790
small team then you can't you can have

00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:47,510
more and more and more projects it's

00:40:43,790 --> 00:40:50,750
something that you can do it and we try

00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:53,750
to manage as a team developer as an

00:40:50,750 --> 00:41:00,460
internal developer the same mythology

00:40:53,750 --> 00:41:00,460
and the same the same thing yeah

00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:06,170
I'm working for a quite big company and

00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:09,650
if there's a call a proposal and we want

00:41:06,170 --> 00:41:12,160
to get this client we easily spend like

00:41:09,650 --> 00:41:15,530
40 thousand euros for getting this and

00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:17,600
for a small agency i think it's won't be

00:41:15,530 --> 00:41:20,480
possible you will be broke easily after

00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:26,360
a while so my question is how do you get

00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:29,120
new clients what is the way to not spend

00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:31,820
that much money in proposals for example

00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:35,120
okay as in a small as you can see that

00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:39,320
the problem can be that you can you can

00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:43,610
go to a claim that will be your your end

00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:47,180
it will crush you and to go to new

00:41:43,610 --> 00:41:50,060
planes we spend for example a time from

00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:54,140
the sales department said Superman are

00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:57,050
me and another guy and we try to

00:41:54,140 --> 00:42:01,340
introduce ourselves like meetings and

00:41:57,050 --> 00:42:03,890
something like this and try to start

00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:07,370
with a very small project the first

00:42:03,890 --> 00:42:10,280
project for a client it's not usually a

00:42:07,370 --> 00:42:13,430
big one only because they didn't know

00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:15,680
you and they they don't want to pay a

00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:20,690
lot of money for a small agency that

00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:27,500
they don't know and us as an agency that

00:42:20,690 --> 00:42:30,290
want to to to go ahead on time you don't

00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:33,290
want to to work for the first time with

00:42:30,290 --> 00:42:35,720
a very big project with a claim because

00:42:33,290 --> 00:42:38,690
you don't know where and then try try to

00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:41,090
do these kind of things it's not maybe

00:42:38,690 --> 00:42:47,180
it's as it's a restaurant for a person

00:42:41,090 --> 00:42:49,600
yeah ok so then thank you very much for

00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:49,600
