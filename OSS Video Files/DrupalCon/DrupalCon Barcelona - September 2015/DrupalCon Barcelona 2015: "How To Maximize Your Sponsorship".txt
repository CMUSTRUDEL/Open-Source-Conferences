I'm here now to help you out to

hopefully help you get the most out of

00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:42,660
your sponsorship a lot of you have been

00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:44,550
to pecan sponsors or drupalcamp sponsors

00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:48,270
before so you probably know what to do

00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:51,750
so this is kind of a brief rundown to

00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:54,710
refresh your understanding of what a

00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:57,690
drupalcon really is and hopefully

00:00:54,710 --> 00:01:02,219
prepare you a little bit better for this

00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:04,710
upcoming job back on in Barcelona so

00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:07,290
over the years the people here at the

00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:09,390
drupal association have kind of figured

00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:11,970
out that there's three main reasons why

00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:14,549
people sponsored Rubicon's or why they

00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:17,580
sponsor drupal events in general and

00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:19,740
those three are leads and business

00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:23,250
development so new business or working

00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:25,310
on making your current business

00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:27,810
relationships a little bit stronger

00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:30,770
maybe even networking with other

00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:34,290
businesses for potential partnerships

00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:37,350
talent recruitment drupal is a very

00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:40,770
specific knowledge and skill base so

00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:43,439
what better way to recruit drupal talent

00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:46,259
than at the largest drupal event of the

00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:48,299
year and the third reason is really to

00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:51,119
give back to the community and

00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:53,820
demonstrate thought leadership this

00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:57,439
could be highlighting modules that

00:01:53,820 --> 00:02:01,110
they've created demonstrating your

00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:04,409
proactiveness and growing the project

00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:08,929
and contributing to the project itself

00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:11,730
whether it's accelerating Drupal 8

00:02:08,929 --> 00:02:13,740
maintaining it or even just being a

00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:15,570
sprint mentor rollable training

00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:17,760
mentors there's a lot of things to

00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:20,810
demonstrate and with this being such a

00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:22,950
strong and passionate community base

00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:24,660
sometimes it's important just let you

00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:27,300
know or let people know that you're out

00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:29,100
there helping this community in

00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:33,270
whichever way it is that you want to

00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:35,430
demonstrate so no matter what you're

00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:39,450
doing whatever your goal is out of those

00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:43,160
three there's basically four steps to

00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:46,970
help you succeed at achieving that goal

00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:50,910
this comes down to being proactive

00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:53,100
Drupal con extends way beyond then the

00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:56,400
actual dates so even though it is only a

00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:57,930
Tuesday Wednesday Thursday event you

00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,210
really need to start promoting your

00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:03,330
presence at Drupal weeks maybe even a

00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:06,810
month before and extend a couple weeks

00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:08,730
past drupalcon so whatever it is your

00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:10,620
branding is whatever message you're

00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:12,860
going to try to get across you know

00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:17,310
start early start reaching out to people

00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:19,170
and as always with all things always

00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:22,610
follow up if you are there collecting

00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:25,020
leads follow up with those leads if

00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:27,510
you're done with the event and you want

00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:30,630
to show you know the community what you

00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:34,380
did do it follow up and let people know

00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:36,570
that you were there the second step to

00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:40,620
success is to define your goal and

00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:42,690
message there are going to be a lot of

00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:44,280
Drupal related companies there if you're

00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:46,740
a Drupal shop if you're a hosting

00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:49,470
company if you're an isv you know you

00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:52,200
don't want to get lost in the crowd so

00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:54,690
define your goal what separates you and

00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:56,640
make sure it's consistent a lot of

00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:59,850
companies will create a whole new

00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:03,630
marketing campaign solia based around

00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:05,760
drupalcon whichever it is so this can go

00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:07,830
from your artwork to whatever message

00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:11,880
you are trying to display whether it's

00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:13,830
your a thought leadership or a certain

00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:16,950
product that you want to promote or a

00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:19,320
new merger that you potentially are a

00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:21,299
part of you know defined it beforehand

00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:25,410
promote it beforehand and stay

00:04:21,299 --> 00:04:28,770
consistent and then define track metrics

00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:31,890
for your goals and make sure these are

00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:33,810
measurable you know a good piece of ice

00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:36,419
if you can't measure it you can't manage

00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:38,490
it so you know go in there what is your

00:04:36,419 --> 00:04:42,630
goal a certain amount of leads a certain

00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:44,729
amount of conversations maybe a certain

00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:47,580
amount of sales to happen whoever it is

00:04:44,729 --> 00:04:50,460
that is your goal define it and let your

00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:52,200
entire team know about it and then also

00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:54,180
you know promote it through all channels

00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:57,840
I kind of touch on this earlier

00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:59,669
drupalcon itself is those three days but

00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,500
it's really extends beyond that and

00:04:59,669 --> 00:05:03,419
obviously not everyone's going to be

00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:06,660
attending it so go through your social

00:05:03,419 --> 00:05:09,540
media your blog just your website

00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:11,940
whoever it is that you have promoted and

00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:17,160
continue to promote it before and after

00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:20,160
they've in so going into being proactive

00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:22,650
I kind of touched on this earlier it is

00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:25,890
so important to promote your presence at

00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:29,610
drupalcon or your sponsorship beforehand

00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:33,150
and whatever it is ensure that it is

00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:35,400
consistent so if your are going to talk

00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:37,830
about a certain project or a certain

00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:40,830
product that you are releasing you have

00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:43,350
just released or an idea that you're

00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:45,720
coming up with start promoting it early

00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:47,610
that's why I always ask you how do you

00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:49,770
want your company aim to be listed and

00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:52,440
is there a different logo that you want

00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:55,080
to want me to use to promote on our

00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:58,110
website because if you're jumping around

00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:59,580
you know one logos one color you're

00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:01,380
talking about another message in another

00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:04,110
place people get lost and you really

00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:05,880
become not very memorable you know a

00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:11,150
consistent message or consistent

00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:13,950
branding is its critical and people will

00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:15,900
more likely remember that then some

00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:20,669
other jumbled mess that you may come up

00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:22,169
with and then beforehand connect with

00:06:20,669 --> 00:06:24,570
people connect with your followers

00:06:22,169 --> 00:06:27,390
connect with business opportunities

00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:30,060
clients potential clients whatever it is

00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:31,919
maybe there are plenty of resources out

00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:34,620
there for you to connect with them one

00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:37,020
of them being our community page if

00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:37,350
people when they register they can opt

00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:40,260
in

00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:43,620
make their public profile visible to the

00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:46,440
entire public you can legitimately reach

00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:48,180
out to them set a meeting beforehand if

00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:50,700
you don't have any one specific in mind

00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:53,810
you know use our social media outlets

00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:56,100
everyone's going to follow the drupalcon

00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:59,190
twitter handle there's a hash tags

00:06:56,100 --> 00:07:02,430
there's tuple in general and then

00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:03,600
there's also ddoddo you know let people

00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:05,490
know you're going to be there and if

00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:07,170
they want to contact you if they want to

00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:09,000
meet you while there let them know where

00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:10,710
they can find you whether you had a

00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,780
booth number if you're sponsoring a

00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:15,180
certain event let them know what your

00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:17,870
vin is who you're there or who's going

00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:21,350
to be there and why you're there and

00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:23,280
then during the event this is also

00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:25,170
obviously probably one of the more

00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:27,390
important things because it's the

00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:29,070
drupalcon itself if you're bringing a

00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:32,340
team there make sure everyone looks like

00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:36,140
they are a team you don't have to have a

00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:38,490
uniform per se but let people know or

00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:39,540
have them wear something that lets me

00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:41,280
know where they're coming from

00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:43,050
especially if they're going to be going

00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:45,150
to the social events or they're going to

00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:48,110
be doing the sprints you know it will

00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:50,070
show that this your company is

00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:53,220
contributing they're a part of this

00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:55,590
community and you know their team and it

00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:58,470
your team is doing well as thriving

00:07:55,590 --> 00:08:00,590
people want to join it if you know

00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:03,180
you're out there to recruit people and

00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:05,640
make sure everyone has a business card

00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:07,890
even if they are just a developer and

00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:09,900
business development and sales isn't

00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:11,580
their thing let them have a business

00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:14,460
card and maybe even create a business

00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:16,590
card specifically for this drupalcon

00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:20,570
whatever your goal is whether it's to

00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:23,640
recruit talent generate new leads

00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:25,800
promote a new product have that message

00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:27,870
on that card so even if a business

00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:30,330
developer is talking to another business

00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:32,640
developer they can simply hand him the

00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:35,219
card and the job credentials will be

00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,719
right there it's just nice to have

00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:39,479
everyone on the same page and look

00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:43,410
professional and make the most of

00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:46,020
sending these people there before you

00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:48,540
guys go coach the team on the on the

00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:50,460
message so whoever they are talking to

00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:53,340
you can't obviously

00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:55,230
be around your team the entire time so

00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:56,730
let them know what the message is make

00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:58,710
sure that they are promoting it while

00:08:56,730 --> 00:09:00,690
they're there and maybe give them some

00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:02,610
metrics because again if there's you

00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:06,240
can't measure it you can't really manage

00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:08,130
it have your team tweet and promote it

00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,560
through their channels through your

00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:12,540
company channels the more people you

00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,670
send the larger presence you're going to

00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:17,430
have and then if they themselves can

00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:19,800
reach out through their own channels you

00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:22,080
know the market that you're reaching is

00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:25,500
you know just exponential for the amount

00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:27,420
of people that you bring aside from the

00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:29,730
sessions which are obviously important

00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:32,430
and the exhibit hall attend all the

00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:35,040
other events going on there's the boss a

00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:36,900
bird of feather room which you know it's

00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:39,750
a it's an excellent way to really

00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:41,520
promote your thought leadership within

00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:44,370
the community because these are just

00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:47,040
open conversations and the topics are

00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:48,750
chosen by you guys so you even have the

00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,130
chance to submit a topic yourself

00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:52,830
something you're passionate about or

00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:55,560
just join in on someone else's and you

00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:57,300
know demonstrate that this is an area of

00:09:55,560 --> 00:10:00,600
your expertise or this is something

00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:02,580
you're passionate about join the special

00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,920
events whether it's trivia nights also

00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:10,110
always a popular one there's social

00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:12,390
events happening around Tupac on every

00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:14,700
day of the week before during and after

00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:16,020
the event or maybe even throw one

00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:18,570
yourself it doesn't have to be an

00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:20,880
elaborate party but maybe just a dinner

00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:23,360
inviting people that you want to speak

00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:26,990
to and get to know a little bit better

00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:30,810
you know as always the hallway Trek the

00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:33,360
all-important hallway track just walking

00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:36,360
around this event is venue or even just

00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:38,670
a city itself you know what other chance

00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:42,150
or whether timeframe do you have this

00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:44,730
many people that have this much impact

00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:46,770
on Drupal gathered together you know

00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:48,270
take advantage of that even if you're

00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:50,940
not going to the sessions you're not

00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:52,710
doing anything just talk to people

00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:55,050
network with them out in the hallways

00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:57,300
out in the streets go grab a drink go

00:10:55,050 --> 00:11:01,560
grab a coffee whatever it may be take

00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:04,270
advantage of it and then know how you're

00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:08,080
going to promote your message know how

00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:10,000
you're going to collect leads this time

00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:12,400
around and rubicon Barcelona we will not

00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,260
be providing a lead scanner so come

00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:15,820
prepared and make sure everyone knows

00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:18,480
how they're doing everyone on your team

00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:20,770
knows what the what the game plan is

00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,810
because if one person is collecting

00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:25,840
business card one person is scanning on

00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:29,470
the app one person is just writing it

00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:32,260
down on a napkin I you'll regret that

00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:33,580
when it comes to a week after a couple

00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:35,950
days after the comma you're trying to

00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:37,360
follow up with people just know what the

00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:39,220
game plan is and make sure it's

00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,140
consistent however it is you're going to

00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:44,620
do it so you're not regret anything you

00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:47,200
know you're not wasting time and then

00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:50,170
the all-important after I already touch

00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:54,400
on this but we like to recommend

00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:57,280
following up within 48 hours drupalcon

00:11:54,400 --> 00:12:00,700
is a big deal it's hectic for everyone

00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:03,460
not just you so you know it's important

00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:06,760
to follow up wild on top of everyone's

00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:08,980
mind and if you follow up within 48

00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:10,870
hours you know it shows that this is

00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:13,750
important to you it's not you're not

00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:15,940
just some name and some email and some

00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:18,670
database somewhere make it a personal

00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:20,410
message you know make it represent the

00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:22,690
branding that you were representing

00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:24,220
while you're a Drupal come another

00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:26,050
little piece of advice create this

00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:29,620
message before you go because as I

00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:30,880
mentioned it's a crazy event so last

00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:33,760
thing you're going to want to do is

00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:36,730
create an email or create a follow-up

00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:38,440
after all this traveling after it's all

00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:41,410
said and done so maybe have it prepared

00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:42,790
before you done before you get there so

00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:45,910
when it's over it's a simple click of

00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:49,780
the button or you know wave of the one

00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:51,850
whatever you want to call it all right

00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:53,830
so as mentioned before we typically find

00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:57,970
that there are the three reasons why

00:12:53,830 --> 00:13:00,850
people sponsored Rubicon and so now I'm

00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:04,840
going to break down each one keep it in

00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:06,550
mind those four tips of success so first

00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:08,740
thing i want to touch into is lead

00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:14,410
generation so this is for new business

00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:17,140
or new clients this goes into being

00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:18,180
proactive so know who's going to be

00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:22,240
there

00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:24,670
review the kindy profile I mentioned

00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:26,890
before you can contact them directly you

00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:29,170
can scroll through see who it is you

00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:31,800
want to talk and simply through the

00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:34,840
drupalcon website you can contact them

00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:36,760
what easier way is there to do that so

00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:38,350
while you're there you know you want to

00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:39,970
talk to so you're not wasting time

00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:43,000
trying to figure out oh is this where I

00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:47,110
want to talk to no yes so do it

00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:48,790
beforehand and you know this will kind

00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:51,880
of go into the quality over quantity

00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:54,790
yeah it's one thing to just get a list

00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:58,600
of a thousand names but in my personal

00:13:54,790 --> 00:14:01,330
opinion five solid leads is always going

00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:03,520
to be better than 20 garbage leads so

00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:05,110
know who you want to reach out to or at

00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:07,450
least know the type of people you want

00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:10,840
to speak to beforehand and on a side

00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:15,430
note this community page it's it's

00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:17,560
pretty important to do pecans for a lot

00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:20,470
of people so don't take advantage of it

00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:22,990
don't spam don't use web crawlers you'll

00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:25,510
get a bad rap will get a bad rap so it's

00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:27,220
really not good for everyone so be

00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:31,950
considerate when you are using it and

00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:31,950
use it for you know specific reasons

00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:39,030
also what I touch on if you are there to

00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:42,670
generate leads or generate new business

00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:46,120
let your team know how many are you

00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:48,760
going after whether it's sales meetings

00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:50,650
just general conversations how many

00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:52,870
business cards you hand out or how many

00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:56,140
business cards you want to collect you

00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:57,970
should have a number in mind and your

00:14:56,140 --> 00:15:00,010
team should know what number you have in

00:14:57,970 --> 00:15:01,810
mind because again I'm going to say it

00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:04,960
again without any metrics you can't

00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:14,530
manage it so come prepared with a goal

00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:18,150
and a measurable goal um the other part

00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:21,070
of lead generation for new business is

00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:22,870
you know doing it outside of your booth

00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:24,610
if you are a booth sponsor it's

00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:27,070
important to always have someone there

00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:30,100
at the booth collecting leads that way

00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:31,360
because there's like the classic I enter

00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:34,510
to win

00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:37,230
and you can win this TV but in return we

00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:41,620
get you as a lead where you can find the

00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:44,709
more qualified leads and really take

00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:46,899
some time to evaluate who you want to

00:15:44,709 --> 00:15:49,060
talk to is outside the exhibit hall so I

00:15:46,899 --> 00:15:52,209
mentioned before at in boss just network

00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:56,560
in general talk to other like-minded

00:15:52,209 --> 00:15:58,959
people attend these social events this

00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:00,970
is where you can get the most qualified

00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:03,700
leads even if you don't have them

00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:05,320
scanned in a database you at least made

00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:09,279
that connection and you've networked

00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:11,940
with them and in return you have become

00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:14,230
remember or memorable to them as well

00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:16,720
another thing I'd like to mention so we

00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:20,160
will be having again as always a VIP

00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:23,079
sponsor support appreciation happy hour

00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:27,130
this will be happening wednesday of 23rd

00:16:23,079 --> 00:16:30,399
of sep tember from 17 to 18 30 it will

00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:33,100
be there right at the CCI be level to

00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:37,000
terrorists as that so conveniently

00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:38,610
mentions this is really a good

00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,470
opportunity to do some high-level

00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:43,660
networking each company all the sponsors

this is going to be the high-level

00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:56,620
executive type account managers just

00:16:53,339 --> 00:16:59,350
VIPs as it says in the title so if you

00:16:56,620 --> 00:17:02,019
want to do some high-level networking

00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:03,490
potentially talk you know

00:17:02,019 --> 00:17:05,350
business-to-business maybe some

00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:08,370
partnerships attend this it's important

00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:10,780
and it's fun there'll be drinks food and

00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:13,179
you really don't have to do anything but

00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:15,100
walk up a couple stairs so might as well

00:17:13,179 --> 00:17:18,540
attend so again send me the emails of

00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:18,540
the attendees if you haven't already

00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:26,260
another part of lead generation is

00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:28,660
moving people are moving business down

00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:30,910
the pipeline of people you've already

00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:33,100
been in touch with people or you were

00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:34,900
not able to close a deal or close

00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:39,790
business in the past now's your chance

00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:41,620
to reach back out with them I mean like

00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:43,720
it says right there drupalcon is a sales

00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:44,700
tool so if you've lost a lead if you

00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:47,300
have we

00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:49,770
needs active right now let them know

00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:52,560
that you're going to be there let them

00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:55,110
know where to find you and really

00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:57,540
explain that client flirt footprint you

00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:58,700
know there's no better impression or no

00:17:57,540 --> 00:18:03,330
better way to make a good impression

00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:05,340
than to be with them in person yeah

00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:07,320
webinars are great phone calls are good

00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:09,420
but just to be there in person having

00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:12,870
the face-to-face time in a social

00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:14,700
situation take advantage of it and even

00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:16,620
if you don't close it right then in

00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:19,020
there you know follow up with it later

00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:22,980
it's just a good way to spark up a loss

00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:27,810
lead or to help a-active lead move move

00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:30,510
and further down the pipeline other some

00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:32,940
ways to do this specifically invite them

00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:35,070
to your session if one of your employees

00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:37,710
has a session and you want to promote

00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:40,890
that you you're proud of it tell them to

00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:44,010
go to their it's a good way to get down

00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:45,870
to the technical aspects of it from the

00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:49,470
people that are the most knowledgeable

00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:51,810
at it host a personal dinner whether

00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:53,400
it's a larger dinner with a couple

00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:56,520
different clients or just a one-on-one

00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:58,230
meeting outside take advantage of the

00:18:56,520 --> 00:19:01,110
scenery how often are you going to be

00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:03,330
able to meet with clients in a cool area

00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:04,770
such as Barcelona if you're numb from

00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:06,860
Barcelona if you're from the United

00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:10,860
States other elsewhere in Europe Asia

00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:14,550
you know this is a perfect setting to

00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:18,780
have a more intimate meeting you know

00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:23,010
take advantage of it and then send out

00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:25,440
newsletters blogs or or or tweets

00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:27,720
through your social media this is a good

00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:30,840
way to really just take the shotgun

00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:33,030
approach and let multiple people know at

00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:34,350
once that you're going to be there let

00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:36,540
them know where you're going to be at if

00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:38,280
you're going to be a tab off and it kind

00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:39,930
of filters out the people for you

00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:42,360
because then you know the people that

00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:44,310
are attending are the people that want

00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:48,470
to see you or want to hear what you have

00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:52,380
to say so it's a good way to you know

00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:55,350
proactively move people down this

00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:57,480
pipeline without having to put a lot of

00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:58,360
specific time and effort because if

00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:01,570
they're attend

00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:03,550
they bought that you said that you're

00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:05,230
going to be at that effectively is

00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:09,040
moving them down the pipeline right

00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:13,030
there the last part of lead generation

00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:18,010
is a partnership so this is when we're

00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:21,540
talking about business partnerships you

00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:25,750
know whether it's you have a specific

00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:27,280
module product that or expertise that

00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:29,320
you want to team up with someone and go

00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:30,850
to market with them with or you want to

00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:32,980
team up with a company so you can

00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:37,300
capture a new market or capture a new

00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:40,060
audience this happens a lot at rubicon

00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:43,200
and a lot of people take it do this or a

00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:46,300
sponsor drupalcon solely for this reason

00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:50,740
most of you know that mergers are a very

00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:53,650
large aspect of the Drupal ecosystem

00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:57,340
right now and many of them have started

00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:59,920
here so as I've mentioned before this is

00:20:57,340 --> 00:21:01,930
you rarely have this opportunity to have

00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:04,660
this many influential people and

00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:06,640
companies gathered up together for this

00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:09,700
long so if there's something that you

00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:12,730
have in mind you know now is the time to

00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:14,620
get the conversation started or move the

00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:16,690
conversation further if it's already

00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:18,550
been started this is especially

00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:22,300
important when you want to start setting

00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:24,370
these meetings and fans I business

00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:27,250
partnerships are not a small deal it's

00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:29,380
not a lead so you want to know who you

00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:31,510
want to talk to and you obviously want

00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:34,630
to have it in mind before you show up

00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:36,580
and the all-important follow up with it

00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:40,030
because this is could be a very very

00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:41,710
large deal and this goes into if you're

00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:43,860
going to have a booth make sure there's

00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:46,210
someone else out there you know

00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:48,370
experiencing the hallway track you know

00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:50,500
whether it's they themselves or walking

00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:51,880
around the eggs of all going to parties

00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:54,480
going to Bob's going to sessions

00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:56,680
whatever it may be if you're looking for

00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:59,590
potential partnerships you need this

00:21:56,680 --> 00:22:03,100
more personal approach this 101 talk

00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:05,440
rather than a simple booth visit so make

00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:07,710
sure someone's there as well as well as

00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,710
the booth

00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:13,650
reason why people sponsored Rubicon is

00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:15,780
for talent recruitment this one is a

00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:18,690
little bit more straightforward but a

00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:22,350
couple pieces of advice that we have

00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:26,300
found helpful for people is if you're

00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:29,910
hiring let people know a lot of people

00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:31,800
will attend Rubicon to look for a job so

00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:32,880
they may not be a part of a company or

00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:35,250
their part of company and they're

00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:38,790
looking for a new career path or new

00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:42,210
direction so the easier it is for them

00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:44,790
to find you the better it could be as

00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:48,330
Blaine as saying we're hiring with a

00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:49,860
giant sign print out job posting so

00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:52,020
people don't forget about you if

00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:56,309
someone's interested hand them a job

00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:58,350
posting it's a lot easier than relying

00:22:56,309 --> 00:23:01,260
on them to go back to check your website

00:22:58,350 --> 00:23:04,530
later on so you know make it easy for

00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:07,110
them and again set meetings in advance

00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:09,900
if you see someone with a certain skill

00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:12,570
set or talent level that you're looking

00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:16,080
for let them know that you are looking

00:23:12,570 --> 00:23:17,730
for it lets the person know that you

00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:20,130
know this company is different they are

00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:21,809
seeking me out maybe this is something I

00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:24,540
should consider even if they aren't

00:23:21,809 --> 00:23:27,390
considering or looking for a new job you

00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:31,260
know if you are proactive in that sense

00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:33,179
it sets an impression with them if you

00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:36,690
aren't aware we have the Drupal jobs

00:23:33,179 --> 00:23:39,809
board I've sent all of you guys a job

00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:42,690
postings to there this is a great tool

00:23:39,809 --> 00:23:46,260
and as part of your sponsorship you get

00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:48,030
free postings these do expires but this

00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:51,150
is a perfect chance to sort of

00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:54,270
experiment with it and obviously if

00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:57,720
someone's a drupal developer or a Drupal

00:23:54,270 --> 00:24:00,210
talent if you type in duple jobs in your

00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:01,650
search engine drupal job board is going

00:24:00,210 --> 00:24:03,420
to show up first so it's a great tool

00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:04,890
great resource and I hope all of you

00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:08,280
take advantage of it if this is what

00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:11,520
you're looking for and as mentioned

00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:13,760
before if you are hiring make sure the

00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:16,800
branding is consistent across all

00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:19,140
outlets so this example here is the

00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:21,480
business cards if you're hiring and a

00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:22,320
business developer is talking to another

00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:25,830
business if I

00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:28,259
for who or sorry drupal developer who's

00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:31,889
talking to another drupal developer who

00:24:28,259 --> 00:24:34,320
sees a certain skill level that you know

00:24:31,889 --> 00:24:36,750
the company may need give them the

00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:39,350
resource or the tool to recruit them a

00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:42,630
simple business card with a job

00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:44,850
description on it will suffice so give

00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:46,649
everyone their or give your entire team

00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:48,509
the resources and tools to recruit

00:24:46,649 --> 00:24:50,639
because the more people you have out

00:24:48,509 --> 00:24:55,370
there recruiting the more effective it's

00:24:50,639 --> 00:24:58,919
going to be and then instead of just

00:24:55,370 --> 00:25:00,240
promoting the specific job whether it's

00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:03,570
oh we're looking for this many years

00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:06,179
this skill set yeah that's important in

00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:09,600
all and so is pay obviously but a lot of

00:25:06,179 --> 00:25:12,809
people especially in the Drupal world or

00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:16,350
in the tech world want to know why they

00:25:12,809 --> 00:25:18,090
or will have a reason why they join a

00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:20,940
company and a lot of this has to do with

00:25:18,090 --> 00:25:22,590
the company culture so promote this

00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:24,750
culture even if you're not talking to

00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:27,710
the person directly just promote it

00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:30,049
through your channels social media blog

00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:33,330
promote it through how you guys interact

00:25:30,049 --> 00:25:36,570
while you're at drupalcon you know if

00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:38,940
people are wearing your branded shirt or

00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:41,370
your branded gear and they're actively

00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:43,169
talking about your company that will

00:25:41,370 --> 00:25:44,970
show people that they are proud and they

00:25:43,169 --> 00:25:46,889
are happy to be a part of your company

00:25:44,970 --> 00:25:50,370
and that could be the difference-maker

00:25:46,889 --> 00:25:52,320
why people choose to work for you or why

00:25:50,370 --> 00:25:55,200
people begin to seek you out because

00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:57,059
they see that this culture is there the

00:25:55,200 --> 00:26:01,710
team is strong they'll want to join it

00:25:57,059 --> 00:26:04,110
so you know it's important that yeah you

00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:06,929
you do get to the nitty-gritty stuff of

00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:12,450
the job but go beyond that and show why

00:26:06,929 --> 00:26:15,480
your company is so great to work for the

00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:17,009
last reason why people sponsorship this

00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:19,169
there may be other reasons but from

00:26:17,009 --> 00:26:21,360
always seen the last reason why people

00:26:19,169 --> 00:26:23,549
want to sponsor drew pecans and drupal

00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:26,850
camps it's just to give back to the

00:26:23,549 --> 00:26:29,370
community and just to demonstrate their

00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:33,270
leadership throughout this giant

00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:35,340
community Drupal has

00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:37,710
opened up a lot of doors for a lot of

00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:39,600
people it's made a lot of company

00:26:37,710 --> 00:26:42,600
successful it's made people money and

00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:46,310
people like to give back to this because

00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:49,230
they realize how great it is how great

00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:50,970

friends are all have all been created

00:26:54,540 --> 00:27:00,810
through this so people like to give back

00:26:56,610 --> 00:27:04,440
to and people like to lead it and you

00:27:00,810 --> 00:27:05,700
know have some say into it so if this is

00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:09,770
what you want to demonstrate demonstrate

00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:12,420
it in your messaging you know

00:27:09,770 --> 00:27:15,930
demonstrate the sort of trainings you've

00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:17,670
done outside of drupalcon demonstrate

00:27:15,930 --> 00:27:22,380
the modules that you've been

00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:24,390
contributing sprint all the sprints that

00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:27,240
your team members have been doing all

00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:31,350
the contribute contributions your team

00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:34,140
has made and you know the fact that your

00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:36,540
sponsor itself shows that you're

00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:39,450
financially supporting the Drupal

00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:41,120
community the drupal association so be

00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:44,690
proud of it and let people know that

00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:47,430
yeah it's it's one thing to be here to

00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:50,220
for business purposes but that's not

00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:53,900
really why I'm here I'm here to sponsor

00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:57,120
to have fun to give back and really

00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:59,460
change the direction or influence the

00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:02,450
direction that this Drupal project is

00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:05,280
heading and let everyone know about it

00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:08,100
if you're doing this again you're only

00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:09,810
reaching a small tiny portion of the

00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:12,150
Drupal community out of all the

00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:14,040
attendees so continue to promote this

00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:17,190
whether it's just hey we're here at

00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:18,720
Triple Khan it's fun and promote it

00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:20,640
through all your media outlets it's a

00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:22,590
good way to let people know who aren't

00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:27,200
there that you are supporting it that

00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:29,100
you ra ra ra thought leader and

00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:30,240
obviously one of the more important

00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:33,120
things if you really want to just

00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:36,960
contribute is join the sprints whether

00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:40,370
it's you or your team members that's the

00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:45,690
best way to directly contribute to the

00:28:40,370 --> 00:28:47,210
project itself this is where issues get

00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:49,890
taken care of

00:28:47,210 --> 00:28:52,740
people can just sit there and

00:28:49,890 --> 00:28:56,610
collaborate person to person it's fun

00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:58,590
it's effective and if you're going to be

00:28:56,610 --> 00:29:00,990
there where some branded gear not that

00:28:58,590 --> 00:29:01,920
won't hurt to show off that hey I'm part

00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:03,870
of this company and we're all

00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:06,600
contributing maybe you even consider

00:29:03,870 --> 00:29:09,510
being a sprint mentor our our sprint

00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:11,460
mint or base is amazing Cathy phase will

00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:15,470
lead that so if you're interested

00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:18,360
contact her and you know join the club

00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:19,740
join trivia night this is just a fun way

00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:22,710
to be a part of it if you haven't done

00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:25,860
trivia night it's blast a lot of people

00:29:22,710 --> 00:29:28,860
attended again where your branding

00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:32,040
because especially if your team wins not

00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:33,750
saying that bragging is all important

00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:35,940
but if your team wins new happen to be

00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:39,630
wearing your brandy gear you know won't

00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:41,250
hurt there's a lot going on so just make

00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:44,220
sure you're attending everything I

00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:46,320
mentioned before drupalcon extends way

00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:49,620
beyond the actual event the three days

00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:54,390
itself so be involved get involved talk

00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:56,100
with people network and that's that's

00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:59,460
probably the best way to show that you

00:29:56,100 --> 00:30:04,650
are involved in this community and your

00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:06,860
you care about where it's headed so

00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:09,450
again this was a pretty basic

00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:12,030
presentation a lot of you guys do

00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:15,000
already know all this stuff but

00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:16,620
sometimes it's nice to just get a

00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:19,590
refresher especially with it right

00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:22,110
around the corner here so this slide I

00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:23,820
didn't create this slide but I always

00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:26,040
feel like it's pretty helpful just a

00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:28,410
quick rundown you know networking 101

00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:30,090
bring brit bring plenty of business

00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:32,550
cards make sure everyone on your team

00:30:30,090 --> 00:30:35,040
has those business cards and it's

00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:37,890
consistent with ever whatever message it

00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:39,360
you're doing you know prepare prepare an

00:30:37,890 --> 00:30:43,170
elevator pitch a lot of people on your

00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:45,420
team may not be within sales or within

00:30:43,170 --> 00:30:47,220
business development so let them know

00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:49,590
you know this is the message we're going

00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:54,570
for if you see some of that is

00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:57,450
interested here talk about this and you

00:30:54,570 --> 00:31:00,000
know branch out avoid just gravitating

00:30:57,450 --> 00:31:02,790
to people you know

00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:05,180
you don't want to get there have all

00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:07,530
this time go by and then come out of it

00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:09,840
realizing you really didn't achieve you

00:31:07,530 --> 00:31:12,510
don't really meet anyone so try to meet

00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:14,880
new people no better way than to attend

00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:18,360
these extracurricular activities going

00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:21,450
on if you're shy and if you're attending

00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:24,390
this by yourself if you are bringing

00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:27,390
people that you know aren't really part

00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:29,640
of the community yet try just into it's

00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:32,940
as simple as just saying hey haven't met

00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:34,620
you net my name is Tim that's perfect

00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:37,020
way to get a conversation started don't

00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:39,320
be shy the Drupal community are some of

00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:41,430
the most friendly people around I'm

00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:44,070
relatively new and I feel like I've been

00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:46,500
welcomed in and I've taken this line

00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:50,250
word for word and it is worried so don't

00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:54,060
be shy meets new people take advantage

00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:56,010
of this time if you see someone who is

00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:58,620
not taking advantage you know who are

00:31:56,010 --> 00:32:01,010
Horace being shy help them open up you

00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:04,160
know you don't know this person could be

00:32:01,010 --> 00:32:06,690
your next employee this person could be

00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:08,160
part of your next business deal this

00:32:06,690 --> 00:32:09,870
person could be part of your next

00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:14,460
business partnership or you could just

00:32:09,870 --> 00:32:16,500
become a good friend so be courageous

00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:18,540
and reach out to them if you see them

00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:20,790
struggling if you see them being shy

00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:22,710
this is a community for everyone the

00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:26,370
more people we have in it the stronger

00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:28,200
the project gets so don't don't shy away

00:32:26,370 --> 00:32:33,260
from reaching out to the people that are

00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:37,550
keeping to themselves and don't really

00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:42,900
try to sell as anything instead of

00:32:37,550 --> 00:32:45,330
really just building a relationship this

00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:47,970
is your time to meet people to to build

00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:49,800
our initial relationship go on with this

00:32:47,970 --> 00:32:53,130
selling later on there's nothing worse

00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:55,200
than you know having that leaving a bad

00:32:53,130 --> 00:32:57,660
taste in someone's mouth because all

00:32:55,200 --> 00:33:00,990
they were doing was pushing something on

00:32:57,660 --> 00:33:03,690
them people become uncomfortable people

00:33:00,990 --> 00:33:06,750
will stop visiting you they will

00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:09,240
gravitate away from you so use this

00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:11,520
opportunity to really build a

00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:12,990
relationship and then work on the sales

00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:13,470
later on if that's something your

00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:18,440
interest

00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:21,450
it on I please don't be dropping random

00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:24,090
marketing material or the ICO like to

00:33:21,450 --> 00:33:26,700
call it guerrilla marketing first of all

00:33:24,090 --> 00:33:28,590
we may have to pay a fee if you're doing

00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:31,980
in the wrong places is trashy your

00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:34,200
company looks bad so just just a void

00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:37,679
any of this guerrilla warfare marketing

00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:39,510
tactics and if you're giving someone

00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:42,000
your business card or if you're making

00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:45,270
the connection be memorable if you just

00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:47,490
simply write a hand note on your code or

00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:51,059
on your card or on whatever it is you're

00:33:47,490 --> 00:33:54,120
doing it people will be more inclined to

00:33:51,059 --> 00:33:55,919
keep it and follow up with it and you in

00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:58,020
turn will become more memorable so if

00:33:55,919 --> 00:34:01,080
you're hiring someone just say you know

00:33:58,020 --> 00:34:04,620
we'll know like how you had this certain

00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:06,570
skill set right there you know that will

00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:12,300
stick in people's mind and people won't

00:34:06,570 --> 00:34:15,090
want to go home and throw that away so

00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:17,220
just to recap we kind of just did in the

00:34:15,090 --> 00:34:22,159
last one but whatever your goal is be

00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:24,419
proactive start early follow up after

00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:26,429
define your golden message and be

00:34:24,419 --> 00:34:28,889
consistent wherever it is whatever

00:34:26,429 --> 00:34:31,260
outlet you are branding yourself through

00:34:28,889 --> 00:34:33,149
be consistent whether it's creating your

00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:36,570
own little marketing campaign around it

00:34:33,149 --> 00:34:38,879
or it's just your same message that you

00:34:36,570 --> 00:34:41,399
always do be consistent and define it

00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:44,310
and make it measurable it's also a

00:34:41,399 --> 00:34:47,429
two-key promote it through all channels

00:34:44,310 --> 00:34:49,440
and to find your metrics and let your

00:34:47,429 --> 00:34:52,230
entire team know what the metrics are

00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:55,470
because more people you have trying to

00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:58,859
achieve the same goal the quicker and

00:34:55,470 --> 00:35:01,650
