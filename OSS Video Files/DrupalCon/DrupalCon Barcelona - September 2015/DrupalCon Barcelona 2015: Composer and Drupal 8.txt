Title: DrupalCon Barcelona 2015: Composer and Drupal 8
Publication date: 2015-09-22
Playlist: DrupalCon Barcelona - September 2015
Description: 
	We got the island and introduced a lot of new dependencies during the Drupal 8 development cycle. But we did not embrace composer as first class citizen in our development toolchain. Because we have still very important issues to solve. This talk summarizes important issues which block the wider composer adoption related to Packaging, Testing, Subtree split and Drupal.org infrastructure.

And we would like to talk about how we integrate Drupal Packagist in d.o or abandon it completely because we adpot SemVer in contrib.
