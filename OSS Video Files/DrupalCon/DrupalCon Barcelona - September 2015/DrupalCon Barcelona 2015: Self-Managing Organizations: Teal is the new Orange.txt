Title: DrupalCon Barcelona 2015: Self-Managing Organizations: Teal is the new Orange
Publication date: 2015-09-22
Playlist: DrupalCon Barcelona - September 2015
Description: 
	Liip today is green. With that we are not only referring to its logo or the fact that we try to travel by train and compensate our energy consumption, we are also considered “green” based on the definition of Frederic Laloux author of Reinventing Organizations. This means we have moved on from an “orange” organization entirely focused on innovation to one focused on empowerment and values-driven culture. In this talk we will discuss a bit our transformation, our learnings as we have grown from a fusion of two small companies totaling less than 20 to over 100 co-workers over an eight year period. Along the way we had to answer many questions, like how to deal with offices with 20+ people, how to retain our culture as we add new offices, how to adapt management, how not to add middle management and why this even matters, how to deal with people leaving, how to collaborate with the open source world. We will also discuss the very early state of discussion moving towards becoming a “teal” organization, which would require evolving towards full self-management.

About Liip: Has won several prizes for both technical achievements as well as its committment to sustainability (kununu.com, prix egalité, ZKB sustainability award). It has managed its growth entirely organically without any outside investments. All surplus earnings are reinvested into the company or paid out as additional salaries.

	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:08,069
okay let's start today's talk the

00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:10,260
elaborate title teal is the new orange

00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:13,590
not sure how many people know black is

00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:15,690
the new orange TV series pun on that but

00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:18,869
more importantly this talk is about self

00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:21,359
managing organizations and to me this is

00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:23,820
a really exciting opportunity to talk

00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:26,010
about this it's also a lot of pressure

00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,810
not only because I want to please the

00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:30,000
audience here but I also feel a lot of

00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:31,859
pressure that I properly represent or we

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,250
both probably represent all the leapers

00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:37,860
at home who you know who really make up

00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:40,620
bleep and obviously have a big say and

00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:43,140
what leap is you know so without further

00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:46,050
ado let's start briefly introducing

00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:50,250
myself I'm Lucas I've been with leap

00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:54,030
since its second year a partner in since

00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:56,039
2012 and still very much a developer at

00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:58,949
heart so I'm actually still part of a

00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:01,500
development team as well so I'm only

00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:04,500
like part-time in management tasks and

00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:06,689
part-time and developer mostly sort of

00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:09,240
my management tasks is internal

00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:11,250
infrastructure as well as internal

00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:12,689
communications and actually to some

00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:16,110
degree also communication to the outside

00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:22,350
especially to the open source world yeah

00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:24,659
so yes I hope this all often on stage

00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:27,570
will go good during the presentation I

00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:30,840
have a pretty similar history like Lucas

00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:33,689
regarding leap I joined some years ago

00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:36,600
I'm also partner I also have operational

00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:39,600
role I'm a scrum product owner in one of

00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:42,150
our Drupal teams my partner focus area

00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:47,880
is more regarding business conception

00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:50,360
and consulting alright so what are we

00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:53,100
talking about today

00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:54,960
let's maybe fit some baselines or some

00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:57,689
goals for this talk so the goal of this

00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:00,409
talk is to have you walk out of this

00:01:57,689 --> 00:02:02,310
room thinking that yes this is possible

00:02:00,409 --> 00:02:05,460
self-organization is possible it's

00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:07,649
achievable that you also come back go

00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:10,229
home with an idea of some of the pros in

00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:11,790
the cons of going to self-organization

00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:13,830
and to give you some real-world examples

00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:16,410
how an organization can

00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:18,480
morph itself step-by-step to

00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:20,690
self-organization and the last but not

00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,770
least it also that if you try

00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:24,900
self-organization realize that you're

00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:26,580
not alone like this is not just a

00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:28,680
singular island out there there are more

00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:31,380
companies that are doing this there are

00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:36,330
people doing research on this so this is

00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:39,120
not some esoteric unreal utopia what's

00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:41,130
not the goal of this talk is to make you

00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,900
think that there's a silver bullet to

00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:46,980
making your organization so itself

00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:50,040
organized and also we don't want to give

00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:52,080
the the idea that self-organization is

00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:54,990
this the be-all end-all for all

00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,400
organizations there's some really

00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:58,650
important characteristics about the

00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,310
industry that we are in but probably you

00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:05,040
are also in that make it possible to do

00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:06,690
self-organization so why why could this

00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:09,780
talk be of interest of you so this is

00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:11,520
hopefully we get this right so the first

00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:14,090
thing is that we have a sense that

00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:17,000
especially within creative industries

00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:19,650
there is a search for a better

00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,140
organizational structures because people

00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:24,600
in these organizational structures today

00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:26,250
feel that their skills and their

00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:30,300
passions are not really leveraged to the

00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:32,550
fullest extent that we also feel that

00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:34,910
we've already done this we've we are we

00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:37,650
are going through this since many years

00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:39,989
getting closer and closer to what we

00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:42,480
would define as self organize and then

00:03:39,989 --> 00:03:44,580
finally we're we're not an exclusively

00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:47,160
Drupal company but Drupal is a very

00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:48,780
significant part of our business so most

00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:51,480
likely since you know we have at least

00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:53,580
that in common it seems there's a good

00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:55,410
chance that we have that in common and

00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:58,640
therefore what we're going to talk about

00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:58,640
might be relevant to you

00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:04,140
so before we deep dive into this topic

00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:06,630
we just give you a short overview with

00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:07,489
leap is they are my guys that never

00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:11,730
heard of us

00:04:07,489 --> 00:04:14,489
we are nowadays pretty standard

00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:16,650
full-service development company we have

00:04:14,489 --> 00:04:20,310
our roots deep down in PHP development

00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:24,750
that's why development still is very big

00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:26,000
part of our revenues we develop lots of

00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:28,850
stuff and we're mobile

00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:33,020
nice websites powerful business apps you

00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:36,440
might know that but some more hard facts

00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:39,410
we are based in Switzerland we are there

00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:42,170
in five locations the company is owned

00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:44,180
by the leapers so lots of leapers within

00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:46,220
the company have shares nobody outside

00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:47,990
the company has shares everybody that

00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:51,800
wants to leave the company needs to give

00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:55,970
them back at the moment we are 113 of us

00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:58,940
there are some Prentice interns in

00:04:55,970 --> 00:05:02,750
addition to that the management aware we

00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:04,730
two guys are from we are six persons the

00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:07,160
whole company just has at the moment

00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:09,440
some sort of one level hierarchy so it's

00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:14,150
a six and nobody else that has any

00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:16,040
managing role the company exists in 2007

00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:19,010
there was a merger between two small

00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:21,440
companies now to give you even more hard

00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:23,480
facts that's kind of the history since

00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:27,140
the merger so this company started with

00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:29,600
17 persons looks like a pretty

00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:34,280
sustainable growth you will see this

00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:36,350
table later on and presentation so what

00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:38,060
is our dedication since the route since

00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:40,850
the very beginning we are very dedicated

00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:42,919
to open source and open standards that's

00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:45,470
maybe also a reason why we stand here

00:05:42,919 --> 00:05:47,540
today you see pretty lots of our people

00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:52,460
in PHP and open source related

00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:56,380
conferences we love agility since 2008

00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:59,270
we perform 100% of our projects in scrum

00:05:56,380 --> 00:06:01,610
we are very people centric not just

00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:04,340
meaning our own people or our we a

00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:07,610
sleeper but also clients we give a lot

00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:08,960
in relationships and we really care for

00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:11,810
the environment socially and

00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:14,030
ecologically so the guys that came down

00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:17,240
here to Barcelona the guys that took the

00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:21,169
plane they was not paid by leap the guys

00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:23,390
I took the train that was paid by Lee so

00:06:21,169 --> 00:06:25,400
the challenge of our business you might

00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:27,919
know them very well since you might are

00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:30,950
in the same area we have a super fast

00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:32,900
growing market lots of industries demand

00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:36,229
for web and mobile services more and

00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:37,050
more and we have a super fast changing

00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:40,830
market

00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:44,190
new technologies new industries coming

00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:46,620
in new competitors arising and for us

00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:48,960
it's always a channel at least in

00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:52,620
Switzerland to find good qualified and

00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:55,409
motivated leapers it's also not easy to

00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:58,139
acquire clients that have a culture that

00:06:55,409 --> 00:06:59,879
is kind of working with our culture

00:06:58,139 --> 00:07:03,360
because our culture is a little bit

00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:06,349
special and the basic things that's also

00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:10,830
challenges just balance the capacity the

00:07:06,349 --> 00:07:16,650
capability and the projects so but now

00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:18,569
let's dive into the topic so you know

00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:19,979
self-organization is the topic so we

00:07:18,569 --> 00:07:24,900
should probably talk about what actually

00:07:19,979 --> 00:07:26,789
is self-organization you know this this

00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:29,400
is again as I mentioned before we are

00:07:26,789 --> 00:07:31,289
not an island there's plenty of people

00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:35,460
that are doing research on this there's

00:07:31,289 --> 00:07:38,129
a book by Daniel pink called drive and a

00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:40,259
very nice video that talks about his

00:07:38,129 --> 00:07:40,969
main focus points autonomy mastery and

00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:46,080
purpose

00:07:40,969 --> 00:07:49,110
Spotify they've been very open about how

00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:50,819
they structure their teams and they have

00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:52,830
some really nice videos explaining that

00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:54,300
and then more importantly and this is

00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:55,490
actually where the title comes from

00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:58,650
there's the book reinventing

00:07:55,490 --> 00:08:00,659
organizations from Frederick lalu where

00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:02,909
he really goes in in the research it's

00:08:00,659 --> 00:08:04,860
lots of companies around the world that

00:08:02,909 --> 00:08:06,659
have already attained self-organization

00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:09,659
and tries to pinpoint a little bit what

00:08:06,659 --> 00:08:12,930
makes them tick and work so one of the

00:08:09,659 --> 00:08:15,960
key hypotheses of that book is that you

00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:19,199
know as human humanity evolves and

00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:22,349
reaches new stages of consciousness that

00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:24,960
human humanity has always also found new

00:08:22,349 --> 00:08:29,550
very much more productive organizational

00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:31,889
models and he basically comes up with

00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:32,490
this color mapping of you know several

00:08:31,889 --> 00:08:35,550
stages

00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:37,649
so there's impulsive red which is you

00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:41,640
know he compares to like Street mafia

00:08:37,649 --> 00:08:43,380
gangs or whatever conformist amber which

00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:45,930
is more like the military is organized

00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:47,310
that way achievement orange which is

00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:50,310
more like what the Industrial Age

00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:52,830
brought about pluralistic green we

00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:55,500
is what I think leave definitely covers

00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:57,090
right now which is more modeled around a

00:08:55,500 --> 00:09:00,120
family and then there's this

00:08:57,090 --> 00:09:02,010
evolutionary teal which is you know sort

00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:04,320
of the ultimate goal at this point at

00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:06,300
least so let me briefly talk a little

00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,130
bit more detail about the last three so

00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:09,900
achievement orange this is something

00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:12,270
that you know is still very much modern

00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:14,670
big multinational companies are

00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:16,440
organized like this and one of the the

00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:18,720
key things there is that innovation is

00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:21,150
one of the drivers for these companies

00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:23,580
they have to innovate but innovation is

00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:26,310
done in a pyramid structure so from top

00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:27,930
to bottom and the top you know and

00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:31,350
actually a lot of the innovation comes

00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:33,480
around how the top can better check what

00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:35,610
the what the lower levels are doing so

00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:37,620
they spend and invest a lot of time in

00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:39,480
middle management that just checks

00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:41,490
whatever people are doing below and

00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:44,250
making sure that they do so like people

00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:45,510
are clocking and people you know are

00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:47,660
most efficient and if they're not

00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:50,760
efficient they get their wrist slapped

00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:53,630
so really much also with the achievement

00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:57,000
Orange Age people really started seeing

00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:58,890
sort of companies like machines so

00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,780
they're talked about like we need to

00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:02,400
pull that lever or something like that

00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:04,380
so a lot of the analogies that people

00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:05,880
from the Industrial Age they created

00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:09,450
around companies are really much

00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:11,820
analogies around machines and so people

00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:14,250
in there are also considered machines

00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:17,520
that need to be told exactly what to do

00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:19,470
so the variables need to be removed and

00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:23,100
pluralistic green this is something that

00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:24,660
you know lelou calls postmodern we're

00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:27,210
still very much in a pyramid structure

00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:29,130
but it's more like a family so in the

00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:31,500
sense that you know your boss is now

00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:33,570
kind of like a father or mother figure

00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:36,120
that you know wants you to grow up that

00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:38,370
wants to empower you but the

00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:41,370
relationship never changes you're never

00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:43,830
at the same level so it's always like

00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:45,660
something nice that is given to you

00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:48,900
rather than something that you can just

00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:52,380
take because you know and so the next

00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:55,230
step is evolutionary teal where really

00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:57,480
the goal is to be self-managed so that

00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:59,220
you know nothing in terms of structure

00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:01,050
or hierarchy is stopping you from doing

00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:05,280
the things that you know are the right

00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:07,490
way to go about things so we

00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:10,080
so rather than you know this this

00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:11,400
parent-child relationship is really

00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:13,290
you're all at the same level and you

00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:15,150
might just have different points that

00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:17,370
you focus on and different skills and

00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:22,280
expertise but you really at the same

00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:25,800
height another key idea here is that so

00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:27,600
evolutionary purpose is that you don't

00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:29,520
just talk about what is maybe

00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:32,070
strategically the right thing to do but

00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:34,590
but more what feels right for you as an

00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:36,210
organization that there might be some

00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:38,850
business opportunity that you

00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:40,710
intentionally forego because it's not

00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:42,720
your character you might be taking the

00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:44,940
company in a direction that just will

00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:49,920
not fit with the rest of the people

00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:51,390
there so and maybe and I think that's

00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,250
actually very important to mention is

00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:55,530
that they're actually already plenty of

00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:58,740
organizations that work according to

00:11:55,530 --> 00:12:00,810
this model so you know there's birds

00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:03,240
Arkin and the Netherlands that actually

00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:06,990
revolutionised with the home healthcare

00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:09,089
industry so they went from being nobody

00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:12,089
to having 80 percent of the market

00:12:09,089 --> 00:12:13,770
within a few years there are companies

00:12:12,089 --> 00:12:15,839
like Patagonia that you might know the

00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:18,690
clothing company and so on and so forth

00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:20,160
so again this is not something that that

00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:23,310
doesn't exist out there there are really

00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:27,180
successful companies that are following

00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:29,070
this model so today I would say I

00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:30,960
mentioned this before I would say that

00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:33,270
leap is very much green so it's not just

00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:35,700
our color but I think we also sort of in

00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:37,560
that model from lalu we would definitely

00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:39,780
be green but actually I think we're

00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:43,710
actually very close already to being

00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:45,990
teal and self-organized so maybe some

00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:49,010
you know shallow quick indicators why

00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:51,210
that could be true so we have a lot of

00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:54,780
internally we have a lot of things that

00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:56,310
actually were started by employees that

00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:59,940
just said this makes sense so for

00:12:56,310 --> 00:13:02,640
example our user experience you know

00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:04,290
group of people this was jump-started by

00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:06,300
somebody that wasn't in management and

00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:10,130
they basically went to management said I

00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:12,600
want to make it happen empower me and

00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:14,160
you know things like native mobile

00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,950
development this was again something

00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,020
that

00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:18,430
you know an employee started we're not

00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:20,350
teal in the sense that they still have

00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:23,080
to go to management and say I want to do

00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:25,210
this empower me but at least they

00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:26,680
already feel like they can there's a

00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:31,060
good chance to make it happen when they

00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:33,370
go to management we as Tony mentioned we

00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:35,170
have no middle management in fact we

00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:36,820
don't have a CEO which is sometimes an

00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:38,260
awkward moment when you go to a customer

00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:40,630
and they say like are you serious

00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:43,120
whereas you CEO and we're like yeah we

00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:46,870
don't really have one there's no head of

00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:48,610
X or Y there's no team leads so there's

00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:51,880
no structure within the teams it's all

00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:53,110
sort of organic and I think actually

00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:54,700
maybe one thing that's even more

00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:56,200
important all the partners and

00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:58,390
especially the founders they're willing

00:13:56,200 --> 00:14:01,000
to let go so many of these things have

00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:02,650
weren't in place and day one maybe we

00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,230
thought that we were empowering people

00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:07,720
from day one but we have slowly one by

00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:09,940
one have let go and we found that every

00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:13,660
time we did this it actually made us

00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:16,960
much more agile much more productive so

00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:18,340
you know that really has sort of also so

00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:21,100
the insight already shown us that this

00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:22,840
is the way to go yeah and then just you

00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:25,480
know boring numbers but you know we have

00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:28,840
a salary ratio of one to three so the

00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:30,430
lowest salary that anybody earns that at

00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:34,060
leap compared to somebody that is a

00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:35,860
partner is one to three ratio which I

00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:38,800
don't know it still feels kind of large

00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:42,790
but shockingly this is actually very low

00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:44,350
number yeah and then infective Lee we

00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:47,950
have hundred and thirteen leapers plus

00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:50,200
interns and as we mentioned most of the

00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:51,940
people in management first off they

00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:54,010
don't work full time and number two

00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:56,080
they're also working operational within

00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:57,880
teams so effectively we have the

00:14:56,080 --> 00:15:01,390
full-time equivalent of three people and

00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:04,500
management 413 people without any

00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:04,500
minimum management

00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:14,160
so you now might wonder how does this

00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:16,440
work and that's also the core of our

00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:18,720
presentation to give you a little bit

00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:24,270
insights and our secrets how we make

00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:27,950
this happen we identified I think it's

00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:32,420
four or five core topics around that and

00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:37,080
the first one evolved when we started it

00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:41,130
we kind of learned strategy it's kind of

00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:45,000
not our thing so we have no centralized

00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:47,790
steering we have no such thing like five

00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:50,850
years planning or how do we want to grow

00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:57,150
or to shrink or whatever we have no

00:15:50,850 --> 00:16:00,750
business plans we have annual budgeting

00:15:57,150 --> 00:16:03,180
but if somebody wants do anything is not

00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:07,020
has not a job to create a business plan

00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:09,030
and to prove by numbers that it works we

00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:11,250
kind of learned that because earlier on

00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:13,530
is a good management needs to have kind

00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:15,150
of plan strategy and stuff but we

00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:17,460
learned whenever we did a strategy is

00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:20,610
was very hard to achieve the strategy

00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:23,040
and it was also kind of the things that

00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:25,920
came out without the strategy by side

00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:28,770
were pretty amazing just to give you an

00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:31,860
example we when we were small and like

00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:34,470
the seventeen people there was kind of

00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:37,380
great innovations evolving out of this

00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:40,110
group then we grew and the innovations

00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:42,660
didn't grow the same level so we hired

00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:44,640
an external consultant that okay give us

00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:48,210
an innovation process we need to have

00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:51,030
that and then he made a pretty complex

00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:54,600
but democratic innovation process we

00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:57,240
implemented it but in fact no single

00:16:54,600 --> 00:17:00,240
kind of innovation thing went through

00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:02,880
this process then we reduce that to a

00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:05,100
smaller process that was easier but even

00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:07,380
then there were some innovation

00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:10,320
initiatives mostly some bundles for open

00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:12,540
source frameworks but also that what's

00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:14,220
not what we call innovation so then we

00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:19,689
got rid of it but you see later how it

00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:21,370
came back so and why is this strategy

00:17:19,689 --> 00:17:24,129
working out or just right it feel s

00:17:21,370 --> 00:17:26,529
being working out for us first of all we

00:17:24,129 --> 00:17:29,830
do not have to invest some money into

00:17:26,529 --> 00:17:33,190
some people who define strategies we

00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:35,620
learned that in it empowers people that

00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:38,710
are not meant to do strategy so teams

00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:40,600
every leaper is completely free to say I

00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:43,870
want to go there or I wanted to do this

00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:46,090
and I think this is the right moment so

00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:48,190
we felt a lot of empowerment when we

00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:52,480
publicly said okay let's drop this

00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:55,480
strategy thing we like to be a child and

00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:57,639
having no strategy is kind of super a

00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:59,799
child because you can adapt within hours

00:17:57,639 --> 00:18:01,960
within days to any situation you want

00:17:59,799 --> 00:18:05,789
you don't have to care that this is not

00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:08,470
our strategy and we learned that it

00:18:05,789 --> 00:18:10,690
created the thing that it really uses

00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:13,360
all the skills of us all the motivation

00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:16,870
and all the interests because nobody is

00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:18,490
kind of dedicated to some topic he can

00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:22,210
just live what he wants but he is

00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:24,720
motivated to and obviously you have the

00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:28,480
freedom to test things and adapt things

00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:30,779
we have to admit there are some special

00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:33,159
conditions that makes it even possible

00:18:30,779 --> 00:18:35,139
will you remember when I already

00:18:33,159 --> 00:18:37,690
described our business environment it's

00:18:35,139 --> 00:18:41,080
very fast changing very strong growing

00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:43,000
so our competitors that may do strategic

00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:45,250
planning they don't have a big advantage

00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,409
because you have to adapt to strategy so

00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:52,059
fast to the environment that we without

00:18:47,409 --> 00:18:54,039
strategy can live pretty good and we are

00:18:52,059 --> 00:18:56,200
also in a business where no big

00:18:54,039 --> 00:18:58,480
investments are needed so we don't have

00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:01,090
to invest in a huge machinery producing

00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:04,570
X we just have invest in people in

00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:07,830
locations but these are kind of not

00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:10,509
comparable costs to some big machine and

00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:13,899
what they I also mentioned before we

00:19:10,509 --> 00:19:16,299
practically have no shareholder so there

00:19:13,899 --> 00:19:17,980
is not a big company or a big rich guy

00:19:16,299 --> 00:19:22,929
that says you have to make this 10%

00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:26,799
otherwise I whatever so we really can

00:19:22,929 --> 00:19:29,409
kind of free spend the money as we want

00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:32,230
to and we also have to admit there are

00:19:29,409 --> 00:19:33,510
some guidelines these guidelines are

00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:36,929
pretty obvious

00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:39,269
so whatever a Libra does you should see

00:19:36,929 --> 00:19:42,090
that it maximizes the leaper happiness

00:19:39,269 --> 00:19:44,760
like the happiness of all leapers not

00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:47,399
just his own happiness the happiness of

00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:50,010
our clients and you should care about

00:19:47,399 --> 00:19:52,409
the financial health of his plans and

00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:54,330
there is also a thing like the lead

00:19:52,409 --> 00:19:57,120
manifesto that was written by the

00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:59,880
founders some years ago it describes

00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:03,000
that we were a child that we care for

00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:05,909
the environment and for the people and

00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,409
this hangs in every office but I'm not

00:20:05,909 --> 00:20:14,549
sure that I really will really knows

00:20:07,409 --> 00:20:16,320
what's in there so yeah so I was talking

00:20:14,549 --> 00:20:21,600
about this empowerment and this is

00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:24,480
another core of how we work we learned

00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:26,490
that we have to empower the teams and we

00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:30,330
want to share with you how we did that

00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:33,240
over the past years we have three things

00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:36,360
that our teams achieve today which we

00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:38,760
think is pretty the core of it our teams

00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:42,179
are fixed they are cross-functional and

00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:45,149
they are self organized to give you a

00:20:42,179 --> 00:20:48,779
little bit more meat to that I try to

00:20:45,149 --> 00:20:51,179
create some animation so when we started

00:20:48,779 --> 00:20:54,600
our company at the star you can see as a

00:20:51,179 --> 00:20:57,450
project people were grouped around the

00:20:54,600 --> 00:21:01,230
project even some founder that's the

00:20:57,450 --> 00:21:03,210
black one or some management and you've

00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:04,710
worked on this project but suddenly if

00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:07,529
you have success you get a second

00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:10,230
project so you have more people and you

00:21:07,529 --> 00:21:12,750
try to arrange them around this second

00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:14,130
project and then you grow more than you

00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:16,470
see okay now we need something like

00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:19,529
management like a management team who

00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:25,139
cares for that stuff so we had the

00:21:19,529 --> 00:21:27,539
management team and then it got to a

00:21:25,139 --> 00:21:30,029
point where we had the feeling or it was

00:21:27,539 --> 00:21:32,370
obvious that it's very hard for people

00:21:30,029 --> 00:21:34,019
to keep track what's going to happen

00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:35,340
because you are on this project and

00:21:34,019 --> 00:21:38,669
you're on that and then you're sitting

00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:40,559
on in between having no project you

00:21:38,669 --> 00:21:42,210
learn to collaborate with this guy but

00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:44,580
in the next project we are not with this

00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:46,750
guy together then we tried a pretty

00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:50,470
crazy thing in our industry we made

00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:55,180
fixed teams that's the other management

00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:58,210
guy yeah we made fixed teams so we put

00:21:55,180 --> 00:22:00,370
teams together the teams will ever stay

00:21:58,210 --> 00:22:02,710
or technically or theoretically forever

00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:06,190
stay together and we try to find

00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:08,620
projects that match these teams

00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:11,140
obviously that's a very hard thing to do

00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:13,390
because sometimes you have not the full

00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:16,000
capacity used of the team so you need to

00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:18,940
do some minor project but we kind of

00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,650
managed to work in this model but with

00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:24,520
the further growth we had to introduce

00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:28,330
more special teams like administrational

00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:31,330
team or a business development team or

00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:33,970
operations team and later on what Lucas

00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:37,600
already mentioned creation or user

00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:41,080
experience to you and that worked kind

00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:44,080
of out but you had it kind of influenced

00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:46,120
the culture so development teams told oh

00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:48,760
what the hell did this business guy sell

00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:51,670
and the operations team were complaining

00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:54,430
okay those developers that codebase we

00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:57,190
cannot handle that so we came up with

00:22:54,430 --> 00:23:00,490
the idea of creating cross-functional

00:22:57,190 --> 00:23:03,790
teams so in a cross-functional team a

00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:06,760
team has every skill it needs to acquire

00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:08,560
a project to concept a project to

00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:12,250
develop a project and to maintain a

00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:16,090
project and even partners or managers

00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:21,160
were spread or are spread around these

00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:24,070
teams and to assure that the knowledge

00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:27,100
within one skill is here we introduced

00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:30,070
the gilts there is for example the user

00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:32,680
experience guild that cares about the

00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:34,990
common knowledge around user experience

00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:37,240
or we have the business development

00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:40,510
guild that cares about the income funnel

00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:42,490
in our company and since everyone is in

00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:46,090
a team they know which team could be

00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:49,180
interested in that so with the skills

00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:52,050
and teams we kind of had a pretty good

00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:54,370
organization which made people happy

00:23:52,050 --> 00:23:57,870
there is some exception though that

00:23:54,370 --> 00:23:59,380
administration team still not in the

00:23:57,870 --> 00:24:03,250
operational team

00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:06,370
but we will soon merge this or like and

00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:08,680
we will that mr. rational team had the

00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:10,720
idea let's also go into an operational

00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:12,730
team and if this is going to happen

00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:14,920
basically every leaper is in an

00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:17,020
operational team every liberal feels

00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:20,290
what we do and sees what we do and

00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:23,590
that's a big advantage so having this

00:24:20,290 --> 00:24:27,250
state we set some years like two two and

00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:30,300
a half years ago okay now teams have

00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:34,510
everything they need to do business so

00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:36,400
yeah get self-organized do it so sell

00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:39,730
produce maintain your projects but also

00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:43,990
hire people develop people organize

00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:46,080
people you can do what you want and you

00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:50,110
can take the responsibility for it and

00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:50,830
that was a pretty rough moment I mean

00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:52,930
there were some

00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:55,990
leapers day said yeah we can do

00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:58,000
everything in two months later what are

00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:59,800
we gonna do and there were other people

00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,020
said oh my god no this I can't

00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:05,350
handle it so I just leave so there were

00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:09,670
some guys that left the company but you

00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:12,070
remember the table I showed you we added

00:25:09,670 --> 00:25:14,770
our financial numbers that's the revenue

00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:16,540
i think if some competitors are in here

00:25:14,770 --> 00:25:20,830
they are very happy to see such deep

00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:23,620
details of us so you see two years ago

00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:25,360
our revenue was kind of stagnating a

00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:28,750
little bit we stick to eight millions

00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:33,490
and we introduced the self-organized

00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:36,490
team concept in 2013 the beginning and

00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:38,980
yeah it takes took some time to take off

00:25:36,490 --> 00:25:40,540
it was a shocking moment for us but as

00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:42,880
you seen numbers there might be other

00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:44,920
things that influence that as well but

00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:48,310
as you see numbers it had a huge impact

00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:50,620
for our company having everyone taking

00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:55,000
responsibility for this things he does

00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:59,980
was just great so talking more about

00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:01,960
people yeah so as Tony mentioned

00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:04,510
obviously in this industry we don't need

00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:06,730
to invest in machines but much more

00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:09,070
importantly we're all about people and

00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:12,070
so that that is you know the capital if

00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:13,120
you want to label it that way of any you

00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:16,030
know web company

00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:17,620
for the most part is that you know what

00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:19,210
it comprised of there's all these people

00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:23,380
and what the skills that they have the

00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:25,150
motivations and how they work so briefly

00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:27,160
talking about you know what makes a

00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:30,580
leaper a leaper or how how do you would

00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:32,770
get to become a leaper so one of the key

00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:35,160
things that we look at doing the hiring

00:26:32,770 --> 00:26:39,130
process and so on is the willingness to

00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:41,559
experiment to see things change and

00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:43,990
sometimes I even say that almost like

00:26:41,559 --> 00:26:46,600
staying the same way is for mostly pers

00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:48,610
sort of an uneasy situation they much

00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:50,770
prefer experimenting and seeing

00:26:48,610 --> 00:26:52,179
something else like trying it out and if

00:26:50,770 --> 00:26:54,370
it doesn't work going back but this is

00:26:52,179 --> 00:26:56,740
really some characteristic that we

00:26:54,370 --> 00:26:58,840
really look to it and the second thing

00:26:56,740 --> 00:27:01,140
that we really look to is if they are

00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:04,540
able and interested in trusting people

00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:06,220
so that you know when you know you know

00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:08,350
innovation happens everywhere you know

00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:10,270
you need to be able to trust that other

00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:12,460
people are doing it in the best interest

00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:14,230
of the company and that they're not just

00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:16,120
driving their own egos and this is

00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:18,340
actually sort of a skill to some degree

00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:22,630
you know having the ability to trust

00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:24,490
people we also we you know we of course

00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:25,750
we have you know job offers and you know

00:27:24,490 --> 00:27:27,940
we might say you know we're looking for

00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:31,750
a product owner or we're looking for an

00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:34,360
angularjs developer and but you know in

00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:35,140
fact we're not looking for fixed roles

00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:37,929
like that

00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:40,030
so if a developer notices that there's

00:27:37,929 --> 00:27:41,350
some issues with the user stories that

00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:43,630
are being created by the product owner

00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:45,280
then they should get involved like they

00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:48,160
shouldn't just sit there and wait until

00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:50,200
the product owner gets things right so

00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:52,300
really everybody is absolutely

00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:54,520
encouraged to do whatever it takes as a

00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:56,110
team to get things done and you know and

00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:57,429
it could just be like you know being the

00:27:56,110 --> 00:28:01,000
substitute when somebody goes on

00:27:57,429 --> 00:28:02,980
vacation and things like that and

00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,809
generally and again this is sort of the

00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:06,580
empowerment is sort of the the theme of

00:28:04,809 --> 00:28:08,920
the talk you know we really this is

00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:11,260
really key that's what people get and

00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:14,140
it's amazing what happens when people

00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:17,350
get empowered like they just start being

00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:19,090
so much more productive not necessarily

00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:21,310
because all the ideas that they come up

00:28:19,090 --> 00:28:23,800
with are amazing but just because they

00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:26,260
do everything with much more passion

00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:27,350
right and if you know just starts with

00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:30,140
you know

00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:31,400
not slacking off like you don't you know

00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:34,220
we don't check if people are checking

00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:36,050
the YouTube videos or whatever at work

00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:38,240
because we know they're going to do

00:28:36,050 --> 00:28:39,650
whatever they have to do right so if

00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:42,140
they'll look at YouTube videos during

00:28:39,650 --> 00:28:43,640
the day we don't care because you know

00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:46,720
they might be doing some extra time at

00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:49,430
home and we don't need to double check

00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:51,500
you know their hours that they enter

00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:54,530
because we can have this trust in them

00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:58,360
because we know that they here to do

00:28:54,530 --> 00:29:01,070
things in the best interest of lead and

00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:03,500
another thing that is very important is

00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:05,510
that we also sort of let them partake in

00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:06,620
the success of the company and this is

00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:08,570
something that is actually quite a

00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:10,220
little bit irritating for me so if you

00:29:08,570 --> 00:29:12,470
looked at the reinventing organization

00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:14,210
book and several of the the stories that

00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:16,940
I heard about it many of the

00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:19,400
organizations work based on individual

00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:22,190
bonus systems so you know the more

00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:23,810
efficient you become the more bonus you

00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:26,270
get and this can be sometimes monetary

00:29:23,810 --> 00:29:28,100
it can sometimes be time so there's a I

00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:30,170
think in also in intelligent there's a

00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:32,870
ministry where basically if you get your

00:29:30,170 --> 00:29:34,790
work done you can go on early so this is

00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:36,590
you know nice and so on but I don't know

00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:40,460
to us it didn't feel like the right

00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:42,080
approach so because it basically means

00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:47,600
that you're you're still sort of feeding

00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:49,940
ego and you're still basically enabling

00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:52,160
or you're basically promoting the idea

00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:54,110
of like making yourself look better

00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:57,650
right sorry you like gaming the system

00:29:54,110 --> 00:30:00,200
to some degree so for us what we did we

00:29:57,650 --> 00:30:02,000
basically we pay additional salaries so

00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:04,580
it's custom in Switzerland many cost

00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,650
companies to pay 13 salaries so in

00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:08,480
December you get a 13th salary so we do

00:30:06,650 --> 00:30:10,760
that as well but actually we do our

00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:12,500
yearly you know or ruff annual budgeting

00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:16,520
we do with the goal of paying 14

00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:19,280
salaries and so this is something that

00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:22,940
is really key I think either everybody

00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:24,860
gets the 14th salary or nobody right so

00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:26,720
you know just you know making yourself

00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:28,640
look better doesn't get you another

00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:32,360
salary right it's not your personal

00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:34,330
bonus it is the company bonus so I think

00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:36,830
that's that's a very key philosophy

00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:38,870
philosophy that we have and another

00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:40,580
thing that leapers can count on is that

00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:42,620
we really work hard

00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:46,490
to keep the salaries fair so we have a

00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:48,740
point system that we we use to double

00:30:46,490 --> 00:30:50,990
check if the salaries affair across

00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:53,870
skill set across offices across the

00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:56,180
system ethnicity and diversity and so on

00:30:53,870 --> 00:30:58,820
the forth and we review that honor

00:30:56,180 --> 00:31:00,680
yearly but it's still unfortunately

00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:02,480
something that is done by management so

00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:06,410
this is definitely not teal in that

00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:09,500
sense I mentioned this 14th salary so

00:31:06,410 --> 00:31:13,580
here's another column so in the 8 years

00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:15,410
that we've paid nearly salaries only in

00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:17,750
two years we didn't manage to pay a 14th

00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:20,660
salary they were actually some years

00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:22,190
where he paid a fifteen salary and

00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:25,670
actually I think it's kind of

00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:28,790
interesting like in 2014 we actually

00:31:25,670 --> 00:31:31,250
sort of retro actively paid a salary so

00:31:28,790 --> 00:31:35,390
this star next to the 15th there is that

00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:37,340
we basically paid half of a 14th salary

00:31:35,390 --> 00:31:41,090
to everybody that was already with the

00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:44,120
company in 2012 and to everybody that

00:31:41,090 --> 00:31:46,280
was in the company in 2014 at 13 because

00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:48,920
there were some sort of money that came

00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:51,170
in later than it was originally sort of

00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:54,590
earned so we wanted to correct that a

00:31:51,170 --> 00:31:56,570
little bit and yeah for this year it's

00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:58,010
already very likely that we'll pay 14th

00:31:56,570 --> 00:32:00,620
in fact we've already paid half of the

00:31:58,010 --> 00:32:04,910
14th early because things were going so

00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:07,130
well so one of the the things obviously

00:32:04,910 --> 00:32:10,550
that I mentioned is that you know we

00:32:07,130 --> 00:32:12,080
really pick leapers very much to some of

00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:14,240
the soft skills that they bring into the

00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:17,240
company not so much the technical skills

00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:19,310
only because mostly technical skills are

00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:21,350
much more easily taught especially

00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:24,110
because we have a very good you know you

00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:26,240
know knowledge to exchange culture but

00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:28,610
it's very hard to sort of change people

00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:30,230
sort of in you know their the base

00:32:28,610 --> 00:32:33,650
character or how they approach things

00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:35,960
so this hiring process is very much

00:32:33,650 --> 00:32:37,970
driven by the teams as well as the gills

00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:42,380
to some degree so basically the teams

00:32:37,970 --> 00:32:44,390
decide what profile is missing and they

00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:46,070
they basically go to the administrative

00:32:44,390 --> 00:32:49,370
team and say please publish the job at

00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:51,020
on the website and that process is

00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:52,760
mostly because we decided that we want

00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:53,780
to have some common structure between

00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:55,340
the job

00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:59,590
and that's why it goes to the admins

00:32:55,340 --> 00:33:02,330
team then you know CV start pouring in

00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:06,380
teams and then sometimes also guilds

00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:08,210
check those CDs then you know the gills

00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:10,850
and teams decide who they want to

00:33:08,210 --> 00:33:12,890
interview and they basically get invited

00:33:10,850 --> 00:33:14,720
for a first round in the first round

00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:17,480
it's still somewhat custom that there's

00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:19,340
one person for management and one person

00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:22,670
from a team usually the scrum master and

00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:24,590
the team it's not really hard coded it

00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:26,900
seems like still the team's to some

00:33:24,590 --> 00:33:28,340
degree ask for this and it's sort of

00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:30,050
also a result of the fact that

00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:32,000
management still responsibility

00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:33,380
determines salary so it's very important

00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,420
for somebody for management to actually

00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:39,530
at least having met a person once before

00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:41,720
they get hired at a race so after the

00:33:39,530 --> 00:33:43,370
first round the two people that were in

00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:47,900
the first round they normally talk a lot

00:33:43,370 --> 00:33:50,830
about culture like what how we work and

00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:54,260
then try to figure out if that person

00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:56,840
can relate to how we work we ask a lot

00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:58,910
about how they think that you know their

00:33:56,840 --> 00:34:01,040
past experience apply to how we're doing

00:33:58,910 --> 00:34:04,040
things and how that might have made

00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:06,230
things better or worse and you know we

00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:07,970
you know talk a little bit about you

00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:10,399
know the technology skills but not

00:34:07,970 --> 00:34:12,350
really in depth after that the two

00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:16,610
people discuss maybe go back to the team

00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:19,850
and then a decision is made to to invite

00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:21,649
people to the second round and the

00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:23,990
second round then is basically trying to

00:34:21,649 --> 00:34:25,730
meet as many people as possible from the

00:34:23,990 --> 00:34:28,490
team that will most likely hire that

00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:31,070
person and we basically have two or

00:34:28,490 --> 00:34:32,960
three hours of 20 minutes with Pete one

00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:36,740
or two people going in and talking to

00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:38,480
the candidate and we have mostly no

00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:42,679
processes or how what they're going to

00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:44,600
ask you know so some people might you

00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:47,330
know focus again on cultural aspects

00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:52,040
other people might focus on tech skills

00:34:47,330 --> 00:34:54,050
or any mixture there is one guild that

00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:55,790
decided that they wanted establish sort

00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:58,160
of a test so that's the user experience

00:34:55,790 --> 00:35:00,710
guild so they also make the candidates

00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:02,150
take a test but but other than that we

00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:04,030
don't have any standard testing and it

00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:07,200
basically was an invention by that guild

00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:08,880
sort of as part of their vetting process

00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:11,070
and then after the second round

00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:14,970
everybody gets to give some feedback and

00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:18,000
it's usually is so basically you keep

00:35:14,970 --> 00:35:20,010
some written a feedback you say how you

00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,410
know the tech skills or you know the

00:35:20,010 --> 00:35:24,630
skills that we're looking for if that is

00:35:22,410 --> 00:35:25,950
good match you know we also look at you

00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:27,780
know everybody gets to say if they think

00:35:25,950 --> 00:35:30,800
it's a cultural match and then they

00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:33,750
basically get to say thump up ya higher

00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:36,270
I'll go with the majority or no don't

00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:40,079
hire and basically if a single person

00:35:36,270 --> 00:35:42,089
says don't hire we don't hire sometimes

00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:43,740
then you know we might go back the team

00:35:42,089 --> 00:35:46,380
might discuss it because they might say

00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:48,390
that person voted for don't hire based

00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:50,460
on some wrong assumptions about what the

00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:53,369
person will be doing or some

00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:55,800
misunderstandings but really there's no

00:35:53,369 --> 00:35:57,690
way to overpower and know so basically

00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:59,430
this is this is a discussion that can

00:35:57,690 --> 00:36:02,369
happen in the team it doesn't have to

00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:05,520
happen but we don't overrule it or the

00:36:02,369 --> 00:36:07,380
teams usually don't overrule it so

00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:09,240
basically the teams in the end decide

00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:11,190
who they hire it's not management it's

00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:14,490
not management is not involved in that

00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:16,920
decision where they do get involved

00:36:14,490 --> 00:36:18,839
again is determining a salary and that's

00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:20,520
again one of the reasons why they need

00:36:18,839 --> 00:36:23,640
to meet the candidates to sort of get a

00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:27,089
feel how to you know put people in a

00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:28,680
salary system then admin the

00:36:27,089 --> 00:36:30,390
administrative team creates the contract

00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:32,339
and then you know for another

00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:33,810
administrative tasks for the admin for

00:36:32,339 --> 00:36:36,180
the management team they sign the

00:36:33,810 --> 00:36:38,430
contract but as you can see you really

00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:42,170
like the emphasis is on teams and guild

00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:45,180
in the entire hiring process

00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:47,310
another thing that that is really key is

00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:50,640
exchange and with that we mean really

00:36:47,310 --> 00:36:53,339
exchanging ideas culture and things like

00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:55,380
that so if you look at any company and

00:36:53,339 --> 00:36:57,569
regardless if they're self-organized or

00:36:55,380 --> 00:37:00,569
whatever they are organized company

00:36:57,569 --> 00:37:03,450
culture is very important and but it's

00:37:00,569 --> 00:37:05,400
obviously much easier to at least define

00:37:03,450 --> 00:37:08,310
what company culture is supposed to be

00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:10,020
if you have centralized authority you

00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:11,700
know the reality might be that people

00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:16,079
don't really live it but you can at

00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:17,670
least define it very easily but I don't

00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:19,650
think that many people really flock to

00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:20,890
that idea of having some centralized or

00:37:19,650 --> 00:37:22,780
the authority

00:37:20,890 --> 00:37:25,180
them how they should be spending their

00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:27,750
you know their day what the processes

00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:30,550
should be you know when their daily is

00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:32,230
what their definition of done is what

00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:36,850
industry they should focus on as things

00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:38,530
like that so the company or a cultural

00:37:36,850 --> 00:37:40,570
exchange is very important in this slide

00:37:38,530 --> 00:37:42,880
I'm not sure if everybody can even read

00:37:40,570 --> 00:37:44,590
these lines here but it's not really the

00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:46,990
purpose the purpose of the slide is just

00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:50,170
to all you with all these different

00:37:46,990 --> 00:37:51,490
areas of exchange that we have so for

00:37:50,170 --> 00:37:53,500
example and I think that's actually a

00:37:51,490 --> 00:37:55,750
fun anecdote there's this one week

00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:57,880
newsletter on there so this was an idea

00:37:55,750 --> 00:38:00,070
by scrum master so this was like an

00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:01,540
eternal weekly newsletter they came to

00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:04,480
management like okay we want to get

00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:05,860
budget for this management was like I we

00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:08,650
don't think that just makes sense at all

00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:10,780
they say no we're really really sure it

00:38:08,650 --> 00:38:13,450
makes sense and we're like ok whatever

00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:14,830
so let's we gave him like a budget so

00:38:13,450 --> 00:38:16,750
they can do it for three months and then

00:38:14,830 --> 00:38:18,760
we said okay we assume they're going to

00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:20,320
realize it was a waste of time and then

00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:22,780
you know we can get over it rather than

00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:25,000
arguing about it forever turns out there

00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:26,530
was a huge success like people really

00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:29,620
loved it and that's it's actually kind

00:38:26,530 --> 00:38:32,620
of I've so notice this often times that

00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:34,750
candidates mentioned like when they when

00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:36,190
they joined leap that's this is one of

00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:39,220
the greatest ways for them to get into

00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:42,550
the company another thing that we do is

00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:44,800
team road road shows so we have once a

00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:47,050
month one of the teams goes to all the

00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:48,910
different offices and presents what

00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:50,560
they're currently working on some of the

00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:52,960
challenges they're dealing with and how

00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:55,090
are they dealing with them we are also

00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:59,470
using slack which is a sort of a chat

00:38:55,090 --> 00:39:02,800
system extensively if we started I think

00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:04,990
in 2014 early 2014 with it we now have

00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:07,840
about three times as many channels as

00:39:04,990 --> 00:39:09,850
employees and it's working really great

00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:11,770
it's really fostering the exchange much

00:39:09,850 --> 00:39:14,050
better than Skype that we were using

00:39:11,770 --> 00:39:16,450
previously which was really hard because

00:39:14,050 --> 00:39:18,070
it was creating these discussion silos

00:39:16,450 --> 00:39:19,960
because you need to invite people in to

00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:21,430
channels and select they can just jump

00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:23,920
into whatever channel they want to talk

00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:25,870
in another thing that is actually still

00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:28,000
very much part of our culture is that we

00:39:25,870 --> 00:39:29,770
have you know nowadays we have quite a

00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:32,110
few alumni's that have you know left

00:39:29,770 --> 00:39:34,180
leave for various reasons and we still

00:39:32,110 --> 00:39:34,420
very much invite them to you know come

00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:37,210
to

00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:40,930
barbecues come to our parties give leap

00:39:37,210 --> 00:39:42,640
talks that we do once a week and I think

00:39:40,930 --> 00:39:44,859
to a largely that that maybe might also

00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:47,980
be an indicator to showing that people

00:39:44,859 --> 00:39:49,990
actually really like leap and working

00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:51,430
with leap and being part of leap you

00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:53,920
know that they keep coming back even

00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:57,880
after they've left the company for you

00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:59,680
know whatever reasons another thing that

00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:02,650
is very important to us is transparency

00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:05,859
and I want to show this a little bit so

00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:08,470
this is so every team has a financial

00:40:05,859 --> 00:40:12,040
dashboard which shows them on a weekly

00:40:08,470 --> 00:40:15,069
monthly quarterly and yearly basis

00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:16,780
aggregate values of how they're

00:40:15,069 --> 00:40:20,440
contributing to the financial health of

00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:23,950
the company and we introduced this I

00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:26,829
think in 2013 the first version and then

00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:28,750
last year the second version of that and

00:40:26,829 --> 00:40:31,359
the idea really is that you see this

00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:34,450
lower number of the 156 this bar there

00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:35,799
this is sort of the key bar if that is

00:40:34,450 --> 00:40:38,829
green it means that they're contributing

00:40:35,799 --> 00:40:40,960
to paying the 14th salary if it's orange

00:40:38,829 --> 00:40:43,480
they're just barely they're still

00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:46,059
contributing to a 14th jelly if it's red

00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:48,190
it basically means that they're not

00:40:46,059 --> 00:40:49,540
helping to get it to a 14th salary that

00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:49,839
they need the other teams to help them

00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:53,140
out

00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:56,230
essentially this numbers basically it's

00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:57,670
based on sort of experience we've kind

00:40:56,230 --> 00:41:00,640
of figured out that we have like some

00:40:57,670 --> 00:41:04,660
number that we need to earn per hour in

00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:07,809
order to be profitable so it's you know

00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:11,170
very much not some theory but just you

00:41:07,809 --> 00:41:12,640
know looking at empirics we've whited it

00:41:11,170 --> 00:41:15,180
out you know because I don't know we

00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:18,180
felt that it was a little bit maybe

00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:20,530
confusing to have that number there

00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:22,420
because you know it's really specific to

00:41:20,530 --> 00:41:24,520
us and we're not saying that this is the

00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:27,339
number that Chico should go for the bar

00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:28,990
above this is sort of an indicator if

00:41:27,339 --> 00:41:31,450
you're red for example this could help

00:41:28,990 --> 00:41:33,250
you find out why you are red so there's

00:41:31,450 --> 00:41:34,960
you know different numbers there if you

00:41:33,250 --> 00:41:36,790
mouse over them in the tool you see what

00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:41,619
they're about so they're basically like

00:41:36,790 --> 00:41:44,559
the the chargeable hours is 70% here 20%

00:41:41,619 --> 00:41:46,360
I think here I don't remember

00:41:44,559 --> 00:41:48,340
there's one for four

00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:50,320
development efforts and the thing that

00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:52,240
is going to be read here is 8% this is

00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:53,650
internal stuff so this is stuff that was

00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:56,920
not possible to be written down on the

00:41:53,650 --> 00:41:58,630
project so if this team would be read

00:41:56,920 --> 00:42:00,460
you know they might look at this above

00:41:58,630 --> 00:42:02,560
chart and see ah so we're doing a little

00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:04,690
bit more than what most teams do with

00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:06,040
internal stuff so let's look at what we

00:42:04,690 --> 00:42:08,410
were right time we're writing down could

00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:11,140
be more efficient are we writing down

00:42:08,410 --> 00:42:12,850
like the time for our dailies on

00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:15,700
internal stuff rather than the client

00:42:12,850 --> 00:42:17,740
and things like that so really this is

00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:21,490
above the bar is more of like a helper

00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:24,490
to figure out where you're at and or why

00:42:21,490 --> 00:42:26,470
you're where you're at one thing I

00:42:24,490 --> 00:42:28,110
should also note is that if a team is

00:42:26,470 --> 00:42:30,400
red it doesn't mean that they're fired

00:42:28,110 --> 00:42:31,780
it basically means that you know they

00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:34,030
need to maybe think about if their

00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:38,740
current approach to doing things is

00:42:34,030 --> 00:42:40,780
working out yeah so basically you know

00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:42,550
it's just something that that should it

00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:43,960
should alert them that maybe they need

00:42:42,550 --> 00:42:45,010
to rethink some of the things rather

00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:46,600
than just keep going

00:42:45,010 --> 00:42:49,090
what they're doing but if they have a

00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:50,830
good reason so for example my team we

00:42:49,090 --> 00:42:54,070
were investing into a new partnership

00:42:50,830 --> 00:42:56,140
earlier this year with the Swiss post

00:42:54,070 --> 00:42:58,120
and it basically meant that we were you

00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:59,620
know doing lots of non-chargeable hours

00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:03,370
and you know we had a good reason why we

00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:05,380
were temporarily in red the other thing

00:43:03,370 --> 00:43:07,240
that I want to mention here with

00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:09,670
transparency is that you have to spend a

00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:12,340
lot of time and we do this explaining

00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:14,200
why things are the way they are so I

00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:16,300
just want to briefly start the

00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:18,070
presentation of how we introduce the

00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:19,780
updated version of the dashboards and

00:43:18,070 --> 00:43:22,900
this is going to run through here in the

00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:25,270
background it's you know it would take

00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:27,160
the entire hour here to explain all of

00:43:25,270 --> 00:43:28,960
what's going on there but you know we

00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:30,850
really take a lot of time explaining why

00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:32,860
the things are the way they are and

00:43:30,850 --> 00:43:35,770
really convince people why it makes

00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:38,260
sense to do it this way rather than you

00:43:35,770 --> 00:43:44,080
know just telling them by authority this

00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:46,090
is how things should be done right so I

00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:51,850
think that's this you know to me wraps

00:43:46,090 --> 00:43:54,730
up transparency now the big question

00:43:51,850 --> 00:43:58,360
what is actually missing to reach teal

00:43:54,730 --> 00:44:02,770
for us let's just summarize

00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:04,660
firstly what we achieved so as you

00:44:02,770 --> 00:44:07,690
learned we have very little classical

00:44:04,660 --> 00:44:09,850
manage capacity strategies are driven by

00:44:07,690 --> 00:44:13,120
the team yes some still ask management

00:44:09,850 --> 00:44:16,600
for allowing things but some also just

00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:19,570
do things and the hiring is also within

00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:22,270
the teams so what's left over it's

00:44:19,570 --> 00:44:25,420
actually the nasty stuff so the whole

00:44:22,270 --> 00:44:27,370
salary topic a huge headache then

00:44:25,420 --> 00:44:29,770
conflict management not just between

00:44:27,370 --> 00:44:31,840
deepers there are happily not too many

00:44:29,770 --> 00:44:33,790
conflicts but also clients there are

00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:35,530
some clients I want to see the boss so

00:44:33,790 --> 00:44:38,410
that's going to be difficult without

00:44:35,530 --> 00:44:39,910
bosses then for the bigger budget

00:44:38,410 --> 00:44:41,800
decisions we would like to have a

00:44:39,910 --> 00:44:43,720
process where Libra can decide by

00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:47,620
themselves if they want to change the

00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:49,630
education budget per head or not we have

00:44:47,620 --> 00:44:52,000
some legal limitations that we have to

00:44:49,630 --> 00:44:53,710
deal with with in Switzerland so every

00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:56,560
company needs to have a management for

00:44:53,710 --> 00:44:59,680
example nobody knows how it's going to

00:44:56,560 --> 00:45:03,460
react during crisis now the interesting

00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:06,250
stuff how are we planning to get to so

00:45:03,460 --> 00:45:08,920
to master that basically there are two

00:45:06,250 --> 00:45:10,780
different ways to approach that we could

00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:14,640
do it by ourself or we could take

00:45:10,780 --> 00:45:17,170
something from the shelf the self means

00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:22,210
to give you an example we just proceed

00:45:17,170 --> 00:45:24,520
like we did the past years so somebody

00:45:22,210 --> 00:45:27,340
has an idea somebody makes it better

00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:29,650
an example is the salary workgroup I

00:45:27,340 --> 00:45:32,590
said that's one of the nasty things so

00:45:29,650 --> 00:45:36,370
people that was recently like two weeks

00:45:32,590 --> 00:45:38,560
ago gathered themselves and said okay we

00:45:36,370 --> 00:45:40,420
want to have a solution for the salary

00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:42,760
topic so not management needs to define

00:45:40,420 --> 00:45:44,890
the salary for everyone so people from

00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:47,860
guilds teams and different location

00:45:44,890 --> 00:45:51,610
built a workgroup and discuss about that

00:45:47,860 --> 00:45:53,770
and the goal is to make a proposal and

00:45:51,610 --> 00:45:55,660
then some undefined process might let it

00:45:53,770 --> 00:46:00,390
happen or not that's how it usually

00:45:55,660 --> 00:46:03,910
works at leap the example for shelf is

00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:05,230
on accuracy that's a framework that you

00:46:03,910 --> 00:46:07,560
can implement in your company

00:46:05,230 --> 00:46:11,150
organization to have a teal status

00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:13,670
sounds amazing but to see

00:46:11,150 --> 00:46:16,370
if this is really the thing it says and

00:46:13,670 --> 00:46:18,950
I just some sharepoint thingy leapers

00:46:16,370 --> 00:46:21,560
from different teams guild guilds and

00:46:18,950 --> 00:46:25,520
locations they go to trainings and to

00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:27,290
make a plan to make proposals things

00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:29,440
like hola Chrissy would definitely give

00:46:27,290 --> 00:46:32,030
us some benefit so we could have

00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:35,030
documentation its tested there are other

00:46:32,030 --> 00:46:37,460
companies doing it there are the

00:46:35,030 --> 00:46:40,880
availability of trainings and it got

00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:43,160
open source recently so we can also just

00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:45,740
take it and fork it but there are also

00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:49,010
concerns too such an approach example

00:46:45,740 --> 00:46:52,130
holacracy that thing is pretty role

00:46:49,010 --> 00:46:54,590
based so you basically the Organization

00:46:52,130 --> 00:46:58,760
defines exact roles which roles has

00:46:54,590 --> 00:47:00,500
which responsibilities and that just

00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:02,420
that fact will be difficult for us

00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:07,330
because we don't like roles we like

00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:09,920
skills there's also the risk that we

00:47:07,330 --> 00:47:11,350
could honor the Tala cracy could undo

00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:13,910
some things we achieved

00:47:11,350 --> 00:47:15,560
unlike scrum where we integrate this

00:47:13,910 --> 00:47:17,930
ground which is also something from the

00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:20,060
shelf we basically had no project

00:47:17,930 --> 00:47:22,220
management so it was great to have

00:47:20,060 --> 00:47:24,610
something but here we are in a different

00:47:22,220 --> 00:47:27,230
state we reached some point and

00:47:24,610 --> 00:47:29,150
implementing that it's going to be

00:47:27,230 --> 00:47:31,640
difficult so the questions sell for

00:47:29,150 --> 00:47:33,290
shelf we'll see we don't know yet but it

00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:39,260
will definitely happen within the next

00:47:33,290 --> 00:47:42,610
month yes let's talk a little bit about

00:47:39,260 --> 00:47:45,080
opportunities and and this is more again

00:47:42,610 --> 00:47:47,180
you know also maybe what your

00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:50,750
opportunities could be if you're

00:47:47,180 --> 00:47:53,090
applying this so fast adapting I think

00:47:50,750 --> 00:47:54,950
this is a huge opportunity that to some

00:47:53,090 --> 00:47:56,540
degree before you realised with what

00:47:54,950 --> 00:47:59,000
we've done but we're still not there yet

00:47:56,540 --> 00:48:00,980
as I mentioned right now if the employee

00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:02,720
or leaper has a great idea they still

00:48:00,980 --> 00:48:05,030
need to go to management to get a bigger

00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:07,940
budget right so we're we're still a

00:48:05,030 --> 00:48:10,310
bottleneck and so removing that

00:48:07,940 --> 00:48:12,140
bottleneck would make us even faster and

00:48:10,310 --> 00:48:14,150
adapting and I think there's a there's a

00:48:12,140 --> 00:48:15,710
pretty cool example and again this this

00:48:14,150 --> 00:48:19,010
this came through management but it was

00:48:15,710 --> 00:48:22,100
essentially driven by by a team so last

00:48:19,010 --> 00:48:24,230
year we we were working with a customer

00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:24,920
we were body leasing to them we didn't

00:48:24,230 --> 00:48:27,560
like working

00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:29,800
their office so we asked him couldn't we

00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:34,370
just have our own office next to yours

00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:36,230
in a different city and from the idea to

00:48:34,370 --> 00:48:38,540
actually doing it in less than 30 days

00:48:36,230 --> 00:48:41,090
we had a new office and it was basically

00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:42,530
people within the old office that said

00:48:41,090 --> 00:48:44,510
actually I live pretty close to that

00:48:42,530 --> 00:48:46,340
city so it doesn't matter for me which

00:48:44,510 --> 00:48:49,130
city I work with and actually I think it

00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:50,780
was kind of awesome to work there so

00:48:49,130 --> 00:48:52,730
basically they decided yeah I want to

00:48:50,780 --> 00:48:55,130
make it happen and and they were really

00:48:52,730 --> 00:48:57,710
a key driver in making this possible so

00:48:55,130 --> 00:48:59,960
we are already able to do really fat

00:48:57,710 --> 00:49:03,980
quickly adapt but I think we could be

00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:05,390
even faster self-responsibility again

00:49:03,980 --> 00:49:09,080
this is something that too many degree

00:49:05,390 --> 00:49:11,510
we already attained but I think for

00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:13,670
example right now still you know with

00:49:11,510 --> 00:49:16,160
conflict management it's still really

00:49:13,670 --> 00:49:18,350
that you know the management then goes

00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:21,080
in and in sort of saves the day or not

00:49:18,350 --> 00:49:23,210
and so I think this is something that

00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:25,640
you know we will have to invest also in

00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:27,500
training and just making people willing

00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:30,110
and capable of dealing with conflicts

00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:32,060
and at that point I think we will remove

00:49:30,110 --> 00:49:34,790
one of the big stumbling blocks I have

00:49:32,060 --> 00:49:36,530
to admit right now I am in a face and

00:49:34,790 --> 00:49:38,270
Antonio as well we both are actually

00:49:36,530 --> 00:49:40,070
kind of stuck in a phase where we're

00:49:38,270 --> 00:49:43,010
very much overworked this just happened

00:49:40,070 --> 00:49:45,260
I think it will you know get back to a

00:49:43,010 --> 00:49:46,820
normal level but right now we feel like

00:49:45,260 --> 00:49:48,590
sometimes when there are conflicts

00:49:46,820 --> 00:49:51,130
people are turning to us and we're not

00:49:48,590 --> 00:49:54,110
as efficient as they are used to right

00:49:51,130 --> 00:49:55,760
and you know again we're a bottleneck to

00:49:54,110 --> 00:49:59,420
solving problems and that shouldn't be

00:49:55,760 --> 00:50:02,720
the case and then happy people this is

00:49:59,420 --> 00:50:05,690
this is a huge opportunity we like I

00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:07,430
mentioned every time that the management

00:50:05,690 --> 00:50:10,100
has given up things and handing it to

00:50:07,430 --> 00:50:11,480
people you know there were some people

00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:13,430
that didn't like it and they left but

00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:15,800
the majority of people really enjoyed it

00:50:13,430 --> 00:50:19,010
and it really drives them and it just

00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:20,620
makes it more happy and you know that in

00:50:19,010 --> 00:50:22,880
of itself I think is an opportunity

00:50:20,620 --> 00:50:25,640
again because we don't have to make some

00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:27,320
shareholder happy right if we can make

00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:30,100
ourselves happy then you know we've

00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:30,100
already succeeded

00:50:32,190 --> 00:50:38,310
but there are also challenges to this

00:50:34,819 --> 00:50:40,079
self-realization approach the thing is

00:50:38,310 --> 00:50:43,530
you cannot come back command-and-control

00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:45,569
anymore in fact even today we do not do

00:50:43,530 --> 00:50:47,819
that even if we could you have to

00:50:45,569 --> 00:50:49,230
convince and to convince you have to

00:50:47,819 --> 00:50:52,020
really know what you're talking about

00:50:49,230 --> 00:50:54,329
you have to find the right reasons to

00:50:52,020 --> 00:50:56,520
tell your story and the other we have to

00:50:54,329 --> 00:50:59,550
be a good communicator and not not

00:50:56,520 --> 00:51:03,030
everybody is a good communicator so in a

00:50:59,550 --> 00:51:07,710
self organization it's not too easy for

00:51:03,030 --> 00:51:10,290
them other different our difficult topic

00:51:07,710 --> 00:51:13,619
is career so we have no titles or

00:51:10,290 --> 00:51:16,140
hierarchies or models it takes a little

00:51:13,619 --> 00:51:17,940
while until people see okay I mean it's

00:51:16,140 --> 00:51:19,349
awesome I can do what I want I can you

00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:22,470
reach what I want I can create new

00:51:19,349 --> 00:51:25,200
offices I can go abroad I can introduce

00:51:22,470 --> 00:51:29,280
new technologies but because there is no

00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:32,400
titles it's very hard what did I make a

00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:35,460
career yes or no we are open to write

00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:38,670
any title they want in recommendation

00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:41,400
letters but still you have to get it to

00:51:38,670 --> 00:51:43,829
realize what is my career

00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:46,650
and the same as being countering - it's

00:51:43,829 --> 00:51:49,079
from lots of years ago it will also be

00:51:46,650 --> 00:51:51,900
your a problem so clients are used to

00:51:49,079 --> 00:51:54,030
have some responsible person and if we

00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:55,200
say you can talk to anyone in this

00:51:54,030 --> 00:51:57,680
company everybody has same

00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:59,910
responsibility that's gonna be hard and

00:51:57,680 --> 00:52:02,040
obviously nobody knows what's going to

00:51:59,910 --> 00:52:08,550
happen if bad times come so that's also

00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:11,700
a threat that's fear but finally we try

00:52:08,550 --> 00:52:14,369
to summarize now our key elements out of

00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:17,250
this presentation whether you should

00:52:14,369 --> 00:52:20,880
think of or think not going to the same

00:52:17,250 --> 00:52:23,220
adventure as we do so what seems

00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:25,470
important to us is that you have a

00:52:23,220 --> 00:52:29,010
business that can also work without main

00:52:25,470 --> 00:52:31,050
long term strategy that you working on

00:52:29,010 --> 00:52:35,160
our organizational structure where

00:52:31,050 --> 00:52:37,380
people can be empowered our management

00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:39,990
tasks are actually drastically reduced

00:52:37,380 --> 00:52:42,720
that's a good start to get into this

00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:45,360
topic you will need full transparency

00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:47,580
above everything so people

00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:50,340
every single person knows what is the

00:52:47,580 --> 00:52:54,330
impact of my work or of this for the

00:52:50,340 --> 00:52:56,640
whole company and what is always

00:52:54,330 --> 00:52:58,920
valuable is a strong culture of exchange

00:52:56,640 --> 00:53:01,740
because people have to talk together and

00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:04,380
to organize themselves so if you find

00:53:01,740 --> 00:53:08,610
yourself here we just can recommend give

00:53:04,380 --> 00:53:10,290
it a try and welcome to the community so

00:53:08,610 --> 00:53:11,880
thank you very much for listening and

00:53:10,290 --> 00:53:15,420
thank you Drupal con are having this

00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:17,250
opportunity there we were asked to make

00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:21,270
some advertisement for the Sprint on

00:53:17,250 --> 00:53:30,660
Friday and to evaluate our talk I know

00:53:21,270 --> 00:53:32,100
we are very open for questions yes I

00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:34,770
guess there's a microphone over there

00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:36,270
I'm not sure if it's working but I just

00:53:34,770 --> 00:53:39,740
sit down and we repeat the question

00:53:36,270 --> 00:53:39,740
that's fine sorry sorry for me

00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:54,760
okay so the question was about the

00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:56,170
salary system how transparent it is so

00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:58,990
there's one thing that has always been

00:53:56,170 --> 00:54:01,510
the case we have defined salary levels

00:53:58,990 --> 00:54:03,609
and there in the wiki so everybody can

00:54:01,510 --> 00:54:06,250
see the salary level so everybody can

00:54:03,609 --> 00:54:07,570
see my salary at least and they can see

00:54:06,250 --> 00:54:10,150
wherever there are on the scale

00:54:07,570 --> 00:54:11,410
themselves but they don't know the

00:54:10,150 --> 00:54:14,349
salary of the person that they're

00:54:11,410 --> 00:54:17,740
working with the other thing I mentioned

00:54:14,349 --> 00:54:20,230
there's there's a point system so it's

00:54:17,740 --> 00:54:23,820
public knowledge what carry like

00:54:20,230 --> 00:54:26,349
criterias we have so it's basically

00:54:23,820 --> 00:54:27,849
education work experience are sort of

00:54:26,349 --> 00:54:29,980
hard facts and then there's some soft

00:54:27,849 --> 00:54:33,030
text like how much of a team motivator

00:54:29,980 --> 00:54:35,349
that person is how self-driven they are

00:54:33,030 --> 00:54:37,090
how good of the communicator they are

00:54:35,349 --> 00:54:38,920
and then we have sort of like the Joker

00:54:37,090 --> 00:54:40,420
topic which is basically everything that

00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:43,000
doesn't fit in that system we can still

00:54:40,420 --> 00:54:45,760
give some points and then we compute a

00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:48,490
total point value but the total point

00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:50,200
value is also not public knowledge so

00:54:48,490 --> 00:54:52,540
they don't really know where we put them

00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:56,230
but sometimes you know when I'm talking

00:54:52,540 --> 00:54:58,330
to an employee doing the individual

00:54:56,230 --> 00:55:00,520
employee meetings they might ask me okay

00:54:58,330 --> 00:55:02,140
so where am i low in the points right

00:55:00,520 --> 00:55:04,270
and then I would say it works for

00:55:02,140 --> 00:55:06,339
example we feel that there's potential

00:55:04,270 --> 00:55:08,170
in communication right there you know

00:55:06,339 --> 00:55:10,270
that's the area will feel you're lacking

00:55:08,170 --> 00:55:12,550
most something like that so we're not

00:55:10,270 --> 00:55:16,230
entirely transparent about it and this

00:55:12,550 --> 00:55:16,230
is the big question how to get there

00:55:22,190 --> 00:55:27,599
yes that's totally transparent and it

00:55:25,799 --> 00:55:29,789
also leads to the fact that when a team

00:55:27,599 --> 00:55:32,460
is very green so they could spend their

00:55:29,789 --> 00:55:34,740
money to do some innovation and they see

00:55:32,460 --> 00:55:36,510
okay there are the teams in red they

00:55:34,740 --> 00:55:39,000
usually don't spend their money because

00:55:36,510 --> 00:55:43,760
they know the community bones will just

00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:43,760
be paid if the average then is green

00:55:46,369 --> 00:55:55,049
not until now but I definitely can see

00:55:50,089 --> 00:55:57,690
potentially there was one case so we had

00:55:55,049 --> 00:55:59,130
one team and there were just you know it

00:55:57,690 --> 00:56:00,660
was actually new office Lausanne they

00:55:59,130 --> 00:56:02,640
were doing like Boston they had a client

00:56:00,660 --> 00:56:05,000
that was just basically throwing work at

00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:07,559
them and and this was actually in this

00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:09,960
2012-2013 phase and we had two big

00:56:07,559 --> 00:56:12,299
projects in Ybor and and Zurich that

00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:14,099
weren't going well and at the end of

00:56:12,299 --> 00:56:15,839
their they were like why are we getting

00:56:14,099 --> 00:56:17,700
a fourteenth like we feel like we're

00:56:15,839 --> 00:56:18,900
doing a lot and then something

00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:21,030
interesting happened the next year is

00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:24,329
that this big sign stopped giving them

00:56:21,030 --> 00:56:25,859
work so suddenly for three months they

00:56:24,329 --> 00:56:27,809
were basically more or less out of work

00:56:25,859 --> 00:56:28,890
so they you know they did some

00:56:27,809 --> 00:56:30,329
innovation things so they kept

00:56:28,890 --> 00:56:31,799
themselves busy in a sensible way and

00:56:30,329 --> 00:56:34,380
they actually got on the Django

00:56:31,799 --> 00:56:35,849
bandwagon but I think now you know we

00:56:34,380 --> 00:56:38,339
have a good example of you know why it

00:56:35,849 --> 00:56:40,799
makes sense to be you know to share

00:56:38,339 --> 00:56:50,490
share the success rather than just you

00:56:40,799 --> 00:56:55,140
know getting upset yes yes that's my

00:56:50,490 --> 00:56:57,150
topic it works pretty much like we tell

00:56:55,140 --> 00:57:00,119
the market what we do and the market

00:56:57,150 --> 00:57:02,069
requests services from us it's kind of

00:57:00,119 --> 00:57:04,440
one of the big factors how we grow or

00:57:02,069 --> 00:57:07,200
not grow so we do not do actively sales

00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:09,480
we wait on requests and then we

00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:14,660
sometimes pitch something times don't

00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:14,660
have to yes

00:57:43,369 --> 00:57:48,619
the question was if it's challenging if

00:57:46,589 --> 00:57:54,390
people don't work full-time in this

00:57:48,619 --> 00:57:56,849
organization yes it is but we do just

00:57:54,390 --> 00:58:00,690
basic recommendations so we recommend

00:57:56,849 --> 00:58:02,569
that people do not work less than 60% if

00:58:00,690 --> 00:58:05,930
they're in your operational role like

00:58:02,569 --> 00:58:08,160
developers the most difficult is is for

00:58:05,930 --> 00:58:10,319
product owners which are not on the

00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:12,960
client if they just work 40% it's hard

00:58:10,319 --> 00:58:15,359
but basically we let the team deal with

00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:18,480
it we can feel sometimes some team

00:58:15,359 --> 00:58:22,950
pressure to this person not to reduce to

00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:25,170
50% but we learned as long as that is

00:58:22,950 --> 00:58:27,029
not a critical mass like lots of people

00:58:25,170 --> 00:58:30,779
in the team that work 50% it works

00:58:27,029 --> 00:58:32,720
actually maybe to add some tea to that I

00:58:30,779 --> 00:58:36,569
think actually it makes us stronger

00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:37,740
because most you know not everybody is

00:58:36,569 --> 00:58:40,589
there all the time people go on vacation

00:58:37,740 --> 00:58:42,930
they get sick sometimes there's an old

00:58:40,589 --> 00:58:45,539
project haunting them so they have to go

00:58:42,930 --> 00:58:47,789
support do support so basically for us

00:58:45,539 --> 00:58:49,319
this is a normal state you can't expect

00:58:47,789 --> 00:58:51,359
everybody to be there all the time

00:58:49,319 --> 00:58:52,710
so we learn how to deal with it it's

00:58:51,359 --> 00:58:55,079
kind of like what people say a

00:58:52,710 --> 00:58:56,309
deployment deployment is hard do it more

00:58:55,079 --> 00:58:59,670
often because then you get through

00:58:56,309 --> 00:59:01,109
routine so for us we just made we dealt

00:58:59,670 --> 00:59:03,809
with it you know there's wiki there's

00:59:01,109 --> 00:59:05,519
slack so you know people are you know

00:59:03,809 --> 00:59:09,690
preparing themselves handing over

00:59:05,519 --> 00:59:11,700
properly yeah anyway we'd love to answer

00:59:09,690 --> 00:59:15,509
more questions unfortunately I have to

00:59:11,700 --> 00:59:17,700
go we'll be around at least until

00:59:15,509 --> 00:59:19,380
Thursday we'd love to talk to more

00:59:17,700 --> 00:59:21,210
people especially some people that have

00:59:19,380 --> 00:59:23,849
maybe experiences of their own trying

00:59:21,210 --> 00:59:27,710
this out so thank you very much for

00:59:23,849 --> 00:59:27,710
