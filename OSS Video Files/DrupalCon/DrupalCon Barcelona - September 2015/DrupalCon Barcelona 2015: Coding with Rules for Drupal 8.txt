Title: DrupalCon Barcelona 2015: Coding with Rules for Drupal 8
Publication date: 2015-09-22
Playlist: DrupalCon Barcelona - September 2015
Description: 
	The #d8rules initiative is working on porting the Rules module to Drupal 8. In this session fago, klausi & dasjo will work with you to get started with writing events, conditions and actions for Rules in Drupal 8.

The session will be a great case study for people familiar with basic Drupal development concepts eager to jump into developing for Drupal 8. As Rules tries to leverage best-practices as much as possible, it is a great starting point to learn all the new things.

Beside an update on the latest development status, weâ€™ll introduce you to the following topics:

Applying new architectural patterns in Drupal 8
Understanding the Core Plug-in & Context systems
Typed Data API basics
Writing Rules action & conditions plugins
Related configuration entities and YAML files
Embedding reusable components in your modules!

Disclaimer: Rules 8.x is still in its early phase and does not have a stable release yet.
