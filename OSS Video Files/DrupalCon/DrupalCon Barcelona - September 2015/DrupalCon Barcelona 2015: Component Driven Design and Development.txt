Title: DrupalCon Barcelona 2015: Component Driven Design and Development
Publication date: 2015-09-22
Playlist: DrupalCon Barcelona - September 2015
Description: 
	The Web is in permanent evolution, specially the Front end world. Solutions like Responsive Web Design have transformed our day-to-day and forced us to rethink our workflow constantly.

Working with components means to take a step back to integrate and improve this workflow. New tools and methodologies that can help us are appearing every day and it only takes small mindset shifts to take full advantage of them.

Atomic design is an amazing example of these methodologies that are able to assist us with this change. It relies on interlocking components, from small bits like labels (atoms) to large systems like full page templates.
This applies to all the pieces involved in the Front end layer: from the design to the prototype creation or the final code, or also live Styleguides like KSS or CSS methodologies like BEM or SMACSS.
On top of all the above, it will allow us to test our Front end layer, avoiding regressions and preparing it for large-scale projects.

In this session, we will cover:

What is a component
How CSS methodologies like BEM or SMACSS can help to create or use components
Why Design Systems are necessary
When can we introduce this changes in our process
Why Stylesguides can make the difference
What can we do to have a more component-based Drupal project

well hello everybody today i am going to

00:00:06,029 --> 00:00:12,480
talk about component driven design and

00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:14,790
development i am Christina to Amelia you

00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,940
can find me on Twitter are as two

00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:22,020
million source achren on drupal.org on

00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:25,019
ion or on ivory see I'm designer and

00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:28,949
front-end developer at timbra a Drupal

00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:31,820
show based in Barcelona I come from the

00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:35,940
graphic design goal I'm not the

00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:39,390
developer I wasn't developer but I met

00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:41,940
RuPaul about five years ago when i

00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:45,870
became freelance and I've been doing

00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:49,050
rupal same same well what are we going

00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:51,480
to talk about on this session I'm going

00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:56,129
to talk about components what they are

00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:59,910
and why can they be useful about design

00:00:56,129 --> 00:01:03,000
systems about CSS methodologies and what

00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:05,970
they are about the style guides and how

00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:10,110
can they help and of course how can we

00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:13,350
implement everything on Drupal but first

00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:18,890
let me say a couple of things about web

00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:23,070
projects I'm pretty sure all of you are

00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:27,869
know the typical waterfall project that

00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:30,450
is that everything is done everything

00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:33,299
starts when the previous passe is

00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:35,790
finished for example you don't start the

00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:38,579
design until the planning is already

00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:40,640
done you don't start the development

00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:43,200
until the design is completely finished

00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:45,869
you don't start the theming or the

00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,420
testing until the previous fuzzy is

00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:50,820
everything finished and finally you

00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:53,520
deploy everything the full project on

00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:57,090
the other hand there's a the agile

00:01:53,520 --> 00:02:02,070
methodology the agile the agile workflow

00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:04,200
that let you develop a group of features

00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:07,920
and you would release a group of

00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:10,319
features every spring so you can be

00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,310
developing at the same time that the

00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:15,690
designer is go

00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:19,110
so you can be doing several things at

00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:22,530
the same time another thing that I would

00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:26,190
like to remind is that web project a

00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:29,790
lifetime of a web project never ends

00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:32,640
when you deploy your project when you

00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:36,360
learn to dollar the website after it

00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:40,980
there's the maintenance moment and you

00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:43,500
if you haven't had if you haven't gotten

00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:45,420
a good coat it will be really hard to

00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:49,769
find it it will be really hard to

00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:53,940
maintain everything and another another

00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:58,220
thing that it will it will be really

00:02:53,940 --> 00:03:02,910
good to remember is that science know

00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:07,019
most of us have been using static del

00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:11,790
rebels with the liver Photoshop PDF PNG

00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:14,340
images but they are not responsive they

00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:16,650
don't have interactions at the end they

00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:20,040
are not on the browser so they are not

00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:23,910
the real thing that the visitor of the

00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:26,730
website will see at the end so wishes

00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:29,579
think if the client really want a

00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:33,359
photoshop because they are just used to

00:03:29,579 --> 00:03:37,069
that because they are used that it's a

00:03:33,359 --> 00:03:40,230
standard but it's not the best option

00:03:37,069 --> 00:03:43,350
but well how can we improve all that

00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:46,859
things with components what is a

00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:49,310
component component is any predefined

00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:53,430
object whose evil across multiple pages

00:03:49,310 --> 00:04:00,450
it can be also known as widget block

00:03:53,430 --> 00:04:03,870
module it's an independent entity and it

00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:06,780
has its own meaning it has it own it own

00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:10,889
part for example in that case we it has

00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:14,010
a title it has a list it has a read more

00:04:10,889 --> 00:04:17,389
button but it's independent from the

00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:22,340
other parts of that will be in the

00:04:17,389 --> 00:04:25,879
in the in the page y components are

00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:29,840
unimproved an improvement for us because

00:04:25,879 --> 00:04:32,990
may components can make systems modular

00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:37,999
and assist them to be modular it must

00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:40,930
have interchangeable parts and what

00:04:37,999 --> 00:04:44,629
makes a company modular first we need a

00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:47,240
standard and share the design to across

00:04:44,629 --> 00:04:49,819
the project that will across the website

00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:52,370
it means that you have to take it into

00:04:49,819 --> 00:04:55,039
account when you are designing you have

00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:56,990
to design thinking on components it's

00:04:55,039 --> 00:04:59,479
really really important it comes from

00:04:56,990 --> 00:05:02,180
the beginning of the project it also

00:04:59,479 --> 00:05:06,199
have it also needs to have a centralized

00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:08,629
code because you are using if you have

00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:12,259
centralized called central aight school

00:05:08,629 --> 00:05:15,110
you only will use ones that gold you

00:05:12,259 --> 00:05:17,120
don't will write code the same code

00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:19,129
again and again and again and then you

00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:22,069
will have to maintain several pieces of

00:05:19,129 --> 00:05:25,610
content you just have to use one of them

00:05:22,069 --> 00:05:28,310
and another thing is that it should be

00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:30,560
controlled via system via the system not

00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:35,270
the user the user should and control it

00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:37,849
and it will have customers customizable

00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:39,949
options the user for example should be

00:05:37,849 --> 00:05:43,279
able to have to decide if it's a list

00:05:39,949 --> 00:05:45,710
yeah I want for example two things two

00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:48,199
items in the list or three items in the

00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:49,969
list for example it's really really

00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:52,039
important that we give some tools to the

00:05:49,969 --> 00:05:57,409
user but not become a complete control

00:05:52,039 --> 00:05:59,479
to it to it here we have an example as I

00:05:57,409 --> 00:06:02,240
was saying we can have the same

00:05:59,479 --> 00:06:05,020
component in that case is our testimony

00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:10,969
on our testimonial it's another real

00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:15,409
example here we have a testimonial with

00:06:10,969 --> 00:06:18,439
one item for example or with three items

00:06:15,409 --> 00:06:22,069
depending on the case or in the place we

00:06:18,439 --> 00:06:24,649
are putting it for example here as you

00:06:22,069 --> 00:06:27,740
can see there's the same component on

00:06:24,649 --> 00:06:30,830
the sidebar we only need one item

00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:33,350
because it's smaller it will not need

00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:36,680
more attention but for example if want

00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:39,350
to put it in the central part of the

00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:42,230
page because we want more importance to

00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:46,580
that component the user can decide if he

00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:51,650
uses for example one of the items in on

00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:54,550
it and if you have to remember once

00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:57,470
light of this presentation is that one

00:06:54,550 --> 00:07:00,770
we are not designing pages we are

00:06:57,470 --> 00:07:07,630
designing systems of components this is

00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:07,630
the most important one sorry

00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:17,760
so design systems I'm pretty sure some

00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:19,500
of you already know what's that because

00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:23,610
they are all in the range in the design

00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:26,430
one no days what is the design system a

00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:29,180
design system is everything everything

00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:32,820
that makes up your project your product

00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:36,420
everything it means topography I owed

00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:39,360
agree its colors icons of course

00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:42,960
components but even calling conventions

00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:45,660
that things are also important on a on a

00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:47,310
design system because everything makes

00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:50,570
up your project of your product and

00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:54,480
everyone needs to know the same thing

00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:56,730
here you have an example of a design

00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:59,190
system here you can have the main

00:07:56,730 --> 00:08:04,380
navigation bar you can see some buttons

00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:07,620
on Bajor a breadcrumb it all have the

00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:09,990
same style here you can see another

00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:12,930
example of different components in that

00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:15,260
case they also they all have the same

00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:20,550
colors the same type I of typography

00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:23,370
same titles same styles and if you put

00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:26,070
any of them in any pain in any part of

00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:29,850
your website they will have the same

00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:32,970
style but why should we use design

00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:35,550
systems in North projects because it

00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:39,960
really will work we only have to do

00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:42,090
things wants if we use if you reuse our

00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:44,700
world we will be able to have more

00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:47,640
efficient projects and with efficient

00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:51,180
projects we have large scale of radicals

00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:55,580
so big projects we will be able to have

00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:58,710
and manage big big projects but also

00:08:55,580 --> 00:09:02,520
everybody will knows where where is

00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:05,400
everything you someone gets into your

00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:07,650
project in the middle of the development

00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:11,250
you will know where he has to find

00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:13,830
anything and also it integrates

00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:16,620
multidisciplinary workflow the tester

00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:18,690
the developer the designer it will be it

00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:20,790
will be really really good for everybody

00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:26,220
in the project

00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:30,310
well inside that design system will

00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:34,060
sometime some years of all some time ago

00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:39,400
appeared the atomic design concept it

00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:42,580
goes it's a methodology it was a great

00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:44,410
created or invented by Brad first I

00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:48,160
don't know if some of you already know

00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:50,740
who's Brad frost his uh yeah because

00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:53,110
he's a really important she's a really

00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:56,020
good front-end developer he has our blog

00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:58,840
he also writes usually and he was going

00:09:56,020 --> 00:10:02,650
to launch our launcher and a book about

00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:05,560
that what he says is that when you are

00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:09,310
building a design system when we are

00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:12,160
designing your website you don't have to

00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:14,830
start with pages which we should usually

00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:18,210
start with the smaller pieces of your

00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:21,910
website with atoms and then you should

00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:26,020
put together atoms and build molecules

00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:29,680
and putting together molecules then you

00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:31,510
build organisms with different organisms

00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:34,420
together you want you build templates

00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:37,510
and finally you build pages but you

00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:41,080
don't start with pages here we have an

00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:44,290
example we have level some levels with

00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:47,980
some inputs if we put them together we

00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:51,280
have a form it will be the typical form

00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:53,170
and pull ha it will be a molecule if we

00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:56,170
put them that molecule inside an

00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:59,940
organism it we will have for example a

00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:59,940
comment in the comments

00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:05,730
organism it will have in that case we

00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:09,900
have the form we have another common

00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:12,960
already sent so it will be a northern

00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:16,110
ism that you can put inside the template

00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:18,650
for example it will pull the node

00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:22,350
template with the comments at the bottom

00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:24,930
so here you have that simply and finally

00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:26,550
you are there all the things that the

00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:28,350
other passes and parts of the page

00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:30,870
already have and you finally have the

00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:35,490
page but you start on the smaller piece

00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:37,680
and that's a key and the big question is

00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:43,080
when should we introduce that workflow

00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:46,830
in our projects well it's not that it's

00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:49,770
not there's no best option but for sure

00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:52,230
as soon as you can you should implement

00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:57,510
you it in your project as soon as you

00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:59,610
can for example on we're friends it's a

00:11:57,510 --> 00:12:04,290
really good moment to introduce the

00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:06,840
components way of thinking in that my

00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:10,950
friends we can choose between static why

00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:13,860
friends or HTML we're friends we choose

00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:17,010
static we're friends the promise that

00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:19,860
they are full of they are abstractions

00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:22,290
they are not the real thing that the

00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:24,810
final user or the customer will see at

00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:27,060
the end because you are not in the

00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:30,870
browser you are for example in a PDF or

00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:35,670
in an image so you can click there they

00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:39,660
are full of assumptions for example you

00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:41,600
design a wireframe you put the typical

00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:43,830
main menu but you don't develop

00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:46,130
drop-down menu because you think it's

00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:49,410
not needed but the client the client

00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:53,040
doesn't see it at kiss he thinks that it

00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:56,520
will be a drop down menu but he has he

00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:58,980
can't test it so he won't know or he

00:12:56,520 --> 00:13:03,150
won't remember about asking it and at

00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:05,340
the end you will have the website ready

00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:06,540
for lunch and he will say where's my

00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:09,210
drop-down menu

00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:11,760
hmm no known there's no drop down we

00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:14,550
haven't designed it member my friends or

00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:17,040
own design I but I want to drop down

00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:20,940
menu everybody has a drop down menu so

00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:23,430
it's full of static wire frames are full

00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:25,830
of our perceptions there can be problems

00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:29,070
with that and also they are never

00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:32,070
complete because you won't design

00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:34,590
everything and now you know in a static

00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:37,230
wireframe on the other hand you have the

00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:40,350
HTML wireframes and the good thing on

00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:42,330
that is that they get quicker into the

00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:44,640
browser because you are doing it and in

00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:46,710
the browser also they reinforce the

00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:48,770
notion that you're creating a website

00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:51,480
because you are doing it in a browser

00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:52,800
they are also interactive because you're

00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:54,920
in a browser there will be as

00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:57,890
interactive as you as you won't they are

00:13:54,920 --> 00:14:01,380
they also allow annotations that

00:13:57,890 --> 00:14:03,750
something that sometimes well it concern

00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:06,450
us that we won't be able to annotate

00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:09,900
annotate something there they also let

00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:12,570
it and also they will be the base of the

00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:16,980
final project product and it's really

00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:21,390
important ok if you have enough lamented

00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:26,880
components on your on your boyfriend's

00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:30,510
process you can do it on your design on

00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:33,000
the earth design you can have the

00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:36,840
typical static deliverables like

00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:40,620
Photoshop images PDF or you can have

00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:45,420
axiom XML their deli rebels you can have

00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:49,290
prototypes if you decide if you choose

00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:51,810
prototypes you can design in the browser

00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:53,640
what does that mean it doesn't means

00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:56,760
that you have to start with a white

00:14:53,640 --> 00:15:00,180
blank page ack tml white blank page no

00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:01,770
it's not that you are if your design if

00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:04,530
you're a designer you may be our

00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:07,500
thinking I can start with a blank HTML

00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:11,400
page it means that you really have to

00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:14,700
use Photoshop or whatever you use in the

00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:17,190
planning phase in the research research

00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:18,420
phases and then you make your

00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:21,000
composition in

00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:23,579
browser what does that mean that you

00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,230
make decisions in the browser and that's

00:15:23,579 --> 00:15:28,709
really really really important because

00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:31,230
you will decide when the breakpoint will

00:15:28,709 --> 00:15:34,260
come because you are doing it you are

00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:36,930
having it just right in front of you so

00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:39,600
you will decide it's it looks good or no

00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:42,360
it doesn't looks good and of course they

00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:45,449
are reusable work the developer will

00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:47,519
know how do you want your output how do

00:15:45,449 --> 00:15:51,149
you work what which classes do you want

00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:55,519
which levels do you want for example so

00:15:51,149 --> 00:15:55,519
it's really really really useful

00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:04,320
sorry

00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:08,620
okay another important part about

00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:12,220
components are CSS methodologies because

00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:15,250
they led to us mccaskill evil and

00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:17,380
maintain evil a front-end code and it

00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:20,710
really really really important to ugly

00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:24,100
and eating our projects on one hand we

00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:26,670
have object-oriented CSS it has already

00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:28,900
some years it's based on the

00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:32,620
object-oriented program programming

00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:36,160
paradigm what it says is that your

00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:38,530
object should do one thing well it will

00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:41,230
be if you have only one responsibility

00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:44,200
and one class for that responsibility

00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:47,380
and it will have it will be focused on

00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:53,620
the separation of concerns because every

00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:56,410
section should have its own classes this

00:16:53,620 --> 00:17:00,010
is an example the typical example of an

00:16:56,410 --> 00:17:04,870
object it will be media for the media

00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:07,720
object so if you want to seem anything

00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:12,670
inside the media object you just have to

00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:15,610
have use you just use the media and

00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:17,709
whatever is inside so that's the only

00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:22,630
thing you have to take into account with

00:17:17,709 --> 00:17:25,030
object-oriented seasons then block

00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:29,470
element modifier it's a naming

00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:31,780
methodology it's an abstraction what it

00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:34,930
does is for example you have a company

00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:39,130
or a block or model or widget whatever

00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:43,390
you want to call it and you put a name

00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:48,280
on him you say site search for example

00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:51,250
and you use the element so a muddy field

00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:55,180
modify that class for example if you

00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:57,430
want to put a field inside the side

00:17:55,180 --> 00:18:00,760
search you will do you will do site

00:17:57,430 --> 00:18:03,400
search underscore underscore field what

00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:06,280
that does is that when you call it from

00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:09,220
your CSS code code you are calling it

00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:12,570
directly to and you are not using Site

00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:15,600
Search as a space

00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:17,880
field you are using directly site search

00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:20,759
underscore underscore field or for

00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:23,610
example if you are modifying your site

00:18:20,759 --> 00:18:26,220
search search / key because you have two

00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:29,690
of them here for example you have the

00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:33,289
full one then the modifiers goes with

00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:36,360
diced Asheville that's a really

00:18:33,289 --> 00:18:39,299
important way and a real improvement to

00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:43,769
use directly that glass to style

00:18:39,299 --> 00:18:46,289
everything on your CSS or SAS here for

00:18:43,769 --> 00:18:50,250
example we have another we have an

00:18:46,289 --> 00:18:53,519
example of an act EML output it will be

00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:55,200
the block name and you have you can have

00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:58,950
a rapper that it's also something

00:18:55,200 --> 00:19:01,559
related to the to the to the block then

00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:04,379
with Google half block name underscore

00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:06,899
underscore rapper or the title will be

00:19:04,379 --> 00:19:09,240
blog name underscore underscore title it

00:19:06,899 --> 00:19:13,129
really easy to implement and it really

00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:16,350
helps a lot plete me it really helps

00:19:13,129 --> 00:19:19,230
then on the other hand we have smacks

00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:23,330
it's more like an style guide than a

00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:25,740
rigid CSS from framework what it to z's

00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:29,789
recommends you how you should divide

00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:35,940
your files for example you should have a

00:19:29,789 --> 00:19:41,009
base file with everything like phone

00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:43,950
style the size of the of the phone the

00:19:41,009 --> 00:19:46,740
the color of the links the margins of

00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:48,899
the least it will be evil database for

00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:51,539
example then you can you should have

00:19:48,899 --> 00:19:54,299
another file with the layout and

00:19:51,539 --> 00:19:57,330
everything that is related to the layout

00:19:54,299 --> 00:20:00,690
for example two columns three columns

00:19:57,330 --> 00:20:03,720
responsive whatever it will be in the

00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:07,019
layout then you will have the module or

00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:11,519
components in another way in another

00:20:07,019 --> 00:20:15,899
folder or file and finally the state so

00:20:11,519 --> 00:20:20,200
what you do is divide the files and you

00:20:15,899 --> 00:20:23,100
put everything in that in its part

00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:23,100
then

00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:33,549
another really really useful thing for

00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:39,480
and working on with components is having

00:20:33,549 --> 00:20:42,130
style lights if you haven't introduced

00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:45,070
components earlier in your project

00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:47,470
product in your project I really

00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:50,350
recommend you that you do it on on the

00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:52,360
style guide moment most of you I'm

00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:55,419
pretty sure all of you are sometimes

00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:57,940
have seen are the typical style right

00:20:55,419 --> 00:21:02,020
the PDF started I that someone's deliver

00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:04,120
you with the design and today it could

00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:07,380
it does it visualize your cold and

00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:11,649
represent it as a ue component tool kit

00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:16,630
it's a style guide is the documentation

00:21:11,649 --> 00:21:19,120
of a design system it's just a list or

00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:21,760
about everything that you will have in

00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:25,630
your website for example here we have

00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:28,419
our colors then we will have our colors

00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:32,440
inside that style guide here is an

00:21:28,419 --> 00:21:34,299
example from government that UK and you

00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:36,640
have a list of all the stuff all the

00:21:34,299 --> 00:21:38,860
colors here and you have a list of all

00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:43,000
the titles and other lists for all the

00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:45,820
components why should we use style

00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:48,520
guides on your workflow because they

00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:51,820
improve the user experience for example

00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:55,149
imagine that you have a website and your

00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:58,539
hair you have there you have a help link

00:21:55,149 --> 00:22:02,320
then you click on that it opens a pop-up

00:21:58,539 --> 00:22:04,750
and in any other place it doesn't open a

00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:07,059
pop-up it goes to another place for the

00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:09,940
user is not good that if you have an a

00:22:07,059 --> 00:22:12,669
style guide that it says hold to like

00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:14,919
the the Help button what rule happens

00:22:12,669 --> 00:22:16,899
every time you are click on a Help

00:22:14,919 --> 00:22:19,120
button if you will have the same

00:22:16,899 --> 00:22:21,480
experience across all the website and

00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:23,950
its really really important for the user

00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:26,799
another thing that really helped me that

00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:29,010
it that it makes easier the young

00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:31,690
boarding of new team members because

00:22:29,010 --> 00:22:34,270
everybody who knows where they have to

00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:37,230
find everything everybody knows where is

00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:39,340
everything and they know where to find

00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:43,780
anything that they are really

00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:46,570
no of course it makes efficient or

00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:48,970
design or development and it makes

00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:52,030
really easier the testing and its really

00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:54,910
important because the tester sometimes

00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:57,730
doesn't know where to find that the good

00:22:54,910 --> 00:23:01,330
code because it has changed store during

00:22:57,730 --> 00:23:03,280
the development the standard wood and if

00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:06,100
you have an ax style light he will know

00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:08,500
that that the thing that there's in the

00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:11,530
style guide it will be the good one so

00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:16,810
it will be easier to to know if it's

00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:19,780
fine or no so if we have even wore a

00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:23,050
waterfall or agile project or whatever

00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:25,270
is your workflow for each piece for each

00:23:23,050 --> 00:23:27,670
feature you have to go from the wire

00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:30,010
friend to design after the devil you

00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:33,610
have to have to develop it and then

00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:36,730
launch it to production if you want to

00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:39,040
make any change you have to go back go

00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:41,440
to design design it again develop again

00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:43,930
and go out and go to production again

00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:46,710
what if you introduce here in style

00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:49,930
right well you have to design develop

00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:52,450
production oh no who have to change add

00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:55,450
something you go back to design you'll

00:23:52,450 --> 00:23:57,580
design everything then you go back to

00:23:55,450 --> 00:24:00,040
development and you say to the developer

00:23:57,580 --> 00:24:03,790
eight please so daedalus tighe light on

00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:06,130
forget it it's really important but you

00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:09,460
are on time you are not on time you have

00:24:06,130 --> 00:24:13,330
a lot of brush and you forget about the

00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:16,300
style guide well style guides there are

00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:18,490
out of date are really useless if we

00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:22,060
were if we are not going to happen up

00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:24,670
done not today the style guide it won't

00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:30,480
work at least at the end of the above

00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:33,710
the project will be equal even work so

00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:36,660
style guide driven development it's

00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:39,900
something that really solves that style

00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:42,720
guides it means that there are Stylites

00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:45,390
that are generated directly from the

00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:47,880
definition resources for example from

00:24:45,390 --> 00:24:50,130
your sass if you are using cells you can

00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:53,059
generate your style guides from there

00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:53,059
for example

00:24:57,789 --> 00:25:05,649
what we are using on our projects is

00:25:01,659 --> 00:25:09,549
Caius s9 stylesheet it's something that

00:25:05,649 --> 00:25:13,359
it's already launched with the Zen

00:25:09,549 --> 00:25:16,649
module the new lounge then six I don't

00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:21,519
know if some of you already use it it

00:25:16,649 --> 00:25:25,659
these are really useful tool it's an

00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:28,090
automatic style guide and it's in

00:25:25,659 --> 00:25:30,759
documentation specification and a study

00:25:28,090 --> 00:25:33,070
date format inside your sass that you

00:25:30,759 --> 00:25:36,309
just put it on on the sass and it

00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:39,489
creates automatically and it's wrapped

00:25:36,309 --> 00:25:44,379
everything and creates a style guide for

00:25:39,489 --> 00:25:46,629
you I'm going to splain it for example

00:25:44,379 --> 00:25:49,450
you have what I was saying just before

00:25:46,629 --> 00:25:52,599
about the smacks you have your by your

00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:55,119
base coat your base styles then you have

00:25:52,599 --> 00:25:56,859
another folder with the layout then you

00:25:55,119 --> 00:26:00,749
have the folder with components for

00:25:56,859 --> 00:26:05,139
example and we go to the pager component

00:26:00,749 --> 00:26:08,289
you have the you have the file in that

00:26:05,139 --> 00:26:10,929
case yeah we use a SAS then you have a

00:26:08,289 --> 00:26:14,499
sass file and in the same folder you

00:26:10,929 --> 00:26:18,460
have an HBS file I'm going to splain it

00:26:14,499 --> 00:26:22,359
in your pictures for in your pager SAS

00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:25,269
you have that code you have the name of

00:26:22,359 --> 00:26:28,659
the of the component then you have the

00:26:25,269 --> 00:26:33,669
markup you'll link here to the picture

00:26:28,659 --> 00:26:36,999
dot HBS a file that is in your in your

00:26:33,669 --> 00:26:39,639
folder in the same folder and you say it

00:26:36,999 --> 00:26:43,499
here that that component will be inside

00:26:39,639 --> 00:26:46,299
components navigation dot folder and

00:26:43,499 --> 00:26:50,019
that's all then of course you have to

00:26:46,299 --> 00:26:54,600
make your coat your style there and then

00:26:50,019 --> 00:26:58,240
you create that nice

00:26:54,600 --> 00:27:05,850
HTML do you just put it inside the pager

00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:08,650
dot H vs file you'll run the cool

00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:10,840
automated thing and you have the pager

00:27:08,650 --> 00:27:13,420
on your style light it will run

00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:16,360
automatically what does it means that

00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:18,520
you are creating your coat your styling

00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:21,070
and at the same time you are bull you

00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:24,610
are building the style guide so we won't

00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:28,660
be out of date never unless you are

00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:31,930
doing it intentionally if you want more

00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:34,780
information about style guides you can

00:27:31,930 --> 00:27:37,540
go to style guides dot io there are a

00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:40,030
lot of resources there article books

00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:44,320
whatever so I'm worried there's a lot of

00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:46,420
information and well how we do

00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:50,760
everything all that things in Drupal

00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:55,390
because as you may know Drupal is not

00:27:50,760 --> 00:28:00,130
seeming free only it's not the dvds free

00:27:55,390 --> 00:28:03,670
only or classy differently so we have

00:28:00,130 --> 00:28:06,370
two general approaches we can grow up

00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:09,070
grab components or we can change the

00:28:06,370 --> 00:28:12,220
full markup week or we can do both of

00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:17,560
them but there are that general

00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:21,430
approaches if we want to change our

00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:25,360
components to your drupal components

00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:27,940
adapted to components itself that you

00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:30,910
buy my half on your style light or in

00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:33,580
your prototypes you can choose three

00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:37,180
ways you can use do you can do it by

00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:40,510
code you can do it by through this place

00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:43,840
suite or you can use panels if you are

00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:47,050
going to you do it in using code you can

00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:49,840
use feel for matters you can use pre

00:28:47,050 --> 00:28:51,790
process and process functions but you

00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:53,920
have to know how everything works and

00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:57,580
which one hour you will need to use and

00:28:53,920 --> 00:29:01,210
of course you can use hook page out dark

00:28:57,580 --> 00:29:03,620
for malta who'd not be water whatever or

00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:06,530
you can create your custom functions

00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:09,380
but it's you have to know a lot of thing

00:29:06,530 --> 00:29:12,110
you have to have a lot of knowledge

00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:15,410
about drupal theming Andrew Paul

00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:18,770
fronting on the other hand you have this

00:29:15,410 --> 00:29:20,870
place with I really like it it's really

00:29:18,770 --> 00:29:24,890
easy you can you just have boom modes

00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:27,380
and you design your you customize your

00:29:24,890 --> 00:29:30,470
view modes and you reuse your view modes

00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:34,160
and here you have a component so you are

00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:37,400
we are you can we can reuse it but also

00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:41,120
display suite has filton plates on that

00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:44,450
displays with extras module and if we do

00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:48,770
it we can change all the markup from all

00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:51,380
our fields we can to choose the expert

00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:53,300
mode and here we can put there we can

00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:57,290
change the mark-up we can change the

00:29:53,300 --> 00:30:01,790
classes it it open it all puts so we can

00:29:57,290 --> 00:30:04,120
have a lot of control over or HTML at

00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:04,120
the end

00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:15,230
sorry

00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:18,380
and finally we have panels I really

00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:20,810
hated panels on some years ago because

00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:24,680
that's who i thought it was a huge huge

00:30:20,810 --> 00:30:29,570
huge module that really just give a lot

00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:31,310
of problems but on lately every I i

00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:36,380
discovered that it's really really

00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:40,700
useful for components on one hand you

00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:43,480
can use custom pins custom pains or it

00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:46,910
can be also known as little settles

00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:49,760
content type or plugin what you do is

00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:51,770
you create this like creating a block if

00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:55,250
you have you ever created a block

00:30:51,770 --> 00:30:57,920
program at licking programmatically my

00:30:55,250 --> 00:31:04,580
English is not really good sorry you

00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:09,860
just create the DA you just use the

00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:13,250
function hook themes admin info or sorry

00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:16,520
you just use the the function hook and

00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:19,280
meaningful and the other one hook render

00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:22,940
and you just create your plug-in and you

00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:25,100
will have it on your panels interface to

00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:27,260
choose it and it will recreate it for

00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:30,650
you so we it will have the output you

00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:34,010
one on the other hand you can create

00:31:30,650 --> 00:31:37,790
custom templates you can use you can

00:31:34,010 --> 00:31:40,850
create a panel a pain on your interface

00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:45,800
inside Drupal and just change the data

00:31:40,850 --> 00:31:49,610
in plate another really easy way is just

00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:51,920
adding a class to a panel pin and then

00:31:49,610 --> 00:31:54,260
just seemed everything inside it it's

00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:56,930
really really easy you just have to do

00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:59,210
it on the paper says in on the

00:31:56,930 --> 00:32:01,550
preprocessed function represents panel

00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:04,310
pain function this function is the key

00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:07,130
you can do it on the template dot PHP

00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:12,400
from yours on your theme or whatever and

00:32:07,130 --> 00:32:16,840
then use you in any in any case in any

00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:20,070
for it not case my pain name for example

00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:23,740
you choose that and in that case you use

00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:26,170
the classes you want in that case is my

00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:28,960
custom play class and then your pain

00:32:26,170 --> 00:32:31,780
will have it and you will be able to

00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:35,680
style whatever you want however however

00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:39,190
you want another thing that panels give

00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:41,410
us is mini panels it's really easy

00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:43,770
because you do everything through the

00:32:41,410 --> 00:32:49,110
interface it's broken play and you just

00:32:43,770 --> 00:32:51,910
add some different in that case we have

00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:54,070
social media icons you can have any

00:32:51,910 --> 00:32:56,170
other thing inside here and you have a

00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:59,500
minute panel then you can add it

00:32:56,170 --> 00:33:02,200
whatever you use your pain in a pan up

00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:04,690
be in a panel page or in a pimp analyzer

00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:07,600
or whatever and then you have a group

00:33:04,690 --> 00:33:11,800
thing that you can you reuse whatever in

00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:16,450
your in your project and finally panels

00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:21,400
give us also context context can is for

00:33:16,450 --> 00:33:24,070
example if you are in content type if

00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:27,730
you are in an article you will have for

00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:33,670
example at least with three items or if

00:33:27,730 --> 00:33:37,390
I am Jana Banin article or in a simple

00:33:33,670 --> 00:33:42,550
page you can have for example 5 News

00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:45,070
faithfully last news so depending

00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:48,520
depending on the context the top panel

00:33:45,070 --> 00:33:55,650
the content can change and it will help

00:33:48,520 --> 00:34:00,580
us so that's all that's everything about

00:33:55,650 --> 00:34:02,410
components and I think I'm on time so if

00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:06,400
you want to learn a little bit more

00:34:02,410 --> 00:34:09,909
about any other related things with that

00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:12,159
you can go to other two sessions related

00:34:09,909 --> 00:34:15,340
you can go to the repulsion generated

00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:17,860
markup is not your friend use a style

00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:20,409
guide so they will explain a little bit

00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:22,600
more of that and another one I recommend

00:34:20,409 --> 00:34:24,860
you is prototypes and Drupal from

00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:29,660
designing the browser to implementing

00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:33,170
some templates so thank you for coming

00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:36,590
and thank you too msf that let me use

00:34:33,170 --> 00:34:42,160
their the examples from our customer and

00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:42,160
if you have any question that's all

00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:54,210
hi um I have a question about Klaus

00:34:48,629 --> 00:34:57,690
naming i'm actually a back-end developer

00:34:54,210 --> 00:35:01,950
so not really a front-end person but I

00:34:57,690 --> 00:35:04,170
talk a lot to front end people and so I

00:35:01,950 --> 00:35:05,760
come from very structured way of working

00:35:04,170 --> 00:35:07,710
and they have a structured way of

00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:10,859
working sometimes they have trouble

00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:14,250
coming up with naming convention for all

00:35:10,859 --> 00:35:16,650
of the classes that is that doesn't go

00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:19,140
out of control so I wonder if you have

00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:22,290
any tips for naming conventions inside

00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:24,570
bem for example yeah he's asking if

00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:26,099
what's the best way for the naming

00:35:24,570 --> 00:35:28,859
conventions because he's back in

00:35:26,099 --> 00:35:32,490
delicate and he says that here usually

00:35:28,859 --> 00:35:36,079
have troubles to go to to a common way

00:35:32,490 --> 00:35:40,800
of naming i will recommend you use bem

00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:48,089
bem is what i was saying a really good

00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:50,760
and easy way to put classes and it helps

00:35:48,089 --> 00:35:52,560
you hope you put a class but it doesn't

00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:55,560
says you which is a name of the

00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:58,770
component you have to decide it and the

00:35:55,560 --> 00:36:02,130
most i think the clever way to decide it

00:35:58,770 --> 00:36:06,540
is too abstract as much as you can

00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:09,750
you're a component and to think all the

00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:12,710
all the times it will appear if for

00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:17,040
example you have a call to action button

00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:19,260
think where it will go placed and when

00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:21,000
you have all the older all the

00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:23,430
situations you will have it then decide

00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:29,690
not just on the first time it appears

00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:29,690
just have a a big image of it

00:36:29,699 --> 00:36:36,789
hi next one um I was just wondering cuz

00:36:34,569 --> 00:36:40,179
i was using chaos as on one of my less

00:36:36,789 --> 00:36:43,089
projects and thing was that throughout

00:36:40,179 --> 00:36:45,759
the project sometimes you want to change

00:36:43,089 --> 00:36:47,890
the mark-up but if you're already in the

00:36:45,759 --> 00:36:50,529
project you constantly have to change

00:36:47,890 --> 00:36:53,679
twig and then you're also maintaining

00:36:50,529 --> 00:36:56,109
the HBS file do you have a better way or

00:36:53,679 --> 00:36:59,009
do you maintain those two files where

00:36:56,109 --> 00:37:01,839
you keep the mark-up in sync or can you

00:36:59,009 --> 00:37:06,489
there a better way of doing it or no we

00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:08,469
also your site HBS because I think if at

00:37:06,489 --> 00:37:12,819
least for us is that the easier way

00:37:08,469 --> 00:37:16,029
because we we we try to keep the good

00:37:12,819 --> 00:37:18,369
one as the hvs then all the other ones

00:37:16,029 --> 00:37:21,429
should bury from that but that's a

00:37:18,369 --> 00:37:23,289
that's a good one because otherwise you

00:37:21,429 --> 00:37:26,140
are developing something and you only

00:37:23,289 --> 00:37:28,900
you know which is the good one if you

00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:32,109
and if you don't update your HBS then

00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:35,799
you can have that travels I know we

00:37:32,109 --> 00:37:39,900
always try to use that the HBS or having

00:37:35,799 --> 00:37:42,429
at least two three samples on HBS but

00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:45,729
there is the central is the central

00:37:42,429 --> 00:37:48,239
thing isn't the central component okay

00:37:45,729 --> 00:37:48,239
thanks

00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:54,459
and the other question

00:37:52,539 --> 00:37:56,109
do you have a document at the higher

00:37:54,459 --> 00:37:58,509
level where you work with your client

00:37:56,109 --> 00:37:59,919
and say you can't design a new page you

00:37:58,509 --> 00:38:01,719
need to work from these components and

00:37:59,919 --> 00:38:03,609
these components work in this way and

00:38:01,719 --> 00:38:04,390
this is why we use them do you do you

00:38:03,609 --> 00:38:06,099
actually take it up so you don't

00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:07,900
actually go back to the design phase you

00:38:06,099 --> 00:38:10,089
say here's our style guide he has a

00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:12,849
catalog please choose from the available

00:38:10,089 --> 00:38:15,609
options you mean how do you say that to

00:38:12,849 --> 00:38:17,349
your body and client so they don't get

00:38:15,609 --> 00:38:19,390
to design because the worst thing a big

00:38:17,349 --> 00:38:21,339
site is all your neck sign your page but

00:38:19,390 --> 00:38:23,439
actually what you say is well here are

00:38:21,339 --> 00:38:26,009
the components can you please choose

00:38:23,439 --> 00:38:29,049
from the ones we've already made well

00:38:26,009 --> 00:38:33,219
that's a good question you'd never have

00:38:29,049 --> 00:38:36,189
well it's you that's not so useful to

00:38:33,219 --> 00:38:37,749
have that good client that understands

00:38:36,189 --> 00:38:39,939
everything and when you suggest

00:38:37,749 --> 00:38:42,910
something he says okay I'm going to

00:38:39,939 --> 00:38:46,839
change my mind and I'm going to do that

00:38:42,910 --> 00:38:50,439
that's really really really difficult to

00:38:46,839 --> 00:38:52,299
do it but i think that at the end you

00:38:50,439 --> 00:38:54,160
have to choose that clients that really

00:38:52,299 --> 00:38:58,839
listen you because they want to improve

00:38:54,160 --> 00:39:02,559
also and at the end if you I think the

00:38:58,839 --> 00:39:05,229
best way to say to a client hey that's

00:39:02,559 --> 00:39:08,529
the best way doing things with with

00:39:05,229 --> 00:39:12,999
components is showing them money and any

00:39:08,529 --> 00:39:15,219
example of any other customer and take

00:39:12,999 --> 00:39:19,869
him maybe they already design it

00:39:15,219 --> 00:39:23,079
anything say okay just let me check take

00:39:19,869 --> 00:39:26,199
some piece of that and let me move it to

00:39:23,079 --> 00:39:30,369
any other place does it works here no

00:39:26,199 --> 00:39:32,619
okay we call we could do it work so I

00:39:30,369 --> 00:39:34,989
don't know you should try to convince

00:39:32,619 --> 00:39:37,509
but it's really difficult usually but if

00:39:34,989 --> 00:39:40,749
you go with our prototype or with an

00:39:37,509 --> 00:39:44,289
axiom my friends usually one day's see

00:39:40,749 --> 00:39:47,880
that they can touch whatever it is it's

00:39:44,289 --> 00:39:47,880
usually it's really good

00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:56,270
