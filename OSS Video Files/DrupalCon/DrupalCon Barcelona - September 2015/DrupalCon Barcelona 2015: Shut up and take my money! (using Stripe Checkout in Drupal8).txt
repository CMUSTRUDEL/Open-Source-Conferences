Title: DrupalCon Barcelona 2015: Shut up and take my money! (using Stripe Checkout in Drupal8)
Publication date: 2015-09-22
Playlist: DrupalCon Barcelona - September 2015
Description: 
	If you want to accept payments on your site and have the simplest path to PCI compliance the Stripe Checkout solution gets you there. It uses a simple HTML embed code and a custom callback to make charges to the userâ€™s credit card. In this session we talk about how we coded a custom Drupal 8 module to render the HTML embed code on a standard integer field (as a field formatter) that can be placed on any content type. Then we will look at how the module can be used in your sites and how it can be compared to other solutions such as Payment module and Drupal Commerce.
