Title: DrupalCon Barcelona 2015: Estimation: from waterfall to agile
Publication date: 2015-09-22
Playlist: DrupalCon Barcelona - September 2015
Description: 
	The presentation will describe how and why Adapt has transformed our methodologies from a classic waterfall approach over semi agile process to now implementing a full-on agile SCRUM inspired approach to working with Drupal projects.

 

The presentation does not aim to present a “This is how you do it-guide” but rather present some of the challenges we’ve experienced and how we have tried solve them.

We want to show some of the mistakes we’ve made and what we’ve learned from them.

 

One of the areas we want to cover is the classic “know what you don’t know” approach to estimating and how we changed from early micro estimation that very fast became obsolete to Story Points.

Adapt is an agency developing Drupal solutions for stakeholders with various levels of development insights.
