00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:07,529
think that your pecan stands out because

00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:09,740
of the people that come to the Rubicon

00:00:07,529 --> 00:00:13,860
it's really a community and not just

00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:15,809
another technology conference year after

00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:18,330
year you get to know people you become

00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:19,980
friends maybe see each other not even

00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:22,769
just at DrupalCon but this is a great

00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:24,160
time to reconnect and find out what's

00:00:22,769 --> 00:00:24,970
been going on in the past year

00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,079
[Music]

00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:28,079
[Applause]

00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:32,290
we sponsor DrupalCon

00:00:30,279 --> 00:00:34,629
early because we have been part of this

00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:36,910
community since the beginning and very

00:00:34,629 --> 00:00:39,340
involved in it it's great to come and

00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:41,320
meet companies meet other you know

00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:43,059
potential clients and also meet current

00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:44,769
clients but it's also about the

00:00:43,059 --> 00:00:46,420
community and staying involved in the

00:00:44,769 --> 00:00:54,309
community as a whole and supporting open

00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:57,220
source there's the obvious business

00:00:54,309 --> 00:00:59,980
value it's our biggest Legion tool of

00:00:57,220 --> 00:01:01,690
any of our marketing campaigns we're

00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:03,609
able to develop relationships that we

00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:06,640
already have but we're also able to

00:01:03,609 --> 00:01:08,200
build new ones in addition to that and I

00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,300
think what's most important to myself

00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:12,340
from the founders is what it does for

00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:14,560
the community like this community got us

00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:16,210
to where we are and for us at this

00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,740
annual event is a celebration of that

00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:18,560
and sort of a renewal of that

00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:23,500
relationship

00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:25,560
