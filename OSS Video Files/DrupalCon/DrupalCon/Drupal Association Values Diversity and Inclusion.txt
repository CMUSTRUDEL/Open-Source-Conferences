Title: Drupal Association Values Diversity and Inclusion
Publication date: 2019-12-16
Playlist: DrupalCon
Description: 
	The Drupal Association and the volunteers who contribute to DrupalCon strive to make our conference an inclusive and welcoming environment for all who attend. New and unique voices create deeper conversation, and ultimately, different perspectives make for better product.

We work to increase the diversity of the speakers who take the stage(s) at DrupalCon to ensure they better represent the Drupal community. Likewise, we aim to have all who attend DrupalCon feel comfortable and welcome, no matter their gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, race, ethnicity, age, religion or economic status. 

We invite all to join us for the next DrupalCon in Minneapolis May 18 - 22, 2020. https://events.drupal.org/minneapolis2020
