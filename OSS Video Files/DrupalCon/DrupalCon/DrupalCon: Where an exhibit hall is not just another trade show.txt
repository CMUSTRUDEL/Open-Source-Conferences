Title: DrupalCon: Where an exhibit hall is not just another trade show
Publication date: 2019-12-16
Playlist: DrupalCon
Description: 
	DrupalCon brings together thousands of people from across the globe who use, develop, design, and support the Drupal platform. Exhibiting at DrupalCon is more than just a trade showâ€”it's a place to engage and interact with the expansive Drupal community. Grow existing relationships or nurture new ones! 

DrupalCon North America is the annual celebration of the community, the project, and what we can accomplish when we convene for a week of knowledge sharing, growth opportunities and enjoyment. Join us in Minneapolis May 18-22, 2020.

00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:09,230
we've met a lot of clients here at

00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:11,030
Triple Khanna sponsors and we've also

00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:12,349
met a lot of team members one of the

00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:15,409
things that always stands out in their

00:00:12,349 --> 00:00:17,509
minds is our booth and maybe some

00:00:15,409 --> 00:00:19,130
interaction that they had it's just an

00:00:17,509 --> 00:00:21,109
area that people like to come and hang

00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:22,849
out and it makes me happy to have an

00:00:21,109 --> 00:00:24,589
opportunity to interact with people in a

00:00:22,849 --> 00:00:27,740
way that it doesn't feel transactional

00:00:24,589 --> 00:00:30,439
if you work in Drupal it is the

00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:32,619
conference to sponsor so it's kind of a

00:00:30,439 --> 00:00:32,619
