Title: DrupalCon: Where an exhibit hall is not just another trade show
Publication date: 2019-12-16
Playlist: DrupalCon
Description: 
	DrupalCon brings together thousands of people from across the globe who use, develop, design, and support the Drupal platform. Exhibiting at DrupalCon is more than just a trade showâ€”it's a place to engage and interact with the expansive Drupal community. Grow existing relationships or nurture new ones! 

DrupalCon North America is the annual celebration of the community, the project, and what we can accomplish when we convene for a week of knowledge sharing, growth opportunities and enjoyment. Join us in Minneapolis May 18-22, 2020.
