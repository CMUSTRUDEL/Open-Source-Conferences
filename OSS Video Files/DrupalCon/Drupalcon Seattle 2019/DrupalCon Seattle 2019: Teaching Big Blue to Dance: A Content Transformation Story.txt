Title: DrupalCon Seattle 2019: Teaching Big Blue to Dance: A Content Transformation Story
Publication date: 2019-04-12
Playlist: Drupalcon Seattle 2019
Description: 
	IBM determined in late 2015 that it needed to transform its web content creation for www.ibm.com and move from a home-grown authoring and publishing system that had been in use for 10+ years and was no longer meeting the needs of the business to respond to rapidly changing contennt requirements.  In an embrace of open-source, IBM selected Drupal as the core of its new content management strategy.

This session will discuss:

key selection criteria that resulted in Drupal being chosen
the process that was used to evaluate Drupal and the other top contenders
the strategy for migrating from the legacy systems to Drupal
team structure and processes allowing for effecting integration of the business and technical teams
high-level architecture and design of IBM's Drupal implementation
integration of Drupal as a part of the overall Marketing Platforms ecosystem
Attending this session will allow attendees to learn up close how an enterprise website with millions of webpages, thousands of editors and dozens of business units can be transformed to a much more engaging site that can meet the demands of a rapidly changing business.  Attendees will walk away with an appreciation for the complexities of doing this type of transformation at an enterprise level and with materials that they can use in their transformations.

This session is appropriate for attendees with all levels of knowledge.  Drupal beginners and experts will all walk away with something they can use.
