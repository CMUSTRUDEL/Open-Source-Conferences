Title: DrupalCon Seattle 2019: Communities & the First Law of Drupaldynamics
Publication date: 2019-04-12
Playlist: Drupalcon Seattle 2019
Description: 
	In this session we’ll talk about the critical role strong communities play in attracting newcomers, and how we can help new Drupalists from various backgrounds and environments find their path. For Drupal to flourish we need not only a steady influx of newcomers, but of people with different experiences and backgrounds.

First Contact: How do people find Drupal? We’ll talk about our vastly different experiences in “meeting” the Drupal community to illustrate the many paths to Drupal from the outside.

Getting Started: Once you’ve been hooked on the software, then what? How can newcomers go from being interested to getting involved? We’ll cover different pathways to learning about and participating in Drupal beyond the scope of your development project.

Illustrated Value-Add: We all carry experience and knowledge from our “pre-Drupal” lives. We’ll talk about how our previous experience influences what we do every day in the Drupal community, and how the community benefits from supporting a wide array of backgrounds.

Self-Assessment: How can we ensure that:

Drupal is easy to discover

Newcomers are guided towards a healthy, welcoming community

We benefit from the experience Drupalists bring to the community

Newcomers become long-term contributors, and allies in our quest to grow Drupal
