Title: DrupalCon Seattle 2019: Communities & the First Law of Drupaldynamics
Publication date: 2019-04-12
Playlist: Drupalcon Seattle 2019
Description: 
	In this session we’ll talk about the critical role strong communities play in attracting newcomers, and how we can help new Drupalists from various backgrounds and environments find their path. For Drupal to flourish we need not only a steady influx of newcomers, but of people with different experiences and backgrounds.

First Contact: How do people find Drupal? We’ll talk about our vastly different experiences in “meeting” the Drupal community to illustrate the many paths to Drupal from the outside.

Getting Started: Once you’ve been hooked on the software, then what? How can newcomers go from being interested to getting involved? We’ll cover different pathways to learning about and participating in Drupal beyond the scope of your development project.

Illustrated Value-Add: We all carry experience and knowledge from our “pre-Drupal” lives. We’ll talk about how our previous experience influences what we do every day in the Drupal community, and how the community benefits from supporting a wide array of backgrounds.

Self-Assessment: How can we ensure that:

Drupal is easy to discover

Newcomers are guided towards a healthy, welcoming community

We benefit from the experience Drupalists bring to the community

Newcomers become long-term contributors, and allies in our quest to grow Drupal

okay all right so welcome to our

00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:06,060
communities and the first law of Drupal

00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:08,849
Dynamics talk

00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:10,500
I'm Lisa McRae we got Jack Garrett on

00:00:08,849 --> 00:00:13,530
the end there we have a chef Robin in

00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:15,269
the middle and like I said we only got

00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:19,230
half an hour so we're gonna jump right

00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:21,480
into it so the first law of Drupal

00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:24,060
Dynamics knowledge is never lost it just

00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:26,670
changes form so when we started putting

00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:28,320
this talk together we were thinking a

00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:31,610
little bit about how the three of us

00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,780
were like a microcosm of Drupal in a way

00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:37,500
we all got here from different

00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:38,910
backgrounds took different paths but our

00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:41,399
differences only made the Drupal

00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:43,640
community stronger that reminded me a

00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:46,079
lot of the first law of thermodynamics

00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:48,840
which is the one about the conservation

00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:52,469
of energy regardless of where you came

00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:55,199
from people with many kinds of skills

00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:56,699
abilities and backgrounds are valuable

00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:59,250
in the Drupal community precisely

00:00:56,699 --> 00:01:03,030
because they bring this other knowledge

00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:05,790
not in spite of it obviously we're not

00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:08,250
alone in this idea Drees talked about it

00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:10,740
this morning in histories note it's kind

00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:12,479
of it's more of a given really and the

00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:14,850
interesting part is how we keep the

00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:19,220
community growing and bringing other new

00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:21,330
people in so let's focus on that piece

00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:23,610
will each start off with a little bit

00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:26,600
about our own backgrounds and how we got

00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:29,400
involved in Drupal in the first place

00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:31,229
we'll share some of our own personal

00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:35,100
ideas of how to help the Drupal

00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:36,810
community can continue to grow and then

00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:39,600
we'll wrap up with a set of hopefully

00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:44,159
easy to remember guidelines for your own

00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:47,340
efforts so I'll start with a little bit

00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:49,259
about me I've been in tech for a long

00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:53,250
time and worked in a lot of different

00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:55,890
areas kind of a Jill of all trades I can

00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:58,229
put together a plausible sounding career

00:01:55,890 --> 00:02:00,000
path and if there's any you Xers in the

00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:01,799
room they'll know that humans are really

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,100
good at rationalizing their actions

00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:09,239
after the fact but in fact I was never a

00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:12,180
Stacey and Stacey was a girl in my fifth

00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:13,890
grade class and I don't know why I

00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:15,420
remember this but when

00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:18,330
asked us what we wanted to be when we

00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:20,880
grew up Stacy said pediatric

00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:24,090
anesthesiologist and I was just like

00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:26,010
what not only did she know you know not

00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:28,980
just a doctor but she knew exactly what

00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:31,410
kind and I doubt that very many of us

00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:33,000
are Stacey's but we're kind of

00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:34,440
encouraged to be they kind of make it

00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,760
sound like if you you've got to have a

00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:39,000
path and you got to know where you're

00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:40,590
going you might have seen this quote

00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,970
from Lewis Carroll about you know if you

00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:43,890
don't know where you're going any road

00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:46,920
will take you there and a lot of the

00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:48,510
times when I see that it always seems to

00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:50,940
have kind of a negative connotation that

00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:53,910
you know oh well any old road will do

00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:56,100
but if you don't need to take a specific

00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:58,260
road just think of all the interesting

00:02:56,100 --> 00:03:02,190
ones you can go down look at and that's

00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:04,110
kind of what I did with my career I was

00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:05,910
kind of all over the place I came from

00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:07,890
an engineering background I worked for

00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:09,930
really big companies I worked for some

00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:12,209
smaller companies government contractors

00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:18,329
did some teaching I did all kinds of

00:03:12,209 --> 00:03:21,540
stuff but you know some roads don't

00:03:18,329 --> 00:03:23,519
always turn out so great so eventually I

00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:26,850
found myself becoming more and more

00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:28,530
stressed and anxious it tipped over into

00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:30,840
depression and I was practically a

00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:33,299
walking what not to do according to

00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:36,360
Sheryl Sandberg and the lean in movement

00:03:33,299 --> 00:03:38,160
I cut back hours and levels of

00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,920
responsibility at work due to family

00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:41,340
needs and I was still burning out

00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,799
eventually

00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:47,940
there was a reorg my job was cut and

00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:50,250
boom now what I started interviewing and

00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:53,190
discovered that what I already knew was

00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:56,670
no longer enough was a little stale

00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:58,560
I needed to re-skill and worse as I was

00:03:56,670 --> 00:04:01,019
interviewing I was being told things

00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:04,980
that fed every single one of my own self

00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:08,489
doubts the quote up there was one that I

00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:10,799
had that just it was really terrible I

00:04:08,489 --> 00:04:12,510
bombed that interview and at the end of

00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:14,820
it the person interviewing me said well

00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:16,229
I think we'd both agree they while you

00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:19,350
were doing development you weren't real

00:04:16,229 --> 00:04:21,090
really a developer okay no I didn't

00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:23,789
agree with that but I didn't know what

00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:26,640
to do with that and I was really kind of

00:04:23,789 --> 00:04:27,000
lost so I spent a long time thinking you

00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,650
know

00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,870
I seriously thought about dropping out

00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:32,580
of the tech world didn't really seem

00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:36,900
like I had a place and I didn't really

00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:39,000
know how to find one I did decide

00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:40,080
eventually I wanted to be here so what

00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,350
do I do

00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:46,080
I the key for me was personal

00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:48,210
connections I had a former coworker who

00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:50,760
told me about some email listserv thing

00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:53,520
and I signed up and somewhere on there

00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:56,130
it led me to information about women who

00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:59,280
code in Washington DC which is where I'm

00:04:56,130 --> 00:05:01,500
from and that connected me with this

00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:04,230
super active super supportive online

00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:05,760
community and the more was around them I

00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:07,910
would find out about other opportunities

00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:10,500
and places I could learn things

00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:12,450
eventually I heard about this debug

00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,500
Academy program and I thought you know

00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:16,380
there's a lot about that that sounds

00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:18,419
good for me but I don't know this I've

00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:20,640
never heard of this before well I had a

00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:22,080
personal connection in that group who

00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:23,700
told me about it and she could vouch for

00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,620
it she'd actually taken the training

00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:28,590
herself she knew it was a quality

00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:29,940
program so after I got in touch with her

00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:31,740
I said well okay let me find this out

00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:33,570
for myself so that's how I ended up

00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:36,419
getting involved taking some classes

00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:39,570
with debug Academy and getting into the

00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:43,560
Drupal community shortly after finishing

00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:47,070
my classes I got hired by a company in

00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:48,479
the DC area doing Drupal work and after

00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:51,450
a while I even had the opportunity then

00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:55,229
to come back to debug Academy where I am

00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:57,330
now to help others learn so yeah things

00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:59,100
worked out eventually for me but when I

00:05:57,330 --> 00:06:01,350
think about how I got started and what

00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:03,300
would have made it easier the biggest

00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:06,870
things that helped or that I wish to had

00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:08,490
were supportive communities to point

00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:11,040
point me in the right direction though

00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:15,300
that was one I actually think exists

00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:19,350
already the question or the challenge is

00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:22,050
really more making sure you can find it

00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:25,110
clear on-ramps can I tell where to start

00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:27,030
like okay I'm interested in this where

00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:28,950
where do I go how do I get started who

00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:30,900
do I connect with I feel like there's a

00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:33,479
lot of that that's happening and the

00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:37,260
more I can get involved with that I'm

00:06:33,479 --> 00:06:37,680
gonna want to definitely do that this

00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:39,530
one

00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,330
Drupal Welcome Wagon

00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:43,280
I think there may actually be some

00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:45,320
programs in in process for that and I'm

00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,730
kind of looking for it but it was sort

00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:48,560
of like if you're completely new and

00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:50,930
you're looking for a way to get involved

00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,430
just people who reach out to you and say

00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:53,960
hey you know here's some stuff that you

00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:55,880
might want to know here's some let me

00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:59,890
show you where things are that would

00:06:55,880 --> 00:07:02,120
have been super helpful and the emphasis

00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:04,760
continued integration on like different

00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:07,310
types of people doing Drupal not just

00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:08,180
developers not just content people I

00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:10,790
mean that's one of the things that I

00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:12,470
think is nice about this year is Drupal

00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:14,240
con is the fact that there are multiple

00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:16,310
groups there I'd like to see them get

00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:20,960
even more connected together and have

00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:23,240
even less separation all right so I'm

00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:25,100
gonna turn it over to Jack now it's a

00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:26,690
little bit abrupt but I want to keep

00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:28,660
things moving along so those are sort of

00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:35,390
my own personal things from my

00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:37,400
experience so my name is Jack Garrett

00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:40,850
I'm a Drupal developer at the bug

00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:43,220
Academy but for most of my vocational

00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:46,790
life I've been doing the humanities I've

00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:48,530
been studying history really for 12

00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:50,450
years four of that and undergrad and

00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:53,210
eight in graduate school getting my

00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:55,130
doctorate going to Germany studying

00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:57,590
German colonialism in Africa and the

00:07:55,130 --> 00:08:00,020
slave trade so this is a very weird

00:07:57,590 --> 00:08:02,060
experience for me making this career

00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:05,000
transition and suddenly talking at

00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:09,700
Drupal con so this is once again a

00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:13,010
little surreal but what happened is in

00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:15,430
2017 I eventually finished my graduate

00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:18,919
school and had to enter the workforce

00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:21,320
and essentially I kind of had to take a

00:08:18,919 --> 00:08:24,080
look in the mirror and decide whether I

00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:26,960
wanted to be a journeyman across the

00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:29,330
United States being an adjunct and

00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:32,780
trying to get a tenure-track position

00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:37,700
which is increasingly elusive perhaps

00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:41,330
unicorn like and I taught at private

00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:44,089
schools for a year and last February so

00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:46,400
I guess 14 or so months ago I started

00:08:44,089 --> 00:08:51,260
doing web development I just wondered

00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:52,190
HTML CSS JavaScript and totally by

00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:54,470
accident I

00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:56,540
found ruble it was like what is this

00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:59,660
this is a content management system and

00:08:56,540 --> 00:09:02,480
as I finally started digging into it a

00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:05,120
little bit I realized I could leverage

00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:07,100
all of those previous skills and put it

00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,930
in a nice little complete package and

00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:11,390
make some really interesting websites

00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:14,210
with some of these entry-level skills

00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:18,440
that I had built up for the past four

00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:19,010
months since then I built some nonprofit

00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:21,920
sites

00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:23,990
worked on Drupal TV and then even some

00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:25,580
federal government websites which this

00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:27,920
is kind of like for me is like

00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:33,290
mind-blowing how quickly this change has

00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:35,510
occurred in a very good way so the

00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:38,000
question that I am currently struggling

00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:41,870
with is okay I made this career

00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:44,150
transition like now what do I suddenly

00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:46,610
just drop my identity as a historian

00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:50,060
something that I've been working towards

00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:52,310
for a lot for a lot of my life and of

00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:54,110
course no you just don't like drop your

00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:56,570
research and all of these ideas that you

00:09:54,110 --> 00:10:02,540
have but you want to incorporate it in

00:09:56,570 --> 00:10:05,960
this new career path and so for me I

00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:07,790
guess these two bullet points is the

00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:09,920
second one is what most people think

00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:12,860
about is okay I know how to build

00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:16,280
websites do I want to go into module

00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:17,870
development or theming however I kind of

00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:21,350
wanted to take a step back and think

00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:23,300
about how I could reach out to some of

00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:26,600
the previous communities that I

00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:29,270
inhabited and think about making new

00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:32,300
kinds of websites new products or taking

00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:34,730
their ideas and using what I'm learning

00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:37,160
to create a collaboration something that

00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:39,260
would make me grow as a web developer

00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:41,930
not even necessarily learning new skills

00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:47,510
but taking those ideas their research

00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:49,850
and putting something together so this

00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:52,130
is this is the interesting part how do

00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:55,190
you get cantankerous historians

00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:58,460
interested in Drupal yes there are

00:10:55,190 --> 00:11:00,830
digital history programs but for me how

00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:02,870
I was thinking about it is getting

00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:05,390
individuals who are just leaving PhD

00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:05,930
programs people who want to get their

00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:10,130
research

00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:12,560
read and get them on a digital platform

00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:16,279
yes they might be published in academic

00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:19,070
journals or monographs but they want

00:11:16,279 --> 00:11:23,240
something else and so I had to translate

00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:25,490
some of those Drupal isms into their

00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:28,190
kind of jargon kind of speak in their

00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:30,200
terms which for me was actually kind of

00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:33,170
fun thinking about how do you take a

00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:37,550
dissertation and make it like a Drupal

00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:39,740
product so for me at the end of the day

00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:42,920
when I'm talking to historians it's

00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:46,339
really about content types and that

00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:49,190
seems very kind of basic or simple but

00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:52,490
historians think about primary documents

00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:55,580
and Drupal wants to give the information

00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:58,310
meaning historians look at documentation

00:11:55,580 --> 00:12:01,040
and they have to interpret the past and

00:11:58,310 --> 00:12:04,250
give it meaning like these are these are

00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:06,230
things like their ears pure peak up when

00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:08,120
I say these things so this is like

00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:11,089
alright this is this seems like a

00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:13,850
promising path so it's really just

00:12:11,089 --> 00:12:15,950
explaining really how Triple thinks and

00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:17,450
connects to what they're doing I mean

00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:20,089
that's not really all that surprising

00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:27,290
but in practice I think that can be

00:12:20,089 --> 00:12:30,470
challenging so just a separate slide

00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:32,690
here so talking about historians in

00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:35,270
Drupal and there's already an existing

00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:37,700
conversation happening called digital

00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:40,400
history this isn't just like history of

00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:42,800
digital media but an actual discipline

00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:46,070
that uses digital methods to convey the

00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:47,810
past and so for me this was all right I

00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:50,390
want to engage into an existing

00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:52,880
conversation into this community that I

00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:56,000
you know had its kind of since left

00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:58,220
behind in some ways there are a few

00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,370
different ways of doing digital history

00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:03,890
you can kind of read that up there but

00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:07,310
the second one to me is most interesting

00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:10,610
is how do you make academic research

00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:12,890
accessible to everyone not only just for

00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:15,290
kind of historians to get their research

00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:17,209
out there but for people laypeople who

00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:19,339
aren't necessarily reading the

00:13:17,209 --> 00:13:21,439
cutting-edge history research

00:13:19,339 --> 00:13:24,230
you want them to be able to access this

00:13:21,439 --> 00:13:26,420
or as a history teacher how do you get

00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:28,970
high schoolers to be engaged in the past

00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:31,519
in in varying ways so I had to think

00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:36,889
about a little bit what those Drupal

00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:39,199
offer out of the box and so this is the

00:13:36,889 --> 00:13:41,660
the getting historians interested in

00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:43,430
Drupal so I've already mentioned the

00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:46,300
content types which for me is the

00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:48,620
beating heart of Drupal but then also

00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:51,529
organizing data and giving it meaning

00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:54,050
and then displaying it dynamically

00:13:51,529 --> 00:13:56,180
whether you're using views or kind of

00:13:54,050 --> 00:14:00,999
locations on maps with custom map

00:13:56,180 --> 00:14:04,009
markers I think for Humanities

00:14:00,999 --> 00:14:06,410
professors or people engaging in read

00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:10,100
and meaningful research there's a lot to

00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:15,439
offer out of the box here in Drupal that

00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:18,290
isn't necessarily a big customized

00:14:15,439 --> 00:14:21,410
project but something that speaks to one

00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:24,680
niche of like an oral history program in

00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:31,279
making that accessible and used in

00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:33,350
Drupal so to kind of come back is a

00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:36,620
point of this part of the presentation

00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:39,050
for me was to really think about what

00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:41,959
were the communities that I am or was a

00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:44,959
part of and engaging in some interesting

00:14:41,959 --> 00:14:47,360
conversations with them how what what

00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:48,189
does Drupal offer them and then

00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:51,139
conversely

00:14:48,189 --> 00:14:54,620
what are the projects that I can grow as

00:14:51,139 --> 00:14:56,269
a web developer using their ideas so not

00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:59,569
necessarily learning a new technology

00:14:56,269 --> 00:15:03,230
but then bringing something new for me

00:14:59,569 --> 00:15:05,240
to work with so it's not yeah like this

00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:06,079
new hot technology like react or

00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:09,889
something like that

00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:12,740
but oh this cool archive they they found

00:15:09,889 --> 00:15:16,100
so I wanted to like display that data so

00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:18,639
I'll leave it at that and pass it on to

00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:18,639
Ashraf

00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:30,020
thank you very much hello my name is

00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:33,150
Ashraf

00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:37,020
Ashraf I'll pronounce it properly

00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:40,080
I I'm the founder of debug Academy my

00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:43,260
journey to Drupal was a little funny I

00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:45,780
think they all are somewhat but before

00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:47,910
Drupal I I thought myself web

00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:49,830
development you know 30 at the age of 13

00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:52,380
I was you know and I in a good place

00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:55,190
lucky to have access to the right

00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:58,020
technology and build some websites

00:15:55,190 --> 00:16:01,290
eventually went to college not at 13 but

00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:04,110
I went to college and I really disliked

00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:06,510
it I hated being assigned homework that

00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:07,860
was going to get thrown away at the end

00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:09,780
of the day that that's just how I looked

00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:14,270
at it and it felt like such a big time

00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:15,960
investment for you know like I said

00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:19,200
assignments that just didn't feel

00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:21,780
practical eventually like I said I

00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:23,760
dropped out I reenroll died I felt the

00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:25,830
pressure from society I had to finish

00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:27,720
the degree re-enrolled and I got my

00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:28,230
degree in electrical engineering which

00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,540
was great

00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:33,320
but I felt like I didn't know how to do

00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:35,820
electra chol engineering you know so I

00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:39,000
ended up going back to software getting

00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:41,490
a job in software and throughout that

00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:44,790
through that job I was waiting for a

00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:46,500
clearance and basically my manager came

00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:49,020
and said hey we started your clearance

00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:51,210
process it's hard for people from you

00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:52,710
know Arab backgrounds it's gonna take

00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:54,930
two years for you we can't wait that

00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:56,640
long so we're gonna put you on unpaid

00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:59,760
leave if you could find another project

00:16:56,640 --> 00:17:00,960
in the company will you know start

00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:04,890
paying you again and you can go to that

00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:07,470
project so in that time I was fortunate

00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:09,300
to be called by a recruiter random

00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:11,670
LinkedIn recruiter and they basically

00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:14,100
said hey have you heard of Drupal

00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:16,560
I knew they were recruiter I was like

00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:19,140
why do you want to know so they

00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:21,180
basically said there was an interview in

00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:23,670
three weeks and they wanted to know if I

00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:25,709
wanted to participate I had not heard of

00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:28,050
Drupal but three weeks was plenty of

00:17:25,709 --> 00:17:30,650
time while not working so I picked up

00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:33,170
the pro Drupal 7 development book

00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:35,840
and I pretty much read it cover-to-cover

00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:40,580
three weeks later I was able to land

00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:42,080
that job so I was able to learn Drupal

00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:46,040
of course it helped I had a background

00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:47,840
in web development but I didn't know why

00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:49,670
we use Drupal you know I read this book

00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:51,980
which was all about this is how you make

00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:55,430
custom modules this is these are content

00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:57,170
types etc I was like why would I get

00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:58,580
this whole framework just to make it

00:17:57,170 --> 00:18:02,450
more difficult for me to write custom

00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:04,070
code I wasn't aware essentially of the

00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:05,930
contribs base I wasn't aware of the

00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:10,760
community the book didn't talk about the

00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:12,140
community so I really just knew that you

00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:13,550
know people were willing to hire for

00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:17,360
Drupal developers and they had a hard

00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:19,370
time finding them so I ended up getting

00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:21,260
deeper into the Drupal rabbit hole I

00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:24,080
ended up getting a job at aqua after a

00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:25,880
couple of years and that's when I

00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:28,820
started to realize oh there's there's

00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:30,590
more to this software so I learned more

00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:32,660
about drupal.org I learned about the

00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:34,640
community I got all of those

00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:37,520
certifications Grand Master

00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:39,910
certifications at Acquia I got to work

00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:42,890
on some really cool enterprise websites

00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:44,420
and I learned essentially the proper way

00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:45,950
to build a Drupal site and I felt really

00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:48,500
bad for the clients I had worked for

00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:53,870
before I really wanted to go back and

00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:55,550
rebuild their sites but thinking about

00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:57,800
all of that you know the fact that that

00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:59,540
company hired me it's not necessarily

00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:01,010
that I tricked them they knew I had a

00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:02,570
web development background they knew I

00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:05,480
was willing to learn and they had no

00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:07,700
other Drupal developers to pick from so

00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:10,520
I kind of realized you know if I was

00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:12,650
able to land a job in Drupal just after

00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:14,660
a couple of weeks of studying I have a

00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:16,640
lot of friends and family who also you

00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:20,240
know don't like their jobs or in a bad

00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:22,910
situation if companies are so desperate

00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:24,440
to hire Drupal developers can we you

00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:27,020
know enable more of these people who are

00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:31,550
in a bad spot to get into the industry

00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:33,380
so I essentially tested it out I posted

00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:35,510
on Facebook and said hey I'm teaching

00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:37,070
this programming language anyone want to

00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:39,110
be a programmer you can just come take

00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:41,450
it for free and it was for three months

00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:43,279
part time in my house

00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:45,200
a lot of funny stories out of that

00:19:43,279 --> 00:19:46,909
dynamic because it wasn't people I was

00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:50,630
necessarily close to or people I knew

00:19:46,909 --> 00:19:52,760
very well but it worked out you know we

00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:54,470
had people who started careers as Drupal

00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:57,380
developers people who had not had

00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:59,200
programming jobs before and you know to

00:19:57,380 --> 00:20:02,990
this day it's it's really cool seeing

00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:05,149
how how things have changed for them so

00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:08,559
I moved on you know I pushed forward

00:20:05,149 --> 00:20:11,360
with the idea created debug Academy and

00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:12,950
you know put a lot of time into

00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:16,010
essentially creating jargon free

00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:18,289
education teachers I tried to combat all

00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:20,720
the things I didn't like from college we

00:20:18,289 --> 00:20:24,080
do real projects it's not a repeat

00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:27,260
project and it's very welcoming and

00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:28,669
inclusive we're not just selling Drupal

00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:30,230
for the sake of selling it you have to

00:20:28,669 --> 00:20:33,909
talk to people and see what their

00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:36,559
backgrounds are and how it applies and

00:20:33,909 --> 00:20:39,620
I've been fortunate it's been just

00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:41,539
naturally diverse it might be that you

00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:43,429
know some of the community family

00:20:41,539 --> 00:20:46,250
friends I've had how you know fall under

00:20:43,429 --> 00:20:49,039
the diverse category for tech you know

00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:52,480
in the current semester we had 40% of

00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:55,100
the class being women who enrolled I do

00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:58,010
work to reach out but at the same time

00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:59,809
I'm not doing anything ridiculous it's

00:20:58,010 --> 00:21:01,549
just a matter of making it a welcoming

00:20:59,809 --> 00:21:04,940
environment and sometimes convincing

00:21:01,549 --> 00:21:09,019
people that the doubts they have while

00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:11,899
it may be based in legitimate things are

00:21:09,019 --> 00:21:13,059
not as significant as they might think

00:21:11,899 --> 00:21:15,350
they are

00:21:13,059 --> 00:21:17,840
you have to fight their impostor

00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:21,440
syndrome with them so our ongoing

00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:25,039
efforts to essentially help in this

00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:26,840
department as a company so now I left

00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:29,510
dock we have been doing deep running

00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:32,539
debug Academy for about two years there

00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:33,529
a handful of things I try to live by and

00:21:32,539 --> 00:21:36,830
and these are things that other

00:21:33,529 --> 00:21:39,289
companies can do I try to hire people

00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:41,779
for their first Drupal job when possible

00:21:39,289 --> 00:21:44,899
so if I'm if I need a developer for

00:21:41,779 --> 00:21:46,909
something I might know this person was

00:21:44,899 --> 00:21:48,620
really amazing but they have a job

00:21:46,909 --> 00:21:50,659
somewhere I'll try not to hire that

00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:53,240
person I'll try to hire someone who

00:21:50,659 --> 00:21:55,190
maybe had potential maybe they're in a

00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:57,050
job they really don't like

00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:59,360
and you know maybe a minimum-wage job

00:21:57,050 --> 00:22:01,700
maybe I could swap out that income and

00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:05,780
hire them for this and give them some

00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:08,810
time to learn also reputation is a

00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:10,430
really big thing I'm I'm fine right now

00:22:08,810 --> 00:22:13,790
but there are many people who take the

00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:15,500
class who you know their name is not out

00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:18,050
there at all so whenever I see an

00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:20,150
opportunity to patch I just to submit a

00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:22,640
patch to Drupal I reach out to alumni

00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:24,500
and I say you know hey you worked hard

00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:26,360
and you don't have a job yet let's get

00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:28,310
you to submit this patch or if there's a

00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:29,780
speaking opportunity last year at Drupal

00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:33,920
con I was able to invite one of the

00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:35,780
alumni to speak with me and essentially

00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:37,700
the idea is the whole concept of

00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:42,590
extending your privilege I'm privileged

00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:45,170
in many ways and I've I see firsthand

00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:47,780
that many alumni from the you know from

00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:49,670
our courses will go to a job interview

00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:51,170
and based on how they look the

00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:53,660
interviewer will come talk to me and say

00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:55,730
hey you know that guy he seemed a little

00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:58,100
you know a little shady and I'm like no

00:22:55,730 --> 00:23:00,470
he was you know he was quiet well black

00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:03,500
that's that's not Shady you know it's

00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:05,870
your biases and it's it's like I'll tell

00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:08,270
them like you are being unreasonable I

00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:09,590
was there I know this person and I'll

00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:11,450
push back and I'll make them

00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:12,440
uncomfortable because other people can't

00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:16,430
do that for themselves necessarily

00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:19,130
without losing the opportunity so if

00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:21,920
you're in a position to to do that to

00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:23,500
extend the privilege it can have a huge

00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:25,220
effect I've had people come and tell me

00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:26,930
you know we've been holding off on

00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:28,820
having kids because we couldn't afford

00:23:26,930 --> 00:23:31,520
it but now you know you helped me get

00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:33,560
that job and like now they have two kids

00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:36,590
and it's something they didn't foresee

00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:39,020
happening I've had people tell me you

00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:40,880
know we've had so much back pain because

00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:42,770
I had so much back in because we used to

00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:44,900
move you know lift things heavy

00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:47,570
machinery all the time and now I'm just

00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:50,240
building websites a booze Allen it's

00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:54,500
it's it's pretty significant there's not

00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:56,750
this artificial you know community to to

00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:59,000
help with its really individual people

00:23:56,750 --> 00:24:03,320
you can focus on see how you can work

00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:05,240
with them one on one and you can really

00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:05,520
make a big difference for them and for

00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:07,860
you

00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:12,570
you of course gained a friend you you

00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:13,880
network and it always pays itself back

00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:16,290
towards the beginning I was thinking

00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:18,300
whatever worst case scenario I start

00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:20,190
debug Academy for a year it doesn't work

00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:22,460
out financially I go back and get a job

00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:26,040
I get to say I had a company for a year

00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:28,140
you know not a big deal but I found that

00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:30,510
accepting people who can't afford it for

00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:32,850
free or telling them wait till you get a

00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:35,429
job you can pay me back doing things

00:24:32,850 --> 00:24:37,500
like that have over time actually paid

00:24:35,429 --> 00:24:39,600
themselves back because people will come

00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:41,040
back and say hey you know I got that

00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,870
first job thank you I'm looking to

00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:44,910
switch now I can refer them to a partner

00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:46,920
company get a referral or they'll go to

00:24:44,910 --> 00:24:49,530
a company and other people in that

00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:52,260
company maybe like a secretary will be

00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:54,210
there and say hey why do you get to work

00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:55,620
as a developer and I'm a secretary and

00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:57,690
they'll tell them well I took this class

00:24:55,620 --> 00:25:01,620
you know so these things tend to pay

00:24:57,690 --> 00:25:04,530
themselves back if you know just helping

00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:06,330
somebody was not enough that that you

00:25:04,530 --> 00:25:09,300
know there are other things good things

00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:12,420
that come out of it in terms of looking

00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:14,040
forward recommendations it would have

00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:15,900
helped me a lot if the community were

00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:17,940
discoverable maybe even through Drupal

00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:21,270
itself through the admin interface you

00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:22,860
just say like hey new to Drupal don't

00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:25,260
know the community it's a big part of

00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:28,710
this so right on the admin status page

00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:30,300
report status etc you can have something

00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:32,070
they are pointing them to the community

00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:34,650
may be pointing them to a YouTube clip

00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:38,850
that's just like here get to know Drupal

00:25:34,650 --> 00:25:40,350
it's more than code in each of our

00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:44,420
companies you know wherever you work

00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:47,160
look to hire and train beginners they

00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:48,929
they can bring a lot and when I say

00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:51,929
beginners it's not necessarily young

00:25:48,929 --> 00:25:54,960
people it's beginners to Drupal so just

00:25:51,929 --> 00:26:00,030
look to bring people in with different

00:25:54,960 --> 00:26:02,910
backgrounds than your own and we were

00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:04,860
able to bring Drupal TV to the community

00:26:02,910 --> 00:26:07,880
Drupal TV it's this free resource

00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:11,390
embraced by the Drupal Association which

00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:13,410
allows which which is a central

00:26:11,390 --> 00:26:14,790
centralized location for all of the

00:26:13,410 --> 00:26:17,869
conference videos so you'll find this

00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:20,330
one and Conference videos from

00:26:17,869 --> 00:26:23,779
pretty much all of the Drupal events we

00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:25,969
know about you you'll be able to

00:26:23,779 --> 00:26:27,349
discover those for free for going

00:26:25,969 --> 00:26:29,599
forward I'm hoping that we can make

00:26:27,349 --> 00:26:31,639
events easy to discover on that platform

00:26:29,599 --> 00:26:33,889
as well because I personally don't know

00:26:31,639 --> 00:26:35,450
when events are going to you know when

00:26:33,889 --> 00:26:37,789
the session submissions start when they

00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:39,889
close when what's coming up where it is

00:26:37,789 --> 00:26:42,739
etc so centralizing some of that

00:26:39,889 --> 00:26:45,200
information potentially including way to

00:26:42,739 --> 00:26:48,919
access it through Drupal itself I think

00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:51,169
those would all all really help and you

00:26:48,919 --> 00:26:52,309
know as as a person running a company

00:26:51,169 --> 00:26:54,409
you know I've been fortunate to hire

00:26:52,309 --> 00:26:58,159
Lisa and Jack and have them join the

00:26:54,409 --> 00:26:59,690
team and I I'm in a I get to cheat I get

00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:01,029
to work with them in class and then see

00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:05,389
how great they are and then hire them

00:27:01,029 --> 00:27:07,159
but but really it's it's spectacular

00:27:05,389 --> 00:27:09,589
like the different backgrounds what what

00:27:07,159 --> 00:27:11,059
every person contributes I'd say I'm

00:27:09,589 --> 00:27:13,099
very different from both of them in

00:27:11,059 --> 00:27:16,249
terms of my background and style and

00:27:13,099 --> 00:27:20,059
personality and I love that in hiring

00:27:16,249 --> 00:27:22,009
them we we now work as a team where we

00:27:20,059 --> 00:27:24,049
each bring something very different but

00:27:22,009 --> 00:27:25,700
very complimentary to the table and I

00:27:24,049 --> 00:27:28,549
think the Drupal community can benefit

00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:34,519
from that on a wider scale if we expand

00:27:28,549 --> 00:27:36,229
these principles we all have really

00:27:34,519 --> 00:27:37,759
different backgrounds and really

00:27:36,229 --> 00:27:39,049
different approaches and it was really

00:27:37,759 --> 00:27:40,759
hard to figure out how to sort of pull

00:27:39,049 --> 00:27:44,749
this all together to summarize at the

00:27:40,759 --> 00:27:46,719
end of our presentation so it seemed

00:27:44,749 --> 00:27:49,629
like a good way to do it was sort of to

00:27:46,719 --> 00:27:52,669
go really high level and say okay so

00:27:49,629 --> 00:27:54,200
here's some ideas that we had you know

00:27:52,669 --> 00:27:57,139
and we've told you about them as things

00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:59,299
that would help bring more people into

00:27:57,139 --> 00:28:01,249
the community and if you were thinking

00:27:59,299 --> 00:28:02,599
of doing the same things it might be

00:28:01,249 --> 00:28:05,330
easiest to think of it there's like

00:28:02,599 --> 00:28:06,950
three different really high level ways

00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:10,549
that you could structure your thinking

00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:13,879
so I'm just gonna go with these three

00:28:10,549 --> 00:28:15,529
right here make a space I've got the

00:28:13,879 --> 00:28:17,599
little pac-man guy there you may have

00:28:15,529 --> 00:28:19,820
heard this sometimes this is used for

00:28:17,599 --> 00:28:21,889
like physical examples like if you're in

00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:23,539
a group of people networking and you're

00:28:21,889 --> 00:28:25,609
all standing in a circle and there's no

00:28:23,539 --> 00:28:28,129
way for a new person to come in and join

00:28:25,609 --> 00:28:28,940
your circle the the pack the picture of

00:28:28,129 --> 00:28:30,980
the pac-man

00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:33,230
a little there's a wedge missing there's

00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:35,360
a clear space where you can go in and

00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:36,980
you can get connected so if you're

00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:39,380
trying to think of how can I help new

00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:41,630
people join in we'll look around and see

00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:43,130
is there a space can I help make a space

00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:45,590
and that could be anything from you know

00:28:43,130 --> 00:28:49,190
adding links on the admin UI to say hey

00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:53,630
the community is over here you can come

00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:57,170
this is how you can get into it just at

00:28:53,630 --> 00:29:00,290
a real high level there okay so now

00:28:57,170 --> 00:29:03,020
you've got a space here's a space it's a

00:29:00,290 --> 00:29:05,150
little scary not everybody really is

00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:07,460
gonna want to go into that space so just

00:29:05,150 --> 00:29:09,920
because you have a space it's not if you

00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:14,030
build it they will come right so think

00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:17,120
about what in your space might make

00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:18,590
people reluctant to go into it and is

00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:20,540
there something that you can do about

00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:22,580
that or like oh oh this is actually a

00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:24,500
thing that I can change let me go ahead

00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:29,030
and address this so that more people

00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:30,530
might feel willing and willing it's not

00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:34,790
quite the right word but they might be

00:29:30,530 --> 00:29:37,220
interested in joining in and the last

00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:39,410
thing I'm gonna say is offer guidance or

00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:42,710
maybe maybe better to say make guidance

00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:44,750
available some people just need a map

00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:47,420
like I kind of know what I want to do

00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:50,480
I'm here in the space I'm ok with it I

00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:51,950
want to go over there and just help me

00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:53,570
figure out how to go there so just hand

00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:55,850
me a map I'm good I'll go off and do my

00:29:53,570 --> 00:29:58,850
own thing other people will do better

00:29:55,850 --> 00:30:00,170
with a more guided approach and have

00:29:58,850 --> 00:30:02,390
someone actually helping them you know

00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:05,450
mentoring or something like that let me

00:30:02,390 --> 00:30:06,950
help you move along the line and a lot

00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:08,210
of the things we've talked about you

00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:11,300
could see that they fall into these

00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:14,420
different groups so our categories I

00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:16,850
guess so making a space making it not

00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:18,860
scary and then making guidance available

00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:21,440
to the people who are looking for it

00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:23,570
that's that's the best way that I can

00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:25,390
think of to sort of summarize the

00:30:23,570 --> 00:30:29,270
approaches that we've talked about here

00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:32,690
and I'm only 38 seconds over time check

00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:34,430
that out so we're gonna wrap up and

00:30:32,690 --> 00:30:37,850
thank you very much for coming and

00:30:34,430 --> 00:30:40,460

00:30:43,970 --> 00:30:49,730
there's mentored contribution and

00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:52,180
first-time contributor workshops and of
