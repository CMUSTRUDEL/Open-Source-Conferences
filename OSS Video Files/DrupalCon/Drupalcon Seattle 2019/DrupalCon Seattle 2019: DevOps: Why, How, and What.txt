Title: DrupalCon Seattle 2019: DevOps: Why, How, and What
Publication date: 2019-04-12
Playlist: Drupalcon Seattle 2019
Description: 
	A portion of the talk will be dynamically driven by results from this 2019 Drupal Community DevOps survey. If you are on a team that builds Drupal sites, and you haven’t responded to this survey yet, please respond to its DevOps statements, on behalf of your team, to see the results, with areas of focus and some advice. 

Many people today find themselves learning about DevOps by first seeing one of its outcomes and learning about how that outcome came to be. Learning why something is considered to be a part of DevOps is not necessary to implement those pieces of it. However, knowing why something would be considered a part of DevOps, or even why a DevOps strategy is important, and for who, can mean the difference between following and leading in an industry.

In this talk, Rob Bayliss and Kelly Albrecht will show, using intuition backed by empirical research, why DevOps is the most important technological strategy of our day. In doing so, attendees will gain the understanding necessary to gain buy-in for DevOps at their organization as well as how to know what might fit a DevOps strategy and what doesn't.

***Continue the conversation at 4:45pm in the follow up BOF: DevOps: Getting Started***

Overall, attendees of this session will leave with a foundational knowledge of DevOps that is sufficient to find their way to continued success in the field.
