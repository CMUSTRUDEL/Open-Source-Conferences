	There’s nothing worse than feeling stuck. You know how it goes: just when you’ve been tasked with creating compelling and innovative content, creativity seems to allude you. Don’t worry, there’s a way to get your creative mojo back.

Refresh the creative spirit within you by learning how other creatives — specifically songwriters, bands, and producers — work together to balance storytelling, audience engagement, language, and cadence. Understanding how they iterate, refine, and break through their own creative blocks will arm you with techniques to electrify your own approach to developing content.

At the end of this session, you will be able to:
