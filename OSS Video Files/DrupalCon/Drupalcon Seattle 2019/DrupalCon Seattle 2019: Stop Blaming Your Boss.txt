Title: DrupalCon Seattle 2019: Stop Blaming Your Boss
Publication date: 2019-04-12
Playlist: Drupalcon Seattle 2019
Description: 
	Look, it’s easy to say “my organization doesn’t do X” where X is automated testing, continuous integration, local development, version control, or any other myriad of modern development standards (that you really should be doing). In fact, if your organization isn’t doing some/all of these things, that DOES make it really hard for you to do them. But that doesn’t mean you can’t (or shouldn’t)!

This talk is all about becoming a technical leader in an organization that, perhaps, doesn’t understand why they need technical leadership. Maybe that organization is a government entity or it's a small business. Maybe it's a large corporation that hasn't used Drupal before. Regardless of the situation, if you are using Drupal, you have the opportunity to begin this journey.

Topics covered:

How can you institute change in a goliath that isn’t looking for it? 
How can you turn a single project into a collection of reusable code and technologies? 
How can you make an impact when you don’t control funding or hiring? 
How do you get buy in from key stakeholders?
How do you build influence with people you don’t control?
What sorts of alliances do you need to build within your organization to be successful?
All these topics (and more) will help you go from wanting to implement X to owning X and looking forward to what’s next.

Who should attend?

This talk is primarily about behaviors and not specific technologies (but we will discuss some technology). If you are an individual that is...

looking to broaden their organizations' adoption of Drupal and Drupal related technologies
searching to grow (or create) a new capability within their organization
interested in adopting best practices 
inspired to change the way they operate
feeling trapped by the way their organization operates
...then this talk is for you!

all right everybody I am going to get

00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:05,220
started because thirty minutes is not a

00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:07,799
lot of time and I want to make sure we

00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:09,630
have some time for Q&A at the end I'm

00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:11,330
Mike Madison and today we're going to

00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:13,710
talk about how to stop blaming your boss

00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:15,150
if you don't know me I'm a manager and

00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:16,920
architect in the professional services

00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:18,630
team at Acquia that means I'm working

00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:20,730
with Drupal 8 every day doing enterprise

00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:22,529
builds I'm also one of the organizers

00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:25,080
and the technical lead for Drupal gov

00:00:22,529 --> 00:00:27,510
con and I'm one of the maintainer of

00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:28,710
aqueous building lunch tools and if

00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:31,140
you're interested in blt there's

00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:32,489
actually a buff later this afternoon so

00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:34,290
definitely check that out please

00:00:32,489 --> 00:00:36,719
if you're a user if you want to be a

00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:38,460
user please come chat with us a couple

00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,559
other just quick announcements of

00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:43,079
registration and session submission for

00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:44,850
gov con did open this week so if you're

00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:46,320
at all interested this is a free camp

00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:49,260
it's one of the biggest camps east of

00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:51,030
the Mississippi and it is free in

00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:54,210
Bethesda Maryland every summer so please

00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:56,699
check us out and they did ask us to

00:00:54,210 --> 00:01:00,600
throw this slide up about code

00:00:56,699 --> 00:01:02,789
contribution sprints on Friday so if you

00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,260
had a chance to look at the agenda for

00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:06,869
my talk here none of this should be

00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:10,080
super surprising right this is how do

00:01:06,869 --> 00:01:12,390
you take what you're doing every day and

00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:15,299
use those behaviors to try and institute

00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:17,040
change in your organization and if I had

00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:19,140
to boil all those other bullets down to

00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,759
like two high-level things it's how do

00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:23,310
you have an July's what you want to

00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:25,530
change within your organization and then

00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:27,630
how do you drive towards that change in

00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:29,939
your organization and I specifically

00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:32,130
bolded the word you on this slide

00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:35,070
because I just cannot stress enough that

00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:37,710
this talk is not about your boss it's

00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:40,110
about you so if you're here looking to

00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:41,790
blame your boss going this is this is

00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:43,740
about what you can do day in and day out

00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:48,990
to actually start making those changes

00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:52,259
in your work life so I was on a project

00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:56,250
a few years ago and I think this project

00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:58,680
actually really personifies the problem

00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:00,299
I'm getting at in this talk so I was not

00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:02,520
the architect or even the lead developer

00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:04,979
on this project I was a back end to have

00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:06,509
part of the larger team and as I was

00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:08,190
onboarding onto the team I was hearing

00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:11,099
about the roles what everybody's doing

00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:12,989
we had a QA dev this was good we're

00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:13,890
doing two-week sprints the backlog was

00:02:12,989 --> 00:02:16,319
well groomed

00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:17,940
the architect was doing code review the

00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:19,709
tester was actually testing like these

00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:22,880
are all good signs I'm like okay this is

00:02:19,709 --> 00:02:25,140
this is looking like we're going along

00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:26,850
customers even involved in doing UAT

00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:28,110
which is even better and then I you know

00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:29,220
actually start looking at the code I'm

00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:31,110
like what the hell there's no automated

00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:33,600
tests in this repository like everything

00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:36,030
else was great but there's no automated

00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,890
tests so I asked the developer I'm like

00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:40,680
okay so you're doing QA but you're not

00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:42,630
automating QA what why why aren't you

00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:44,190
doing that and that the architect said

00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:46,050
well we don't have time it's a really

00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:48,390
short project it's a really aggressive

00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:52,769
timetable we just don't have time to do

00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:54,360
tests and if you know me I I'm a pretty

00:02:52,769 --> 00:02:57,989
big advocate for at least having some

00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:59,880
level of automated test coverage and you

00:02:57,989 --> 00:03:01,890
know I had a I had a choice in this

00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:05,340
moment of how I wanted to react to that

00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:07,140
architect on that project to to raise my

00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:09,750
concern with the lack of automated

00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:11,220
testing right these are people I knew

00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:13,620
and respected these are people I had to

00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:17,030
work with beyond this project so I had

00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:19,739
to kind of take my personal reaction to

00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:22,079
what I saw as a not awesome situation

00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:24,329
and think about how I wanted to try and

00:03:22,079 --> 00:03:26,760
drive that project towards change in a

00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:29,790
way that might not implode future

00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:31,500
relationships so I had some choices

00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:32,549
right I mean like my first choice was I

00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,079
could have like gone off on the

00:03:32,549 --> 00:03:36,000
architect like what the hell man why

00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:38,760
aren't we doing automated testing we

00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,239
have to do this this is our job and and

00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:43,470
just you know not reacted very well

00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:45,510
option two I could have been much more

00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:48,690
tactful and much more polite and like

00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:51,030
swung the best practices hammer and you

00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:53,519
know just really like browbeaten him and

00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:56,459
the team until you know again either

00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:58,970
things went south or they agreed with me

00:03:56,459 --> 00:04:01,739
and you know more than a few people have

00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:03,000
you know taken that approach on projects

00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:04,230
I'm sure many of you have worked with

00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,540
people who have thrown their weight

00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:08,730
around or their experience around to get

00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:10,109
what they want and they may get what

00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:12,239
they want in the short term but

00:04:10,109 --> 00:04:14,880
longer-term that method you're always

00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:17,400
going to hit somebody bigger and louder

00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:20,400
and more forceful than you are this is

00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:23,520
this is a short-term solution at best

00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:25,820
and again they may work but you know for

00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:27,680
me what I did in this case is I

00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:28,940
some work I showed them it was possible

00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,560
and then I worked with the team to

00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:34,490
actually build consensus and that that's

00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:37,940
not sexy that's not exciting but it it

00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:40,070
does work right so in this particular

00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:42,290
scenario I actually took some time after

00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:44,030
work one day I like sat on the couch and

00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:49,280
watched a bad movie or something and I

00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:51,140
wrote some b-hat tests I used what I

00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:53,180
have learned is best practices for using

00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:55,640
b-hat with the team I actually

00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:57,620
extensively documented what I did I

00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:59,180
provided examples that were commented

00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:01,760
out in the code that they could use

00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:03,290
themselves the team I demonstrated a

00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:05,150
couple days later what I did to the team

00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:06,890
like I didn't like try to ninja a pull

00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:08,690
request in and slip in these tests

00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:11,960
without telling everybody I showed them

00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:13,370
what I did and I actually got buy-in

00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:15,350
from the rest of the team to finish out

00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:16,970
what I had done so that when they

00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:19,160
themselves started doing pull requests

00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:20,950
in working with this they were now

00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:24,290
helping to contribute to this situation

00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:26,120
and through the end of that project

00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:28,430
actually the rest of the team including

00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:29,810
the architect contributed automated

00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:32,510
testing to the project helped to

00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:34,610
maintain the test base and you know I I

00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:36,680
do genuinely believe we better had

00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:38,390
delivered a better code base to the the

00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:40,700
client at the end than we would have in

00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:43,160
the first place and I I genuinely

00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:44,840
believe that the second bullet here is a

00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:46,340
lot of the reason that this worked right

00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:49,070
I did not go back to the team and said

00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:50,360
well okay guys you now have to go do all

00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:52,070
this extra work that you didn't do

00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:56,120
initially I did some of that work

00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:58,370
personally to to allow them to see that

00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:59,870
it could be done the fact that I

00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:01,490
provided the examples and the

00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:02,540
documentation meant that even some of

00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:04,460
the folks on the team that weren't

00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:06,200
really strong in b-hat no longer had

00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:07,820
that I don't know how to be had excuse

00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:09,380
right I mean just like copy and paste

00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:11,930
this and take this I mean like there's

00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:15,440
no effort required at that point and

00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:17,180
again I got team buy-in and we as a team

00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:19,850
went back to project leadership in the

00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:21,800
client and managed up instead of waiting

00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:23,690
for the client or the architect to come

00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:26,330
back and give a mandate for something to

00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:28,340
happen so if I have to give you one

00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:29,900
takeaway from this story it's that if

00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:33,500
you want to affect change at any level

00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:35,000
right the most direct and fastest way

00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:36,290
for you to affect that change is for you

00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,980
to actually roll up your sleeves and be

00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:40,320
willing to do some work to do it

00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:41,760
and that that's not to say that if you

00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:44,550
do work a hundred percent of the time

00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:46,470
you're gonna get your way you won't but

00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:49,170
having some evidence that what you want

00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:51,210
to do is possible is a much harder thing

00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:55,080
to argue against and yeah we don't do

00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:56,820
that the other thing I want to talk

00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:59,280
about here in this case is how much time

00:06:56,820 --> 00:07:01,740
did I really spend writing b-hat tests

00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,990
and the answer is not much the reason

00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:05,880
for that is I learned a long time ago

00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:08,520
like I come from a freelance background

00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:09,600
and I learned very quickly that when

00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,980
you're working with a platform like

00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:14,880
Drupal when you're working with a

00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:16,590
platform like WordPress everything you

00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:19,860
do there's a really good chance you're

00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:21,960
gonna do it more than once so if I write

00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:23,940
a bunch of b-hat tests for some customer

00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:25,560
over here for my nodes and my

00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:27,630
permissions in my workflow and bla bla

00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:29,340
bla bla bla there's a really good chance

00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:30,510
that the customer over here that I'm

00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:33,270
working with later is gonna have

00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:35,130
different tests but tests that use a lot

00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:38,190
of the same guts and under workings and

00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:40,890
so on and so forth so every time I solve

00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:43,620
a problem I'm thinking about how can I

00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:45,030
use that problem again in the future of

00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:47,250
that solution again in the future to

00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:49,650
save me time so when I sat down in this

00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:52,110
particular instance to write b-hat tests

00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:54,660
it's not like I spent 40 hours over a

00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:56,250
month or whatever like like jury-rigging

00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:58,140
and b-hat tests I mean like I literally

00:07:56,250 --> 00:08:00,630
copied and pasted it what I consider to

00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:02,070
be best practice behat tests and changed

00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:05,910
them to work for that project it was

00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:08,040
like a movies worth of effort I also

00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:09,480
want to stress for Drupal right a lot of

00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,980
organizations aren't down with the

00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:13,380
open-source contribution thing right

00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:16,400
they should be but not every company is

00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:18,990
that's fine think smaller than that

00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:21,510
right if you're writing something that

00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:23,970
isn't appropriate to contribute back to

00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:26,220
open source that doesn't mean it's not

00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:28,590
appropriate for you to reuse it in your

00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:30,450
organization my last job we wrote a

00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:32,640
custom authentication module to do

00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:34,740
single sign-on with Kerberos it's a

00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:38,040
super specific thing to use with our

00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:39,720
Active Directory at that old job never

00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:42,030
going to contribute that like it

00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:43,950
wouldn't work off the network we used it

00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:45,840
on every single project that we did at

00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:47,160
that company once we built it once we

00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:48,540
had it working and we shared it and

00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:51,150
maintained it across all of those

00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:51,720
projects so when I say there could be a

00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:53,480
module

00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:55,709
for that keep in mind if you think

00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:58,439
bigger than what you're working on right

00:08:55,709 --> 00:09:01,620
now frequently you can reuse what you're

00:08:58,439 --> 00:09:03,360
working on architect for reuse and these

00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:04,740
could be any number of things right this

00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,199
could be what local environment are you

00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:08,910
using so if half of you are using Docs

00:09:07,199 --> 00:09:11,910
alone half of you are using Drupal VM

00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:13,139
like figure it out like maybe you're not

00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:15,060
gonna win that argument but

00:09:13,139 --> 00:09:17,279
standardizing around a local environment

00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:19,949
is gonna save your team time effort and

00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:21,329
money make sure you're deploying the

00:09:19,949 --> 00:09:22,949
same way think about how you're storing

00:09:21,329 --> 00:09:26,459
code think about continuous integration

00:09:22,949 --> 00:09:28,379
automated testing etc etc etc anything

00:09:26,459 --> 00:09:30,420
you can do to standardize and reuse an

00:09:28,379 --> 00:09:33,480
approach from project to project project

00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:36,300
is going to give you a much much

00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:37,800
stronger platform that that word gets

00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:41,279
thrown around a lot but much stronger

00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:44,310
platform to stand on to to try and adopt

00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:46,019
change and best practices so I do like

00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:47,579
to tell this story and I take no credit

00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:49,709
for this story because this all happened

00:09:47,579 --> 00:09:51,089
a talk we had before they hired me but

00:09:49,709 --> 00:09:52,350
on our professional services team we

00:09:51,089 --> 00:09:54,629
were running into this exact same

00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:56,699
problem right so as Drupal 8 was in its

00:09:54,629 --> 00:09:59,879
infancy as people were coming to acqua

00:09:56,699 --> 00:10:02,399
to hire us to do like pro level

00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:04,079
enterprise builds we had architects who

00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:05,399
were running in 19 different directions

00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:07,769
solving the same problems in different

00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:09,689
ways we were setting up our projects

00:10:07,769 --> 00:10:13,350
differently we were using different

00:10:09,689 --> 00:10:15,180
strategies for configuration you know we

00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:19,230
were solving the same problems over and

00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:21,120
over and over again differently so the

00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:23,189
professional services team Matt Grasmick

00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,800
who is at the con this week by the way

00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:27,480
so high-five him if you see him actually

00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:30,120
started working on this open source

00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:32,759
project that today will standardize your

00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:34,439
template for project creation give you a

00:10:32,759 --> 00:10:36,720
whole bunch of automation commands for

00:10:34,439 --> 00:10:41,160
deployment continuous integration VM

00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:43,189
setup etc etc and you know was blt what

00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:45,569
it was today when it first started no

00:10:43,189 --> 00:10:47,250
absolutely not it was very simple but it

00:10:45,569 --> 00:10:49,079
has grown into something much larger

00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:52,620
it's been downloaded I don't know over

00:10:49,079 --> 00:10:56,220
half a million times Minh something that

00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:59,430
has very much taken this notion of reuse

00:10:56,220 --> 00:11:02,630
recycle ideas and build upon that little

00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:04,440
by little as you get larger and larger

00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:07,410
support

00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:09,420
so my second takeaway is assume that

00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:11,850
every problem you solve you're gonna

00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:13,800
have to solve again and like how many

00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:15,509
times do you get five projects into

00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:17,339
something and go man this is exactly

00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:19,860
like this or this is exactly like that I

00:11:17,339 --> 00:11:21,389
mean it happens all the time so if you

00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:23,089
just assume when you solve a problem

00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:26,069
that you're gonna have to do it again

00:11:23,089 --> 00:11:29,879
you're hopefully saving yourself some

00:11:26,069 --> 00:11:32,310
pain so let's pretend that you do now

00:11:29,879 --> 00:11:34,470
have some common b-hat tests or

00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:36,509
something like BLT in your back pocket

00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:38,310
and you've decided it is the best

00:11:36,509 --> 00:11:42,540
solution in the world and it's time for

00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:44,519
your organization to adopt it there's

00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:46,170
still a gap there right because just

00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:47,850
because you've started standardizing or

00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:51,779
even your team has started standardizing

00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:53,339
that doesn't mean that your cios office

00:11:51,779 --> 00:11:54,839
is going to go for it or the sharepoint

00:11:53,339 --> 00:11:56,339
team suddenly gonna flip over their

00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:58,350
table and decide to start using Drupal

00:11:56,339 --> 00:12:00,240
right there's there's still a gap from

00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:02,310
getting your head and your team in the

00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:04,589
right space to starting to build that

00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:07,680
support and if I had to boil this down

00:12:04,589 --> 00:12:10,649
to one suggestion it would be don't be

00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:12,240
this guy now if you haven't seen the IT

00:12:10,649 --> 00:12:13,769
Crowd it's getting a little dated but

00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,199
it's free on Netflix you should go watch

00:12:13,769 --> 00:12:17,880
it but also if you haven't seen the IT

00:12:16,199 --> 00:12:21,269
Crowd like moss is the epitome of

00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:23,639
everything an IT guy does wrong every

00:12:21,269 --> 00:12:25,350
conversation he has he assumes that the

00:12:23,639 --> 00:12:26,850
person he's talking to knows as much or

00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:29,189
more about what he's talking about as he

00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:31,290
does he refuses to talk to people at

00:12:29,189 --> 00:12:33,959
their level he basically calls everybody

00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:36,569
who isn't at his level stupid

00:12:33,959 --> 00:12:39,420
he's pretty antisocial which by the way

00:12:36,569 --> 00:12:41,519
if you're antisocial that's fine but

00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:44,759
he's like aggressively like throw you

00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:46,560
out of his office bad and you know

00:12:44,759 --> 00:12:48,720
anybody that tries to interact with him

00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,160
just usually runs away because it's such

00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:53,600
a terrible interaction they never want

00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:57,059
to talk to him again don't be that guy

00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:58,620
do talk to people at their level so if

00:12:57,059 --> 00:13:00,209
they come to you and by the way we're

00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:01,680
not talking about your solution your

00:13:00,209 --> 00:13:03,209
platform whatever we're just talking

00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,290
about relationship building here right

00:13:03,209 --> 00:13:06,029
if you have somebody that's

00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:07,889
non-technical and comes to you and you

00:13:06,029 --> 00:13:09,480
see him in the hall coming out of the

00:13:07,889 --> 00:13:11,699
bathroom heating up lunch and they ask

00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:14,189
you a question like answer it at their

00:13:11,699 --> 00:13:16,199
level talk to them be a genuinely kind

00:13:14,189 --> 00:13:17,580
human being and take the time to reach

00:13:16,199 --> 00:13:20,400
out and have an interaction

00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:22,170
they can understand if you are working

00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:25,860
with somebody on a project and you agree

00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:27,690
to do something do it right don't agree

00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:30,750
to do something that you're you're not

00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:33,000
willing to take on and do and this is

00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:35,400
actually a big one I've found repeatedly

00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:38,190
that the most direct fastest way to

00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:39,750
build confidence in your ability is to

00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:42,360
actually deliver what you say you're

00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:46,380
going to write success speaks louder

00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:48,930
than just about any other action say yes

00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:50,730
more than you say no to this day I still

00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:52,740
have people from previous jobs that

00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:54,300
email me and ask me questions because

00:13:52,740 --> 00:14:00,660
the people they work with always tell

00:13:54,300 --> 00:14:03,150
them no hey I want to do this no I'm not

00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:04,980
a yes-man but I will say yes much more

00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:08,250
than I say no when I say no it actually

00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:10,290
means something we say this a lot in

00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:12,900
consulting you want to become a trusted

00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:14,760
adviser if you're a trusted adviser and

00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:16,680
you go to somebody and say hey I have

00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:18,870
this cool new way that we're starting to

00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:20,430
build projects were automating our tests

00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:23,160
I think it'll really save us time and

00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:24,900
money the people that are listening to

00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:26,400
that argument are much more likely to

00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:29,010
listen to you and trust you in that

00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:31,050
context if you have a proven success

00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:32,850
record and you have a good relationship

00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:35,700
with them and you've built something

00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:37,650
right being the smart guy or the smart

00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:39,570
lady on a project doesn't necessarily

00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:43,080
get you a ton of cred when it comes to

00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:44,430
completely changing your approach but if

00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,960
you're a trusted adviser if these are

00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:47,760
people that normally come to you for

00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:49,530
help every now and again you're gonna

00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,900
have the opportunity to go back to them

00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:54,080
to try and get support for new things

00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:57,240
and exciting things and changing things

00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:58,740
and this last one I can't stress enough

00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:02,280
remember you're not the only smart

00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:04,290
person in the room it is really easy to

00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:05,730
see that something's not working it's

00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:07,680
really easy to see that you're doing

00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:09,600
something wrong but if you're just

00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:11,820
another person sitting on the sidelines

00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,170
sniping in saying oh this is dumb we

00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:15,900
shouldn't be doing this like that's not

00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:17,520
going to get you very far so other

00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:19,140
people know the problem you want to be

00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:21,810
the person that tries to bring a

00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:24,150
solution to the table identify the

00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:26,040
problem that's fine but identify the

00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:29,430
problem and then say here's what I think

00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:30,470
we should do about it so two takeaways

00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:32,450
here

00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:34,070
that organizations like like literally

00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:35,690
like the building isn't going to stop

00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:37,910
you from doing what you want to do it's

00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:39,310
the people that work there that are so

00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:41,900
if you're gonna try and affect change

00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:45,670
you have to have relationships with the

00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:50,000
people in order to drive that change and

00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:51,770
I can't like this is something just is

00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,690
always a factor like you have to be

00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:55,250
patient if you start a new job and you

00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:57,200
walk in and on day one and you're just

00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:59,630
like oh wow none of this is right I

00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:01,100
don't we got to change everything if you

00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:03,140
don't have trust if you don't have

00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:04,340
relationships with those people you're

00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:06,380
not going to be able to start driving

00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:08,450
that change nearly as much as you might

00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:09,950
after you've built trust after you've

00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:12,260
worked with them and you've built up

00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:16,880
that track record so definitely be

00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:18,230
patient and pick your battles so let's

00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,760
talk about this a little bit new

00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:22,190
directions and new approaches so we've

00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:24,380
got this idea we've started building

00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:28,010
some some trust we've started building

00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:29,480
some direction to actually get there but

00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:31,730
we're not all in alignment in how to

00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:35,000
solve the problem all right sometimes

00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:36,800
problems have wonky solutions when I

00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,380
first started freelancing about 15 years

00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:42,650
ago I read this book so it's it's been

00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:44,540
out a while and there's a story in it

00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:45,830
about the MTA which has a soft spot in

00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:49,450
my heart because I worked with them for

00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:53,420
a couple years and it talked a lot about

00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:56,060
how New York City cleaned up a lot of

00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:58,310
their safety and violence and crime

00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:59,720
issues in the late 80s and early 90s and

00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:02,150
it's a fascinating story because it's

00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:05,270
not they hired more cops it's not that

00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:09,980
they arrested more hooligans they bought

00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:12,740
some paint right so there's this idea of

00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:14,150
the like the broken window fallacy or

00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:16,010
theory right if you're walking down the

00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:18,140
street and you see a broken window

00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:19,460
you're going to assume that where you

00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:20,630
are is less safe

00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:23,570
you're gonna assume that where you are

00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:25,250
as a crappy part of town and in New York

00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:27,800
a lot of that was represented by

00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:30,860
graffiti specifically graffiti on the

00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:33,890
MTA's trains and they tried to combat

00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:36,710
this problem for years how do we stop

00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:38,780
people from painting our trains fun fact

00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:40,310
about the New York MTA there are so many

00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:43,280
trains in New York that they don't have

00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:44,000
a place to store all of them so if

00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,380
there's a

00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,210
if there's a flood if there's anything

00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:49,130
that ever shuts down the entire subway

00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:50,600
system they have to physically park the

00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:52,580
trains in the tunnels because there's no

00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:54,530
there's no yard big enough to store all

00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:56,360
the trains so it's not like you can put

00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:57,980
the Train someplace and lock a gate and

00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:59,480
keep people away from them I mean if you

00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:01,130
can get into the tunnel you can get into

00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:03,590
a truck you know you can get up to the

00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:05,390
train cars to spray-paint them so what

00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:07,340
they did was it several of the

00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:10,669
turnarounds in the cities they set up

00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:12,770
paint stations if a train came in and it

00:18:10,669 --> 00:18:14,620
had graffiti on it it did not go back

00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:16,970
out until the graffiti was painted over

00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:19,039
they let people in they let him paint

00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:20,990
him they didn't care you want to spend

00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:23,530
eight hours vandalizing my train I'm

00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:29,150
gonna spend 20 minutes erasing it

00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:30,440
the vandalism stopped I I think it's one

00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:32,299
of the most brilliant solutions to a

00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:34,580
problem I've ever heard I never would

00:18:32,299 --> 00:18:36,590
have thought of that and if I can leave

00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:38,240
you with anything today even with the

00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:42,110
best relationships even with the most

00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:43,700
brilliant idea sometimes you have to

00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:45,980
back up and think like an architect

00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:47,480
thinks and you have to think that a

00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:49,669
solution that's gonna get the most

00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:50,900
traction may not be a solution that

00:18:49,669 --> 00:18:53,270
anybody else has ever talked about

00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:54,710
before right if you have a Drupal team

00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:57,590
and a WordPress team and a SharePoint

00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:59,390
team everybody thinks theirs is the best

00:18:57,590 --> 00:19:02,150
you can't just always assume that I'm

00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:05,330
going to somehow convince you to use

00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:06,590
Drupal because Drupal is better I mean

00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:08,179
we're in a Drupal con I think I have a

00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:10,669
friend of the audience on that on that

00:19:08,179 --> 00:19:12,530
account but my point is that sometimes

00:19:10,669 --> 00:19:14,510
you have to find a completely different

00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:16,640
angle even if you do have the right

00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:17,870
relationship and you do have the right

00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:20,929
approach and you do have the right

00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:24,370
platform you still sometimes have to

00:19:20,929 --> 00:19:26,840
think outside the box to get that done

00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:30,049
so I want to make sure we had some time

00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:32,360
for questions in conclusion if I had to

00:19:30,049 --> 00:19:34,490
drill this down to like three very

00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:37,039
minimal thoughts work to become a

00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:38,990
trusted advisor that has nothing to do

00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:40,850
with your boss I mean hopefully your

00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:42,470
boss trusts you and it could very well

00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:44,809
be that you're building trust with

00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:46,669
somebody in a position of power your

00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:47,600
direct boss your boss's boss whoever

00:19:46,669 --> 00:19:50,390
that might be

00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:52,010
but become a trusted adviser and think

00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:54,590
about all things that are entailed in

00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:55,960
that that's not just manipulate people

00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:57,879
into doing what you want them to do

00:19:55,960 --> 00:20:00,490
that's genuinely build a relationship

00:19:57,879 --> 00:20:02,649
with people which may be a little

00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:05,619
outside your comfort zone I'm lucky I'm

00:20:02,649 --> 00:20:07,869
extroverted green badge right come talk

00:20:05,619 --> 00:20:09,940
to me but not everybody's like that and

00:20:07,869 --> 00:20:11,710
that's fine trust it doesn't mean you

00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:12,850
have to be out all the time interacting

00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:15,090
with people it just means you need to

00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:17,289
have the right interactions when you do

00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:19,929
design what you're building for reuse

00:20:17,289 --> 00:20:22,149
once you've got these relationships if

00:20:19,929 --> 00:20:24,429
you've got a good team if you've got a

00:20:22,149 --> 00:20:26,139
good foundation every time you build

00:20:24,429 --> 00:20:28,210
something you should have the

00:20:26,139 --> 00:20:30,610
opportunity to improve on what you did

00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:32,440
last time or reuse what you use last

00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:34,659
time to help further your cause that

00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:38,350
much farther you may end up with

00:20:34,659 --> 00:20:41,320
something like a distribution right

00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:44,559
there are many organizations that that

00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:46,259
starts small and end up with their very

00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:48,789
own Drupal ins the Drupal distribution

00:20:46,259 --> 00:20:51,129
open source or otherwise that they use

00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:53,110
every time you don't have to start there

00:20:51,129 --> 00:20:56,139
but you never know you might end up

00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:58,659
there and finally like I said look for

00:20:56,139 --> 00:21:00,820
that non-obvious solution there are so

00:20:58,659 --> 00:21:04,119
many opportunities to drive change in

00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:07,299
organizations that a lot of people

00:21:04,119 --> 00:21:08,769
probably do see so look for something

00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:11,169
that maybe is a little different than

00:21:08,769 --> 00:21:12,399
what other people have tried and you

00:21:11,169 --> 00:21:16,720
never know you might get a little bit

00:21:12,399 --> 00:21:18,820
more traction in that situation so with

00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:21,369
that we've got some time please use the

00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:27,659
mic if you have questions I love to talk

00:21:21,369 --> 00:21:27,659
about it anybody

00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:37,820
it is what is a nice way well so you

00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:39,850
still want to have some evidence to back

00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:43,220
up what you're talking about it right

00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:45,290
yeah yeah but the the thing that I think

00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:47,720
you have to be comfortable saying is

00:21:45,290 --> 00:21:49,760
that is wrong this is something I do

00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:53,930
with customers and projects and clients

00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:56,330
all the time we're gonna do X okay well

00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:59,810
why do you want to do X because we've

00:21:56,330 --> 00:22:02,510
always done X okay so what I've seen

00:21:59,810 --> 00:22:05,390
with X is usually that you get this far

00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:06,470
and then this goes wrong you don't want

00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:08,120
to just say all know you're wrong or you

00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:09,710
can't do it that way you want to try and

00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:11,060
tie it back anecdotally to something

00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:14,240
you've experienced or something you've

00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:17,690
seen and frequently you know as a

00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:18,890
consultant I frequently tell people

00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:21,890
don't do something and then they do it

00:22:18,890 --> 00:22:25,270
anyway and then what I said was gonna

00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:27,440
happen happens don't say I told you so

00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:29,000
then you say okay now can we revisit

00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,950
this and figure out how to get back out

00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,260
of this and stop it from happening right

00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:34,430
you you may very well tell somebody that

00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:35,660
something bad is going to happen and

00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:39,170
then something bad is going to happen

00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:41,120
then you take that point improve the

00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:44,230
relationship and try to build your way

00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:46,880
out of it from there

00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:50,350
thank you it's a good question anybody

00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:50,350
else yeah

00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,640
yep

00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:23,970
yeah yeah so the question in the comment

00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:25,980
there was just you know shouldn't the

00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:27,630
architect in the lead dev be building an

00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:28,950
architecture document and gathering

00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:30,420
consensus at the beginning of the

00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:31,740
project to make sure that everybody is

00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:33,840
on the same page and yeah I mean they

00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:35,400
should but I think what you're

00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,780
describing is a very healthy team

00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:38,520
dynamic and there's a lot of

00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:41,310
organizations and a lot of teams that

00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:42,720
don't have healthy team dynamics there's

00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:44,640
a lot of organizations that don't hire

00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:46,770
architects there's a lot of

00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:48,210
organizations that literally just say

00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:49,770
hey yeah go build this thing have fun

00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:51,240
like here's some money here's some time

00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:53,820
I need this thing figure it out

00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:55,380
so yes I mean like that is the perfect

00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:57,390
situation the architect the lead

00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:59,670
developer sort of prescribed what they

00:23:57,390 --> 00:24:02,220
want they give the team the opportunity

00:23:59,670 --> 00:24:04,050
to comment and sort of storm and norm

00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:05,940
that's very agile right let's have

00:24:04,050 --> 00:24:08,610
continuous improvement let's figure out

00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:11,190
how we can work together that should be

00:24:08,610 --> 00:24:12,720
your goal but in my experience there's

00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:15,000
an awful lot of organizations that

00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:17,490
either aren't agile at all so continuous

00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,740
improvement is incredibly alien to them

00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:21,060
or they're not set up to give their

00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:23,250
development teams or their their

00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:26,250
individual contributors the opportunity

00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:33,950
to sort of push back and say I think we

00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:33,950
should be doing it this way yeah

00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:41,870
yes yeah so the question there was just

00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:45,529
you know best practices would be hat

00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:47,539
tests right I mean so what the the best

00:24:45,529 --> 00:24:49,279
I think the least controversial best

00:24:47,539 --> 00:24:51,049
practice with a B hat test is it should

00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:52,400
be running on all of your continuous

00:24:51,049 --> 00:24:54,289
integration builds it should be running

00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,850
prior to your deployments and in this

00:24:54,289 --> 00:24:57,950
case since we didn't have any tests at

00:24:55,850 --> 00:25:00,080
all we weren't doing those things at all

00:24:57,950 --> 00:25:04,490
so in that case for me the line in the

00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:06,590
sand was I want to make sure that every

00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:08,750
pull request has B hat tests running I

00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:11,149
want to make sure that if the pull

00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:13,909
request does not pass B hat test it

00:25:11,149 --> 00:25:15,260
doesn't get merged when we merge we want

00:25:13,909 --> 00:25:17,210
an integration build to circle around

00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:19,700
and run the same tests again against the

00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:22,700
entire code base not just the the pull

00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:24,950
request that was that was the short-term

00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:26,659
goal there the longer-term goal is to

00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:28,610
actually have as close to a hundred

00:25:26,659 --> 00:25:30,350
percent coverage as possible for the

00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:34,250
custom features and functionalities that

00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:35,840
were actually built on the site best

00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:38,480
practice is there I think are probably a

00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:39,950
little more open to conversation

00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:41,659
depending on who you're working with but

00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:46,100
for me it's you know it's making sure

00:25:41,659 --> 00:25:48,320
that if a forum has custom code to do a

00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:49,820
form alter and change some behaviors on

00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:52,250
the forum theoretically there should be

00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:54,529
a test to make sure that the right level

00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:56,360
user can go to the forum do whatever it

00:25:54,529 --> 00:25:58,600
is they're trying to do see the expected

00:25:56,360 --> 00:26:01,850
behavior and also do a negative test

00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:03,380
that's a that's a that's just a good

00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:05,029
testing practice in general you

00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:06,440
shouldn't always just test the positive

00:26:05,029 --> 00:26:09,049
you should also test the negative

00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:10,490
because you know if all my tests are

00:26:09,049 --> 00:26:12,350
just testing is an authenticated user

00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:15,440
that will never test a problem for an

00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:17,000
anonymous user anyway I'm happy to nerd

00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:19,580
out on B hat test after if you have some

00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:22,580
more questions there yeah

00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:22,580
yep

00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:33,820
yeah so the question there is you know

00:26:30,970 --> 00:26:36,580
how do you manage AAB and I I'll be

00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:40,360
blunt sometimes you can't right I mean

00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:45,670
like they I have left companies before

00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:49,630
because I couldn't but I definitely find

00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:53,110
that h-1 trusted voice is better than an

00:26:49,630 --> 00:26:55,810
angry voice a group of voices on a team

00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:58,870
all saying the same thing is better than

00:26:55,810 --> 00:27:00,820
one trusted voice so if you're building

00:26:58,870 --> 00:27:03,070
consensus on your team if you're going

00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:04,960
back to your your your management or

00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:06,550
your team lead or whoever and you're

00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:09,610
trying to have these conversations you

00:27:06,550 --> 00:27:12,070
know I always say look for the victory

00:27:09,610 --> 00:27:14,260
you can find so I work a lot in the

00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:15,850
government space as I said something I

00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:19,330
hear a lot from government stakeholders

00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:21,190
is we really want to use Drupal VM but

00:27:19,330 --> 00:27:24,250
we can't because we don't get pseudo

00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:25,180
access on our laptops that's one you

00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:28,420
probably aren't going to be able to

00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:30,670
manage AAB right doesn't matter how much

00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:33,610
you tell them that we have to be able to

00:27:30,670 --> 00:27:36,220
do this like that's probably something

00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:38,350
even your boss can't change right if

00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:40,030
your government organization does not

00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:42,520
allow you to have root level access on

00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:44,170
your computer I don't know how high up

00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:47,770
you'd have to go to get that changed in

00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:50,440
that case I would abandon that fight and

00:27:47,770 --> 00:27:52,270
start looking for the next best thing

00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:53,910
right if I can't have a local

00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:59,560
environment or if I can't use Drupal VM

00:27:53,910 --> 00:28:01,120
what can I do to give me the same thing

00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:02,740
that a local would what's the next best

00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:05,800
thing and then you know have a fallback

00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:08,740
point right and I found really great

00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:10,540
success with that compromise model but

00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:12,610
it requires you to be able to sort of

00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:14,320
step back and not just get upset that

00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:16,390
they're telling you no it requires you

00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:17,830
to sort of see the forest or actually in

00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:19,300
that case maybe see the trees in the

00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:22,060
forest not the whole forest and

00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:23,950
understand am I even talking to the

00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:26,260
right person to manage up what I'm

00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:28,810
trying to fix and again that's where

00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:30,010
relationships really come in handy give

00:28:28,810 --> 00:28:33,690
me just a sec I thought I saw a hand

00:28:30,010 --> 00:28:33,690
over okay go for it

00:28:33,920 --> 00:29:04,640
yeah awesome congratulations to you now

00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:06,350
anyway just for the recording he was

00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:08,300
saying if you do have to have a fallback

00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:12,440
point and if you do have to perhaps not

00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:13,820
do the best practice keep track of what

00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:15,200
you have to do to work around that

00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:15,790
because it may help your argument in the

00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:19,400
future

00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:21,790
yeah for sure other questions or

00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,790
comments

00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:29,930
yeah nice at least for the exit

00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:31,970
interview that's good alright well I

00:29:29,930 --> 00:29:34,490
think we're at time anyway so thank you

00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:36,080
all for joining me if you are interested

00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:37,670
in building launch tools like I said we

00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:40,880
are having a buff later I think it's

00:29:37,670 --> 00:29:42,920
from 3:15 to 3:45 it's on the schedule

00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,940
so I'd love to see you there and I'll be

00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,990
around a little bit if you want to talk

00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:46,870
some more if you have some questions

00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:53,130
thanks everybody

00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:53,130
