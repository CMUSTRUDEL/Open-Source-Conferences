Title: DrupalCon Seattle 2019: Grouped User and Content Management in D8
Publication date: 2019-04-12
Playlist: Drupalcon Seattle 2019
Description: 
	OHSU is one of Portland, Oregon's largest employers—a research university and hospital with over 16,000 employees. And not one of those 16,000 employees is part of a centralized content team. This presentation is a case study in finding a technical solution to support decentralized content ownership in a large organization.

Although content creation and management is distributed across OHSU, we control the technology platform, code, and visual design. In 2017, we began to migrate 30K+ pages from a dated CMS to Drupal 8. We had to figure out how to provide some continuity in governance for the 300 contributors who may be responsible for content across a thousand entities. How could we support a decentralized approach to content ownership and avoid a sprawly mess of users, groups, menus, and roles?

We'll cover:

 The governance model (and lack thereof) that created this challenge

 Our initial technical architecture and why we didn't go with a multisite approach

 Why we chose the Group Contrib module and how we customized it

 The good and bad of this approach

 How we expect this to grow and change
