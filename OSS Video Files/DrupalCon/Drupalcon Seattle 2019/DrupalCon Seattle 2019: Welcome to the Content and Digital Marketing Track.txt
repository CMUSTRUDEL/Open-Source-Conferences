00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:26,340
already reminded you about cell phones

00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:28,049
so if you've just kind of stepped in the

00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:29,280
room in the last few minutes if you

00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:31,409
wouldn't mind turning off your cell

00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,240
phone that would be great if you need to

00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:37,530
take a call there's plenty of room

00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:39,270
