Publication date: 2019-04-11
Playlist: Drupalcon Seattle 2019
Description: 
	Imagine a group of people with different goals, perspectives, and strengths trying to solve an undefined problem. Sound impossible? Fortunately, there is much we can learn from a collaboration model that has existed for nearly fifty years: Dungeons & Dragons. Collaboration in a work environment has evolved and the way teams are defined is constantly changing. 

As a creative, problem-solving game, Dungeons and Dragon requires players to work together to succeed. They combine their individual strengths to collaborate, solve puzzles, learn from each other, and most importantly: defeat dragons. This session will explore the lessons we can learn from Dungeons & Dragons as a model for effective, creative teamwork.


What we will explore:

How to establish a collective goal and navigate solving a problem
Identifying strengths that individuals bring to a team and how to use that to an advantage
Questions to ask that will foster creativity in a team environment
