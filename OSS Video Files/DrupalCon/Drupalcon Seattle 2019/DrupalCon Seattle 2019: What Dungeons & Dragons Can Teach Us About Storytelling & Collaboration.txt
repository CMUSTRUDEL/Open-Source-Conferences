Title: DrupalCon Seattle 2019: What Dungeons & Dragons Can Teach Us About Storytelling & Collaboration
Publication date: 2019-04-11
Playlist: Drupalcon Seattle 2019
Description: 
	Imagine a group of people with different goals, perspectives, and strengths trying to solve an undefined problem. Sound impossible? Fortunately, there is much we can learn from a collaboration model that has existed for nearly fifty years: Dungeons & Dragons. Collaboration in a work environment has evolved and the way teams are defined is constantly changing. 

As a creative, problem-solving game, Dungeons and Dragon requires players to work together to succeed. They combine their individual strengths to collaborate, solve puzzles, learn from each other, and most importantly: defeat dragons. This session will explore the lessons we can learn from Dungeons & Dragons as a model for effective, creative teamwork.


What we will explore:

How to establish a collective goal and navigate solving a problem
Identifying strengths that individuals bring to a team and how to use that to an advantage
Questions to ask that will foster creativity in a team environment

okay it is a crisp cold evening the Sun

00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:15,750
has just set in the sky as that light

00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:18,810
blue sapphire color you taking a deep

00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:20,730
breath you can tell that it rained

00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:23,970
earlier in the day it has that fresh

00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:25,619
clean smell you hear the leaves rustling

00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:27,289
around you when you hear the animals

00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:29,730
starting to settle down for the night

00:00:27,289 --> 00:00:32,759
you and your friends have been set out

00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:35,030
on an adventure you are tasked with

00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:38,010
going into the Elven city of Erdos

00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:40,440
retrieving a magical artifact and then

00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:42,480
your true mission is to defeat a dragon

00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:46,440
that has been causing terror and mass

00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:48,300
destruction nearby the elven city is

00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:50,700
hidden amongst the woods that you see in

00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:53,550
front of you you and your friends set

00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:55,500
out on the adventure you start to travel

00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:57,840
through the woods at first it's fun

00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:00,090
you're hanging out you're making jokes

00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,640
you're laughing and then it feels like

00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:06,869
you've been traveling for hours the air

00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:08,340
draws cold too cold you get the chilled

00:01:06,869 --> 00:01:10,860
on the back of your neck like

00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:12,720
something's coming you start to get the

00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:17,390
feeling that something's watching you

00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:19,650
waiting for you may be preying upon you

00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:22,560
my name is Jessica Tate

00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:26,700
I am a art director at Fang Xiao think

00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:28,619
Xiao is a agency and we do strategy

00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:32,100
design and development for mission

00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:34,799
driven organizations so by day I do

00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:37,560
creative and design by night I am a

00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:40,860
dungeon master to a group of eight

00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:42,479
awesome badass women I'm actually so

00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:44,009
happy that there are so many women in

00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:45,630
the crowd today I for sure thought that

00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:49,259
there were gonna be a lot of men given

00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:52,380
the topic of the talk I also play a

00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:53,759
level 3 rogue and a level 12 wizard if

00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:55,020
you have no idea what that means don't

00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:58,110
worry I'm going to talk about what

00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:59,969
Dungeons & Dragons is I probably haven't

00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:02,340
been playing as long as some of the

00:01:59,969 --> 00:02:05,250
people in the room today but what really

00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:07,110
excites me about D&D specifically is all

00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:09,390
of the lessons and stories that we can

00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:11,250
get from it and how we can apply it to

00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:13,180
working in teams working with clients

00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:15,689
and working more Claire

00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:18,489
creatively and creatively together

00:02:15,689 --> 00:02:20,469
dungeons and what can I get a show of

00:02:18,489 --> 00:02:23,950
hands of people who have played or watch

00:02:20,469 --> 00:02:24,549
Dungeons and Dragons before ok cool very

00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:29,680
cool

00:02:24,549 --> 00:02:31,900
so apparently Seattle oops Seattle has

00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,909
also played Dungeons and Dragons I was

00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:35,500
at Barnes & Noble yesterday after I got

00:02:33,909 --> 00:02:37,480
in from the train from Portland and

00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:39,819
there is an entire Dungeons & Dragons

00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:41,379
section here at this Barnes & Noble in

00:02:39,819 --> 00:02:43,599
Portland we just have like a little tiny

00:02:41,379 --> 00:02:45,970
shelf for Dungeons and Dragons and if

00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:47,769
you look really closely on the right the

00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:49,689
books apparently are so popular that

00:02:47,769 --> 00:02:51,609
they are alarmed there are no other

00:02:49,689 --> 00:02:54,340
books around them that are alarmed so

00:02:51,609 --> 00:02:57,040
certainly something that is becoming and

00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:58,629
growing more and more in popularity you

00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:01,030
might have heard of Dungeons & Dragons

00:02:58,629 --> 00:03:02,680
because of this show stranger things

00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:05,349
it's one of the things that they are

00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:08,409
playing uh one of the best ways I can

00:03:05,349 --> 00:03:10,629
describe D&D is that it's like a murder

00:03:08,409 --> 00:03:13,840
mystery party so you are showing up as a

00:03:10,629 --> 00:03:15,370
character and you and your group have a

00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,769
goal that you're trying to accomplish

00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:20,919
that session or throughout multiple

00:03:17,769 --> 00:03:22,870
sessions you have a dungeon master which

00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:24,519
is the narrator or the storyteller and

00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:26,169
helps like guide the story along much

00:03:24,519 --> 00:03:28,030
like you would need in a murder mystery

00:03:26,169 --> 00:03:29,370
party someone that actually knows who

00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:32,379
the murderer is

00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:34,299
along with D&D and this idea of

00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:36,400
collaborative storytelling you have

00:03:34,299 --> 00:03:39,729
these infamous dice where I passed out

00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:41,650
already 3d 20s the d20 is like the most

00:03:39,729 --> 00:03:44,229
common dice that you have for Dungeons

00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:46,319
and Dragons and what this dice does is

00:03:44,229 --> 00:03:49,389
it allows a little bit of structure

00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:52,810
amidst a game that is very verbal and

00:03:49,389 --> 00:03:55,599
very I in the moment as reacting to each

00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:57,340
other it also means that depending on

00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:59,470
what you roll depends on how the story

00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:01,780
goes so you can roll a 1 which is the

00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:03,699
worst on a d20 and automatically fail

00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:05,889
whatever you're trying to do or you can

00:04:03,699 --> 00:04:08,379
roll a 20 and that is a great success

00:04:05,889 --> 00:04:11,530
and you probably succeed at what you're

00:04:08,379 --> 00:04:14,229
trying to do so it really helps adjust

00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:16,479
the story based on what you are talking

00:04:14,229 --> 00:04:18,820
about and how like you as your character

00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:20,470
are trying to interact with objects and

00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:22,750
other people in different things

00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:25,060
throughout the night it's the beginning

00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:27,370
story let's get back into it

00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:29,530
so can I have the person with the green

00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:38,110
dice roll the dice and tell me what you

00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:41,470
get okay so you spot in the bushes two

00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:43,480
pairs of yellow eyes staring at you it

00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:45,820
gives you with that roll just enough

00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:47,560
time for you to tell your friends hey

00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:51,250
there's something up in the bushes and

00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:53,980
just then a monster comes and jumps out

00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:57,280
at you and you and your friends start up

00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:59,200
in battle the fighter the strong one of

00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:01,180
the group grabs his sword starts running

00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:04,000
up towards this monster and start

00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:07,150
swinging recklessly at this what we now

00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,520
know are werewolves the stealthy one the

00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:11,710
rogue using opportune moments and

00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:14,410
surprise attacks sneaks around and

00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:16,479
throws a dagger and hits the werewolf in

00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:19,330
a critical oragon causing the werewolf

00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:21,610
to fall three other werewolves jump out

00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:24,310
from behind and ambush the party but

00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:27,100
these are no problem for these three

00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:29,290
friends or for friends the cleric the

00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:31,780
one who is the supporter of the group

00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:33,580
the healer starts to watch the fighter

00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:36,430
and whenever the fighter takes a slash

00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:39,729
from the werewolf cause Klaus instantly

00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:42,160
helps mend those wounds the wizard in

00:05:39,729 --> 00:05:44,289
the back watching trying to find the

00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:47,200
perfect time to cast a spell creates

00:05:44,289 --> 00:05:49,240
three magical purple darts and strikes

00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:52,539
at the werewolf and another one easily

00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:54,400
falls in a short matter of time all five

00:05:52,539 --> 00:05:57,550
werewolves or four werewolves are how

00:05:54,400 --> 00:06:00,970
many there are fall the party gathers

00:05:57,550 --> 00:06:03,160
themselves a little bit damaged realizes

00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:07,150
that the forests are full of danger and

00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:09,970
moves on towards the city so one of the

00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:13,000
first lessons that we can talk about is

00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:14,710
teamwork and collaboration talking a

00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,880
little bit about what this means and

00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:17,650
what I just talked about if some of

00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:20,740
those words were foreign to you these

00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:23,620
are the four main pillars of D&D you

00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:25,900
have a fighter who is often the warrior

00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:29,020
the soldier in the person that is going

00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:31,690
to be use in wield like typical common

00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:33,940
weapons like swords or battle axes you

00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:36,130
have the cleric who is often inspired by

00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:37,510
divine magic and is really good at

00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:40,180
healing or men

00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:42,520
or using a kind of like a first aid

00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:44,200
ability to be able to keep their friends

00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:46,360
in battle for as long as possible

00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:48,340
you have the rogue or the sneaky

00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:50,350
character kind of like Batman that often

00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:52,360
has a hood up and is trying to find the

00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:54,940
most opportune moments to surprise or

00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:57,100
attack their foes and then you have the

00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:58,900
wizard and probably because of Harry

00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:01,830
Potter a lot of people know what wizards

00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:04,750
are but they cast spells and use magic I

00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:06,790
there are a lot of other classes in D&D

00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:09,400
but for the purpose of today I want to

00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:11,620
talk about just these four in looking at

00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,970
that story I just told you might have

00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:14,830
started to pick out some strengths and

00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:17,230
weaknesses through the characters the

00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:18,850
fighter was instantly the one the one

00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:20,470
who's wearing armor and battling the

00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:23,320
sword up close and personal with the

00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:25,210
werewolf whereas the wizard stood back a

00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:29,620
little bit they waited for the moment

00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:33,340
that felt right to cast spells so while

00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:35,500
this is fun and D&D as fun as I started

00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:38,020
to play more and more D&D and especially

00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:40,690
as I dungeon mastered for this group of

00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:41,830
women I started to think to myself what

00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:44,350
if I was a character

00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:46,210
what like would my strengths be as a

00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:48,430
person in a group that is working

00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:50,950
because I work a lot in project teams

00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:53,620
and so I started to ask myself what are

00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:56,050
my strengths and weaknesses and what I

00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:58,030
think is interesting is that when you

00:07:56,050 --> 00:08:00,460
are in a project team much like D&D

00:07:58,030 --> 00:08:01,960
they're very clear defined strengths and

00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:04,210
weaknesses of all of the team members

00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:06,430
and the group so when you think about

00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:08,650
the wizard their strength is staying

00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:10,810
staying back in waiting for the right

00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:12,850
time to cast the spell when I think

00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:14,980
about the value that I add as an art

00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:17,260
director I'm able to bring in a

00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:19,030
perspective of how visually different

00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:22,120
ideas come to life whether that's

00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:27,010
through sketch or Photoshop or on the

00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:29,290
web and so that unique perspective is

00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:31,120
gonna be different than perhaps a my

00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:32,860
fellow coworker who's a project manager

00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:35,080
who is focused on the budget and the

00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:36,970
timeline when you put those forces

00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:38,830
together and you start working together

00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:40,750
as a team you're each going to be coming

00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:42,160
at it with different perspectives so I

00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:44,020
would encourage you to think about what

00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:45,220
are your strengths when you are in a

00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:48,130
group of people and you're collaborating

00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:50,230
and you're brainstorming what unique

00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:51,070
thing do you bring to the table that

00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:52,930
maybe someone else

00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:55,930
and can you add your voice and help

00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:57,790
support the situation also what are your

00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:59,320
weaknesses and this was a little bit

00:08:57,790 --> 00:09:00,910
harder for me to think because I think

00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:02,649
it's easier for us to identify your

00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:04,750
strengths maybe some of us it's easy to

00:09:02,649 --> 00:09:06,279
identify our weaknesses but I had to

00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:08,649
really think when I am in a group of

00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:10,990
people like where do I have to rely on

00:09:08,649 --> 00:09:13,750
my friends to help support in the spaces

00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:16,420
that I'm not as good so for example the

00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:17,860
wizard has to rely on the fighter to be

00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:19,480
able to take the hits because if the

00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:21,040
wizard takes a hit it's gonna go down

00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:23,529
instantly because they're not wearing

00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:25,000
armor so when I think about working in a

00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:28,149
project team one of my personal

00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,459
weaknesses is writing I have dyslexia

00:09:28,149 --> 00:09:33,699
and so while I can write it takes me a

00:09:30,459 --> 00:09:36,310
very long time so I have to use and and

00:09:33,699 --> 00:09:38,560
I'm use the support of my team members

00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:43,240
to be able to help communicate through

00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:45,040
writing and be able to take notes the

00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:46,750
difference is that we all have together

00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,399
when we're working on a team makes us

00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:50,380
stronger and that's what I really

00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:53,290
appreciate about Dungeons & Dragons is

00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:55,360
that together as a group of people you

00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:57,399
were stronger than just one individual

00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:00,760
person your friends will help offset

00:09:57,399 --> 00:10:03,339
your weaknesses and it's really becomes

00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:04,899
a celebration and you're able to see the

00:10:03,339 --> 00:10:07,180
moment when your friend is shining

00:10:04,899 --> 00:10:09,970
because it's you recognize that's not

00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:17,680
value that you can necessarily add as

00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:21,459
easily so there's a clearing in the

00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:24,339
forest you see the lights of Erdos the

00:10:21,459 --> 00:10:26,740
elven city off in the distance you see a

00:10:24,339 --> 00:10:28,300
campfire and you get that people are

00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:31,060
probably gathering around it for the

00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:33,760
nighttime there's a large building on

00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:36,790
the right you've been told this is the

00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:38,769
building with the artifact you and your

00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:40,209
friends are standing on the outside of

00:10:38,769 --> 00:10:41,760
the city and you have to figure out what

00:10:40,209 --> 00:10:44,560
is the plan how are you gonna infiltrate

00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:45,910
the Rogue speaks up and says I'm sneaky

00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:48,279
I can just sneak in and steal the

00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:50,529
artifact and be out in a jiffy The

00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:52,839
Fighter a little bit more bullish says

00:10:50,529 --> 00:10:54,730
yeah but what if you trip and fall or

00:10:52,839 --> 00:10:57,550
something we need to make this a little

00:10:54,730 --> 00:11:00,550
bit better so the fighter oftens offers

00:10:57,550 --> 00:11:01,830
to pretend to be drunk and start a brawl

00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:04,170
in the center of

00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:06,150
the cleric then adds in well what if I

00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:07,650
add some like fireworks sound effects

00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:10,920
and that will help draw more attention

00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:13,350
so that we can get people away from this

00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:15,900
main building the Wizards sitting there

00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:18,720
thinking trying to figure out how to

00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:20,670
outsmart this situation says well what

00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,830
if I go with the rogue and I can stand

00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:26,370
back and potentially charm a guard in

00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:28,320
case a guard happens to be there so the

00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:32,490
person with the blue dice can you please

00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:35,850
roll your D twenty times you get okay

00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:37,860
pretty good so the four of you set off

00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:39,810
the plan is in action

00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:41,250
the rogue starts sneaking into the main

00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:43,710
building to retrieve this magical

00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:45,690
artifact the brawl starts happening with

00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:48,270
the fighter it's a friendly ball for all

00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:50,940
it's not too much the fireworks go off a

00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:52,620
lot of attention is centered towards the

00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:56,370
center of town away from this main

00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:58,500
building because of the 14 the rogue is

00:11:56,370 --> 00:12:00,960
easily able to sneak in steal the

00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:02,610
artifact the wizard is there on standby

00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:04,320
just in case of guard notices in this

00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:07,260
case no one does notice because that was

00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:09,060
a pretty good role and at the end of the

00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:12,510
day the plan goes off without a hitch

00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:17,280
the magical art attract is the magical

00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:22,650
artifact is acquired and the party is

00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:24,750
able to continue on creativity so in

00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:27,300
this particular example and the story I

00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:29,820
just told the problem or the goal was

00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:32,130
easily defined the adventuring party

00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:33,839
knew what the problem was going into it

00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:36,300
that they had to retrieve the artifact

00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:38,580
but this isn't always the case when

00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:40,500
you're working in a group of people in a

00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:42,630
team it's really easy to get lost in the

00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:44,760
details if it's easy to lose sight of

00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:48,420
what are we actually solving for what is

00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:50,730
our actual goal this also happens in D&D

00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:52,680
all the time where you often forget what

00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:55,110
it is you're trying to do or you forget

00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:57,080
what the goal is and so if you are

00:12:55,110 --> 00:13:00,000
working with a group of people often

00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:01,830
creativity comes from a problem that

00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,589
you're trying to solve those constraints

00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:07,560
will help guide the group in a way that

00:13:04,589 --> 00:13:09,450
allows creativity to prosper so when

00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:11,190
you're thinking about trying to solve

00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:13,130
problems make sure that problem is

00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:14,850
clearly identified and that the goal is

00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:17,429
easily

00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:19,109
understood by everyone in the group more

00:13:17,429 --> 00:13:21,539
specifically make sure that everyone

00:13:19,109 --> 00:13:24,359
knows what that goal is and are aligned

00:13:21,539 --> 00:13:25,559
on that goal I also see this a lot like

00:13:24,359 --> 00:13:28,199
especially when working with clients

00:13:25,559 --> 00:13:29,910
where the goal of our project team might

00:13:28,199 --> 00:13:31,410
be different than the goal of the client

00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:35,939
so see if you can try to find alignment

00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:37,519
there and it will allow creativity to be

00:13:35,939 --> 00:13:41,069
unleashed

00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:43,079
another quick tool is speaking of tool

00:13:41,069 --> 00:13:45,449
is actually just talking about what

00:13:43,079 --> 00:13:47,459
tools you have available to you so in

00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:50,129
the example the wizard said well I have

00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:52,410
a spell that can help charm a guard that

00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:54,629
wizard is uniquely bringing something to

00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:57,029
the table that the fighter can't because

00:13:54,629 --> 00:13:58,739
the fighter can't cast the spell so in

00:13:57,029 --> 00:14:00,929
our case when we're working in project

00:13:58,739 --> 00:14:03,959
teams can you think of the tools that

00:14:00,929 --> 00:14:06,179
you have available to you this is also

00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:08,160
something that's pulled from improv

00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:09,689
where in improv you'll see a lot of

00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,339
times someone say I've got a crowbar in

00:14:09,689 --> 00:14:14,309
a rope is there anything we can do with

00:14:11,339 --> 00:14:16,919
it and because I've labeled those two

00:14:14,309 --> 00:14:18,809
tools instantly in your mind you have an

00:14:16,919 --> 00:14:20,669
idea of what a crowbar in a rope is and

00:14:18,809 --> 00:14:22,350
now your mind is starting to think about

00:14:20,669 --> 00:14:24,600
ways that you might be able to use that

00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:26,369
rope in ways that maybe I haven't or

00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:28,889
perhaps you can use that rope with

00:14:26,369 --> 00:14:30,299
something in your inventory so as we're

00:14:28,889 --> 00:14:35,069
working together can you think about

00:14:30,299 --> 00:14:36,959
ways that you have that you are using as

00:14:35,069 --> 00:14:39,029
your tools so for example as an art

00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:41,220
director I use Photoshop a lot so I

00:14:39,029 --> 00:14:43,499
could potentially say in a teamwork

00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:46,679
environment hey I've got I've got

00:14:43,499 --> 00:14:48,449
Photoshop like could we in use this

00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:51,449
image and manipulate it in some way so

00:14:48,449 --> 00:14:55,589
that we can have some sort of cool

00:14:51,449 --> 00:14:57,629
design eye what I you did there is talk

00:14:55,589 --> 00:15:00,419
not only about Photoshop as the tool but

00:14:57,629 --> 00:15:02,850
also what Photoshop could do just

00:15:00,419 --> 00:15:05,579
because it's not as clear like what a

00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:07,139
crowbar in a rope could do I also

00:15:05,579 --> 00:15:10,949
mentioned this because something like

00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:12,779
more specific like PHP or like more

00:15:10,949 --> 00:15:15,809
things that people aren't always aware

00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:17,609
of if you classify it as PHP is really

00:15:15,809 --> 00:15:20,720
good at databases can we use this

00:15:17,609 --> 00:15:22,919
database in a way that will help us

00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,989
create pizza toppings

00:15:22,919 --> 00:15:26,819
I don't know right so try to like

00:15:24,989 --> 00:15:28,350
clarify not only state the tools that

00:15:26,819 --> 00:15:31,980
you have but also talk about what those

00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:33,960
tools do it also helps you connect to

00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:34,850
one another and take ideas and build

00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:37,380
upon them

00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:39,450
speaking of building upon them one of my

00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:41,540
favorite things of D&D is you end up in

00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:44,490
scenarios that feel crazy

00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:46,290
for example in that story someone could

00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:48,090
have recommended turning into a dinosaur

00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:50,640
and marching through town and causing

00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:52,980
chaos and the cleric could have turned

00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:55,590
the dragon on or the dinosaur on fire

00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:57,630
there's this real childlike creativity

00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:59,820
that happens in D&D and that's because

00:15:57,630 --> 00:16:02,490
of this principle of yes and which also

00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:04,350
is stolen from improv where you take one

00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:06,150
idea that's a good idea like the rogue

00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:08,250
sneaking into the building to steal the

00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:11,130
artifact and then you build upon it and

00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:12,750
you have other layers that help add to

00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:16,320
the overall story that you're trying to

00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:18,480
tell I think that this childlike

00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:21,210
creativity is super important especially

00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:25,080
as creatives and content creators

00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:27,180
because tapping into what it was like to

00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:29,550
be creative as a child is something that

00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:33,720
we know from psychology is really

00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:37,470
helpful in unleashing more creativity as

00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:40,740
a person so D&D is a great way to have

00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:43,830
that framework the more that you can be

00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:45,360
in your day job or working and thinking

00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:47,040
about like how would I solve this as a

00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:50,040
child or what are like the crazy ideas

00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:52,170
don't like don't put those ideas aside

00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:53,880
until you fully explored them because

00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:56,730
maybe there's something within that idea

00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:58,680
that it's fun and different you can

00:16:56,730 --> 00:17:01,740
always go back to the simple idea but

00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:05,100
try to like use not only the crazy ideas

00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:11,250
but also ideas that are built upon with

00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:16,830
other friends the want to make sure it's

00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:18,930
come on play oh it's not playing it's

00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:23,010
supposed to be a gif of a dice rolling

00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:24,840
um of course we're rolling dice here as

00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:27,060
a part of the story and I'm actually

00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:28,380
adjusting the story I'm telling based on

00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:31,080
the dice rules that you're telling me

00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:33,540
and I think that's really interesting as

00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:36,420
it relates to D&D and certainly a lesson

00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:38,190
that I learned is you can have all the

00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:40,470
information and you can have the perfect

00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:42,960
plan and you can still fail

00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:47,630
you can still have a client presentation

00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:50,400
that bombs or you can still have a a

00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:52,950
piece of art that no one likes or a

00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,360
piece of content that no one likes and

00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:56,549
it doesn't mean that you're necessarily

00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:59,010
bad at what you do it just means that

00:17:56,549 --> 00:18:00,750
the dice weren't with you that day I

00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:02,400
know that seems kind of silly but I do

00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:05,490
think it's really important to recognize

00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:07,470
that even having all the tools you have

00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:10,679
in all of the creativity you can have

00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:13,500
there are still times of chance where it

00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:14,970
just might not be up to you that day and

00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,620
there are also gonna be times where it's

00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:18,870
gonna be a total success and maybe you

00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:21,659
weren't expecting it so think about that

00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:25,669
dice as that element of chance and how

00:18:21,659 --> 00:18:25,669
that might apply to your day-to-day life

00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:32,909
so the artifact is acquired you and your

00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:36,450
friends can now enter into the caves

00:18:32,909 --> 00:18:39,210
where the dragon dwells you approach the

00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:42,780
caves and it smells rancid there are

00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:46,590
rotting carcasses and bones everywhere

00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:48,480
you look deeper into the cave and you

00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:51,360
can see that it becomes denser with

00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:54,659
these bones and carcasses you hear the

00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:57,900
occasional drip from the ceiling you

00:18:54,659 --> 00:19:00,750
begin to adventure in deeper you can

00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:02,909
hear off in the distance the breathing

00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:06,570
and snarls of what you assume is the

00:19:02,909 --> 00:19:09,659
dragon you begin to descend down into

00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:15,360
this massive cavern it's huge 80-foot

00:19:09,659 --> 00:19:18,570
tall ceilings in the center is a red

00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:20,070
dragon waiting for you and ready can I

00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:27,900
have the person with the red dice roll

00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:33,180
the dice okay

00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:37,260
at nine or six six okay not great so the

00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:39,390
dragon gets to go first noticing you and

00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:42,270
watching you come down into Sun down

00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:45,000
into the cavern the dragon instantly

00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:47,390
leaps out and starts using its claws and

00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:50,010
mouth to start attacking your fighter

00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:52,050
without hesitation the fighter snaps

00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:54,630
back with the sword and starts attacking

00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:56,790
the dragon but this dragon is strong the

00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:59,010
wizard casts a spell that causes a black

00:19:56,790 --> 00:20:01,380
acre to seep out of the scales around

00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:03,720
the dragon's body the rogue with the

00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:05,880
unnatural speed starts throwing daggers

00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:08,040
and trying to find those moments of

00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:11,040
maybe where the wizard just had casted

00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:13,650
that spell the dragon continues to bite

00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:15,840
and claw down at the fighter and the

00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:17,730
rogue the cleric still watching the

00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:19,950
situation continues to try to heal

00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:22,110
whenever they can and perhaps in this

00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:23,760
instant cast a spell to give them

00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:27,510
insight into some of the dragon's

00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:29,400
weaknesses after a few rounds of battle

00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:32,309
that dragon attacking the group

00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:33,960
attacking the dragon takes a moment

00:20:32,309 --> 00:20:36,390
steps back

00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:39,600
the group thinks that the fight is done

00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:41,970
and then you hear this loud roar and the

00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:44,520
dragon lets out this massive dragon

00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:50,940
breath follow behind it this fireball

00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:54,150
that takes over the party sorry oh man I

00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:57,420
the group instantly starts to get burned

00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:58,890
and the wizard not wearing armor also in

00:20:57,420 --> 00:21:01,110
the dragon breath falls to the ground

00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:03,450
the rest of the party looks around

00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:06,360
feeling like they're about to fall any

00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:07,980
moment then in the rogue's pouch from

00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:10,050
the magical artifact that they stole

00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:12,150
they can feel the slight hum and the

00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:14,850
vibration of this artifact starting to

00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:17,510
seemingly activate the rogue pulls it

00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:21,270
out and notices that it's glowing

00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:23,130
ready-to-work starts and without knowing

00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:25,290
how to use it throws it at the dragon it

00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:28,800
creates this bright white pulse of light

00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:30,720
and the dragon is temporarily blinded

00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:33,090
knowing that the wizard has fallen to

00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:34,679
the ground seemingly unconscious and the

00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:36,600
group doesn't know what to do they just

00:21:34,679 --> 00:21:38,760
keep doing what they know best

00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:40,650
the rogue continues to throw daggers the

00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:41,049
cleric tries to he looks at the wizard

00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:42,460
thank you

00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:43,980
should I try to get it back up or do I

00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:46,600
take this moment and fight the dragon

00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:49,119
knowing that the dragon must be defeated

00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:51,279
the cleric throws an axe towards the

00:21:49,119 --> 00:21:52,989
dragon the fighter seeing the dragon in

00:21:51,279 --> 00:21:55,419
its blind the state in this moment of

00:21:52,989 --> 00:21:58,239
panic use his sword and uppercuts up

00:21:55,419 --> 00:22:01,330
into the mouth and with that you hear

00:21:58,239 --> 00:22:04,210
the lard boom of the body as the

00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:06,399
dragon's body hits the bottom of the

00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:08,259
cavern you have defeated the dragon

00:22:06,399 --> 00:22:10,029
without an instant without a breath

00:22:08,259 --> 00:22:12,340
though cleric knows that the wizard is

00:22:10,029 --> 00:22:15,989
still dying on the floor runs over and

00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:15,989
heals him and brings him back to life

00:22:16,409 --> 00:22:25,899
story telling something that is really

00:22:23,169 --> 00:22:28,929
fun about D&D is this idea of the story

00:22:25,899 --> 00:22:30,970
and it's constantly changing just like I

00:22:28,929 --> 00:22:32,859
adjusted this story and had the dragon

00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:35,409
goat first if you had brought higher you

00:22:32,859 --> 00:22:36,730
guys would have gone first so think

00:22:35,409 --> 00:22:40,149
about that when you're in a group of

00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:41,409
people can you adjust and react based on

00:22:40,149 --> 00:22:43,539
what other people are saying I know

00:22:41,409 --> 00:22:45,100
especially for me it's often easy for me

00:22:43,539 --> 00:22:46,840
to get in my own head and want to get my

00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:48,609
own ideas out there but if you're

00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:50,590
actually reacting to what people are

00:22:48,609 --> 00:22:52,720
saying and building upon different ideas

00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:53,950
you might have different unexpected

00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:57,159
outcomes that you wouldn't have

00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:59,409
originally thought I love it because it

00:22:57,159 --> 00:23:01,539
forces people to react in the moment in

00:22:59,409 --> 00:23:03,549
D&D and you have to adjust and change

00:23:01,539 --> 00:23:08,109
what you're doing because of the roll of

00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:09,669
the dice I also don't want you to be

00:23:08,109 --> 00:23:12,100
afraid of imperfection when you're

00:23:09,669 --> 00:23:14,980
telling stories moments that cause

00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:17,409
humility I can tell you personally that

00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:19,570
as a rogue I was running off a balcony

00:23:17,409 --> 00:23:21,759
which it's supposed to be pretty easy

00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:23,889
for me and I rolled a 1 so I failed so I

00:23:21,759 --> 00:23:26,669
just curse splatted off of the balcony

00:23:23,889 --> 00:23:29,379
but I remember that moment you remember

00:23:26,669 --> 00:23:32,169
failures and you remember moments of

00:23:29,379 --> 00:23:34,389
real emotional stress because it's

00:23:32,169 --> 00:23:36,999
connecting to you in a way that is more

00:23:34,389 --> 00:23:39,009
impactful than just telling a factual

00:23:36,999 --> 00:23:40,480
story we also know this because if you

00:23:39,009 --> 00:23:43,059
think back to your childhood probably

00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:44,859
the memories that you have in your

00:23:43,059 --> 00:23:48,489
memory the strongest are the memories

00:23:44,859 --> 00:23:50,980
that are full of emotion as a child can

00:23:48,489 --> 00:23:53,159
we tell stories that bring a motion to

00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:54,880
the surface both positive and negative

00:23:53,159 --> 00:23:56,800
don't be afraid

00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:58,960
stories that feel a little bit awkward

00:23:56,800 --> 00:24:00,430
or feel different because I think you're

00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:03,490
gonna remember those than the like

00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:06,850
perfectly crafted story that like tells

00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:10,000
the story of the company in the perfect

00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:15,010
way stories connect us together and

00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:16,540
allow us to understand each other if you

00:24:15,010 --> 00:24:18,460
also were paying attention I've used

00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:20,020
multiple senses when I've talked about

00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:22,720
telling these stories throughout each

00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:24,940
story bead and it's because when you

00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:28,150
talk through multiple senses like sight

00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:30,550
hearing smell touch you're able to

00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:32,350
connect in a way that feels more organic

00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:34,150
and human because you're not just taking

00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:36,220
one input you're forced to think about

00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:38,170
multiple inputs so when you are telling

00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:41,350
stories can you think about using not

00:24:38,170 --> 00:24:43,060
just one sense can you use sound to help

00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:45,580
add to the story although be another web

00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:47,890
sound isn't great but can you use other

00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:51,120
things like can you describe through

00:24:47,890 --> 00:24:53,800
touch what it might feel like or add

00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:56,770
various senses to help tell a more

00:24:53,800 --> 00:25:01,050
impactful story it makes it stronger

00:24:56,770 --> 00:25:01,050
more piece personal and more relatable

00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:09,070
so this concludes the adventure of our

00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:11,170
four friends who have defeated the red

00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:13,330
dragon and stole the magical artifact

00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:17,380
from Erdos they did return the magical

00:25:13,330 --> 00:25:19,750
artifact for now they are happy and safe

00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:22,510
and feel a little bit stronger not only

00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:24,130
as warriors but also as friends because

00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:26,500
they went into a dragon's lair and

00:25:24,130 --> 00:25:29,740
defeated the dragon there is probably

00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:32,350
another adventure in their near future

00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:35,460
but they never know what is lurking

00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:35,460
around the corner

00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:39,180
thank you

00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:49,090
we probably don't have much time for

00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:51,429
questions but maybe if there's like one

00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:52,899
or two questions I want to make sure I

00:25:51,429 --> 00:25:56,169
give you time to get to other sessions

00:25:52,899 --> 00:26:00,360
Oh in the people with the dice you get

00:25:56,169 --> 00:26:00,360
to keep them yeah

00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:11,419
