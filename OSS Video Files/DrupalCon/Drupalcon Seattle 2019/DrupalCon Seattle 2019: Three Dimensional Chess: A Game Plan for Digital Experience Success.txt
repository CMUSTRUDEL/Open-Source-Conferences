I like that what's that again thumbs up

00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:08,670
I even have a little scream I like that

00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:10,349
we've got an awesome topic okay and I'm

00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:12,300
gonna be collecting some I'm gonna be

00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:14,219
presenting some collective wisdom from

00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:15,660
not just my personal experience but

00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:18,330
things that I've learned from some of

00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:20,640
the best in the business and for those

00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:22,920
that are trying to tackle digital

00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,660
experience I'm gonna give you some of

00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:27,000
the best practices that I've observed

00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:29,310
and others have collected over years of

00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,830
trying to do this I'm also gonna shoot

00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:33,660
straight with you like I'm not gonna

00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:36,559
pretend that I have all the answers no

00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:38,700
one really does so I'm gonna try to

00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:41,489
differentiate between some of the hype

00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:44,700
and the reality so does that sound like

00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:46,890
a good idea okay so the topic is

00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:49,050
three-dimensional chess a game plan for

00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:52,140
digital experience success my name is

00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:54,899
Scott delay I've been fortunate enough

00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:57,390
to be in the digital marketing and

00:00:54,899 --> 00:01:00,090
Technology space for about 20 years in

00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:02,370
different roles most recently I was EVP

00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:04,409
of marketing for phase 2 and prior to

00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:06,570
that I've been in leadership roles and

00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:09,869
agencies one my own and another one I

00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:12,330
was president of a top 50 u.s. digital

00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:13,860
agency so I've seen a lot of really

00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:16,229
great projects for companies like

00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:18,600
PepsiCo and ADP and Prudential and

00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:19,380
Intuit and I've seen a lot of

00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:22,080
award-winning

00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:25,290
campaigns and I've also seen some epic

00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:27,360
failures because despite what people

00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:29,400
might let you think I mean things do go

00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:35,180
wrong sometimes especially when it comes

00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:37,920
to technology so here's some broad

00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:39,930
overarching trends that we've all seen

00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:43,159
one is that marketing is increasingly

00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:46,950
responsible for IT related projects

00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:48,600
secondly Gartner has stated whether you

00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:51,810
believe it or not that marketing

00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:54,180
actually has a larger IT budget than the

00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:55,979
CIO and they said they predicted that

00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:58,110
was gonna happen by 2017 and they

00:01:55,979 --> 00:02:02,399
reaffirmed it that yes it did happen a

00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:04,680
couple asterisks and this I do believe

00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:07,409
to be true is that mark tech now

00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:10,229
accounts for about a third of marketing

00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:12,480
budgets that's pretty significant now

00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:13,090
what that means to those of us in the

00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,620
room that are

00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:16,890
and by the way who who considers

00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:18,069
themselves in the marketing department

00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:20,500
okay

00:02:18,069 --> 00:02:22,599
just about everybody how many of you

00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:26,470
would also consider yourself a

00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:28,270
technologist Wow just about everybody so

00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:29,920
would you would it be safe to say that

00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:32,220
you kind of think of yourself as a mark

00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:36,489
tech professional just about everybody

00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:40,300
okay just almost everybody I consider

00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:41,860
myself the same you know I'm not I know

00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:43,900
a lot about marketing in business I know

00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:45,069
a little bit less about technology but

00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:48,400
what's really important is how you put

00:02:45,069 --> 00:02:51,069
the two of them together so in a world

00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:53,290
where today marketing has a large IT

00:02:51,069 --> 00:02:56,650
budget and many of our projects are

00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:58,420
dependent upon IT success it really

00:02:56,650 --> 00:03:00,099
means that we've got to step up our

00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:04,120
games when it comes to technology

00:03:00,099 --> 00:03:06,400
because this is what we're faced with so

00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:08,890
this is from the Standish group they

00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:13,209
published this report every year and

00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:16,750
this number hasn't changed much 71% of

00:03:13,209 --> 00:03:20,680
tech projects fail and some of them

00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:24,850
almost 1/3 fail epically in other words

00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:26,799
they never use what they built and we've

00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:28,870
heard of some of these whether it was

00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:31,510
you know government websites or a

00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:32,739
project that IBM worked on for state of

00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:34,299
Pennsylvania a hundred and thirty

00:03:32,739 --> 00:03:35,920
million dollar project that just went

00:03:34,299 --> 00:03:38,109
right down the tubes and never got

00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:40,090
launched these things happen I mean it's

00:03:38,109 --> 00:03:42,459
it's part of life but this is a pretty

00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:43,989
scary figure because if you're marketing

00:03:42,459 --> 00:03:45,430
and you're trying to you know really

00:03:43,989 --> 00:03:48,190
make an impact on your business

00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:50,560
you can't accept this number it's not

00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:52,209
gonna fly and when you're trying to get

00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,799
extra budget to create an amazing

00:03:52,209 --> 00:03:55,959
digital experience or a digital

00:03:53,799 --> 00:03:57,910
experience platform you can't go to the

00:03:55,959 --> 00:04:00,549
CFO and say hey we got about a 29%

00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:03,280
chance we're gonna succeed what do you

00:04:00,549 --> 00:04:06,069
say it doesn't fly that way so what I

00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:09,250
want to try to do is ascertain and

00:04:06,069 --> 00:04:14,370
highlight what are the best practices to

00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:17,049
help to make yourself part of that 29%

00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:18,850
so I'm gonna share with you three

00:04:17,049 --> 00:04:20,680
critical components of digital

00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:23,050
experience success some must-haves and

00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:24,099
best practices and at the end we're

00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:26,530
actually gonna take about 10 or 15

00:04:24,099 --> 00:04:28,300
minutes to do a self-evaluation

00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:31,510
this is really important you get a lot

00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:33,790
of content at events like this but I

00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:36,400
want to take a moment to actually say

00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:38,980
you know where do you rank do a

00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,240
self-evaluation try to determine you

00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:41,800
know what are the things I need to do

00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,630
the top two or three things I need to do

00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:45,010
when I leave here and I want us to at

00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:46,930
least go through the exercise together

00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:47,950
and then share some of that information

00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:50,290
with one another so it's a

00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:51,550
self-evaluation there's a safe space so

00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,780
you know if you don't like your score

00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:54,100
it's okay you don't have to share it but

00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:55,540
I do encourage you to at least go

00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:57,540
through the evaluation and then we'll

00:04:55,540 --> 00:05:00,460
share a couple best practices telic plan

00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:03,310
okay so first of all what is digital

00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:04,930
experience we hear a lot about it you

00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:06,820
know it's really sandwiched for me in

00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:09,160
between and it's a subset of customer

00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:10,750
experience and customer experience is

00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:13,960
generally defined as a holistic

00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:16,780
summation of every experience a customer

00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:20,169
has with a particular brand or a product

00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:23,350
and basically what their general

00:05:20,169 --> 00:05:26,260
impression is of it and sometimes that's

00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:28,630
expressed as a Net Promoter Score not

00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:30,729
it's one of the most frequent ways of

00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:32,890
measuring it but it's really how do you

00:05:30,729 --> 00:05:35,770
feel our end and are you gonna recommend

00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:37,770
that company or that brand across every

00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:40,630
touchpoint on every channel and

00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:43,330
increasingly in order to support that

00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:45,789
and digital experience is a subset of

00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:47,830
that you build out a digital experience

00:05:45,789 --> 00:05:53,500
platform so there's a lot of talk about

00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:57,100
DX P's and I would suggest that a DX P

00:05:53,500 --> 00:06:01,630
is more aspirational today we're really

00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:04,419
I would say is you know there isn't one

00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:08,800
company that can give you a DX P in most

00:06:04,419 --> 00:06:10,390
cases your DX P can be 2030 different

00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,880
disparate technologies that are gonna

00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:14,260
connect in some way it's not going to be

00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,210
one company providing all those

00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:17,800
technologies there is no such thing as

00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:20,740
one company that can give you all of

00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:23,380
this today and you're gonna be at a

00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:25,210
different stage of maturity on how far

00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:27,970
along you are with building out your DX

00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:30,370
P but I think it's important that at the

00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:31,780
very least we do have mark tech stacks

00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:33,910
so you do have a collection of

00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:35,740
technologies that helps to serve a great

00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:37,479
digital experience that serves a great

00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:38,890
customer experience so whatever that is

00:06:37,479 --> 00:06:39,760
you need to know what that is and where

00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:41,230
you're going with it

00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:43,090
talk about that a little bit more I

00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:46,690
would suggest though that because

00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:48,700
companies have to transform and they're

00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:49,990
trying to transform more digitally that

00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:51,820
when you're engaged with a customer

00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:53,770
experience project you're actually

00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:55,480
helping a company to digitally transform

00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:56,980
and that's a bit of the paradigm that

00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:58,510
I'd suggest that we need to take out of

00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:59,770
this is that we're not just putting in a

00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:01,120
technology to help with digital

00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:02,080
experience we're not just helping with

00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,970
digital experience we're helping a

00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:06,250
customer experience and it's really part

00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:07,660
of the digital transformation of the

00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:09,640
companies that we're working with and

00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:11,230
that's why sometimes it feels difficult

00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:12,820
to be doing what we're doing

00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:14,470
I mean sometimes it feels like you're on

00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:17,830
a cruise ship and you're with a paddle

00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:19,480
trying to move that thing and and that's

00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:22,390
partially because you're trying to

00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:24,130
digitally transform the company but one

00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:25,660
of my themes of this conversation and

00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:27,490
one of the things that I think that we

00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:29,920
need as an industry to pay more

00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:31,450
attention to is that don't get hung up

00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:32,950
in the technology or all these different

00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:34,630
acronyms at the end of the day what

00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:36,130
customers want is they don't want to be

00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:37,570
treated as an int they don't wanna be

00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:40,090
treated as a number they want to be

00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:42,070
treated as an individual they want it to

00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:44,380
be an authentic transparent experience

00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:46,840
and also suggested it for you to

00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:48,640
implement a program like this it has to

00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:50,380
be human and that's why at the end of

00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:52,570
the day it's not about digital

00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:54,790
experience to be successful at digital

00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:56,650
experience in your organization or to

00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:59,710
your customer it has to be a human

00:07:56,650 --> 00:08:01,180
experience so customer experience should

00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:02,410
really be human experience and you're

00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:05,050
successful and from the implementation

00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:07,360
has to be done with a human touch it's

00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:09,370
about really the people not to

00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,810
technology if you talk to anybody that's

00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:13,660
been through implementations like this

00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:15,340
you could have the worst technology but

00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:18,310
great people and somehow you get it done

00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:21,060
you could have the best technology but

00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:23,110
the worst people and it fails miserably

00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:26,890
so at the end of the day it comes down

00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:28,690
to the people leadership and not

00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:30,220
management if you woke up today and you

00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:31,990
think you're a manager you're not you

00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:34,169
need to be thinking like a leader if you

00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:37,210
want a project like this to succeed and

00:08:34,169 --> 00:08:39,700
lastly it's not just a project it's a

00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:41,590
transformation this is probably part of

00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:43,000
a multi-year effort for your company to

00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:44,860
change and for you to change the way

00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,920
that you market and interact with your

00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:50,530
customers so here's the three critical

00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:53,160
components not and as I just stated not

00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:55,900
all of them are equally important

00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:57,370
it's the typical people process

00:08:55,900 --> 00:09:00,640
technology but instead of people it's

00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:02,410
really the team that you build I'll talk

00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:04,510
about process and talk about technology

00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:06,880
so team wise these are the five key

00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:08,800
people I saw the last presentation there

00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,640
was that picture of the table the round

00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,960
table

00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:12,570
with the globe in the middle I think

00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:15,370
that's that's beautiful I think that's

00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:16,210
really a great representation of the

00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:17,860
number of people that need to be

00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:20,140
involved in a project this like this and

00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:21,790
the stakeholders but here's five key

00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:24,250
ones that I'd say you've got to get

00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:26,680
right first is the customer and I'll

00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:29,530
tell you how how to do that second is a

00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:31,810
great tech leader yourself and how you

00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:35,020
show up an executive sponsor and

00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:36,850
partners so a couple must-haves when it

00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:39,580
comes to your customer and evidence that

00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:42,400
you understand what's happening with

00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:44,740
your customer one is personas and the

00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:48,820
second is customer journeys customer

00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:50,470
journeys really are the backbone of your

00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:52,500
digital experience or your human

00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:54,790
experience program

00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:56,980
so here's how many people have personas

00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:59,620
right now of their customers okay

00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:01,990
probably about 90% you know they look

00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:06,240
something like this it's a little hard

00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:09,090
to see but this is Linda for example and

00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:11,680
Linda is pregnant with her first child

00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:14,140
so we have a narrative about her and

00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:15,790
what she's looking for a couple things

00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:17,440
on the bottom that I think are important

00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:21,220
are what is the initial trigger like

00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:22,930
what started this reason that she might

00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:25,120
need to find us in this case it's a

00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:27,160
health care provider and she found out

00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:29,590
she was pregnant that's critical for you

00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:31,870
to know as a marketer you need to

00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:34,030
understand what that's all at that point

00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:36,220
in time you also need to know her

00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:38,020
emotions and how she's feeling at that

00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:40,000
point in time some of the other

00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:42,040
attributes here are the devices she uses

00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,690
and definitely the media that she looks

00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:45,910
towards but it's really more of the

00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:48,100
human aspects of it the motive aspects

00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:50,560
that are gonna connect most with her and

00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:52,510
you take that that and you translate it

00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:55,180
into a customer journey and it might

00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:58,270
look something like this where you have

00:10:55,180 --> 00:11:01,600
the stages the lifecycle of Linda's

00:10:58,270 --> 00:11:04,210
journey to find an ob/gyn so awareness

00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,170
through to engagement on the left side

00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:07,389
you

00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:09,339
for those stages is that a positive and

00:11:07,389 --> 00:11:10,629
neutral or a negative experience so when

00:11:09,339 --> 00:11:13,540
she's ready to look she might go to a

00:11:10,629 --> 00:11:16,119
search engine and it mentions on the

00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:17,379
bottom some risk and opportunity so she

00:11:16,119 --> 00:11:19,899
doesn't have a lot of time and she's

00:11:17,379 --> 00:11:21,639
nervous about finding a new doctor now

00:11:19,899 --> 00:11:23,589
if you're providing content at that

00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:25,089
stage you got to be sensitive to that

00:11:23,589 --> 00:11:28,119
and you're gonna be way more effective

00:11:25,089 --> 00:11:30,669
if you provide content that is so in

00:11:28,119 --> 00:11:32,769
this case short form in this case a

00:11:30,669 --> 00:11:34,929
search engine ad you know something

00:11:32,769 --> 00:11:37,869
quick to the point sensitive with the

00:11:34,929 --> 00:11:39,309
right tone from a Content perspective so

00:11:37,869 --> 00:11:41,439
you follow the journey and you see where

00:11:39,309 --> 00:11:42,579
you've got opportunities and I think you

00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:44,319
know there could be twenty different

00:11:42,579 --> 00:11:46,839
touch points here there aren't in this

00:11:44,319 --> 00:11:49,149
case at least in this diagram but you

00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:50,619
look you prioritize and prioritize those

00:11:49,149 --> 00:11:52,540
touch points based upon the ones you

00:11:50,619 --> 00:11:56,649
have the greatest opportunity to delight

00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:58,569
or disappoint so take all the touch

00:11:56,649 --> 00:12:00,519
points prioritize them the 80/20 rule

00:11:58,569 --> 00:12:01,689
will apply there'll be 20 percent of

00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:04,209
those touch points they'll either

00:12:01,689 --> 00:12:07,299
disappoint or delight and you'll either

00:12:04,209 --> 00:12:09,999
own them or you'll lose them so don't

00:12:07,299 --> 00:12:13,239
don't get lost in the in the you know

00:12:09,999 --> 00:12:18,399
the 16 of those 20 that don't make the

00:12:13,239 --> 00:12:20,230
biggest impact now let's talk about you

00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:21,489
I think a lot of times in a conference

00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:23,290
like this we talk about the technology

00:12:21,489 --> 00:12:24,939
and we talk about process I want to talk

00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:27,579
about you the human aspect of this

00:12:24,939 --> 00:12:29,139
project and you have to I think we all

00:12:27,579 --> 00:12:32,139
have to ask ourselves so every day and

00:12:29,139 --> 00:12:33,730
are we leading or we managing and I can

00:12:32,139 --> 00:12:36,279
honestly say some days I'm waking up and

00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:40,149
I'm kind of managing there's other days

00:12:36,279 --> 00:12:42,160
that I'm truly leading and whatever role

00:12:40,149 --> 00:12:44,110
you play on your team you want to be

00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,850
waking up every day and leading whether

00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:48,279
you actually have your own team or not

00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:49,389
you're a part of a team and even if you

00:12:48,279 --> 00:12:51,399
have your own team and you have a

00:12:49,389 --> 00:12:53,470
project like this it's probably a matrix

00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:56,110
to team so you have to be thinking about

00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:57,429
how do I do team building how do I build

00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:58,509
up this team so that are working

00:12:57,429 --> 00:13:00,910
together they're not feeling like

00:12:58,509 --> 00:13:02,019
they're in silos and last part of this

00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:03,819
is take care of yourself

00:13:02,019 --> 00:13:06,009
I mean your team's gonna feed off the

00:13:03,819 --> 00:13:06,879
way you show up so how are you showing

00:13:06,009 --> 00:13:09,970
up every day

00:13:06,879 --> 00:13:12,730
are you unorganized are you frazzled are

00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:15,069
you reactive or are you honest and

00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:16,329
authentic and human are you letting

00:13:15,069 --> 00:13:17,949
people know hey it's gonna be a tough

00:13:16,329 --> 00:13:18,760
path the next two weeks this Sprint's

00:13:17,949 --> 00:13:21,970
gonna be rough

00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:23,740
or you know you're blowing smoke like

00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:25,329
how you show up how you take care

00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:27,250
yourself this will translate through

00:13:25,329 --> 00:13:29,760
your entire team and of all the

00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:31,720
stakeholders he or the five key people I

00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:33,639
don't know if there's anybody more

00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:36,699
important than yourself and in some of

00:13:33,639 --> 00:13:38,980
these characteristics so taking care of

00:13:36,699 --> 00:13:40,570
yourself can also mean you know I think

00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:42,220
some best practices are journaling I

00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:43,449
love the five minute journal I don't

00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:43,990
know if anybody uses that I think it's

00:13:43,449 --> 00:13:45,970
great

00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:49,480
of course meditation with headspace a

00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:52,120
poor calm eat right exercise all the

00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:53,260
basics but the team's gonna feed off you

00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:57,310
use to make sure you taking care of

00:13:53,260 --> 00:14:00,940
yourself other key stakeholders or team

00:13:57,310 --> 00:14:03,550
members your tech leader so you may be

00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:05,769
an expert in tech but you need somebody

00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:07,149
that sleeps eats and breezes you need to

00:14:05,769 --> 00:14:09,220
be able to go to this individual they

00:14:07,149 --> 00:14:11,199
need to have an opinion on your tech

00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:12,790
roadmap are you gonna be are you gonna

00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:14,829
go ahead list are you gonna go decoupled

00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:16,750
if we're gonna have 27 technologies

00:14:14,829 --> 00:14:18,459
talking to each other like which ones

00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:20,199
I'm you might not know which ones you

00:14:18,459 --> 00:14:22,510
need to talk to each other yet but

00:14:20,199 --> 00:14:24,610
what's our point of view on this like

00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:25,269
are we going open source or we not why

00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:27,310
or why not

00:14:25,269 --> 00:14:28,510
like this person needs to have a point

00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:30,459
of view and it needs to be not just

00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:33,040
about the technology but how it directly

00:14:30,459 --> 00:14:35,589
relates to the project success how is

00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,880
this gonna make us be more agile how are

00:14:35,589 --> 00:14:38,889
we going to serve our customers better

00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:40,449
create a more human experience they have

00:14:38,889 --> 00:14:41,829
to be able to translate that for you and

00:14:40,449 --> 00:14:44,800
you need to be able to count on them

00:14:41,829 --> 00:14:47,490
they need to show up so if you have a

00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:51,339
gap here you need to fill this an

00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:52,839
executive sponsor you know these are

00:14:51,339 --> 00:14:55,480
just one of the projects you have to

00:14:52,839 --> 00:14:58,209
have somebody that is not just watching

00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:59,889
your back but looking ahead to other

00:14:58,209 --> 00:15:01,029
departments because you're probably

00:14:59,889 --> 00:15:02,920
going to be interacting with other

00:15:01,029 --> 00:15:04,480
departments and so you need that

00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:06,250
executive sponsored you need to be

00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,470
totally aligned with that individual and

00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:10,060
most likely your goals are not going to

00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:12,610
just be did this project get done on

00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:14,709
time and at the right cost it's going to

00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:16,779
be did it improve our Net Promoter Score

00:15:14,709 --> 00:15:19,360
did it improve retention and acquisition

00:15:16,779 --> 00:15:21,310
and loyalty those are the type of

00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:23,050
metrics that you should have involved

00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:26,230
with this project and when you do your

00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:28,319
executive sponsor has to be at the table

00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:32,649
with you and walking side by side and

00:15:28,319 --> 00:15:34,360
then partners most of your here

00:15:32,649 --> 00:15:37,350
sure because you've selected Drupal and

00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:40,119
you know DXP doesn't stand for Drupal

00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:41,350
experience platform it's a digital

00:15:40,119 --> 00:15:42,670
experience platform there's maybe a lot

00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:46,180
of other technologies that you're gonna

00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:48,670
need to hook into this so you're buying

00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:52,179
into an ecosystem and it's really

00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:54,009
helpful when to select partners that

00:15:52,179 --> 00:15:55,269
work together it's like when you walk

00:15:54,009 --> 00:15:56,949
through the trade show floor you're

00:15:55,269 --> 00:15:59,170
deciding on technologies you're deciding

00:15:56,949 --> 00:16:01,089
on agencies see who works together

00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:02,410
already because I can tell you from

00:16:01,089 --> 00:16:04,449
real-life experience like they have a

00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:06,939
real vested interest in making you

00:16:04,449 --> 00:16:08,980
successful they will go above and beyond

00:16:06,939 --> 00:16:11,589
they will you'll get things done faster

00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:13,980
less expensively and ultimately a better

00:16:11,589 --> 00:16:15,939
solution if they already work together

00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:17,379
even if they don't have the integration

00:16:15,939 --> 00:16:19,569
done yet they're gonna have to integrate

00:16:17,379 --> 00:16:21,670
you want them to have a vested interest

00:16:19,569 --> 00:16:22,869
in doing that so you can save yourselves

00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:26,740
a lot of time and money by finding the

00:16:22,869 --> 00:16:28,420
right partners now I want to process so

00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:29,619
this is number two goes without saying

00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:31,480
but you have to have a project plan now

00:16:29,619 --> 00:16:34,059
people have project plans but they don't

00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:35,829
update them so if you haven't updated in

00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:38,470
the last two weeks you don't really have

00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:40,329
a project plan you have an old document

00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:42,179
if you're not living it so make sure

00:16:40,329 --> 00:16:44,649
that it's an updated project plan

00:16:42,179 --> 00:16:47,050
another critical part of process is

00:16:44,649 --> 00:16:49,269
continue with your team building that

00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:51,759
has to be something on your mind what am

00:16:49,269 --> 00:16:54,069
i doing to make this team more cohesive

00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:56,350
more productive more enrolled more

00:16:54,069 --> 00:16:58,329
fulfilled it's one of the things that

00:16:56,350 --> 00:17:00,069
I've seen recently is you see people do

00:16:58,329 --> 00:17:01,809
personality tests so we have the

00:17:00,069 --> 00:17:03,819
myers-briggs or others and I think

00:17:01,809 --> 00:17:05,980
that's a really good exercise for a team

00:17:03,819 --> 00:17:07,360
is to understand like where's everybody

00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:09,669
coming from what makes them different I

00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:11,709
think that tells you what their what

00:17:09,669 --> 00:17:13,059
their howl is and how they act

00:17:11,709 --> 00:17:15,339
it doesn't necessarily tell you what

00:17:13,059 --> 00:17:16,329
their Y is there's a company actually

00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:18,309
located here in Seattle called

00:17:16,329 --> 00:17:19,899
imperative and they they do an

00:17:18,309 --> 00:17:22,419
assessment to try to understand what

00:17:19,899 --> 00:17:24,370
people's purposes are what their Y's are

00:17:22,419 --> 00:17:26,679
and what their narrative is around that

00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:29,049
you share that with your team and then

00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:30,460
you do team counseling or team coaching

00:17:29,049 --> 00:17:32,799
and I find that to be a really

00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:34,990
interesting and effective way of team

00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:37,149
building so you might want to check that

00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:40,450
out and don't forget to recognize you

00:17:37,149 --> 00:17:42,460
know does anybody follow Gary Vee Gary

00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:44,350
Vaynerchuk couple people I mean he's

00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:45,909
great and he's blowing up LinkedIn right

00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:46,150
now you can't go on LinkedIn without

00:17:45,909 --> 00:17:48,460
getting

00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:51,130
million of his videos and you know he'll

00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:53,620
just randomly call one of his teammates

00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:54,910
and just be like you know hey thank you

00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:57,430
for everything that you're doing like

00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:59,470
just that random recognition goes a long

00:17:57,430 --> 00:18:00,490
way so make sure that you're acting like

00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:03,180
a leader and you're providing that

00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:06,940
recognition formally and informally

00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:09,730
aligned business goals so over 2,000

00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:12,760
people were asked what makes digital

00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:14,380
transformation efforts fail and the one

00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:16,300
of the number one reasons was a lack of

00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:20,170
communication and a lack of alignment on

00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:22,810
business goals so your entire team

00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:25,210
should understand what the goals of this

00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:27,790
project are whether it's a net promoter

00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:30,460
score or a lifetime value if you're

00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:32,170
using the EOS methodology a great book

00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:34,060
by Gina Whitman called

00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:36,490
traction it's a great methodology for

00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:39,460
managing companies and teams you might

00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:41,620
call it a rock or okay ours are very

00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:43,420
popular these days but make sure you've

00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:44,860
identified the goals your executive

00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:46,750
stakeholder can help make sure your

00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:50,380
entire team knows and those goals are

00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:52,900
known across and down the organization

00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:55,120
and give regular reporting so it's part

00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:56,730
of your updated project plan talk about

00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:59,440
how you're doing relative to the goals

00:18:56,730 --> 00:19:01,540
so if you've implemented certain aspects

00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,890
of this platform how are you doing is

00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:05,530
there Net Promoter Score going up going

00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:07,390
down your team needs to be thinking

00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:08,710
about that not just whether they you

00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:12,040
know successfully completed the next

00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:14,110
sprint and don't forget your executive

00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:16,600
sponsor meetings these are easy to get

00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:18,190
cancelled don't do it you should be

00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:20,620
speaking with this sponsor every couple

00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:22,960
weeks you will need them so make sure

00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:24,190
it's on your calendar and that you get

00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,440
to that meeting and you're not just

00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:28,720
talking about you know the latest you

00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:30,640
know Game of Thrones episode like that's

00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,290
important but also talk about like

00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:37,920
houses project doing relative to the

00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:37,920
goals that you set make sense okay

00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:43,150
lastly lastly technology because

00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:45,190
actually it's not as important as the

00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:47,350
other component I'm going to show you a

00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:50,230
great way to take a look at your

00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:52,800
information architecture select open

00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:55,000
technologies and a tech mop tech map

00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:57,730
roadmap rather

00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:00,100
this is an exercise that aqua goes

00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:02,980
through that I think is just fantastic

00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:04,750
and the feedback that I've heard from

00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:06,039
people implementing programs like this

00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:08,470
is that they have to know what they

00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:10,900
currently have and this is a great way

00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:15,190
to go about doing it so it's basically

00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:17,440
an ia of a Mar tech stack and you would

00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:23,169
take your logos and you just plot them

00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:24,460
to you what your current state is what

00:20:23,169 --> 00:20:26,679
people will tell you is that when they

00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:28,720
do this exercise there are black holes

00:20:26,679 --> 00:20:31,750
all over this there are areas that they

00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:35,590
have no idea what technologies are being

00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:37,390
used and then the next thing is it's

00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:38,860
like who owns that technology like who

00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:41,280
makes the decision on that technology

00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:43,450
it's the next really important question

00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:45,400
so this is enlightening and this will

00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:49,000
take you some time but you have to have

00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:50,200
this done you have to have to do it you

00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,030
will have people come up to me be like

00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:53,350
wow I had no idea we had that technology

00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:55,600
or I'd no idea we didn't have that

00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:56,950
technology and you'll have gaps on who

00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,780
actually owns it and you'll have to go

00:20:56,950 --> 00:21:00,429
find out who owns it and you'll find

00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:01,900
that people are actually having to make

00:21:00,429 --> 00:21:03,880
decisions that they do own it or don't

00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:06,159
own it without this it's going to be

00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:08,039
very difficult to navigate the matrix

00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:10,510
organizations that you're probably in

00:21:08,039 --> 00:21:12,039
this is a beautiful way of looking at

00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:14,169
right so when you get really advanced to

00:21:12,039 --> 00:21:16,659
this you've done with your your DXP ia

00:21:14,169 --> 00:21:19,539
and you can submit it for a stack e this

00:21:16,659 --> 00:21:22,900
is one by paychecks paychecks is a is

00:21:19,539 --> 00:21:25,360
actually a Drupal customer so they use

00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:26,980
Drupal and they submitted and they won

00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,330
for the stachy Awards I won't go into

00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:32,890
detail in this but you can find this on

00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:34,030
chief Mar tech comm once you start

00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:35,620
getting advanced and you have your

00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:37,240
customer journeys and you have all these

00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:39,789
disparate technologies you're gonna want

00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:42,130
to orchestrate those customer journeys

00:21:39,789 --> 00:21:43,929
and analyze how customers are going

00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:45,340
through those journeys in a

00:21:43,929 --> 00:21:47,669
cross-channel fashion and there's some

00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:50,530
really great new technologies out there

00:21:47,669 --> 00:21:52,840
such as aqueous journey product there's

00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:55,240
others out there as well and it allows

00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:56,740
you in real time to plot the customer

00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:58,539
journey and annal and see where

00:21:56,740 --> 00:22:01,330
customers are falling along that

00:21:58,539 --> 00:22:02,160
workflow and then do a/b testing along

00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:04,680
the way

00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:06,450
so a really great advanced technology

00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:10,110
it's still in the early stages it will

00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:14,120
be a standard set of your mark tech

00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:16,710
stack in the future if it's not already

00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:19,140
open technologies

00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:21,090
you know there's give me 27 technologies

00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:22,890
you might integrate you need them to be

00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:24,870
open you can't have these walled gardens

00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:27,120
with proprietary technologies that

00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:28,950
either don't have api's or you can't get

00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:30,900
at the data you have to be able to get

00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:33,420
into today into the data so make sure

00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:35,970
that your technology adviser is making

00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:37,920
is vetting those technologies to make

00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:39,570
sure they're open and just because

00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:41,370
something is open-source by the way does

00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:43,290
not mean that it's an open technology

00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:44,930
that you can readily share information

00:22:43,290 --> 00:22:47,820
so you'd have to look at that separately

00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:50,970
and a technology roadmap this is gonna

00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:53,040
be a multi-year process so let people

00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:54,630
know what the horizon looks like and

00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:56,040
what the stages are even if you don't

00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:58,620
know the technologies that you're gonna

00:22:56,040 --> 00:23:00,750
use yet it's helpful for them to know

00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:02,790
like oh you're planning on putting a dam

00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:05,100
in place in 18 months

00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:07,230
okay that's great I know that the dams

00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:09,690
coming in 18 months or I know that the

00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:11,280
CDP customer Data Platform we're not

00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:12,660
thinking about that for two years okay

00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:15,570
cool I get it

00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:17,640
so having a plan and give them

00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:19,820
visibility of your team is is something

00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:23,850
that's really helpful okay

00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:26,250
self-evaluation time ready to rock Wow

00:23:23,850 --> 00:23:29,040
come on are you ready to go let's do it

00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:30,330
so if you have you're gonna have to keep

00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,710
score so I'm gonna give you some of

00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:33,660
these points you're gonna get points

00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:35,190
you're gonna give yourself points and

00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:36,240
then we're just gonna compare the

00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:41,550
numbers that we come up with

00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:45,030
so first is your team and that's 50% is

00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:47,490
a hundred points total that's 50% of the

00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:50,310
overall numbers that you can the score

00:23:47,490 --> 00:23:51,510
that you can get so give yourself ten

00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:54,440
points if you're leading

00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:57,570
you're always leading versus managing

00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:59,610
you give yourself you know five points

00:23:57,570 --> 00:24:02,190
you kind of 50/50 somewhere in between

00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:04,500
if you have your primary customer

00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:07,650
personas and journey Maps completed give

00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:12,720
yourself ten points do you have a strong

00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:14,190
tech lead ten not so strong maybe a five

00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:16,619
you know give yourself the number of

00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:18,330
points that you want in there have you

00:24:16,619 --> 00:24:19,409
identified your key partners they're

00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:22,979
gonna help you with this effort whether

00:24:19,409 --> 00:24:25,440
technology partners or agencies and do

00:24:22,979 --> 00:24:27,889
you have an executive sponsor identified

00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:33,690
and I'm bored with this effort

00:24:27,889 --> 00:24:35,369
okay we'll add those up okay

00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:39,389
everyone have theirs added up so how

00:24:35,369 --> 00:24:41,580
many people you know a guy like 25

00:24:39,389 --> 00:24:48,960
points or less and be as honest as you

00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:53,700
can okay how many people 25 to 35 and

00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:54,359
how many folks 35 to 50 okay so most

00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:59,119
were in the middle

00:24:54,359 --> 00:25:02,729
so AC score on this category is a 27

00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:04,499
just a benchmark where you are okay

00:25:02,729 --> 00:25:07,139
next keep that score handy because we're

00:25:04,499 --> 00:25:10,080
gonna add these all up process do you

00:25:07,139 --> 00:25:11,249
have an updated project plan that means

00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,659
that it's been updated in the last two

00:25:11,249 --> 00:25:16,470
weeks

00:25:11,659 --> 00:25:18,210
yes or no five points or zero regular

00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:22,019
team building are you thinking about

00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:23,279
that for example you know one of my

00:25:22,019 --> 00:25:26,639
former colleagues

00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:28,710
Nicole Lind she to keep healthy and the

00:25:26,639 --> 00:25:31,379
build team did a Fitbit challenge and

00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:32,970
she created a group where they would

00:25:31,379 --> 00:25:35,849
count their steps and compete for prizes

00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:36,330
and that you know that worked out really

00:25:35,849 --> 00:25:37,950
well

00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:42,299
there's other opportunities for you to

00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:43,499
go do MS K's cycle for survival and do

00:25:42,299 --> 00:25:45,179
that as a team so volunteer

00:25:43,499 --> 00:25:46,499
opportunities a great way it doesn't

00:25:45,179 --> 00:25:48,989
just have to be happy hour so you can be

00:25:46,499 --> 00:25:50,999
healthy and have fun and build team so

00:25:48,989 --> 00:25:52,379
regular team building activities if you

00:25:50,999 --> 00:25:53,970
have a line to business goals give

00:25:52,379 --> 00:25:56,309
yourself 10 points and do you meet with

00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:59,099
your executive sponsor at least every

00:25:56,309 --> 00:26:04,499
two weeks all right add those up how

00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:08,879
many people ten or less points okay how

00:26:04,499 --> 00:26:11,039
many folks from ten to twenty most

00:26:08,879 --> 00:26:15,649
people in there and how many folks 20 or

00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:15,649
higher okay

00:26:17,799 --> 00:26:25,220
last one technology if you have an

00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:26,450
updated DXP information architecture or

00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:28,760
mark tech ia

00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:31,039
give yourself five points you've chosen

00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:33,860
to open technologies it's gonna be

00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:35,570
important to give yourself ten and then

00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:37,460
do you have a technology roadmap meaning

00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:39,169
just do you see the technology is gonna

00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:40,730
be rolling out at least for the next

00:26:39,169 --> 00:26:43,520
year and I'd recommend you want to start

00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:48,110
looking towards two years to three years

00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:57,200
out as well okay up to ten ten points or

00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:58,700
less ten to 20 and 21 to 25 okay

00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:00,950
so it sounds like on this piece that

00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:03,470
we're a little bit more people were kind

00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:05,000
of less than ten actually the bulk so we

00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:09,440
have a little bit of work to do on that

00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:12,220
part of it questions on this I'll stop

00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,220
for a moment while we

00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:19,920
so I'm gonna I'm gonna leave you with

00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:22,110
this thought and that you know this

00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:24,900
session was all about how to create a

00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:26,370
great digital experience but hopefully

00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:28,260
in some way I've impressed upon you that

00:27:26,370 --> 00:27:32,280
it's really not about the digital

00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:33,840
experience we are here to serve human

00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:35,610
beings they want to be treated like

00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:39,030
human beings and that goes for not only

00:27:35,610 --> 00:27:42,540
our customers but also the people that

00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:44,090
we're looking to lead on our teams so

00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:46,350
with that I want to thank all of you and

00:27:44,090 --> 00:27:47,790
if I can answer any questions at any

00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:50,130
point please let me know I'd love to

00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:52,380
connect with you on LinkedIn if you have

00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:52,590
suggestions love to hear from you as
