Description: 
	Your website’s data is at risk, but knowing how to protect it can mean the difference between another day in the office and a data breach. By building in encryption from the beginning stages of your site, you will avoid headaches from having to bolt it on after the fact and have more tools at your disposal to keep your users secure.
