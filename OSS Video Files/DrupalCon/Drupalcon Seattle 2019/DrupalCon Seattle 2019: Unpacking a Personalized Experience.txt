Title: DrupalCon Seattle 2019: Unpacking a Personalized Experience
Publication date: 2019-04-11
Playlist: Drupalcon Seattle 2019
Description: 
	When it comes to personalization, everyone always talks about the end result -- what a customer saw or experienced that ultimately got them to convert. But what we don't focus on enough is all the pieces it takes to actually get there. Let's peel back the layers and step through what it takes to deliver just one personalized experience, from operator to end user.

Spoiler alert: in our presentation, you’ll learn that successful personalization cannot be accomplished without first putting the right process in place for your business. We’ll give you a framework, use cases, and best practices to take back to your teams and tackle your next personalization request head-on.

you get a chance to eat I wanted to talk

00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:28,050
first about the firsts of this week so

00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:30,170
there's this is a week of firsts myself

00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:33,750
it is my first DrupalCon

00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:36,270
Adriana how many Drupal cons seven

00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:40,079
Rubicon's it is both of our first times

00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:41,820
in Seattle it's our first time actually

00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:43,920
presenting and sharing the story that we

00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:46,100
built and worked on with you and it's

00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:49,579
our first time co-presenting together

00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:55,260
but most importantly of all that

00:00:49,579 --> 00:00:59,910
yesterday was Adriana's first oyster and

00:00:55,260 --> 00:01:02,250
her first raw seafood so of all the

00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:04,220
takeaways from this week it's it's been

00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:06,119
a week it's been a good week of firsts

00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:08,130
so today we're gonna talk a little bit

00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:10,950
about personalization unpacking a

00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:12,420
personalized experience and and I'm

00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:13,650
gonna kind of start off with talking

00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:16,259
about a lot of some of the high-level

00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:17,820
stuff and then the best part of the

00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:19,470
presentation is the back half when

00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:21,960
Adriana gets to explain all the amazing

00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:24,180
work that she and her team did to make

00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:25,320
this a reality and one of the things we

00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:26,369
see you know Adriana has been to many

00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:29,250
conferences I've been to many

00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:30,479
conferences and especially when it comes

00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:32,270
to things like strap like

00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:35,329
personalization and customer experience

00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:37,890
they tend to be very focused around

00:01:35,329 --> 00:01:40,079
strategy and you know high-level things

00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:42,720
so we wanted to do kind of the exact

00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:44,640
opposite we've implemented and built a

00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:47,310
personalization practice in Acquia and

00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,110
we get to share all the stuff that we

00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:51,030
did with you so hopefully you'll have

00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:53,430
some takeaways and some some learnings

00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:57,180
and well of course let's get started

00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:58,619
let's let's unpack it so a lot of times

00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:00,600
I've seen this is like our mandate the

00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:02,250
things that we had to do but fortunately

00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:04,469
for us we have really great bosses who

00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:07,170
actually care about us and to care about

00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:09,360
being successful and we were able to not

00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:10,890
just think about what we had to do or

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,170
what we were told to do but what we

00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:14,760
cared about and there's a

00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:17,340
couple things that we really cared about

00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:18,750
in this process and I actually don't

00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:22,500
think I'm the best person to talk about

00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:23,790
number one Drupal first and everything

00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,830
we do that's you know the backbone of

00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:28,500
our business it's the heart of how we

00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:30,209
build content experiences it's you know

00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:32,220
that's where we got our start and it's

00:02:30,209 --> 00:02:34,680
where we'll have you know whatever you

00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:35,760
know the next phase is for aqueous but

00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:38,430
making sure that we were leveraging

00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:40,230
tools and technology that were ours but

00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:41,700
also that were integrated with the way

00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:43,980
that we were building experiences today

00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:46,019
and that was through being Drupal first

00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:48,630
of course we want to use our own tools

00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:50,130
we want to use our own technology we

00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:51,269
want to make sure that we're using all

00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:55,380
of the things that we're sharing with

00:02:51,269 --> 00:02:57,060
our customers after the first after this

00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:59,430
presentation the first class will be on

00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:01,470
me all right so we also needed to prove

00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:03,180
this out to our bosses and our at the

00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:04,319
folks in our team we needed to do things

00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:05,850
that they were going to say this is

00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:07,680
worth the investment in the time that

00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:10,049
you're making so for that improving the

00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,910
site experience and increasing site

00:03:10,049 --> 00:03:14,580
metrics was really important to us and

00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:15,959
then customer acquisition of course was

00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:17,970
really important as well right so we're

00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:20,299
a b2b company or product company we want

00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:23,040
to try and move folks down that funnel

00:03:20,299 --> 00:03:24,989
we also want to be a use case for our

00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,910
customers we want to share yes of course

00:03:24,989 --> 00:03:28,500
all the awesome stuff we did but really

00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:30,510
importantly from a strategic perspective

00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:32,310
we want to share all of the things that

00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:34,200
we learned and maybe the things that we

00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:36,480
didn't dos do so well so that our

00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:41,130
customers can not make those same

00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:42,510
decisions and a lot of times we think

00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:44,100
that this starts with technology I

00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:45,750
really think it starts with people right

00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:48,390
finding the right people and and

00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:49,859
identifying the right stakeholders so

00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:51,870
two of the three of us are on stage

00:03:49,859 --> 00:03:53,190
today myself I'm on the product

00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:55,230
marketing side of the house Eric

00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:58,910
Fullerton and I was able to do things

00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:58,910
like strategize and think of use cases

00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:07,739
[Music]

00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:10,079
and Prasanna Kulkarni who's our web

00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:12,600
analytics manager who's holding down the

00:04:10,079 --> 00:04:14,910
fort back in Boston was someone who's

00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,930
able to analyze the results and get

00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:18,380
things back to us we were trying to

00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:20,970
understand a lot of what we were doing

00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:22,950
so I want to talk a little bit about our

00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:24,900
approach and how we went and thought

00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:26,410
about what we're trying to do because

00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:28,360
this stuff is

00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:30,580
that easy right there's there's a lot of

00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:31,930
process associated with this and we need

00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:33,430
to be really thoughtful about if you're

00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:35,230
actually going to do personalization you

00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:36,880
have to you kind of have to do it right

00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:40,690
so I want to talk a little bit about our

00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:42,190
approach before I kind of do that though

00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:44,410
is anyone here

00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:46,530
I like a puzzle expert anyone here make

00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:49,240
the puzzles anyone good at puzzles

00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:52,870
so come on someone's got to be good

00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:55,090
there we go all right I am NOT I learned

00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:57,340
this because I did a 750 piece puzzle a

00:04:55,090 --> 00:05:00,040
couple weeks ago and I learned a lot

00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:03,010
about myself and specifically my spatial

00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:04,870
recognition skills but when when you

00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:09,400
build a puzzle what's the what's the

00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:13,780
first thing that you do the edges and

00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:16,570
why do we why do we think that is it's

00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:18,670
the like the easiest part that's the

00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:21,070
easiest part so when you start doing

00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:23,020
something and for us this is that we

00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:24,280
took this to heart where when you start

00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:25,780
doing something you have to start with

00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:27,760
the easy things the things you can do

00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:29,140
today so when we talk about you know

00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:32,680
building this practice we thought about

00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:34,290
crawl walk run so for us crawl doing

00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:36,700
things with you know maybe lower effort

00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:38,710
faster results something we could build

00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:41,050
and iterate on and measure content we

00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:42,460
already had data we already had that was

00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:44,440
really where we wanted to focus and by

00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:47,470
setting those edge pieces we were

00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:48,730
actually able to move into the walk face

00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:50,830
we're gonna actually take you through

00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:52,630
where we where we've built and a lot of

00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:54,310
the things that we've done but then

00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:56,050
things that require more content and

00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:58,300
more data and more effort and more time

00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:59,590
and then really excitingly a lot of the

00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:01,810
things we're implementing and doing

00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:03,960
right now to really think about the run

00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:06,910
of multiple different pieces of content

00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:08,140
personalization and then of course you

00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:11,680
know that that omni-channel experience

00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:13,270
bringing in web and social and mobile

00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:19,990
applications into the into the

00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:22,150
experience for us all right so get the

00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:23,230
data the crawl phase is important

00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:24,670
because you get to do a couple things

00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:25,870
but you really want to get the data you

00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:28,720
really want to understand who's coming

00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:30,220
to your site beyond just clicks so that

00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,840
was really important and I want to talk

00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:34,300
through a little bit of the process of

00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:36,460
how we did that and I promise that I'm

00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:38,169
almost done and Adriana is gonna show

00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:39,190
you all the cool stuff in a second but

00:06:38,169 --> 00:06:40,180
it's really important to think about

00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:42,130
these things from

00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:43,810
you know a baseline behavior activity

00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:45,940
and behavioral type of way so there's

00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:47,350
three types of data that we are trying

00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:49,060
to collect and trying to understand

00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:50,560
about our users the first thing is the

00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:52,330
baseline right the stuff we can get from

00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,520
anyone at anytime as soon as they touch

00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:56,650
our site the next is the activity so

00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:58,509
across multiple sessions the things that

00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:59,979
they did and starting to actually build

00:06:58,509 --> 00:07:01,810
that into their profiles so we can

00:06:59,979 --> 00:07:03,699
actually deliver a relevant experience

00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:04,900
to them and then our last step is the

00:07:03,699 --> 00:07:06,400
behavioral piece which is when we

00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:08,979
actually start to make some inferences

00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:11,009
from the actions and activities and

00:07:08,979 --> 00:07:13,090
baseline information that we collected

00:07:11,009 --> 00:07:15,310
so I'm gonna go through these a little

00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:18,009
bit in just just some specific examples

00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:19,509
but Adrian is actually gonna talk about

00:07:18,009 --> 00:07:22,270
the ones that were most important to us

00:07:19,509 --> 00:07:24,310
but find on first touch anytime someone

00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:25,690
visits your site this is information

00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:27,070
that's gonna be available to you you

00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:28,630
know what device they're on you know

00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:30,310
what operating systems on you know their

00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:31,389
geolocation you know if this is their

00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:33,160
first time on the site or if they've

00:07:31,389 --> 00:07:34,780
been there before you know maybe with

00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:36,460
time in the date that they visited and

00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:38,169
of course you know where they came from

00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:39,580
so we're able to collect an unbelievable

00:07:38,169 --> 00:07:41,110
amount of information just from the

00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:42,610
first touch that you can actually start

00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:44,889
actioning and doing personalizations on

00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:49,570
and from this baseline data geolocation

00:07:44,889 --> 00:07:51,370
was the most important and then activity

00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:52,810
is the next level in sight so this is

00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:54,490
probably going to come across multiple

00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:56,199
different sessions right so multiple

00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:58,360
different experiences with your site so

00:07:56,199 --> 00:07:59,650
things like what pages did they view in

00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:01,180
maybe it's how much time they spend

00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:02,500
whether they visited this page or that

00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:05,020
page whether they clicked on this

00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:06,310
content downloaded this asset and then

00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:08,020
we're consistently building that into

00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:09,430
the baseline data that we've got so

00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:18,099
we're starting to understand a little

00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:19,360
bit about what these people like so

00:08:18,099 --> 00:08:20,500
that's how we were starting to build out

00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,479
things that we were really thinking

00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:24,220
about and then the last thing is really

00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:26,620
starting to kind of make some inferences

00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:28,720
or assumptions which is something like

00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:30,940
the what stage of the funnel are they in

00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32,440
what's their preferred content right

00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:34,270
what types of content are they engaging

00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:35,469
with and then what is there maybe we can

00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:37,390
even do something like their favorite

00:08:35,469 --> 00:08:39,159
product one of the best things when I

00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:41,469
would I talked to our web analytics

00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:42,729
manager PK and I said what's the coolest

00:08:41,469 --> 00:08:44,050
thing we were able to understand about

00:08:42,729 --> 00:08:46,270
the visitors that are coming to our site

00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:47,950
we're a b2b business and he said I know

00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:49,959
everyone's favorite product who comes to

00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:51,170
the site and I said that is way better

00:08:49,959 --> 00:08:53,720
answer than I was

00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:55,730
for that's fantastic that's awesome

00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:57,050
maybe their visitor biotype or we know

00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:58,790
what their preferred channel is and

00:08:57,050 --> 00:09:01,130
we're constantly building this over time

00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:12,079
so this is a data collection pieces of

00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:14,510
crawl walk run exercise as well the last

00:09:12,079 --> 00:09:16,790
the one last thing that I'll talk about

00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:18,589
before we get to the good stuff is it's

00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:20,589
it's a very natural thought to say like

00:09:18,589 --> 00:09:22,639
I'm going to do personalization now and

00:09:20,589 --> 00:09:24,110
because I'm doing personalization now

00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:28,310
I'm going to create all this new awesome

00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:31,010
great content for personalization don't

00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:32,029
do that because it takes a long time to

00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:33,560
build content right it's really

00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:35,180
challenging there's a lot of different

00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:37,760
processes and workflows that take to

00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:40,220
take place but you have a lot of content

00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:42,019
we had a lot of content that we could

00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:43,279
work from immediately out of the gate

00:09:42,019 --> 00:09:44,720
and adriana is going to go through a

00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:46,190
little bit about you know what types of

00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:55,670
content and what types of decisions that

00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:57,980
we made so now so how he did it so we

00:09:55,670 --> 00:10:01,699
took a step back and we said okay let's

00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:03,920
start off with the integrations so in

00:10:01,699 --> 00:10:05,420
order to get that baseline of data right

00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:07,579
you're not starting off with just a

00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:09,470
fresh clean slate you're integrating

00:10:07,579 --> 00:10:11,060
your Google Analytics which a lot of

00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:12,920
companies start off with from day one

00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:14,449
and then you also have your marketing

00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:16,760
automation for us Marketo

00:10:14,449 --> 00:10:18,649
and then we have Domo which visualizes

00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:20,839
all this data we pull it all together so

00:10:18,649 --> 00:10:23,089
we really integrated all the systems so

00:10:20,839 --> 00:10:24,829
that we could gather data for a four to

00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:26,720
six month period so that we're not

00:10:24,829 --> 00:10:28,760
starting off from with a blank slate and

00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:32,870
we're taking the data that we already

00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:35,690
have and pulling it all together to make

00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:37,040
better decisions and to also take what

00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:38,810
people already have interacted with

00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,640
those touch points that they have and

00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:45,050
then make decisions based off of that

00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:47,180
data so we'll go into a crawl State

00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:49,730
right so we start off with this data

00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:52,910
right and we take a look at personas in

00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:56,120
our location so that geolocation our

00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:58,339
most important piece and we say okay we

00:10:56,120 --> 00:11:00,170
have marketers we have developers and we

00:10:58,339 --> 00:11:01,670
have operators and then we have

00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:04,370
different locations where our business

00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:04,970
operates right across the globe and then

00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:06,649
we take our

00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:09,980
content that we already have not

00:11:06,649 --> 00:11:14,149
recreating the wheel and we tagged that

00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:16,490
content so we go into Drupal we use

00:11:14,149 --> 00:11:18,800
taxonomy turns and we tag our content so

00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:21,709
we have our marketer our operator and

00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:23,959
our developer here and we go in and we

00:11:21,709 --> 00:11:25,879
tag all our content so lots of you guys

00:11:23,959 --> 00:11:27,699
how many you guys tag your content right

00:11:25,879 --> 00:11:30,920
now we'll talk to on taxonomy terms

00:11:27,699 --> 00:11:32,389
right so you take that tagging and

00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:35,029
that's what you use for your

00:11:32,389 --> 00:11:36,949
personalization right so you come in

00:11:35,029 --> 00:11:38,870
here we have a piece of content we're

00:11:36,949 --> 00:11:42,110
going to tag it so that we can pull that

00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:45,350
in to our tool and utilize that to make

00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:47,660
decisions so I'm gonna go through a use

00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:49,850
case we took a step back and we said we

00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:51,949
have all this content let's look at the

00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:55,850
lone hanging fruit first we have blogs

00:11:51,949 --> 00:11:57,620
regular cadence of it a large amount of

00:11:55,850 --> 00:12:01,399
content that gets good interaction on

00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:04,000
different channels and we said okay we

00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:07,129
have a blog written by the man himself

00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,050
on personalization and so we'll start

00:12:07,129 --> 00:12:11,389
off with that and you have really two

00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:13,250
different pieces of personalization you

00:12:11,389 --> 00:12:15,439
have in context and then you have

00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:16,670
returning so everybody when they're

00:12:15,439 --> 00:12:19,040
coming on their side they had their

00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:22,040
first touches and you want to say okay

00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:24,019
what what content can I serve them up so

00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:27,319
they're looking at a particular blog and

00:12:24,019 --> 00:12:30,259
you give them on the left hand side this

00:12:27,319 --> 00:12:32,629
in session personalization that blog is

00:12:30,259 --> 00:12:34,730
based off of personalization and we have

00:12:32,629 --> 00:12:36,559
related content pieces for them to

00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:40,519
continue reading keeping them on that

00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:42,769
journey right well they end up leaving

00:12:40,519 --> 00:12:45,050
our site unfortunately and they end up

00:12:42,769 --> 00:12:47,480
coming back one day later and they're

00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:49,579
returning visitor now well now on

00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:51,439
several areas of our site not just on

00:12:49,579 --> 00:12:54,559
the blog but maybe on the home page or a

00:12:51,439 --> 00:12:58,339
product page and we now show them a

00:12:54,559 --> 00:13:00,290
different set of content that is more

00:12:58,339 --> 00:13:01,790
applicable maybe or maybe can get them

00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:03,649
to actually interact with us and stay

00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:04,670
with us longer so that's what you're

00:13:03,649 --> 00:13:09,129
seeing here those two different

00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:13,009
strategies so then we start walking and

00:13:09,129 --> 00:13:16,790
we take that next step further so we say

00:13:13,009 --> 00:13:18,320
okay what can we do here well we're

00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:21,110
gonna do some condition

00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:23,990
grouping and so we're gonna take we have

00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:25,220
our personas and we have our locations

00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:27,080
and we're gonna start to group them so

00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:29,450
we had some IT personnel that are in the

00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:32,720
US and we have some marketers that are

00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:34,400
maybe in the UK or Australia and all of

00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,320
them want to see different types of

00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:38,060
content and across the globe

00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:40,730
we're all at different stages of

00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:42,680
implementing that tack right so people

00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:46,190
that are in the u.s. may be at one stage

00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:47,900
but people may be in Asia or Europe may

00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:51,110
be at a different stage right so we're

00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:55,340
gonna start to group those then we

00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:57,230
decided to do a use case with I just

00:13:55,340 --> 00:14:00,200
want to do a quick like overview of what

00:13:57,230 --> 00:14:02,030
the report actually is and so we built

00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:03,980
this really amazing report closing the

00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:05,720
CX gap it's the trends report about a

00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:07,400
lot of the interesting things and trends

00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:09,440
are going around customs going on around

00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:11,720
customer experience so we're building

00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:14,240
out about leadership because of all the

00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:16,190
you know work that you know we mostly

00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,990
Adriana were able to do at the initial

00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:20,120
stage and actually prove out the value

00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:22,730
when we took this whole campaign that we

00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:24,620
were doing from analysts and social web

00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:25,850
you know digital email like all the

00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:26,990
different things we were doing we were

00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:28,940
actually able to put you know

00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:31,220
personalization as a component of

00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:33,290
delivering that report so being able to

00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:35,030
do it initially prove it out and then

00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:36,710
say we can actually do this we're gonna

00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:38,570
improve the experience get the right

00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:39,500
people the right content for this report

00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:40,790
was really important because this

00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:42,560
reports you know a really big deal for

00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:45,530
us and in our campaigns over the next

00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:48,680
couple months so when we initially

00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:52,880
launched this campaign we had a single

00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:55,420
landing page global report strictly on a

00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:57,680
more broader audience you know this

00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:59,930
overarching data you know you can

00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:01,880
download our report it has all the data

00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:04,820
in it but when you first come to the

00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:08,260
page or like I want to see what I want

00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:11,630
to see no not the global stuff right so

00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:13,490
we personalize this page and what you

00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:15,230
can see here is this is just one step of

00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:17,420
it at the top of the page it says get

00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:19,070
the report right so when they click on

00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:21,920
it somebody from the UK and you can see

00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:24,260
in the you know URL here instead of

00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:26,630
displaying them the global report when

00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:28,850
they click on it they're now seeing the

00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:31,419
UK report or the Australia

00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:33,999
or you know one of the other regions

00:15:31,419 --> 00:15:36,769
then we get further down the page okay

00:15:33,999 --> 00:15:38,779
and we start to get into this global

00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:40,970
aspect right and a lot of us are

00:15:38,779 --> 00:15:42,649
thinking okay we need to personalize our

00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:44,899
content for the global regions and

00:15:42,649 --> 00:15:47,179
sometimes that's translated and yeah we

00:15:44,899 --> 00:15:49,189
have to think about that too so you can

00:15:47,179 --> 00:15:51,379
see here that we have the global report

00:15:49,189 --> 00:15:53,629
on the top left right and you have your

00:15:51,379 --> 00:15:56,209
French region on the right and you have

00:15:53,629 --> 00:15:58,609
your UK marketers at the bottom and you

00:15:56,209 --> 00:16:01,639
can see that the stats are all different

00:15:58,609 --> 00:16:03,229
and the content is all different but

00:16:01,639 --> 00:16:05,600
when the person comes to the page

00:16:03,229 --> 00:16:07,910
they're seeing what they want to see and

00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:10,279
that is exactly what we're trying to do

00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:13,009
here with the personalization so what

00:16:10,279 --> 00:16:14,899
this is allows for is that that first

00:16:13,009 --> 00:16:17,209
touch that somebody has from a campaign

00:16:14,899 --> 00:16:19,220
that you have or that landing page

00:16:17,209 --> 00:16:23,089
they're instantly getting that

00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:25,999
personalized experience so now we're

00:16:23,089 --> 00:16:29,359
gonna talk about our results so we get

00:16:25,999 --> 00:16:31,489
into this crawl stage right and so a lot

00:16:29,359 --> 00:16:33,229
of us you know in the marketing area and

00:16:31,489 --> 00:16:35,989
I kind of straddle both marketing and

00:16:33,229 --> 00:16:37,809
developers and you know marketing has a

00:16:35,989 --> 00:16:43,429
lot of asks for these developers well

00:16:37,809 --> 00:16:45,019
sometimes so sometimes we have to make

00:16:43,429 --> 00:16:46,369
the case we have to say okay we want to

00:16:45,019 --> 00:16:48,109
spend this much amount of time on

00:16:46,369 --> 00:16:50,809
something how do we make that case well

00:16:48,109 --> 00:16:53,839
there has to be ROI right so this crawl

00:16:50,809 --> 00:16:57,529
stage we got two hundred and sixty-six

00:16:53,839 --> 00:17:01,399
percent increase in interaction with the

00:16:57,529 --> 00:17:03,470
persona of operator and then 72 percent

00:17:01,399 --> 00:17:05,000
increase on the persona marketer so we

00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:08,179
were giving them what they want and even

00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:10,339
at that really really small crawl stage

00:17:08,179 --> 00:17:12,889
we're at least seeing some interaction

00:17:10,339 --> 00:17:15,649
some ROI from that so then we present to

00:17:12,889 --> 00:17:17,509
the marketers and we say hey listen hold

00:17:15,649 --> 00:17:18,919
off on all those asks you got I got a

00:17:17,509 --> 00:17:22,189
little bit of something that you might

00:17:18,919 --> 00:17:24,049
be interested in and we're gonna start

00:17:22,189 --> 00:17:25,519
to work on this walk stage if you can

00:17:24,049 --> 00:17:29,210
give me a little bit of time to work on

00:17:25,519 --> 00:17:32,149
that and so we did that and we saw a 64%

00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:33,679
increase in interactions so people

00:17:32,149 --> 00:17:36,740
interacting with their content seeing

00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:39,799
what we have and then 22% decrease in

00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:41,870
bounce rate and so what that shows me is

00:17:39,799 --> 00:17:47,240
that we're giving people what they want

00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:50,750
at their first touch and anytime you can

00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:52,039
make your developers happy is a really

00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:54,289
good thing to do from a marketing

00:17:52,039 --> 00:17:56,870
perspective so I would strongly suggest

00:17:54,289 --> 00:17:58,669
that I'm not saying that personalization

00:17:56,870 --> 00:18:00,110
will do it for everyone but I can

00:17:58,669 --> 00:18:02,690
certainly say that it actually did it

00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:04,039
for us and I kind of talked a big game

00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:05,779
and we were having this whole initial

00:18:04,039 --> 00:18:07,220
conversation about making this straight

00:18:05,779 --> 00:18:10,039
than making this investment in resources

00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:12,590
and I was very pleasantly surprised that

00:18:10,039 --> 00:18:14,480
we were actually able to get such

00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:16,279
amazing such amazing results both with

00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:18,289
the recommended content and then of

00:18:16,279 --> 00:18:19,669
course the CX report as well which is

00:18:18,289 --> 00:18:23,630
something that's a huge marketing

00:18:19,669 --> 00:18:25,340
initiative for us with that I'm happy to

00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:26,870
take questions I also know that it's

00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:28,429

anything answer any questions but I know

00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:37,490
