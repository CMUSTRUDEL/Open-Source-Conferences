Title: DrupalCon Seattle 2019: Accelerate with Service Autowiring!
Publication date: 2019-04-12
Playlist: Drupalcon Seattle 2019
Description: 
	Services? Yea, you've worked with them: registering them in {modulename}.services.yml, adding arguments, using them. Great! While you've been crushing it, Symfony has been busy too - with new features to accelerate how you work!

In this talk, we'll discover service autowiring, auto-registration and autoconfiguration: a set of features that will make you move faster and *love* the process! Just created a new service class and ready to use it? No need to touch *any* configuration files. Need to add another constructor argument? Type-hint it and keep coding: no YAML involved.

This talk assumes aÂ basic understanding of Drupal 8 - and we'll walk through the basics of services in the beginning. By the end, you'll be confident and ready to leverage these new features to work faster. Zoom!
