Title: DrupalCon Seattle 2019: Accelerate with Service Autowiring!
Publication date: 2019-04-12
Playlist: Drupalcon Seattle 2019
Description: 
	Services? Yea, you've worked with them: registering them in {modulename}.services.yml, adding arguments, using them. Great! While you've been crushing it, Symfony has been busy too - with new features to accelerate how you work!

In this talk, we'll discover service autowiring, auto-registration and autoconfiguration: a set of features that will make you move faster and *love* the process! Just created a new service class and ready to use it? No need to touch *any* configuration files. Need to add another constructor argument? Type-hint it and keep coding: no YAML involved.

This talk assumes a basic understanding of Drupal 8 - and we'll walk through the basics of services in the beginning. By the end, you'll be confident and ready to leverage these new features to work faster. Zoom!

because we have half an hour's and we

00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:09,179
have lots of fun stuff to get through my

00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:12,059
first my disclaimer is I like to be

00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:15,210
mobile and I'm sort of stuck to this

00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:17,100
microphone so if I'm some more liquid

00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:17,340
than normal and we'll just blame it on

00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,680
that

00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:20,850
yeah so I'm gonna say put right here

00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:25,109
instead of wandering over there and

00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:26,460
pointing at the screen yeah this is

00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:31,800
gonna be very interesting cool

00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:33,600
so anyways welcome to what service you

00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,399
come from the symphony world actually so

00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,230
hi my name is Ryan

00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:39,360
I've been around Drupal for a long time

00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:40,620
my first site in it yet but I know a

00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,820
decent bit about it cuz I come from the

00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:43,290
symphony world I'm the lead and

00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:44,610
documentation team and I work on a lot

00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:46,320
of things related to developer

00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:48,899
experience i'ma write it for Symphony

00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:51,809
casts that's my day job I'm generally

00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:53,640
just like a symphony fanboy and a

00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:55,440
husband of the much more talented and

00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,300
makes everything actually work in my

00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,370
life and our business Symphony Cass

00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:02,820
Liana she used to come to this

00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:05,939
conference but then we had a kid school

00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:08,939
I've got more complicated you know so

00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:11,060
she is at home right now but you can

00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:20,189
tweet at her and be like hey Leanna is

00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:22,020
the baby asleep yet so to the much more

00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:23,729
charming son Beckett because then we

00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:25,200
have a kid and you guys are my captive

00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:26,729
audience so I get to show you a picture

00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,540
and you have to sit there and look at it

00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:32,250
I used to I used to have like multiple

00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:33,170
pictures but it got got a little out of

00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:41,460
hand

00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:43,290
all right so service configuration setup

00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:44,939
so when I go through a couple of bits of

00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:48,509
code here and and so you can kind of get

00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:50,549
an idea of what we're building and so

00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:52,829
this isn't gonna be kind of cold yet is

00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:54,299
hopefully somewhat familiar the idea

00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:55,950
behind it so we're gonna start with we

00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:57,090
have this class these two guys up here

00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:59,190
we're in my workshop yesterday so

00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:00,490
they're gonna recognize this class

00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:02,140
[Music]

00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:04,450
because of course we are in the land of

00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:05,979
coffee and it has a method in that

00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:07,869
called prepared drink you pass it an

00:02:05,979 --> 00:02:09,369
argument and it returns a string so just

00:02:07,869 --> 00:02:11,410
imagine this is a class that you created

00:02:09,369 --> 00:02:14,290
for some reason and you're using it who

00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:16,630
knows various places in your code great

00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:17,890
when we're inside a custom module all

00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:22,180
the code is gonna be inside of a custom

00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:24,430
module more complicated than that we

00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:27,370
decided that we needed some third we

00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:29,230
need some service so I've also I've used

00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:31,450
I'm using the pendency injection here to

00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:32,860
get the config factory service if you're

00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:34,390
not familiar with that service it

00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:36,160
doesn't matter that's a service that

00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:38,200
lives in the container and so I'm using

00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,180
proper dependency injection you know

00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:41,319
adding the constructor and the argument

00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:43,209
to the constructor setting another

00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:45,450
property so I'm using dependency

00:02:43,209 --> 00:02:48,790
injection to get access to that service

00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:50,500
and of course want to do this in order

00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:54,040
to be able to use this barista class and

00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:56,590
in order for Drupal's container to be

00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:58,660
able to pass me the confections conduct

00:02:56,590 --> 00:03:00,849
config Factory I'm gonna need a source

00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:02,769
as well so I have my coffee shop

00:03:00,849 --> 00:03:05,260
services that yamo at the root of my

00:03:02,769 --> 00:03:07,209
module and I have the machine idea of my

00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:09,549
service which is coffee shop a barista

00:03:07,209 --> 00:03:11,170
the class name and of course I've

00:03:09,549 --> 00:03:13,420
specified the argument I have one

00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:15,940
argument and it is the config factory

00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:17,260
service at configure factory so

00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:18,730
hopefully this is least somewhat

00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:21,760
familiar to you this is our starting

00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:23,680
points and ok and now that we have this

00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,570
registered as a service if we wanted to

00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,180
use it from anywhere but for example

00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:29,680
from a controller I can say Drupal

00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:31,390
kolonko and get container there's other

00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,220
ways to do it but Drupal con will go and

00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:34,209
get container arrow get coffee shop

00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:35,680
barista

00:03:34,209 --> 00:03:37,690
so I fetched that service out of the

00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,950
container the container knows to pass me

00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:41,290
that config factory is the first

00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:43,389
argument and and I'm able to call my

00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:45,190
prepared drink method on it so we have

00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:47,440
one class that class is using dependency

00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:49,900
injection it's registered as a service

00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,650
this is like the very kind of

00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:54,160
traditional

00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:57,060
verbose service configuration that that

00:03:54,160 --> 00:04:01,660
is kind of worked for years and years so

00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:05,079
this is great except that we did way too

00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:06,190
much work I haven't done something like

00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:09,190
that

00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:11,170
if you're not familiar with using this

00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:12,700
Symphony framework I get a copy and

00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:14,050
paste it all that code into a symphony

00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:16,660
framework and it would have worked

00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:19,060
it's exactly the same however I haven't

00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:22,990
written code like that for years that

00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:25,300
has way too much work we do it that way

00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:26,620
so we basically eliminated all that and

00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:28,990
I'm gonna take you guys your step by

00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:30,940
step the things that you can actually do

00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:33,940
in Drupal today to do less work than

00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:37,870
that so the first thing was the machine

00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:38,710
ID we're going onto the machine ID what

00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:40,660
you might seem a little weird at first

00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:43,270
but let me show you what I mean this is

00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:45,430
not a there was no patch to Symphony or

00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:46,750
Drupal that made this possible this is

00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:49,420
just something you always could have

00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:51,370
done it's not a oh my god a hallelujah

00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:54,610
moment it's just a slight simplification

00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:57,520
all right most of the time you only have

00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:59,760
if you have a class you usually register

00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,870
that clients as a service one time

00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:03,910
sometimes you have a class and you you

00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:05,140
make like three services and you pass it

00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:06,490
like different arguments or something

00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:08,410
but that's not the normal case usually

00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:10,570
have a class you register it as a

00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:12,070
service one time in the container so if

00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:13,900
you're doing that why not just make

00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:15,430
these service ID the class name it's

00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:17,830
just a little bit easier to read so if

00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:19,120
you look at our controller I know if you

00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:21,580
were like looking at this six months

00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,870
later maybe it's what you're getting out

00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:24,430
of the container you don't have to go

00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:26,260
through this layer all but what's that

00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:28,419
machine ID I wonder what kind of

00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:29,860
instance that gives me it's just like

00:05:28,419 --> 00:05:31,330
it's people but it doesn't have to be

00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:32,800
but it's probably this thing unless

00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:34,840
somebody's really trying to screw with

00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,300
me and making the service I do something

00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:40,480
that's just wrong so it's just like a

00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:43,120
little bit easier to read and you can

00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:45,160
even use the colon colon clean syntax

00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,230
and if you're using editor like phpstorm

00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:49,630
that's really easy because you would say

00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:51,490
like you know Drupal colon colon get

00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:54,640
container arrow get and then you'd be

00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:56,050
typing like Bao and hit tab and it would

00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:57,960
have the you statement on time for you

00:05:56,050 --> 00:06:00,970
and then you just do Colin Colin class

00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:03,910
okay so even less typing I'm super clear

00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:05,860
what I'm getting out of a container so

00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:07,330
if we have just like that one classes

00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:08,800
you know rich is a service one time we

00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:13,540
don't really need that extra layer of

00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:15,430
machine ID abstraction in the way it

00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:18,080
also turns out and this is something

00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:19,970
that required a patch this is available

00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:23,389
dribble 8.6 this is something you can do

00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:25,490
right now if your ID is a class name you

00:06:23,389 --> 00:06:27,199
don't need the class key so notice the

00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:28,550
class key is gone here because it was a

00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:30,289
little redundant before to have like

00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:32,599
this ID which was this long thing and

00:06:30,289 --> 00:06:35,360
then class below it which was the exact

00:06:32,599 --> 00:06:37,189
same string so you can just do this it

00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:41,240
fills in the class for you so that's

00:06:37,189 --> 00:06:42,439
kind of nice so let's add a second

00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,759
service then so this is gonna be another

00:06:42,439 --> 00:06:45,500
spot where we're gonna add a little

00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:46,939
complexity to our application it's not

00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:49,039
anything new I'm not showing you a new

00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:51,319
feature so we decided we're gonna have a

00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:53,479
coffee machine which has a brew method

00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:55,069
it doesn't have any dependencies doesn't

00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:56,659
have a constructor it's just nice boring

00:06:55,069 --> 00:06:58,729
but we're going to write this as a

00:06:56,659 --> 00:07:01,039
service in a second and I'm making this

00:06:58,729 --> 00:07:03,349
coffee machine because I want to use it

00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:05,030
from within the barista class so in the

00:07:03,349 --> 00:07:07,340
barista class I'm adding a second

00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:09,469
constructor argument and just doing the

00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:12,560
normal dependency injection flow setting

00:07:09,469 --> 00:07:14,270
that on a second property and here but

00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:17,930
you can imagine going further than

00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:21,080
barista using the coffee machine to do

00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:27,560
something as soon as we have a second

00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:29,509
argument to the barista class there's no

00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:33,529
a second argument that you need to pass

00:07:29,509 --> 00:07:35,419
to barista when you instantiate it so

00:07:33,529 --> 00:07:37,129
that's fine so you know actually reading

00:07:35,419 --> 00:07:38,539
this from the bottom first first thing

00:07:37,129 --> 00:07:41,360
we're to do really is probably register

00:07:38,539 --> 00:07:43,129
on our new coffee machine class as a

00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,050
service we're gonna new use our new kind

00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:47,240
of class name instead of the machine ID

00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:49,460
way of doing that it has no argument so

00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:52,729
that's easy and then here I'm just gonna

00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:55,610
say act and then the long class name so

00:07:52,729 --> 00:07:58,750
to register that tea to tell the

00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:58,750
container that it needs to pass that

00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:08,779
this is another feature that is

00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:10,669
available already in gerbil today so

00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:13,190
with all the way it's an option that you

00:08:10,669 --> 00:08:15,259
can pass under your service so normally

00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:16,310
you just have class and arguments if you

00:08:15,259 --> 00:08:18,919
said all the way true

00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:21,860
you can take out the arguments the

00:08:18,919 --> 00:08:23,389
arguments can be empty because Drupal is

00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:24,710
going to figure out what you want to

00:08:23,389 --> 00:08:26,480
pass there

00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:29,720
and the way it does that is by reading

00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:31,370
the type hints so yeah this is not gonna

00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:32,750
work if you have a scalar arguments like

00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:33,830
like a string or something and we're

00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:35,810
gonna talk about how you handle that

00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:36,830
later but most of the time you're doing

00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:38,060
Otto walnut you're you're doing

00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:39,980
dependency injection because you need

00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:41,660
another service so if you do the type

00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:43,880
int then it's gonna get automatically

00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:47,090
passed to you now key question is how

00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:47,830
does that work and the answer is it

00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:49,880
depends

00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:51,080
there's actually I'm going to talk about

00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,280
this later but there's actually two

00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:54,500
different ways there's two different

00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:56,180
pieces of logic in Drupal and Symphony

00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:58,790
that that do this there's the old logic

00:08:56,180 --> 00:09:01,340
which still works in Drupal 8.6 and

00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:03,170
there's the new way of doing it so the

00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:05,720
old way of doing it which at this moment

00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:07,970
is what we're using the old way of doing

00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:09,410
it was basically when you had auto wire

00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:11,570
true for a service it looked at your

00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:14,030
type int looks at all of the services in

00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:15,680
the container and if one of the services

00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:17,780
in the container implements that

00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,550
interface or has that class you know cuz

00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:21,530
you can use the interface or class if it

00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:22,580
finds exactly woman that matches that it

00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:26,830
passes it to you

00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:30,020
if it finds 0 or 2 then you get an error

00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:31,940
that's what makes sense it was a little

00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:33,890
bit too magical for us so there's

00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:35,180
actually a newer one doing like a new

00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:36,890
strategy that's a little bit more

00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:38,390
explicit a little more out or you

00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:40,310
actually kind of control it more and I'm

00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:41,930
gonna talk about that later it's

00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:43,520
actually like going through and just

00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:45,560
saying yeah I see that there's one

00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:46,990
service in the container that implements

00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:49,640
the config directory interface so

00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:51,080
probably that's what you want and same

00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:52,610
thing obviously with - machine that's

00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,750
there's only one service with coffee

00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:56,450
machine so it just passes the

00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:59,680
confirmation to us so it means that our

00:09:56,450 --> 00:10:03,590
services point is starting to get skinny

00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:07,130
so I need to just be the class names and

00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:10,460
that's it so the next thing that we can

00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:12,500
do is apply some default service

00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:14,180
configuration because I have it here but

00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:17,690
you know our cocoa machine doesn't have

00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:19,940
any arguments on there all of our

00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:22,340
services you know so that way if we

00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:24,770
under machine service it's gonna allow

00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:26,510
us to just go into that class and I

00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:28,190
construct your argument type into it and

00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:30,140
just keep working you not need to go

00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:30,870
back to my services file and add auto

00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:34,750
wire

00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:36,830
you know wire up the argument explicitly

00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:39,900
[Music]

00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:42,600
wearing only fills in your missing

00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:44,430
arguments so if you are true under

00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:46,980
something and for some reason you

00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:48,840
decided to tell the Container ro of the

00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:50,730
constructor arguments I don't want to

00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:52,710
give us a big shoulder shrug okay

00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:54,240
looks like you did the work so it's

00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:55,920
actually safe to have auto bail on all

00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,030
the time and it's only going to try

00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:01,080
filling the stuff that you're missing

00:10:57,030 --> 00:11:03,960
anyways config we just do we just say

00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:06,150
like what register services just you

00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:08,280
know lik make them all all the water

00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:11,460
without meaning to say auto wire true

00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:16,410
auto wire true auto wire true and you

00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:19,050
actually can small lie do that adding

00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:20,880
this magic underscore defaults key this

00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:23,010
is a new feature that's coming from

00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:26,010
Symphony I'm just going to like a magic

00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:28,620
service ID here is a specific magic

00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:30,390
string and any configuration you put on

00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:33,870
there underscore defense is going to

00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:36,330
apply to every service in this file it's

00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:38,070
kind of this great like global slash

00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:41,100
local configurations not going to like

00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:42,780
modify service is coming from core or

00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:45,870
coming from some current trip module

00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:47,100
it's only gonna talk to a point to what

00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:49,110
you actually have in this for now so

00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:51,270
it's really really nice so if we do this

00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:55,620
like that's a small improvement we were

00:11:51,270 --> 00:12:02,790
able to get one services actually save

00:11:55,620 --> 00:12:04,700
this like ten lines of code this is

00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:10,220
where things really start to get bananas

00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:13,080
service auto registration because it's

00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:16,410
pattern here like every points I put in

00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:18,720
my service directory have a service

00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:21,960
directory I'm always registering them as

00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:24,690
a service and I'm always using the class

00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:27,930
name as the service ID you know I can't

00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:30,020
that maybe be automated a little bit an

00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:32,730
answer is actually yes

00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:34,410
so they put some tax here where you

00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:36,330
actually have sort of looks like a

00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:38,510
service but it has this resource key

00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:40,550
under it you actually kind of put the

00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:42,380
space prefix of what you kind of expect

00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:44,269
to be in that directory and this can go

00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:49,029
recursive this this can look at multiple

00:12:44,269 --> 00:12:51,320
sub directories service directory and

00:12:49,029 --> 00:12:53,000
resources that going up the pattern so

00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:54,470
you can actually say like look in this

00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,449
directory and this directory in this

00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:57,800
directory and match start this or

00:12:56,449 --> 00:12:59,329
anything like that there's also an

00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:01,040
exclude key so you could say like look

00:12:59,329 --> 00:13:02,600
look use this pattern in these

00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,250
directories but exclude this one

00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:05,420
directory in this other directory so you

00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:08,060
can use whatever kind of pattern you

00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:10,910
want to kind of lice alok ate where your

00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:12,199
service classes are everything in your

00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:14,389
source directory you is actually a

00:13:12,199 --> 00:13:17,449
service but the cipa is you want to kind

00:13:14,389 --> 00:13:19,279
of capture it with this let me just go

00:13:17,449 --> 00:13:31,699
someplace and registers and them as a

00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:33,110
service before you actually to them

00:13:31,699 --> 00:13:34,760
because they are being registered in

00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:36,920
this so suddenly we have the exact same

00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:38,959
thing that we had before just with no

00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:41,269
ones it just actually having to do any

00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:43,880
work so this is really like the

00:13:41,269 --> 00:13:45,680
game-changing thing because if you think

00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:48,529
about how it's going to look going

00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:50,360
forward in a mutual if I need to create

00:13:48,529 --> 00:13:52,490
a new service and start using it I'm

00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:53,870
going to touch no config I'm going to

00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:55,910
create a point to my service directory

00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:57,440
and it's immediately available to you

00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:59,660
somewhere because it's automatically

00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:01,220
registered as a service if I'm in some

00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:03,199
of the service and I decide I need a

00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:05,420
third constructor arguments I have a

00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:07,519
constructor arguments I type int it with

00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:09,889
the thing I need and I keep coding I

00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:11,389
don't go to a llamó file this is a big

00:14:09,889 --> 00:14:13,519
change we kind of introduced it's

00:14:11,389 --> 00:14:15,560
actually available in symphony 3.4 which

00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:17,930
is why extend Drupal apps but this is a

00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:21,949
big person symphony for like we want to

00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:23,899
keep you inside your code not constantly

00:14:21,949 --> 00:14:26,110
switching context to go back to like the

00:14:23,899 --> 00:14:28,819
framework Drupal kind of integration

00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:31,279
configuration level like stay in your

00:14:28,819 --> 00:14:36,459
code and keep coding so this is

00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:36,459
wonderful except that it doesn't work

00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:44,130
the problem is it's one of those weird

00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:47,520
cases where the code for this actually

00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:51,150
exists in Drupal but they overrode it

00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:52,770
and it's like a nice there's a question

00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:55,020
in the core of Drupal it's basically out

00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:56,760
of date oh there's an open issue tracker

00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:58,650
you can find it if you google for it

00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:59,100
online and this basically needs to be

00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:00,480
enabled

00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:02,340
I'm gonna give you a very quick

00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:05,580
workaround because this is actually very

00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:06,840
easy to re add yourselves I hope it will

00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:08,640
work soon it's not a big deal they just

00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:10,830
basically need to say like bring the new

00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:15,570
code kind of downstream and that it's

00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:17,250
going to work so you might not be

00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:20,610
familiar with this concept you'll see

00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:23,430
lots of controls if you would really do

00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:24,600
some custom service configurations you

00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:26,820
can create what's called a service

00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:28,680
provider you just basically create a

00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:31,860
class that lives directly in the source

00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:33,750
directory of your Drupal module and it

00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:35,730
needs to have become the module name

00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:37,410
service provider it needs to implement

00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:38,820
the service provider interface so it's

00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:40,920
one of those cases where you know you

00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:42,420
like named something exactly right and

00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:45,510
Drupal finds it one of those situations

00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:47,880
so if you find those rules then when you

00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:50,420
when the container is being built it's

00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:54,870
going to call this register function

00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:57,150
here so we are going to basically

00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:59,610
re-enter functionality and about twelve

00:15:57,150 --> 00:16:01,440
lines of code so we're going to use on a

00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:04,500
possible finder it comes from Symphony

00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:06,540
it's available and it's just a nice way

00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:07,860
to kind of find files okay point

00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:10,110
everything in the service directory that

00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:12,420
ends in star dot PHP and then we can

00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:14,070
loop over it then we can say the quest

00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:16,440
name is going to be a Drupal slash

00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:17,970
coffee shop slash service slash and then

00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:21,090
we're gonna grab the file name and just

00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:22,650
strip off of that PHP thing but this

00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:24,060
works great we're just getting the class

00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:25,980
name because we you know we know x of

00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:28,200
all of those rules so we're gonna

00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:30,860
continue on then for each okay we have

00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:33,450
this Queen's name so this is our kind of

00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:35,850
just looking at the for each one of the

00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:37,140
points name and only this contain a

00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:39,000
builder thing this is a little bit more

00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:40,760
advanced this is an object that helps

00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,110
build the services in the container so

00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:43,830
basically do is we ask the container has

00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:46,350
definition

00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:47,790
way of asking is this service or does

00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:50,370
this service already exist in the

00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:52,410
container yes or no and if it does we're

00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:54,060
just going to skip it and the reason why

00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:57,510
you'll see this in a second is this is

00:16:54,060 --> 00:17:00,060
gonna allow us to actually explicitly

00:16:57,510 --> 00:17:03,150
set these services in our services that

00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:05,670
Yama file and annotate if we decided to

00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:08,310
do that we skip it here because this is

00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:09,959
actually run after our services what we

00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:11,580
do is like do a bunch like have a

00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:13,560
situation where we actually do need to

00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:14,880
do some really custom configuration we

00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:16,950
put it in our services at yellow file

00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:19,650
and then this thing overloads it and

00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:21,060
kills all of our custom settings so this

00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:22,800
is basically saying if the users already

00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:24,300
registered this service then like we're

00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:26,459
gone just like use their so we're

00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:28,320
skipping it and then right here is this

00:17:26,459 --> 00:17:29,820
is basically on a PHP level how you

00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:31,230
register services you don't do this

00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:32,960
often but you create this thing called a

00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:35,280
definition you pass to the class

00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,990
unaware to true that kind of takes care

00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,280
of what underscore defaults thing or we

00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:39,570
set alright it's your everything and

00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:43,740
then we're gonna set that into the

00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:45,090
container so you know lines of code we

00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:47,160
now have everything in our service

00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:49,980
directory auto registered as a service

00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:55,020
and it's all set to auto wire which

00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:56,520
means that now becomes the most boring

00:17:55,020 --> 00:18:04,670
file that you have in your application

00:17:56,520 --> 00:18:09,390
there's literally nothing here there's

00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:09,870
two other things all right good perfect

00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:12,840
on time

00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:14,610
this is everything else I'm to show you

00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:16,830
is it actually works there's no more

00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:18,330
like and it doesn't work so those are

00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:19,560
the only twelve lines of code that you

00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:21,390
kind of need to have in your module

00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:22,830
right now to get it to work so another

00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:24,810
thing that is available right now and

00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:26,850
actually works I promise it's something

00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:28,800
called named arguments I love this

00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:29,940
feature so let's go back to something I

00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,680
mentioned earlier which is this

00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:33,360
automatic thing is all well and good as

00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:35,280
long as what you are trying to get is

00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,810
actually a service you know something

00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:40,230
that actually has a class of the type in

00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:41,640
some sense or configuration API key and

00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:43,800
then our database credentials something

00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:45,210
like that that you want to pass in like

00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:46,560
all the warnings not gonna work so I'm

00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:47,910
passing in the number of scoops that I

00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:50,910
should use my confi here it's an integer

00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:52,230
I used to steal it type inning but that

00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:52,900
doesn't help you know the container has

00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:56,410
no idea

00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:57,730
to pass there so if we do this and try

00:18:56,410 --> 00:19:00,040
to rebuild our caps we're gonna get this

00:18:57,730 --> 00:19:02,470
actually really nice air cannon auto

00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:05,080
wire service coffee machine argument

00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:07,930
number of scoops of method construct is

00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:10,780
type hinted int you should configure its

00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:13,000
value explicitly hey I don't know what

00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:16,030
to pass you and this is what things

00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:18,280
about in general is like all of your

00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:21,460
services are like when you do a

00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:23,020
container rebuild cast rebuild your

00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:25,150
services are basically validated if you

00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:26,920
have any even one spot where there's one

00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:28,840
argument where it can't figure out what

00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:30,700
to do with it even if it's not on its on

00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:31,900
some edge case page that you even forgot

00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:33,640
that somebody built five years ago

00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:35,800
you're not gonna be able to rebuild your

00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:37,809
cache at all if you have one mistake so

00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:39,250
there's no like secret weird edge case

00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:42,010
thing you didn't realize was broken

00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:43,210
because you may be removed a service and

00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:45,880
it was being all the wired somewhere

00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:48,429
that you forgot about it's definitely

00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:49,600
very yeah I can I can tell you

00:19:48,429 --> 00:19:51,340
confidently because we've been doing

00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:54,610
this in sympathy for years like this

00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:56,050
works great you do not have like the WTF

00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:58,480
moments that you would imagine that you

00:19:56,050 --> 00:20:03,160
would have from kind of this auto wire

00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:04,600
stuff so yeah this is easy enough let's

00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:06,340
gonna get in this situation it means

00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:09,640
that you are gonna have to explicitly

00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:12,280
configure your service example what you

00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:14,679
do imagine here is imagine that we do

00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:16,900
have this number of scoops arguments but

00:20:14,679 --> 00:20:19,240
imagine that the second argument we have

00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:23,020
a second here which is something we can

00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:25,000
auto wire first argument is something we

00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:27,700
gotta wear but the second argument is

00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,110
this int so you're like dang it so now

00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:30,970
you're telling me like as soon as I need

00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:32,920
to specify one argument I have to

00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:34,330
basically scrap the whole thing and kind

00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:41,230
of go back to the drawing board and

00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:42,400
specify all my arguments like it's : and

00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:44,080
then you have like you are a first

00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:48,220
argument comma second argument comma

00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:50,650
four argument so no arguments is

00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:52,780
something you can do and love named

00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:55,390
arguments this literally binds to the

00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:57,910
name of your argument which means you

00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:59,830
can have five constructor arguments

00:20:57,910 --> 00:21:03,250
can't be idle wired and so you just

00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:06,580
specified that one now this is a bit of

00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:09,430
weird case here because normally if you

00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:11,140
decided inside of your coffee machine

00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:12,430
class down there on the bottom if you

00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:14,620
decided that you wanted to rename that

00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:17,290
argument you could normally do that

00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:18,550
without any outside side-effects right

00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:19,930
if you just rename an argument to

00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:21,430
something it's still the first argument

00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:23,020
so anybody passing it down is gonna work

00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:25,060
fine so there's a little bit weird that

00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:27,190
if we rename that right now it's you

00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:29,550
like num of scoops or something like

00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:31,660
that an application would actually break

00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:34,510
because it's not bound to that argument

00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:36,910
anymore again the way it's good boy is

00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:38,680
if you try to rebuild your container at

00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:41,140
all you're gonna get an error that says

00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:43,840
the service coffee machine has an

00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:45,970
argument called number of scoops in the

00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:47,800
llamó file but we couldn't find that in

00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:48,730
your constructor you're probably doing

00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:50,560
something wrong

00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:53,980
so if it can't if you can't match that

00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:55,300
up then you're gonna get an error number

00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:56,680
of scoops intently it's gonna tell you

00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:57,760
that we can't automate some in the same

00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:59,230
areas before it's gonna say that we

00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:01,180
can't I oughta wire so it's actually

00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:05,470
very hard to screw this up and without

00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:06,970
knowing that you screwed something up so

00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:08,590
the next thing I'll talk about is that I

00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:10,000
mentioned earlier is the new way of

00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:12,490
doing auto wiring so I mentioned the

00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,720
logic before is that you add a type int

00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:15,550
and it just looks across all the

00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:19,690
services and tries to find exactly one

00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:22,660
that matches that type int so the truth

00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:25,150
is actually the in Drupal eight point

00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:26,560
six but what the old logic and the new

00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:28,570
logic are available and they're kind of

00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:30,250
working together the new logic which I'm

00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:32,140
going to explain right now is actually

00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:34,450
what takes precedence but if it fails

00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:36,250
then the old logic takes over and tries

00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:37,900
to fill in then tries to like you know

00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:39,910
scan over all the services and find

00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:43,330
something that actually matches so if

00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:45,340
you want to because this would basically

00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:46,960
kind of prepare you for Drupal 9 when

00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:49,180
you move to Symphony 4 and the old way

00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,770
is not available anymore if you're not

00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:52,420
so you can actually turn off the old way

00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:53,860
so you can have this like special

00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:55,360
parameter here which basically says I

00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:56,920
want to use the new way of all the wire

00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:58,360
you don't use that old magical way of

00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:59,740
scanning every service and looking to

00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:02,890
see if it implements the right interface

00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:05,380
or it has the right class as soon as we

00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:07,040
do that we're gonna get this error again

00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:09,080
it's a really nice error

00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:11,390
it says coming over service barista

00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:14,780
argument config factory references the

00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:17,690
interface config but no such service

00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:19,580
exists you should maybe alias this

00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:24,260
interface to the existing config dot

00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:26,780
factory service gosh love that air so

00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:31,940
the way that other wiring works now is

00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:34,370
it's so dumb I love it when you have a

00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:36,110
type int like you know Drupal / core /

00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:38,300
config slash config factory interface

00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:40,640
the operating system looks in the

00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:43,910
container to see if there is a service

00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:47,360
whose machine ID equals that string

00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:48,680
exactly so there's no like scanning

00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,970
everything it's just like gonna look in

00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:51,050
the container and say hey is there some

00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:52,910
is there a service in the container

00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:54,140
called Drupal /chorus slash config slash

00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:56,990
config factory interface

00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:58,370
yes or no so the one that you chew is

00:23:56,990 --> 00:24:00,500
the way you kind of configure like hey

00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:01,790
this this inter you know this coin store

00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:04,100
this interface should give me this

00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:06,140
service is you create something called a

00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:07,670
service alias which is something that's

00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:09,290
existed forever in symphony but it

00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:11,870
hasn't really been that important until

00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:14,000
now it's this symbolic link you can say

00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:15,230
anyone's has nothing to do with other

00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
why you could say hey when somebody

00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:18,650
asked for the service called foo wire I

00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,810
want actually you to give them that

00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:22,280
service but we can leverage it here

00:24:20,810 --> 00:24:24,380
because we can say hey whenever somebody

00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:26,360
asks for the service Drupal slash core

00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:28,670
slash config slash config factory

00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:31,640
service I actually want you to give them

00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:33,350
the config factory service and none of

00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:35,570
the auto wearing system looks in the

00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:37,550
container and it goes oh my gosh there

00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:39,710
is a service in the container called

00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:41,810
Drupal / course last config slash config

00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:43,640
factory interface so I'm gonna automata

00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:45,160
that and the error message is telling

00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:48,020
you that so they have message actually

00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:51,050
looked and I said no I don't don't see

00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:53,090
anything like that in the container is a

00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:55,580
message it actually looked at all the

00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:57,470
services determine that one of them does

00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:59,240
in fact implements interface and kind of

00:24:57,470 --> 00:25:01,100
gives you this hint I was like I don't

00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:03,470
see this class in the container but by

00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:04,220
the way I did find one that implements

00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:06,680
that interface

00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:08,420
maybe you should create alias to it or

00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:10,070
three of them you'd actually see like

00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:12,530
maybe she creates to one of these three

00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:16,070
services so it actually helps you out

00:25:12,530 --> 00:25:17,900
a coffee machine class we're used also

00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:19,730
using auto wearing on coffee machine

00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:21,830
class or me let me use the auto

00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:23,780
registration or more generally when we

00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:27,050
use on our class names as our machine

00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:29,540
IDs that means all of our classes are

00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:31,490
instantly Auto wire Bowl because there

00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:34,010
is really a service in the container

00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:36,260
called Drupal / coffee machine / service

00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:38,750
/ so I copy tops off service / coffee

00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:40,760
machine that's the service ID so this

00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:43,730
stuff is just gonna auto water instantly

00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:46,130
without doing anything so this is what

00:25:43,730 --> 00:25:48,200
an alias looks like it's your post nice

00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:49,580
corsage config vector anyplace instead

00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:54,430
of like you know constant arguments you

00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:58,330
just say alias config that Factory know

00:25:54,430 --> 00:26:02,150
ideally corner would do this for us

00:25:58,330 --> 00:26:03,530
ideally core would say you know we

00:26:02,150 --> 00:26:06,200
actually want to empower people to use

00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:07,760
auto wiring if they choose to so for

00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:10,520
some of the services that we deem like

00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:12,860
normally usable by their end users we're

00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:14,690
gonna go ahead and add these aliases for

00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:16,100
them so that we don't they can just like

00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:17,600
auto wire them into their application

00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:18,890
and this is something that I hope kind

00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,850
of along with that issue tracker I think

00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:21,230
one of that's one of things that they

00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:24,170
that they need to do if they want to do

00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:25,610
this I couldn't be a control module that

00:26:24,170 --> 00:26:27,230
you bring in that basically adds all

00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:29,090
these auto wiring aliases for all the

00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:30,500
core stuff doesn't know any extra

00:26:29,090 --> 00:26:31,370
overhead or anything like that so it's

00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,660
just something that they need to do to

00:26:31,370 --> 00:26:34,040
make your life easier because there's

00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:36,710
really no reason that we need to do this

00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:38,360
for all the core stuff you know so you

00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:40,520
do need to do it now for Auto wine core

00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:41,900
stuff and then you know you do it one

00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:44,240
time and then you can always otherwise

00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:45,910
this config dr interface anywhere and as

00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:51,590
you guys saw you get really nice air if

00:26:45,910 --> 00:26:56,120
if it's not there already so let's

00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:58,520
summarize here use class names as your

00:26:56,120 --> 00:27:00,770
service IDs because it just makes life

00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:01,790
easier you can stop right there that

00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:03,710
would just make your application a

00:27:01,790 --> 00:27:06,020
little bit cooler seconds use all the

00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:09,590
way are true and stop being lazy and

00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:12,410
omitting your arguments cool on three

00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:15,740
and four you know wait for Drupal to

00:27:12,410 --> 00:27:18,429
support this / take my twelve lines of

00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:20,510
decode and do service auto registration

00:27:18,429 --> 00:27:21,800
automatically register this directory

00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:23,390
that director in that party however you

00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:25,160
organize record into services in your

00:27:23,390 --> 00:27:28,940
module all the register those things as

00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:31,520
services and then can specify any non

00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:32,690
auto variable arguments the snow plows

00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:36,160
through the cracks

00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:39,679
specify those with the named arguments

00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:41,059
incentive you recommend doing this or

00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:42,200
you know doing this down the road at

00:27:41,059 --> 00:27:43,220
some point and what you know once you

00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,720
gotta get used to this because it you

00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:47,030
know it's gonna make you do a little bit

00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:49,429
more work to use this turn off the magic

00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:50,870
auto wiring it's gonna be it's just

00:27:49,429 --> 00:27:53,150
easier to think about you're gonna just

00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:54,559
never gonna be any question about about

00:27:53,150 --> 00:27:55,700
like what you're gonna get because

00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:58,610
you're gonna be in complete control of

00:27:55,700 --> 00:28:01,450
how Auto writing works and yeah that's

00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:01,450
thank you guys very much

00:28:05,890 --> 00:28:11,920
and you have lost you're wearing that

00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:13,720
car that's gonna it's a link to github

00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:15,580
that he's like the Queen everything we

00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:17,080
did queen step by step by step by step

00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:18,670
so you can actually see what it did and

00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:20,770
walk through and grab my like 15 lines

00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:22,390
of copy code from the symphony world so

00:28:20,770 --> 00:28:23,980
I'll do a plant for a symphony concert

00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:39,250
Oriole if you want to learn symphony or

00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:43,299
go check that out there questions when I

00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:50,290
was in the config directory can i that's

00:28:43,299 --> 00:28:52,750
that last word again yeah not the

00:28:50,290 --> 00:28:54,880
interface yeah totally so I could also

00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:58,179
alias Drupal sauce for slash config

00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:59,890
slash config factory to config that

00:28:58,179 --> 00:29:01,270
factory yep and in the symphony world

00:28:59,890 --> 00:29:02,919
because we like char like gently push

00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:05,020
people towards interface type ending we

00:29:02,919 --> 00:29:06,970
don't do that but like on a technical

00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:08,049
level yeah absolutely you can do that if

00:29:06,970 --> 00:29:09,580
you wanted to make things more friendly

00:29:08,049 --> 00:29:13,110
you'd probably like alias both of them

00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:13,110
you know yeah question

00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:51,510
you could have set up the default value

00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:57,570
in the constructor we're kind of

00:29:51,510 --> 00:30:08,370
thinking the like this thing number of

00:29:57,570 --> 00:30:10,110
scoops you could so so yeah I think

00:30:08,370 --> 00:30:12,630
that's good could you just come into the

00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:14,880
constructor and that the answer is

00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:16,110
absolutely but you're gonna get a lot of

00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,910
cases where you can't do that because

00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:19,830
what it actually is like an API key

00:30:17,910 --> 00:30:21,060
scoop so you're sort of like want to

00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:22,440
have like a number of scoops the file

00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:24,120
value to three and I can override that

00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:25,860
if I wanted to but most of time I don't

00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:28,020
know the case we want like a database

00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:29,490
credentials or API key or something

00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:31,100
something like that we're like you

00:30:29,490 --> 00:30:32,910
really do need to kinda like pass it in

00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:34,260
you know maybe you're like reading it

00:30:32,910 --> 00:30:35,640
from somewhere that's not committed from

00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:37,290
a secrets place or something like that

00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:39,300
yeah totally if we had given a default

00:30:37,290 --> 00:30:40,440
value we would not need to specify it

00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:41,870
because the container doesn't need to

00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:44,880
pass it yeah

00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:46,500
hey man so assuming we went through and

00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:55,590
did this would we still need a blank

00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:58,230
services AMA file you actually need any

00:30:55,590 --> 00:31:00,090
services that you know file until you

00:30:58,230 --> 00:31:01,350
need to specify that one argument that

00:31:00,090 --> 00:31:03,090
can't be out of wired then you'll create

00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:05,910
it so you probably in practice will have

00:31:03,090 --> 00:31:08,790
one in the future once that like on the

00:31:05,910 --> 00:31:10,920
registration and defaults thing makes it

00:31:08,790 --> 00:31:12,690
back to Drupal then your service that

00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:13,980
you know flow will always exist because

00:31:12,690 --> 00:31:15,660
you at least have like those four

00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:18,030
as a code you know my mother wearing all

00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:20,010
my things by defense and I'm doing my

00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:21,990
service auto registration for this

00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:23,070
directory so we can add normal Symphony

00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:25,380
project when we start a new symphony

00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:27,690
project on our services IMO has like

00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:29,549
those five lines of code and you might

00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:31,230
actually code quite a bit before you

00:31:29,549 --> 00:31:32,850
actually ever need to go back and do

00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:34,710
anything else in that file but it's just

00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:39,120
kind of like sitting there activating

00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:41,100
the magic but not doing anything else it

00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:44,070
seemed like your workaround solution was

00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:46,679
meant to be contributed to each or meant

00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:48,330
to be written in each module is there a

00:31:46,679 --> 00:31:52,160
way to abstract that out one more level

00:31:48,330 --> 00:31:52,160
so there's only like one thing to remove

00:31:54,290 --> 00:31:58,340
something that was like specific to that

00:31:56,490 --> 00:32:02,000
module so you'd have to have that stuff

00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:09,870
like in every single specific module

00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:11,309
how would you abstract that I'm there's

00:32:09,870 --> 00:32:12,630
an easy answer that's kind of cheating

00:32:11,309 --> 00:32:15,150
and then there's a different answer

00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:19,740
because there's nothing stopping you

00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:23,010
from having one class in one module

00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:33,030
which is also registering the services

00:32:23,010 --> 00:32:36,120
for your other five modules in all of

00:32:33,030 --> 00:32:38,549
your individual modules actually like

00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:39,960
I'll talk to maybe like one core module

00:32:38,549 --> 00:32:43,320
that they're dependent on which has like

00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:45,450
the bulk of the logic like yeah you have

00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:48,660
to have separate places right now until

00:32:45,450 --> 00:32:54,840
we get that and network around or I

00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:56,549
should say questions in practice like if

00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:58,470
you've got your interfaces in the same

00:32:56,549 --> 00:33:06,179
folder as your services which isn't

00:32:58,470 --> 00:33:07,200
unusual how would you do it man that's

00:33:06,179 --> 00:33:09,750
such a good question

00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:11,490
he's like no I believe my own module and

00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:12,809
I have like like in my service truck to

00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:14,669
have some services but I'm not so great

00:33:12,809 --> 00:33:15,330
on my own interfaces that my services

00:33:14,669 --> 00:33:17,130
implement

00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:18,029
event would being so I'm gonna give you

00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:19,769
to answer that

00:33:18,029 --> 00:33:22,169
you'd have to do a little bit of like

00:33:19,769 --> 00:33:23,700
extra logic in that glue code you know I

00:33:22,169 --> 00:33:25,289
got to say like a movie if you suffix it

00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:26,940
everything with interface then like you

00:33:25,289 --> 00:33:29,070
know skip over those ones in the for

00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:31,379
each loop or actually like look at the

00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:32,669
you know once you get the class you can

00:33:31,379 --> 00:33:34,259
actually do a class exist or an

00:33:32,669 --> 00:33:35,820
interface exists to see if it's an

00:33:34,259 --> 00:33:36,659
interface or it's a class so your books

00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:40,229
gonna have to put that in your work

00:33:36,659 --> 00:33:43,609
around once the feature gets back into

00:33:40,229 --> 00:33:46,049
Drupal oh I already works out of the box

00:33:43,609 --> 00:33:47,820
with the actual auto registration

00:33:46,049 --> 00:33:49,259
feature when the actual idle

00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:51,149
registration feature from Symphony when

00:33:49,259 --> 00:33:53,070
it goes over that service director for

00:33:51,149 --> 00:33:56,399
example if it finds something that's an

00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:57,869
interface and it finds only one thing

00:33:56,399 --> 00:33:59,759
inside of that director that implements

00:33:57,869 --> 00:34:02,399
that interface it automatically adds an

00:33:59,759 --> 00:34:04,649
alias for the interface that points to

00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:06,299
your service so it means that you can

00:34:04,649 --> 00:34:07,830
actually describe missing credit and

00:34:06,299 --> 00:34:10,379
interface and you know make your service

00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:11,639
implement interface and instantly start

00:34:10,379 --> 00:34:14,220
going to other parts of your code and

00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:16,200
type in ting the interface and getting

00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:19,829
your actual concrete class because it

00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:24,329
makes that mapping for you so again in

00:34:19,829 --> 00:34:27,329
the future even easier yeah yeah so it's

00:34:24,329 --> 00:34:28,829
not the M and the other education

00:34:27,329 --> 00:34:30,419
feature in symphony when you're not

00:34:28,829 --> 00:34:31,500
having to do the work round if it let's

00:34:30,419 --> 00:34:33,510
say it looks at your source directory

00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:35,549
and it sees like a coffee shop class

00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:38,339
button also sees that you have a coffee

00:34:35,549 --> 00:34:39,659
shop interface and of course the

00:34:38,339 --> 00:34:40,799
conference on points implements the

00:34:39,659 --> 00:34:41,940
coffee shop interface and this is an

00:34:40,799 --> 00:34:43,559
interface you created just because you

00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:44,639
wanna have interfaces what something is

00:34:43,559 --> 00:34:46,349
gonna do is it's gonna automatically

00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:49,169
register your coffee shop points as a

00:34:46,349 --> 00:34:50,639
service but it's also going to see that

00:34:49,169 --> 00:34:52,409
accomplish type interface and it's gonna

00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:54,089
see that you only have one class that

00:34:52,409 --> 00:34:55,710
implements that so this doesn't happen

00:34:54,089 --> 00:34:57,029
if you had like two coffee you know two

00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:58,380
different classes that both implement an

00:34:57,029 --> 00:34:59,579
interface but because there's only one

00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:01,470
commercial plants that influence that

00:34:59,579 --> 00:35:03,240
interface so it's gonna finish your

00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:05,039
coffee shop as a class as a service and

00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:08,460
then it's going to register the coffee

00:35:05,039 --> 00:35:11,460
shop interface as a service alias that

00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:12,480
points to your coffee shop class so you

00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:13,710
actually end up with kind of two things

00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:15,329
in the container and I put the coffee

00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:17,039
shop class and then you have at the

00:35:15,329 --> 00:35:18,900
coffee shop interface which is not a

00:35:17,039 --> 00:35:21,220
real service but just an alias to your

00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:22,329
coffee shop class the end result is

00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:23,829
you create the collapse you create the

00:35:22,329 --> 00:35:25,569
interface and then you immediately go

00:35:23,829 --> 00:35:27,430
somewhere else and you type int the

00:35:25,569 --> 00:35:29,770
interface in your constructor and it

00:35:27,430 --> 00:35:32,079
just works it knows to get your concrete

00:35:29,770 --> 00:35:34,569
class you don't have like a extra wiring

00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:39,240
to say this interface you know points to

00:35:34,569 --> 00:35:39,240
this class yeah really good question

00:35:42,490 --> 00:35:48,030
so assuming someone here was going to

00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:48,030
contribute this back to Drupal core or a

00:35:48,359 --> 00:35:54,119
contributed man wait what do you mean

00:35:52,390 --> 00:35:56,859
the old aliases is deprecated

00:35:54,119 --> 00:35:58,829
so like config dot factory right

00:35:56,859 --> 00:36:03,190
theoretically we should stop using that

00:35:58,829 --> 00:36:06,730
you should so using factory because

00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:10,450
there might still be cases where this is

00:36:06,730 --> 00:36:12,970
we still use the snake case machine and

00:36:10,450 --> 00:36:14,890
machine names for our services and we

00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:16,329
might have about 200 services and then

00:36:14,890 --> 00:36:17,950
we assign about a hundred of those are

00:36:16,329 --> 00:36:19,450
actually services that really are meant

00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:21,760
to be used by the users day and a day

00:36:19,450 --> 00:36:23,680
out and so we had aliases for those 100

00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:25,030
but the other one when you can't

00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:26,859
actually get unless you actually use the

00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:28,660
old snake case version it's nice to kind

00:36:26,859 --> 00:36:30,520
of say hey I really there's 200 services

00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:32,280
here you can use all of them because you

00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:34,270
could just you know do old school

00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:35,500
registration of your arguments you use

00:36:34,270 --> 00:36:36,640
all of them but these are probably 100

00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:40,810
you want to use because we think that

00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:43,030
they're more common the the other thing

00:36:40,810 --> 00:36:44,710
is that with contribs

00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:46,569
you should always you should not you

00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:48,160
should not use auto where with controls

00:36:46,569 --> 00:36:50,230
and it's a slight performance ever

00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:52,089
overhead during development only during

00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:55,510
cached rebuilt only if you don't like a

00:36:52,089 --> 00:36:57,099
point where you know contribute lee do

00:36:55,510 --> 00:36:58,900
everything so that you don't add that

00:36:57,099 --> 00:37:00,520
little extra overhead like if your new

00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:02,440
module you need to do things like the

00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:03,640
slow boring way so that the people that

00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:05,380
use your controller will have like a

00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:06,630
little bit of an easier life no more

00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:08,619
broadly though there is a feature in

00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:10,390
symphony so a feature in drupal to

00:37:08,619 --> 00:37:12,160
deprecate services it's something you're

00:37:10,390 --> 00:37:13,810
probably gonna start seeing as Drupal 8

00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:15,849
gets closer to triple 9 it's actually a

00:37:13,810 --> 00:37:18,160
key lawyer services I say deprecated

00:37:15,849 --> 00:37:20,050
true and if anybody uses that then it

00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:21,280
shows those as deprecated it's not

00:37:20,050 --> 00:37:22,270
available right now but then a newer

00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:25,230
version of Symphony you can also

00:37:22,270 --> 00:37:25,230
deprecated aliases

00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:36,060
is isn't using the class name as the

00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:40,440
service ID kind of getting us back to a

00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:42,180
singleton services is using the class

00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:44,250
name as the service I'd be getting

00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:46,260
aspect of a single bit pattern in a

00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:48,150
container world we aren't we it there

00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:49,170
our services are single pins and then

00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:50,880
that singleton is because we're going to

00:37:49,170 --> 00:37:52,800
actually using the static context with

00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:54,930
Singleton's is they rely on the static

00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:56,040
context to actually guarantee that

00:37:54,930 --> 00:37:57,750
there's only one thing in that we

00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:59,580
actually in remember with services we

00:37:57,750 --> 00:38:01,740
actually only want most of the time one

00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:04,470
instance of a service hanging around but

00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:06,270
we don't use Singleton's what do we do

00:38:04,470 --> 00:38:08,340
that's why the container exists so we

00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:10,050
can get the goodness of Singleton's we

00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:13,500
don't need ten coffeeshops

00:38:10,050 --> 00:38:14,850
sorry pumping machines services we need

00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:16,830
one coffee machine service and we'll

00:38:14,850 --> 00:38:18,330
call the method one at ten times so we

00:38:16,830 --> 00:38:20,430
want that singleton thing we don't want

00:38:18,330 --> 00:38:32,580
this singleton pattern the container is

00:38:20,430 --> 00:38:34,860
what allows us to do that is that if you

00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:36,600
look like if you wrote your classes

00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:38,310
using dependency injection and type

00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:41,930
painting interfaces like we did if you

00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:44,010
didn't practice designing your services

00:38:41,930 --> 00:38:46,380
and then you changed your entire

00:38:44,010 --> 00:38:48,090
application use auto wearing and you did

00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:49,730
four requests you'd notice that you

00:38:48,090 --> 00:38:52,920
didn't touch any of your PHP classes

00:38:49,730 --> 00:38:54,300
this is all configuration based yeah so

00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:58,320
your classes are also written in fact

00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:59,880
it's it nudges you towards doing things

00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:02,250
correctly because if you don't have a

00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:06,780
type int donut you don't get any wiring

00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:09,000
that's annoying I said in symphony we

00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:12,090
had the the author lying alias is only

00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:14,880
for the interfaces don't really need you

00:39:12,090 --> 00:39:17,850
to you know and if you do like if you

00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:19,620
type in for a country class but only the

00:39:17,850 --> 00:39:21,210
alias for the interface exists you're

00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:22,980
gonna be an analyst says I didn't find

00:39:21,210 --> 00:39:24,840
this in the container but I didn't

00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:28,000
notice that there's an another service

00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:30,220
that this class you try to type it with

00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:32,230
implements did you maybe mean to use

00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:33,430
that type int instead of the concrete

00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:35,550
class give it a real plate really clear

00:39:33,430 --> 00:39:35,550
air

00:39:39,050 --> 00:39:45,159
