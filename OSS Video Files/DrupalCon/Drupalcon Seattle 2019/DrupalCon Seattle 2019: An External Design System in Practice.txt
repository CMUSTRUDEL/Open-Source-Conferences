Title: DrupalCon Seattle 2019: An External Design System in Practice
Publication date: 2019-04-12
Playlist: Drupalcon Seattle 2019
Description: 
	When developing a pattern library or design system that will be used in support of a Drupal project, a key decision must be made regarding where the design system should live. Conceptually, many agree that it should be an external dependency of a Drupal theme in order to promote reuse, but a large number of projects still embed the design system inside of the theme in order to simplify workflow and component integration.

While in the past I’ve occasionally found it difficult to justify developing a design system independently from Drupal, on a recent rebranding project I made the case to configure a workflow using this approach. At the start, our plan was to migrate 3 sites into Drupal 8. By the end of the project we ended up with a partial migration to Drupal 8, with two supporting sites still in WordPress - all under the same brand and using the exact same components. In the middle it became apparent that choosing to use an external design system up front allowed us to make decisions that would have otherwise been impossible, and had a major impact on our ability to still hit our planned launch date as the project evolved.

In reviewing this rebranding effort, we’ll take a closer look at our approach to a shared design system including:

The structure of our design system repository

Requiring the design system in your Drupal project as a composer dependency

Workflow and managing releases

Using Twig components in WordPress with the Timber Plugin

Challenges and areas for future improvement


By the end of this session you will have a better understanding of when using an external design system could benefit your project, along with a clearer understanding of how this approach could be implemented.

	00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:06,330
all right everybody ready it's time 30

00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,750
minutes yeah that's what I'm talking

00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:13,950
about yeah that's um end of the day

00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:15,420
energy ie yes coffee I have everybody

00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:17,070
likes both Drupal and coffee I have

00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:20,550
stickers that involve both those things

00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:21,600
so come come again yes coming this

00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:23,039
session just paid off for everybody

00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,000
anyway I'm talking about how it's a

00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:25,640
30-minute session and then I'm just

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,289
rambling up at the front so let's get in

00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:32,820
so this is external design system in

00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:34,290
practice and I am Brian Perry I'm a lead

00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:36,480
front-end developer bounteous

00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:39,000
I live in the Chicago suburbs I am a

00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,590
lover of all things component based and

00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,500
component driven building with

00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:45,200
components in Drupal design systems and

00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:47,550
tools like pattern lab and increasingly

00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,800
building with component based JavaScript

00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:52,320
frameworks like react and I'm also a

00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:53,910
lover of all things Nintendo so if you

00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,340
want to talk to me about any of the cool

00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:58,829
games that you're playing by all means I

00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:00,480
am available on the internet in a bunch

00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:00,899
of places and would love to internet

00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,890
with you

00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:07,110
however you see fit and a company called

00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:09,119
baniyas and I really appreciate them

00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:11,760
sending me out here work with a great

00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:14,040
team of Drupal folks Drupal is one of a

00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,540
handful of things that we do but love

00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,340
the people that I work with we also have

00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:19,560
an open an architect position if you're

00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:23,580
looking to to work with us that would be

00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:25,979
wonderful and you might not know me as

00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:27,630
working at a company called bounteous

00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:30,990
maybe if you do know me you know me

00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:34,340
working at hs2 solutions I didn't quit

00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:36,900
it is the same company we rebranded and

00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:39,750
this is kind of the jumping off point to

00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:41,490
the story and how you know I fell into

00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:42,720
using an external design system on a

00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:46,229
project and changing my approach a

00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:49,909
little bit so let's let's look at this

00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:54,119
through the lens of our rebranding story

00:01:49,909 --> 00:01:57,810
so we have our old hs2 solutions website

00:01:54,119 --> 00:02:01,409
on the left and our new boniest

00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:04,049
website on the right different sites we

00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:07,290
were looking to launch our brand on

00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:08,940
November 5th 2018 even though it didn't

00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:09,869
really feel like it to me on a day to

00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:11,790
day basis

00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:13,260
the website was just one part of a

00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:15,540
larger coordinated effort

00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:18,690
press releases new business cards new

00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:23,250
email addresses IT changes and also a

00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:25,739
website so part of the reason that we

00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:28,560
were rebranding is that we had a number

00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:30,720
of acquisitions and kind of new new

00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,489
friends in the company so we're actually

00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,530
looking to migrate a handful of

00:02:32,489 --> 00:02:37,200
different sites into a new Drupal 8

00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:40,379
build there was our Drupal 7 hs2

00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:42,720
solutions website Luna metrics comm on

00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:46,709
WordPress and infield digital hustle on

00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:48,000
WordPress and the main thing were

00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:49,380
migrating was the blog content

00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,010
especially Luna metrics had a lot of

00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:54,510
great rich blog content and because

00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:55,470
we're branding some of the other content

00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:58,079
we were just kind of going to be

00:02:55,470 --> 00:03:01,500
recreating from scratch anyway

00:02:58,079 --> 00:03:03,120
when I was taking the lead on the

00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:05,160
migration so he's working on getting

00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:08,819
some of that data into our a new Drupal

00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:12,150
8 instance and at the same time I worked

00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:13,799
with our XD team especially Leon kind of

00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:15,359
taking the lead who was doing some

00:03:13,799 --> 00:03:18,540
initial water framing for concepts for

00:03:15,359 --> 00:03:20,730
our new site in sketch sharing things in

00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:23,160
envision and then as best I could I was

00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:25,230
following along in as close to real-time

00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:27,000
as possible prototyping things in code

00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:29,310
so that we could see it up on our feet

00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,739
actually work with it in a browser

00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:34,220
you know experimented non-traditional

00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:37,079
breakpoints all of that good stuff

00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:39,389
and then you know the process continued

00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:41,790
we have a more fully defined look and

00:03:39,389 --> 00:03:44,040
feel Jolene was taking the lead on that

00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:46,380
and continue to do the same thing keep

00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:48,030
working with these prototypes and

00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:51,000
incorporate the stuff in code so we

00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:53,099
could see it in browser and you know

00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,579
work nicely so at this point we had a

00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:59,540
nice set of prototypes in a separate

00:03:56,579 --> 00:04:03,900
repository and you know a pattern lab

00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:07,079
instance working with it so the question

00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:09,780
that we ask at this point is how are we

00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:11,370
going to get that stuff into our Drupal

00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:13,650
build and how are we going to make use

00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:16,530
of it and integrate it and I'm going to

00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:19,120
use a somewhat ridiculous analogy to

00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:21,630
explain this mustard and

00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:24,280
versus separate mustard and mayonnaise

00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:26,590
and if you are understanding the mustard

00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:30,639
mayonnaise reference Congrats on being a

00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:33,160
comedy nerd as well big points but so

00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:36,010
the the mustards approach was what I had

00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:38,470
mostly done in the past so pattern lab

00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:41,260
embedded in a Drupal theme and a lot of

00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:43,270
the component based or pattern lab

00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:45,699
friendly contribute a mess do the same

00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:48,580
thing there's advantages and

00:04:45,699 --> 00:04:51,160
disadvantages to this approach so it's

00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:52,840
easier for Drupal to get at your

00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:55,150
components that right there in your

00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:56,949
theme potentially there might be some

00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:59,080
ways the build process is simplified in

00:04:56,949 --> 00:05:01,300
this case for people who are not

00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:03,970
familiar with the component based

00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:04,810
approach it's gonna be a little bit

00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,070
easier for them to wrap their heads

00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:08,050
around they're gonna look in the theme

00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:13,139
and find the things that they can then

00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:15,610
change but it's also definitely prone to

00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:18,160
Drupal specific things finding their way

00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:21,490
into the components and then thinking of

00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:22,750
the the jar of mustard and is here with

00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:24,550
the lawyers on top of each other you

00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:26,740
know you put your your knife in there

00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:28,240
and take some out and then the mustard

00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:30,370
and mayonnaise starts to kind of get

00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,110
mixed up and it gets harder and harder

00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:34,780
to just have mustard or just have

00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:38,380
mayonnaise which you know may may or may

00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:40,270
not be a problem alternatively the state

00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:41,919
that we at this point in time is we had

00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:44,169
an independent project we had a

00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:46,419
completely separate repository that had

00:05:44,169 --> 00:05:49,510
our work-in-progress design system and a

00:05:46,419 --> 00:05:51,280
separate Drupal repository and you know

00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:54,460
in theory that that's going to promote

00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:55,870
reuse beyond just the Drupal project so

00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:57,400
you know the question that we had asked

00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:58,750
ourselves is where where should we put

00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:01,479
the mustard question you gotta ask

00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:04,000
yourself every day so we decided to keep

00:06:01,479 --> 00:06:05,560
the mustard separate no Heinz middle

00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,310
must which is a real thing that people

00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:12,699
can buy now for some reason so it keeps

00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:14,620
the components Drupal agnostic and I

00:06:12,699 --> 00:06:16,510
think in some ways it continues to

00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:17,860
encourage prototyping you can still if

00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:20,169
parallel wasn't burning your theme you

00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:21,430
can still prototype in there but I think

00:06:20,169 --> 00:06:23,289
it's really easy for people to just

00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:25,060
start hacking away at things in Drupal

00:06:23,289 --> 00:06:26,830
rather than doing lighter-weight

00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:29,460
prototyping and it's kind of more

00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:29,460
encouraged if it's

00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,490
so it's kind of the path of least

00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:34,870
resistance and that's all you know some

00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:36,130
gut feelings that go along with this

00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:37,570
it's always kind of this approach is

00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:40,740
always conceptually felt like the right

00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:43,509
thing even if it wasn't what I was doing

00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:47,199
many in the community whose opinions I

00:06:43,509 --> 00:06:50,919
trust the big bonus there and in theory

00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:53,979
let us reuse this on other web projects

00:06:50,919 --> 00:06:56,710
related to our brand and also it kind of

00:06:53,979 --> 00:06:58,449
felt right for our company so especially

00:06:56,710 --> 00:07:00,880
in our time of growth with some of these

00:06:58,449 --> 00:07:02,830
acquisitions a lot of these are not all

00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:05,050
developers but a number of them are

00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:06,699
front-end developers and some of them

00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:08,320
work with Drupal and some of them don't

00:07:06,699 --> 00:07:10,389
but there's a lot of people who can

00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:13,210
write really great HTML CSS and

00:07:10,389 --> 00:07:16,150
JavaScript in our company so structuring

00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:18,430
things in such a way that our more

00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:22,710
diverse set of skills could contribute

00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:26,349
on the front end was an attractive thing

00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:31,449
so let's talk a little bit about how we

00:07:26,349 --> 00:07:34,840
approached it so in a design system and

00:07:31,449 --> 00:07:41,770
this is using the PHP version of pattern

00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:44,530
lab so we gave the project namespace

00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:47,169
name description and then defined that

00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:48,849
type of design system we just made that

00:07:47,169 --> 00:07:52,539
up it could be whatever we wanted to and

00:07:48,849 --> 00:07:54,250
you see how that's used in a second so

00:07:52,539 --> 00:07:57,310
then would be the composer

00:07:54,250 --> 00:08:00,180
JSON file in the Drupal project in the

00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:03,550
repository section we added our github

00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:06,220
sorry bitbucket repository right next to

00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:09,400
packages that drupal.org so they can be

00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:11,979
aware of that dependency and then in the

00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:14,860
extra section here we added installer

00:08:11,979 --> 00:08:18,520
types of design system and then we can

00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:22,720
define exactly how that a dependency of

00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:25,240
type design system is handled so in this

00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:27,070
particular case we already had a number

00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:28,570
of composer dependencies at the you know

00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:30,940
the root of our project managing the

00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:32,649
Drupal project as a whole I personally

00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:35,110
wanted to avoid having other composer

00:08:32,649 --> 00:08:38,680
dependencies in other places of our

00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:40,659
project that's why we took this approach

00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:43,020
I did find that if in the kind of

00:08:40,659 --> 00:08:45,089
default location for the vendor

00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:48,160
dependencies it was hard to get at

00:08:45,089 --> 00:08:50,290
templates and things so that's why in

00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:52,390
this case copying them to elaborate

00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:54,339
directory in the theme so it's just kind

00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:58,029
of part of the process when we pull in

00:08:54,339 --> 00:08:59,470
the new dependency for future versions

00:08:58,029 --> 00:09:01,270
of patent lab the node version of

00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:03,940
pattern lab going forward might take a

00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:05,410
different approach because you know the

00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:07,420
no dependencies would be separate from

00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:10,029
our project level composer dependencies

00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:11,670
but when we did this project it worked

00:09:10,029 --> 00:09:15,100
nicely

00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:16,600
so Nava allows us to require the design

00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:18,580
system as a dependency so we can go

00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:21,820
composer require and require our design

00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:24,010
system for our pre-launch cycle we

00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:27,700
required it at active because things

00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:30,040
were kind of moving fast and then we can

00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:32,290
run composer updates when we want to

00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:34,330
consume new changes from the design

00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:36,970
system so on the Drupal side we have

00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:38,950
control over that we can decide when we

00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:43,150
want to bring in new things we tagged

00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:45,279
major releases in the design system we

00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:47,220
often did still just require things that

00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:50,080
had but it was helpful to be able to

00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:51,880
look at a specific release or rollback

00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:54,550
to certain releases at different points

00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:58,240
in the process so gives you some control

00:09:54,550 --> 00:10:01,089
there and then incorporate into the

00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:03,040
theme really pretty common

00:10:01,089 --> 00:10:04,000
straightforward stuff here but the

00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:07,089
compiler

00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:10,089
assets are in a global library so we

00:10:07,089 --> 00:10:12,100
have our compiled CSS file a couple of

00:10:10,089 --> 00:10:14,500
JavaScript bundles so that stuff is

00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:17,050
available to our theme now and then

00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:19,600
using our components module defined a

00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:21,370
few twig namespaces a little images

00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,330
shortcut for some image assets that

00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:24,790
we're using in a handful of different

00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:27,250
places and then the kind of different

00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:30,310
levels of our design system not the

00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:33,330
default atomic design naming but in the

00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:39,310
neighborhood so now all that stuff is

00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:41,200
available to our theme so an interesting

00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:44,520
workflow that we kind of fell into

00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:46,230
working on the project we had Sean who

00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:48,960
who

00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:52,290
can dribble but definitely someone who

00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:56,010
is the most efficient just writing good

00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:59,250
CSS javascript in HTML that's CMS

00:10:56,010 --> 00:11:01,500
agnostic so he built out the majority of

00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:05,280
our remaining components in the design

00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:07,770
system and only had two commits in the

00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:09,300
triple repository but he was at the end

00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:12,840
of the day responsible for the bulk of

00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:15,060
our theme and then Wade was kind of the

00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:17,340
middleman handing handling the component

00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:19,620
integration so he was wiring the design

00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:22,950
system components you know doing the

00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:24,360
mapping adding them to layouts the bulk

00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:27,570
of this effort was in the Drupal

00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:29,220
repository but sometimes you would make

00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:31,350
changes in the design system if it's

00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:33,450
maybe something that Drupal needed that

00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:34,440
wasn't accounted for or situations where

00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:38,130
it could make his life a little bit

00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:41,790
easier so that split worked pretty

00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:44,130
nicely we found and then as often

00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:45,900
happens in projects there were some

00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:49,890
interesting bumps along the way some

00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:52,710
changes in scope that having this design

00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:56,280
system as an external dependency opened

00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:59,640
up some interesting options so there was

00:11:56,280 --> 00:12:01,080
the lunar metric site they offer like

00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:04,650
analytics trainings throughout the

00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:06,840
country and they have a place we can go

00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:08,190
register for trainings and sign up and

00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:09,420
it was determined that in the time frame

00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:12,180
that we had we weren't going to be able

00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:13,680
to rebuild the training section of the

00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:15,450
site especially because they added some

00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:17,340
new functionality and new integrations

00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:21,030
and we'd basically be just like dumping

00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:23,490
it and rebuilding it again since we had

00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:24,600
this design system I don't even know

00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:27,420
that we would have been able to consider

00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:29,940
this otherwise we determined that we

00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:31,880
we're going to attempt to keep just the

00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:35,250
training section of their WordPress site

00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:39,470
alive but how that matched the look and

00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:42,150
feel of the rest of our Jubilate build

00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:44,400
so for the actual WordPress integration

00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:46,850
we worked with a company while you had

00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:50,580
creative and they handled the original

00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:52,530
build of the Luna metric site and were

00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:53,820
available to help us reskin it which was

00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:56,610
great because we needed some extra hands

00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:59,250
at that point and they also introduced

00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:59,830
me to the timber plugin which I had

00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:01,900
never

00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:05,830
before which makes it possible to use

00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:07,780
twig in WordPress slogan because

00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:11,740
WordPress is awesome but the loop isn't

00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:19,660
I yeah yeah continue cheering from the

00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:22,090
crowd yes I agree credit and initial

00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:24,670
prototype using timber and our design

00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:27,220
system and used all the components with

00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:29,200
their twig templates in place and it

00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:31,180
allowed them to kind of get a pro tect

00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,860
up and running quickly and kind of prove

00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:35,040
out that it was going to be possible to

00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:38,410
do this rescan and the time that we had

00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:40,570
leading up to the launch especially like

00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:42,850
trying to hit our timeline there was a

00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:45,040
little bit less of the timber use and a

00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:47,170
little bit more traditional theming that

00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:50,770
kind of happened we'll revisit that

00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:53,820
later but this is just a simple example

00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:56,230
of what it might look like so on our

00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:58,360
training page we have a list of upcoming

00:13:56,230 --> 00:14:00,910
trainings and individual like training

00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:03,460
items stacked on top of each other here

00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:05,170
so looking at some of the templates in

00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:09,550
the WordPress complex we've got this

00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:11,260
training module PHP wrapping doing with

00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:13,900
some classes in it and then a for loop

00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:15,640
that just assembles the data that we

00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:18,360
want to pass into this component so we

00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:20,740
get our training element it's not unlike

00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:22,510
you know a render array or some of the

00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:24,040
mapping that we might do in a quick

00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:28,000
template and a Drupal presenter

00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:30,610
templates and then the training element

00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,790
PHP templates is just going to render

00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:36,460
the template from our design system with

00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:38,170
the data that was made available to this

00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:42,580
template so we just render the templates

00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:45,640
and we get the same training item as we

00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:48,340
would expect pretty nice so we at the

00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:49,630
end of the day get a training section

00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:51,820
still on the WordPress site but

00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:54,940
incorporate it into the main menu on our

00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:56,950
Drupal site that has the you know exact

00:14:54,940 --> 00:15:02,260
same look and feel using a lot of the

00:14:56,950 --> 00:15:04,300
same assets all together and then very

00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:05,980
close to launch we also find out find

00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:08,080
out that we would be having some other

00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:09,730
new friends join our company DMACC media

00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:10,809
in Canada

00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:14,529
and never thought it was gonna be

00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:16,329
rebranded as bounteous tat CA because of

00:15:14,529 --> 00:15:18,069
the timeline and for some other reasons

00:15:16,329 --> 00:15:20,050
it was definitely going to be a bit of a

00:15:18,069 --> 00:15:21,670
smaller scale site and it was

00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:23,050
acknowledged that you know some of the

00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:24,519
looking field was going to be different

00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:27,879
but hopefully you know in the same

00:15:24,519 --> 00:15:29,980
neighborhood but still having this

00:15:27,879 --> 00:15:31,779
design system really changed the

00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:33,040
conversation we had a first call to kind

00:15:31,779 --> 00:15:35,410
of get our developers together and I was

00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:37,540
able to say we have this design system

00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:39,639
repository give you access to it

00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:41,679
here's what you know assets are

00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:43,929
available what tools are in there you

00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:46,239
know there's a pattern lab instance and

00:15:43,929 --> 00:15:48,339
they were able to use it how they saw

00:15:46,239 --> 00:15:51,040
fit so they you know reuse some

00:15:48,339 --> 00:15:52,989
important assets you know some of the

00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:55,059
SVG backgrounds and things like that and

00:15:52,989 --> 00:15:57,549
kind of were picking and choosing more

00:15:55,059 --> 00:16:00,249
Alucard different classes and and

00:15:57,549 --> 00:16:05,980
structure and things like that allowed

00:16:00,249 --> 00:16:09,369
them to skin this site really quickly so

00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:11,529
we did it we made our intended was

00:16:09,369 --> 00:16:13,629
November 5th launch date and we had all

00:16:11,529 --> 00:16:15,749
of our sites under the bounteous

00:16:13,629 --> 00:16:19,689
look-and-feel using the design system

00:16:15,749 --> 00:16:25,360
everybody took a nap and then we moved

00:16:19,689 --> 00:16:28,179
on post launch so I was kind of

00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:30,040
transitioning off of the day to day and

00:16:28,179 --> 00:16:32,860
other developers were coming on to help

00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:35,559
out and maintain Kyle and Steve were

00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:39,790
some folks who were involved or beyond

00:16:35,559 --> 00:16:43,509
and so at this point the WordPress sites

00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:45,129
are definitely changing less a little

00:16:43,509 --> 00:16:47,589
bit more of just a maintenance thing and

00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:49,240
the new functionality and the the new

00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:53,499
tickets are definitely focused on new

00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:55,899
things on the Drupal 8 site so for new

00:16:53,499 --> 00:16:58,269
people coming on board especially their

00:16:55,899 --> 00:16:59,679
day-to-day is Drupal you know putting

00:16:58,269 --> 00:17:01,059
words in their mouths a little bit but I

00:16:59,679 --> 00:17:02,559
think there was a little bit of the

00:17:01,059 --> 00:17:03,879
feeling of white why can't I just drew

00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:06,250
poll why do I have to make my commits in

00:17:03,879 --> 00:17:08,380
the design system and pull that

00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:09,850
dependency down and again you know I

00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:13,089
expect to just be able to look in the

00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:16,240
theme there so some lessons learned from

00:17:13,089 --> 00:17:18,880
that is that the documentation is

00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,970
important I you know had documentation

00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:22,039
and the readme

00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:24,799
on confluence but I think a thing that

00:17:22,039 --> 00:17:27,380
was missed that could have helped was

00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:29,210
getting into the why even in the the

00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:31,309
documentation a little bit beyond just

00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:33,110
the how so explaining what some of the

00:17:31,309 --> 00:17:35,179
advantages are why we took this approach

00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:36,860
and potentially even some of the

00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:38,929
disadvantages I think that would have

00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:41,510
made it a little bit easier for people

00:17:38,929 --> 00:17:44,809
to come on board and then one thing that

00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:46,850
I wasn't about to take on before people

00:17:44,809 --> 00:17:50,059
start rolling on and off was improving

00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:52,130
the workflow a little bit so you know

00:17:50,059 --> 00:17:53,990
now that we were making smaller scale

00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:56,030
changes and a little bit more focused on

00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:57,860
Drupal we see need to improve the

00:17:56,030 --> 00:18:00,230
workforce was easier to experiment

00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:02,179
inside of Drupal without having to like

00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:04,159
make commits in the design system first

00:18:02,179 --> 00:18:06,830
and pull them down to take a look at it

00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:08,720
so nothing real all that complicated

00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:09,830
here but some gulp tasks that just made

00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,200
that a little bit easier to experiment

00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:13,940
see things how I looked and how things

00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:15,620
looked in Drupal and then commit that

00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:17,330
back to the design system and pull it in

00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:20,570
you know in the traditional build

00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:22,309
process it does definitely add some

00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:25,669
overhead there's there's you know

00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:29,179
potentially a cost here and then it's

00:18:25,669 --> 00:18:31,490
over and wow this was a challenge in

00:18:29,179 --> 00:18:33,950
some cases it definitely was a positive

00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:36,559
one from my perspective the lines

00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:38,450
between the CMS's started to blur a

00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:40,280
little bit here so you know like we

00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:43,520
changed the hover style for those

00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:46,159
training items that we saw before and

00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:47,990
people would expect that to appear in

00:18:46,159 --> 00:18:50,240
both places and you make that change

00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:52,610
once and it would just work everywhere

00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:55,549
but the training site was in WordPress

00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:57,230
and as I mentioned there were some cases

00:18:55,549 --> 00:18:58,610
where we took a little bit more of a

00:18:57,230 --> 00:19:02,120
traditional approach to be able to get

00:18:58,610 --> 00:19:05,150
things out the door so Chrisman working

00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:07,039
on QA and John our kind of marketing the

00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:08,330
guy who is an air quotes because he gets

00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:10,970
his hands dirty on the WordPress site

00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:15,140
secretly sometimes sold them out on this

00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:16,340
talk but they expected the change to

00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:18,080
apply everywhere so what we did

00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:20,340
following the pressure of the launch is

00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:22,110
load on more of

00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:25,110
the timbre approach made it a little bit

00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:27,150
easier to pull in the assets and

00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:32,850
dependencies in the design system in the

00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:35,520
WordPress site as well so you may be

00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:38,000
asking yourself at this point what

00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:40,200
approach you should take in the future

00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,580
you probably know where this is going

00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:45,419
that there definitely is not a

00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:47,970
one-size-fits-all opinion there no real

00:19:45,419 --> 00:19:50,640
answer but your needs might be different

00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:55,080
right this might gonna make sense for

00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:57,029
everybody so the robot site they did a

00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:59,490
great blog post on their recent rebuild

00:19:57,029 --> 00:20:02,429
and they have a podcast episode that

00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:04,020
goes into detail on it and now you know

00:20:02,429 --> 00:20:05,549
have a different company make up a

00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:08,309
different focus they all wanted to be

00:20:05,549 --> 00:20:12,690
able to have you know a group of amazing

00:20:08,309 --> 00:20:14,460
drupal experts to be able to do as much

00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:16,710
you know traditional drupal and take

00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:19,350
advantage of that experience as possible

00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:24,210
so they tried to focus on using as much

00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:26,610
you know core and common contrib etc so

00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:30,419
for a case like what about maybe this

00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:32,640
approach doesn't make as much sense and

00:20:30,419 --> 00:20:34,260
other things to consider when trying to

00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,929
figure out you know where where to put

00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:38,190
your mayo and mustard is if there's

00:20:36,929 --> 00:20:39,480
gonna be valuing reusing these

00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:41,279
components there are certainly going to

00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:42,809
be situations where maybe they really

00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:47,279
aren't going to be used outside of this

00:20:42,809 --> 00:20:49,230
one particular build you know especially

00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:51,600
from this experience sometimes it's hard

00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:53,039
to know for sure I really didn't know

00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:55,620
that that was going to be as important

00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:59,070
as it was going into this project and

00:20:55,620 --> 00:21:01,549
then again the prototyping end of its

00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:04,649
you know I think that having things

00:21:01,549 --> 00:21:06,419
separated and not quite as tied into the

00:21:04,649 --> 00:21:08,250
theme makes it a little bit easier and

00:21:06,419 --> 00:21:10,169
lower resistance to prototype so it can

00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:11,760
encourage that a little bit more and

00:21:10,169 --> 00:21:14,220
then also potentially you know if you're

00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:16,110
looking to publish your design system or

00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:17,520
style guide independently there were

00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:20,370
potentially some advantages from having

00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:22,409
that separate as well and then there's

00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:25,770
also you know your general workflow and

00:21:22,409 --> 00:21:27,059
your team makeup to consider so you know

00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:28,649
as this approach can fit nicely into

00:21:27,059 --> 00:21:31,860
your workflow or could it be easily

00:21:28,649 --> 00:21:34,920
adjusted to allow it and then

00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:38,790
would allow more people to contribute as

00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:40,590
well and again well it's not a

00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:43,110
one-size-fits-all solution I think it

00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:44,520
did work nicely for us and again I'm

00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:47,549
hoping that going forward it's gonna

00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:49,260
allow folks who can do great front-end

00:21:47,549 --> 00:21:51,860
work to contribute to our website which

00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:56,610
i think is a good thing for our company

00:21:51,860 --> 00:22:00,450
and yeah pretty much that's one other

00:21:56,610 --> 00:22:01,799
thing to mention a plugin session but

00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:04,470
also another thing that we're thinking

00:22:01,799 --> 00:22:07,110
about on a project that I'm working on

00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:09,720
right now is we have a like

00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:12,000
progressively two coupled sites and we

00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:13,140
have you know styles and even some

00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,710
components that are going to be in

00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:19,290
common between Drupal and react looking

00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:21,690
at ways that we can can do this so one

00:22:19,290 --> 00:22:24,929
thing that we've been looking at in the

00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:26,429
CSS and j/s space is CSS modules and

00:22:24,929 --> 00:22:28,020
that offers some interesting

00:22:26,429 --> 00:22:32,040
possibilities as far as being able to

00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:35,040
use the same partials that go into maybe

00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:37,650
a fully compiled stylesheet that's used

00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:40,679
in Drupal but can also be pulled in on a

00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:41,520
component by component basis in react so

00:22:40,679 --> 00:22:43,260
it's definitely something that we're

00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:45,900
exploring is pretty interesting and John

00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:48,000
Alvin has talked tomorrow on his

00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:50,210
experience with CSS module is an

00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:54,799
overview of some CSS and J's solutions

00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:59,070
it's an interesting talk so check it out

00:22:54,799 --> 00:23:00,840
that is pretty much it I cannot believe

00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:03,929
it but I do have time for questions if

00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:05,250
anybody has questions and if you don't

00:23:03,929 --> 00:23:07,919
that's cool - we made it to the end of

00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:09,390
the day I hands in the back if you guys

00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:11,900
could come up and use the mics that

00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:11,900
would be amazing

00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:22,440
thank you I also want everyone to get

00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:24,630
exercise okay so it sounds like this

00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:27,320
method of making your pattern library

00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:29,760
and external dependency is really

00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:31,799
excellent if you're sharing a pattern

00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:35,280
library between multiple projects yes

00:23:31,799 --> 00:23:39,809
yes and perhaps less useful if you're

00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:41,580
not any in general yes yeah I mean that

00:23:39,809 --> 00:23:44,070
was that it's more useful if it's a

00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:44,790
sense time shared between projects and

00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:49,110
less use

00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:50,280
if it's not that is true there are still

00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:51,600
potentially some advantages and

00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:55,020
conceptually it feels like the right

00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:59,160
thing but yeah okay thank you very much

00:23:55,020 --> 00:24:01,350
you're welcome great talk

00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:02,970
Oh what would you do differently if you

00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:05,640
were to start you know in hindsight

00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:07,980
after going through all of all of this

00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:10,410
stuff in practice start from scratch

00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:12,060
brand-new project clean slate what would

00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:15,480
you do differently or where do you see

00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:19,620
this kind of going next it is an awesome

00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:21,780
question I think that you know again

00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:23,160
time lines make it hard but I would have

00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:25,020
tried to get everyone to stick to our

00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:27,420
guns a little bit more on the WordPress

00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:30,270
side and really use the same components

00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:33,930
as much as we can so we didn't have to

00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:37,110
refactor that afterwards and in general

00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:39,750
do you think we found a really nice kind

00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:41,250
of workflow but we had to kind of

00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:43,350
discover it with that particular team

00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:46,650
makeup so something that still is always

00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:48,840
a pain point for me is the right way to

00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:50,870
handle the integration and the mapping

00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:54,360
between the design system and Drupal and

00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:56,700
there's a lot of ways to do it but it's

00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:59,700
always a little bit of feeling around in

00:24:56,700 --> 00:25:02,130
the dark still for us and the more that

00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:03,300
could be kind of a lockdown approach and

00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:05,280
the more tools that could help us with

00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:07,800
that the better so I think there's a lot

00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:23,820
of opportunity there too I agree awesome

00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:26,730
thanks did you come across that type of

00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:36,750
use case do you have suggestions for how

00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:38,550
to get within yes so the question was

00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:39,540
they have a project where they want to

00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:41,040
be able to see an instance of the

00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:43,500
pattern lab online somewhere where

00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:47,160
people can see it there's a handful of

00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:48,660
ways to do that so powder lab can be

00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:51,060
used as essentially a black site

00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:53,040
generator create a static build of the

00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:54,990
pattern lab that you can then pretty

00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:57,330
much toast anywhere so if you have a

00:25:54,990 --> 00:25:58,010
place that can host the static build of

00:25:57,330 --> 00:25:59,600
pattern lab

00:25:58,010 --> 00:26:00,980
put it up on there that you could put it

00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:05,060
on something like github pages if you

00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:07,670
need to alternatively in the case where

00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:09,170
you do embed pattern lab in a Drupal

00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:12,230
theme if that makes sense for your

00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:13,940
project you can actually access it there

00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:15,800
potentially because it's in your theme

00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:19,460
as well so that's another potential

00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:21,140
approach but it can build for you the

00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:36,230
static version of pattern lab and you

00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:37,910
can post it pretty much anywhere it

00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:39,830
definitely should be possible I mean it

00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:42,680
kind of depends a little bit on the rest

00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:48,830
of your build process but it should be

00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:51,650
doable thank you Thanks Thanks

00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:54,530
appreciate the topics how were you

00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:56,270
handling releases release notes versions

00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:58,310
like hey you know because it's it's

00:26:56,270 --> 00:27:00,830
there's a lot about being like hey let's

00:26:58,310 --> 00:27:03,020
launch it but then what happens after

00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:05,360
yep and so I'd like to hear some of the

00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:06,470
things that you did and also a little

00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:09,170
bit of things that you wish you did as

00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:11,030
well yeah I mean is that how you're

00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:12,260
handling releases inversions is not as

00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:16,700
well as we should have

00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:18,980
so that's kind of a big gap and we

00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:21,980
weren't still tagging releases but

00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:26,110
definitely we're not as as you know

00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:29,180
formal with consuming them and the

00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:30,590
design system itself mostly kind of

00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:32,840
served as the documentation so we didn't

00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:34,640
have like good patch notes or anything I

00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:39,620
would say in general that that's

00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:41,300
probably a area of failure for us and I

00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:43,220
think we just need to be more rigid

00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:46,190
about it we need to tag releases and

00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:47,480
it's fine to have a lot of releases and

00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:49,100
be a little bit more strict about what

00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:53,630
gets pulled in on the Drupal side as a

00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:55,400
dependency so a great answer

00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:59,030
I agree that it's important yeah great

00:27:55,400 --> 00:28:02,510
and then a second question with timber

00:27:59,030 --> 00:28:05,200
any kind of gotchas that you came across

00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:05,200
that you want to share

00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:16,370
I mean not a ton so one thing that into

00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:18,380
is that the the timber module they made

00:28:16,370 --> 00:28:20,240
some major updates recently and are

00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:22,010
basically like stay on the old version

00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:24,620
we're kind of find by the seat of our

00:28:22,010 --> 00:28:27,730
pants on the new one they actually like

00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:33,320
disabled the update link in the the

00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:35,480
plugins page so mostly that but aside

00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:37,070
from that I found it pretty easy and

00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:40,000
reliable that's great to hear

00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:40,000
awesome thanks for sharing

00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:47,900
