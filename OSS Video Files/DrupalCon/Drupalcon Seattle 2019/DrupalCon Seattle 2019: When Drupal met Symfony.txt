Title: DrupalCon Seattle 2019: When Drupal met Symfony
Publication date: 2019-04-12
Playlist: Drupalcon Seattle 2019
Description: 
	Want to see new ways to take full advantage of Drupal using Symfony Components? This is for you! As a non-Drupal developer who works with Symfony Framework for years I'm trying to bring communities together by showing Drupal developers the power of the Symfony components available in Drupal and to show Symfony Framework developers that Drupal can also do the things they are used to work with. This session is about a journey to a completely alternative way to create a Restful API without using any of the well known modules. Don't be afraid to let go of the drupalisms you know and love...

This session is aimed at backend developers who haveÂ a basic understanding of dependency injection and routing.

At the end of this session you will:

know the different between Symfony Components and Symfony Framework
understand how event subscribers can add powerful functionality to your application
know how Symfony components can improve your workflows
and how this can attract non-Drupal developers to help on Drupal projects
know how to create controllers as services and why this is useful
know how you can configure controllers with annotations
have a basic understanding of Symfony Form
learn about the new dependency injection auto-wiring feature
be excited to try everything yourself!
