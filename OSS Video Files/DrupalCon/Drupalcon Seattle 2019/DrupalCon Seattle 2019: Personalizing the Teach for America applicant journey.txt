Title: DrupalCon Seattle 2019: Personalizing the Teach for America applicant journey
Publication date: 2019-04-12
Playlist: Drupalcon Seattle 2019
Description: 
	Teach for America’s (TFA) site seeks to convey TFA’s mission, describe their approach and theory of change and start the application process for people interested in joining the corps. For applicants, there is also a logged-in experience for a rigorous online application process that unfolds over a period of several months.

During this session, DrupalCon participants will learn how TFA reimagined and redesigned its website with the goal of providing users personalized information about the state of their application and links to quickly rejoin the process at the appropriate stage. When TFA kicked off this work its .org site and the application site were wholly separate. Adding to the personalization challenge, applicants are placed in one of 51 school districts across the country, each with its own education system, character, and set of issues.  Working with an outside partner, Blue State Digital, on a tight deadline, TFA began the project with a complete overhaul of the user experience.

The following outlines the process of the project and key takeaways for audience members:

We used atomic design, leveraging Pattern Lab, to standardize the look and feel across the .org and the application sites — while making sure both were beautiful.

We migrated the .org from Drupal 7 to Drupal 8, and in the process consolidated content from 50+ regional websites into a single site.

We implemented single sign-on to streamline the experience for users as they move between information resources on the .org site (Drupal) and the application process site (built in Java).

From this base, we were able to implement personalization in the .org site to continuously communicate where the user is in the application process. For example, since the application and vetting process can span several months, an application returning to TeachForAmerica.org will receive a notification on the homepage of any upcoming deadlines at their particular stage in the process. By integrating with TFA’s other systems when a user logged in, we could determine how the user was connected to TFA and, if an applicant, where they were in the application process. We then used that information to render content for that user type on the front-end (eg.a button that says “Join Today” and links to the registration form for a brand-new visitor might read “Continue Application” and link to the applicant center for a user who is in the middle of the application process).. We combined this with a custom entity type so that content editors could easily update the personalized content without needing to make a code change.

Importantly all of the above was accomplished through a close working relationship between TFA’s developers and Blue State Digital.  This session will be co-presented with Teach For America and Blue State Digital.

	00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:03,689
we're really excited to be talking about

00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:05,600
a partnership that we have between Teach

00:00:03,689 --> 00:00:07,710
for America and blue state digital and

00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:09,599
we are going to be talking about

00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:14,849
personalizing the Teach for America

00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:16,830
applicant journey and my name is sim and

00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:18,750
I'm a product manager a non technical

00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:22,939
product manager at Teach for America

00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:26,640
I've been there for about eight years

00:00:22,939 --> 00:00:29,220
right before I started that I was down

00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:32,579
the road in Seattle at an agency called

00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:35,550
blink interactive and i'm andrea powell

00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:37,320
i am a UX designer at a digital agency

00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:39,390
called blue state digital we're based in

00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:42,920
new york although we have offices around

00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:46,079
the country and we focus on fundraising

00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:48,090
engagement and website and platform

00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:51,449
builds for organizations that are

00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:55,140
mission driven so thank you all for

00:00:51,449 --> 00:01:00,149
being here during this sleepy lunch of

00:00:55,140 --> 00:01:02,160
the day we really appreciate it okay so

00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:03,870
I think the most appropriate way to

00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,769
start out the story is with the mission

00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:08,700
of Teach for America

00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:11,250
so TFA seeks to end educational inequity

00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:13,740
by recruiting recent college grads and

00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:18,060
professionals to become teachers for two

00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:20,820
years in low-income communities and many

00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:22,200
of those teachers stay on in the

00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:25,170
classroom after their two years are up

00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:27,979
and many pursue other careers that are

00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:30,990
in adjacent sectors that still have

00:01:27,979 --> 00:01:32,970
impacts in the community tackling the

00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:34,680
same problem of inequity so whether

00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:37,500
you're doctor whether you're a lawyer

00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:38,880
whether you go into tech leadership you

00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,710
will have that experience in the

00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,570
classroom as kind of the baseline for

00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:44,610
everything that you do in your career in

00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:47,009
the future and that is how Teach for

00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:50,100
America describes its mission and how we

00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:53,610
operate and just to give you a sense of

00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:56,969
scale the program is very competitive so

00:01:53,610 --> 00:02:00,719
this year we had 56,000 applicants and

00:01:56,969 --> 00:02:05,119
from that we expect about 3,500 teachers

00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:05,119
all across the u.s. this year

00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,010
so as you can probably guess we have a

00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:15,460
pretty complex application for somebody

00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:17,800
joining the Corps it's both complex in

00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:21,940
terms of mindset so what we're asking

00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:23,680
people to do is pretty hard it is also a

00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:27,370
complicated application in terms of the

00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:28,810
number of steps and the platform setup

00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:30,880
is complicated as well so I'm gonna be

00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:35,080
talking about each of those difficult

00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:40,000
challenges so first of all in terms of

00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:42,700
mindset so without being offensive to

00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,850
anyone who has an e-commerce site out

00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:49,600
there what we're asking people to do are

00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:53,230
is reorient their life to a life of

00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:55,390
impact and that is our sales funnel and

00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:58,450
so the things that come with that are

00:02:55,390 --> 00:03:00,940
pretty challenging so first of all we're

00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:03,820
asking people to potentially move in to

00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:07,450
move to a new place we're asking them to

00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:08,950
do a big long application and send us a

00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:11,080
lot of their personal info so we can do

00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:13,480
background checks and so ultimately they

00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:15,700
can interview in a school district and

00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:19,660
in school and get placed in that school

00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:21,700
so our performance indicators on our

00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:23,830
website are the number of people who

00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:26,200
register on the site and the number of

00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:28,330
people who submit applications the

00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:30,519
people who show up at first day of

00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:33,310
school and then ultimately the people

00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:35,110
who have long lasting impact beyond

00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:37,570
their two years in the classrooms those

00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:43,360
are kind of our key performance

00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:46,799
indicators so getting a little bit into

00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:50,290
more detail about the platform set up so

00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:54,420
this is the old state we were on Drupal

00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:56,950
7 now we're on Drupal 8 and the

00:03:54,420 --> 00:04:00,580
participant would sign up for an account

00:03:56,950 --> 00:04:03,489
on Drupal and through a bit of a service

00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:05,829
that information they signed up with

00:04:03,489 --> 00:04:07,390
gets sent over to the Teach for America

00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:12,670
application which is a separate

00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:14,830
application built in Java and then the

00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:16,359
participant would do things that you

00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:19,000
would normally expect in an application

00:04:16,359 --> 00:04:21,100
like uploading transcripts fill

00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:27,130
now short answer questions doing some

00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:28,690
essays and if they are to be moved

00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:32,650
forward to the next steps they do an

00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:35,530
in-person interview ultimately if they

00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:38,920
are accepted they'll be hired by a

00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:41,200
school district and eventually attend

00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:46,720
day one in school so it's a pretty long

00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:48,580
funnel lots of area for friction lots of

00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:53,380
places where people could potentially

00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:55,990
drop out of the funnel so we had quite a

00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:57,790
challenge and what part of this

00:04:55,990 --> 00:05:01,840
challenge is that because the

00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:04,240
application was a Java app and because

00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,740
we were on Drupal 7 they were sort of

00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,960
separate system that weren't talking to

00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:10,240
each other so that was like a challenge

00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:13,210
when someone was visiting the public

00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:15,370
site it didn't have a personalized

00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:16,450
experience that was reflecting what we

00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:17,950
already knew about them because they

00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:20,470
already filled out their application and

00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:23,169
they already gave us some of their

00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:24,100
information and we know where where

00:05:23,169 --> 00:05:26,229
they're progressing through the

00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:28,060
application but the public site had no

00:05:26,229 --> 00:05:32,620
notion of that so that's one of the

00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:35,050
things we were hoping to fix second

00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:37,390
thing is we wanted to really provide a

00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:41,260
better sense of progress so if you can

00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:44,490
see here the UI element at the top was a

00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:50,860
progress bar that wasn't doing it

00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:54,070
justice quite quite as we wanted to and

00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:56,979
as I was saying before even if you are

00:05:54,070 --> 00:06:00,250
logged in in the old experience there

00:05:56,979 --> 00:06:02,440
wasn't sort of a reflection that we knew

00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:04,870
who you were that TFA like already has

00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:07,780
your information and we know something

00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:11,110
about what you're experiencing inside of

00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:14,460
the application so that was something we

00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:14,460
were also hoping to fix

00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:24,020
in addition TFA operates in 51 different

00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:27,440
regions and as you can imagine teaching

00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:29,750
in an inner-city school district in New

00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:32,000
York for example is much different than

00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:36,170
teaching on a reservation in New Mexico

00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:38,090
so we wanted a space where these 51

00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:40,250
independent regions could tell the story

00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:44,180
about their impacts in ways that were

00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:47,270
meaningful to that region but also were

00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:49,510
sort of connected in a sense to the

00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:53,500
larger grand story of Teach for America

00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:57,620
by giving it like a common thread and

00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:59,120
this this would only serve to help those

00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:05,540
people who are applying to Teach for

00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:07,550
America so at this point that's sort of

00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:12,440
the problem space that we were operating

00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:14,810
in and at this moment in time we kind of

00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:18,740
kicked it over to blue state digital and

00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:21,470
said here are goals good luck with that

00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:24,470
and we partnered with them throughout

00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:26,690
the process to build the new experience

00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:28,190
which Andrea is going to be talking

00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:30,860
about a little bit yeah

00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:33,380
so one of the challenges that we were

00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:36,020
dealing with in addition to the digital

00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:39,350
spaces that you just saw was the

00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:41,960
timeline so we started this project in

00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:44,990
this redesign in the spring of last year

00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:46,670
so a little bit over a year ago and it

00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:49,520
had to be up and running and ready to go

00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:53,090
by the time the next application cycle

00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:55,010
started in the fall so it was a pretty

00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:58,190
ambitious asks so one of the first

00:07:55,010 --> 00:08:00,560
things we had to do was to really

00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:01,720
strictly prioritize what are most

00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:05,360
important

00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:09,470
experience things that we need to fix in

00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:11,900
order to in order to update this system

00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:14,780
of platforms in a way that would help

00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:18,650
those applicants have a more seamless

00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:20,750
and more useful experience so we kind of

00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:23,360
brought it down to about three main

00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:24,980
goals the first was you know just

00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,780
stating the obvious we wanted to make it

00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:28,100
feel like all of these different

00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:29,630
websites and

00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:31,550
forms felt like that they were part of

00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:32,750
the same entity or that at the very

00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:36,140
least that they were representing the

00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:39,260
same organization so fleshing out the

00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:41,030
visual system updating it and making

00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:42,650
sure that it was being applied

00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:45,770
consistently across all these different

00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:47,060
sites another bit of feedback that the

00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:49,760
Teach for America team had been

00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:52,040
gathering for some time was the idea

00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:54,650
that a lot of people who come in to join

00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:57,950
the Corps are not always completely

00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:59,270
aware of all of the nuances and

00:08:57,950 --> 00:09:01,880
challenges of going through the

00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:03,530
application and training process just

00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:05,570
because there's so much detail about

00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:07,520
what they're going to have to do we

00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:09,500
wanted to take the information that was

00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:12,760
already being provided fill in any gaps

00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:14,930
and just make it as clear as possible

00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:16,850
what they're going to need to be doing

00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:19,910
at each stage of the user journey and

00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:21,890
then finally we really narrowed our

00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:25,010
focus again as we've been saying to

00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:28,580
applicants as our primary audience group

00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:31,790
because they are the ones that are going

00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:34,520
to be joining the Corps this is the the

00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:36,230
best way to improve the experience for

00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:37,430
all corps members is to start with their

00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:40,390
first interactions with Teach for

00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:42,500
America and also this is where the

00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:44,660
digital platforms are going to have the

00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:46,670
most impact on that experience versus

00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:50,350
once I get into the classroom where it's

00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:53,140
really about the in-person interactions

00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:56,030
so I'm going to talk about the design

00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:57,470
stream and then kick it back over to sim

00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:58,880
to talk about the technical solutions

00:09:57,470 --> 00:10:02,450
that we are a technical approach that we

00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:05,000
took so as I mentioned earlier the first

00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:08,210
thing was to update the visual system to

00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:10,250
take TFA's branding make it feel a

00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:12,530
little bit more more modern and make

00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:14,330
sure that it was expandable enough to be

00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:17,060
able to grow with Teach for America over

00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:19,280
time since they are attempting to tackle

00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:22,490
the very large problem of educational

00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:24,080
inequity around the country there their

00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:26,210
work is always growing so we wanted to

00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:29,990
make sure this this visual system could

00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:31,430
grow with them and we wanted to see if

00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:33,860
there are opportunities to simplify the

00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:35,930
actual number of steps that users have

00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:38,780
to go through in the application before

00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:41,329
we started trying to you to go to design

00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:42,709
solutions we were able to do that

00:10:41,329 --> 00:10:44,869
little bit but I'm not going to talk

00:10:42,709 --> 00:10:48,110
about that very much because it was very

00:10:44,869 --> 00:10:50,209
much very much limited by the types of

00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:53,509
educational requirements that are

00:10:50,209 --> 00:10:54,920
existent across the 50 states so there's

00:10:53,509 --> 00:10:59,059
only so much we could do with the actual

00:10:54,920 --> 00:11:02,619
steps of the application next we wanted

00:10:59,059 --> 00:11:05,269
to find more ways to provide

00:11:02,619 --> 00:11:07,730
personalized targeted action prompts

00:11:05,269 --> 00:11:09,499
that reflected what we knew about that

00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:12,829
user and where they were in the

00:11:09,499 --> 00:11:14,569
application process and then also just

00:11:12,829 --> 00:11:16,279
to again kind of reinforce the

00:11:14,569 --> 00:11:18,860
information about what the process was

00:11:16,279 --> 00:11:22,730
going to be like by providing a more

00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:24,439
nuanced set of reminders of where they

00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:26,449
were in the process what was still

00:11:24,439 --> 00:11:29,600
coming up and to help help them get

00:11:26,449 --> 00:11:32,739
ready earlier on as I started their

00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:36,829
application so here's the grand reveal

00:11:32,739 --> 00:11:38,629
these are the two two primary parts of

00:11:36,829 --> 00:11:42,069
the experience the main public site and

00:11:38,629 --> 00:11:46,790
the application center so as you'll see

00:11:42,069 --> 00:11:49,220
we so in updating the visual system we

00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:50,959
were able to kind of give a lot of cues

00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:53,329
across these two different platforms

00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:55,519
that you were again in a space

00:11:53,329 --> 00:11:57,949
represented by the same organization we

00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:00,649
were able to make the navigation

00:11:57,949 --> 00:12:02,869
consistent so that it was more seamless

00:12:00,649 --> 00:12:04,790
as you're going from one site to the

00:12:02,869 --> 00:12:07,100
next and it felt more like you're part

00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:08,869
of the same experience clearly our our

00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:11,329
typographic system and our color system

00:12:08,869 --> 00:12:12,679
is consistent across both but one thing

00:12:11,329 --> 00:12:15,110
that we came to as we were starting to

00:12:12,679 --> 00:12:18,860
work on all these platforms was that we

00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:20,689
still wanted the logged in space the

00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:23,569
application center in this instance to

00:12:20,689 --> 00:12:26,980
feel like something special so we did

00:12:23,569 --> 00:12:30,199
look to find ways to build out clear

00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:32,269
visual differences between the two again

00:12:30,199 --> 00:12:35,059
without without breaking that idea of

00:12:32,269 --> 00:12:36,910
the connection in the same entity so the

00:12:35,059 --> 00:12:39,889
public site was really focused on

00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:42,139
photography on a bold typographic

00:12:39,889 --> 00:12:44,660
statements whereas the application

00:12:42,139 --> 00:12:47,419
center it was supposed to feel like more

00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:49,189
of a a detailed kind of private space

00:12:47,419 --> 00:12:50,809
where you're working you're getting your

00:12:49,189 --> 00:12:53,899
work done and you are progressing

00:12:50,809 --> 00:12:54,860
through a more detailed set of pages so

00:12:53,899 --> 00:12:58,460
it's more

00:12:54,860 --> 00:13:01,130
just on graphic elements and typography

00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:06,050
and not really bringing in much

00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:08,810
photography also we came to the

00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:11,180
realization through working on these 51

00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:12,730
regional micro sites that it actually

00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:14,840
from kind of a higher level

00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:17,930
architectural standpoint would make more

00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:19,910
sense if they were rather than separate

00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:23,150
individual microsites if they felt more

00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:26,180
like detail pages and sections within

00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:28,820
the main site itself so this would allow

00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:30,980
us to again ensure consistency across

00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:32,570
all of them you'll see they have the

00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:33,710
same navigation as the rest of the site

00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:35,840
it may look a little bit different

00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:37,310
because this is the scroll down state

00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:39,710
but they all have the same navigation

00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:41,600
and matches the rest of the site they

00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:43,280
are located in a section of the main

00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:46,820
public site rather than scattered on

00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:48,890
their own micro sites and we were able

00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:50,630
to systematize the content and the

00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:52,580
subsections a little bit more so you see

00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:56,120
the same four subsections under each

00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:57,350
state and each region name and this way

00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:01,010
we were making sure that each of the

00:13:57,350 --> 00:14:03,260
regions were providing a similar you

00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:04,790
know comparing similar types of

00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:07,520
information across all these different

00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:09,650
sections so then we ended up needing to

00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:11,450
rely a lot more on the photography on on

00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:14,540
these landing pages to really do that

00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:17,840
work of demonstrating kind of the

00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:19,190
individual character of each of the

00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:20,840
different regions where Teach for

00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:23,270
America works so we really leaned into

00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:25,820
that beautiful photography to do that

00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:30,080
work for us on these on these new

00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:31,610
sections so just a moment on the

00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:35,270
navigation one thing I wanted to pull

00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:37,460
out in more detail was that we also were

00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:39,710
doing a lot of the work of kind of

00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:43,040
organizing the information that we were

00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:44,360
providing on the public site using the

00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:47,450
two different levels that you see here

00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:49,340
in the navigation so in the main line on

00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:51,230
the bottom close to the close to the

00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:53,690
logo we trimmed down the main sections

00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:55,880
of the site to just the three main

00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:58,160
stages of the Teach for America core

00:14:55,880 --> 00:15:00,710
experience which is how to join that's

00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:02,360
the application life in the core those

00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:04,160
that's the training that goes into your

00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:05,810
first year teaching and then your two

00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:07,850
years in the classroom and then life as

00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:08,550
an alum what does it like to be part of

00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:13,440
this community

00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:14,820
of educators for everything else so we

00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:17,670
had some other secondary audiences

00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:19,740
outside of applicants we had people who

00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:21,030
might choose to be a local partner in

00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:23,700
one of these regions where Teach for

00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:28,290
America works you have people who want

00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:29,670
to find ways to get involved and also

00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:31,440
just members of the general public who

00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:35,550
want to understand what the mission is

00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:37,290
so we kept this information still in the

00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:38,670
navigation still easy to find but we

00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:41,490
really wanted to make sure that it

00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:44,250
wasn't distracting from the information

00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:46,440
that an applicant would need and we

00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:47,670
really wanted to give them space in the

00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:49,250
navigation to be able to find the

00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:51,660
information that was relevant to them

00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:52,800
and we were okay with having everyone

00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:54,390
else have to dig a little bit more

00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:57,420
because because it was most important to

00:15:54,390 --> 00:16:00,060
get applicants their information and

00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:03,690
speaking of personalization as Sam was

00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:06,600
mentioning earlier we also really leaned

00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:10,020
into this idea of a CTA button that

00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:13,170
would change its language depending on

00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:15,990
where you were in the process so if you

00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:17,850
are just a new visitor it's trying to

00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:20,310
encourage you to apply to join to the

00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:24,120
court and if you're in the middle of the

00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:26,100
application it could shift to reflect

00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:30,510
some of the key deadlines that are

00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:32,640
coming up and it would stay ever-present

00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:35,310
I even as you're scrolling down the page

00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:37,140
and the navigation gets a little bit a

00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:40,020
little bit smaller as you can see up at

00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:42,600
the top so this is what the full

00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:44,550
homepage looks like as you can see from

00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:47,090
top to bottom again we're really leaning

00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:49,770
into the storytelling aspect of

00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:52,560
positioning what problems Teach for

00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:56,670
America is attempting to solve and how

00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:59,100
they go about their work we tried to

00:16:56,670 --> 00:17:01,230
pull in other personalization moments

00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:03,240
and calls to action in the denser parts

00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:05,520
of the text so let's say we have a

00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:07,440
detail page on you know who is eligible

00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:09,000
to teach and how do you know if you are

00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:12,980
going to be eligible and should apply

00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:16,830
and we also had these contextual modules

00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:19,740
with the text reflecting you know what

00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:21,350
is them what is the most pending

00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:22,910
application deadline

00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:25,189
could be personalized if you are logged

00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:28,039
in and are already on your way to

00:17:25,189 --> 00:17:30,100
applying to join the course oh so yeah

00:17:28,039 --> 00:17:32,929
we have those kind of bold personalized

00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:34,820
components like the the CTA button and

00:17:32,929 --> 00:17:38,120
then also ones that are deep into the

00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:41,299
text over on the application center this

00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:42,830
is just a zoom in on the dashboard what

00:17:41,299 --> 00:17:47,240
we are calling the the applicant Center

00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:49,880
dashboard so the idea with this is to

00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:53,900
make sure that we are able to kind of

00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:55,730
draw their eye and point them to what

00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:58,760
stage of the application process they're

00:17:55,730 --> 00:18:00,530
in there are four main stages and then

00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:02,809
within that you can see all the

00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:04,640
different steps so we expanded that

00:18:02,809 --> 00:18:06,590
really great timeline that was in the

00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:08,750
original version and just really leaned

00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:11,900
into it so that you know rather than

00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:13,520
just showing the top level let's say six

00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:15,679
most important moments of the

00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:17,390
application process we said let's just

00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:21,110
show them everything we're still going

00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:22,520
to provide those high-level buckets but

00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:24,470
we're going to show you and give you a

00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:26,659
chance to just know what to what to

00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:29,809
expect and also if you can see in the

00:18:26,659 --> 00:18:32,659
the small iconography next to it we have

00:18:29,809 --> 00:18:34,780
pie charts and checkmarks for you to be

00:18:32,659 --> 00:18:36,950
able to see what what you've completed

00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:38,750
or what you still need to complete

00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:41,750
before you can submit that section of

00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:44,419
the application similar to the main part

00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:46,880
of the site we also just made sure to

00:18:44,419 --> 00:18:49,130
have these indicators on the detailed

00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:52,100
pages themselves as well in the form in

00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:55,370
this case of sub navigation and sidebar

00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:58,850
navigation again to show you okay within

00:18:55,370 --> 00:19:00,200
again within your bucket of steps what

00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:01,940
do you still have left to complete so

00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:03,860
we're trying to make sure that the kind

00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:05,470
of the landing pages and the navigation

00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:08,390
and the detail pages are all working

00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:10,970
concurrently to provide you up-to-date

00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:15,830
information about where you are in the

00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:17,240
application process okay so I'm gonna

00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:20,659
talk a little bit about the technical

00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:23,750
approach here and so first of all I

00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:25,640
would just say that in terms of the

00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:28,549
button states that Andrea was talking

00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:31,040
about that was a very simple API call

00:19:28,549 --> 00:19:33,980
from Drupal to the applicant center

00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:34,380
getting sort of where the user is in the

00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:36,300
application

00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:38,670
and presenting that back to Drupal so we

00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:41,670
could customize the button for the

00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:44,190
particular state that the users in in

00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:46,130
terms of technical or in terms of a

00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:49,050
mindset that just required really course

00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:50,670
close collaboration between the

00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:52,290
developers working on the public website

00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:54,630
and the developers working on the

00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:56,160
opposition obviously so that's not so

00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:59,940
much a technical approach as more of a

00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:03,330
mindset as part of this project we also

00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:06,030
went from hosting the site internally at

00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:09,270
TFA and we moved over to Pantheon we

00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:12,540
also in the process shifted from d7 to

00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:14,880
d8 so there was quite a bit of learning

00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:16,980
that happened from a developer

00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:19,290
perspective and actually one of our

00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:22,920
developers is in the audience so she can

00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:27,180
probably speak to that we also developed

00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:30,150
a shared atomic design vocabulary so

00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:32,220
that we could approach this in a way

00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:34,680
that the design worked both for the

00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:38,310
application and 48 and so I'll talk

00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:40,410
about that approach that we used and we

00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:45,540
use pattern lab to do that specifically

00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:50,910
and an Twigg so a little bit of why we

00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:53,760
shifted from d7 to d8 and as we learn

00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:56,160
from keynote this morning we still have

00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:58,350
more than two years of support left on

00:20:56,160 --> 00:21:00,030
d7 but as a little bit of future

00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:02,880
proofing we thought it was a good time

00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:07,140
there's a lot more available out of the

00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:10,770
box with d8 as well we have a definite

00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:13,860
focus on accessibility and that is front

00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:18,600
and center in d8 with quite a few Aria

00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:24,570
attributes for adaptive devices and just

00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:26,430
a lot more available in core so if you

00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:28,620
are not familiar with atomic design the

00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:31,050
principle is really simple it's

00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:32,790
basically just building up to really

00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:36,960
complex things from really simple things

00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:40,020
so you start with things that are atoms

00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:43,890
you build up to molecules you then go

00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:45,930
into organisms and templates and roughly

00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:47,440
speaking a little bit of hand waving

00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:49,149
here but if you're

00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:51,639
thinking about this in the Tripoli way

00:21:49,149 --> 00:21:54,279
templates are sort of like page

00:21:51,639 --> 00:21:57,730
templates organisms are like your

00:21:54,279 --> 00:22:00,909
paragraph components and multiple

00:21:57,730 --> 00:22:03,940
molecules make up organisms and multiple

00:22:00,909 --> 00:22:07,210
atoms make up molecules so to get a

00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:08,950
little bit less abstract there we can

00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:11,019
talk about and you can actually follow

00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:14,110
along if you want our powder in lab is

00:22:11,019 --> 00:22:15,700
public and you can see all the patterns

00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:17,860
that we use there I'll just leave that

00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:21,850
up for a second if you are trying to get

00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:24,250
there but right here on the screen

00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:27,700
those are teach for America's brand

00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:30,580
colors the nice thing about pattern lab

00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:32,559
is very deeply integrated into trouble

00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:34,870
so let's say you wanted to change the

00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:36,789
color of a button you change it in

00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:43,000
pattern lab and it changes everywhere

00:22:36,789 --> 00:22:44,230
across the site so that's really nice so

00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,460
I'll leave that up for one more second

00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:47,460
if people are still trying to get there

00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:55,629
so the atoms are the most basic building

00:22:53,289 --> 00:22:58,149
blocks of the design system you have

00:22:55,629 --> 00:23:00,610
things like a button or a color or a

00:22:58,149 --> 00:23:04,570
text block things that are simple and

00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:07,090
can be described pretty easily next up

00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:09,309
you have molecules which are basically

00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:12,000
combinations of atoms so in this case

00:23:09,309 --> 00:23:15,179
there's a CTA there's some copy and

00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:17,860
there's a link so there's a notion of

00:23:15,179 --> 00:23:21,879
that you're combining atoms to make an

00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:25,360
element here one step up from that is an

00:23:21,879 --> 00:23:28,299
organism so this organism is that modal

00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:30,820
box that we just looked at before and a

00:23:28,299 --> 00:23:35,919
map overlay of teach for America's

00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:38,830
different regions and finally we have

00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:41,379
our templates so in this example there

00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:44,830
is a header there's a footer there's top

00:23:41,379 --> 00:23:48,100
navigation there CTA at the top there

00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:51,070
side navigation there's a text block and

00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:53,460
there's they the region map that we

00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:53,460
showed before

00:23:54,430 --> 00:24:01,000
and there are other sessions about using

00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:02,710
pattern lab I'm not gonna go into whole

00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,030
detail about this but the nice thing is

00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:06,190
that you can see the visual

00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:08,650
representation and for a developer this

00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:13,290
is super nice because then you can see

00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:13,290
the code behind each of the elements

00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:20,710
alright

00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:22,470
so now moving along to our sort of

00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:26,080
takeaways or what we learned about

00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:30,550
moving from d7 to d8 and doing this

00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:34,870
whole project with blue state so I think

00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:38,080
the first thing that we are are proud of

00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:40,600
is that we had fifty-six thousand of

00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:42,460
people people applied to the Corps this

00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:44,470
year which is the second highest

00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:47,220
applicant pool in teach for America's

00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:50,710
history with which is amazing and

00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:53,140
especially because of the headwaters

00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:54,760
we're facing we have a good economy that

00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:59,440
is a really good number of people who

00:24:54,760 --> 00:25:01,540
applied and we were able to have a

00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:05,860
higher conversion rate for site

00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:07,780
registrants and a much vastly improved

00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:09,640
experience for not only our site

00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:11,470
visitors but all of the authors in the

00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:15,720
51 regions who need to tell the story

00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:15,720
about impact in their particular region

00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:23,560
so this was our first project using

00:25:19,570 --> 00:25:26,080
pattern lab as an agency and it was

00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:29,740
really awesome we really enjoyed using

00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:31,990
it it was great to help ensure brand

00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:35,260
consistency across these different

00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:37,240
platforms and sites because of how

00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:38,740
integrated pattern lab is with Drupal

00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:41,020
you make a change as someone saying you

00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:44,050
make a you say you change a button color

00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:46,890
it profit it just kind of changes all of

00:25:44,050 --> 00:25:49,540
the other locations where that button is

00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:51,340
it's easier for front-end developers to

00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:53,310
kind of prototype and iterate and be

00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:55,960
experimental without having to rely on

00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:59,110
something being pre-built by the back

00:25:55,960 --> 00:26:01,030
end developers or having to spend a lot

00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:03,100
of time with with the visual designers

00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:04,669
they could experiment a bit more on

00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:07,190
their own and be a bit more

00:26:04,669 --> 00:26:09,590
autonomous in that way and it just makes

00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:13,090
it easier to maintain a single source of

00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:15,619
truth than say a design UI library

00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:18,649
separate from you know to separate from

00:26:15,619 --> 00:26:25,129
the front end code so overall easier to

00:26:18,649 --> 00:26:28,070
have that central source okay and a few

00:26:25,129 --> 00:26:29,749
of our learnings for moving from d78

00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:33,830
I'm sure there are more than on this

00:26:29,749 --> 00:26:36,769
list but number one not all modules were

00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:39,139
available in d8 so those required us to

00:26:36,769 --> 00:26:41,509
maybe write some custom code do some

00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:45,769
workarounds a lot of the documentation

00:26:41,509 --> 00:26:48,820
is relatively light especially for our

00:26:45,769 --> 00:26:51,350
setup we were not running decoupled and

00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:53,539
I think that's getting more mature as

00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:55,899
time progresses so that seems like it'll

00:26:53,539 --> 00:27:01,489
be less of a problem in the near future

00:26:55,899 --> 00:27:04,850
and I think speaking for our developers

00:27:01,489 --> 00:27:07,129
there was a steep learning curve in

00:27:04,850 --> 00:27:09,499
terms of getting comfortable with our

00:27:07,129 --> 00:27:12,100
new stack so not only going from D

00:27:09,499 --> 00:27:15,289
seventy-eights but also learning twig

00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:17,480
pattern lab all at the same time I felt

00:27:15,289 --> 00:27:24,220
like kind of a big big shift all at once

00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:24,220
so definitely not for the faint of heart

00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:31,999
but it is very possible and we think

00:27:29,570 --> 00:27:32,419
that if you have the opportunity to do

00:27:31,999 --> 00:27:34,009
that

00:27:32,419 --> 00:27:37,220
this kind of work you should definitely

00:27:34,009 --> 00:27:39,529
do it there's a little bit of a learning

00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:42,559
curve as there is with any kind of new

00:27:39,529 --> 00:27:45,159
space or new platform in particular in

00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:48,259
terms of aligning on terminology for

00:27:45,159 --> 00:27:51,109
across designers and developers and

00:27:48,259 --> 00:27:53,389
product managers because we all had to

00:27:51,109 --> 00:27:56,779
kind of learn to define some of the

00:27:53,389 --> 00:27:59,659
middle categories like like molecules

00:27:56,779 --> 00:28:01,039
and organisms in the same way which was

00:27:59,659 --> 00:28:03,289
a little bit harder than say the

00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:04,789
templates are the atoms so you just need

00:28:03,289 --> 00:28:06,739
a you know plan to have a little bit of

00:28:04,789 --> 00:28:08,600
ramped up time to align on that if

00:28:06,739 --> 00:28:14,659
you're trying to get your team started

00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:16,549
on pattern lab and one of our I guess

00:28:14,659 --> 00:28:18,119
most salient points is we think that

00:28:16,549 --> 00:28:21,029
investing the time now

00:28:18,119 --> 00:28:22,739
will result in time save later so we

00:28:21,029 --> 00:28:25,799
invested a lot in professional

00:28:22,739 --> 00:28:27,149
development in new technology but this

00:28:25,799 --> 00:28:30,329
is going to really help Teach for

00:28:27,149 --> 00:28:35,639
America long term and it's definitely

00:28:30,329 --> 00:28:37,319
worth it and don't be afraid mmm and I

00:28:35,639 --> 00:28:40,829
think that's sort of what we will leave

00:28:37,319 --> 00:28:43,469

00:28:40,829 --> 00:28:45,209
