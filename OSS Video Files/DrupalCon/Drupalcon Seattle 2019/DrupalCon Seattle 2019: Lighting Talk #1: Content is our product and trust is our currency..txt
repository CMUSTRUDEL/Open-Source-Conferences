Title: DrupalCon Seattle 2019: Lighting Talk #1: Content is our product and trust is our currency.
Publication date: 2019-04-11
Playlist: Drupalcon Seattle 2019
Description: 
	Trust is one of the the bedrocks for sustaining relationships. Your customers need to trust your company or organization in order to trust your products. If your organization’s primary product offering is information, how do you instill trust in a customer-centric content delivery approach?

Gaining trust from your customers is not an easy job, especially if you are a large organization or a government entity.

Large companies, non-profits, and government organizations can benefit from a content-driven ecosystem that fortifies a trusting relationship with your audience.

This talk addresses how visual branding, effective content strategy, and leveraging a content management system enable your organization to gain your customers’ trust and interact with your audience with confidence.

	00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,819
good afternoon everyone can everyone

00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:07,980
hear me looks at the back great awesome

00:00:04,819 --> 00:00:14,040
how's everyone doing whoo

00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:20,250
all right I like that let's start with a

00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:21,779
story so a few weeks ago my admin tells

00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:25,199
me there is somebody who is like wanting

00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:26,730
to talk to you about a story they want

00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,429
to publish about some of the projects

00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:32,070
that we are working on in many cases I'm

00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:34,020
more than happy to share our stories so

00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:36,719
that someone else who is looking for a

00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:39,329
similar path to pursue can you know find

00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:41,010
their way or they can reach out to us

00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:43,020
however whenever I was looking for

00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:46,289
answers you know I was looking for

00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:47,879
similar stories so I called not these

00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:51,030
guys this is not the magazine but it is

00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:52,530
something similar and they were very

00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:55,399
complementing of some of the work that

00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:58,469
you know me and my team had done and

00:00:55,399 --> 00:00:59,730
wanted to write about it and took me

00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:01,850
through almost an hour-long interview

00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:05,990
asking questions and towards the end

00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:08,750
said that if you could find us sponsors

00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:13,790
that would be able to contribute up to

00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:13,790
$5,000 we are good to go on this story

00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:23,490
right so that really hit it close to

00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:27,020
what I always really kind of pursued as

00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:33,210
a topic of my personal interest which is

00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:36,390
content and how that gives other people

00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:39,210
information through trust and building

00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:42,780
trust and it is so critical for everyone

00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:44,549
to have that on the back of my mind that

00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:47,189
you know in every interaction that they

00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:49,740
pursue now this was a personal over the

00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:52,290
phone but personal interaction a lot of

00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:54,420
people get you know deceived in so many

00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:57,000
ways that we know we know of these scams

00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:58,829
and then all of these fall from like a

00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,439
range of something that is absolutely

00:01:58,829 --> 00:02:03,750
say criminal do something like what

00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:06,509
happened to me which is not criminal but

00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:08,910
clearly I'm not gonna buy that magazine

00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:10,890
even or trust that magazine going

00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:13,390
forward so what they ended up not only

00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:16,120
stealing from me is my hour but

00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:19,569
also my trust and you know which I would

00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:21,400
have or could have just basically given

00:02:19,569 --> 00:02:24,640
them you know the benefit of doubt and

00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:29,220
bought their magazine so when we talk

00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:31,390
about content and how it builds trust a

00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:33,070
little introduction my name is Nikhil

00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:36,459
Deshpande I'm the chief digital officer

00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:38,620
with the state of Georgia and I run the

00:02:36,459 --> 00:02:41,440
office of digital services I I have this

00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:45,010
amazing team of content contributors of

00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:49,360
developers of UX engineers and our

00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:52,150
entire purpose is to make sure that we

00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:55,810
make government understandable for

00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:57,519
regular citizens so clearly you know all

00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:58,959
of us can attest like at some point of

00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:02,260
the other we have had interactions with

00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:05,260
government and regardless of what they

00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:07,209
intend is we have had like certain

00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:09,730
friction points because just the nature

00:03:07,209 --> 00:03:11,769
of that interaction is always in the

00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:13,720
form of either we have paying something

00:03:11,769 --> 00:03:17,320
or you know someone has pulled us over

00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:20,829
so it is never a delightful interaction

00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:22,780
so we don't ask buyer to try and be

00:03:20,829 --> 00:03:25,239
delightful at all but try and take the

00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:28,329
friction away as much as possible but

00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:31,390
while we do that we always try and make

00:03:28,329 --> 00:03:33,760
sure that the intent that government

00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:37,840
tries to offer these services for the

00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:40,420
benefit of citizens is conveyed and the

00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,829
friction that takes in place because no

00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:44,170
one thought about what that experience

00:03:41,829 --> 00:03:50,380
is gonna be is removed from that

00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:53,380
interaction so here's our problem we

00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:57,519
have about we have a Drupal platform

00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:59,500
that hosts about 110 websites and that

00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:02,320
represents pretty much most of the state

00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:04,989
government departments and elected

00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:09,430
officials they manage their own content

00:04:04,989 --> 00:04:11,650
and we don't have educated content or

00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:14,049
answer educated trained content people

00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:15,519
they're all educated but as far as web

00:04:14,049 --> 00:04:18,130
content management is concerned they are

00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:21,789
not quite trained so although their

00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:23,590
intentions are right a lot of times the

00:04:21,789 --> 00:04:26,190
way they use this platform might not be

00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:27,670
the best way to use it so that is our

00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:29,500
problem that is

00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:32,050
or challenge to begin with but that's

00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:34,690
not the only one the other one is

00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:37,150
something that you know always reminds

00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:40,780
us where Pew Research Center towards the

00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:43,450
end of 2017 did this detailed research

00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:44,740
about public trust and what are some of

00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:47,740
the factors now this is a loaded

00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:49,690
research but they basically said public

00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:52,090
trust in government is near historic

00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:53,710
lows right and this like I said it's a

00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:56,110
loaded research you need not just have

00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:57,970
like one or two factors to it they were

00:04:56,110 --> 00:05:00,660
actually quite a many factors that

00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:05,350
actually came to this conclusion and

00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:07,150
this is a challenge right and while we

00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:09,760
can't just solve this with one or two

00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:11,620
changes or even ten changes there are so

00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:14,560
many thousands of tiny changes that we

00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:19,030
can actually influence that may help

00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:21,370
move the needle a little bit so this is

00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:23,350
something like they showed where you

00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:24,670
know at one point see how high it was

00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:27,060
and they have the names of the

00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:30,460
presidents again this is not a political

00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:34,150
statement but just to have definitions

00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:36,040
over the years of the chronology that's

00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:38,680
how they signified what their findings

00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:40,840
were so this research is actually a

00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:42,190
challenge for all the government sectors

00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:44,440
not only federal government but also

00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:46,420
state local everyone because when we

00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:48,940
interact with anyone for us its

00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:50,830
government we don't we barely you know

00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:55,890
distinguish between state or county

00:05:50,830 --> 00:06:00,460
right so some of the things that we

00:05:55,890 --> 00:06:02,560
embed within our working philosophy on a

00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:07,180
day to day basis is what I'm gonna share

00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:09,910
here if you find this helpful and

00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:12,760
interesting please tweet it out I have a

00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:14,770
team back at in Atlanta who would love

00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:16,720
to see some feedback for some of the

00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:20,290
content that we work on a day to day

00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:22,330
basis so the first one would be meet the

00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:25,030
people where they are now this is not

00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:26,440
something you may have you know never

00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:29,500
seen before but maybe in a different

00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:32,740
form say this is a citizen and they

00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:36,960
interact with government in various

00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:40,300
forms in our content or marketing or UX

00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:41,380
worlds we call these channels so right

00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:43,300
from the

00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:46,510
extreme left which is the physical

00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:50,140
interaction to a male-driven to maybe a

00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:54,400
phone interaction to internet then maybe

00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:56,590
mobile apps social media and now going

00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:59,550
forward we are coming up with this new

00:06:56,590 --> 00:07:01,780
technology which is chat BOTS or

00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:04,420
conversational interfaces we just don't

00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:06,040
know at this point like how much do you

00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:07,410
know even kind of categorize it it keeps

00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:11,830
changing

00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:16,510
while these avenues are all omnipresent

00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:18,610
right I guess the key here is that the

00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:20,850
experience is becoming the critical

00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:23,620
aspect of what defines every interaction

00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:26,110
we are here at DrupalCon but no one can

00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:28,360
deny other than Drupal the other

00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:30,520
underlying theme for all these tracks is

00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:33,220
experience everything that we are trying

00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:35,350
to do is working towards making the

00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:37,690
experience better for either of our

00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:39,640
constituents for over developers or even

00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:42,220
for our stakeholders so that experience

00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:44,680
layer is what is critical for us to

00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:47,350
really kind of gear towards building

00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:51,070
that trust by making sure we make the

00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:53,800
right content decisions so if you just

00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:56,110
kind of map this across a level of you

00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:59,400
know effort on the y-axis and impact on

00:07:56,110 --> 00:08:02,010
the x-axis where we see that in-person

00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:05,920
interactions are probably the most in

00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:09,040
effort intensity for our citizens for

00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:12,220
our users after that probably snail mail

00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:14,560
or you know the internet mobile chat

00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:16,750
BOTS and now actually there are

00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,610
predictive technologies that know

00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:21,490
exactly what you would need maybe a week

00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:23,470
from today and that's how they start

00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:27,130
working towards serving you that content

00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:30,970
going forward I can safely say most of

00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:33,219
the government is right here we still

00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:35,320
not venture that much into on a regular

00:08:33,219 --> 00:08:38,440
day to day basis chat bots maybe some

00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:39,729
cities have but you know at several

00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:42,160
other levels of the government we have

00:08:39,729 --> 00:08:44,160
not and definitely not productive right

00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:47,500
because sometimes predictive is tricky

00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:50,920
anybody heard about that use case by

00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:52,510
target that they reached out saying we

00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:54,190
you may need these pregnancy blah blah

00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:55,210
things the person didn't even know she

00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:57,700
was pregnant

00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:59,230
but this somehow figured out that she

00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:05,620
would be based on some of the shopping

00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:10,360
I'm sorry father found out thank you

00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:12,130
even worse I mean they were they were

00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:14,890
probably on top of their game as far as

00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:17,380
predicting that's concerned but Oh

00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:20,649
totally wrong place to go and break that

00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:22,060
news but yeah this is wherever

00:09:20,649 --> 00:09:24,339
constituents are this is wherever

00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:26,440
citizens are all right so clearly there

00:09:24,339 --> 00:09:28,270
is a gap and while I say government is

00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:30,370
here there is a good chance a lot of the

00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:34,300
other companies are here private sector

00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:37,000
companies are here that we deal with so

00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:41,709
the best thing to do is just measure

00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:43,540
your experience so you get a good lay of

00:09:41,709 --> 00:09:46,959
the land of like what are you dealing

00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:49,390
with this is something you may work with

00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:51,940
your UX teams or but maybe you are part

00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:53,890
of a UX team this is a really good way

00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:56,500
to map the experience it is called the

00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:57,610
customer journey and you must have heard

00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:59,920
about this because there is a good

00:09:57,610 --> 00:10:01,600
chance if your UX team has worked on a

00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:04,690
customer journey and you work with them

00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:08,200
from a Content perspective you should

00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:09,760
have a copy of your journeys this is a

00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:12,790
good indicator of where your customer

00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:14,290
starts from and where they end that's

00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:16,180
when you know what the touch points are

00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:18,130
and that's when you know where you know

00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:19,900
the friction points are and then you can

00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:21,610
start working on that particular

00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:23,680
instance because remember I said it's

00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:28,270
all these little things it's not one Big

00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:30,910
Bang let me tell you something about us

00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:33,580
right how we changed and try to make

00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:38,130
tiny bit of a difference this is George

00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:41,890
or gov way way way back when agents are

00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:44,050
government websites look like this it

00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:48,250
was just a face of a website that

00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:49,540
connected users to government it was

00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:51,880
considered to one stop

00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:53,940
we know one door to come in and then the

00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:55,930
web start figures out where to send that

00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:57,430
essentially what the website did was

00:10:55,930 --> 00:11:00,130
when the user came to Georgia rod gov

00:10:57,430 --> 00:11:03,490
the website was hyperlinked to other

00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:05,140
websites hundreds of them and then the

00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:06,850
user would find it was like a Yahoo

00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:08,570
model find what they're looking for

00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:10,220
click on that link

00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:12,140
so for example if someone wants to if

00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:14,510
you guys move to Georgia and you want to

00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:17,960
start your own business you would go to

00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:21,500
Georgia log of you then George would go

00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:23,090
sends you to the first site that is part

00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:24,980
of that process of starting your

00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:26,300
business that site sends you to another

00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:28,790
site that's like saying they're doing

00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:32,030
another site so it took three websites

00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:37,580
for someone to actually create register

00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:40,310
their business we redesigned Georgia log

00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:42,380
of about eight years ago and when we did

00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:44,330
that one of the things that we made sure

00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:46,130
was we wanted to redesign these

00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:48,170
experiences and this is where

00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:50,210
understanding that journey was critical

00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:53,750
because what we did was when we

00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:56,390
redesigned it took this experience and

00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:58,700
instead of sending them to all of these

00:11:56,390 --> 00:12:01,910
three web sites hoping that they would

00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:04,100
go in that particular order we got

00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:06,950
content out of those three web sites and

00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:12,430
put it in one very easily consumable

00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:15,530
form on Georgia log of itself so when we

00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:17,750
launched this new site we had this list

00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:22,820
of popular topics which basically showed

00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:24,920
every topic that is the most popular for

00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:27,860
a user that they come to see some of the

00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:32,480
other either any information or try to

00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:35,630
create a transaction it looks something

00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:37,940
like this it was curated it was created

00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:40,820
and it was really simple

00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:44,230
we used plain language it was

00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:47,540
understandable and our traffic went up

00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:51,260
people started coming here to use it as

00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:54,200
much as possible the next is you know

00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:56,720
not only just try and scrub this but

00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:59,360
also connect the dots there are so many

00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:02,090
dots behind the scenes that we could

00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:05,060
connect so for example up here this need

00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:07,520
not be a page actually all of us really

00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:09,830
should stop thinking as far as websites

00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:11,990
are concerned in form of pages as units

00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:14,780
because we are all content people this

00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:16,910
is one particular piece of content but

00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:18,530
we can also figure out these different

00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:21,650
dots within this piece of content that

00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:22,550
creates structure within the content so

00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:24,860
we started

00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:27,350
ensure that what you should know and fa

00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:31,310
Q's are each of their structured content

00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:33,080
types and Drupal allows this which is we

00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:35,750
just went great thing about Drupal is it

00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:38,779
started given this page this particular

00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:41,600
piece of content structure what it did

00:13:38,779 --> 00:13:44,870
was behind the scenes it started feeding

00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:46,310
that to search engines now typically for

00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:48,790
a business this would be a nightmare

00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:52,550
because then you would lose pageviews

00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:54,050
but for government this is success we

00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:55,399
don't want people to come on our site

00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:58,519
because that's an extra click for them

00:13:55,399 --> 00:14:00,529
if someone Google's how do I apply for a

00:13:58,519 --> 00:14:02,360
business license in Georgia and if

00:14:00,529 --> 00:14:07,490
Google's tell them right up there in the

00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:11,779
card what they need to know awesome it

00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:14,149
saves them time it builds trust they

00:14:11,779 --> 00:14:19,360
might not even know where this is coming

00:14:14,149 --> 00:14:22,640
from but they are informed not only that

00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:24,769
we created an Alexa skill that started

00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:29,209
drawing the same content from Georgia

00:14:24,769 --> 00:14:31,839
and answering people so we started now

00:14:29,209 --> 00:14:36,410
serving multiple channels based on

00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:39,020
certain content changes it is really

00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:42,110
important that we connect all the

00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:44,899
information that we have and make use of

00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:47,149
it from a trust-building perspective for

00:14:44,899 --> 00:14:50,180
example this is another example where

00:14:47,149 --> 00:14:54,020
the Guardian and you may have also you

00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:57,950
know seen this where if any article on

00:14:54,020 --> 00:15:00,410
the garden is older than maybe one year

00:14:57,950 --> 00:15:04,790
there's a certain threshold it is very

00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:07,339
evidently highlighted up there and not

00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:10,100
only is highlighted on the website even

00:15:07,339 --> 00:15:14,240
on a Twitter feed it is called out that

00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:17,320
this article is from 2015 amazing right

00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:20,269
because that immediately builds trust a

00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:22,430
lot of times we stumble upon things and

00:15:20,269 --> 00:15:26,089
we start in a wondering oh this is

00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:28,490
although this is not helpful so we start

00:15:26,089 --> 00:15:31,279
empowering people that's another great

00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:33,290
way of building that trust we have to

00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:35,660
empower people for example if you

00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:36,440
remember back in the day websites used

00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:38,420
to

00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:40,129
you know you go up on the website and

00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:42,110
they're like can I get your location

00:15:40,129 --> 00:15:44,779
there you are maybe you started

00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:46,699
interacting with the website for any of

00:15:44,779 --> 00:15:49,519
us will be like no why do you want to

00:15:46,699 --> 00:15:51,740
know my location I don't want to tell

00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:54,980
you where I am because that's not the

00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:57,079
right thing to do at that time but will

00:15:54,980 --> 00:16:01,069
freak out if that blue dot moves away

00:15:57,079 --> 00:16:03,980
from where we are standing so we choose

00:16:01,069 --> 00:16:06,339
on our end to either share something or

00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:09,139
not share something that is empowerment

00:16:06,339 --> 00:16:12,800
towards our users and that's something

00:16:09,139 --> 00:16:15,740
we have to be very careful about before

00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:18,290
I end I just want to say that just be

00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:20,779
genuine this is not something that only

00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:22,610
governments follow any of these brands

00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:25,730
today we live in such a trust-based

00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:30,399
Marketing System that unless something

00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:33,769
you know builds or does something to

00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:35,389
break that trust we want to believe in a

00:16:33,769 --> 00:16:38,720
certain brand and we want to make sure

00:16:35,389 --> 00:16:41,000
that they do good so have content that

00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,970
is something that is helpful be genuine

00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,199
be transparent in any of the

00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:48,199
interactions in any of the intentions

00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:50,899
and or obstruct right the obstruction of

00:16:48,199 --> 00:16:53,120
advertising like it used to be is like

00:16:50,899 --> 00:16:54,529
really the for the bygone era like today

00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,720
we want to build together we want to

00:16:54,529 --> 00:16:58,370
work together we want to collaborate

00:16:55,720 --> 00:17:01,699
into you know doing something that is

00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:04,490
more symbiotic for the brand and for us

00:17:01,699 --> 00:17:06,199
as consumers so I just want to end by

00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:08,089
you know kind of quoting a startled

00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:08,959
where like the whole is greater than the

00:17:08,089 --> 00:17:11,449
sum of its parts

00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:15,169
building trust is essentially like a

00:17:11,449 --> 00:17:17,390
larger outcome but it starts with very

00:17:15,169 --> 00:17:20,059
small interaction pieces these small

00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:23,089
decision pieces and only then we are

00:17:20,059 --> 00:17:24,679
able to do that thank you I appreciate

00:17:23,089 --> 00:17:25,850
the time you gave me if you have any

00:17:24,679 --> 00:17:27,709
questions I will be around

00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:30,679
that's my Twitter handle feel free to

00:17:27,709 --> 00:17:34,250
reach out also and you know I'll be

00:17:30,679 --> 00:17:37,080
happy to help you or learn from you at

any given time thanks again
