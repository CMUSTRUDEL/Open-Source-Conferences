Title: DrupalCon Seattle 2019: Which Accessibility Tools are Right for You?
Publication date: 2019-04-12
Playlist: Drupalcon Seattle 2019
Description: 
	If you are in an organization who needs to step up their accessibility compliance, accessibility testing and remediation is a big deal.

Accessibility testing has a lot of moving parts! There are so many tools. So many! Plugins, suites, crawlers, dashboards, CI tests, and more.



Which tools are right for you?
Will only one tool fit all of your needs? ;)
Build vs. buy some vs. buy vs. free? Is "free" really free?


This is not a session about "what tools did our team use". This is a broader overview of the a11y testing tool types, challenges and benefits of the different types, rough costs (when applicable), and the best use cases for them.

Challenges this session adresses:

When searching for tools, you can find lists of tools, but not comprehensive comparisons of tools to make the decision of which one(s) to use and buy for your need. 

We compared a vast amount of tools to analyze and choose the best for our need as a digital agency specializing in accessible design and development and for our clients' needs as public entities requiring multiple levels of compliance.

A developer's tool needs (and budget) may be much different than a larger organizations need for multi-site dashboards and reporting experiences.

All levels of experience can get value out of this session.

Target audiences:

Tool procurement teams 
Developers 
Website "Owners" / Stakeholders responsible for compliance
Project Managers  
Dev Team Managers
