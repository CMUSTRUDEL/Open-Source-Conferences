Title: DrupalCon Seattle 2019: Drupal Europe 2018 - our learnings from organising a large camp
Publication date: 2019-04-12
Playlist: Drupalcon Seattle 2019
Description: 
	In September 2017 a group of Drupal community members decided to fill the gap of no DrupalCon in Europe in 2018 and organise Drupal Europe. 

Weekly meetings were organised for status meetings and working groups created to work on tasks related to the event. The first priority was to find a venue and location to organise the event.
 
The key location requirements where that it could facilitate quality as well as be affordable. This was the big challenge, we knew not to search in metropolitan or capital areas. 

The call for venues delivered us with 13 options of whom one was not in Europe but Australia. 

After careful consideration and validating all the pros and cons, one proposal stood out. While most of the venues proposed could have worked, we choose Darmstadt because it provided a good combination of an amazing venue in a very accessible location combined with reasonable pricing. It was key that the German community not only suggested us the venue but they were ready to stand behind the event and serve as the fiscal entity. 

The event took place in September 2018 and in this session we want to talk about how our work was organised, what we changed from the original DrupalCon format, what worked out and what didn't, what challenges we faced during the organisation and what are learnings are.

More detailed information can be found in the Drupal Europe post report that was published on the 19. October 2018 and can be found here: https://www.drupal.org/project/drupaleurope/issues/3007861

The session will be held by two of the main organisers of Drupal Europe.

okay yeah just like yeah okay let's just

00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:12,389
start right so welcome to that talk

00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:13,950
about Drupal Europe that we did in 2018

00:00:12,389 --> 00:00:15,570
and we're just gonna share with you the

00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:20,490
learnings that we had and actually

00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:22,470
hoping that we can maybe do fewer

00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:24,750
mistakes and more of the stuff that we

00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:28,949
actually think that we managed to do

00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:32,669
good so I'm Patti and I was in the team

00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:37,860
and - with me yeah and I'm I'm Gabbar I

00:00:32,669 --> 00:00:39,629
was also on the team yeah there are

00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:44,129
several others that will show towards

00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:45,870
the end of the slides so Preston was

00:00:44,129 --> 00:00:50,010
this the first like why did we do Drupal

00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:52,170
Europe so there was a neat because there

00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:55,829
was no Drupal con in 2018 we felt

00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:58,050
actually very abandoned by the Drupal

00:00:55,829 --> 00:01:00,239
Association and that was a fact so there

00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:03,600
was a lot of anger in the European

00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:05,400
community and we had a lot of sessions

00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,290
and this was one of the first ones then

00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,630
we were sitting in trouble camp Belgium

00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,270
and we decide like why are we actually

00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:14,460
why do we care you know why is it for us

00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:17,369
a big topic to do a camp

00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:20,189
con like that or a conference and I

00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:21,630
think that the reason why the Drupal

00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:25,110
Association stopped doing it because we

00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:27,540
had a loss but and that was is not a

00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:29,670
sustainable model for them so we of

00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:32,520
course thought that we could do that

00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:33,810
differently and we were actually mostly

00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:36,060
and I think that gap or said that

00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:38,369
correctly is that we need to have this

00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:40,829
event so we can actually get people to

00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:42,329
contribute to the project so if we don't

00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:44,909
do these events we don't get

00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:46,680
contributors to contribute and then we

00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:51,420
have difficulties and especially in

00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:54,630
Europe as we are very proud of this next

00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:58,229
slide which is 45% of drupal

00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:59,610
contributors are from europe a lot of

00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:01,530
them of course also sponsored by

00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:03,030
companies that are not in europe but

00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:06,570
still it is an important fact so

00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:08,849
therefore important that we have

00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:11,520
something like that where we can also

00:02:08,849 --> 00:02:13,800
meet because not everybody can come to

00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,620
the United States to a conference

00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:19,060
yeah so many of the Europeans were

00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:22,930
concerned because they've seen that ok

00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:25,450
the DEA makes money in the US but but if

00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:28,270
you look at where Drupal is made it's in

00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:30,760
a large part made in Europe so we were

00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:32,320
like conflicted about the feeling that

00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:35,140
the conference is not going to be held

00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:39,250
but all even though a big part of Drupal

00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:42,520
is made in Europe so what happened

00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:43,600
actually next is that we started to you

00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:46,750
know we had like they were actually

00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:48,940
multiple groups that were forming and in

00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:50,980
Drupal con Vienna there was a little bit

00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:52,870
tough also because there were more

00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:54,790
groups that wanted to do this together

00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:55,870
so that was also like we had to bring

00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:57,910
these groups together

00:02:55,870 --> 00:03:00,220
and make sure that everybody was in the

00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:03,010
same path so that probably started there

00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:04,510
in Drupal con Vienna we joined this one

00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:10,750
and we put out the first hello world

00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:13,600
post and and then there actually what

00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:16,870
happened the Nexus that we got like the

00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:18,940
hello world post yes that was there were

00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:21,970
three things that we said that would be

00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:24,100
important one is that we want to bring

00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:27,760
together the community that was like

00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:30,400
coal number one number two we want to

00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:34,360
make sure that Drupal stays as a really

00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:37,330
strong brand in Europe and and the third

00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:40,980
was that we actually want to show that

00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:44,380
we can do an event in Europe that is

00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:46,690
sustainable and that the cost will not

00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:49,989
we will not be losing so these were the

00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:51,640
three things that we were aiming at from

00:03:49,989 --> 00:03:55,239
the start so this is probably what we

00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:56,860
sat down in the first week that we

00:03:55,239 --> 00:03:58,870
defined and put it out in a hello world

00:03:56,860 --> 00:04:01,360
post and Vienna we had a lot of

00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:03,370
discussions of do we even need this

00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,600
event in terms of Europe because there

00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:05,890
is already tough days and there's

00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:08,110
already fronting United and there's a

00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:10,120
bunch of other events that attract a lot

00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:12,040
of people and we came back to this

00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:13,900
realization that we need a place for the

00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:16,630
community to get together all together

00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:19,540
and to cross influence each other from

00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:21,700
businesses to developers to marketers to

00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:24,250
content editors to whoever's using

00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:25,840
Drupal and and have this crass influence

00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:27,490
whereas like somebody comes in who

00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:31,750
using your software and you can be proud

00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:34,120
of providing of building that software

00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:35,440
that they could make value with and they

00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:39,270
could provide you feedback how to

00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:42,040
improve what you were working on yeah so

00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:46,930
this was done in October which was then

00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:48,520
we had a year but the first thing you

00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:50,080
need to do is of course to see like

00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:53,139
where can we actually have this event

00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:55,330
and that is a really tricky part when

00:04:53,139 --> 00:04:57,310
there is only one year before the event

00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:59,380
because we knew that we had to find

00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:01,870
something that had more than a space for

00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:05,470
at least 1,000 people so we were always

00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:08,380
looking at up to two thousand so finding

00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:11,620
any event new for such a large event

00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:15,310
there's nothing that is easy so we first

00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:18,160
did like a call for venues and we got a

00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:20,560
lot of submissions some of them were

00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:23,350
more serious than others and others were

00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,850
actually just putting in a name so some

00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:26,680
of them followed with like an

00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:30,039
information so this this model was

00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:31,180
taking from the DEF tests right yep so

00:05:30,039 --> 00:05:33,460
there was a there's always a question

00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:35,520
list and F days that goes around because

00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:38,680
theft is in front and United is

00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:41,500
organized in a European level so there

00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:44,410
is this list of things that you should

00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:48,340
fill in and then the community selects

00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:50,680
the good the best case or the one that

00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:53,979
fits the best so we got all of these

00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:57,400
venues of missions and one we even got

00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:59,669
from Australia like the Europeans know

00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:01,870
that Eurovision that song context

00:05:59,669 --> 00:06:02,889
Australia is allowed to participate in

00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:04,270
that so they thought that they would

00:06:02,889 --> 00:06:06,580
also be allowed to participate in

00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:10,740
rubicon Europe yeah why not they were

00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:14,020
not selected so there were obviously uh

00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:18,180
we went really close in to looking at

00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:23,020
event venues in Germany Netherlands and

00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:24,820
also in Scotland and Poland probably

00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:27,610
these were those that we went into the

00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:29,710
big most detail so what we do is yeah we

00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:32,919
did like a interview with them or we

00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:34,990
spoke to them we got more information we

00:06:32,919 --> 00:06:37,750
we looked at the pros and cons and we

00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:39,670
made up a sheet where we could say okay

00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:41,350
how cheap is

00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:44,050
for people to get there how easy is it

00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:45,340
how far is it from the airport and we

00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:47,110
had to think about all these things so

00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:49,990
this is also everything that we can

00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:51,430
share with all of you but other thing

00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:53,440
the criteria there was also pretty

00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:55,330
pretty good how that was set up we came

00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:57,070
from days and we do use an event that

00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:59,410
could scale from maybe a thousand people

00:06:57,070 --> 00:07:01,300
to maybe 2,000 people and like have the

00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:04,350
kinds of flexible room set up and stuff

00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:07,930
like that that could accommodate that so

00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:10,570
we selected thermostats which we thought

00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:13,360
that was amazing because the venue if

00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:15,430
you for those who came you you saw that

00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:19,270
the venue was just great

00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:22,120
every single room had light so you were

00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:24,340
always exposed to sunlight and it was

00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:26,280
just generally probably one of the best

00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:30,460
conference venues that I've ever been to

00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:32,890
pretty new but there was obviously of

00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:40,800
course a reason why this venue was not

00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:45,640
booked in the week that we booked it so

00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:47,470
first what we what we heard is that

00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:50,080
there was a lot that one of the largest

00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:52,180
conferences that happen in Frankfurt and

00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:54,490
firms that is only 20 minutes away from

00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:56,650
Frank words so one of the large C's

00:07:54,490 --> 00:08:00,670
conferences that happen in Europe almost

00:07:56,650 --> 00:08:02,230
takes place in the same week so when we

00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:04,960
started when we had already booked the

00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:06,220
venue we were looking at where we got

00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,110
this information we started to look for

00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:10,920
hotels and we saw that there was just no

00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:13,990
hotel like there was nothing available

00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:17,290
Airbnb or poking calm it was this

00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:18,970
everything was full so that's that is

00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:22,090
definitely something that we will next

00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:24,070
time check like why is the venue

00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:26,380
available in this week or do you want to

00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:31,000
take it what's the catch yeah and it

00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:34,510
also had a conflict too pretty important

00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:38,380
religious holidays so that also we

00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:41,110
didn't think about and the kids that

00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:44,380
came a lot of discussions and and around

00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:47,320
that and of course what we don't try to

00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:49,510
do the best out of it by moving around

00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:52,779
so treasonous with Reese note was for

00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:55,629
example on Wednesday and we a little bit

00:08:52,779 --> 00:08:57,699
the program so we could at least because

00:08:55,629 --> 00:09:01,829
it was the it was the Monday that was

00:08:57,699 --> 00:09:04,269
the that was really conflicting with

00:09:01,829 --> 00:09:10,300
with our holiday so these are two things

00:09:04,269 --> 00:09:12,129
that we had with with that so then came

00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:13,809
the next challenge how do you actually

00:09:12,129 --> 00:09:18,069
organize something with a team of people

00:09:13,809 --> 00:09:20,410
that have never met and we don't know

00:09:18,069 --> 00:09:22,930
each other that well actually we didn't

00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:24,819
even know each other before so there

00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:28,149
were we were really organized and I

00:09:24,819 --> 00:09:33,579
think that we we did a lot of good

00:09:28,149 --> 00:09:36,009
things in organizational aspects we had

00:09:33,579 --> 00:09:37,839
Gigi we decided on tools in the

00:09:36,009 --> 00:09:41,860
beginning so we decided and using GHC

00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:44,529
for online meetings that was okay okay

00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:46,990
at least it was for free so we didn't

00:09:44,529 --> 00:09:51,279
have to pay for the service but it

00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:54,399
worked out okay so we used slack for

00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:58,439
chatting we set up really early on a

00:09:54,399 --> 00:10:02,610
Google Drive we started by using Trello

00:09:58,439 --> 00:10:06,309
then we went to OpenSocial and then we

00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:10,509
set up a project on open project or we

00:10:06,309 --> 00:10:13,059
that was something that we used and we

00:10:10,509 --> 00:10:15,160
cetera but actually we didn't use that

00:10:13,059 --> 00:10:16,569
we didn't use either of them at the end

00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:18,850
so we were like moving from tool to tool

00:10:16,569 --> 00:10:21,189
in case we maybe find the right the gold

00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:23,740
in the solution but it as a matter of

00:10:21,189 --> 00:10:26,769
fact you will not I mean volunteers who

00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:28,360
work on at least in our event the

00:10:26,769 --> 00:10:30,309
volunteers who worked on this event for

00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:32,379
their enjoyment they did not enjoy

00:10:30,309 --> 00:10:35,139
updating project management tools with

00:10:32,379 --> 00:10:39,819
their status it didn't happen so that

00:10:35,139 --> 00:10:44,040
was hard we use gitlab for everything in

00:10:39,819 --> 00:10:48,970
relation to the code of the website and

00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:50,800
then we used pre ticks for we set up a

00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:54,189
pre ticks which is an open-source it's

00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:58,899
an open-source ticketing tool and I

00:10:54,189 --> 00:11:00,779
think it's saved us 30,000 let's just

00:10:58,899 --> 00:11:04,929
say dollars because it's almost the same

00:11:00,779 --> 00:11:07,019
that we would have paid to for fees to

00:11:04,929 --> 00:11:10,899
other services

00:11:07,019 --> 00:11:13,420
yeah so 30,000 was actually it was we

00:11:10,899 --> 00:11:14,920
looked at it in the end and the good

00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:18,189
thing is we had one issue there and

00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:20,649
there was the person who was behind this

00:11:18,189 --> 00:11:22,959
tool is in Germany so that was even

00:11:20,649 --> 00:11:25,990
easier that we could actually just

00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:27,220
basically call him up and get help but

00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:30,759
we of course had to set this up

00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:34,269
ourselves so that also costs time and

00:11:30,759 --> 00:11:36,879
then we used stripe for payments that

00:11:34,269 --> 00:11:38,559
was pretty good yeah and for the

00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:41,980
ticketing tool we also got with it an

00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:44,680
app so when we did the registration we

00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:46,959
actually scanned the code so that came

00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:49,839
all with it so we can really recommend

00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:52,360
that tool it was a pretty the reporting

00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:54,730
to see what has been done and sending

00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:57,790
out coupon codes and creating them was

00:11:54,730 --> 00:12:00,399
really easy so when we had something so

00:11:57,790 --> 00:12:02,170
that was a very good good choice yeah so

00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:05,170
protect saved us a lot of money the UI

00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:07,089
was nice we could like have the the

00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:09,850
ticket ticket selling part embedded on

00:12:07,089 --> 00:12:11,610
the page like any other come so there

00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:14,350
was no there was no limitations other

00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:16,059
that other paid services would not have

00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:17,980
and there was a lot of additional

00:12:16,059 --> 00:12:21,850
benefits like this check-in system and

00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:24,040
it being open source okay so how did we

00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:26,050
organize ourselves in teams so that was

00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:28,509
also something that we had to learn the

00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:30,730
hard way almost because we started of

00:12:28,509 --> 00:12:32,249
course in a one large group and then we

00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:35,860
realized really early we have to start

00:12:32,249 --> 00:12:37,809
dividing the team into sub teams so we

00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:40,480
were really successful with these four

00:12:37,809 --> 00:12:44,069
branches like we call it so it was the

00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:46,809
the web team program team volunteers

00:12:44,069 --> 00:12:49,240
lead team and another organizer team

00:12:46,809 --> 00:12:51,519
that were the main organizers and that

00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:55,959
had to maybe make the certain decisions

00:12:51,519 --> 00:13:00,040
at certain points so we had also like

00:12:55,959 --> 00:13:03,370
single person teams so or we were we did

00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:06,670
that more you know at talk so for

00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:09,699
sponsorships financials catering venue

00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:11,740
attending here communication PR that was

00:13:09,699 --> 00:13:16,629
just more done by one or two people that

00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:20,140
were also part of the other teams then

00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:24,279
we had where we'd meetings so we did

00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:27,310
the weekly update meeting where we know

00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:31,170
just always matters as you know in every

00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:36,459
single team there was a weekly meeting

00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:38,529
at least yeah so and then we put all of

00:13:36,459 --> 00:13:39,910
our meeting notes into Google Drive so

00:13:38,529 --> 00:13:41,140
it was like rolling meeting notes so

00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:42,700
people could always if they couldn't

00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:45,940
attend they could actually go in there

00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:48,130
and then what we also did we used what

00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:51,790
the diversity and inclusion grouped us

00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:53,980
with making an online information so you

00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:56,769
like I'm slack so we made that in

00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:59,320
threats by saying like number one here's

00:13:56,769 --> 00:14:01,810
our status regarding venue so that's how

00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:04,709
we gave people information that didn't

00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:07,570
want to go and look into the weekly

00:14:04,709 --> 00:14:10,660
notes and what was actually important is

00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:12,670
that we allowed and we encouraged always

00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:16,329
people to go to this weekly meeting so

00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:18,070
if anybody wanted to join the team then

00:14:16,329 --> 00:14:21,459
we told them to start going to these

00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:24,130
weekly meetings and then we gave them

00:14:21,459 --> 00:14:26,980
just an hour date but in the web team

00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:30,370
and in those teams they of course went

00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:32,320
in the more detailed yeah so this worked

00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:34,269
much this actually worked for status

00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:37,029
updates unlike all the project

00:14:34,269 --> 00:14:39,399
management software and it also helped

00:14:37,029 --> 00:14:40,959
bond with the team so we could like see

00:14:39,399 --> 00:14:44,199
each other face to face and we like

00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:47,260
created screenshots of the diverse team

00:14:44,199 --> 00:14:50,079
that was organizing the event and and as

00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:53,589
betty said we so just to clarify is that

00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:55,269
for new volunteers who came in we got

00:14:53,589 --> 00:14:57,130
them into the highest-level meeting

00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:59,050
where everybody every team was reporting

00:14:57,130 --> 00:15:00,730
their status so they get to see the

00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:02,079
momentum going like there's a lot of

00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:04,269
stuff happening and everybody's doing

00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:06,430
their things so they could see like all

00:15:04,269 --> 00:15:08,320
the activity and have first of all have

00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:10,540
context of what's going on in general

00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,769
and second of all see that there is all

00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:14,350
this stuff happening and there's

00:15:11,769 --> 00:15:17,800
momentum and they are joining a team

00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:19,660
that has potential yeah and then they

00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:24,519
they they could then find their own

00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:26,350
branch you can call it like that so what

00:15:24,519 --> 00:15:28,270
is actually regarding he notes we just

00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:30,940
want to give you a couple of insights on

00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:32,860
keynotes is that peanuts are hard

00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:36,160
because of the room size

00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:37,810
so we want to have you know you see this

00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:39,550
room here you know we don't have that

00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:42,070
many people in here but we have in other

00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:44,110
rooms we have a lot of people and in the

00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:45,580
keynote room today we had probably four

00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:47,980
thousand people or three thousand people

00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:50,980
so how are you finding a venue that

00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:52,810
actually can't do that so that is hard

00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:55,300
so what what we did is at the keynote

00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:58,450
room there it's actually only half of it

00:15:55,300 --> 00:16:01,540
so we had an opportunity to actually

00:15:58,450 --> 00:16:05,290
make the keynote much larger so we could

00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:07,720
put it up to 1,400 people I think yep

00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:10,120
and in the setup like this we had it

00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:12,100
only half but that had it had to be

00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:13,900
decided like when we also knew how many

00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:15,580
were going to come but we had that

00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:19,000
flexibility in this venue that was what

00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:20,920
we liked about the venue and also like

00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,840
regarding the the other rooms they were

00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:26,020
smaller than the room that we are in now

00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:30,190
so it was about 90 people 100 people

00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:33,730
that could be in there so in the end we

00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:36,730
decided on purpose to keep the keynote

00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:39,220
room even though we had 1010 teens still

00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:41,110
to keep it only for 700 which made like

00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:42,280
us fill up the room because there is

00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:44,980
always a lot of people that are just

00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:46,930
sleeping at home or listening to it

00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:49,150
online so that made a really good

00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:51,850
feeling because you were really a part

00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:54,130
of something big in there and it was

00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:56,950
really close and every single seat was

00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:58,930
filled yeah in terms of keynote content

00:16:56,950 --> 00:17:01,570
we decided to not do an opening keynote

00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:02,950
and not do a closing keynote because we

00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:05,650
could talk about like how much coffee

00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:08,080
was consumed and stuff but there's may

00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:09,820
not be interesting for most people what

00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:11,470
we did in studies we wrote up a report

00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:13,060
that we'll link at the end that where we

00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:14,470
reported on everything that we did and

00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:17,050
like people can go back and read and

00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:19,240
this allowed us to have space for a more

00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:20,980
interesting content and like the more of

00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:23,410
the community to present themselves and

00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:25,870
what they are working on so in the

00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:29,260
search for keynote speakers we went

00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:31,570
really we were really we said that we

00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:32,860
want to talk about the open web and that

00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:35,380
was something that we were passionate

00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:37,000
about so we said that we want to have

00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:38,500
the founder of the WordPress project and

00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,870
the founder of the rupal project to come

00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:43,720
to Drupal Europe and speak about the

00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:45,330
open web and Matt from WordPress he said

00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:48,030
yes to that and we had

00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:50,280
everything was organized and we were

00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:52,440
really excited about having Matt and

00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:56,120
trees on the states because they did

00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:59,970
that last time in 2014 I think but

00:17:56,120 --> 00:18:04,080
unfortunately three weeks before that

00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:06,990
was canceled by that bye bye Matt for

00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:09,300
some other reasons and that was pretty

00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:11,550
hard for us that's a team especially

00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:15,179
because we had been blasting his name on

00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:16,980
all channels what was good is that when

00:18:15,179 --> 00:18:19,380
we started to prune you know promote

00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:21,870
that we didn't see like a pike of people

00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:25,170
buying we didn't say a lot of word press

00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:28,590
people buying tickets to come so so

00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:31,200
therefore it was okay but we got other

00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:34,320
great people but they were a little bit

00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:35,880
more in the last three weeks we were

00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:38,160
basically trying to get people to come

00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:41,010
on that panel and that ended up really

00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:43,650
well yeah yeah I think we got very I

00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:46,020
think we had the best people we we could

00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:48,150
have even even if we would have a longer

00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:52,290
time I think it went really well

00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:54,929
so and then the program we also wanted

00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:58,590
to do something different there and that

00:18:54,929 --> 00:19:00,780
was so we really said that we want to

00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:05,220
have it more an industry vertical and

00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:08,460
use the tax or this tacking so you say

00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:10,770
that I am a government session it fits

00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:12,600
to government and then you can say like

00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:16,320
Pareto like it has attacked like

00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:17,730
migration and accessibility and

00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:21,090
something else which is maybe more the

00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:23,580
traditional tracks here and by this we

00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:25,470
could actually put four people on it

00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:27,030
like crystal who's here in the room he

00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:31,250
was in charge of the government so he

00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:34,440
was really chasing people to submit so

00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:36,600
they asked so in the end like of course

00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:40,470
everything was reviewed like it review

00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:43,620
normally but we had specialists in each

00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:45,570
track team and they then tried to get

00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:49,050
people that would really well fit to it

00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:51,800
so that was a really good success yeah

00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:54,650
this goes back to our focus on the on

00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:56,220
protecting a Drupal brand or or

00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:58,500
strengthening the Trib

00:19:56,220 --> 00:20:00,419
in Europe that we wanted to like focus

00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:02,360
on the industries that are using Drupal

00:20:00,419 --> 00:20:05,159
to show the value that Drupal provides

00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:08,820
and obviously the Drupal and Technology

00:20:05,159 --> 00:20:11,340
got the most submissions so but I think

00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:13,950
that still what what what happened then

00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:15,929
we had for every page a landing page so

00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:17,669
I know that crystal for example he sent

00:20:15,929 --> 00:20:20,190
out to a lot of government people in

00:20:17,669 --> 00:20:22,440
Germany hey this is the the program for

00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:23,730
government and Drupal Europe so for them

00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:26,070
they thought that hey wow there's

00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:29,100
something for us here even though that

00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:34,320
the sessions were related to something

00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:36,270
that was for a builder and this is also

00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:40,320
something that is very normal to see

00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:42,059
that when the submissions get yeah we've

00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,890
had two deadlines so you can see the two

00:20:42,059 --> 00:20:45,210
deadlines probably easily on the screen

00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:47,520
when was the first deadline in the

00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:51,270
second deadline yeah how many did we get

00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:55,890
six hundred and fifty systems in total

00:20:51,270 --> 00:21:01,470
so this was a we had run we were running

00:20:55,890 --> 00:21:06,450
eight parallel sessions per for its time

00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:10,620
I think so we had 170 speakers and 950

00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:15,630
attendees and in total 233 sessions and

00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:17,789
buffs so this slide is very empty

00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:20,400
because we tried to do trainings and it

00:21:17,789 --> 00:21:23,640
didn't work and and why is that is that

00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:26,309
we actually didn't have capacity to

00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:28,440
organize it and we did it way too late

00:21:26,309 --> 00:21:30,539
and when we then started to organize it

00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:32,370
it was also a lot of extra work for us

00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:35,610
so if you ever want to have a training

00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:37,890
at your camp then you also have to keep

00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:40,020
in mind that it puts extra work on you

00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:41,700
as an organizer so if you want to do

00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:44,280
that you want to put a person dedicated

00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:48,210
onto that because you need to promote

00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:49,500
the training you need to make contracts

00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:51,299
with the people who are doing the

00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:54,809
training you need to do some kind of a

00:21:51,299 --> 00:21:57,690
split on the on the cost or the how much

00:21:54,809 --> 00:21:59,010
revenue they are gonna get attending

00:21:57,690 --> 00:22:00,419
their training need to understand that

00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:02,250
they would arrive earlier they would

00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:03,870
book their flights according to that etc

00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:04,560
yeah we did this half-hearted so it

00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:06,870
didn't really work

00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:08,790
no we don't know if we would have put in

00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:12,570
more effort if it would work better or

00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:15,270
not yeah we don't know so ticket sale

00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:18,120
also go briefly through that we did all

00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:20,130
kinds of tickets and maybe the the one

00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:21,720
that we are most proud of I think of

00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:24,300
this list was of course the diversity

00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:28,920
tickets so we teamed up with diversity

00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:33,810
tickets that ticket stork and we donated

00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:36,240
into that pool X amount like I think 25

00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:39,450
tickets and then we promoted that and

00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:41,370
people then were could apply for a

00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:43,740
diversity ticket and they took care of

00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:46,680
approving the after not so we were not

00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:50,100
part of that process and then in the end

00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:53,010
we donated them little amount to for

00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:54,960
their effort of doing it so that was and

00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:57,360
then your event also gets listed on the

00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:59,760
diversity ticket stork cancer gives you

00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:01,320
more exposure and there's no questions

00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:03,540
if you are partial to the people

00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:06,960
submitting or not yeah and we kept the

00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:09,360
prices of the event in similar how it

00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:11,940
was in in triple con before because we

00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:14,250
also had to start somewhere and we just

00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:18,030
did it decided to do it the same way so

00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:19,950
here's also the ticket sale we we talked

00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:21,870
about this also in the report but there

00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:24,480
we saw also peaks in the ticket sale

00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:28,800
depending on when we were promoting the

00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:31,230
camp or promoting the event at various

00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:34,050
camps so we were giving out discount

00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:36,000
codes may be an even in Nashville last

00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:38,100
year there was a discount code for those

00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,170
who were in the comment so we we

00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:42,420
analyzed a little bit how that went but

00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:44,160
it was pretty you know it's almost

00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:47,220
difficult because you need more tickets

00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:50,190
to be sold so that was a hard time to

00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:54,630
watch and count and all that so

00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:57,810
financials okay this is a little bit

00:23:54,630 --> 00:24:00,810
complicated slide because it basically

00:23:57,810 --> 00:24:02,550
shows the line that is all the way in

00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:05,400
the bottom this line that comes is the

00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:07,220
down payments for the venue so this is

00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:11,340
the one the target that we were always

00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:13,610
focusing on because we had to have money

00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:17,100
because we did not have any money

00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:18,240
but we were lucky that the the Drupal

00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:21,690
Association Germany

00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:25,050
they stood behind it so that what they

00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:27,510
were a legal entity behind it so we see

00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:29,370
that the ticketing sale there we knew

00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:30,900
that the total cost was always going to

00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:34,620
be there on top

00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:37,200
sponsorship sale came in there and and

00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:39,720
that was like a little like you see it

00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:44,070
worked out so we never had any problems

00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:46,560
in the payments and we in the end we

00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:49,910
don't know exactly how much profit we

00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:52,740
got but we got profit which is the most

00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:54,960
which came also together just in the end

00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:57,450
we're probably gonna know soon as soon

00:24:54,960 --> 00:25:00,030
as the tax stuff goes through in Germany

00:24:57,450 --> 00:25:04,830
for last year yeah yeah and we also want

00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:07,650
to put a no like show that we also paid

00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:09,600
as they were they were like people part

00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:12,510
of the group that that we're also like

00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:15,120
doing this full-time and we you know

00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:18,120
because we know that it cannot just be

00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:20,790
volunteering work and doing it in your

00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:23,910
free time in the evenings so we were

00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:26,220
either sponsored by the entity or we

00:25:23,910 --> 00:25:28,800
were sponsored by our companies so that

00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:32,610
was very important part of the success I

00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:35,880
think of the camp it's all in the

00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:38,310
reports that we will share with you so

00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:39,870
maybe a little bit to those we were just

00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:42,900
going really briefly through the report

00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:46,260
that you all have access to but these

00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:47,070
are the people who were part of the lead

00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:50,520
volunteerism

00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:53,370
yeah the lead volunteers and just our

00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:54,780
country it was just nice to see from how

00:25:53,370 --> 00:25:59,580
many different countries we were coming

00:25:54,780 --> 00:26:01,620
from and then this is most like the

00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:04,770
picture of like I think that group that

00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:07,500
was volunteering in the end there was a

00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:09,030
lot of a lot of people involved yeah all

00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:14,730
of the registration desk and everything

00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:17,580
was was was done by volunteers and and

00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:19,050
we also regarding catering I don't have

00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:21,090
a slide about that but we have text

00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:25,320
about that we decided to go for a

00:26:21,090 --> 00:26:28,560
vegetarian vegan catering we didn't talk

00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:30,450
about that much because you know people

00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:32,060
are used to eating pasta and salad all

00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:34,160
the time

00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:35,720
why do you have to put emphasis on that

00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:40,520
we even got questions like where's the

00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:42,170
vegetarian food so but there was a lot

00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:45,350
of people that were talking about it

00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:47,360
like where's the meat I need meat but it

00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:51,740
felt really good and it was even cheaper

00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:54,500
for us to have that then been having

00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:56,030
meat yeah having more variety is always

00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:58,880
hard because you have a lot of leftover

00:26:56,030 --> 00:27:01,370
food and if you can if you can agree on

00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:03,620
some common denominator that would work

00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:07,250
for most people it's cheaper to order

00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:12,380
larger box of the same type of food yeah

00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:16,970
and give us a little like thank you is

00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:18,950
that we had coffee all day so maybe that

00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:21,740
is a standard that we set for the future

00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:24,170
do a concert when you now have coffee

00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:26,120
all day you think about like oh that's

00:27:24,170 --> 00:27:28,100
you know they couldn't do it because

00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:30,290
that was a very important part and we

00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:32,180
also had water and even sparkling water

00:27:30,290 --> 00:27:36,380
which is important in Germany also

00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:38,390
running all pay yeah so we don't have

00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:40,910
much time so communication and we're

00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:43,880
almost just finished I just maybe cover

00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:46,100
you know because he was in terms of our

00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:48,140
communication yeah what we did on-site

00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:50,300
is we did a we did a daily review

00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:52,460
meeting every day and we reviewed what

00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:54,640
went well and what went wrong on the day

00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:57,290
so he could improve for the next day and

00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:59,240
some of the teams were on site and

00:27:57,290 --> 00:28:01,010
improving constantly and things like the

00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:03,100
digital signage that we've had we've

00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:05,810
been improving constantly every day and

00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:07,370
as I said we didn't have an opening or

00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:09,620
closing keynote so we were very active

00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:11,990
through the digital signage and through

00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:14,060
Twitter and other channels to spread the

00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:16,070
messages and that worked quite well we

00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:19,400
could we could involve a lot of people

00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:21,260
and we basically got access to the

00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:23,930
ticket tool silence so if you see the

00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:25,790
ticket I'll sign its things out here so

00:28:23,930 --> 00:28:27,680
what we did is that they told us that we

00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:30,110
could send them what we want to display

00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:33,520
there and we said like no can we send

00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:36,530
you on URL so we sent them on URL and

00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:39,440
obviously with the help of our great

00:28:36,530 --> 00:28:42,140
programmers and the team developers they

00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:43,720
created this amazing thing that we just

00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:46,090
told them what URL

00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:49,450
screen and then we were completely in

00:28:46,090 --> 00:28:50,830
charge of the signage and that was one

00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:52,600
of the things that we got the most out

00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:56,230
of in the end that people said that that

00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:59,350
was very helpful so the full report is a

00:28:56,230 --> 00:29:02,530
thing around 80 pages yeah you can

00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:05,650
really go into detail so theft I state

00:29:02,530 --> 00:29:07,600
this as well it's really important for

00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:08,799
everybody who's organizing a camp go and

00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:10,960
look at it because there's so much

00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:12,730
information in there about tools and

00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:16,480
don'ts and what went well and what was

00:29:12,730 --> 00:29:19,059
difficult so I've made like both the

00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:21,490
issue number but otherwise just ask us

00:29:19,059 --> 00:29:27,330
