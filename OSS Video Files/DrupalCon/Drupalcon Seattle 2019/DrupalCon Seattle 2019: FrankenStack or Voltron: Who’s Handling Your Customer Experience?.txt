Title: DrupalCon Seattle 2019: FrankenStack or Voltron: Who’s Handling Your Customer Experience?
Publication date: 2019-04-11
Playlist: Drupalcon Seattle 2019
Description: 
	Take an honest look at your marketing stack. If it’s a hodgepodge of solutions that don’t talk to each other, you’ve got a FrankenStack. This monster is slow, leaky, and confused - it results in broken digital experiences and literally frightens your customers away. But the answer isn’t ANOTHER tool, it’s in your ability to assemble a stack that communicates, coordinates, and cooperates. When your stack is greater than the sum of its parts, it transforms into Voltron, and enables you to deliver elegant, sophisticated, seamless customer experiences.

In this session, Mautic’s VP of Marketing, Katie Staveley, will teach you how your customer experience relies on the intersection of data and content across your entire stack. And she’ll share real examples of legendary digital experiences teams are enabling across all customer touchpoints. As an attendee, you will learn practical and actionable tips to:

I build marketing campaigns so me I've

00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:02,760
been with modoch for about two and a

00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:04,799
half years as the vp of marketing prior

00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:06,780
to that I had worked for a number of b2b

00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,790
marketing companies or software

00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:09,510
companies including aqueous I was there

00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:12,270
for a couple years

00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:14,549
early on when the company started so

00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:17,939
I've been a DrupalCon before but the

00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:20,909
first time here with modoch my focus is

00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:24,600
primarily demand gen and content aside

00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:26,820
from that I have a lot of experience

00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:29,340
using marketing technology solutions

00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:31,200
power user of modoch naturally after you

00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:32,159
know that's our solution but I've used a

00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,990
number of different other marketing

00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,840
automation platforms and Salesforce and

00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:38,939
other CRM and things like that so a lot

00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:42,869
of depth of experience handling these

00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:45,750
types of tools so what we're going to

00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:47,159
talk about today in today's agenda we're

00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:49,710
going to do a little bit of a level set

00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:50,700
on the context how I think about or how

00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:53,159
I'm going to talk about customer

00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:54,990
experience I'm going to talk a little

00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:57,479
bit about the Marr tech landscape that

00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:59,310
was released last week at the bar tech

00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:00,479
conference I'm sure that Scott probably

00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:01,770
talked a little bit about that in his

00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:03,960
session I didn't catch it this morning

00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:06,659
but I'm sure he covered that I'm just

00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:07,799
going to sort of to give my take on you

00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:10,110
know how that applies to this

00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:12,840
conversation provide a few practical

00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:14,820
tips for you know evaluating solutions

00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:17,100
for your tea

00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:18,420
and then a few takeaways on how to

00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:23,370
deliver a more personalized experience

00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:26,070
across your brand so let's get to it

00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:28,070
so so customer experience this is a

00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:30,270
topic that continues to hold momentum

00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:31,560
you know in our industry everybody's

00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:32,880
talking about it everybody's trying to

00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:35,460
figure out what it means what it means

00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:37,260
for their organization you know and that

00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:39,540
we what we've observed is that you know

00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:41,760
marketers they want to create memorable

00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:43,260
great experiences for their customers

00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,230
right we all want want to be on that

00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:48,120
page you know you want your customers to

00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:50,640
keep coming back and really engaging

00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:51,990
with your brand purchasing more of what

00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,270
you're selling you know providing

00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:56,640
reviews and feedback speaking highly of

00:02:54,270 --> 00:03:00,990
you when you talk to their friends and

00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:03,180
customers and peers but what I've also

00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:06,180
observed along the way here is that it's

00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:07,440
really hard to achieve one of the and I

00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:09,240
believe that one of the leading

00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,970
inhibitors actually is our technology

00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:13,860
choices which are directly impacting you

00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:15,270
know thousands impacted by all the

00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:17,310
thousands of tools in that Mar tech

00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:19,320
landscape trying to puzzle them together

00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:21,000
into a highly functioning stack and then

00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:23,070
couple that with highly functioning

00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,540
teams that know how to use those and

00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:26,430
make them work together in a way that's

00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:31,500
you know delivering a well-oiled machine

00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:33,240
for your organization so if we take a

00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,680
little bit of time to kind of peel away

00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:36,480
the onion

00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:38,750
you know we've established the customer

00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:41,400
experience already as the linchpin to

00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:43,380
you know creating differentiation and

00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:46,170
sustained defensibility within your

00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:49,650
within today's experience economy so

00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:51,960
that's great we all agree right you know

00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:53,820
but let's talk about what happens you

00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:55,470
know when the customer experience

00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:57,090
happens it's not when they receive your

00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:58,680
marketing promo emails right we can all

00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:01,620
send emails but is that the only time

00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:02,730
that they're experiencing your brand you

00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:04,290
know it's every time they visit your

00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:05,970
website or anytime they've made their

00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:07,020
first purchase it's each and every one

00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:08,310
of the touch points that they're

00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:10,350
engaging with your brand every

00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:13,920
interaction every conversation you know

00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:15,750
today tomorrow and every day forward you

00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:18,030
know and I think that if I were to pull

00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:19,170
the audience here today that building

00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:21,120
the kind of a relationship with your

00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:23,850
customers over and over time is

00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,320
important to your business in each of

00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:27,030
the conversations and interactions are

00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:28,370
opportunities to create a

00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:30,630
positive experience for your customers

00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:34,170
so they become building blocks for that

00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:36,210
relationship relationship so if we think

00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:38,310
about what does it really mean to build

00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:39,660
a relationship with your customers right

00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:42,720
first and foremost you want to build a

00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:43,440
healthy relationship and with a two-way

00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,360
dialogue

00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,860
it can't be one-sided you can't just be

00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,270
talking at your customers all the time

00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:50,070
about things that you want to talk about

00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:51,330
it has to be a combination of what you

00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:53,250
want to talk about and what they want to

00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:54,570
talk about you want to give them ways to

00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:56,370
connect with you and have a conversation

00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:57,930
with you and tell you what their

00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:59,970
interests are what their needs are and

00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:02,340
you know how you can be more helpful to

00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:05,370
them it's also an exchange of value

00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:07,919
right it's not just again you know us

00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:10,950
taking from from them as you know

00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:13,110
providers or solution providers or you

00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:15,240
know vendors it's an exchange we want to

00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:16,740
make sure that we're giving and getting

00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:19,800
at the same time so whether that's

00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:21,570
giving with you know new content or

00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,250
offers or things that could be useful to

00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:25,320
them you know even as simple as

00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:27,210
answering their questions but it's also

00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:29,580
you know as we're asking for things for

00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:31,110
them from them right you know asking

00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:32,910
them to buy more product or asking them

00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:34,410
to you know provide more information

00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:37,080
about what their interests are and

00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:39,630
things it also is those little things

00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:42,419
that make a difference in saying thank

00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:44,580
you when they download an asset or you

00:05:42,419 --> 00:05:47,690
know giving them an offer when they

00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:50,100
provide feedback on your solution and

00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:51,630
lastly relationships are about getting

00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:53,280
to know who they are and recognizing

00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:55,229
those customers when they come back so

00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,460
interacting with them in the context and

00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:57,900
knowledge so they don't feel like a

00:05:56,460 --> 00:06:00,419
stranger every time they interact with

00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:02,550
you and so imagine you know I sort of

00:06:00,419 --> 00:06:04,260
equate it to real life right so imagine

00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:06,060
that you had this person that you met

00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:07,800
you know let's say you met here at your

00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:09,180
book on and you shook hands and had a

00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,860
coffee and learned a little bit about

00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:12,120
each other and then you see him at the

00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:14,130
next dribble meet up and they have no

00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:15,510
idea who you are right they forget they

00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:16,979
don't remember your conversation okay

00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:18,930
you reintroduce yourself oh yeah we met

00:06:16,979 --> 00:06:19,979
a triple con and then you meet again and

00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:21,030
they still don't know who you are they

00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:22,710
don't remember you they don't remember

00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:24,479
your conversation after a while you're

00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:26,490
sort of like why am I even bothering

00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:28,260
with this person you totally write them

00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:29,760
off right it's not different with your

00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:31,560
brand you want to make sure that you're

00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:33,180
engaging with your customers and the way

00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:34,560
that you want to engage in real life you

00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:36,300
know have a conversation build a

00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,430
relationship make sure that you're

00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:40,420
adding as much value as much as you know

00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:42,520
they're taking from you

00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:44,170
you know when when companies fall short

00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:45,910
of building that type of personalized

00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:47,470
experience they become selfish and

00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:49,060
inconsiderate right just the way that

00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:51,460
person who you've interacted with and

00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:52,900
that you know fake scenario you know

00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:54,820
becomes you know feels a little bit

00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:57,130
inconsiderate to you to you and to your

00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:58,840
needs and you risk becoming that

00:06:57,130 --> 00:07:00,970
annoying friend that nobody ever wants

00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:02,800
to talk to you because you know you know

00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:04,630
it's never once two-sided it's always

00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:09,610
one-sided it's always their perspective

00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:12,130
or their interests and so if we switch

00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:14,140
gears for a second we talked a little

00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:15,130
bit about building relationships and and

00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:16,870
hopefully you're sitting there saying

00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:19,030
yeah yeah that's absolutely what we want

00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:20,470
to do for our customers and the next

00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:21,760
logical step I know if I was sitting

00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:25,060
there I'd be like okay how do I do that

00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:26,560
what do I do you know I have to start by

00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:27,910
saying there is no silver bullet you

00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,740
know in marketing we want that one thing

00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:31,150
that's gonna be that great campaign or

00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:33,400
that great piece of content that's just

00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:35,320
gonna you know get the you know the the

00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:36,790
great results then the sales team is

00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:39,760
gonna say I love you marketing and they

00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:42,070
never do but you know we have to think

00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:44,920
really smart about how important your

00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:47,410
tech stack it plays a role in you know

00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:50,380
building those relationships so this is

00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:52,930
you know just off of I took a look at

00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:54,670
Scott's blog post from last week from

00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:56,320
our tech and you know I can't I can't

00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:58,450
not I personally cannot believe that

00:07:56,320 --> 00:08:01,270
we're now up to over 7,000 different

00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:03,160
solutions you know I run marketing for a

00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:05,740
company the thought of me having to

00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:08,470
evaluate 7,000 solutions is completely

00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:10,480
insane and so you know as we think about

00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:12,610
having to deal with all of those

00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:13,690
different solutions and and frankly you

00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:15,010
know one of the things he pointed out

00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:16,180
that I thought was really interesting is

00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:17,950
that doesn't even clued all the point

00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:21,040
solutions so if I'm vertically oriented

00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:22,480
around health care or you know higher ed

00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:24,100
you know there's even a whole other

00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:27,850
subset of solutions that aren't even

00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:29,620
included on that that graph but you know

00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:30,640
the way that I see it is that we have

00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:32,440
all this technology at our fingertips

00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:34,120
but things are just becoming more and

00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:36,550
more complex where technology should be

00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:38,200
making them easier and easier and so we

00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:39,700
have to be really smart about how we're

00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:41,979
managing that technology and what we're

00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:43,210
really doing with it you know I I wonder

00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:44,980
if we're gonna get to a point as

00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:47,170
marketers having to have one person's

00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:49,839
whose sole job is to just manage

00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:52,120
technology evaluating reevaluating

00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:53,810
negotiating contracts making sure we're

00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:56,840
optimizing making sure we're using it

00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:58,610
efficiently you know it makes it there's

00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:03,620
so much of it out there that it makes it

00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:05,510
really difficult to to think about and

00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:07,640
so one of the one quick stat that we had

00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:09,230
come across recently is that 3% of

00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:10,610
marketers believe that they're totally

00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:14,089
connected and aligned across their

00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:16,580
systems 3% so we take a step back and we

00:09:14,089 --> 00:09:17,690
think about this mark tech stack which

00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:19,370
you can see kind of in the background

00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:23,000
there all of those different solutions

00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:25,130
and then you know we get to this and

00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,510
it's like well yeah of course how could

00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:28,400
I possibly make sure that all these

00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:30,080
things are seamless and working you know

00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:31,520
I have one team using this tool and

00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,140
another team using that email tool and

00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:35,000
another team using a CMS and another

00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:36,410
team using social it's really

00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,810
challenging to pull these things

00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:40,760
together so if we take a step back and

00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:42,380
say okay we really want good experiences

00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:44,810
for our customers yep check that's

00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:47,320
that's on our list good experiences

00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:49,520
depend on relationships yep absolutely

00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:51,400
relationships are formed in two-way

00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:54,560
dialogue you know exchanging value

00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:56,360
understanding personalization we use

00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:59,330
technology CMS's marketing automation

00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:02,060
CDP CRM so on and so forth to facilitate

00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:03,230
those experiences at scale otherwise we

00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:05,720
can just do it one-to-one and hire

00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:06,980
somebody to do that and only 3% of

00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:08,839
marketers believe their system or

00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:12,320
systems are adequately adequately

00:10:08,839 --> 00:10:14,360
connected it's really it's astonishing

00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,100
and it almost feels like it should be

00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:17,870
wrong but you know thinking about that

00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:19,490
landscape and how internal teams work

00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:20,900
together across the organization with

00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:25,070
the technology it doesn't really seem

00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:27,560
that surprising and so for saying that

00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:29,540
the customer experience owner depends on

00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:31,100
our internal systems talking across the

00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:32,720
organization we have to take a step back

00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:35,720
and evaluate who's really handling our

00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:37,910
customer experience is it this guy right

00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:40,010
is it you know is it Franken stack who's

00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:42,350
walking around and sort of held together

00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:44,690
with some so you know sewed up arms and

00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:46,670
buttoned on legs and you know however

00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:48,620
the monster was created with a little

00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:51,680
bit of electricity I don't know the full

00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:53,000
story but something like that right you

00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:55,550
know loosely connecting your tools

00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,080
across your organization you know can

00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:59,600
oftentimes be more trouble than good

00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:01,250
right and the results are you know first

00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,530
and foremost in efficiency isn't data

00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:05,360
sharing right you might have really good

00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:07,310
rich data in your you know your data

00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,459
warehouse but it's not talking talking

00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:09,170
to

00:11:07,459 --> 00:11:10,399
your marketing automation platform so

00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:11,779
now you can't even trigger campaigns

00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:14,089
based on the things that are most

00:11:11,779 --> 00:11:15,379
important to your customers so when

00:11:14,089 --> 00:11:16,910
those things aren't talking you're just

00:11:15,379 --> 00:11:18,829
not your organization is not

00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:21,259
capitalizing on your investment in that

00:11:18,829 --> 00:11:22,819
area you know there's always the

00:11:21,259 --> 00:11:24,410
potential of the collision of data

00:11:22,819 --> 00:11:26,689
between those tools right if you get

00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:28,550
into the circular circular motion

00:11:26,689 --> 00:11:29,749
between your CRM and your marketing

00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:31,220
automation and your ecommerce platform

00:11:29,749 --> 00:11:33,199
and those things are not really

00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:35,329
seamlessly laid out or connected in the

00:11:33,199 --> 00:11:37,129
right way you can ever done and see you

00:11:35,329 --> 00:11:40,309
can over writing of data you run into a

00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:41,540
lot of challenges you know when those

00:11:40,309 --> 00:11:43,689
things aren't really working together

00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:46,220
hand-in-hand

00:11:43,689 --> 00:11:47,660
typically in in a situation where you

00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:50,509
have a frank and stack dominating

00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:53,029
there's a lot of high resistance to

00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:54,709
change there's in flexibility so when

00:11:53,029 --> 00:11:56,089
you when your business grows and you're

00:11:54,709 --> 00:11:58,490
you know you enter a new market you

00:11:56,089 --> 00:12:00,679
bring a new product to the market what

00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:02,059
you're finding is that my tools really

00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:03,860
are just not doing what I need them to

00:12:02,059 --> 00:12:05,209
do right I have this idea I want to do

00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:06,559
this this and this and I can't do it

00:12:05,209 --> 00:12:09,439
because what I have today is totally

00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:11,179
inflexible it ends up being an

00:12:09,439 --> 00:12:12,649
individual sport instead of a team sport

00:12:11,179 --> 00:12:14,089
right so when you have all these

00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:15,980
disparate technologies sort of held

00:12:14,089 --> 00:12:16,850
together you have different teams that

00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:18,649
are running them with different

00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:20,420
initiatives and different MBOs and

00:12:18,649 --> 00:12:22,220
different things that are motivating

00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:23,899
them and driving them and so how could

00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:25,339
it possibly be a team sport when you

00:12:23,899 --> 00:12:26,689
have all these individual groups and

00:12:25,339 --> 00:12:28,759
what you really want is all those things

00:12:26,689 --> 00:12:30,649
working together because it is a team

00:12:28,759 --> 00:12:32,509
sport it has to in order to deliver to

00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:34,759
customer experience appropriately and

00:12:32,509 --> 00:12:38,929
adequately it has to be all those things

00:12:34,759 --> 00:12:39,949
working seamlessly and it really makes

00:12:38,929 --> 00:12:41,899
it difficult for you to truly

00:12:39,949 --> 00:12:43,490
personalize the experience you might be

00:12:41,899 --> 00:12:45,439
able to truly you might be able to

00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:47,899
personalize some sets of that experience

00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:49,790
so maybe on the web or maybe in you know

00:12:47,899 --> 00:12:51,709
your email maybe in a few different ways

00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:53,299
but you really can't truly personalize

00:12:51,709 --> 00:12:55,069
and build a real relationship the way

00:12:53,299 --> 00:12:57,249
that again in real life that it would be

00:12:55,069 --> 00:13:00,019
meaningful to you as an individual

00:12:57,249 --> 00:13:03,799
without bringing those things together

00:13:00,019 --> 00:13:05,269
and the one thing that you know we

00:13:03,799 --> 00:13:06,889
consistently see over and over again

00:13:05,269 --> 00:13:09,589
particularly on the marketing automation

00:13:06,889 --> 00:13:10,910
side of things is that oftentimes what

00:13:09,589 --> 00:13:12,860
companies are doing is they're

00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:14,089
compromising right and the compromises

00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:16,429
in a healthy compromise it's a

00:13:14,089 --> 00:13:18,259
compromise in the way that you let your

00:13:16,429 --> 00:13:19,699
technology lead your process rather than

00:13:18,259 --> 00:13:21,560
you leading your process and letting

00:13:19,699 --> 00:13:23,180
your technology follow suit

00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:24,920
so you're following their play books and

00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:26,149
their recipes and things like that but

00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:27,860
what you really should be doing is

00:13:26,149 --> 00:13:29,449
saying no in my organization for my

00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:31,430
customers it should look like this

00:13:29,449 --> 00:13:35,959
and my technology should support it in

00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:37,730
this way and on the flip side we have

00:13:35,959 --> 00:13:40,389
Voltron right and everybody know who

00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:43,449
Voltron is you know I'm sort of old so

00:13:40,389 --> 00:13:46,639
right so cartoon from many years ago

00:13:43,449 --> 00:13:48,110
Voltron is the combination of robot

00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:49,819
warriors who come together and build

00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:51,019
this like super robot that saves the

00:13:49,819 --> 00:13:52,370
world and he's super awesome and

00:13:51,019 --> 00:13:55,249
everybody loves him and he's a super

00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:57,470
hero so you know when we think about you

00:13:55,249 --> 00:13:59,720
know pulling together um our txtag

00:13:57,470 --> 00:14:01,249
Voltron is really should be the role

00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:02,600
model right it's it's you're coming

00:14:01,249 --> 00:14:04,550
together and these things are coming in

00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:06,410
together in a way that the sum of the

00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:09,499
parts is bigger than they're individuals

00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:11,749
right and so you know we oftentimes

00:14:09,499 --> 00:14:13,309
think about at least in my perspective

00:14:11,749 --> 00:14:15,079
we think about marketing first and

00:14:13,309 --> 00:14:16,309
market extact first but really what you

00:14:15,079 --> 00:14:18,290
should be thinking about is your tools

00:14:16,309 --> 00:14:20,300
across all of your different teams right

00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:21,740
your what tools are your sales teams

00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:23,480
using well tools are your product team

00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:25,579
using you know what tools are they is

00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:27,019
your are your support teams using and

00:14:25,579 --> 00:14:28,939
how are they talking to each other in a

00:14:27,019 --> 00:14:32,000
way that you can then turn that into to

00:14:28,939 --> 00:14:33,620
Voltron instead of Franken stack you

00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,939
know by creating you know by pulling

00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:38,120
these things together you're creating a

00:14:34,939 --> 00:14:40,550
powerful force you can you know in a

00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:42,709
situation where it's Voltron dominating

00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:44,689
you can pivot quickly you can move fast

00:14:42,709 --> 00:14:45,889
and say okay as your business grows as

00:14:44,689 --> 00:14:47,990
you're bringing those products to market

00:14:45,889 --> 00:14:49,819
you should be able to move quickly you

00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:52,699
know to deliver that vision that you

00:14:49,819 --> 00:14:55,129
you're you want to achieve you can

00:14:52,699 --> 00:14:56,750
easily recover from downtime with stable

00:14:55,129 --> 00:14:58,459
and resilient technology you're not

00:14:56,750 --> 00:15:00,199
waiting you know days and days and days

00:14:58,459 --> 00:15:02,059
for stuff to be fixed because you had a

00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:03,500
special developer code a few things to

00:15:02,059 --> 00:15:05,209
make those work together if they're

00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:07,759
working seamlessly you can recover

00:15:05,209 --> 00:15:09,500
quickly you can get as close as

00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:11,660
real-time as possible we have a customer

00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:15,050
who you know they use marketing

00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:17,920
automation to promote offers on ski ski

00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:20,179
resorts so their mountain and so as

00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:21,439
customers that they recognize check in

00:15:20,179 --> 00:15:22,699
and buy a daily ticket they're

00:15:21,439 --> 00:15:24,350
immediately sending them information

00:15:22,699 --> 00:15:25,970
about whether they're sending them

00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:28,730
information about signing up for an

00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:30,259
annual ticket so immediately as that

00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:32,300
data is coming through they're sharing

00:15:30,259 --> 00:15:33,679
it with their customers it's because

00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:35,120
they have that seamless stack and they

00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:37,070
can pull those things together and

00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,680
and make it meaningful at the right time

00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:41,570
the right message to the right person

00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:43,520
and really it allows you to be flexible

00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:45,560
and create a truly customized or a

00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:51,020
personalized experience for your

00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:53,260
customers and so one thing that you know

00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:56,270
when I think about cons I think about

00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:57,440
Voltron I oftentimes see customers want

00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:59,089
to jump to consolidation and

00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,620
consolidation is great you know we all

00:15:59,089 --> 00:16:02,330
want to you want we all want a few less

00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:03,560
tools in our stack particularly get rid

00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:06,020
of those tools that really aren't doing

00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:08,089
much for us and that that that's

00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:09,710
definitely a healthy conversation but

00:16:08,089 --> 00:16:11,450
you know I would caution you to remember

00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:13,339
that it's it's not the Silver Bullet

00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:15,950
just because you consolidate to one tool

00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:17,720
or one group of tools or one you know

00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:20,360
vendor that's not always the right

00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:22,930
answer you know it really depends on

00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:25,130
your organization and really taking that

00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:27,290
to heart and understanding what are we

00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:28,640
what are we trying to do our business is

00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:30,020
unique compared to our competitors

00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:32,029
compared to other people in the industry

00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:33,830
compared to other industries what's

00:16:32,029 --> 00:16:36,950
unique to us and what kind of technology

00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:38,540
do we need to support that streamlining

00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:40,459
some of those solutions can help though

00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:42,290
right so while you're not consolidating

00:16:40,459 --> 00:16:43,370
your entire stack maybe there's a few

00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:44,930
things where you're like okay there's a

00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:46,520
lot of overlap between this and that

00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:49,400
maybe we can consolidate those two

00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:50,570
things and you know we we often see this

00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:52,339
and we're you know I'm a little bit

00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:53,750
biased in this way because we're

00:16:52,339 --> 00:16:55,640
marketing automation platform and the

00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:56,600
platform's fairly robust in a lot of

00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:58,520
ways there's a lot of feature

00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:59,810
functionality you know we have these

00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:01,580
conversations where somebody has a

00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:03,110
landing page tool and a social tool and

00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:04,579
an email tool and I'm like okay well we

00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:06,079
can we can bring those all into one

00:17:04,579 --> 00:17:08,179
thing that doesn't mean we want to be

00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:09,350
your CRM and your e-commerce platform

00:17:08,179 --> 00:17:11,540
and everything else you're trying to do

00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:13,220
but it does help you narrow down some of

00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:16,160
those things and make it a little bit

00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:17,569
more manageable and again it should

00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,860
support your business you shouldn't be

00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:22,339
forced fitting something into your

00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:24,199
business and you know relying on their

00:17:22,339 --> 00:17:25,790
process that some product manager at

00:17:24,199 --> 00:17:27,589
some software company came up with it

00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:30,470
should be your process and what you know

00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:32,000
is unique to you guys and you should be

00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:34,130
looking for flexibility and openness

00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,080
right and today's you know software

00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:37,820
development you know ten years ago

00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,470
nothing was open and nothing was

00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:40,970
flexible it was like you followed this

00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:43,100
and this is how it works and these how

00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:45,830
this how these systems talk but today

00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:47,750
you know software is is being built with

00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:48,950
flexibility and openness in mind and so

00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:50,660
as you're looking for new salut

00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:51,890
that should be on your checklist you

00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:54,020
should be asking that question you

00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:54,530
should be asking the vendors how do you

00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:57,740
do that

00:17:54,530 --> 00:18:01,280
in what ways literally that can help you

00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:05,960
be more effective with your with your

00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:06,950
solutions and with your go-to-market so

00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:08,570
now that you're thinking differently

00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:10,250
about technology let's talk a little bit

00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:13,040
more about how you can be strategic with

00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:15,170
personalization so that definition at

00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:16,520
the top personalization is a means for

00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:18,460
meeting the customer needs more

00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:20,570
efficiently and effectively that's a

00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:22,750
definition I got off the tech target

00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:24,800
site actually it's not something I wrote

00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:26,240
it's I thought it was a pretty good

00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:29,360
description of how we might want to

00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:31,220
think about personalization so really

00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,960
the way that I often will talk about it

00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:37,960
is how do you cross the bridge from

00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:41,480
digital to connect each individual

00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:44,030
connect to each individual digitally and

00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:45,470
so you know things as simple as meeting

00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:48,530
and greeting your audience when people

00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:49,970
return you know it's me you track me

00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:51,110
with cookies and everything else like

00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:53,330
You Know Who I am

00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:55,220
when I come back you know it's okay to

00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:57,950
say my name my name's Katie say hello

00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:59,570
right that's okay you know learn about

00:18:57,950 --> 00:19:02,180
their interests you know if it's

00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:03,740
implicit great if it's explicit even

00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:05,210
better tell me tell me what you're

00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:06,380
interested in tell me what you like tell

00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:07,550
me what you want to hear about what you

00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:09,260
don't want to hear about tell me how you

00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:10,520
want to hear about it if you never ever

00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:12,560
want me to send you an email but you

00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:15,710
love text messages great I'm happy to

00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:17,210
send you a text message you know share

00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:19,340
helpful content and offers that are

00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:21,170
interesting to them right we often as

00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:23,900
marketers have a habit of falling into

00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:25,040
the oh so did you hear about me did you

00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:26,420
hear about my solution and what I did

00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:28,880
and all these things about me me me

00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:30,470
right and so we have to always always

00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:32,090
remember and this is you know this is

00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:33,560
not something that's new I hope to

00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:34,880
anybody in the room but you know always

00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:37,700
remember that it should be about them

00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:39,050
and what their interests are you know

00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:41,050
most importantly a personalized

00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:43,100
experience does build trust and loyalty

00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:44,960
which is what we want to build those

00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:46,280
relationships and at the end of the day

00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,440
we can never forget that we're selling

00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:50,090
to people individuals you know and so

00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:53,090
our job should be how do I talk to

00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:57,280
people not talk to you know IP address

00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:57,280
14.3 dot six that whatever

00:19:58,050 --> 00:20:03,040
so I thought I'd throw a few ways that

00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:04,960
you can sort of apply personalization

00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:06,610
pretty quickly so these are things that

00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,860
we share the tips that we share with our

00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:11,020
customers oftentimes where they can just

00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:13,240
take personalization and get going on it

00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:15,370
right away so we often joke about you

00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:17,350
know when we talk to some customers

00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:19,420
their idea of personalization is hello

00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:21,790
first name right of course the standard

00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:23,050
email opening and a little bit of code

00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:25,090
you put in your emails to make sure you

00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:26,920
get that right I will say that I get a

00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:28,870
lot of emails from people that I'm a

00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:31,420
customer of that do not say my first

00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:33,130
name they just say hey there which I

00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:35,380
find to be as a marketing automation

00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:42,190
provider I find out to be really

00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:42,910
annoying but that's just me I would

00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:46,750
agree with that

00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:48,040
you have been there yeah so a couple of

00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:49,240
different ways that you know we often

00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:50,830
talk about it one of which is

00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:53,530
segmentation so when we talk about

00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:55,930
segments within the platform it's more

00:20:53,530 --> 00:20:57,400
than just you know segment by okay

00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:59,110
anybody in the United States that's

00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:00,880
great that's a great starting point so

00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:03,280
geography is one way another way is

00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,960
demographic what how granular can you

00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:06,460
get around some of these segments that

00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,890
you can really deliver a message that's

00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:10,450
relevant to them other types of

00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:12,400
segmentation that we often talk about

00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:14,290
with our customers you know demographic

00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:17,280
Pharma graphic affinity and interest

00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:21,250
like we have a customer who sells

00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:24,280
interactive books stories through Amazon

00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:26,110
Alexa and so you know they have a big

00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:27,550
database of understanding who their

00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:29,800
customers are what their interests are

00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:32,380
do they like thrillers do they like you

00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:34,840
know romantic stories things like that

00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:36,160
so really pulling that information in so

00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:37,780
that you can segment and get really

00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:40,180
granular around how you're delivering

00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:41,530
those messages looking at past behavior

00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:42,970
what have they done what haven't they

00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:44,200
done what do you want them to do next

00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:46,390
what do you think would be helpful for

00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:47,740
them to do next so leveraging some of

00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:49,630
that past behavior whether its web

00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:51,370
behavior whether that's you know are

00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:52,780
they clicking on your emails have they

00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:54,610
talked to your sales team have they

00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:57,220
contacted your support team all of those

00:21:54,610 --> 00:21:58,570
count and then again thinking about real

00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:59,950
time behavior or what do you what can

00:21:58,570 --> 00:22:01,390
you know immediately that you can effect

00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:03,760
a message immediately for them so that

00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:05,080
they really feel like okay I'm a person

00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:08,320
and they recognize me and they know who

00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:10,650
I am the next area is thinking about

00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:12,870
dynamic content and so we talk

00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:14,520
dynamic content not only in emails so

00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:17,010
it's an email that you might want to

00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:18,990
switch out a segment of the the content

00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:20,490
that it'll incorporate a little bit of

00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:22,170
set that segmentation so if it's a

00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:23,880
customer you want might want to talk to

00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:26,010
them differently if it's a c-level

00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:27,330
executive versus a director level

00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:28,470
executive you might want to talk to each

00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:31,050
of those a little bit differently with

00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:32,970
your message maybe your offer and using

00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:34,740
dynamic content not only in your emails

00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:36,060
but also on your website I'm sure a lot

00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:37,680
of you are thinking about that already

00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:40,140
today it's a big topic I think here at

00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:41,880
Drupal con but you know really thinking

00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:44,610
about how you can engage your audience

00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:46,410
further with you know using that dynamic

00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:48,060
content on your website it's getting

00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:50,070
easier and easier to do the tools are

00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:51,780
out there so it's really about okay

00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:52,830
creating that vision for yourself and

00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:55,800
for your team and what you want to

00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:57,690
deliver and then acting on it using

00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:59,490
multiple channels so I talked about this

00:22:57,690 --> 00:23:01,710
as you know getting outside the inbox

00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:03,180
right using other channels and it's

00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:05,220
funny because I think some of us are

00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:06,420
reluctant particularly on b2b marketing

00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:08,100
to kind of look at other channels like

00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:09,570
emails the channel that's the channel

00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:11,280
then you have your website that's great

00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:12,480
okay so now we can do a little bit more

00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:14,100
with website but we're really

00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,260
encouraging customers just think even

00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:18,570
broadly how are using text messages are

00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:20,520
you using text messages are using mobile

00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:22,500
app notifications can you do this all in

00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:24,090
the same platform can you pull all these

00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:26,730
things together so it does feel like a

00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:28,830
seamless experience you know and one of

00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:30,810
the things that I often encourage is you

00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:33,540
know thinking beyond those channels test

00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:36,450
everything and don't assume anything you

00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:37,950
know in b2b we were usually saying okay

00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:40,320
text meant there's no way our customers

00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:42,120
are gonna respond to text but I don't

00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:45,870
know try it see what happens see if they

00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:47,700
react to it and last but not least we're

00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:49,620
actually managing preferences letting

00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:51,240
them set up their preferences and tell

00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:53,340
you you know when they want to hear from

00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:55,110
you how they want to hear from you and

00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:56,550
keeping those up to date so that you're

00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:57,510
giving them the messages when they want

00:23:56,550 --> 00:23:59,610
to hear them and how they want to hear

00:23:57,510 --> 00:24:03,380
them and then miss machine-learning I

00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:03,380
kind of joke about this with my little

00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:08,460
bullet there but really it's thinking

00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:09,900
about how how can we it's it's early on

00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:11,490
but how do we start adopting machine

00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:13,440
learning to interpret some of these

00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:15,180
things for us understanding okay well

00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,830
this person they they open emails all

00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:18,660
the time okay well I think that's their

00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:20,100
preferred channel let's let's in you

00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:20,520
know implicitly understand that that's

00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:23,250
what it is

00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:24,509
whereas you know or other things like

00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:26,190
they like to receive

00:24:24,509 --> 00:24:28,199
at this time of day they never read

00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:31,079
stuff on Friday afternoons who does

00:24:28,199 --> 00:24:35,249
right so really thinking about some of

00:24:31,079 --> 00:24:37,949
those things as well so just to wrap it

00:24:35,249 --> 00:24:40,949
up couple of key takeaways creating

00:24:37,949 --> 00:24:42,329
memorable memorable experience for you

00:24:40,949 --> 00:24:43,769
know our customers is mission critical

00:24:42,329 --> 00:24:46,169
we all have to be thinking about this

00:24:43,769 --> 00:24:47,669
every day it doesn't have to be boil the

00:24:46,169 --> 00:24:50,039
ocean but it you know starting to pick

00:24:47,669 --> 00:24:53,129
away at that day by day is I think going

00:24:50,039 --> 00:24:55,440
to be important for all of us positive

00:24:53,129 --> 00:24:56,699
experiences depend on relationships so

00:24:55,440 --> 00:25:00,059
building those relationships with your

00:24:56,699 --> 00:25:02,069
customers is is really critical again

00:25:00,059 --> 00:25:03,509
relationships are forms in you know a

00:25:02,069 --> 00:25:06,869
couple of different ways two-way

00:25:03,509 --> 00:25:09,690
dialogue you know exchanging a value and

00:25:06,869 --> 00:25:12,179
then delivering that personalization be

00:25:09,690 --> 00:25:13,769
smart with your technology choices they

00:25:12,179 --> 00:25:15,629
should be a force multiplier and not a

00:25:13,769 --> 00:25:16,949
deterrent right thinking about it like

00:25:15,629 --> 00:25:18,509
how is this gonna make me that much

00:25:16,949 --> 00:25:20,699
better how's my team gonna be that much

00:25:18,509 --> 00:25:21,869
more efficient but above all that how

00:25:20,699 --> 00:25:23,999
does this help me deliver a better

00:25:21,869 --> 00:25:25,349
customer experience for my customers how

00:25:23,999 --> 00:25:27,569
am I gonna engage with them even better

00:25:25,349 --> 00:25:29,279
and give them what they want and then

00:25:27,569 --> 00:25:30,299
last but not least personalizing more

00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:31,949
than just first name

00:25:30,299 --> 00:25:33,899
I think personalization is going to be

00:25:31,949 --> 00:25:35,789
such a critical factor for this

00:25:33,899 --> 00:25:36,989
experience you know building a good

00:25:35,789 --> 00:25:37,769
experience down the road for your

00:25:36,989 --> 00:25:39,329
customers

00:25:37,769 --> 00:25:41,069
so really starting to think about okay

00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:42,509
what can we do today and tomorrow and

00:25:41,069 --> 00:25:44,369
the next day again it doesn't have to be

00:25:42,509 --> 00:25:46,909
all at once but starting with the

00:25:44,369 --> 00:25:49,259
attitude of you know taking action there

00:25:46,909 --> 00:25:51,539
so that's all I have I just a few

00:25:49,259 --> 00:25:52,889
reminders as asked by DrupalCon us you

00:25:51,539 --> 00:25:55,949
know remember to check out these

00:25:52,889 --> 00:25:57,509
contribution opportunities fill out the

00:25:55,949 --> 00:25:59,609
survey I'm sure you guys have seen these

00:25:57,509 --> 00:26:03,869
slides hopefully maybe I'm not the only

00:25:59,609 --> 00:26:05,099
one and that's it so I'm here if you

00:26:03,869 --> 00:26:06,419
want to ask any questions and then we

00:26:05,099 --> 00:26:08,369
have a table downstairs but I know it's

00:26:06,419 --> 00:26:09,690
lunchtime so I won't feel offended if

00:26:08,369 --> 00:26:12,340
you guys bolt out of here and go get

00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:16,910
some food thanks

00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:16,910
