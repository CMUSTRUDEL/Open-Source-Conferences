Oh everybody thank you for coming out to

00:00:03,149 --> 00:00:08,250
see this session I'm gonna be talking

00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:10,440
about web ops if you were not familiar

00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:14,460
with the term web ops hopefully after

00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:16,650
the next 25 minutes you will be and my

00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:20,910
goal is to also help you understand how

00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:23,250
Web Apps can help you with your web team

00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:25,590
Drive agile transformation within the

00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:26,849
marketing organization before I get into

00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:30,109
the content let me just share a little

00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:32,489
bit about my background so I was

00:00:30,109 --> 00:00:34,079
introduced to agile pretty early on in

00:00:32,489 --> 00:00:35,610
my career I spent most of the early part

00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,320
of my career working at startups working

00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:40,410
very closely with product management

00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:42,780
software engineering teams they were by

00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:45,840
default using agile practices at that

00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:47,579
time and that way of working really

00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,289
impressed me I had an opportunity to

00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:52,890
apply that in the marketing function I

00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:54,960
had a lot of good results and I wanted

00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:57,030
to share that experience with other

00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,469
marketers so I ended up writing a book

00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:59,940
about the topic called the agile

00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:03,510
marketer and I interviewed a lot of

00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:05,760
marketers for that book I also co-host a

00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:08,760
podcast called the marketing agility

00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:11,130
podcast where I've talked with hundreds

00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:14,970
of marketers in many different contexts

00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:17,939
whether it's b2b or b2c big companies

00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:22,170
small companies and also folks in other

00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:24,509
ecosystem players like Venn tool vendors

00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:25,409
and agencies and consultancy so a lot of

00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:27,659
what I'm going to share with you today

00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:32,189
is based on that research and based on

00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:33,869
those conversations so let's start just

00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:37,170
by talking about why is it that

00:01:33,869 --> 00:01:40,560
marketers are so obsessed with agile

00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:42,659
marketing or with agile a lot of it

00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,899
comes down to the fact that well so one

00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:47,460
thing the average tenure of a CMO is 18

00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:49,140
months and dropping right so we need to

00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:51,869
find ways of putting points on the board

00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:55,649
really quickly agile is a mechanism to

00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:57,630
do that at the same time we're

00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:59,009
increasingly in a position where we we

00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:01,860
don't necessarily know what's going to

00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:03,180
work in advance no amount of advanced

00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:05,460
analysis is going to tell us what's

00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:08,099
gonna work so we need to address that

00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:09,750
somehow and then the last thing is that

00:02:08,099 --> 00:02:11,760
we're all just managing more software

00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:13,590
than ever before agile is the best

00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,390
practice for managing software so

00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:19,680
just for that reason alone we should be

00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:21,660
adopting agile so I just Ideker say how

00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,069
many people in this room raise your hand

00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:26,250
if you're familiar with what what do I

00:02:23,069 --> 00:02:27,540
mean by agile do you all know okay so

00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:29,220
maybe half I'm gonna spend a little bit

00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:32,370
of time talking about what it is make

00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:34,170
trying to make it more tangible so the

00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:35,910
alternative to agile is waterfall right

00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:38,010
it's the classic measure twice cut once

00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:40,950
approach if you've got historical data

00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:42,299
you look at that data you analyze it you

00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:44,310
figure out what's gonna work in three

00:02:42,299 --> 00:02:46,860
months from now you do your serial

00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:49,110
project management and then three months

00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:52,010
later or six months later you deliver

00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:54,299
this thing and you hope that it works

00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:56,760
agile is a very different process it

00:02:54,299 --> 00:03:00,299
doesn't have a team's the team isn't

00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:01,980
working in serial mode it's working in

00:03:00,299 --> 00:03:03,900
parallel so you've got your designer you

00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:06,629
developer your test or so on working

00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:08,190
together on a teeny version or a Minimum

00:03:06,629 --> 00:03:10,290
Viable Product of what you're trying to

00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:12,480
build a site a landing page would what

00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:15,000
have you and they put that little thing

00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,650
in the market they get feedback they

00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,510
figure out what works get feedback on

00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:20,940
what works or what doesn't and they

00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:22,889
pivot and they iterate towards the thing

00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:24,870
that actually solves the problem or get

00:03:22,889 --> 00:03:26,880
two results for you that's the agile

00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:31,650
process in a nutshell and it really is

00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:33,480
the shortest path to what works so let

00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:35,790
me break down or help give you a little

00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:37,500
bit of structure the way that we share

00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:39,569
the way that I think about agile and

00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:41,670
what I found resonates with marketers is

00:03:39,569 --> 00:03:44,880
that I describe agile as being a

00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:47,370
philosophy or an approach and it's one

00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:49,440
that's optimized for this world in which

00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:51,329
we don't know what's gonna work in six

00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,950
months from now we can't confidently say

00:03:51,329 --> 00:03:55,590
if I do this I'm gonna get the outcome

00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:57,450
that I want and it deals with that by

00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:59,160
taking an iterative approach to

00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:00,780
validated learning so do something small

00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:02,760
see if we get positive feedback that

00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:06,060
works do more of it if it doesn't pivot

00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:09,329
and try something else that philosophy

00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:11,220
is then made actionable through some

00:04:09,329 --> 00:04:13,260
rigorous well-defined methods you've

00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:17,970
probably heard of the two most popular

00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:21,049
ones Kanban and scrum and those methods

00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:23,550
are really just a bundle of underlying

00:04:21,049 --> 00:04:25,860
practices that your team would do on a

00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:27,180
day to day basis and there's a portfolio

00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:29,610
Pro like 100 agile

00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:31,440
practices that you could embrace I'm

00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:32,910
gonna share just a couple of them to

00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:35,039
give you a sense of what these are so

00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:37,460
the first is just maintaining a backlog

00:04:35,039 --> 00:04:41,300
a list of the things you want to do

00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:44,130
prioritized scoped what we call groomed

00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:46,050
working in iterations meaning that

00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:47,940
you've released changes at a regular

00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:49,979
cadence that could be every two weeks it

00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:53,460
could be every week it could be a once a

00:04:49,979 --> 00:04:56,699
month and building releases and working

00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:58,110
in in blocks time box blocks having

00:04:56,699 --> 00:05:00,000
things like scrum meetings daily

00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:01,979
stand-ups synchronization meetings quick

00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,150
15-minute meetings to keep everybody on

00:05:01,979 --> 00:05:05,870
the same page you could do this every

00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:08,789
day or maybe a couple times a week

00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:11,520
things like a demo meeting at the demo

00:05:08,789 --> 00:05:14,580
you're showing off the work that you

00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:16,710
produced at the end of each iteration so

00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:18,330
every two weeks you're sending or you're

00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:19,650
sharing with your broader team here's

00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:21,330
the stuff that we launched is that we

00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:24,180
worked on so they're aware of it and

00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:26,729
then there's the retrospective which is

00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:29,070
this is that the quintessential the most

00:05:26,729 --> 00:05:31,110
important agile practice this doesn't

00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:32,940
look back at what you just produced

00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:35,220
that's what the demo meeting does it

00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:37,639
looks at how are the practices we're

00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:41,370
using how is the method we're using

00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:44,190
serving our team or company culture

00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:45,690
project so that's just a handful of

00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:49,320
practice so what does this look like in

00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:52,110
the context of a web team so you've got

00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:53,909
an initiative it could be something like

00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:56,580
you know improving the conversion of a

00:05:53,909 --> 00:05:58,800
landing page and you build out a backlog

00:05:56,580 --> 00:06:01,590
of things that you think that you could

00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:03,150
do that would impact that you take the

00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:06,000
first item out of the backlog you have

00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:07,800
that cross-functional team do an MVP or

00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,120
a mini version of that thing and you

00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:11,880
deploy it you see if it makes a

00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:14,099
difference if it does maybe you do more

00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:16,169
do another iteration if it optimizes

00:06:14,099 --> 00:06:18,180
your process or the experience on the

00:06:16,169 --> 00:06:20,699
page enough you can take the next item

00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:22,610
from the backlog and move on okay so

00:06:20,699 --> 00:06:27,000
that's fundamentally what it looks like

00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:29,460
agile is not new agile comes from a long

00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,940
tradition it's been we've been working

00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:35,310
on this for over 40 years some very

00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:37,349
smart developers who were working in the

00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:38,460
early days of the internet which was an

00:06:37,349 --> 00:06:40,620
environment in which things were

00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:43,020
changing very very quickly

00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:47,430
started developing the methods like

00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:50,130
scrum and ultimately in the early 2000s

00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:51,150
they got together a set of developers

00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:54,949
got together and wrote something called

00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:59,010
the agile manifesto this basically

00:06:54,949 --> 00:07:01,650
bundled up or put a wrapper a bow around

00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:03,479
some values and principles that these

00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:05,250
developers had been figuring out over

00:07:03,479 --> 00:07:08,940
the previous 17 years and by putting a

00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:11,070
name on it by calling it agile and the

00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:14,130
writing the agile manifesto they gave

00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:16,650
the community a thing to talk about and

00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:18,449
a thing to build community around and so

00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:20,190
there was practice sharing and that

00:07:18,449 --> 00:07:23,990
really drove the adoption of this these

00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:26,850
practices fast-forward another 11 years

00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:29,010
marketers world taken over by software

00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:31,430
we're facing a lot of similar challenges

00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:34,470
some smart marketers got together and

00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:37,260
interpreted that document and wrote the

00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:40,220
agile marketing manifesto fast forward

00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:43,199
to just last year and the first

00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:45,450
certification for agile marketing was

00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,620
launched by I see agile and there's a

00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:50,340
bunch of providers out there they can

00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:54,270
certify you there's really an ecosystem

00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:56,550
that has developed around to help us as

00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:58,680
marketers make our way through this

00:07:56,550 --> 00:08:00,450
agile transformation so the biggest

00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:01,979
consultant season in the world have

00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:03,750
built out digital transformation

00:08:01,979 --> 00:08:06,120
practices that include agile

00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:08,820
transformation practices they're writing

00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:11,010
a lot about this topic they've done more

00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:13,860
than a billion dollars of acquisitions

00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:16,380
of agencies so they can not only consult

00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:17,610
and do the executive buy-in and mindset

00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:21,500
changes but they can actually help you

00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:24,030
execute and deliver agile transformation

00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:26,220
there's a lot of training in the market

00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:28,470
that used to be only training for

00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:30,570
software engineers or product managers

00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:33,419
those companies are now pivoting and

00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:35,880
building training for business users

00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:37,380
like us marketers and I mentioned that

00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:39,570
there's a certification that was

00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:42,450
recently brought into market for

00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:46,020
marketers and then there's like a whole

00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:48,570
giant ecosystem of tools that are there

00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:51,000
to help us structure the way that we do

00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:52,620
agile I would break that down into two

00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,370
categories of tools there's general

00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:57,910
purpose tools like the

00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:59,590
or the asanas trelles lien kits of the

00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:01,000
world which are general project

00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:03,520
management tools and then there's

00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,140
specific purpose-built tools for

00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:07,600
specific kinds of teams that are doing

00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:10,690
specific kinds of jobs that's kind of

00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:12,760
where Pantheon fits in we are a tool

00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:13,960
just for web teams but there's other

00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:16,360
tools if you're in digital advertising

00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:18,520
that will help you do this kind of work

00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:20,290
or another tool for example like

00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:23,230
Optimizely is a tool that is obviously

00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:24,280
specifically for web teams that are

00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:27,880
trying to operate in a more agile

00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:30,520
fashion there's lots of agile content

00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:31,990
coming to conferences I'm here speaking

00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:34,060
to you at this one but if you go to

00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:35,770
other conferences you'll find tracks and

00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:38,140
sessions and lots of content is being

00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:40,600
authored I wrote a book one of your

00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:42,250
speakers in this event earlier today

00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:44,260
Scott Brinker wrote a book there was a

00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:45,370
lot about applying agile practices in

00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:50,170
the marketing world called hacking

00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:52,840
marketing this has been a trend in

00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:54,610
marketing for quite a while I'm showing

00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:59,260
some Google Trends data here

00:09:54,610 --> 00:10:01,600
that looks at the search term volume

00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:05,020
search term of agile marketing and I'm

00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:06,580
also showing lean marketing because the

00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:08,620
lean tradition the agile tradition if

00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:10,450
you had the Venn diagram of those two

00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:13,030
things there's about 80 percent overlap

00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:14,410
so when we look at the way that

00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:16,270
marketers are adopting this we need to

00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:17,800
actually look at those in composite

00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:19,900
together because there's basically a

00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:24,130
shared set of values and principles

00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:26,080
underneath it the way that agile has

00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:27,760
made its way into the marketing function

00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:29,260
it's been marching through different

00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:32,110
functions really it started with digital

00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:35,290
advertising we didn't call it agile back

00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:36,880
then but essentially you don't

00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:38,230
purpose-built tools that helped us

00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:40,420
optimize ad spend

00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:43,180
right do multivariant testing those

00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:46,330
kinds of things are very much within the

00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:48,070
agile mindset or an agile framework we

00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:49,840
then extend it to content marketing

00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:52,180
that's the stuff that we were promoting

00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:54,100
let's iterate on existing content rather

00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:56,110
than always creating new content build

00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:59,620
an SEO engine the drive serves our

00:10:56,110 --> 00:11:01,840
business social marketing put a j'l to

00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:04,750
use in helping us be much more reactive

00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:06,280
and responsive in a really timely manner

00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:08,380
and put a lot of pressure on that and

00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:10,060
now it's really coming to the digital

00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:14,590
experience world it's coming to the the

00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:17,620
sites that we deploy so if you look at

00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:20,020
the enterprise the last thing that I

00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:21,070
want to mention though there is that so

00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:23,950
even though it's marched across

00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:27,430
marketing it's quite siloed and you can

00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:29,040
see that as we look at the way that it's

00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:31,900
playing itself out in the enterprise so

00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:34,570
80% of companies fall into a situation

00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:37,300
where mid-level managers have seen the

00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:39,310
value of agile and they do it within

00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:41,020
their function and they're trying to you

00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:43,030
know drive broader agile transformation

00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:45,490
but they don't succeed very often less

00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:47,500
than a quarter of the time other end of

00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:49,450
the extreme you've got a situation where

00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:51,430
you've got a forward-thinking CMO who's

00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:53,320
bought into agile maybe they were one of

00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:54,700
those mid-level managers previously and

00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:56,830
they're willing to invest in the

00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:58,480
consulting and the training to transform

00:11:56,830 --> 00:12:00,250
their organization and you get better

00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:03,550
results but not that much better than a

00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:05,020
coin toss best results come from a

00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:06,850
situation where you've got both you've

00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:08,350
got mid-level managers driving it up and

00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:09,850
you've got an executive who's bought in

00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:12,400
and can make it happen

00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:13,720
okay the thing is it's hard to get

00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:15,610
through this broader agile

00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:18,130
transformation thing that's why things

00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:20,910
are quite siloed so there are two

00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:23,500
weapons that we have to combat this the

00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:25,720
first I think is pretty well known which

00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:28,030
is the executive education bed if you

00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:30,400
don't have executive buy-in you're gonna

00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:32,380
have a really hard time it's it's the

00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:34,240
single biggest impediment in my view to

00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:37,030
driving broader agile transformation and

00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,200
this is why the big four consulting

00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:40,420
companies are out there building

00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:43,090
practices to help change this do

00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:44,650
executive education but there's also a

00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:46,150
secret weapon and that's what I want to

00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:48,880
talk about with the rest of my time

00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:50,680
today so that's the web team your web

00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:52,240
teams can be really helpful when it

00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:54,850
comes to driving broader adoption the

00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:57,880
reason is pretty simple it's that

00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:59,980
everything we do as marketers plays

00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:02,290
itself out through the website whether

00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:03,880
you're doing you know you could do

00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:06,250
retail you're still driving people back

00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:08,890
to traditional retail drives people back

00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:10,600
to the web you know if whatever you're

00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:12,460
doing in app drive people back to the

00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:15,730
web email driving people back to the web

00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:19,450
you know chat Direct Mail it's all

00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:21,160
coming back to your site so any any

00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:24,010
function within the broader marketing

00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:26,040
group needs to interact with this team

00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:29,320
to get things done so this team can

00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:31,210
expose them to an agile process and get

00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:33,160
them to work within that process and

00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:37,360
have a kind of transformative effect

00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:41,020
across the broader group this is where

00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:43,480
I'm gonna get in to defining web ops and

00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:45,220
the role that Web Apps has to play so

00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:46,720
Web Apps is really a combination of

00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:49,120
words it's the web team and the

00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:52,090
operations team or the marketers us and

00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:53,980
our developers who deliver a website Web

00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:55,900
Apps is all about streamlining the

00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:58,800
process of delivering changes to our

00:13:55,900 --> 00:14:02,650
site allowing us to move more quickly

00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:05,950
and you know we we know that when teams

00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:07,660
embrace Web Apps it's it's a enabler for

00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:09,790
agility and we know that agility

00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:11,050
increases the likelihood of success of

00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:15,670
the projects that we're running because

00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:17,110
it D risks them the term web ops may

00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:18,730
sound a little bit familiar to you if

00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:21,520
you haven't heard it before because it

00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:23,140
sounds a lot like DevOps right DevOps is

00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:25,450
something I'm guessing most of you are

00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:27,370
familiar with actually let me just ask

00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:29,110
quickly how many of you had heard the

00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:30,430
term web ops do you know what that in

00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:32,910
advance do you know what this means okay

00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:34,600
so like maybe thirty percent of the room

00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:39,730
that's great

00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:41,140
so DevOps is you developer operations a

00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:43,210
combination of those two things but

00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:45,730
basically it's a combination of tools

00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:47,520
and processes that help software

00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:50,080
development teams move more quickly and

00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:50,830
DevOps your DevOps implementation if

00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:53,380
you're building an enterprise

00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:55,060
application it's a set of tools and a

00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:56,740
set of processes if you're building a

00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:59,500
mobile app it's a slightly different set

00:14:56,740 --> 00:15:02,620
of tools and processes so what web Ops

00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:04,150
is is it's an optimized version of tools

00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:06,760
and processes that are just for web

00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:08,380
teams so that's it's very related to

00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:12,190
DevOps but it's specifically built for

00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:15,550
web teams so if you think about what is

00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:17,260
a web what's the structure of web ops I

00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:21,180
think of it as it being a three-tiered

00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:23,500
structure at the bottom layer there's

00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:26,170
basically the platform that just powers

00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:29,980
your site in in our case the Pantheon's

00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:32,620
case that's a that's a server with CMS

00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:35,260
the next layer up is an automation layer

00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:37,180
where we just automate a lot of the

00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:38,950
things that your developers would

00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:41,560
otherwise have to do and spend time on

00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:43,390
that could be upgrading your CMS when a

00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:45,250
new version comes out and spinning up

00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:47,830
and develop a development environment so

00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:49,480
you can see it it could be taking your

00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:52,090
production data and pushing it back into

00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:54,460
your test and stage environments it

00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:55,870
could be you know upgrading plugins it

00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:58,150
could be innumerable things you can

00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:59,200
automate a bunch of testing and then at

00:15:58,150 --> 00:16:01,240
the top layer

00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:03,790
there's agile workflows which just is

00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:05,680
another way of saying let's structure

00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:07,870
the way that work is done make sure that

00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:09,550
handoffs are consistent prevent things

00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:11,860
from being dropped in your process

00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:13,450
prevent things from releasing that

00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:17,340
shouldn't be releasing etc so that's

00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:17,340
basically what web Ops is in a nutshell

00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:21,940
higher-ed is an interesting that's a

00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:24,400
case study they want to share with you

00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:26,350
from Cornell University they are an

00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:29,410
interesting music's in fact any higher

00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:30,880
edie organization is an interesting use

00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:33,370
case because they tend to be very very

00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,720
complex so this is a Drupal environment

00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:36,280
where they've got hundreds of sites

00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,590
they've got hundreds like many different

00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:41,020
stakeholders everything from recruiting

00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:44,770
to the main site for the University two

00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:48,280
sites for professors you name it

00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:52,390
so governance is a really challenging

00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:54,550
issue here when Cornell brought in web

00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:55,840
ops and they brought in this platform

00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:58,090
they were able to operate in a more

00:16:55,840 --> 00:17:00,730
agile fashion but there was an

00:16:58,090 --> 00:17:03,340
unexpected benefit that they saw which

00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:04,720
is that because all these different

00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:07,480
teams from across the company had to

00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:10,959
interact with that central team in a

00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:12,670
consistent way it actually caused them

00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:15,880
to align on a number of other things

00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:18,100
that had not really directly anything to

00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:19,900
do with the web technology it let it

00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:21,010
they started getting on the same page

00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:23,170
when it comes to the way they

00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:25,600
represented themselves the way that they

00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:27,940
spoke about themselves there was a an

00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:32,290
unintended consequence you could say of

00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:34,060
having this way of working be consistent

00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:37,800
across the organization and this is this

00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:40,300
gives us a hint or a cue as to why

00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:42,070
deploying web ops can actually help

00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:44,520
drive agility across the broader

00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:44,520
marketing

00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:50,429
so let's go back again how does this

00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:53,290
what does this mean for your web team

00:17:50,429 --> 00:17:55,570
what does it look like so one of the

00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:57,250
things that it means is that you're

00:17:55,570 --> 00:18:00,210
going to transition from a world in

00:17:57,250 --> 00:18:04,030
which you're doing a small number of

00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:07,360
very big releases in a quarter let's say

00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:09,429
to a world in which you're doing a very

00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:11,740
very large number of really small

00:18:09,429 --> 00:18:14,640
releases that's good because big

00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:17,559
releases are high-risk if they go wrong

00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:20,290
that is not good no marketer wants to be

00:18:17,559 --> 00:18:23,470
in that world when we have lots of small

00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:25,630
releases it's not just that we D risk

00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:27,549
but we we actually put points on the

00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:30,450
board faster because we're starting to

00:18:27,549 --> 00:18:36,340
deliver value earlier in the process

00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:39,010
okay so how did well how does this

00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:40,990
actually look if you're working on a

00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:42,880
particular project let's go back to that

00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:46,480
webpage example where I'm trying to get

00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:48,190
it to convert better there's two metrics

00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:51,520
that are helpful to understand or to

00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:54,100
frame up the way that a an agile web

00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:55,990
team would work so there's this concept

00:18:54,100 --> 00:19:00,040
of the North Star that could be like

00:18:55,990 --> 00:19:02,650
what is my overall site conversion then

00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:03,940
you can have a gear lever a gear level

00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:06,100
or something that's really really

00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:08,230
focused on a metric that you can

00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:10,030
actually see move so if you make for

00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:12,250
example a change on a very specific and

00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:15,640
important landing page and you do a

00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:18,190
great job and you change the conversion

00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:21,130
of that page it's probably not gonna

00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:24,250
like massively move your Northstar

00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:27,309
metric so you won't be able to see

00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:30,100
statistical significance in that context

00:19:27,309 --> 00:19:31,960
so what at what this approach will

00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:34,059
allows you to do is to focus on these

00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:36,910
gear levers the place where you can make

00:19:34,059 --> 00:19:38,200
small changes that are measurable and

00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:40,030
where you can see statistical

00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:42,760
significance but where you also know

00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:44,380
you're moving that big gear right it's

00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:46,600
like looking at a clock right you're not

00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:48,790
able to see that our hand move you need

00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:50,950
to look at the second hand to be able to

00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:54,570
see the impact that these many many

00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:54,570
small changes are making for you

00:19:54,640 --> 00:20:01,850
baked into this is this idea that if

00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:04,940
you're gonna work in this new way and

00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:06,860
you're gonna embrace agile you have to

00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:10,340
be able to make a lot of small changes

00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:13,640
so if the cost of making anyone change

00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:17,360
is high you effectively can't embrace

00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:19,250
this approach you need your platform you

00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:21,350
need the cost of deploying changes to be

00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:23,270
very very well this is why web ops is

00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:26,030
important because it brings process and

00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:27,950
automation that drives down the cost of

00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:30,260
making any individual change on your

00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:35,420
site so it's really an enabler of

00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:38,510
agility in that way ok so if we think

00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:42,380
about the value that web Ops has to

00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:45,230
offer your team there's really two parts

00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:49,070
of the value the first part is pretty

00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:50,720
linear that's the blue line so if you

00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:52,700
have web ops and you didn't have

00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:55,550
automation for something like deploying

00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:57,980
a change to your site where your

00:20:55,550 --> 00:21:00,710
developer might have had to spend you

00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:03,530
know four hours to get something from

00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:04,790
your staging environment to your live

00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:06,770
environment just because there were a

00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:09,290
bunch of manual processes that he had to

00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:11,630
do automation can bring that down to

00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:13,280
maybe four minutes so every time you

00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:14,990
make a release you get that benefit

00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:19,040
that's a linear benefit and it's very

00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:22,550
straightforward the agile benefit is not

00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:25,550
linear though because what we've seen

00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:30,190
with our customers is that when web

00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:32,840
teams get in the cadence of operating

00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:36,800
but deploying changes very very quickly

00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:40,309
really small changes what occasionally

00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:42,020
happens is that they make a change they

00:21:40,309 --> 00:21:44,390
wouldn't have known this in advance but

00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:47,510
that small change actually leads to a

00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:50,059
really big change in conversion and that

00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:51,770
drives an inflection point in the value

00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:54,590
that these changes are making and

00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:57,350
deriving for your company so this is

00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:59,870
really kind of where the the

00:21:57,350 --> 00:22:02,570
aspirational value of embracing agility

00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:03,800
comes from it's a recognition of this

00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:06,320
fact that we don't know what's going to

00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:07,250
work and we're going to do lots and lots

00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:10,460
of small change

00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:13,250
is that our gonna you know consistent we

00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:14,300
derive value for us but once in a while

00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:15,620
we're gonna stumble on one of these

00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:17,540
changes which is going to have really

00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:20,600
something that's transformative in in

00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:22,100
the way that it impacts our business so

00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:23,660
I'm gonna stop there hopefully that

00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:27,020
gives you a kind of a really good sense

00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:29,450
of what Web Apps is and how it can help

00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:32,090
your team operate in a more agile

00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:33,800
fashion I think we may have like one or

00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:39,490
two extra minutes here so I'm happy to

00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:39,490
take questions if you have them shoot

00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:43,030
yeah

00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:50,300
Thanks so I am I am my team I'm a

00:22:48,170 --> 00:22:54,500
one-person marketing design and

00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:57,830
development department departments and

00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:59,870
right now so I've just been like given

00:22:57,830 --> 00:23:02,810
this marketing hat and I'm getting way

00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:05,210
off into CRO conversion rate

00:23:02,810 --> 00:23:07,760
optimization yeah not sure what a bunch

00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:11,150
of user tests and stuff so would I take

00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:13,940
away from this that I am far better

00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:15,590
served so first thing I'm tackling is

00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:19,520
our homepage because it gets the most

00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:21,710
traffic by your landing page by um just

00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:24,350
change in one little thing at a time a

00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:27,590
be testing it see how it goes as opposed

00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:29,150
to let's redesign the homepage put it

00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:30,980
out there yeah so I think the process

00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:34,670
really starts with what is your business

00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:37,160
initiative then let's build that backlog

00:23:34,670 --> 00:23:39,440
here's all the ideas that we have that

00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:43,370
we think are gonna serve as an

00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:46,400
intervention then grooming the backlog

00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:50,000
let's scope those things and prioritize

00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:52,730
them and then yes do the smallest

00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,800
possible thing you can do to validate if

00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:58,190
you're heading in the right direction so

00:23:54,800 --> 00:24:01,250
that's basically the process you know

00:23:58,190 --> 00:24:05,330
there are some cases where there needs

00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:07,520
to be like a wholesale redesign of the

00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:10,340
thing and in those cases what you might

00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:12,110
do is actually start working on an MVP

00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:14,780
that you're only gonna surface to a

00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:17,630
fraction of your overall traffic right

00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:19,880
and it's gonna be very basic but you're

00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:20,790
working in parallel while your primary

00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:22,200
site is

00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:23,880
they're your primary homepage is like

00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:25,290
kind of static you're ignoring it for a

00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:26,790
while while you develop this other thing

00:24:25,290 --> 00:24:28,710
and show it to some customers and you

00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:29,850
evolve that and it becomes more robust

00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:31,590
and there's a point in which you just

00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:33,950
shut off the old thing right okay cool

00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:41,190
thank you yep

00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:42,960
other questions yes I did write a book

00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:45,330
on this topic it's called the agile

00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:48,210
marketer how to turn customer experience

00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:50,010
into your competitive advantage and the

00:24:48,210 --> 00:24:53,370
podcasts that I co-host is called the

00:24:50,010 --> 00:24:56,310
marketing agility podcast we are always

00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:59,040
looking for folks to share their

00:24:56,310 --> 00:25:01,680
experiences with agile good bad or ugly

00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:03,600
so if you try agile and put it to use

00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:07,620
I'd love to hear from you feel free to

00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:10,200
reach out thanks for the talk yes

00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:14,460
so without realizing it we already do

00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:17,820
web Ops we just call sure if you can

00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:19,770
give a practical example let's say we're

00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:22,520
working with a company and they're

00:25:19,770 --> 00:25:28,410
looking to do lots of campaigns

00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:31,500
rapid-fire so how would our agile

00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:33,930
marketing web ops gonna play out in that

00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:36,360
kind of scenario and why would be why

00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:38,910
would it get faster than maybe what we

00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:42,510
did before yes so the first thing I

00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:44,580
would say is like web ops is something

00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:48,810
you can absolutely build on your own and

00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:52,230
lots of teams do do this the the reason

00:25:48,810 --> 00:25:54,360
to work with a platform like Pantheon or

00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:57,810
any managed service that provides web

00:25:54,360 --> 00:26:01,020
apps or DevOps is that there's a bunch

00:25:57,810 --> 00:26:04,260
of time that you are spending on setting

00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:06,030
up the integration of DevOps tools those

00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:09,930
integrations and somebody has to manage

00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:11,490
that so tools like Pantheon or platforms

00:26:09,930 --> 00:26:14,130
like Pantheon just they make that a

00:26:11,490 --> 00:26:15,620
managed service so that your whether

00:26:14,130 --> 00:26:18,480
it's you or somebody else on your team

00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:20,520
isn't spending time on managing the web

00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:22,740
ops implementation and thereby gets to

00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:25,620
spend more time developing code and

00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:28,620
innovating and delivering hopefully

00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:29,760
higher level value then what we can

00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:31,980
provide with the platform so that's

00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:33,690
that's one thing just have your

00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:35,160
resources focus on action

00:26:33,690 --> 00:26:39,200
delivering the campaigns and not on

00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:42,390
maintaining a web apps implementation I

00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:43,920
think fundamentally it's this your

00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:45,840
question goes back to the two primary

00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:47,930
values that I mentioned at the end which

00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:51,540
is that we're just we're just gonna

00:26:47,930 --> 00:26:53,790
allow you to move faster by automating a

00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:55,410
lot of the work that you have to do so

00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:56,820
you spend time less time on that and

00:26:55,410 --> 00:26:58,950
spend more time on the things that you

00:26:56,820 --> 00:27:01,290
really care about I think there's other

00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:03,090
tools within I'll just speak about the

00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:06,030
Pantheon portfolio for a minute there's

00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:11,100
other tools that we have to make it easy

00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:14,910
to apply templates or components at a

00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:18,210
massive scale so you can take shared

00:27:14,910 --> 00:27:21,540
components or atomized bits and deploy

00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:25,170
them in into Lots environments very very

00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:27,060
quickly in our architectural approach to

00:27:25,170 --> 00:27:29,400
doing this is is better than the

00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:32,670
approach that is just built into the CMS

00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:34,050
whether it's true forward for us so the

00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:36,590
tooling that we provide there is really

00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:41,130
really valuable when it comes to scaling

00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:47,010
but the components or the atomized bits

00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:50,460
of code that you've developed yeah we

00:27:47,010 --> 00:27:55,959
have time yes okay thank you very much

00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:55,959
[Applause]

00:27:57,380 --> 00:28:04,790
okay so we're you have two sessions

00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:07,650
coming up we'll be in here and

00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:11,880
presenting content creation secrets for

00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:14,850
rock stars and then Rick is Rick here he

00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:15,780
hasn't touched base yet so do you want

00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:17,610
to head up

00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:21,780
dori dori is gonna head up and make sure

00:28:17,610 --> 00:28:26,690
he's here last call for Rick Rick here

00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:26,690
