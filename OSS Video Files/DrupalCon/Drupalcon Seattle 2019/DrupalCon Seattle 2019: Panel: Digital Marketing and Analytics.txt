Thank You ver BC so jumping straight in

00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:05,670
I looked at the registration list for

00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:08,640
this session and we have quite a diverse

00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:10,409
range of skills in the room we have

00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,479

contact managers communications people

00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:18,360
web managers and so on well my guess is

00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:20,369
most of you are involved in building and

00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:23,130
managing websites of various scales and

00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:25,799
and creating the content for that and so

00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:27,030
you know some of the challenges you're

00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:29,869
going to have marrying design and

00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:34,049
creativity in order to make that website

00:01:29,869 --> 00:01:35,640
good and make users love to visit all

00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:37,079
the while making sure it's done in a

00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:40,860
quick and efficient way am I right about

00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:46,350
that everybody's on that page good stuff

00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:47,670
so we make sure you're all to make it a

00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:49,680
bit easier so what we're going to do up

00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:51,299
here is discuss a bit more about how

00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,540
we're going to we might do this and

00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:55,979
hopefully give you some tips and ideas

00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:57,840
for when you're actually tackling that

00:01:55,979 --> 00:02:00,329
same kind those same kind of issues and

00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,969
challenges so I'll start with a question

00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:05,219
or two but if you have questions of your

00:02:02,969 --> 00:02:07,829
own please don't hesitate to come up to

00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:10,500
the speak the microphone at the start

00:02:07,829 --> 00:02:11,100
either during our discussion or we're

00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,650
going to leave

00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:17,160
minutes at the end as well so I'm gonna

00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:20,130
start out with some questions and just

00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:22,820
to lead it off so because I'm gonna be

00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:25,770
like the the client of talking to the

00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:28,920
experts here so that's my approach on it

00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:31,530
anyway so my first question to the guys

00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:33,660
here is where do you start when you're

00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:37,320
when you're going to start a new website

00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:39,180
or a new section of a website what are

00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:40,530
the first things that you were going to

00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:43,440
want to know so that you make that

00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:50,580
project a success anybody like to jump

00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:52,080
in there sharing a mic here the first

00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:54,870
thing that I always love doing and I'm

00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,040
kind of notorious for doing this I don't

00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:59,280
know if notorious is the right word but

00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:01,620
I always ask a lot of why questions or

00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:05,130
questions to get at the why how how is

00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:08,220
what we're about to try to accomplish

00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:10,530
gonna impact the organizational goals at

00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:12,900
the highest level and then I try to work

00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:14,190
down to the weeds so what are the

00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:15,360
organization goals that we're trying to

00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:18,870
do how does this line up with the

00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:20,250
overall organization strategy and then

00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:22,740
making sure that you know we have the

00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:25,110
context around the challenge so if

00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:29,820
anybody comes in myself included with

00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:31,530
kind of a preconceived idea of like this

00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:33,090
should be the solution we kind of all

00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:35,640
get to check ourselves and say how does

00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:38,010
this align with the overall strategy to

00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:40,080
make sure that we're not just coming in

00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:42,090
with an idea for a solution but we're

00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:45,180
really starting at the ground ground

00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:47,670
level one of the acronyms that I like to

00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:49,260
think about it's called rope it's a way

00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:50,640
to think through different questions so

00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:51,810
first I want to talk about results I

00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,370
want to talk about what are we trying to

00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:55,440
accomplish I want to talk about

00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:57,990
opportunities of what what's available

00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:59,580
for us to do the problems and then the

00:03:57,990 --> 00:04:02,010
execution how are we actually gonna

00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:03,900
going to do that so that's kind of a

00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:06,930
framework that I initially start with

00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:14,100
and then getting more into the weeds

00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:16,859
after that yeah so totally agree totally

00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:19,410
agree so yeah definitely understanding

00:04:16,859 --> 00:04:20,930
it the high level what you know what's

00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:23,340
the rationale for this project why now

00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:25,669
you know what

00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:28,860
look like how can we actually measure

00:04:25,669 --> 00:04:30,030
whether the effort that's being spent

00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:31,919
and the time speak spend the money is

00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:33,000
being spent on this project how we can

00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:35,070
actually understand whether there's been

00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,830
value that's been achieved is definitely

00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:38,870
critical the other one I think that you

00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:41,190
know we tried to do as much as possible

00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:43,400
it's to try to you know organizer

00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:45,600
projects as much as possible around

00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:47,699
actual feedback from from the users

00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,710
getting getting the actual customer at

00:04:47,699 --> 00:04:52,229
the end users into the process as much

00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:53,699
as possible and you know that's

00:04:52,229 --> 00:04:55,979
something that a lot of projects say and

00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:57,750
and you know try to achieve but some of

00:04:55,979 --> 00:04:59,340
things we've seen have a lot of value

00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:00,960
it's really planning early for things

00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:02,430
like even getting the users into let's

00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,290
say the discovery process like the

00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:06,210
on-site workshops even inviting them

00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:08,580
some of them to help kind of co-create

00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:10,560
some of the journey Maps or the personas

00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:14,130
those can be really powerful ways to get

00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,240
to get early buy-in to start to lower

00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:18,270
the anxiety of people and didn't make

00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:19,650
sure that people feel that ok the the

00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:21,840
way that we're approaching this project

00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:24,630
and the way that we're conceiving of

00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:26,280
these features and solutions are already

00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:27,660
already being sort of we're hearing from

00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:30,300
the users directly that these are things

00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:32,510
that they respond well to and things

00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:34,770
that they want so obviously because

00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:37,169
getting users involved in projects takes

00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:38,930
early planning usually on day one you're

00:05:37,169 --> 00:05:41,070
already behind on that kind of planning

00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:43,410
you know just having having a really

00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:44,940
good work back understanding day-to-day

00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:47,340
and week-to-week how you going to go

00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:49,169
about making sure that the business is

00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:50,160
being heard and that they have the

00:05:49,169 --> 00:05:51,870
business goals are in front of you all

00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,280
the time and that you're you know

00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:55,650
successfully kind of bringing in about

00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:57,539
some sort of validation regularly not

00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:58,889
just one round of user testing but

00:05:57,539 --> 00:06:00,330
regularly bring in validation to make

00:05:58,889 --> 00:06:02,280
sure that the things of the business

00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:05,760
want are also desired by users and you

00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:07,500
have a good sort of Venn diagram where

00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:09,419
the goals that you've set up like what

00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:11,669
we talked about are actually also

00:06:09,419 --> 00:06:12,930
running through the filter of whether

00:06:11,669 --> 00:06:15,500
this is actually something that is going

00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:15,500
to add value

00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:20,180
it's very important that to understand

00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:21,500
what your users goals are when they

00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:23,120
arrive at the website what are they

00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:25,160
there for where they look what do they

00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,930
want to achieve when you understand that

00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:30,130
it'll give you a greater clarity of what

00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:32,000
your mission is you begin the project

00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:35,840
thank you

00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:39,230
now the word personas was brought up

00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:41,330
just then and I'm sure everybody has a

00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:44,030
good understanding of personas can I see

00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:45,890
a raise advance everybody okay because

00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:49,460
we had a bit of a discussion before this

00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:51,440
session about the use of personas and I

00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:53,510
actually brought up the point that

00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:56,470
there's a guy called Jason fried who is

00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:58,940
all from here Friday yes who started the

00:06:56,470 --> 00:07:02,090
the project management tool base camp

00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:03,860
and he said personas lead to a false

00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:07,700
sense of understanding at the deepest

00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:10,640
most critical levels so I just wanted to

00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:13,550
and personally when I was first

00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:17,180
presented with some personas in fact by

00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:19,850
Bjorn I was a little hesitant as to the

00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:21,830
validity and they usability so I just

00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:24,380
wanted to find out from the guys what

00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:25,700
their take was on personas how how much

00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:27,560
you can use them how much you rely on

00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:30,410
them and how they feel with the overall

00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:34,610
project structure it's always Jeff throw

00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:37,940
and curveball - yeah so you can start on

00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:41,030
that one is is you know I think personas

00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:42,860
can have a lot of value to help the

00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:45,470
organization that he's using them and

00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:47,270
the project team in general just have

00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:50,060
sort of easy and friendly ways of

00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:51,200
talking about the users and what the

00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:53,150
users are achieve their pain points that

00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:55,460
running into but like any tool they have

00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:57,470
limits I think if you treat them as the

00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:59,030
gospel and treat them as the thing that

00:07:57,470 --> 00:08:02,600
you always come back to every time and

00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:05,450
aren't a aren't supplementing them with

00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:07,669
actual data so you know it is a very

00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:09,290
common situation where a persona will be

00:08:07,669 --> 00:08:11,840
written in a committee often in an on

00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:13,250
site on day one or day two you kind of

00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:16,190
sketch them out on the board you know

00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:19,460
using the sort of lean UX approach which

00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:21,590
is has piles of value to get ideas out

00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:24,440
and start start to get the the project

00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:25,309
moving forward but if they stop there

00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,869
then in some ways

00:08:25,309 --> 00:08:28,339
nothing to say that you failed but you

00:08:26,869 --> 00:08:29,719
probably aren't going as far as you

00:08:28,339 --> 00:08:30,979
could to really get buy-in and get a

00:08:29,719 --> 00:08:33,829
persona that's actually gonna add

00:08:30,979 --> 00:08:35,469
business value so I think Daniel we were

00:08:33,829 --> 00:08:38,569
talking earlier about this of just how

00:08:35,469 --> 00:08:41,029
the persona needs to be kind of a living

00:08:38,569 --> 00:08:42,110
breathing breathing thing that a isn't

00:08:41,029 --> 00:08:44,480
the only thing you're looking at you

00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:45,860
should also be doing how you know a good

00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,360
amount of original sort of user research

00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:50,029
competitive analysis and other other

00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:52,970
ways of gaining insight but that also

00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:54,769
the persona should be added to and the

00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:55,850
persona should be evolving as you learn

00:08:54,769 --> 00:08:57,079
more about your business as you're

00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:58,759
talking to your sales folks as you're

00:08:57,079 --> 00:09:02,809
talking to the users and understanding

00:08:58,759 --> 00:09:05,120
exactly you know exactly what users want

00:09:02,809 --> 00:09:06,050
from the site whether these personas are

00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,670
actually the right the right way to

00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:08,930
split it with other sub personas you

00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:11,420
might wanna look at all those kinds of

00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:13,579
things should shouldn't just stop in

00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:15,019
that initial on site I think you do the

00:09:13,579 --> 00:09:17,149
on-site then you get the sort of project

00:09:15,019 --> 00:09:18,709
brief that shows you a four personas it

00:09:17,149 --> 00:09:23,420
should always be so we're moving beyond

00:09:18,709 --> 00:09:26,629
that fairly limited effort in a previous

00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:29,300
role I led the marketing for an agency

00:09:26,629 --> 00:09:31,009
that I worked at and I'm a big advocate

00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:33,350
for personas I could probably talk about

00:09:31,009 --> 00:09:35,269
it for the rest of this time but save

00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:37,610
you guys from that catch me later if you

00:09:35,269 --> 00:09:40,100
want to do that but one of the things

00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:41,839
that I looked at is we had personas that

00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:43,970
were basically handed to me and said

00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:46,069
here are their personas and I started

00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:47,540
just like peppering my team with a bunch

00:09:46,069 --> 00:09:48,829
of questions so tell me how does this

00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:51,139
person think and how does this person

00:09:48,829 --> 00:09:52,879
think and the way I was approaching it

00:09:51,139 --> 00:09:54,410
is I want to know this person like

00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:56,660
they're my best friend right I want to

00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:58,490
know how they think I want to know I

00:09:56,660 --> 00:10:00,019
want to know how they would react in

00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:01,699
different situations what are the

00:10:00,019 --> 00:10:04,790
challenges that they're facing how can I

00:10:01,699 --> 00:10:09,410
help better whatever it is that they're

00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:11,420
they're looking for and in order to have

00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:12,889
a strong relationship with someone you

00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:14,120
need to keep asking questions you need

00:10:12,889 --> 00:10:15,889
to keep learning about them you're not

00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:17,750
just gonna say I've asked you five

00:10:15,889 --> 00:10:18,350
questions so now I know everything about

00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:21,500
you

00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:24,649
you keep asking questions so what my

00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:27,980
process was as I was kind of managing

00:10:24,649 --> 00:10:31,699
personas I would any time we had a new

00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:33,230
client come on board or a new even sales

00:10:31,699 --> 00:10:34,550
prospect I would go and talk to the

00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:36,259
sales team and you know get all the

00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:37,550
basic information what are they looking

00:10:36,259 --> 00:10:39,560
for

00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:41,000
they interested in but then I would

00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:42,709
start asking questions about their

00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,709
personality because I wanted to know

00:10:42,709 --> 00:10:47,420
them more and then I would you know

00:10:45,709 --> 00:10:50,899
consume all of that information and then

00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:53,209
start kind of categorizing it and and

00:10:50,899 --> 00:10:54,829
trying to figure out how do those fit

00:10:53,209 --> 00:10:58,339
into our overall idea of who our

00:10:54,829 --> 00:10:59,630
personas are but keeping in mind just to

00:10:58,339 --> 00:11:03,500
reiterate one of the things that Bjorn

00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:05,779
said was it is just a tool so shifting

00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:07,700
the the mentality of how you do personas

00:11:05,779 --> 00:11:10,459
to have something that works for your

00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:13,399
organization if you have you know a

00:11:10,459 --> 00:11:15,200
slide deck of six personas that were

00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:18,560
handed to you and you've never looked at

00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:20,410
it again that is obviously not a format

00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:23,000
that works for you so finding one

00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:24,980
finding a format or a process that works

00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,019
for you to gather and collect all that

00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:29,089
information that you can refer back to I

00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:30,560
think is one of the key points of making

00:11:29,089 --> 00:11:32,420
sure that you don't have that false

00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,649
sense of understanding because you're

00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:35,089
continually asking questions you're

00:11:33,649 --> 00:11:37,970
continually updating it and referring

00:11:35,089 --> 00:11:39,620
back to it for me that was a Google Doc

00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:41,180
and I would just update it regularly if

00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:43,100
it's a slide deck that's awesome if

00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:44,720
there's another tool that you use there

00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:47,060
are so many different tools out there

00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,500
but making sure that when you see it as

00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:52,640
a tool and there's you know there's room

00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:54,680
for room for weaknesses in it but also

00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:56,270
doing something that in a way that is

00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:59,899
gonna be valuable to you and how your

00:11:56,270 --> 00:12:01,100
organization works I really like that in

00:11:59,899 --> 00:12:02,660
general just so kind of as a living

00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:04,910
document somehow when you put something

00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:06,410
in a slide Jack you might look it on

00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:09,320
Monday and then look at it in Monday two

00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:13,270
years from now just the nature of static

00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:13,270
documents so I totally agree with that

00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,880
user personas are also very valuable

00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,230
when it comes to understanding what

00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:20,820
device types they're gonna be using to

00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:22,170
access your website you need to

00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:24,030
concentrate more on to mobile or a

00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:25,890
tablet because that user may be accesses

00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:28,020
it while they're out in the middle of a

00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:29,910
field somewhere or maybe they're at at a

00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:31,920
desktop computer because they're

00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:32,340
researching your site while they're at

00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:35,280
work

00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:36,480
so understanding the the device and also

00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:38,520
the marketing channels that are being

00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,200
used to target them and and maybe like

00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:42,210
as an email marketing campaign or is a

00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:43,680
social media what what are the best ways

00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:47,820
to reach those people

00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:50,690
oh yes I was just about to ask you any

00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:50,690
questions so done

00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:14,720
I appreciate the research to create

00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:48,860
that is a big challenge I hear you so

00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:51,290
are they coming at it from a perspective

00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:55,490
of here's the feature of Product X

00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:59,200
here's how a benefits user a is that

00:13:55,490 --> 00:13:59,200
kind of how they are formatted right now

00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:59,280
are they open to conversations like can

00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:00,930
you ask them questions about tell me

00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:02,910
more about how you came to this

00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:06,630
conclusion on this line about the

00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:08,790
persona would you be able to you know

00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:11,490
looking at the user path or if you have

00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:16,230
it connected with the Salesforce or a

00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:17,930
party so to say this person bought it or

00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:20,250
bought whatever product you're selling

00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:22,380
here's what they looked at can we have a

00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:23,580
conversation about help me understand

00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:24,960
maybe how this lines up with the

00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:26,700
personas here's what I'm seeing that

00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:28,260
they actually went through let's have a

00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:31,110
conversation about do we see any

00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:35,190
patterns or trends because it could be

00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:36,750
helpful the way I always tried to get

00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:40,740
buy-in is figuring out how is it going

00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:43,230
to benefit them yeah so if there's ways

00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:45,600
that you can say 40 percent of people

00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:48,320
before they buy product X are looking at

00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:51,870
these two blogs or are looking at this

00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:53,880
let's figure out why that pattern exists

00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:56,070
and maybe that's something that now that

00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:59,490
becomes a part of their lead generation

00:15:56,070 --> 00:16:01,440
or their lead nurturing process where

00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:03,090
they're sending a specific case study or

00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:05,450
a specific blog or a specific page on

00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:05,450
the site

00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:47,700
looking at maybe how they came to this

00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:50,030
site and what they're actually searching

00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:53,850
for that might help your conversation on

00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:55,380
why they're why they're buying yeah I

00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:57,840
like the idea of using data to like you

00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:59,370
mentioned Danielle I can also see maybe

00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:01,080
somebody even like an a/b test or some

00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:03,860
sort of way that you can sort of run

00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:05,760
either a B or multivariate test that

00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:08,940
that maybe tests either a value

00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:12,300
proposition or whether the hypothesis

00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:14,580
that personas currently represent can

00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:16,650
actually match well against um either

00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:18,210
alternative poetess or additional data

00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:19,920
that you're hearing or you're getting

00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:21,870
for your customers again I guess we're

00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:23,430
similar points about just you know

00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:27,330
making the case with data and being able

00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:29,070
to show show the product team that's you

00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:30,720
know these personas are absolutely great

00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:32,370
start there's there's a great data here

00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,860
and maybe like we're talking earlier

00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:36,180
they can evolve and and be receptive and

00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:40,520
be sensitive to new data that's coming

00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:40,520
in yes

00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:57,650
so behavior dad are you referring to

00:17:54,840 --> 00:18:10,230
like analytics yeah that sort of thing

00:17:57,650 --> 00:18:12,630
yeah that is great there's lots of great

00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:14,220
data from heat maps created from

00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:16,860
analytic software all mature you know

00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:18,690
Google X whatever it might be just my

00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:21,150
what I found personally is that data is

00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:22,440
great for showing us problem areas it

00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:23,250
weaknesses things to look at

00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:26,010
opportunities

00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:27,840
it doesn't always tell us sort of why

00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:32,220
something is happening and just doesn't

00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:33,630
always tell us you know what when we're

00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:37,140
seeing like a problem or some sort of

00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:38,340
breakdown what's causing that and what

00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:39,960
was the user is emotional state when

00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:44,430
they're when they're encountering that

00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:47,400
problem so we're so Nizar can be part of

00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:49,890
helping with that for sure also like you

00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:53,280
know things that machines can't tell us

00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:55,470
yet I'm sure they will next year it's

00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:56,550
just like you know watching a user walk

00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:57,690
through your website just something as

00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:59,090
simple as that like watching three or

00:18:57,690 --> 00:19:02,010
four users walk through your website

00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:04,380
assigning them some some common goals or

00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:07,800
tasks and understand and seeing you know

00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:09,750
whether the hypothesis and hypotheses

00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:13,070
you've formed through you know

00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:19,020
behavioral data are actually holding up

00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:20,340
that is you totally right so if you're

00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:22,170
including data as like qualitative

00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:23,910
quantitative in that then you're

00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:25,730
absolutely that's like to me personally

00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:27,690
that's by far the most valuable stuff

00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:29,180
whether or a persona comes out of that

00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:31,320
or there's just like summary of

00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:32,850
insightful quotes from from users or

00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:34,560
like a list or like patterns that you're

00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:35,730
hearing I think those all have value I

00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:37,710
don't think II have to choose one or the

00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:40,050
other if a persona isn't isn't isn't

00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:41,750
resonating your organization as long as

00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:44,850
the data that you're looking at is

00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:47,040
actually showing you really sort of

00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:48,580
highly ROI information I don't think

00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:51,309
it's necessary to have a persona

00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:53,649
I still think its value a little bit one

00:19:51,309 --> 00:19:55,389
quick thought on that I think personas

00:19:53,649 --> 00:19:56,919
can look different depending on whatever

00:19:55,389 --> 00:19:58,830
organization and making sure that you're

00:19:56,919 --> 00:20:01,659
just including the valuable information

00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:03,759
it could be seen as a way to name a

00:20:01,659 --> 00:20:06,249
pattern so maybe there's three patterns

00:20:03,759 --> 00:20:08,559
through your website it could be you

00:20:06,249 --> 00:20:10,749
know Cheryl is pattern one and this is

00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:12,219
how they move through being able to do

00:20:10,749 --> 00:20:14,019
that helps everyone have kind of a

00:20:12,219 --> 00:20:16,119
common language about how to address

00:20:14,019 --> 00:20:19,149
different decisions that need to be made

00:20:16,119 --> 00:20:22,119
I think it's something that we can fall

00:20:19,149 --> 00:20:23,379
into is you know looking googling what a

00:20:22,119 --> 00:20:24,969
persona is and making sure you're

00:20:23,379 --> 00:20:27,190
including all the same information that

00:20:24,969 --> 00:20:29,619
everyone across the internet is doing

00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:31,269
but if it's not relevant to you I don't

00:20:29,619 --> 00:20:33,070
see any purpose and including it just

00:20:31,269 --> 00:20:34,749
making sure there's the value that you

00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:36,129
need out of them yeah I know a lot of

00:20:34,749 --> 00:20:36,820
personas have like day in the life they

00:20:36,129 --> 00:20:39,219
have all these different categories

00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:42,009
sometimes it's just pain points and

00:20:39,219 --> 00:20:43,599
goals is really like need to see from a

00:20:42,009 --> 00:20:45,759
design perspective sometimes they can

00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:47,169
come in a lot of value especially when

00:20:45,759 --> 00:20:49,269
you're talking about age ranges of

00:20:47,169 --> 00:20:50,799
people I decide you're gonna design for

00:20:49,269 --> 00:20:52,089
an 18 year old is look I'm gonna look a

00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:58,169
lot different than I thought you're

00:20:52,089 --> 00:20:58,169
designing for someone in 50s right so

00:21:00,179 --> 00:21:07,029
true but you I think the user persona

00:21:03,099 --> 00:21:09,369
development you more understand what

00:21:07,029 --> 00:21:11,139
exactly their goals and their challenges

00:21:09,369 --> 00:21:13,119
and their emotion emotional states

00:21:11,139 --> 00:21:14,529
essentially which can also be help

00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:19,389
convey with design and you're not going

00:21:14,529 --> 00:21:22,209
to get that out of analytics just on

00:21:19,389 --> 00:21:24,129
that note from a question of my own if

00:21:22,209 --> 00:21:28,889
you would if you had a limited budget

00:21:24,129 --> 00:21:32,619
and limited time what would be the go-to

00:21:28,889 --> 00:21:34,389
to tools or methods you would use would

00:21:32,619 --> 00:21:37,329
it be analytics would be surveys would

00:21:34,389 --> 00:21:41,019
it be building user flows is there a

00:21:37,329 --> 00:21:48,849
hierarchy of this budget Jeff ten

00:21:41,019 --> 00:21:50,559
dollars so say I feel like I feel like

00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:53,109
all the above is are accomplishable

00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:54,279
within a fairly small budget if we maybe

00:21:53,109 --> 00:21:57,099
think about different numbers or Trinity

00:21:54,279 --> 00:21:59,240
is a small way small means but like

00:21:57,099 --> 00:22:01,490
analytics okay the vast majority of

00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:03,440
have Google Linux installed somebody

00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:04,790
who's skilled at extracting meaningful

00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,679
note numbers from that and not just like

00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:07,700
in aggregates drilling down and getting

00:22:06,679 --> 00:22:09,830
good slices of data

00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:11,570
um that's gonna have value and so I can

00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:12,590
take that much work maybe even a few

00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:15,940
hours we'll probably give you something

00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:18,980
useful user flows or things that

00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:20,780
probably don't they could consume 500

00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:22,850
hours or they could consume five hours

00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:24,140
and I think even the five our effort is

00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:25,580
often worth the worthwhile impeded video

00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:29,750
right and there's one more thing that

00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:32,270
you mentioned surveys yeah obviously

00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:34,910
there are universities that have entire

00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:36,200
programs to teach people about research

00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:38,240
methods and qualitative quantitative

00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:39,770
data so you can go like all out and

00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:42,740
creating like very like well vetted

00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:44,960
surveys that have like incredibly you

00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:46,730
know strong statistical validity or you

00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,390
can do a quick survey that asks a few

00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:49,670
questions

00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:51,020
get it out relatively quickly and get

00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:53,120
some great data back again and both are

00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:55,010
great approaches but even for a small

00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:57,050
project surveys I think have quite a lot

00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:58,670
of value especially if you can depends

00:22:57,050 --> 00:23:01,130
on how big of a sample size you have and

00:22:58,670 --> 00:23:06,620
how how much you can pester them and tap

00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:09,290
them on the shoulder but yeah of course

00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:10,880
I think nice problem sure that

00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:12,380
definitely is your testing but I guess

00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:14,150
like I guess that's a question is if

00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:17,300
like some organizations they're either

00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:18,980
are concerned about bothering their

00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:20,270
their customers maybe their customers

00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:23,900
very high value maybe their customers or

00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:25,700
CEOs so sometimes user testing is very

00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:27,920
possible like for a university can test

00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:29,990
prospective students respective parents

00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:31,640
and stuff like that if you if your

00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:33,290
product you sell to five hundred people

00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:34,940
around the world and each one of those

00:23:33,290 --> 00:23:36,020
is worth 50 million or hundred million

00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:37,250
dollars you might be a little more

00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:39,470
hesitant to ask them to come in and

00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:40,550
click through a website so you know

00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:43,700
there's various ways you can get to this

00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:45,140
this data yeah I think I think talking

00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:47,090
about the project and it all goals the

00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:48,800
project probably also has to be it can't

00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:50,570
be this like a recipe that this is

00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:52,130
always the go-to thing because all

00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:55,870
projects are so different and it really

00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:55,870
depends on what your aim

00:24:01,810 --> 00:24:10,820
so I have a phrase that I ask or tell my

00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:14,750
people work don't believe everything you

00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:19,250
think so it's and it's often true I

00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:20,990
think that we we create content by

00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:24,680
ourselves for people who are not like

00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:32,060
ourselves and so it's often a challenge

00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:33,890
to keep pushing people to think unlike

00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:36,440
ourselves and one thing we talked about

00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:40,250
earlier was accessibility and how when

00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:42,890
we talk about accessibility we typically

00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:44,510
think about colors and screen readers

00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:46,790
and stuff but Cheryl actually had some

00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:49,610
really interesting ideas on that no just

00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:52,190
wondering if you have accessibility is

00:24:49,610 --> 00:24:53,450
not just for those who are disabled

00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:56,090
individuals trying to access the

00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:58,370
Internet it also affects me when I'm on

00:24:56,090 --> 00:25:00,410
my mobile phone in a really dark room or

00:24:58,370 --> 00:25:02,570
I'm out in the middle of a field I don't

00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:05,170
I have really low Wi-Fi so there's a lot

00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:08,060
of other considerations outside of just

00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:10,940
disability considerations that need you

00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:14,570
know that can affect someone's ability

00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:16,310
to access your website in a experience

00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:24,010
that's not going to make them go away

00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:24,010
really quick not just thinking about

00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:30,050
like the various contexts of use and

00:25:27,410 --> 00:25:32,360
conditions of people is great

00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:34,970
can you give us some examples of how

00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:39,200
you've implemented that in in different

00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:41,210
projects you've had as far as yeah they

00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:43,850
like the how you how you've thought

00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:48,440
about the project in those terms and you

00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:51,110
know in terms of you know that access to

00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:53,420
Wi-Fi you know people like me who are

00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:58,310
having trouble reading as we get over

00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:59,990
that kind of is a really important font

00:25:58,310 --> 00:26:01,610
sizes we have you know standard best

00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:02,720
practices of the smallest font size

00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:04,040
you'd ever want to use on a mobile

00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:07,570
device you don't want to go smaller than

00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:10,130
you know like for example 1415 pixels

00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:11,600
you can break your content up in smaller

00:26:10,130 --> 00:26:15,260
bite-sized chunks so people with

00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:18,320
cognitive disabilities can can absorb

00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:20,810
the information more easily breaking

00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:22,670
adding subtitles and clear titles to all

00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:24,500
of your paragraphs so someone

00:26:22,670 --> 00:26:29,000
understands what they're getting ready

00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:31,160
to delve into deeper giving them you

00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,290
know clear pathways to access the

00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:35,270
information by having your header tags

00:26:33,290 --> 00:26:37,850
all in the correct order so that as

00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:39,200
they're you know using their screen

00:26:37,850 --> 00:26:40,850
readers to go through the page they're

00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,960
not you know fumbling all over the place

00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:45,410
and going from the top and the bottom

00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:46,250
and sideways so those considerations are

00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:49,790
really important when it comes to

00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:51,290
content as well as like Wi-Fi access the

00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:52,790
size of your images that you add to your

00:26:51,290 --> 00:26:55,310
website you know that can really slow

00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:57,530
down the amount of functionality and an

00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:59,510
interactivity that you add if there are

00:26:57,530 --> 00:27:01,190
careful considerations made during the

00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:02,840
development process you can really slow

00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:05,810
down the time and effort it takes to

00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:07,160
load a page and I guess as Google pays

00:27:05,810 --> 00:27:09,830
more attention to signals about

00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:12,440
usability like performance mobile

00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:14,810
friendliness you know semantics the

00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:16,160
semantics nature of the way that the

00:27:14,810 --> 00:27:17,690
page is constructed how easy it is to

00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:20,270
find stuff and even metrics like

00:27:17,690 --> 00:27:22,850
engagement you know that there's the

00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:24,440
argument to be made to sort of make the

00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:26,960
site more occlusive and to make the site

00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:29,320
just more available to more people

00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:31,690
there's also just an ROI and like

00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:33,460
business argument we made that

00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:35,200
that doing these things it's kind of the

00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:38,460
way the web is going anyway

00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:40,360
and a lot of the companies that are

00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:43,540
that's not say in charge of our lives

00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:45,130
but influence our lives hey how you know

00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:47,590
they're really pay attention to all

00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:50,410
these things we're talking about and you

00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:52,720
know they're they're starting to not

00:27:50,410 --> 00:27:54,010
starting to already factoring that

00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:55,600
deeply into the rank and their ranking

00:27:54,010 --> 00:27:57,810
algorithms I'm talking about Google

00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,810
today

00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:12,820
we're getting reports now unlike whether

00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:14,740
the touch area on mobile sites is so

00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:18,130
just to continue our own discussion with

00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:23,350
those influences those big companies not

00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:27,250
to be named there's obviously one of the

00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:29,440
kind of google factors is dwell time and

00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:33,850
the the amount of time that users are

00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:35,980
spending on that on on the content that

00:28:33,850 --> 00:28:39,910
that brings into the the question long

00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:41,800
pages and how if you do put all of your

00:28:39,910 --> 00:28:43,870
content on one page which is quite a

00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:45,880
common design implementation these days

00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:48,790
we just scroll and scroll and scroll the

00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:50,740
question is how is that how do you feel

00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:53,320
about those I mean given that it could

00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:55,390
affect search engine optimization with

00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:57,220
what are you what are you keywords have

00:28:55,390 --> 00:28:59,560
you keeping you know you've people

00:28:57,220 --> 00:29:01,600
finding the right information on that

00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:02,920
page how do you go about dealing with

00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:09,370
that kind of concept now that that's

00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:11,770
becoming quite quite common one of the

00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:15,100
things that I always try to run through

00:29:11,770 --> 00:29:17,920
the filter is a filter that I think

00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:19,540
through is humans first I think we're

00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:21,190
gonna design for humans and what they're

00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:22,720
looking for and you know if you have a

00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:25,420
good understanding of who your personas

00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:28,600
are and you know that all of you know

00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:31,600
this amount of information needs to be

00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:34,300
on the on a specific page and that's

00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:36,100
what they're looking for then I think

00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:37,290
that that's great I think the the

00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:39,150
pattern of

00:29:37,290 --> 00:29:41,220
just how technology is shifted

00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:42,540
cellphones are obviously becoming more

00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:46,530
and more popular more and more people

00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:48,900
are having smartphones then scrolling is

00:29:46,530 --> 00:29:50,040
just becoming normal its what people do

00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:51,360
like I don't know if you guys have gone

00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:54,390
up to your laptop and tried to scroll

00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:56,660
before I definitely have so it's just

00:29:54,390 --> 00:30:00,270
it's becoming something that people are

00:29:56,660 --> 00:30:01,590
anticipating anyways so as long as it

00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:05,220
doesn't hinder that user experience if

00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:07,770
it doesn't hinder what your users need

00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:09,360
to get out of a specific page I think

00:30:07,770 --> 00:30:13,800
that there's a lot of positive things to

00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:17,670
having a design style like that I think

00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:18,750
it depends on what you're trying to what

00:30:17,670 --> 00:30:21,030
you're trying to explain or what you're

00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:22,350
trying to persuade and on that page you

00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:24,450
know there's lots of there's lots of

00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:25,800
great conversion case studies of long

00:30:24,450 --> 00:30:28,440
pages versus short pages like crazy I

00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:31,470
did did one conversion rate that's where

00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:33,330
it said one that showed in their cases I

00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:36,000
think monsters will as well that long

00:30:33,330 --> 00:30:38,070
pages vastly up perform short pages but

00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:41,280
I think you can't just make that

00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:42,840
decision without understanding you know

00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:44,460
what your users how much you contact

00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:46,110
users can absorb a how much they're

00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:48,540
looking to absorb how much they need to

00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:50,760
know before making decision we've seen

00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:52,890
our own research on non product sites

00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:57,440
like recreation centers and higher

00:30:52,890 --> 00:30:59,850
education sites more and more users are

00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:02,370
becoming more impatient with a little

00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:04,740
bit longer pages and looking looking for

00:31:02,370 --> 00:31:06,390
things to be sort of truncated

00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:08,210
especially if they perceive even one

00:31:06,390 --> 00:31:11,360
block on that page to be irrelevant it's

00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:14,670
there's a disproportionately negative

00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:15,810
impact a lot of times they've been

00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:17,370
looking at a desktop they say well this

00:31:15,810 --> 00:31:19,500
is fine and then they go on the phone

00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:20,730
I'm lost there are seven or eight sort

00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:22,500
of sections here and I'm really

00:31:20,730 --> 00:31:25,860
struggling to figure out you know how

00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:27,660
this all relates so I think you can long

00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:28,890
pages can work really well as long as

00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:30,750
they're extremely well structured tell

00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:32,490
story very clearly and if they're the

00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:33,780
right choice and you and you consider

00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:35,670
the short versus long and how much

00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:37,080
impression you need to present to people

00:31:35,670 --> 00:31:38,529
could do don't read on about anyway they

00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:41,779
just ask man

00:31:38,529 --> 00:31:42,679
so and this again is from a personal

00:31:41,779 --> 00:31:45,229
experience that we're going through

00:31:42,679 --> 00:31:48,439
right now is with long pages you know

00:31:45,229 --> 00:31:50,329
there's a lot of a lot of times people

00:31:48,439 --> 00:31:52,999
will say well let's just accordion those

00:31:50,329 --> 00:31:55,279
up so you just see the the one line and

00:31:52,999 --> 00:31:58,339
people can expand those whenever they

00:31:55,279 --> 00:32:02,179
want I'm in two minds about that given

00:31:58,339 --> 00:32:04,789
that you if you are hiding content in

00:32:02,179 --> 00:32:07,189
any way shape or form you're actually by

00:32:04,789 --> 00:32:09,709
taking that out of the users view it's

00:32:07,189 --> 00:32:13,039
compromising the content do you have any

00:32:09,709 --> 00:32:16,189
any ideas on it kind of depends on the

00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:19,129
content if it's extremely long text

00:32:16,189 --> 00:32:21,499
heavy content and there's four sections

00:32:19,129 --> 00:32:22,939
of long hex text heavy content do you

00:32:21,499 --> 00:32:24,679
want your user to scroll through all of

00:32:22,939 --> 00:32:26,959
that on a mobile device or by providing

00:32:24,679 --> 00:32:28,789
them the title and it collapse formats

00:32:26,959 --> 00:32:30,589
they can see all four titles at once

00:32:28,789 --> 00:32:32,389
say oh I want the one that's number four

00:32:30,589 --> 00:32:33,589
not the one that saw so that kind of

00:32:32,389 --> 00:32:36,199
saves them time and maybe user

00:32:33,589 --> 00:32:37,789
frustration of having to scroll so on a

00:32:36,199 --> 00:32:39,319
mobile devices it can come in handy but

00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:41,059
like I said it's important of what

00:32:39,319 --> 00:32:42,049
content you're talking about certain

00:32:41,059 --> 00:32:48,229
things you're certainly not going to

00:32:42,049 --> 00:32:50,119
want to bury for example sure like a

00:32:48,229 --> 00:32:51,769
higher education website they have a

00:32:50,119 --> 00:32:53,779
whole list of courses and within each

00:32:51,769 --> 00:32:56,029
under each course title they have like a

00:32:53,779 --> 00:32:57,469
description and the date and all the

00:32:56,029 --> 00:32:59,779
information about that particular course

00:32:57,469 --> 00:33:01,999
but maybe there's 40 courses on this

00:32:59,779 --> 00:33:03,739
page so we don't want the user to have

00:33:01,999 --> 00:33:05,059
to scroll through all that content

00:33:03,739 --> 00:33:07,729
they're just looking for the course

00:33:05,059 --> 00:33:09,109
title and we know that so they can find

00:33:07,729 --> 00:33:10,069
the course title and then expand it to

00:33:09,109 --> 00:33:16,089
see the information that they're

00:33:10,069 --> 00:33:16,089
desiring and we hope there's a question

00:33:49,749 --> 00:33:58,840
please we talked about the scrolling

00:33:56,529 --> 00:34:00,940
fatigue for narrative structures again

00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:02,739
this not be to be just this is me trying

00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:05,619
to tell compelling stories about how

00:34:02,739 --> 00:34:11,619
awesome my university is how do you come

00:34:05,619 --> 00:34:15,129
back that yeah I guess like we've

00:34:11,619 --> 00:34:16,839
definitely seen like a 70% people so you

00:34:15,129 --> 00:34:19,059
said a 70% drop oh is that right so 30%

00:34:16,839 --> 00:34:20,829
of people are making it - yeah only like

00:34:19,059 --> 00:34:23,460
30 people are making it to the very very

00:34:20,829 --> 00:34:25,270
end of the story and so we're obviously

00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:27,460
structuring things where the most

00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:29,770
important bits are at the top but we're

00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:31,809
trying to be creative with embedding

00:34:29,770 --> 00:34:34,839
different kinds of media throughout the

00:34:31,809 --> 00:34:37,510
stories not only to encourage people to

00:34:34,839 --> 00:34:39,099
keep scrolling but because it looks

00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:40,480
stupid when you just jam all the stuff

00:34:39,099 --> 00:34:42,369
on the first two graphs do didn't mean

00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:46,359
so we're trying to be intentional about

00:34:42,369 --> 00:34:48,579
it have you tried a/b testing we have

00:34:46,359 --> 00:34:52,059
not as often as we should but that's a

00:34:48,579 --> 00:34:54,579
great suggestion like things that kind

00:34:52,059 --> 00:34:55,929
of you may be a play already to help

00:34:54,579 --> 00:34:57,730
people kind of jump to sections that

00:34:55,929 --> 00:35:00,579
might be relevant to them like I know a

00:34:57,730 --> 00:35:02,500
lot of sites use and jump in here's a

00:35:00,579 --> 00:35:05,020
kind of sticky let's have a tactical UI

00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:06,490
on it but just different ways of letting

00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:08,910
people know let's say they're on the

00:35:06,490 --> 00:35:11,710
admissions page or they're on a mission

00:35:08,910 --> 00:35:13,140
intention financial aid page and there

00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:16,150
they want to see

00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:18,279
scholarships they want to see you know

00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:20,079
the process of applying they want to see

00:35:18,279 --> 00:35:21,410
you know various various pieces of date

00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:23,990
like by piece of data let's say

00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:26,089
big buckets structuring that information

00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:27,289
they can jump to the 0.4 quickly 0.5

00:35:26,089 --> 00:35:29,089
quickly it's really really helpful a

00:35:27,289 --> 00:35:33,940
little bit tricky on a small screen but

00:35:29,089 --> 00:35:33,940
there's ways of doing that yeah thank so

00:35:35,259 --> 00:35:44,170
also with regard to content on on web

00:35:39,650 --> 00:35:46,549
pages again this from my past experience

00:35:44,170 --> 00:35:49,039
I've always wondered whether it should

00:35:46,549 --> 00:35:51,619
be one page one one purpose so you come

00:35:49,039 --> 00:35:55,490
to the site you go to the page and you

00:35:51,619 --> 00:35:59,450
hit a page and the information you get

00:35:55,490 --> 00:36:02,660
on that page is itemizes it's your

00:35:59,450 --> 00:36:05,329
atomic page for example and an example

00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:07,190
that I can point to is Nielsen which is

00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:09,680
a usability website and if you go to one

00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:12,500
of their web pages they will have in red

00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:14,539
at the top essentially a summary of what

00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:18,559
this page will be what what the user is

00:36:14,539 --> 00:36:20,750
going to get from this page I've tried

00:36:18,559 --> 00:36:23,569
to push that into my own company's

00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:26,059
website but got pushed back so my

00:36:23,569 --> 00:36:33,500
question is is that a good idea

00:36:26,059 --> 00:36:36,500
you need if not why not take a stab at

00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:38,720
that first I think every question of

00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:40,789
good or bad is you have to look at the

00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:43,190
context of it the way I would approach

00:36:40,789 --> 00:36:44,539
it is looking at the topics that you

00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:46,970
want to talk about and then thinking

00:36:44,539 --> 00:36:49,130
about how is the user going to consume

00:36:46,970 --> 00:36:52,299
this information so if they always

00:36:49,130 --> 00:36:56,089
consume a B and C and then sometimes the

00:36:52,299 --> 00:36:58,220
having a B and C together might make

00:36:56,089 --> 00:36:59,960
sense and then they can go to D if they

00:36:58,220 --> 00:37:02,150
need more information but really

00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:04,490
thinking about how is the user gonna

00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:06,470
consume this information and maybe maybe

00:37:04,490 --> 00:37:09,079
they look a little bit different she

00:37:06,470 --> 00:37:11,299
like the internal content editor but

00:37:09,079 --> 00:37:12,769
maybe to the consumer all over the the

00:37:11,299 --> 00:37:15,079
customer all of this information is the

00:37:12,769 --> 00:37:16,609
same so I'd probably start asking those

00:37:15,079 --> 00:37:19,640
questions before I would make like a

00:37:16,609 --> 00:37:22,190
blanket statement of always have you

00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:24,210
know one specific topic max of 300 words

00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:27,569
or you know any restrictions

00:37:24,210 --> 00:37:29,099
the page telling that what you can tell

00:37:27,569 --> 00:37:32,510
them up front is really possible having

00:37:29,099 --> 00:37:35,520
some sort not graph early and you know a

00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:36,839
lot of these kind of topic areas have

00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:38,280
come back to like what our users wanted

00:37:36,839 --> 00:37:40,980
what what are their goals were their

00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:43,589
primary goals if a user does come to a

00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:45,720
page and they can't tell fairly quickly

00:37:43,589 --> 00:37:47,910
if the information they came to the page

00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:50,910
to get is available on that page I think

00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:51,960
it can be be motivating so we talked

00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:55,140
about like various techniques like

00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:56,880
obviously Yeltsin Norman does the sort

00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:59,430
of sort of graph in the talk which is a

00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:01,770
great idea or you know having some sort

00:37:59,430 --> 00:38:03,599
of survenu way to sort of go through the

00:38:01,770 --> 00:38:05,550
content you want well just make it clear

00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:06,750
to the user or shortening the page all

00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:09,660
kinds of didn't ways you can do that I

00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:12,119
think the key goal is do I have to

00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:13,740
scroll down four screens to find that

00:38:12,119 --> 00:38:14,819
one piece of information that I want and

00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:24,569
do I even know that that's even

00:38:14,819 --> 00:38:29,430
available on this page so we're coming

00:38:24,569 --> 00:38:30,900
into the last seven minutes so I'd ask

00:38:29,430 --> 00:38:37,680
if there are any questions that are

00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:40,099
still out there in the field there's a

00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:40,099
microphone

00:38:45,450 --> 00:38:58,109
so talking about analytics what are some

00:38:49,619 --> 00:39:00,030
key metrics and what are some key

00:38:58,109 --> 00:39:04,520
metrics that you guys look at that you

00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:09,359
use to then better optimize better

00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:10,559
design your website for your user it was

00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:11,910
funny because we talked about it a

00:39:10,559 --> 00:39:14,640
little bit in one of the earlier

00:39:11,910 --> 00:39:17,339
sessions of sometimes the most easiest

00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:21,540
metrics that you can pinpoint are not

00:39:17,339 --> 00:39:25,650
always the ones that you want to look at

00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:28,109
such as bounce rate so can you guys what

00:39:25,650 --> 00:39:30,900
do you look for in what metrics do you

00:39:28,109 --> 00:39:35,670
look at and really use in designing and

00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:42,780
optimizing your website that is a big

00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:45,510
question I'll get you a list later no a

00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:46,650
lot of it is you know I keep going back

00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:48,839
I feel like a broken record but a lot of

00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:51,210
it is associated with your goals right

00:39:48,839 --> 00:39:52,890
so I like to look at bounce rate but

00:39:51,210 --> 00:39:55,200
whether or not bounce rate is good

00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:57,030
depends on what my goals are if it's a

00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:59,099
conversion page and people are bouncing

00:39:57,030 --> 00:40:01,920
after that then you know maybe that's

00:39:59,099 --> 00:40:04,049
okay or if it's something that I it's

00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:05,970
the entry level page and I want them to

00:40:04,049 --> 00:40:08,250
navigate through the site a high bounce

00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:09,869
rate is not good and I need to take a

00:40:08,250 --> 00:40:12,119
look at that

00:40:09,869 --> 00:40:15,450
you know if there's if it's a blog page

00:40:12,119 --> 00:40:16,890
and the time on site is 10 seconds well

00:40:15,450 --> 00:40:19,589
that's probably not good because who can

00:40:16,890 --> 00:40:21,569
read an entire blog in 10 seconds so a

00:40:19,589 --> 00:40:23,760
lot of it deals with with the context

00:40:21,569 --> 00:40:25,500
but I typically start with a lot of the

00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:28,109
engagement metrics how many times are

00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:30,960
people visiting a site are they a

00:40:28,109 --> 00:40:33,059
specific page how often are they going

00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:35,549
to the next page that I want them to go

00:40:33,059 --> 00:40:39,690
to I think looking at things like

00:40:35,549 --> 00:40:41,220
conversion rate are they you know like

00:40:39,690 --> 00:40:43,410
are they accomplishing the goals that

00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:48,329
you want them to on this site or are

00:40:43,410 --> 00:40:50,099
they bouncing off I like to look at you

00:40:48,329 --> 00:40:51,090
know the most frequent pages people are

00:40:50,099 --> 00:40:53,040
visiting

00:40:51,090 --> 00:41:00,420
I like to look at where people are

00:40:53,040 --> 00:41:01,740
exiting the site yeah so I definitely

00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:04,800
tend to fall more on the qualitative

00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:06,600
side it's probably good customer but I

00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:10,560
definitely feel strongly analytics are

00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:14,370
really important part of the puzzle even

00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:15,420
just stuff like understanding how

00:41:14,370 --> 00:41:17,790
behavior might be different from them

00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:19,220
from various form factors that could

00:41:17,790 --> 00:41:22,140
evolve all versus the desktop

00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:26,370
understanding you know how to prioritize

00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:28,200
the content and what and how much to pay

00:41:26,370 --> 00:41:30,840
attention to knowing that we can't look

00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:33,720
at 500 or 5,000 pages maybe just

00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:36,030
understanding what pages or the most

00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:38,210
popular that it actually yeah can't heat

00:41:36,030 --> 00:41:40,320
and get traffic and then understanding

00:41:38,210 --> 00:41:42,740
that can not only help us understand

00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:44,820
where priority might go in terms of like

00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:46,650
best user experience best content

00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:47,850
experience but also just prioritizing

00:41:46,650 --> 00:41:49,740
things like navigation like what you

00:41:47,850 --> 00:41:51,450
come first what you come last

00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:53,730
those things definitely how to percent

00:41:51,450 --> 00:41:57,120
the information on demographics is also

00:41:53,730 --> 00:41:59,430
getting better and better the gender of

00:41:57,120 --> 00:42:03,780
age of all these things can be quite

00:41:59,430 --> 00:42:07,290
quite useful certainly its most useful

00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:08,760
if you can disaggregate it as like

00:42:07,290 --> 00:42:10,980
instead of just looking at a general

00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:13,350
bounce rate or general mobile use it

00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:16,470
into some sort of slice that is actually

00:42:13,350 --> 00:42:19,170
being pulling useful like type you know

00:42:16,470 --> 00:42:20,580
looking at users who dropped off at a

00:42:19,170 --> 00:42:22,290
certain point like what what are some

00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:23,880
characteristics of that user or their

00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:25,500
experience and then I guess the other

00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:27,630
part which doesn't come out of the box

00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:31,440
but a lot of people do is is actual

00:42:27,630 --> 00:42:33,740
conversion goals and an actual tracking

00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:36,120
the journey I think that's not to me is

00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:40,980
often more valuable than seeing like

00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:42,300
page depth or or you know how my page

00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:44,900
because I'm a page could be good or it

00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:48,600
could be not good at all depending on

00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:50,340
sorry just apologies we have two minutes

00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:53,010
to go and they're pretty strict on on

00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:55,500
finishing up so if you'd like to come up

00:42:53,010 --> 00:42:57,840
and talk to the experts not me just

00:42:55,500 --> 00:43:00,010
these guys after the after the talk

00:42:57,840 --> 00:43:02,020
that'd be great

00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:04,390
and I might just finish with one quick

00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:06,340
question if we've got to the death of

00:43:04,390 --> 00:43:08,830
the panel just to shake him up a bit

00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:11,560
no really it's for you guys last ten

00:43:08,830 --> 00:43:13,420
minutes my question is what is the most

00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:15,760
important skills you've learned on the

00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:21,040
job that you think the guys here could

00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:24,900
take away and into their practice I'll

00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:27,310
take that being an advocate for the user

00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:28,720
empathy understanding where they're

00:43:27,310 --> 00:43:32,680
coming from putting myself in their

00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:34,300
shoes it's not about the company's goals

00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:36,640
necessary of course it is about the

00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:39,880
company's goals but understanding who's

00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:42,040
visiting the website and just keeping

00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:47,560
that a top of mine with every decision

00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:49,690
that I make when I'm designing one thing

00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:52,690
that I started in the company in a sales

00:43:49,690 --> 00:43:54,010
role and you know when you're on a lot

00:43:52,690 --> 00:43:56,290
of times on your sales call you get sort

00:43:54,010 --> 00:43:57,490
of a handoff similar to this experience

00:43:56,290 --> 00:43:59,770
actually where you have somebody kind of

00:43:57,490 --> 00:44:00,910
moderating you kind of say here's PR

00:43:59,770 --> 00:44:04,000
news coming in as the expert on

00:44:00,910 --> 00:44:06,100
something and you know I think it's very

00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,570
valuable for people to have really

00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:09,130
strong to me and expertise one of things

00:44:07,570 --> 00:44:10,480
I've learned is just be comfortable

00:44:09,130 --> 00:44:12,400
saying I don't know or let's find out

00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:13,720
you know I'm not I don't have the

00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:17,830
rancher at the ready right now

00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:20,500
because a lot of times you know you a

00:44:17,830 --> 00:44:21,820
lot of groups can look towards to what

00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:23,619
they considered expert or even C to say

00:44:21,820 --> 00:44:26,500
like you know tell us what what we

00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:29,970
should do but I feel like best practices

00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:32,050
are great and report n't but have to be

00:44:29,970 --> 00:44:33,430
you know you have to factor in the

00:44:32,050 --> 00:44:37,770
uncertainties that we should you know

00:44:33,430 --> 00:44:37,770
acknowledge look at and explore

00:44:38,339 --> 00:44:43,920
okay yes I can be quick asking questions

00:44:41,150 --> 00:44:46,410
being able to just be curious about

00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:49,049
whatever the challenge is asking

00:44:46,410 --> 00:44:51,720
questions of all of the different people

00:44:49,049 --> 00:44:54,950
around the whatever the challenges or

00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:57,359
whatever the project is to get various

00:44:54,950 --> 00:44:58,950
various perspectives and the context

00:44:57,359 --> 00:45:02,700
that you need to make good strategic

00:44:58,950 --> 00:45:03,749
decisions okay I'd like to thank the

00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:06,680
panel and thanks very much for coming

00:45:03,749 --> 00:45:06,680
along this afternoon

00:45:09,349 --> 00:45:13,609
