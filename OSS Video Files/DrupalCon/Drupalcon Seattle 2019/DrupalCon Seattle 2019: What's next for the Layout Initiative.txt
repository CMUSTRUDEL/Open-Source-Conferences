Title: DrupalCon Seattle 2019: What's next for the Layout Initiative
Publication date: 2019-04-12
Playlist: Drupalcon Seattle 2019
Description: 
	After over two years of work done by the Layout Initiative, Drupal 8.7 is slated to be the first release of Drupal Core to includeÂ a stable layout tool.

This tool, Layout Builder, is primarily intended for content editors to use for simply making complex pages. It is also a powerful site building tool that affords great flexibility across all content.

Attendees do not need any prior experience with Layout Builder. Comparisons will be made to existing layout tools like Panels, Panelizer, Display Suite, Block UI, and Paragraphs.
