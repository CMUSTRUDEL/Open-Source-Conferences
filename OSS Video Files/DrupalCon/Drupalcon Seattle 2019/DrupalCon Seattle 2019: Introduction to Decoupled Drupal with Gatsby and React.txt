Publication date: 2019-04-12
Playlist: Drupalcon Seattle 2019
Description: 
	Decoupling Drupal is nothing new but it remains a great way to building websites that go beyond Drupal.  In the past few years so many tools and options have become available which allows for a decoupled Drupal solution.  Today we will learn about GatsbyJS, a react based Static Site Generator (SSG), that makes it easy to built a React Front-End while keeping the power of Drupal in the back end as well as all the editorial tools Drupal offers.

Gatsby is an incredibly fast static site generator which offers a growing number of plugins to extend its functionality.  In this session we will use the gatsby-source-drupal plugin which simplifies calls to Drupal APIs and retrieve content.  Gatsby in addition to being React ready it also offers GraphQL which is a great way to query/pull data from most data sources including CMS, Databases, API, Google Sheets and more.This sounds like a pretty complicated process and it can actually be, however, Gatsby makes it very easy and powerful. 



 Level of knowledge needed:

Individual planning on attending this session should have basic knwledge of

installing and enabling Drupal modules as well as
basics of GraphQL and React although not required.


You will learn:

In this session we will create an API endpoint in Drupal using the JSON API Module, which Gatsby will use to retrieve our site content such a Article nodes and render them as React pages or components.

At the end of this session you will have a good understanding how Gatsby, in combination with React can help you create a React-based Front End while Drupal provides the Back End and editorial power.
