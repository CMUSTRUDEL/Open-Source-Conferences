When people buy products and services today, they're looking for more than just a promise fulfilled; they're looking for life-enhancing experiencesÂ both online and offline. But how do you go about delivering the kind of experiences that not only satisfy customers but turn them into brand believers so that you grow as fast as possible? It takes a deep commitment to nurturing your community, to building a company culture with shared values, and to leveraging technology to do it with speed and excellence.

you'll see that as a practitioner heavy

00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:07,529
practitioner in the world of marketing

00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:09,690
and marketing technology might have a

00:00:07,529 --> 00:00:11,849
different spin but it's very grounded

00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:12,929
and very consistent with a lot of what

00:00:11,849 --> 00:00:15,719
you just learned from Scott

00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:18,449
so as Lisa said I'm at least afaik I'm

00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:21,750
the former CMO of tableau software I've

00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:24,720
recently retired I retired back at the

00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:26,670
end of 2019 after eleven years in a

00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:30,570
journey where we went from about three

00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:33,030
marketers when I started and no CMS to

00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:36,420
300 marketers in a very well-developed

00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:38,610
CMS with a heavy mark tech stack we went

00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:41,160
from about 5 million in revenue to a

00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:42,930
billion which was a long journey and we

00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:46,140
went from a startup that nobody had ever

00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:48,420
heard of to IPO to then being a publicly

00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:50,850
held company that was a leader in its

00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:52,620
space so over this 11 years I got to

00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:55,020
learn a lot I got to do a lot of things

00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:56,129
I got to make a lot of mistakes I got a

00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:57,690
lot of smart people that helped me

00:00:56,129 --> 00:01:00,120
correct those mistakes and do better and

00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:04,530
mostly like I said I learned a lot and

00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:07,170
so I wanted to start today with my idea

00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:09,270
of what the secret formula was okay so

00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:10,020
are you ready for the secret formula all

00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:13,470
right here we go

00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:17,189
secret formula to growth is really quite

00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:20,430
simple it's great brands attract

00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:23,250
prospects prospects Attis fide prospects

00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:25,490
become customers and happy customers

00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:28,920
lead to community and guess what

00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:32,640
community amplifies your brand which

00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:35,460
then leads to more prospects more

00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,740
community more brand it's a compounding

00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:39,240
formula that we have here and it's

00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:41,130
really pretty simple

00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:44,070
maybe simpler than you expected but

00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:46,020
simple doesn't make easy and so let's

00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:47,970
look at it another way I want to look at

00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:49,860
it as the as a customer journey and I

00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:51,780
want to look at it in that context of

00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:53,579
what marketing does to influence that

00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:55,619
customer journey so that customer

00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:57,540
journey pretty much is you know a person

00:01:55,619 --> 00:01:59,189
is totally unaware of their problem and

00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:01,500
certainly of your product or service

00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:02,729
then through some efforts maybe they

00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,960
become aware of their problem they

00:02:02,729 --> 00:02:06,390
become aware of your customer so they

00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:08,039
become an aware of prospect then there's

00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:10,289
the whole journey the next phase of them

00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:12,150
going from being an aware prospect to

00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:13,620
getting them to be assigned customer

00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:15,810
what are you doing to help them

00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:18,510
become part of your franchise part of

00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:20,190
your organisation's customer base but

00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:22,200
that doesn't stop there especially in

00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:24,150
the world of SAS and subscription models

00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,950
it's not enough to just sign them and

00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:27,870
have them be customers you also have to

00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:29,700
make them be successful it helped them

00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:31,769
go from just customer to successful

00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:33,629
customer to wanting to be part of your

00:02:31,769 --> 00:02:35,280
community to wanting to be part of what

00:02:33,629 --> 00:02:37,349
you stand for and what you represent and

00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,360
then again it's a cycle it's that

00:02:37,349 --> 00:02:40,680
compounding factor where the more the

00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,299
stronger your community is the more

00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,650
members of your community there are the

00:02:42,299 --> 00:02:45,840
more they're talking about you the more

00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:47,459
they're influencing unaware prospects

00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,079
which turns into more where prospects

00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:52,290
and the cycle continues

00:02:49,079 --> 00:02:54,989
so what do we as marketers do any of us

00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:57,390
do in this turns out quite a lot we

00:02:54,989 --> 00:03:00,450
actually spend a lot of time influencing

00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:02,459
and directing this journey to start with

00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:04,109
we direct the brand I think that's super

00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:05,790
important we of course we're worrying

00:03:04,109 --> 00:03:07,709
about marketing strategy and positioning

00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:09,870
and messaging of course we're thinking

00:03:07,709 --> 00:03:12,060
about communications both externally and

00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:14,430
internally but we're also thinking and

00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:16,200
should be thinking hard about the

00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:18,299
culture of your company helping foster

00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:19,859
the culture and there's a really good

00:03:18,299 --> 00:03:23,819
reason for that and that is because

00:03:19,859 --> 00:03:25,590
brand and culture go hand and hand I can

00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:27,720
tell you from my experience when your

00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:30,090
brand and your culture are symbiotic

00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:31,950
when they're the same thing inside and

00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:34,200
outside boy that makes everything a lot

00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:35,790
easier it makes messaging a lot easier

00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:37,919
it makes matching to customers a lot

00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:39,840
easier it makes writing a lot easier it

00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:41,940
makes execution a lot easier because

00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:44,400
people have expectations from a culture

00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:46,319
that turnout to show up in the brand and

00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:49,290
in fact there's a great book by this

00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:51,419
author Denise Lyon who wrote a couple of

00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:52,949
books on branding and she wrote a quote

00:03:51,419 --> 00:03:55,019
it's quite lengthy here and she's saying

00:03:52,949 --> 00:03:57,060
that your culture and your brand cannot

00:03:55,019 --> 00:03:59,250
be separate they really can't if you

00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:00,720
don't have a mutually reinforcing

00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:02,459
relationship between those two things

00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,199
you're losing out on a lot of

00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:06,299
opportunity and frankly you're taking a

00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:08,489
lot of risk with your business the days

00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:09,720
when companies could present this brand

00:04:08,489 --> 00:04:11,430
to the outside world

00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:13,769
that was much different than the kind of

00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:15,900
culture they had internally that used to

00:04:13,769 --> 00:04:17,039
be pretty easy 20 30 years ago when

00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:18,870
there weren't so many channels of

00:04:17,039 --> 00:04:21,719
communication where people weren't as

00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:23,940
transparent with their sharing and with

00:04:21,719 --> 00:04:25,770
their points of view it's not possible

00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:26,620
anymore you're the world is too

00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:28,540
transparent you

00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:30,430
have to be authentic and I think Scott

00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:32,800
describes a need for authenticity and it

00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:35,889
certainly shows up that ran and culture

00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,720
must do that together now back to the

00:04:35,889 --> 00:04:40,570
journey the next stage is what we're

00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:42,280
doing to drive that move from a where

00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:43,840
prospect to customer in other words what

00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:45,820
are we doing to do revenue generation

00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,110
whether it's demand generation or

00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:50,139
working with sales on account based

00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:51,850
marketing or working to get leads in and

00:04:50,139 --> 00:04:54,310
get them in the funnel get them matured

00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:56,830
get them to become customers and make

00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:58,419
that experience accelerate that sales

00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:59,770
function I think Scott identified that

00:04:58,419 --> 00:05:01,660
that was one of the top things that

00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:04,300
boards are asking from their marketing

00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:06,039
as accelerate revenue and that's what we

00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:08,139
do and that phase the journey we help we

00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:10,600
work closely with sales on that funnel

00:05:08,139 --> 00:05:12,310
and we drive to revenue but that doesn't

00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:14,800
stop there getting revenue is not enough

00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:16,240
again in the world of subscription we

00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,070
have to work closely to make them

00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,260
successful we work closely with sales

00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:22,690
and customer success to ensure that

00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:24,610
customers can be successful at scale and

00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:26,590
so we're doing things like helping with

00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:28,330
customer engagement enable enablement in

00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:30,520
a lot of ways because of all the

00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:32,530
marketing technologies we have we're one

00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:34,750
of the better organizations in our

00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:37,479
companies that understands automation

00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:39,310
and that human nation humanization we're

00:05:37,479 --> 00:05:41,080
good at that sometimes you see where

00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:42,580
marketing understands where automation

00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:44,650
makes sense and where the personal touch

00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:47,620
makes sense and how you can put personal

00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:49,450
touches into your automation so we can

00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:51,789
make some major contributions in this

00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:54,099
area we also are really good at

00:05:51,789 --> 00:05:55,930
fostering connections we're good at

00:05:54,099 --> 00:05:57,340
staying on top of social we're good on

00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:58,539
staying on top of how the community is

00:05:57,340 --> 00:06:00,520
talking to each other and we're good at

00:05:58,539 --> 00:06:02,410
monitoring and and in enabling that

00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:04,510
community whether it's through a social

00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:06,610
presence or through events we're making

00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:08,349
the Community Connections happen and

00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:10,960
again all of this is a compounding

00:06:08,349 --> 00:06:13,300
factor to make growth possible the more

00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,949
you have satisfied customers the more

00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:16,000
they enter the community the more

00:06:14,949 --> 00:06:17,800
they're happy to be part of the

00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,810
community more they amplify your brand

00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:22,270
message which by amplifying your brand

00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:24,280
message gets you more unaware prospects

00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:26,889
to become aware prospects so it's really

00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:28,150
kind of a nice thing but I really want

00:06:26,889 --> 00:06:31,300
to talk a little bit more about what's

00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:33,580
underneath this cycle what drives this

00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:36,130
cycle forward what makes this cycle

00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:38,440
possible especially from our perspective

00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:40,300
as marketers in my opinion there are two

00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:42,940
things that really drive this

00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:45,160
cycle from phase two face what acts as

00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:47,320
the foundation to things that marketing

00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:50,320
is highly dependent upon are basically

00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:53,560
data enabling technology and content

00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:56,740
those are the two things the mastering

00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:58,630
what I call the virtuous cycle is highly

00:06:56,740 --> 00:07:00,730
dependent on these two things we live

00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:03,010
and die by our data enabling

00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:05,200
technologies and by the content we put

00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:07,810
through those data enabling technologies

00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:10,480
and you guys know that how important

00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:11,620
that is but why why in particular is it

00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:14,050
so important let's talk about data

00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:16,360
enabling technology um first of all and

00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:18,310
when I say data enabling technology what

00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:21,790
I mean by that is technology that not

00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:23,440
only delivers data and can keep track of

00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:25,150
what customers are doing and we can see

00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:27,070
what's happening that behavioral data

00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:29,710
and other types of data that we capture

00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:31,750
but also those technologies use that

00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:33,910
data to make themselves better and make

00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:35,230
themselves smarter a lot of AI and ml is

00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:36,910
doing that and the technologies you're

00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:39,630
using everyday that you don't even know

00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:42,010
you're using them so when I say data

00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:44,140
data enabling technology I mean it both

00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:45,900
ways I mean data that gets collected

00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:48,310
from the technologies but also

00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:50,320
technologies that rely on data and in

00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:52,060
that definition as Scott showed us I

00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:53,860
couldn't help but resist to show this I

00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:55,750
always show this because it's just a

00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:57,970
fact we're talking about a ridiculous

00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:59,950
number of applications and tools and

00:07:57,970 --> 00:08:01,960
api's and apps and services and

00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:04,540
microservices you call this the mark

00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:06,820
tech 5000 for convenience but I know you

00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:11,310
said it has seven over seven thousand

00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:13,540
boy it's just an incredible amount of

00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:16,480
complexity and technologies that we're

00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:17,980
facing and even though it shows that

00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:20,320
people use 5,000 and there's really

00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:21,730
7,000 most of us aren't even skimming

00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:24,370
the top of that I don't think there are

00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:26,500
very many organizations using 700 now

00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:28,030
certainly a lot of us are using 200 or

00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:31,030
even a hundred and I think you said the

00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:34,540
average was 91 but even small companies

00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:36,400
are using dozens and so it's really

00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:39,250
important that we are able to organize

00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:41,230
these data enabling technologies into

00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:43,330
our version of a platform or what we

00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:45,790
might commonly call the mark tech stack

00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:47,380
in fact when when we were just chatting

00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:49,750
Scott night before we were talking about

00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:51,940
whether the mark tech set of

00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:53,920
technologies is really a platform or not

00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:55,240
they're pretty loosely couple

00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:57,639
they're pretty loosely integrated

00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:59,230
sometimes not so great so I thought no

00:08:57,639 --> 00:09:01,329
it's not really a platform Scott's right

00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:03,220
it's really more of a stack but it's

00:09:01,329 --> 00:09:06,610
important because it's letting us do

00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:08,230
things that we could never do before the

00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:09,430
Marr tech stack is the foundation of

00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:11,290
everything you know whether it's the

00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:13,180
when we're collecting that data to the

00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:15,490
integration of it to the ability to

00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:16,810
store it and make sense of it to

00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:18,699
presenting it so we can orchestrate

00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:21,160
better marketing activities through the

00:09:18,699 --> 00:09:23,170
channels we need to be in to ultimately

00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:24,850
get to the customer this has completely

00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:27,190
changed our practices and our

00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:28,630
capabilities and the other thing that

00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:31,480
it's done is all this data handling

00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:33,880
technology has radically changed how we

00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:36,160
build brands demand and communities it's

00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:37,510
radically changed it 20 30 years ago

00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,130
before the internet you know you're

00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:41,649
pretty much placed print ads in

00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:43,990
magazines maybe some industry newspapers

00:09:41,649 --> 00:09:46,269
you went to some trade shows maybe you

00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:48,070
sent direct mail and you probably hired

00:09:46,269 --> 00:09:50,230
some appointment setting firms to call

00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:53,199
people and relentlessly call n annoy

00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:55,180
people but it's changed now it's all

00:09:53,199 --> 00:09:56,440
it's not how any of these brands did it

00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:57,940
and I bet you money most of your

00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:00,220
companies it's not how you built your

00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:02,260
brands either because what we're doing

00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:04,690
now is we're relying on technologies or

00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:06,399
capabilities now that then enable us to

00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:08,290
talk and get in front of prospects in

00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:10,120
different ways whether that's social

00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:12,670
media and the community the way that

00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:14,199
netflix has such passionate lovers of

00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:15,880
their original programming that you can

00:10:14,199 --> 00:10:18,430
you can connect to or whether it's

00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:20,260
digital ad channels that are happening

00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:22,209
things that people like Google of course

00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:24,640
with all we can do with Google Google

00:10:22,209 --> 00:10:27,010
but even Amazon has completely changed

00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:28,720
the way that people present themselves

00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:30,430
in digital advertising and now Amazon

00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:33,100
itself has become an advertising

00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:35,019
platform then it's incredible how people

00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:36,640
have taken experiences we're building

00:10:35,019 --> 00:10:38,620
experiences that move from online to

00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:40,300
offline pretty seamlessly uber is a

00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:42,220
great example no matter what you think

00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:43,720
about their brand they've given you a

00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:45,399
digital experience then you get an

00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:46,569
in-person experience that's also digital

00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:47,560
maybe while you're in the car and you

00:10:46,569 --> 00:10:49,390
get out of the car you're back to being

00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:51,550
an online experience a digital

00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:53,620
experience pretty seamless the Tesla

00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:55,510
buying experience is a lot like that as

00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:57,399
well and then of course these

00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:59,949
organizations our technology has enabled

00:10:57,399 --> 00:11:01,569
us to tell stories very differently the

00:10:59,949 --> 00:11:03,459
old days you you tried to hit up a

00:11:01,569 --> 00:11:04,720
meteorite er and you tried to convince

00:11:03,459 --> 00:11:06,940
them of your point of view and then they

00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,019
wrote a static article they printed it

00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:09,970
in offline media

00:11:08,019 --> 00:11:12,459
print or newspaper and that's pretty

00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:14,800
much how it happened but now we can tell

00:11:12,459 --> 00:11:16,509
stories not only do we go to journalists

00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,550
and have them tell very flexible and

00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:21,160
interesting stories we can tell our own

00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:23,439
stories we can become experts we can

00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:24,879
become journalists or the reporters of

00:11:23,439 --> 00:11:27,279
our own industry through brought

00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:29,230
blogging Twitter micro blogging what

00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:33,069
have you I think Scott and that's how

00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:34,869
Scott became recognized for his expert

00:11:33,069 --> 00:11:36,639
and authenticity in that areas he really

00:11:34,869 --> 00:11:39,249
started thinking and sharing his

00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:41,049
knowledge as a practitioner and so we

00:11:39,249 --> 00:11:43,540
are able to do that it's an amazing

00:11:41,049 --> 00:11:46,299
thing tableau has done a great job I

00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:47,799
think using data helping people use data

00:11:46,299 --> 00:11:50,019
to tell stories with the free product

00:11:47,799 --> 00:11:51,999
called tableau a public is a new way

00:11:50,019 --> 00:11:53,799
ordinary people can tell stories with

00:11:51,999 --> 00:11:55,360
data and then all of them are using

00:11:53,799 --> 00:11:57,309
direct communications but not just

00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,019
direct mail old-fashioned and not even

00:11:57,309 --> 00:12:01,149
email which is old-fashioned but still

00:11:59,019 --> 00:12:02,589
effective there's text there's Instagram

00:12:01,149 --> 00:12:06,579
there's slack there's drift there's all

00:12:02,589 --> 00:12:08,529
kinds of all kinds of new kinds of data

00:12:06,579 --> 00:12:10,660
enabled technologies even the phone is a

00:12:08,529 --> 00:12:12,790
much different experience than it was

00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:14,410
even 20 or 30 years ago and you know

00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:16,029
what we don't have to go that far to see

00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:18,850
an example of how the mark tech stack

00:12:16,029 --> 00:12:21,999
works here's an example of how tableau

00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:24,779
used I think over 15 different marketing

00:12:21,999 --> 00:12:27,339
technologies to improve their use of

00:12:24,779 --> 00:12:29,649
customer records and cognitive scoring

00:12:27,339 --> 00:12:31,569
in admitting and what did it resume is a

00:12:29,649 --> 00:12:33,220
lot of Technology a lot of integrations

00:12:31,569 --> 00:12:34,779
we needed our developers to work on this

00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:35,920
we needed our content people to do this

00:12:34,779 --> 00:12:37,540
because the ads mattered

00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:39,069
we needed our campaign managers we

00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:40,839
needed sales we needed all these peoples

00:12:39,069 --> 00:12:42,939
and all these systems and all this data

00:12:40,839 --> 00:12:45,339
to come together and what did it result

00:12:42,939 --> 00:12:47,980
in it resulted in 16% more leads for the

00:12:45,339 --> 00:12:49,569
same cost now as a CMO I mean I'm not

00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:51,999
always thinking about how to how to

00:12:49,569 --> 00:12:53,860
increase efficiency on spend but it is a

00:12:51,999 --> 00:12:55,929
huge objective you get a lot of pressure

00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:58,240
from above to make sure your budgets are

00:12:55,929 --> 00:12:59,529
effective that your most efficient way

00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,629
that you can attract customers and

00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:03,999
prospects and I actually like to see it

00:13:01,629 --> 00:13:05,709
when we can save money or do more with

00:13:03,999 --> 00:13:06,970
the same money because guess what that

00:13:05,709 --> 00:13:09,639
means we can do more with other things

00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:11,589
too and I love to see us expanding and

00:13:09,639 --> 00:13:13,059
experimenting it's pretty awesome to be

00:13:11,589 --> 00:13:15,149
able to do this and they did it this

00:13:13,059 --> 00:13:17,249
team did it at scale they did it for

00:13:15,149 --> 00:13:19,000
250,000 keywords

00:13:17,249 --> 00:13:21,220
47,000 different ads

00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,230
and nearly seven billion monthly

00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:25,600
impressions which was a lot of data a

00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:29,319
lot of associated technologies that made

00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:31,750
it possible from our mark tech stack but

00:13:29,319 --> 00:13:33,879
even with so even with that one example

00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:35,620
of tableau there you can see that this

00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:36,850
news this statement from The Economist

00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:39,189
about a year and a half ago or almost

00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:41,889
two years ago the world's most valuable

00:13:39,189 --> 00:13:43,240
resources no longer oil but data and I'm

00:13:41,889 --> 00:13:45,699
sure you've heard it and it's almost

00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:48,759
become trite already but the fact is

00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:50,439
it's true because data reflects behavior

00:13:48,759 --> 00:13:51,759
if data can reflect the behavior were

00:13:50,439 --> 00:13:54,670
experienced in the online and offline

00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:57,040
world then we can model reality and we

00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:59,649
can understand better how to project our

00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:01,420
own offers to the market into customers

00:13:59,649 --> 00:14:04,600
to find the best customers and prospects

00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:06,310
to join in and to our franchise so it's

00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:08,050
great that the way that data is the new

00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:10,209
most valuable resource but there's a bit

00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:12,910
of a problem and that is that being

00:14:10,209 --> 00:14:15,310
data-driven ask God also indicated still

00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:17,050
eludes a lot of organizations how many

00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:19,689
of you would say that your organization

00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:22,000
is data-driven or fairly close to being

00:14:19,689 --> 00:14:23,470
data-driven how about oh good ok good

00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,319
and how many of you're saying we're just

00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:27,490
on the beginning of that journey ok good

00:14:26,319 --> 00:14:28,990
and how many people say you know what

00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:31,000
haven't heard much about it not not

00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:32,259
really company management's not talking

00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,329
about it ok so there are so you know

00:14:32,259 --> 00:14:36,519
it's different kinds of phases you go

00:14:34,329 --> 00:14:39,339
through so nearly everyone in this

00:14:36,519 --> 00:14:41,230
particular survey of executives about

00:14:39,339 --> 00:14:43,930
data about big data in particular said

00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:45,699
they're trying but nearly 2/3 admitted

00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:48,309
they're nowhere baked close to being

00:14:45,699 --> 00:14:50,500
successful so here you guys are many of

00:14:48,309 --> 00:14:52,480
you with the skills and the smarts to

00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:54,370
understand the value of data but as you

00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,600
know the problem is there aren't enough

00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:59,199
people like you

00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:02,230
95% of employers say finding people with

00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:04,480
analytical skills is hard that's pretty

00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:06,579
incredible just barely under cyber

00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,290
security and you know how important that

00:15:06,579 --> 00:15:10,930
is in these days so it's pretty

00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:13,000
remarkable how the need for skills with

00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:15,279
using data and using technology data

00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:19,120
enabling technologies has never been

00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:21,040
higher now why is content important it's

00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,660
right there with data enabling

00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:25,059
technology in my mind it said the other

00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:27,550
invisible force shaping what our

00:15:25,059 --> 00:15:29,769
marketing efforts can do today and it's

00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:31,750
there's a huge imperative and so again

00:15:29,769 --> 00:15:32,470
why is it so important well it's really

00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:34,900
quite simple

00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:36,370
because it's important to buyers it's

00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:39,940
important to your customers

00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:41,530
60% of b2b buyers don't want to interact

00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:44,830
with a sales rep I think I got this from

00:15:41,530 --> 00:15:46,810
a Gartner survey by the way and 62% say

00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:49,480
they can finalize their purchase

00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:51,550
selection criteria based solely on

00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:53,530
digital content Wow

00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:55,960
that is a pretty remarkable thing that

00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:57,610
means that a lot of our relationships

00:15:55,960 --> 00:16:00,310
with our customers are starting and

00:15:57,610 --> 00:16:02,740
pretty much fully formed by the digital

00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:04,480
content that we're producing and we're

00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:05,530
delivering in an effective way that's

00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:07,300
pretty amazing

00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:09,730
one of the problems though with the

00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:11,680
industry is with content is that a lot

00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:13,210
of content is crap and I will say that

00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,470
freely because I think Scott also said

00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:15,850
that word crap

00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:17,710
and it's just it's you know it's really

00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:19,540
a question of you know so much the

00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:21,700
material being useless and nearly 60

00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:24,280
percent thought that it is a 20-18

00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:25,780
survey too much material so people can't

00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:27,730
find really what would help them at the

00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:30,280
time and they use a lot of other sources

00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:32,290
so it's you know it's it's it's a

00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:35,290
well-known fact but and we just got to

00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:36,850
keep working on what it is and so what

00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:38,380
they're some of the keys to successful

00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:40,120
content marketing well I don't propose

00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:43,150
to have all the answers but I do love

00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:46,780
this philosophy which is stop thinking

00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:49,480
of content as a campaign asset and to

00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:51,040
sell start thinking it as a means to

00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:53,980
start and maintain business

00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:55,870
relationships with buyers so think about

00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:58,540
it not as oh I need a piece to be able

00:16:55,870 --> 00:17:00,190
to generate a lead no we need to talk to

00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:02,410
our buyers and our prospects about

00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:04,570
important issues and let's start a

00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:06,310
relationship with this content and I

00:17:04,570 --> 00:17:09,040
think if you take it a higher level to

00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:10,690
less of a campaign tactic to a strategic

00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:12,370
function it gives you a different

00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:15,400
perspective on it and I think that will

00:17:12,370 --> 00:17:17,440
increase the value of our content to our

00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:21,700
buyers and to our customers as they

00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:24,250
travel their journey with you and I love

00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:26,590
this quote from La Ramos of Forrester

00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:28,270
who said what you have to say is more

00:17:26,590 --> 00:17:30,490
important than what channel or tactic

00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:32,680
you used to say it again thinking about

00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:35,440
what you're having to say as a strategic

00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:38,170
decision or a strategic input and of

00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:39,820
course the the tactical element of

00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:41,380
putting it out there is still extremely

00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:44,110
critical so I don't want to

00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:45,850
underestimate what you have to do to get

00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:46,240
it in the right channel to get it to

00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:47,860
your tour

00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:50,260
segment because you do have to choose

00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:51,580
your channels wisely and you can you can

00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:53,260
create a lot of content and great

00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:54,880
content and just put it on your website

00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:57,250
and hope that hey if I build it they

00:17:54,880 --> 00:18:00,040
will come we all know that's just not

00:17:57,250 --> 00:18:03,160
true they won't come sometimes but very

00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:05,800
rarely so give it all that sort of

00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:07,750
context going back to the idea that what

00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:10,090
are some ideas or lessons things that I

00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:13,170
learned about how you can drive growth

00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:16,030
well got forth them for you first one is

00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:19,360
evangelize relentlessly be somebody who

00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:22,059
is even if you're not a technologist

00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:23,740
relentlessly invent and evangelize new

00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:25,900
data enabling technologies to keep

00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:26,410
improving because they are just coming

00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:28,750
at us

00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:30,580
superfast now I'm not saying cause

00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:32,170
stress in your organization oh my god

00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:33,610
we're still on this old system we need

00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:35,380
to do something odd you don't have to

00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:37,210
create stress well you have to do is get

00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:39,130
people excited about the possibilities

00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:40,780
Scott and I were talking before and I

00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:43,830
was recalling how when I started at

00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:48,059
tableau in 2007 there weren't that many

00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:50,590
data technologies at all there was Ella

00:18:48,059 --> 00:18:52,059
quarries a'no below or dove reasonable

00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:53,260
and then there was Marketo which had a

00:18:52,059 --> 00:18:55,540
little bit of something but a lot of

00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:57,070
stuff on paper at the time we were

00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:58,630
trying to figure out which content

00:18:57,070 --> 00:19:00,520
management system we use I think our

00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:03,100
decision was between Drupal and Joomla

00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:06,309
as I recall and it was just a very

00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:08,110
different world but we have sense but it

00:19:06,309 --> 00:19:10,570
developed and the companies since

00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:12,280
adopted many many technologies because

00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:14,020
there's excitement about being able to

00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:15,940
do more stuff and more interesting stuff

00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:18,309
so helping your organization have a

00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:20,620
positive attitude toward growth keeping

00:19:18,309 --> 00:19:22,720
an open mindset about growth about

00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:24,400
technologies is very positive things you

00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,840
can do now sometimes you might get

00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:28,120
frustrated with your leaders with your

00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:29,470
CMO or your heads because it seems like

00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:31,420
they're not listening or not going fast

00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:32,770
enough just be a little empathetic

00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:34,450
because they're trying to fight the good

00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:36,160
fight and it takes a lot the larger

00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:38,650
organization is the more you need some

00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:39,940
governance from IT and integration with

00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:42,100
a bunch of other apps that you don't

00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:43,390
even know the companies using they need

00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:46,000
your positive thoughts and positive

00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:49,570
energy and enthusiasm for new ways to

00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:51,309
get things done in fact there are some

00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:53,020
technology forces that I think are

00:19:51,309 --> 00:19:54,550
really driving marketing and impacting

00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:56,140
marketing that we have to manage against

00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:58,419
they're the very new ones like digital

00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:59,340
reality but also the cognitive

00:19:58,419 --> 00:20:02,160
technologies like

00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:04,890
I hear read or see another five articles

00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:07,650
about AI or ml and my email box today I

00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:09,750
would be shocked if it wasn't even ten

00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:12,030
it's just a big hot trend right

00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:13,440
same with blockchain you know blockchain

00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:14,910
there's still the emerging trend that

00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:17,040
that's gonna impact marketing in a big

00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:18,450
way and first I thought really how and

00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:20,610
then you start to read about anyone home

00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:21,810
this could be pretty huge of course

00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:24,090
we're still talking about some of the

00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:27,030
old new the old new which are things

00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:28,980
like digital experiences and analytics

00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:30,900
still people are talking about analytics

00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:32,640
and still talking about the going to the

00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:34,770
cloud these are still important things

00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:37,010
now when you turn inward there are many

00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:39,750
issues to the business realities

00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:42,150
modernizing our core systems to enable

00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:44,280
us to adopt new technologies to enable

00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:46,890
us to be smarter with technology is

00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:48,720
non-trivial as a non trivial activity

00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:50,430
and it requires really amazing engineers

00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:52,680
and amazing amazing developers and

00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:53,670
amazing marketing technologists so if

00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:55,710
you have those people in your

00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:56,940
organization grab onto them and hold

00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:59,160
onto them because they're valuable

00:20:56,940 --> 00:21:00,750
because that's a critical thing also

00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:03,240
what are we gonna do about risk and

00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:05,220
cybersecurity this is non-trivial you're

00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:07,140
just a day or two away from some kind of

00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:08,790
catastrophic event according to what you

00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:11,160
read in the media something that's got

00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:12,690
to be managed and then finally you know

00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:14,370
if it's true what Gartner says Gartner

00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:16,800
says the CMO is gonna spend more than

00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:19,020
the CIO buy I think it's next year if

00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:21,240
that's true then a lot of technology

00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:22,500
resting in the IT organization might not

00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:25,440
be the best place for it if we're

00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:27,480
spending or or if so it better be a

00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:29,550
strong collaboration between marketing

00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:32,100
and IT about how things get executed and

00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:35,670
the priority of how the need for

00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:37,230
marketing technologies gets set so we

00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:38,850
all need to be able to be patient with

00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:41,040
these trends and understand them to be

00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:43,620
able to help our organization make smart

00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:45,810
decisions so my recommendations are just

00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:47,460
keep learning keep listening I love some

00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:49,530
of Scott's recommendations have you

00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:51,030
heard of this one's FBA and other ones

00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:52,170
that you mentioned to air table I've

00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:54,120
heard of those and but now I'm Rhian

00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:56,250
spired to go back to my office and look

00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:57,750
them up you know you're here at this

00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:59,580
conference so obviously you're a learner

00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:01,860
and always being a lifelong learner is a

00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:03,150
good thing and I'm going to ask you even

00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:04,740
though if you're a Content person or an

00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:06,960
agency don't think of yourself as

00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:08,040
somebody who just delivers in response

00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,590
to it but think of yourself as an

00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:12,179
innovator you're smart you're on top of

00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:13,679
issues you're on top of trends what can

00:22:12,179 --> 00:22:17,399
you to help do to help your organization

00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:19,980
innovate your ideas are critical okay

00:22:17,399 --> 00:22:22,409
idea number to encourage data use and

00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:24,809
champion new data sources we want to be

00:22:22,409 --> 00:22:27,360
able to use more data marketers are in

00:22:24,809 --> 00:22:29,279
fact wanna you can learn a lot even from

00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,720
just basic data so one of the things I

00:22:29,279 --> 00:22:32,700
hear constantly is like oh we don't have

00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,200
all our data perfectly integrated yet or

00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:36,210
we don't have it all in a data warehouse

00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:37,710
or a cloud warehouse so we're not doing

00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:39,690
anything oh my gosh that's that's

00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:41,940
unfortunate because you know even though

00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:44,220
we think that we might think like we

00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:46,139
want all the data we want a 360-degree

00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:47,879
view and sometimes we question when we

00:22:46,139 --> 00:22:49,710
don't have the full view and sometimes

00:22:47,879 --> 00:22:51,090
we think buy the data we don't have is

00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:53,129
more important than the data we do have

00:22:51,090 --> 00:22:55,019
the fact is people just need to get

00:22:53,129 --> 00:22:57,600
started and I love this quote from

00:22:55,019 --> 00:23:00,749
Charles Babbage a mathematician from

00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:02,639
like the 1800s or something he said and

00:23:00,749 --> 00:23:04,499
I find this to be true time and time

00:23:02,639 --> 00:23:06,480
again errors using inaccurate data are

00:23:04,499 --> 00:23:09,059
much less than those using no data at

00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:11,159
all okay so I'd rather make a smaller

00:23:09,059 --> 00:23:12,119
error than a bigger error okay just

00:23:11,159 --> 00:23:13,499
because I don't have all the data it

00:23:12,119 --> 00:23:15,769
doesn't mean I can't get a good answer

00:23:13,499 --> 00:23:18,450
or get some good direction or insight

00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:20,220
here's a good example real simple this

00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:22,529
is just data from our website out of

00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:24,600
Drupal or from our web logs and it's

00:23:22,529 --> 00:23:26,519
telling me that hey those Germans in

00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:28,679
German language content really love more

00:23:26,519 --> 00:23:30,629
than other languages or mother or other

00:23:28,679 --> 00:23:32,700
language groups they love to click on

00:23:30,629 --> 00:23:34,590
data visualizations and graphics less so

00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:36,779
on white papers hey that's informative

00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:37,889
if I'm marketing to to the German market

00:23:36,779 --> 00:23:39,090
and putting it in German all right I

00:23:37,889 --> 00:23:40,860
learned something today I'm a Content

00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:43,320
marketer I can be smarter about what's

00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:44,820
gonna be effective all right some quick

00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:46,980
recommendations encourage people to

00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:49,080
analyze and use data including yourself

00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:50,759
don't be afraid you know ask to

00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:52,139
understand the data flows especially as

00:23:50,759 --> 00:23:53,429
it relates to content because you want

00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:55,169
to understand which of your content is

00:23:53,429 --> 00:23:57,269
the best performing so you can create

00:23:55,169 --> 00:23:58,799
more like it and then get to know other

00:23:57,269 --> 00:24:00,059
groups because they have data and they

00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:00,470
have know-how that you can share with

00:24:00,059 --> 00:24:04,049
them

00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:05,850
third really important because the brand

00:24:04,049 --> 00:24:08,070
is so important to the customer journey

00:24:05,850 --> 00:24:10,230
into the virtuous cycle every touch is a

00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:12,179
brand touch and most touches are digital

00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:14,340
let's face it these are all kinda these

00:24:12,179 --> 00:24:16,169
are a long list of outbound and outbound

00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:18,330
activities you can do and I've bolded

00:24:16,169 --> 00:24:20,340
things that are fairly digital online

00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:22,379
but even things that are offline at

00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:24,179
in-person events and conferences and

00:24:22,379 --> 00:24:25,500
trade shows boy you can make those

00:24:24,179 --> 00:24:28,679
pretty effective

00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:30,690
by using smart digital technologies to

00:24:28,679 --> 00:24:32,370
make those experiences smarter and

00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:34,350
better whether it's a mobile app at a

00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:35,880
conference or when they get back to the

00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:38,039
office after a conference they're doing

00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:41,070
smart stuff there that's a great thing

00:24:38,039 --> 00:24:42,809
so let me just speed up a little bit so

00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:44,730
my recommendations are that you show you

00:24:42,809 --> 00:24:46,620
care about the brand and show that that

00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:49,260
you care about the customer experience

00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:51,090
I love Scott's idea that CX has its own

00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:54,600
ROI and it really does

00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:57,150
Lucroy aside as CX does have its own ROI

00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:58,830
so come to your job whatever it is you

00:24:57,150 --> 00:25:00,809
do with that idea from a customer

00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:01,890
mindset and if that means getting out of

00:25:00,809 --> 00:25:04,080
your office and talking to some

00:25:01,890 --> 00:25:05,640
customers my gosh do it or you run into

00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:07,980
someone at a conference who says hey I

00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:09,690
use your product talk to them you he or

00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:11,370
she who speaks with the voice of the

00:25:09,690 --> 00:25:13,260
customer is going to have the most

00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:15,630
credibility and a meeting and so be that

00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:19,110
person who's credible we need you to do

00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:20,429
that and then finally it doesn't matter

00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:23,190
if you have people reporting to you or

00:25:20,429 --> 00:25:25,080
not be a leader empower your company's

00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:26,970
most valuable assets be a culture

00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:29,250
builder when you're a culture builder

00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:30,929
you're a brand builder and that is going

00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:33,270
to be a very valuable thing to the

00:25:30,929 --> 00:25:35,130
virtuous cycle as we already saw in the

00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:36,690
other huge benefit is that if you're a

00:25:35,130 --> 00:25:38,700
culture builder and you're attracting

00:25:36,690 --> 00:25:40,470
great people into your team great people

00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:42,390
around you it will help you accomplish

00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:44,429
the difficult path of growth because

00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:47,700
people really are the differentiating

00:25:44,429 --> 00:25:49,230
factor in fact I love this if you must

00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:51,240
choose between a great plan with a

00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:51,809
mediocre team or a mediocre plan with a

00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:54,059
great team

00:25:51,809 --> 00:25:56,309
take the great team every time because a

00:25:54,059 --> 00:25:58,710
great team will fix a bad plan a

00:25:56,309 --> 00:26:01,620
mediocre team hmm probably can't even

00:25:58,710 --> 00:26:03,090
execute a great plan the thing is and

00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:04,890
don't underestimate this a lot of

00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:06,809
mediocre teams are actually great teams

00:26:04,890 --> 00:26:09,360
in hiding they just need someone to come

00:26:06,809 --> 00:26:12,299
in and show them the way and you can be

00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:14,159
the person that has that enthusiasm for

00:26:12,299 --> 00:26:17,250
wanting to do great work and that can

00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:18,990
drive a team to excellence ok so my

00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:21,360
recommendations are look for fit in your

00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:23,100
job is you coming in and do it and

00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,870
feeling like you love your job now you

00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:26,400
don't have to love it 100% of every day

00:26:24,870 --> 00:26:28,500
in fact I just read an article this

00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:30,510
morning that says if you love the things

00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:32,580
you're doing a job at least 20% of the

00:26:30,510 --> 00:26:34,440
day that's enough in fact there's really

00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:36,750
no difference if you love your job 20%

00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:38,370
of the day or 50% of the day 20% of the

00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:40,980
day if the things you're doing

00:26:38,370 --> 00:26:42,419
are you love doing then you should be

00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:44,460
doing then you're in a place that fits

00:26:42,419 --> 00:26:46,019
if you're not maybe find a place where

00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:48,149
you can be part of the culture builder

00:26:46,019 --> 00:26:49,980
and you can feel like more of a fit be

00:26:48,149 --> 00:26:51,990
an example of that culture as well and

00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:53,639
then lead you can lead by enabling and

00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:55,740
innovating no matter what your role is

00:26:53,639 --> 00:26:57,179
it's not about managing people as I said

00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:58,559
it's about leadership and people are

00:26:57,179 --> 00:27:00,750
looking for leaders you can be that

00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:02,700
leader okay so remember that secret

00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:04,950
formula it's real simple great brands

00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:06,600
attract prospects satisfied prospects

00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:08,100
become customers happy customers lead to

00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:09,539
community and strong communities amplify

00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:11,429
great brands it's doable

00:27:09,539 --> 00:27:12,960
it really is now you can borrow it and

00:27:11,429 --> 00:27:15,480
adjust it and change it and make it

00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:17,549
better to work for your world I found

00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:19,259
that this worked for me and tableau as

00:27:17,549 --> 00:27:20,940
we grew to a billion and you know

00:27:19,259 --> 00:27:22,169
frankly this formula at night might not

00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:24,330
work for them for the next five billion

00:27:22,169 --> 00:27:26,220
but it took us to a pretty good journey

00:27:24,330 --> 00:27:28,860
at this point but the real the real

00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:31,470
thing is that content data enabling

00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:34,080
technology and people are what underlie

00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:36,690
this all and this is really what the key

00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:38,850
point is content and data technologies

00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:40,710
are enabling us to do anything and each

00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:42,389
of us with our colleagues is really the

00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:44,190
one we are really the ones making it

00:27:42,389 --> 00:27:46,740
happen so and that's not just for today

00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:49,620
but for every day so it's our moment

00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:51,389
it's your moment seize it so I want to

00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:54,029
thank you so much for having me speak

00:27:51,389 --> 00:27:56,000
and like Scott I'll be down here and I

00:27:54,029 --> 00:28:02,150
hope you enjoyed it thanks so much

00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:02,150
