Title: DrupalCon Seattle 2019: Personalization for the Perplexed
Publication date: 2019-04-11
Playlist: Drupalcon Seattle 2019
Description: 
	If you create or manage content for the web, you've heard the buzz around personalization. Content marketers, enthusiastic CEOs, and thirsty vendors all seem to agree that visitor-tailored content is the future, but the reality on the ground rarely lives up to the promise of well-polished demos.

In this talk, we'll step back and study four building blocks of tailored content — the foundation your organization needs before launching a bold new initiative or purchasing a cutting-edge product. Along the way, you'll learn how to save your sanity when the inevitable feature request arrives…

You'll walk away from this talk with:

A clear understanding of personalization's core building blocks — and how to prepare your organization for them
A map of common pitfalls and how to sidestep them
A sane, actionable response to your boss's great new personalization brainstorm

welcome to personalization for the

00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:06,750
perplexed wow I feel like I'm I did like

00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:12,000
an NPR hosting voice that was really

00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:14,639
weird so quick show of hands before we

00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,750
get started who here has done

00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:19,350
personalization

00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:21,289
on a website who here has been told they

00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:24,269
need to do personalization on a website

00:00:21,289 --> 00:00:25,890
who here feels like the person who told

00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:27,599
them to do personalization on the

00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:29,939
website knew what they met when they

00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:32,250
said you need to do personalization on

00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:32,579
the website okay yeah that sounds about

00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:38,210
right

00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:40,469
hi so I'm Jeff Eaton I work for a

00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:42,930
strategy design and development company

00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:46,469
called lullaby we do big content

00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:48,000
websites primarily with Drupal and we

00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:53,270
work with most of the clients that we

00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:56,730
work with our large publishing or like

00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:58,170
education or support orgs the common

00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:01,440
pattern that we tend to find is that

00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:04,439
they create and publish content online

00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:07,950
as like a core part of their mission not

00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:10,229
just like a marketing adjunct to you

00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:11,670
know the real stuff that they do we do

00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:13,140
work with some marketing orgs but like

00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:14,790
that's the that's the meat of what we do

00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:17,759
so a lot of the stuff I'm going to be

00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:21,630
talking about is shaped by that

00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:23,880
perspective so if you feel like I'm

00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:25,650
completely full of it or you want to

00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:30,079
argue feel free to take it to Twitter

00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:33,540
where I have always loved being heckled

00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:37,020
so before we start with my little

00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:41,159
wiggling meta slide I'm gonna step back

00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:43,170
and give sort of an idea of what I'm

00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:45,990
talking about when I talk about content

00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:47,970
personalization so this is a rough

00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:55,439
flowchart of the presentation you are

00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:57,240
about to witness you are here and in in

00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:59,790
you know like a standard content

00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:01,860
publishing scenario this is this might

00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:03,630
be like basically where you want people

00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:05,549
to go through the site hierarchy or

00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:07,110
something like that and there may be

00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:08,700
goals that I have and giving this

00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:12,120
presentation there's stuff you want out

00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:13,100
of it but ultimately because this is a

00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,140
fixed

00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:18,200
linear timeframe not some sort of like

00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:19,580
weird quantum universe where everything

00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:22,640
is branching out into a million

00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:25,010
directions we have to choose one fixed

00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:28,250
set of stuff to go through for this talk

00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:32,690
wouldn't it be awesome wouldn't it be

00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:35,170
fantastic if we could just have an

00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:38,840
infinite number of presentations already

00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:40,070
you know four already and the

00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:42,050
conversation we're about to have

00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:43,490
together was just one of many paths and

00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:45,460
for each person in the room I could

00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:48,800
branch off in a different direction and

00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:51,380
give something perfectly tailored to

00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,480
what they care about the world would

00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:55,640
just be wonderful and we'd be swimming

00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:57,410
in bags of money and we'd be does

00:02:55,640 --> 00:03:00,560
anybody remember ducktales the cartoon

00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:03,470
yeah that's Scrooge McDuck in his giant

00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:05,030
vault full of Surfing money and that's

00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:07,460
sort of the dream of content

00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:09,070
personalization giant huge bags of money

00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:12,650
because you're able to customize

00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:14,870
everything you published well perfectly

00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:16,730
to the person who's reading it and

00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:18,380
deliver just what they want and just

00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:20,840
what will incentivize them to write a

00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:22,610
giant check to your organization and

00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:25,580
that brings us to the gist of this

00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:28,180
person was a personalization talk Karen

00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:32,480
McGrane who has written a lot on

00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:34,340
structured content and I a and UX s and

00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,050
more recently about content

00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:38,120
personalization one of the quotes for

00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:41,000
her that I love is that most per content

00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:44,870
personalization talks are fanfiction for

00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:48,560
CMOS they are basically about the

00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:51,260
fantasy that a marketing executive has

00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:54,230
of how wonderful the world beat would be

00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:56,300
if we could perfectly tailor everything

00:03:54,230 --> 00:04:00,740
to everyone and then just ski down the

00:03:56,300 --> 00:04:02,660
pile of money the results the problem is

00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:04,490
this personalization is really tangley

00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:06,730
and complicated not just from a

00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:09,440
technical perspective but from an

00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:11,360
organizational perspective because there

00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:14,510
is a lot of work that goes into it

00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:17,090
because not only are you generating a

00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:19,609
webpage or creating a particular piece

00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:21,380
of content you're managing all of the

00:04:19,609 --> 00:04:23,600
different permutations of all of the

00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:27,040
different bits that go into that and

00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:29,440
keeping track of not only that content

00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:32,800
but the scenarios in which you want to

00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:35,440
tailor things it's complicated and a lot

00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:38,800
of the conversations we have focus not

00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:40,930
on the work not on understanding the

00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,210
decisions you're making but on the

00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:46,120
features of the products that will

00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:48,400
eventually get selected to generate the

00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:51,100
webpage or to swap out a different CTA

00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:53,470
or to track the metrics or whatever so

00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:55,300
this is a talk that is not going to

00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:57,010
mention any particular products it is

00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:59,830
not going to talk about technical

00:04:57,010 --> 00:05:03,150
implementation deal details at all it's

00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:07,240
just a step back and an attempt to frame

00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:09,700
what we have to figure out as an

00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:12,610
organization in order to do content

00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:14,320
personalization effectively the basic

00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:16,020
framework that I tend to use when

00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:19,510
talking to clients about this stuff is

00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:21,940
three parts signals which is basically

00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:24,550
the individual little bits of data that

00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:26,290
we can capture and collect and the

00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:28,330
things that we know about what's going

00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:31,090
on when someone is interacting with our

00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:33,670
content scenarios which is sort of the

00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:36,550
the stories that we come up with about

00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:38,290
what's going on based on those

00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:39,880
individual signals things like

00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:42,670
somebody's checking news somebody is

00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:45,190
physically located near an airport I'm

00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:47,440
going to imagine that they're a traveler

00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:50,560
so we're going to make content that's

00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:52,510
for travelers and deliver it to them now

00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,400
the signal is actually relatively simple

00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:56,410
it's just there near an airport we're

00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:59,560
telling a story to ourselves about what

00:05:56,410 --> 00:06:03,250
that means and then reactions the third

00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:05,350
part are assuming that we're talking to

00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:07,600
a person who is a traveler what do we

00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:09,520
want to do differently with our content

00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,080
in order to reach them so that those

00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,610
sort of three building blocks are what

00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:15,220
we're going to be looking at the first

00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:17,830
one signals again it's basically what

00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:19,330
you know about the current situation in

00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:23,020
which someone is consuming your content

00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:24,970
I tend to look at this as in a couple of

00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:28,030
different ways one is pure contextual

00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:31,630
stuff things that if someone hits your

00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:33,790
website or they you know they're using

00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:36,419
an app that you feed content into or

00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:39,160
something like that stuff that you know

00:06:36,419 --> 00:06:40,630
based on the devices that they're using

00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:42,670
that could be the

00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:44,920
geographical location that they're

00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:47,080
currently at on if they're on a cell

00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:49,480
phone or something like that the time of

00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:52,120
day in their current time zone if

00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:55,240
they're hitting a web application you

00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:58,990
know what specific URL they requested

00:06:55,240 --> 00:07:01,030
and sometimes what URL they came from in

00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:03,550
order to get there so you can start

00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:07,870
piecing together certains like stories

00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:11,110
purely based on context but these things

00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:12,820
are they're very assumption heavy

00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:15,490
because they're sort of free-floating

00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:18,070
you don't really know too much you just

00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:21,490
extrapolate from oh it's 10:00 a.m.

00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:22,540
there in Phoenix they're looking at our

00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:25,480
support page

00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:27,010
what can we guess about that but some of

00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:28,510
these contextual signals signals are

00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:30,820
like the raw building blocks that you

00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:34,510
can assemble into bigger assumptions

00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:35,920
later the other one the other category

00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:39,640
of stuff that we tend to look at is

00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:42,700
behavior like what are they doing

00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:45,010
and this isn't necessarily assumptions

00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:47,560
about what they think they will do its

00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:49,600
what actions are they actually taking

00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:51,640
and that could be we know the particular

00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:53,980
path that they've taken through the

00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:56,470
website over the past five minutes it

00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:58,630
could be in the case of like Amazon or

00:07:56,470 --> 00:08:00,040
whatever it could be we know the

00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:02,410
different products they've already

00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:05,020
looked at on this visit to the website

00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:07,840
so we can start feeding that back into

00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:10,450
what the next round of products in the

00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:13,960
rotator will be for them it's based on

00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:17,380
the behavior of the person in their

00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:19,750
current interaction with us the next

00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:21,960
step is basically like user profiles and

00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:25,120
larger archives of information we gather

00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:27,570
across visits and across interactions

00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:30,100
with them the easiest way to do this

00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:32,380
technically speaking is like you know

00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:36,250
the the Netflix approach tell us who you

00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:38,080
are tell us when you log in I am you

00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:41,289
know this is my wife my wife my own

00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:42,460
Netflix account I say I'm Jeff you know

00:08:41,289 --> 00:08:45,010
what I've done previously

00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:47,230
since I'm telling you who I am you can

00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:49,270
base what you present to me based on you

00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:51,270
know what I've done before what I've

00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:53,770
said I'm interested in stuff like that

00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:54,430
probably the easiest way to find out

00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:57,310
what people

00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:59,320
is to explicitly ask them and then give

00:08:57,310 --> 00:09:02,620
it to them and profiles are a convenient

00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:05,740
way of doing this but depending on the

00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:08,830
scenarios you're in profiles might be

00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:10,660
something that you you do without

00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:12,520
explicitly like setting up an account

00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:14,320
for them to log onto the website it

00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:16,600
might be just like an identifier that

00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,880
you use to say we know this person's

00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:20,710
visited us before we may not know their

00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:22,600
name we may not know their email address

00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:24,610
but we know the kinds of things they

00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:26,610
keep coming back for so we'll keep track

00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:29,320
of that that idea of like an ongoing

00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:32,590
archive of what someone looks for and

00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:35,110
what they request and then there's also

00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:38,230
the whole idea of like there's a whole

00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:42,940
ecosystem of third party data providers

00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:46,210
that can match you up with huge swathes

00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:47,800
of signal data about the people who are

00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:50,620
visiting your website or the people who

00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:54,700
are consuming your content so if you

00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:58,270
want to say target content to people who

00:09:54,700 --> 00:10:00,370
are between 30 and 40 and married and

00:09:58,270 --> 00:10:02,130
have two children and live in Phoenix

00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:04,690
and all you have is an email address

00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:09,940
there are services that can get you

00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:12,790
there but it is not necessarily a simple

00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:14,470
prospect because there's a lot of data

00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:18,190
privacy stuff that goes along with that

00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:20,920
if you do venture into the world of like

00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:23,170
using big third-party archives of

00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:25,930
personal information about people tread

00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:27,370
carefully contact your lawyer and make

00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:30,760
sure that you're doing it in a way that

00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:32,470
won't get you say a multi-million dollar

00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:34,080
lawsuit from someone in Europe because

00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:38,800
it is entirely possible

00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:43,120
moving on assuming that you have some

00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:45,400
pile of data about what's going on who

00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:47,620
you're talking to what kind of things

00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:49,540
they're doing where they are what time

00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:52,630
it is what computer they're using stuff

00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:55,050
like that those raw signals the next

00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:58,270
step is basically translating those into

00:10:55,050 --> 00:11:01,030
meaningful context like the scenarios

00:10:58,270 --> 00:11:02,950
that you imagine someone is in the

00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:04,750
stories that you're going to use when

00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:07,060
talking to your marketing team about

00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:09,370
well okay when would we want

00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:11,410
to say something different those are the

00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:14,050
scenarios I like to think of it as like

00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:15,790
all of the raw signal data there's color

00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:19,960
there's shape there's flavor there's

00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:21,520
size there's carrots and wow I'm

00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:24,100
blanking on a lot of vegetable names

00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:25,450
right now staring at that screen but the

00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:27,880
idea is this is like your raw signal

00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:31,210
data and scenarios are when you start

00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:33,670
plucking out specific information that

00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:36,930
is going to matter to you in order to

00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:39,640
make decisions based on it could be like

00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:41,590
specific signals that you know are going

00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:44,140
to be meaningful like between 10 a.m.

00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:46,300
and 12 a.m. we want specific information

00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:48,460
to be visible on the site if you're like

00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:50,230
business with a street address and you

00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:52,180
want to tell them whether you're open

00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:53,470
right now or not that would be an

00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:56,440
example of plucking out one very

00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:58,540
specific signal and keying based on it

00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:00,130
there are lots of other ways to slice

00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:02,800
and dice that to things like I'm

00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:05,290
building out personas what kind of

00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:07,390
person do we think this is based on the

00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:09,310
signals we have about them so we could

00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:12,010
show them different stuff

00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:14,470
there's anticipated tasks things like

00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:16,570
based on what they've done and who they

00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:18,580
are and what we know about them we

00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:21,460
imagined that this is what they'll be

00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:24,340
looking for next so we can deliver that

00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:26,350
to them there's behavioral context

00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:28,990
things like this person is currently

00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:31,810
away from home or we think they're

00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:33,670
studying something right now rather than

00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:37,270
just browsing for entertainment purposes

00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:38,770
or we think they're hangry there was a

00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:42,070
fascinating personalization example a

00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:45,910
while back where they discovered that a

00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:48,670
lot of sales happened for people stuck

00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:50,410
in bumper-to-bumper traffic on their

00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:53,440
website so they ended up identifying

00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:56,110
like people stuck in traffic and angry

00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,910
are a scenario we will deliver custom

00:12:56,110 --> 00:13:00,340
content for not necessarily for

00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:01,990
everybody but it works demographic

00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:05,680
categories are also popular to talk

00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:08,910
about but historically we've found that

00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:11,320
they are a lot less effective because

00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:13,960
demographic categories tend to be a

00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:16,780
giant sink of personal biases and

00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:19,480
assumptions more than useful actionable

00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:20,990
data and we'll get to that in a little

00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:23,209
bit but like again

00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:25,130
no is this a gen Xer are they apparent

00:13:23,209 --> 00:13:27,890
do we think that this person lives in a

00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:29,390
large city or in you know a tiny suburb

00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:31,279
or something like that those are things

00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:32,930
that often will be talked about in the

00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:39,800
context of personalization and sometimes

00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:42,170
it can be useful one of the okay one of

00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:44,959
the examples that we like to call on is

00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:47,209
Angie's List if anybody's ever used that

00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:50,420
it's basically a giant directory of

00:13:47,209 --> 00:13:53,600
reviews of local services like plumbers

00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:54,800
you know doctor's stuff like that we

00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,680
worked with them when they were working

00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:59,600
on tailoring and personalizing their

00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:01,279
like initial signup page because they

00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,920
get millions of visits on it because

00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:06,020
their signup page is basically

00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:08,540
geo-targeted a geo-targeted list of

00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:10,600
plumbers in your city or something like

00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:12,620
that what they found though was

00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:14,029
depending on the service somebody was

00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:16,490
searching for and depending on where

00:14:14,029 --> 00:14:18,589
they were every attempt they made to

00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:20,120
tailor like the CTA language and stuff

00:14:18,589 --> 00:14:22,399
like that if they were able to increase

00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:24,020
signups for one group of people that

00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:26,660
they wanted that they cared about it

00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:28,339
always seemed to make signup sign-up

00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:30,980
click through worse for other groups

00:14:28,339 --> 00:14:33,709
they were sort of they were in weird

00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:35,720
trade-off zones but they didn't know

00:14:33,709 --> 00:14:37,640
where they could get good signal data to

00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:39,410
really start splitting things off and

00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:42,020
personalizing this page more in more

00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:45,440
detail well we worked with them on was

00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:49,130
developing a set of scenarios rather

00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:52,910
than demographic profiles where for

00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:54,230
different types of products we work with

00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:57,350
them to determine whether those were

00:14:54,230 --> 00:15:00,230
liked by scenarios browse around

00:14:57,350 --> 00:15:02,240
scenarios or I am currently panicking

00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:03,950
just get me a service provider so my

00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,730
house doesn't blow up because I think I

00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:07,220
smell gas

00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:09,860
like those levels of scenarios were what

00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:11,690
they ended up personalizing for and what

00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:14,300
they did was they associated that not

00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:17,209
with like weird external signal data but

00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:21,610
with each one of the provider categories

00:15:17,209 --> 00:15:25,880
so they weren't actually relying on like

00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:28,160
exotic weird we've secretly peered into

00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:29,839
the lives of these visitors to determine

00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:32,120
what they care about kinds of signal

00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:33,829
data they just said what what page have

00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:34,520
they landed on what were they searching

00:15:33,829 --> 00:15:36,950
for they

00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:38,450
search for LASIK eye surgery well we'll

00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:40,010
give them a list of doctors they're

00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:41,990
searching for kitchen cabinets

00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:43,670
let's show them lots of photo galleries

00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:45,440
because that's more of a default

00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:47,060
browsing scenario and if they're

00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,770
searching for gas leak let's just give

00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:50,390
them an 800-number real fast and get

00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:52,610
them hooked up with somebody and that

00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:54,880
provided a useful building block for

00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:58,220
future personalization without

00:15:54,880 --> 00:16:01,520
necessarily doing like false positive

00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:04,280
matches that would cause them to put bad

00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:05,600
information or less useful and less

00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:07,010
meaningful information in front of

00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,990
somebody if they had made bad

00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:13,460
assumptions about them based on the

00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:15,110
based on light signal data so the third

00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:16,850
part which is sort of what we were

00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:19,940
already starting to edge into with that

00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:23,660
example is reactions given a giant pile

00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:25,610
of data given stories that we're telling

00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:27,650
ourselves about what that data means

00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:29,780
like this person is a student who's

00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:31,910
trying to learn more or this is a busy

00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:34,700
parent who is looking for you know a

00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:37,910
product to help them the reactions are

00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:40,700
basically given those stories what are

00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:44,330
we going to do differently in our

00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:45,740
content based on those assumptions the

00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:47,600
easiest one that everybody is probably

00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:50,660
familiar with is like content

00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:52,970
recommendation you know like every news

00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:55,760
website has some sort of what to read

00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:58,430
next rotater going on and those things

00:16:55,760 --> 00:17:00,680
can be tailored to you know personal

00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:02,080
information about you or behavioral

00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:05,570
stuff about what you've read before

00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:07,330
things like what are similar articles to

00:17:05,570 --> 00:17:10,100
the article you're currently reading

00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:11,660
that may not require a lot of signal

00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:14,330
data you're just basing it on what are

00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:16,270
they reading right now oftentimes but

00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:19,160
that's still a way of providing a

00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:22,930
personalized path through the the

00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:25,070
totality of your of your pool of content

00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:26,300
incentivization is another common one I

00:17:25,070 --> 00:17:29,720
probably won't dwell on this too much

00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:31,520
but the idea of identifying key

00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:34,550
scenarios where you want to give people

00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:37,100
a discount or show a different call to

00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:39,380
action to try to induce them to sign up

00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:42,080
or buy or call for more details or

00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:44,090
something like that prioritization is

00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:45,710
another big one that's again the the

00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:48,140
Angie's List example we were talking

00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:48,830
about it didn't change what was on a

00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:51,620
page

00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:54,080
based on based on personalization it

00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:55,850
just changed what was the first thing

00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:58,190
people would see we've reordered the

00:17:55,850 --> 00:18:01,250
page based on what we thought people

00:17:58,190 --> 00:18:03,620
would find most useful and then dynamic

00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:05,240
assembly is basically taking small

00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:07,460
chunks of content that you have

00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:10,550
throughout your CMS or your content

00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:12,880
model and building out a custom page or

00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:15,530
even just portions of the current page

00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:17,780
that are tailored to the scenario that

00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:20,600
you think you're in this is probably

00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:23,150
where a lot of like energy in

00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:26,270
personalization projects goes because

00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:29,060
the idea of building out a custom

00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:31,460
landing page or a custom product

00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:32,750
information page or whatever based on

00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:35,690
the user scenario you think you've

00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:37,790
identified is like that's the Scrooge

00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:40,460
McDuck dream you know being able to

00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:41,750
tailor your message perfectly one of the

00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:45,500
problems one of the projects we worked

00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:48,170
on a while back was actually an HR

00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:51,050
intranet for like a fortune 50 company

00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:53,960
they had 50,000 plus pages to document

00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:56,630
all of their HR insurance the whole kit

00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:59,360
and kaboodle and it was awesome they

00:18:56,630 --> 00:19:01,820
wanted to reduce it to 50 pages instead

00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:03,530
of 50,000 purely based on heavy

00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:05,240
personalization everyone was on their

00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:07,280
internet they had full employee

00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:09,860
information so they could perfectly

00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:12,110
generate something about all of their

00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:16,010
like HR information their insurance the

00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:17,870
whole deal law perfect but what they

00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:19,640
ended up finding was although the

00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:22,250
technology to do that existed and they

00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:24,650
could build it out it was still a huge

00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:26,930
editorial left to start writing all of

00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:29,300
those components and accurately assemble

00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:31,940
them and even more so what they ran into

00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:34,130
was a really troubling scenario where

00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:35,960
call center support people had to be

00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:37,340
able to know exactly what page someone

00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:39,350
was looking at if they called in and

00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:40,820
asked for help understanding it but that

00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:42,380
meant that call center people needed to

00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:44,270
understand everything from what

00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:46,190
insurance someone had signed up for what

00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:48,230
their benefits were what the gender of

00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:50,480
their spouse was because of spousal

00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:53,860
insurance coverage and that collided

00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:57,680
with an interesting problem - they'd

00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:59,630
almost done they needed to be able to

00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:02,190
get all that information and they did

00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:03,659
business in in countries

00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:06,389
where someone could actually be arrested

00:20:03,659 --> 00:20:11,750
and executed for having a homosexual

00:20:06,389 --> 00:20:14,070
marriage at what point was their goal of

00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:16,730
making a fabulous and wonderful

00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:18,720
insurance coverage experience

00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:20,549
potentially setting up a scenario in

00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,600
which they could harm the very employees

00:20:20,549 --> 00:20:23,279
that they wanted to help

00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:25,289
there was no easy answer to that but

00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:28,049
we'll put a pin in that for a second the

00:20:25,289 --> 00:20:31,350
final piece of this puzzle is goals and

00:20:28,049 --> 00:20:35,009
metrics that often gets reduced to very

00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:36,840
simple analytic stuff but before you

00:20:35,009 --> 00:20:38,039
actually embark on doing personalization

00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:40,789
stuff you have to think through

00:20:38,039 --> 00:20:43,889
basically what do you want to change

00:20:40,789 --> 00:20:46,710
based on the personalization work that

00:20:43,889 --> 00:20:48,840
you're doing then ask are we actually

00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:50,940
measuring this right now someone will

00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:52,350
tell you yes we absolutely are and then

00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:54,779
you need to find that person and shake

00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:57,389
them and say no really are we measuring

00:20:54,779 --> 00:20:59,940
this it could be we want to increase

00:20:57,389 --> 00:21:01,559
sales it could be we want to reduce the

00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:05,009
number of people who call in to our call

00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:06,509
center with questions but one of the

00:21:05,009 --> 00:21:08,279
biggest challenges is something that's

00:21:06,509 --> 00:21:10,470
called if anybody's familiar with

00:21:08,279 --> 00:21:12,690
cognitive biases and stuff like that the

00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:15,000
availability heuristic as human beings

00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:17,940
were hardwired to assume that

00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:20,190
information we have at our disposal is

00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:22,080
highly relevant and that information

00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:24,210
that's off somewhere and that we don't

00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:26,549
necessarily know or have access to is

00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:28,500
less relevant than what we have in hand

00:21:26,549 --> 00:21:30,299
which is why you get people measuring

00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:33,539
things like bounce rate on sites that

00:21:30,299 --> 00:21:36,450
really don't matter how fast someone

00:21:33,539 --> 00:21:38,129
leaves if the goal was accomplished the

00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:41,879
cognitive the availability heuristic

00:21:38,129 --> 00:21:44,639
bites us really badly sometimes I think

00:21:41,879 --> 00:21:46,379
Jared spool has said he's summed it up

00:21:44,639 --> 00:21:48,570
too if changing something on your

00:21:46,379 --> 00:21:50,570
website boosted sales by 10% but doubled

00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:53,580
your balance rate would you do it a

00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:55,860
reasonable person should say yes but

00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:57,750
oftentimes we feel really twitchy about

00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:59,399
saying yes because we're trained to

00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:02,210
think that those easy to measure

00:21:59,399 --> 00:22:04,679
analytics numbers have to keep going up

00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:06,299
even if they don't necessarily have any

00:22:04,679 --> 00:22:09,000
direct correlation to the thing that we

00:22:06,299 --> 00:22:11,309
really care about like say more sales or

00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:14,009
more sadist more customer satisfaction

00:22:11,309 --> 00:22:15,520
the state of Georgia we actually

00:22:14,009 --> 00:22:17,800
recently worked with them

00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:20,620
on a project where everything they could

00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:22,750
do to increase the value of the website

00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:26,320
to the people who were residents of the

00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:28,270
state of Georgia actually hurt easily

00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:29,830
measurable metrics because people

00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:32,020
wouldn't come back to the website they

00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:33,850
wouldn't stay as long it's like all of

00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:36,610
the easy to measure numbers were saying

00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:40,179
your website's doing worse but that was

00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:43,030
the good outcome of getting people to

00:22:40,179 --> 00:22:44,290
public services faster and easier so one

00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:46,920
of the things we settled on although it

00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:49,990
wasn't perfect it was close was a

00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:52,510
decrease in the number of call center

00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:54,460
calls for topics that they were moving

00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:56,290
over to the new web system that was

00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:58,090
something that although not perfect they

00:22:56,290 --> 00:23:00,040
could look at as an indicator that the

00:22:58,090 --> 00:23:02,380
website was doing its job better for

00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:03,970
those topics and it took time to figure

00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:05,530
out that that was something to look for

00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:10,030
because it doesn't appear in Google

00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:12,220
Analytics so that's the idea the signals

00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:14,170
the raw data that you look at the

00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:16,600
scenarios that you construct out of that

00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:18,880
raw data and that you want to do things

00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:21,160
you know based on the reactions you have

00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:23,170
to those scenarios like what what you're

00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:25,150
actually changing about what you deliver

00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:27,520
and then the goals and metrics you use

00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:29,080
as part of a feedback loop to determine

00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,520
whether or not you're looking at the

00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:32,170
right signals the scenarios you're

00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:34,150
telling yourself are actually true and

00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:36,820
the reactions that you have to those

00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:38,110
scenarios are actually worthwhile and

00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:42,610
accomplishing what you care about

00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:45,130
I'm I'll do this real quick some of the

00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:46,960
places where it goes wrong are a if you

00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:48,790
don't have good structured content and

00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:51,610
good metadata it's impossible to

00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:53,950
actually drive meaningful like content

00:23:51,610 --> 00:23:56,260
assembly from this data you're just sort

00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:58,080
of throwing giant blobs of text at it so

00:23:56,260 --> 00:24:00,190
investing in that stuff early helps

00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:02,860
unreliable signals like making

00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:04,960
assumptions based on signals that you

00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:06,970
won't necessarily be able to count on or

00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:08,559
may give you bad information like

00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:10,720
assuming that someone being

00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:12,820
geographically next to an airport means

00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:14,380
they're a traveler that could just mean

00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:16,870
that they're staying at a hotel near the

00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:19,090
airport or it could mean that they have

00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:21,640
an apartment that is near O'Hare there's

00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:23,380
lots of things that you have to assume

00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:26,890
but how much weight you put on that

00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:28,510
assumption can be dangerous not having a

00:24:26,890 --> 00:24:29,020
plan or measure or you're looking at the

00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:32,410
wrong map

00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:35,740
Rick's also bad and making too many just

00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:38,200
so assumptions creating scenarios that

00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:40,870
are so finely tailored that they are

00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:43,330
basically that fanfiction for your CMO

00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:46,210
kind of stuff you know I'm imagining

00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:48,850
that the CEO of a company is coming to

00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:50,170
our website on a Thursday really looking

00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:52,870
for this particular piece of information

00:24:50,170 --> 00:24:55,690
we can deliver it up building around

00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:58,240
those imaginary just-so scenarios is

00:24:55,690 --> 00:25:00,130
almost always deeply frustrating because

00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:02,110
you rarely have enough detail to

00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:04,630
perfectly match it and nine times out of

00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:06,330
ten that's a very very narrow amount of

00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:08,380
the actual traffic you're getting

00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:10,840
reproducibility that was the problem

00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:13,240
that that HR internet had figuring out

00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:15,730
how to be able to duplicate what what a

00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:17,560
given user was seeing so that we could

00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:20,830
judge whether or not it's happening

00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:22,720
correctly oftentimes very complex

00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:24,670
personalization systems can produce

00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:28,360
one-off content and you're not

00:25:24,670 --> 00:25:29,950
necessarily sure what scenarios drove

00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:31,920
the production of it so making sure that

00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:34,930
you plan for reproducibility matters to

00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:36,340
editorial overload how much work our

00:25:34,930 --> 00:25:37,660
editor is going to have to put into

00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:40,420
managing all of these different

00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:42,610
variations and creepy messaging that's

00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:45,400
also a big one it's very easy to

00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:47,950
generate messaging that if you do know a

00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:51,610
lot about a person just creeps them out

00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:53,860
that's bad and finally it's very very

00:25:51,610 --> 00:25:56,170
quick there's some ways that it can go

00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:58,480
really really really bad

00:25:56,170 --> 00:26:00,220
and that's bias amplification the

00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:02,860
scenarios are the stories that we tell

00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:05,140
ourselves based on the data just serving

00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:07,180
as ways to reinforce our biases about

00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:09,880
our customers or about the kinds of

00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:12,430
people that need our information illegal

00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:16,510
discrimination it's very easy if you're

00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:17,980
say selling ads for you know job ads or

00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:20,410
something like that to gain two

00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:23,430
scenarios where you give people tools to

00:26:20,410 --> 00:26:28,150
do things that are literally illegal and

00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:30,280
bad for your customers for society using

00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:32,470
this stuff it's very easy to build tools

00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:36,490
that can be subverted by bad actors if

00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:38,530
you're doing let's say pump with content

00:26:36,490 --> 00:26:40,780
publishing tools in which what appears

00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:42,970
on your front page is driven by people's

00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:45,220
interests and drill

00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:47,590
by what's most popular that becomes

00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:49,360
something that bad actors can game in

00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:51,810
order to control what is on your front

00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:56,350
page for their own purposes and

00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:58,960
literally genocide it's no it is

00:26:56,350 --> 00:27:02,550
actually possible to contribute to

00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:05,200
genocide if you do your job well enough

00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:07,690
so about two years ago Facebook was

00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:10,780
working on algorithm changes to

00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:12,550
prioritize personal interactions in your

00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:14,680
newsfeed instead of just news stories

00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:17,050
and stuff like that what they did not

00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:19,860
anticipate was that they had created a

00:27:17,050 --> 00:27:23,770
system that was easy for people to game

00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:25,930
by creating thousands of personal

00:27:23,770 --> 00:27:28,360
accounts and using them to publish

00:27:25,930 --> 00:27:33,370
propaganda about Muslim minorities in

00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:37,300
Mayan Mar they gave the government tools

00:27:33,370 --> 00:27:38,980
to start a propaganda campaign and a

00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:40,810
campaign of genocide that resulted in

00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:43,150
three quarters of a million people

00:27:40,810 --> 00:27:46,180
becoming refugees 25,000 people being

00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:48,760
killed that was not part of the game

00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:50,950
plan for Facebook juicing the algorithm

00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:52,300
about whether personal interaction or

00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:56,110
news stories appeared in their newsfeed

00:27:52,300 --> 00:28:00,670
but it was the result we are building

00:27:56,110 --> 00:28:02,500
systems that identify monitor reward

00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:05,050
people for behaviors that we care about

00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:08,230
and increasingly we're offloading the

00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:11,230
big decisions to algorithms that we have

00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:13,030
trained and it's very easy to build bad

00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:16,090
feedback mechanisms if we're not careful

00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:17,530
now 99% of what we're doing is not going

00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:18,850
to result in that most of us are

00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:21,160
basically trying to swap out a different

00:28:18,850 --> 00:28:23,560
CTA block on our on our like landing

00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:26,290
page that's very unlikely to result in

00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:28,360
genocide but the better we get at it the

00:28:26,290 --> 00:28:32,350
more we have to consider what these

00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:34,000
ripple effects are yeah I'm out of time

00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:36,010
so I got to blow through some of this

00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,110
but some of the things we can do to help

00:28:36,010 --> 00:28:41,050
minimize harm are making sure we

00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:43,420
integrate feedback from and perspectives

00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:45,820
from marginalized voices who are usually

00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:48,490
the first to be harmed by bad systems

00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:50,650
that we that we build making sure that

00:28:48,490 --> 00:28:51,850
somebody's doing like Red Team exercises

00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:55,059
of looking at the stuff that we build

00:28:51,850 --> 00:28:57,039
and thinking how could I abuse this

00:28:55,059 --> 00:28:59,889
could this how could I do something bad

00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:02,169
with this and try to halt and try to fix

00:28:59,889 --> 00:29:04,090
those problems early studying the

00:29:02,169 --> 00:29:06,070
systems and the you know the scenarios

00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:08,649
in which that you exist not just the

00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:09,909
tool you're trying to build and own the

00:29:08,649 --> 00:29:11,799
choices that you're making and if you

00:29:09,909 --> 00:29:14,379
see something that you think could go

00:29:11,799 --> 00:29:16,600
wrong or be abused tell the people that

00:29:14,379 --> 00:29:18,429
you work with tell leadership and say I

00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:20,980
think we could be doing something

00:29:18,429 --> 00:29:22,779
damaging here some great books to read

00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:25,659
are technically wrong by Sarah watch or

00:29:22,779 --> 00:29:28,269
botcher algorithms of oppression and

00:29:25,659 --> 00:29:30,279
living in information responsible design

00:29:28,269 --> 00:29:32,950
for digital places those are really

00:29:30,279 --> 00:29:34,419
great ways to sort of help broaden your

00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:36,039
horizons about the kind of ripple

00:29:34,419 --> 00:29:39,700
effects that can come out of this I will

00:29:36,039 --> 00:29:41,860
now finish I appreciate you sitting here

00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:44,940
for this and as I talk very very quickly

00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:48,220
but have fun knock yourselves out

00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:50,049
remember to think through signals what

00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:51,909
your scenarios are and what kind of

00:29:50,049 --> 00:29:53,950
responses you care about before somebody

00:29:51,909 --> 00:29:55,570
pitches you a product that may or may

00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:57,010
not be able to accommodate what you need

00:29:55,570 --> 00:30:03,849
thank you

00:29:57,010 --> 00:30:03,849
[Applause]
