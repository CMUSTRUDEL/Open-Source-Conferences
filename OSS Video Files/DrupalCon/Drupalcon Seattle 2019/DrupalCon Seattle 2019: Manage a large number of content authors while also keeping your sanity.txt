Publication date: 2019-04-11
Playlist: Drupalcon Seattle 2019
Description: 
	In a world where content creation is distributed across a large team, how do small marketing and communications teams keep their sanity? With more authors, your job should be getting easier, right? Maybe in some ways ... but the challenges have shifted. Rather than spending all your time collecting and writing content, you’re reviewing and editing more while still herding all the cats.

In this session, we’ll look at how you can best practices, workflows, training, and other techniques to manage your stable of authors and the content they are producing.

I think we can get started so talk it'll

00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:10,590
with a few folks ahead of time it sounds

00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:14,070
like there's a lot of folks have a lot

00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:17,430
of content authors to manage and so uh

00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:19,439
looks like a good talk so Who am I and

00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:22,230
and why should you care why should you

00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:24,090
listen to me so I work for a company

00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:25,920
called blue spark or a full service

00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:28,529
digital agency we do a lot of digital

00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:32,130
strategy user experience design Drupal

00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:33,960
development kind of stuff so and me I'm

00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:35,960
the managing director and my background

00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:38,309
is in user experience design and

00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:41,250
experience strategy and it's been the

00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:44,129
last bit of my career focusing on how

00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:47,010
you merge kind of business requirements

00:00:44,129 --> 00:00:49,530
business analysis the mission mission or

00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:51,600
vision of the organization with kind of

00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:53,579
a great user experience and thinking

00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,129
even even bigger than that and beyond

00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:58,410
digital in terms of service design which

00:00:56,129 --> 00:01:01,829
kind of led us to led me to thinking

00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:04,559
about operations of a website you know

00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:08,250
how do you how do you create something

00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:09,990
that your staff and your team can use to

00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:11,970
actually engage your audience and drive

00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:14,369
your mission or your vision forward

00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:16,830
deliver results on that worked with a

00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:19,890
variety of clients in various capacities

00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:22,259
from from Red Hat Indiana University

00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:26,040
UCLA library and all of these are

00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:28,770
managing you know fifty to a few hundred

00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:30,840
content authors right that's even

00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:33,210
managing a large community they have

00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,829
community contributors for content so

00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:36,329
it's really fascinating the different

00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:38,780
challenges that these organizations are

00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:38,780
facing

00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:46,740
so before I start probably wondering why

00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:48,270
I have a quote of Carl C and I kind of

00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:51,119
want to lay a few like of my

00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:53,729
philosophical ideas we don't have to go

00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:54,899
all the way back to the Big Bang but do

00:01:53,729 --> 00:01:56,610
want to lay a little bit of groundwork

00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:58,729
about where I'm coming from and where

00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:01,979
some of these tips might be coming from

00:01:58,729 --> 00:02:05,670
first off let's talk a little bit about

00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:08,009
who this talk is for I like to think in

00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:10,860
terms of the content Stuart the person

00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:12,959
that is responsible for gathering all

00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:13,920
the people and and making sure they're

00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,200
producing

00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,690
quality content and in this content

00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:21,300
steward serves various roles certainly

00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:23,459
editor being chief among them but

00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:24,750
project manager particularly for bigger

00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:28,050
pieces of content they need to get

00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:31,320
published writer at times therapists

00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:34,320
certainly but ultimately it's the

00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:37,350
content stewards job to bribe cajole

00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:42,180
convince people to publish content for

00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:44,010
the website not just content because

00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:45,510
everybody anybody can write content and

00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:47,640
anybody can write content they they

00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:50,760
think is good but what you're after is

00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:52,530
content that engages your audience going

00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:54,450
to read it honey the content that

00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:55,800
engages your audience and delivers

00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:57,920
results on the vision for the website

00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:00,540
and the mission of your organization

00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:02,790
because otherwise what's the point in

00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:07,250
having a website if it's not delivering

00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:08,940
results so what makes for good

00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:10,560
stewardship what makes for good

00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:12,390
stewardship and I think there's just six

00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,610
six traits here and I'm going to quickly

00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:16,380
go over them because I don't have a lot

00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:20,250
of time and I want to make sure I get to

00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:22,260
the meat of the presentation but good

00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:24,329
stewardship is educating is teaching

00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:26,670
your content authors what it means to

00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:28,890
create good content and and coaching

00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:31,769
them and guiding them and really

00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:33,510
bringing them along it's championing the

00:03:31,769 --> 00:03:35,790
idea that your website is there to

00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:39,299
engage your audience and it's getting

00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:42,299
out there and and helping people see why

00:03:39,299 --> 00:03:44,280
they should be doing it I'm getting a

00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:47,100
little head of myself but it's

00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:48,989
encouraging people to publish it's you

00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:50,579
know writing content is a tough thing

00:03:48,989 --> 00:03:52,920
we've all stared at the blank page and

00:03:50,579 --> 00:03:54,390
been overwhelmed by that so it's getting

00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,769
out there being the therapist being the

00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:58,290
cheerleader and getting them to

00:03:55,769 --> 00:03:59,430
published its supporting them right

00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:00,120
whenever they have questions whenever

00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:03,200
they're struggling

00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:06,150
it's celebrating the success not just

00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:08,640
with your content writers but also with

00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:10,410
their managers and it's listening to the

00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,120
challenges they're facing and helping

00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:14,549
them kind of in helping break down those

00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:17,510
obstacles so in my mind these are the

00:04:14,549 --> 00:04:20,400
qualities of good stewardship that

00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:22,440
whether you're managing a small number

00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:24,090
of authors a large number of authors

00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:25,800
whether it's just yourself writing for

00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:26,280
the website these are these are things

00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:31,220
that

00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:34,380
doing common challenges that we face

00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:36,960
whenever we are particularly whenever

00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:39,780
we're stewarding content for big

00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:42,870
websites is this often is not your only

00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:45,570
job this is just one thing that you're

00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:49,020
responsible for and it's easy for that

00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:52,050
to get set aside in favor of other

00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:54,060
responsibilities that you have I'm

00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:55,710
guilty of the second one people like to

00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:57,840
have written you don't want to write you

00:04:55,710 --> 00:05:00,510
want to have written that makes sense

00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:02,820
right there's a publish it and forget it

00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:04,500
mentality so we put everything out there

00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:05,280
and we put it out there and we we're on

00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,810
to the next thing

00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,340
how is it performing how can we have

00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:10,919
made it better what can we do to improve

00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:13,350
it so it's the web it's not a printed

00:05:10,919 --> 00:05:15,090
material you can go back and change it

00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:17,490
if things aren't clear if you get

00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:19,950
feedback on it another big thing

00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:22,110
particularly I think with when you're

00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:25,139
dealing with hundreds of people who

00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:27,330
aren't writers by trade especially if

00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:29,700
they think they're good writers writing

00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:31,560
by its nature as a personal thing we

00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:34,950
think it's an expression of our self and

00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:37,380
so any kind of criticism of the writing

00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:39,810
I was often taken as a criticism of them

00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:41,910
and that's that's very difficult to

00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:45,690
overcome and it can be very emotional to

00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:48,060
have those conversations with them I was

00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:50,700
going to ask what other challenges we

00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:52,350
have but I thought I was going to have

00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:54,690
closer to 40 minutes but I only have 30

00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:55,740
so I want to keep going but I'd love to

00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:57,510
hear other challenges that you guys

00:05:55,740 --> 00:06:00,289
might be facing in your organization if

00:05:57,510 --> 00:06:04,110
any of those weren't covered afterwards

00:06:00,289 --> 00:06:05,970
but this brings us to the topic for

00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:08,669
today's talk which I want to give you 10

00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:12,960
tips for managing a multitude of content

00:06:08,669 --> 00:06:15,630
creators these are tips advice things

00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:17,160
that I've seen that I've observed in

00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:21,500
working with the organizations that I've

00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:25,260
worked with there's no silver bullets

00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:28,440
snow no magic formula it all takes time

00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:33,630
and effort and energy and and

00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:36,270
persistence so number one is easy

00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:38,400
reference material great

00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:41,130
a style guide serves as a great

00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:43,110
reference for when you should have how

00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:44,610
they should write with a what grade

00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:47,040
level of writing they should be

00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:48,450
targeting and you don't have to write

00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:50,010
these from scratch you don't have to

00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:52,800
have your own there are lots of really

00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:54,720
great style guides out there MailChimp

00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,550
has a great style guide that you can say

00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,380
look melt tip is the one that's our

00:06:56,550 --> 00:07:00,750
starting point here's the link go read

00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:02,250
that and then you can add to it if you

00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:03,420
have an intranet or a wiki you can add

00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:05,070
to it

00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:06,900
worksheets there are some really great

00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:08,640
worksheets to break down like okay

00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:12,000
what's the purpose of the article that

00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:13,770
I'm writing and my son has one of these

00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,210
a fifth grader and it's like man we

00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:16,920
should use this for writing online you

00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:19,320
start with the purpose you know what are

00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:21,000
your four or five key ideas and you use

00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:23,930
that as the basis for writing your

00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,820
article and you stick to the key ideas

00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:28,650
the content life cycle so one of the

00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:30,450
things we mentioned in the challenges is

00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:32,940
the publish it and forget it mentality

00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:35,850
well if we think about the content

00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:38,820
lifecycle from you know the idea to the

00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:40,710
draft the reviewing how we had metadata

00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:44,430
what kind of metadata we should add the

00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:47,730
publication of it promotion follow-up

00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:50,040
and in some cases the retiring of the

00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:52,560
content and we set expectations for each

00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:55,080
of the stages of the lifecycle that's

00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:58,470
going to be clear to your to your

00:07:55,080 --> 00:08:00,780
writers what's expected of them and then

00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:02,880
checklists checklists are just great

00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:04,470
there's anybody here question checklist

00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:06,420
and white checklists are awesome do I

00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:08,010
need to go into that so just you know

00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:09,690
clear like a ten point checklist

00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:11,340
whenever they're going through it did

00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:14,190
you do this did you do this did you do

00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:17,880
this great you're done publish it move

00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:19,590
on but it's not enough to have the

00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:22,050
material it's not enough to even have

00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:23,870
written it in a way that's easy for your

00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:27,360
for your content authors to understand

00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:29,970
make it easily accessible remove all

00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,380
barriers to publication so so make all

00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:33,780
your reference material your style

00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:36,300
guides or worksheets your checklist make

00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:38,370
all that like when I go to publish right

00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:40,890
there give it to them in PDF format it's

00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:43,710
in their email it's in Dropbox it's a

00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:45,060
printed right there on their desk like

00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:48,760
they can't turn around without hitting

00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:53,270
the reference material somehow someway

00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:55,220
yeah they they will they will no doubt

00:08:53,270 --> 00:09:01,310
but do but these your jobs are try to

00:08:55,220 --> 00:09:03,320
try to prevent that see streamlined

00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:05,180
workflows this is one of the challenges

00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:07,850
to I think particularly whenever we're

00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:09,170
designing we think about the challenges

00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:11,270
and issues and trying to put in

00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:12,320
constraints in terms of well let's try

00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:13,760
to make sure that we're actually

00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,170
publishing good content and a lot of

00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,520
that makes sense but we got to be

00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:17,810
careful not to put too many constraints

00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:19,460
in place otherwise that would

00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:20,930
discourages people from writing the

00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:22,760
content that needs to get published this

00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:24,430
content still needs to get published we

00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:26,510
would like to be of a certain quality

00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:27,950
but as long as it's getting published we

00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:29,180
can hit a rate to that quality so think

00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:31,430
about how we streamline our workflows

00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:34,400
and even think about working outside the

00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:36,710
content management system have people

00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:38,570
start writing in Google Docs or some

00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:41,030
kind of shared content authoring system

00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:42,770
that's not we're not it's not like a

00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:46,850
WYSIWYG editor that fills as dry as

00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:49,370
Drupal's UI sorry Drupal developers it's

00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:51,050
kind of bad but the great thing about

00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:53,030
Google Docs too is you can comment you

00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:55,220
can make suggest changes you there's a

00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:58,040
month it's a it's a full-on word

00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:59,540
processor and and you can it's much

00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:05,900
richer environment for providing

00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:07,610
feedback focused UI if you do have to

00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:09,770
stay inside Drupal I think I was talking

00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:11,420
to some somebody over here like if you

00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:14,590
have a content author and their job is

00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:17,060
writing strip away everything else

00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:19,550
except like just the features that they

00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:22,670
need and Drupal 8 that will allow your

00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:25,790
developers to change the admin UI based

00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:28,790
on the developers role and based on the

00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:29,930
the role of the author so strongly

00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:32,360
recommend you're working with your dev

00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:34,670
team to get them to do that and it'll

00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:36,410
don't expect it to work the first time

00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:38,060
you're gonna probably oh I I want to do

00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:39,860
this what happened to that field or what

00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:41,150
happened to that feature it's gonna be a

00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:43,370
little back and forth to get it just

00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:44,870
right but but if you can streamline and

00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:47,920
you could simplify stuff that would be a

00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:51,470
good step for your for your authors

00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:53,810
another big challenge for writing it's

00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:55,460
not just the writing is if this is a

00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:57,140
promoted piece or something you

00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:59,630
typically have imagery associated with

00:10:57,140 --> 00:11:00,700
it that's another big roadblock for a

00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:02,500
lot of folks

00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:05,800
is they don't like how do you select

00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:07,780
good imagery so where do I go to find it

00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:09,610
what's approved what's not approved so

00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:11,680
making sure they have access they know

00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:13,570
where media sources they can go to

00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,920
whether it's a videos or what's your

00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:17,440
policy and publishing YouTube videos

00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:19,180
stuff like that right like like and make

00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:22,450
sure it's all centralized in one place

00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:26,110
with easy links and how do you cite

00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:27,580
images so if I if I do use Creative

00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:33,040
Commons image how do I get make sure

00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:35,140
that that's cited properly never stopped

00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,700
raining so we all think about one

00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:39,070
boarding we think about that initial

00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:40,600
training step where we want people to

00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:41,710
come in there and we're gonna sit and

00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,030
we're gonna talk with them or we're

00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:44,530
gonna review it we walk through and

00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:46,360
maybe that's an hour maybe it's 90

00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:50,680
minutes and they'll create great you

00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:51,940
know everything maybe probably not so do

00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:55,360
the initial onboarding with the new

00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:57,310
folks then meet with them regularly i've

00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,690
weekly office hours if you have a slack

00:11:57,310 --> 00:12:02,020
or some kind of chat application be

00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:03,550
available periodically for that if there

00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:04,720
are some folks that need extra help them

00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:06,730
they have questions about how to do

00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,530
stuff if you've ever used calendly or

00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:10,060
where you can block off like a little

00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:12,460
bit of time for you know so that people

00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:14,230
can schedule 15-20 minute conversations

00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:16,030
with you where they can say hey I have

00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:17,230
this problem I have this challenge I

00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:19,330
just want to sit down and brainstorm

00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:21,040
with you a little bit so you can help me

00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:23,410
think through this and you can actually

00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:25,090
you know cut it get some problem cut

00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:28,030
some problems off at the pass before

00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:29,890
they develop into bigger issues and then

00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:32,980
I strongly suggest monthly refresher

00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:34,660
trainings and and got a sample agenda

00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:37,240
here where get people to share their

00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:38,920
appreciations you know the more people

00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:40,450
feel appreciated for the work that

00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:42,280
they're doing the more likely they are

00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:46,270
to continue doing it and to engage with

00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:48,040
it even more celebrate successes review

00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:49,630
publish content what was good about it

00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:51,000
what wasn't so great what they could

00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:54,040
have done better

00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:57,580
prepare people ahead of time like you

00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:58,930
said you know the writing is a personal

00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:59,920
thing you don't want to spring that on

00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:03,040
somebody you want to make sure they're

00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:04,870
comfortable with it and then an open Q&A

00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:06,940
just to give folks a chance to just ask

00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:09,370
whatever questions they have and then

00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:11,050
don't forget to promote the training get

00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:12,820
it out there let people know make people

00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:14,230
aware of it just don't like schedule it

00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:15,970
put it on people's counter

00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:18,280
and expect them to show up that's not

00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:19,600
gonna happen does he you know just do

00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,770
you want to get out there you want to

00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:24,670
make sure they're showing up do what you

00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:26,290
need to do to get people to show up Dex

00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:27,520
when and I'm sorry I'm really going

00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:30,820
through a lot of this stuff pretty

00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:32,800
quickly but know your staff know the

00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:34,120
capabilities of your staff what what are

00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,800
they good at what are they not good at

00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:37,300
don't ask if you're working on promoting

00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:39,130
you've got it event coming up and you

00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:41,020
you know don't ask somebody okay can you

00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:42,310
go out and select some good photos for

00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:44,680
this for somebody who just doesn't have

00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:46,720
the eye for it you know so know what

00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:48,280
their capabilities are and be on the

00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:52,450
look at so you might know that this

00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:55,480
person has a tendency to write more

00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:57,430
academic then what you would like be on

00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:58,870
the lookout for that and be ready okay

00:13:57,430 --> 00:14:01,000
you know they're publishing some content

00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:03,130
this week once it goes up you're ready

00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,450
to give them that feedback or try to get

00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:06,280
out ahead of that schedule sometime just

00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:08,140
sit down and review it with them so just

00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:09,130
think about your staff and think about

00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:10,480
what they're doing and what their

00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:12,960
strengths and their weaknesses are and

00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:16,390
and try to compensate as much as you can

00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:19,090
for their weaknesses a recruit

00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:20,650
assistance so you're gonna have people

00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:22,240
who are really good at what they do and

00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:24,490
maybe not initially but they develop

00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:26,530
that over time can you get some folks to

00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:28,180
you like maybe sit in on some office

00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:30,490
hours with you or where they're

00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:32,770
reviewing some content and taking that

00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:34,600
off your plate now these folks are doing

00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:35,050
your favors so maybe you get a bring

00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,340
coffee

00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:37,330
very hot eclis or something because

00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:39,540
they're making your life a little bit

00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:42,670
easier but can you find people

00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:46,240
especially if it's just a one-person

00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:48,430
show that that's it's just you being the

00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:50,590
cause the content steward can you find

00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:53,080
other people on your team that the other

00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:57,430
authors who are good at their jobs and

00:14:53,080 --> 00:15:00,510
and kind of used them as a to help train

00:14:57,430 --> 00:15:00,510
the rest of the staff

00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:08,510
touched on this a minute ago but

00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:10,820
celebrate the successes celebrate what's

00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:14,360
what's working point that out it's so

00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:16,010
easy particularly as an editor when

00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:18,589
you're looking at a piece of content to

00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:20,209
focus you know focus on get the red pen

00:15:18,589 --> 00:15:21,199
out and strike through everything it's

00:15:20,209 --> 00:15:24,110
like okay this is what we need to

00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:25,850
improve or you know okay the traffic to

00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:27,620
this article that we published that we

00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:30,410
needed excellent X percent of traffic

00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:32,240
for but it didn't hit it so easy to

00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:33,769
focus on the negative and then that just

00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:36,320
wears people down and discourages them

00:15:33,769 --> 00:15:38,810
from writing more content celebrate

00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:40,850
stuff always find stuff to celebrate

00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:42,380
even you know even if you're you've got

00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:44,540
to show them an article that's

00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:46,160
completely read find the one or two

00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:47,360
pieces in there that that's good that

00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,980
you can compliment them on you can

00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:51,199
always find something good to compliment

00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:53,480
people on and that's you got to do that

00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:57,949
you got to take the time to do that and

00:15:53,480 --> 00:16:00,620
show appreciation because like you this

00:15:57,949 --> 00:16:02,240
is but not their only job right in fact

00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:04,310
this is you know maybe that maybe it's

00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:06,320
25 to 50% of your job to kind of be the

00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:07,850
content steward for them it might be

00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:10,640
five or ten percent of their job to

00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:13,370
write the content for the website so so

00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:18,769
the appreciative and and and encouraging

00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:20,600
of that another really the I was just

00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:22,640
about this flip but I want to focus on

00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:24,680
the fourth point to the more specific

00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:26,800
you can be in your celebration or your

00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:30,649
appreciation the better it is received

00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:32,510
be as specific as you can I do art with

00:16:30,649 --> 00:16:34,820
the kids at home I volunteer and kind of

00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:36,920
teach art with with fourth graders it's

00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:39,380
in a very rewarding experience but every

00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:41,240
like like you can tell the difference

00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:43,880
when you say oh that looks great versus

00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:45,470
wow I really like the shape of that that

00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:47,510
circle there you've got a really

00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:49,279
interesting curve to it and it you know

00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:51,050
it's very different the eyes light up

00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:53,360
and and we do that as well so the more

00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:55,160
specific you can be in your complements

00:16:53,360 --> 00:17:00,170
in your encouragement the better

00:16:55,160 --> 00:17:02,089
received it will be share results right

00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:06,169
this is kind of a continuation of

00:17:02,089 --> 00:17:08,959
celebrate but show people the results

00:17:06,169 --> 00:17:10,220
that matter to them so not everybody's

00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:12,319
gonna care about the traffic to a

00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:14,000
webpage in fact some pages are probably

00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:16,760
only going to receive four or five hits

00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,850
and that's really all that it's

00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:21,589
good so so what are the results like

00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:23,630
what you know maybe you've got some

00:17:21,589 --> 00:17:24,980
feedback from a user it says I was

00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:26,839
looking for this information and this

00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:28,040
was clear and you know I got this and

00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:29,750
this was really great really appreciate

00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:32,840
that this content was out there on the

00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:34,580
website whether it's an anecdote like

00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:36,710
that whether it's you know whether the

00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:38,120
it's maybe some people do respond well

00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:40,130
to metrics where they want to see okay

00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:41,750
how much traffic is my did my event page

00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:42,650
get because we're waiting just you know

00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:46,070
I want to see how many people are going

00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:48,800
to show up but share the results pass

00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:52,280
that information on to onto your authors

00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:54,260
ideally we're not there yet but I would

00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:56,750
love to see a Drupal dashboard where

00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:58,700
whenever I'm signed into my I'm looking

00:17:56,750 --> 00:18:00,950
at my content I can actually see like

00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:03,440
metrics associated with what's going on

00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:06,230
whether it's okay traffic or or maybe

00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:07,880
there's a signup form on there like how

00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:09,560
many people signed up after they visited

00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:10,730
so you like be able to identify what the

00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:12,260
key metrics are for that piece of

00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:14,870
content and have that show up in my

00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:17,180
dashboard so I get as the author get

00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:20,240
immediate validation that my content is

00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:23,000
successful or it's not and I can go in

00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:24,830
there and tweak it and fix it right

00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,080
but that faster feedback would be really

00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:30,890
really helpful automate as much as you

00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:32,150
can right so so data architecture is one

00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:33,800
of the great things about Drupal is just

00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:35,960
how much metadata you can associate with

00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:37,790
a piece of content from tags to

00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:40,700
categories to dates all this stuff and

00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:42,590
so if you can have you know you know

00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:45,590
okay we know that this event is at this

00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:47,060
location and it's in this category we

00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:48,890
know that okay obviously it should show

00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:50,840
on that up on that locations calendar

00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:52,490
but maybe it should based on the tags

00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:54,470
that shows up but it's promoted in other

00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:56,030
places as well so we can use data

00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:57,590
architectures just to get it out there

00:18:56,030 --> 00:18:59,710
and get it promoted very easily so we

00:18:57,590 --> 00:19:02,990
don't have to do a lot of that by hand

00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:04,520
use readable comm site pianet these are

00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:06,830
really great resources they're

00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:08,690
subscription services but they're really

00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:10,910
great resources that you can run stuff

00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:14,180
through and the nice thing about

00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:17,030
something like readable is that you're

00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:19,310
taking some of the sting out of the

00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:21,020
feedback you're not it's not so personal

00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:24,320
it's like look we set a target

00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:28,340
readability score of fifth grade sixth

00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:29,900
grade so those are reasonable and in mr.

00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:33,050
professor years is a

00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:34,370
college-level wording and freezing here

00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:36,680
so we need to kind of bring that down

00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:38,390
and this is just what it is you just not

00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:40,370
I'm not criticizing your use of

00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:48,830
semicolons I think they're brilliant but

00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:52,640
this is what we have you know you're on

00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:54,320
to me and then just review the results

00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:56,060
like bring this up when you go to your

00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:57,770
weekly meetings with folks like pull

00:19:56,060 --> 00:20:00,020
like hey look our site readability score

00:19:57,770 --> 00:20:01,670
is here right or whenever you're

00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:04,880
reviewing a piece of content talk about

00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:08,210
what the readability score is but don't

00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:10,450
just give the feedback to your writers

00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:13,040
your authors give it to the managers to

00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:14,720
help them get that promotion help them

00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:17,090
get that raise right like they're gonna

00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:19,100
appreciate you so much more appreciate

00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:20,450
the feedback if they hear it from their

00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:21,950
manager if their manager goes you know I

00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:23,060
was talking to Jane the other day and

00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:24,800
Jane says you're doing great you're

00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:27,860
killing it with the content I'm so happy

00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:29,750
to hear that right that who doesn't want

00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:31,760
to hear that from their boss so so so

00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:33,530
manage up manage to their boss but not

00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:36,410
just their boss manage to the executives

00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:38,930
tell create reports I mean one of the

00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:41,570
big challenges that if I'm an executive

00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:43,130
or or a manager you go to google

00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:44,600
analytics and what do you see I I don't

00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:45,860
know what I'm looking at I can't make

00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:48,650
heads or tails of this so create a

00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:50,870
simple one-page report that you can

00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:52,850
explain very clearly look this is how

00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:54,650
our website is being successful and

00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:56,180
helping drive our mission forward

00:20:54,650 --> 00:20:57,590
helping our vision for the website this

00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:59,570
is how we are being successful with the

00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:02,060
website and here it is very simple very

00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:03,170
plain and everybody across the

00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:04,610
organization who's working on the

00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:07,430
website gets that praise so it's a

00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:08,990
little benefit from that the other value

00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:11,570
to that too as you start to feel

00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:14,960
overworked and overwhelmed which will

00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:17,680
and you do I know you do that starts to

00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:19,940
lay the groundwork for getting some help

00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:21,470
right like you're showing the values

00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:22,910
strong what's going on you're showing

00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:24,830
why this is working in why sure they

00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:27,830
should continue to invest in this and

00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:30,380
then eventually like okay you love this

00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:32,210
this is great I'm overwhelmed can I get

00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:33,670
some help please part-time contract

00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:37,120
whatever

00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:40,670
speaking of overwhelming take a break

00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:43,370
take a break small breaks throughout the

00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:44,289
day and you go to lunch turn your phone

00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:47,150
off

00:21:44,289 --> 00:21:49,960
there's virtually no emergency that's

00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:52,669
that they can't just wait a little bit

00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:54,230
this is a marathon it's not a sprint

00:21:52,669 --> 00:21:55,789
this is gonna be a lot of work to get

00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:59,410
all this stuff done so you can't just

00:21:55,789 --> 00:21:59,410
you can't just go go go go go go go

00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:06,110
another another this was something that

00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:07,760
I saw this as developer turrent time

00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:09,049
versus manager time and this is really

00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,490
helpful for me at some point so I kind

00:22:09,049 --> 00:22:13,610
of tweaked it a little bit so editor

00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:15,200
time versus focus time so there's stuff

00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:18,110
that you need to do outside the scope of

00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:19,549
managing on these authors there's also

00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:21,169
editing and other stuff you need to do

00:22:19,549 --> 00:22:22,880
so let's separate that let's say okay

00:22:21,169 --> 00:22:24,530
you know a couple hours in the mornings

00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:26,120
I have my office hours and a couple

00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:27,650
hours I'm gonna be reviewing stuff and

00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:29,690
editing stuff and then in the afternoons

00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:31,490
it's all blocked off for me to focus to

00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:34,130
do other stuff try to create blocks of

00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:35,659
time so that you can when you need to

00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:38,450
focus you can when you're interrupted

00:22:35,659 --> 00:22:39,530
you are because you can't look if you

00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:41,030
have stuff you need to focus on you

00:22:39,530 --> 00:22:42,350
can't be inartful it's just you're not

00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:44,840
it's never gonna get done you're gonna

00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:46,549
go mad doing it another thing to think

00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:48,820
about stuff a way to think about things

00:22:46,549 --> 00:22:52,940
is is this important or is it urgent

00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:55,100
right and 90 100 percent of the time the

00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:57,470
urgent is gonna Trump the important so

00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:59,270
unless you make time block time set

00:22:57,470 --> 00:23:00,770
aside time make sure the time is blocked

00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:02,210
and you're focusing you're gonna work on

00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:04,190
the important work that you have to do

00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:06,049
instead of the people knocking on your

00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:08,809
door hey can you help me edit this or

00:23:06,049 --> 00:23:10,490
fix this or do whatever your important

00:23:08,809 --> 00:23:12,620
work is never going to get done and that

00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:16,159
important work might be selecting which

00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:18,440
style guide you want to use figuring out

00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:19,970
how dealing with other kinds of content

00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:21,380
issues or figuring working with the

00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:24,380
developers to integrate with the

00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:26,450
readable API or or streamline the UI you

00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:28,159
know all that stuff has to get done but

00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:33,679
you're busy and unless you block off

00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:34,789
time for it it's not so to recap I will

00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:37,850
go through them again because I've got a

00:23:34,789 --> 00:23:41,750
minute and a half but I'm sure my slides

00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:44,530
will be available the 10 tips the key

00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:47,240
takeaways big you can't do this alone

00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:48,650
it's a big site lots of content you're

00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:50,600
not gonna be able to do this alone you

00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:53,120
need competent and powered staff that's

00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:56,059
gonna that can help you but to get there

00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:57,530
it's going to take time it's gonna take

00:23:56,059 --> 00:23:59,480
time it could first

00:23:57,530 --> 00:24:01,970
folks it could be a few months for other

00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:03,770
folks to be a few years but it's just

00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:07,370
going to take consistent persistent

00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:09,080
effort I was hoping we'd have time a

00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:10,880
little more time for questions but but

00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:16,370
I'm here so if you want to ask questions

00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:21,720
we can that's it go ahead

00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:21,720
[Applause]

00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:39,660
so the question is how often do you see

00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:41,580
like a core web team that's responsible

00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:43,890
for developing all the content versus

00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:45,150
where it's kind of more distributed and

00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:48,000
it really depends on the size of the

00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:49,860
organization like if you have you know

00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,690
smaller organizations save less than a

00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:54,330
hundred people or closer to 50 like

00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:57,390
you're gonna you might see a smaller web

00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:58,830
team that's responsible for it rather

00:24:57,390 --> 00:25:00,930
than kind of having a distribute it also

00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:02,310
depends on how much content the

00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:03,930
organization is producing you're

00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:06,180
responsible for producing like if it's a

00:25:03,930 --> 00:25:07,440
very singular this is we just have this

00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:10,560
a little bit of content it's going to be

00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:12,870
more controlled by marketing whereas say

00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:15,480
government and you know governments and

00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:17,460
libraries and just just sheer volume of

00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:20,430
content that they're producing you know

00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:22,050
the policies the all that stuff is just

00:25:20,430 --> 00:25:25,680
it can't be controlled by a central

00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:26,670
organization so I think a big part of

00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:28,850
that is just the size of the

00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:28,850
organization

00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:57,530
this is a great that is a great question

00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:59,960
and and really there isn't as the like

00:25:57,530 --> 00:26:02,420
there's no silver bullets for the first

00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:03,770
part of the question you know how do you

00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:05,090
get buy-in from your man from the

00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:07,790
managers particularly the managers of

00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:08,870
the content authors I'd sit down and

00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:10,130
listen to what constraints they might

00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:12,080
have you know is the person who

00:26:10,130 --> 00:26:13,250
overworked already and and they can't

00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,630
you know they're worried about how much

00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:15,560
time they're committing to it they feel

00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:17,180
like you know that's not necessarily

00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:18,770
important like what are their concerns

00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:20,480
listen to them

00:26:18,770 --> 00:26:22,970
there's a book called people skills that

00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:25,010
really talks about active listening so

00:26:22,970 --> 00:26:27,980
and and I find that that kind of process

00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:30,020
like it helps people feel heard and if

00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:32,270
they feel heard they in and then then

00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:34,070
you turn that around and get them to

00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:36,140
help you come up with solutions okay

00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:38,450
look I hear you these are all problems

00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:40,760
but this is what I need help me figure

00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:42,920
out so so help this so you're enlisting

00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:44,780
their help to come up with a solution

00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:46,340
and if they're helping you come up with

00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:49,460
the solution they have ownership I've

00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:52,100
buying into the solution and that's you

00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:53,540
know you still might get pushback and

00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:55,160
they still might forget that they did

00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:57,200
that in which case I mean it's still a

00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:58,820
management he's still going back hey you

00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:00,680
remember we talked about that this is

00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:02,780
what you said it's following up an email

00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:04,580
okay we had that conversation here were

00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:06,200
your concerns and here was the outcome

00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:08,330
for that and you know just getting them

00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:10,730
to agree getting them to agree and

00:27:08,330 --> 00:27:12,290
encourage public lis to where they have

00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:14,780
other people that that they've committed

00:27:12,290 --> 00:27:16,370
to is also helpful another great book to

00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:18,500
read in addition to the people skills

00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:20,060
for active listening is influence in

00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:23,930
just the different ways you can rely on

00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:26,270
influenced to and well in get to

00:27:23,930 --> 00:27:28,220
influence their what they're doing what

00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:30,850
they're saying so and what was the

00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:30,850
second half of the question

00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:40,640
yeah so that's great

00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:42,950
great question I think there's two parts

00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:44,809
to it one is goals what are the goals of

00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:47,059
the content and is the content achieving

00:27:44,809 --> 00:27:48,350
that goals and then that's where - like

00:27:47,059 --> 00:27:51,559
we talked about what's the readability

00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:52,760
score that you're after like what you

00:27:51,559 --> 00:27:54,140
know what are the guidelines that you're

00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:55,640
following and be able to be able to

00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:57,440
point to those guidelines to be able to

00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:59,270
point to that score where it's objective

00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:01,340
so as much as possible making it

00:27:59,270 --> 00:28:03,980
objective taking it out of you to be

00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:05,390
being critical I mean certainly you know

00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:06,710
if the style guide says you need to use

00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:08,540
serial commas and they're not using

00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:11,030
serial commas and if you're not using

00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:13,370
serial commas what's wrong with you I'm

00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:14,809
just just saying but right what's the

00:28:13,370 --> 00:28:16,070
you know so what does a style guide say

00:28:14,809 --> 00:28:20,049
so make it more objective the other

00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:23,270
thing too that I think hands down let

00:28:20,049 --> 00:28:25,820
users in front of the content get them

00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:28,130
recordings of users trying to understand

00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:29,780
what does this content mean so whenever

00:28:28,130 --> 00:28:31,190
you need to do this you know where's the

00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:32,299
thing is the answer on this page and

00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:36,309
they're reading through pages and pages

00:28:32,299 --> 00:28:36,309
of text or like I know it's not here

00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:42,380
exactly so so get it out of you you're

00:28:39,890 --> 00:28:44,480
as much as possible you're not the one

00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:45,950
providing that feedback it's well this

00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:47,299
is the style guide this is what it says

00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:48,650
this is the user this is what they're

00:28:47,299 --> 00:28:52,520
saying this is their readability score

00:28:48,650 --> 00:28:55,990
this so make it more objective because

00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:55,990
if it's coming from you it's subjective

00:28:56,290 --> 00:29:02,690
other questions I think we're great time

00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:06,170
excellent thanks everybody

00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:06,170
