Title: DrupalCon Seattle 2019: Lighting Talk #2: Creating Alignment with Core Modeling
Publication date: 2019-04-11

Description: 
	One of the complaints we hear the most about website redesign is how to align your organization's content needs with that of your audience. In a recent post, a university content manager stated that they created a Venn diagram with what the organization wanted on the website and what the audience needed, and sadly there was little overlap between the two circles.

The core model is a process by which we find that alignment between business objectives and user tasks. By teasing out the overlap, we can address the experience for each core item - how the page is reached, what content is available, and where the call to action takes them next.

Come grab a taste of how the core model process can work for assessing your organization's website content.
