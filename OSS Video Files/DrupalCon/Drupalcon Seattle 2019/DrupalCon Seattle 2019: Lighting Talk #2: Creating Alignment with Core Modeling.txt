Title: DrupalCon Seattle 2019: Lighting Talk #2: Creating Alignment with Core Modeling
Publication date: 2019-04-11
Playlist: Drupalcon Seattle 2019
Description: 
	One of the complaints we hear the most about website redesign is how to align your organization's content needs with that of your audience. In a recent post, a university content manager stated that they created a Venn diagram with what the organization wanted on the website and what the audience needed, and sadly there was little overlap between the two circles.

The core model is a process by which we find that alignment between business objectives and user tasks. By teasing out the overlap, we can address the experience for each core item - how the page is reached, what content is available, and where the call to action takes them next.

Come grab a taste of how the core model process can work for assessing your organization's website content.

okay how's everybody doing we still

00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:11,670
awake everybody stand up everybody up

00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:14,009
hey there we go let's wake up a little

00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:17,430
take a big breath in raise your hands

00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:21,990
over your head exhale it out to your

00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:31,470
mouths really loud and one more time

00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:36,450
come on inhale let it out great okay you

00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:38,579
may see I am going to talk today about

00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:43,140
creating alignment with core modeling

00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:46,489
and this really is is was a great setup

00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:50,399
all day as people were talking about

00:00:46,489 --> 00:00:53,430
using your your content to serve the

00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:55,140
visitors of your website really thinking

00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:59,340
through your content that it's not an

00:00:55,140 --> 00:01:02,489
afterthought core modeling is one way

00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:11,850
for that we can get there so here's a

00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:14,760
lovely family whoops I was good okay we

00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:18,509
have a growing family here right they

00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:20,520
are looking to buy a new house so the

00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:23,250
first thing they do is pick out the

00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:31,140
paint colors and then they pick out the

00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:34,500
curtains and all the furniture yes no no

00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:39,000
first thing they do is figure out what

00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:42,750
their family needs this is their first

00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,180
home what features do they need what do

00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:47,840
they need for the kids to grow up what

00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:51,180
do they need for their own private space

00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:53,939
they're not decorating the house before

00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:58,040
they pick out the house they're figuring

00:01:53,939 --> 00:02:01,500
out what will function well for them

00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:04,920
when we start by designing a home page

00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:08,369
and an architecture and then kind of

00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:10,410
work our way down it's like picking out

00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:13,800
the color of the house before we know

00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:16,560
what it is we're doing so

00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,630
 modeling is about taking the

00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,690
architecture and the layout and the

00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:24,270
design and putting it in its proper

00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:27,860
place which is after we figure out

00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:31,800
exactly what it is we're trying to build

00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:33,510
so I have a lot of experience and a ton

00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:37,470
of different things that have nothing to

00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:39,510
do with each other so I work at sleight

00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:43,650
of hand studios where a digital agency

00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:47,490
outside Washington DC so I've spent most

00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:51,840
of my career in tech I'm also a wine

00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:54,180
educator and I'm also a yogi and when

00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:57,330
you're a yogi what you try to do is

00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:59,850
align things you're aligning the body

00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:03,300
and then you're aligning what you're

00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:05,880
doing with the body with your breath so

00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:11,610
we're going to do is talk about the core

00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:14,250
model as a method of alignment okay what

00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:17,760
we're trying to do is align the business

00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:19,410
goals that we have for our website with

00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:22,470
the user tasks that need to be

00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:24,380
accomplished on that site and we're

00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:29,280
trying to find that alignment that

00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:33,000
crossover between those two things the

00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:36,090
project then reroute revolves around the

00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,760
core content it doesn't revolve around

00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:41,400
what the home page looks like it doesn't

00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:43,890
revolve around the design it doesn't

00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:46,470
even revolve around the architecture

00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:49,080
that somebody has very handily lit

00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:51,690
handed you when you walked in the room

00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:53,430
we all have those those days where are

00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:55,440
you starting a new project and someone

00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:59,220
says this is what we want it to look

00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:01,500
like ok we're gonna try to back people

00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:07,440
up and start thinking about the most

00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:11,280
important pages on your website and by

00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:13,590
doing this we're going to create better

00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,930
content and we're going to create better

00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:17,850
architecture in the long run because

00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:20,609
we're going to understand the

00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:23,070
interaction between the content and the

00:04:20,609 --> 00:04:26,190
users between the content and the

00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:27,330
business ok we're going to drive our

00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:30,110
visitors to

00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:32,789
really highly optimized web pages and

00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:36,389
what happens when they get to a highly

00:04:32,789 --> 00:04:40,080
optimized web page they're going to read

00:04:36,389 --> 00:04:42,659
it they're gonna act on it and then that

00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:46,460
is going to benefit the organization who

00:04:42,659 --> 00:04:48,990
owns that website through greater ROI so

00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:51,150
increased roi through increased

00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:56,669
conversions through more optimized web

00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:58,889
pages so if you have been to any of my

00:04:56,669 --> 00:05:00,690
other sessions on content strategy over

00:04:58,889 --> 00:05:04,819
the past few years you always see this

00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:07,800
slide because this is what I preach

00:05:04,819 --> 00:05:09,020
everybody has to be involved in the

00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:11,610
project

00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:15,659
so even though we're talking content

00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:17,909
we've got social media people sitting

00:05:15,659 --> 00:05:19,710
here we've got developers we've got

00:05:17,909 --> 00:05:23,750
designers we've got subject matter

00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:27,479
experts SEO folks architects

00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:29,099
why is everybody sitting here so you're

00:05:27,479 --> 00:05:30,300
gonna walk into this meeting and all

00:05:29,099 --> 00:05:31,409
these people are gonna be here and

00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:33,840
everyone's like I don't know why I

00:05:31,409 --> 00:05:37,639
should be in this meeting you know why

00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:40,340
am I here okay what we want is

00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:44,870
stakeholders across all the disciplines

00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:48,889
to come together and to collaborate and

00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:52,650
with the development team okay and

00:05:48,889 --> 00:05:55,469
brainstorm what we want to talk about

00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:59,419
are the business goals here we're doing

00:05:55,469 --> 00:06:03,210
our discovery you cannot do a content

00:05:59,419 --> 00:06:05,009
redesign without doing a discovery so

00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:07,169
the first part of our discovery is

00:06:05,009 --> 00:06:10,139
brainstorming on what your

00:06:07,169 --> 00:06:12,060
organization's overall goals are what do

00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:13,949
we want for this website which is

00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:15,930
usually a little bit different than what

00:06:13,949 --> 00:06:18,210
is our organization doing in general

00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:21,500
what is our goal for this particular

00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:24,240
website and really think about

00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:26,789
prioritizing them making them measurable

00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:29,190
going down to sub goals what are we

00:06:26,789 --> 00:06:31,680
really trying to accomplish so we're

00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:34,349
doing this brainstorming activity with

00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:37,700
all of these people just to identify our

00:06:34,349 --> 00:06:41,250
business goals that's step one

00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:46,380
second brainstorming session what do our

00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:48,390
visitors want we can guess and we can

00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:50,910
assume and sometimes if you have a new

00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:53,430
site you're doing a lot of guessing and

00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:55,160
assuming but if you have an existing

00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:58,110
site you've got metrics

00:06:55,160 --> 00:07:01,320
you've got tasks surveys you've got

00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:05,220
analytics you can do a thorough content

00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:07,350
audit and you can figure out what is it

00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:09,270
that our audience needs to get

00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:12,200
accomplished because all four of these

00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:16,920
audiences have totally different needs

00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:21,780
okay so we've got our business goals and

00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:25,980
we've got our audience objectives what

00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:30,600
are the course at what point does the

00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:32,970
business goal and the user task align so

00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:35,820
we're taking the same team of people and

00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:39,210
we're figuring out where this alignment

00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:44,220
is in our content okay do we have pages

00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:50,550
that align at least one business goal

00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:53,430
and at least one user task okay so I've

00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:55,980
got a task and at least one got business

00:07:53,430 --> 00:08:00,360
goal and they come together that's

00:07:55,980 --> 00:08:04,650
called a core ok so this is our overlap

00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:06,950
and this is where you may or may not

00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:09,320
currently have a page that does this

00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:11,280
because you're thinking differently now

00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:13,380
you're not thinking in terms of

00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:15,900
departments or products you're thinking

00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:18,960
in terms of where are my visitors going

00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:22,400
and what do we need as an organization

00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,400
for them to do when they get there so

00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:30,210
now we're going to take all these people

00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:34,770
who have been working on this get them

00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:37,680
to do this alignment and then send them

00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:39,780
in to a workshop and probably several

00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:41,640
sessions of a workshop because you can't

00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:46,080
do this for more than four hours at a

00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:49,360
time okay so you're going to divide your

00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:51,100
group into teams of two people

00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,350
and they're going to be from two

00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:55,029
different disciplines so if you can

00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:57,220
match up a person who's a subject-matter

00:08:55,029 --> 00:08:59,320
expert with a person who is a developer

00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:01,360
or designer that's great opportunity

00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:04,180
right there for them to start to speak

00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:07,390
at the same in the same way about the

00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:10,810
project and each one is going to work on

00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:12,490
the same core so everyone in the room if

00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:16,089
you have four teams you're all working

00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:18,700
on exactly the same core and you've got

00:09:16,089 --> 00:09:20,860
to put these these ideas down and I'll

00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:24,339
show you how to do that and then you're

00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:25,870
going to compare across teams so you're

00:09:24,339 --> 00:09:29,890
going to get some synergy between the

00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:32,500
teams and anyone who has a vested

00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:35,769
interest in this website should be

00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:37,660
available to do this workshop so here is

00:09:35,769 --> 00:09:39,399
the page if you've ever seen anything

00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:42,519
about the core model this is the forum

00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:44,560
you google it no matter who has written

00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:46,930
about the core model this is the forum

00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,339
so the first thing we do is put down

00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:51,579
what is the core page that we're working

00:09:48,339 --> 00:09:53,770
on and so in my example here this is a

00:09:51,579 --> 00:09:56,860
project that we had done for an

00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:59,140
association where they wanted to build

00:09:56,860 --> 00:10:04,120
out a new website where people can come

00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:06,790
and identify health education programs

00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:08,890
throughout the US so the universe the

00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:10,720
data from universities and then students

00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:13,209
come in and look for look for programs

00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:15,190
that align with what they want so this

00:10:13,209 --> 00:10:19,529
is the program detail page that we're

00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:19,529
showing here and the first thing we do

00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:26,260
first thing we do is say what is the

00:10:22,899 --> 00:10:28,240
user task for this core so for this one

00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:31,600
we want to look at a particular program

00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:34,000
offering then we document what's the

00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:37,029
business goal that this page is going to

00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,709
accomplish so in this case it's creating

00:10:37,029 --> 00:10:43,270
visibility for the universities that are

00:10:38,709 --> 00:10:45,670
participating in this website our next

00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:48,250
step then is to come up with the in word

00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:51,310
paths how are we getting people to this

00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:54,010
page now you might have existing metrics

00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:55,870
to support that you might have a

00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:58,180
marketing strategy that's going to

00:10:55,870 --> 00:11:01,209
support that but you can see for this

00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:02,480
particular page the home page isn't

00:11:01,209 --> 00:11:04,940
taking me there

00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:07,340
I'm getting it from a program search

00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:08,570
maybe a Google search maybe some

00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:11,720
newsletters going out from the

00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:14,870
universities or Twitter feeds so those

00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:16,720
are the inward paths to this content now

00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:18,920
we're starting to see architecture right

00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:22,390
starting to build architecture without

00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:24,830
those big flow diagrams without sitemaps

00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:26,600
the next thing we come up with is what

00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:28,670
are our forward paths where do we want

00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:31,070
to take them next and we get a little

00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:33,440
selfish here because we are the

00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:35,810
organization who owns the web site so we

00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:38,240
get to decide where to take them next to

00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:40,340
fully satisfy additional business goals

00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:43,490
of ours so here we're going to either

00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:45,470
let them contact the program learn more

00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:48,800
about the program oh maybe learn about

00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:50,330
accreditation for the program search for

00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:55,820
more programs if this one didn't meet

00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:58,640
their needs finally we say oK we've kind

00:11:55,820 --> 00:12:00,290
of got a nice flow here we know how

00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:02,150
we're getting to the page we know where

00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:04,820
we're going from the page so here's the

00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:08,870
start of our architecture and now we're

00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:11,240
going to prioritize our content and this

00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:14,060
could be a drawing it could be a list of

00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:16,520
fields it could pretty much be whatever

00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:18,920
each team comes up with because once

00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:21,260
they start collaborating this is going

00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:24,590
to change a little bit but you can see

00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:28,370
it's a small box because we're trying to

00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:30,470
say hey this is mobile first also what

00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:32,810
are the most important things prioritize

00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:37,190
how you want this content displayed to

00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:40,040
your visitors okay so now we've done the

00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:41,990
inward paths the forward paths we've got

00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:48,200
our core content and we've thought

00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:50,870
mobile so this is a thinking tool that

00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:56,930
has changed the way we have approached

00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:59,840
building a new website we often want

00:12:56,930 --> 00:13:02,870
people to change we say how do I

00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:05,360
convince somebody how do I go in the

00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:09,860
room and say we need to follow this core

00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:12,740
modeling methodology the way you change

00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:14,840
is to change yourself first get

00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:15,770
acclimated to this read as much as you

00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,339
can about it

00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:18,740
learn

00:13:16,339 --> 00:13:21,829
more about it and just start trying it

00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:25,209
out if you change yourself then you can

00:13:21,829 --> 00:13:27,970
change the world one website at a time

00:13:25,209 --> 00:13:34,149
thank you

00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:34,149
[Applause]

00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:58,020
yes

00:13:55,710 --> 00:14:00,180

00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:03,690
not have gotten the picture of that

00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:05,310
diagram that she had up there so I'm

00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:06,540
gonna have her put the diagram up for

00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:09,720
one more second so you can take a

00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:11,550
picture and then Scott delay is our
