Title: DrupalCon Seattle 2019: Case Study: The Student Experience Comes to Life
Publication date: 2019-04-12
Playlist: Drupalcon Seattle 2019
Description: 
	Join us for a rich discussion on technology and student engagement. Cornell University offers thousands of opportunities beyond the classroom – study abroad, community-engaged learning, research, scholarships, professional development and more. The problem is that for every program, there’s a website. It’s a technology ecosystem that is expensive, silo’d, and hard to navigate. One student compared Cornell to a “treasure hunt” saying students feel lucky when they find things. During this session, attendees will learn how Cornell overcame this challenge (and many others) by blending CRM, and Drupal into an accessible and personalized system of engagement. We will share a demo and key learnings from our multi-year implementation and our formula for success in improving the student experience.

Level of knowledge: beginner

	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,130
from Cornell University and we'll get

00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:12,480
started I think a few minutes early but

00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:15,540
that's that's fine yeah okay so I'm

00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,800
sorry Shannon Auburn and I Rebecca

00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:21,270
Jeffrey we're from Cornell University

00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:23,550
and we about three two years ago

00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:26,160
embarked on a project that actually

00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:29,279
started out as a Salesforce project so

00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:32,460
we had mandate from the Provost to

00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:35,219
improve the student experience and lots

00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:37,710
of our colleges were using Salesforce as

00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:42,360
a way to orchestrate experiences with

00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:43,920
our students and so we set out on this

00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:46,050
project and then we realized we needed

00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,059
an elegant front end and so we

00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:51,090
approached the custom development team

00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:56,640
which Shannon runs and she can talk

00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:59,430
about what happened then thank you so

00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,320
when Becky came to me and said you know

00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:02,579
I'm working on a Salesforce project I

00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,170
think it might have started as I need

00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:07,049
some design work of course you know some

00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:08,640
help with design and then quickly once

00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:11,280
we said well we like to start with

00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,830
discovery we like to do UX first and we

00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,420
started digging in with users we started

00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:18,119
uncovering you need more than a little

00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:20,460
little bit of design and then it quickly

00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:22,259
dove into well maybe we need to just

00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:24,119
look at what technologies were using for

00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:27,930
everything so the first thing I'm gonna

00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:29,790
show you is kind of the problem so if

00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:31,799
you are a student coming to Cornell

00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:33,240
thinking about Cornell or like the

00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:35,340
example I always like to share with

00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:36,900
everybody as my oldest daughter when she

00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:38,310
was looking for colleges she was doing

00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,869
it the wrong way the way you're not

00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:41,880
supposed to do she was googling where

00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:43,409
can this college send me you know can I

00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:45,390
go to Costa Rica with this College can I

00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:46,530
go to this cool place yeah exactly not

00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:49,229
what you're supposed to do but that's

00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:50,970
what she was doing as a student so when

00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:53,700
she came to the Cornell web site or any

00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:55,200
other sites she was looking at her whose

00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:57,479
web space as you know being in the

00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,299
universities is so so distributed in

00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:02,509
some cases so we'll watch this real

00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:02,509
quick

00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:10,119
so we find with all of our UX most of

00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:12,040
our students or potential students start

00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:13,810
with Google even if they know our main

00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:15,970
site they always go to Google and start

00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:16,870
there for the most part they kind of

00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:19,120
come to our homepage

00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:21,190
they peruse the navigation a little bit

00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,080
although you see how slow the person who

00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:24,460
did the video for us is going when I

00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:26,080
watched my oldest daughter do this it

00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:28,960
was like click click and just jumping

00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,700
all over the place and so what she's

00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:33,190
looking for coming here in this example

00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:35,350
is Becky's talking about the student

00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:36,970
experience part of that was finding your

00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:38,920
programs your opportunities to study

00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:40,690
abroad so they didn't find what they

00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:42,610
were looking for on the homepage so then

00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:44,080
they went to search study abroad well

00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:46,330
the first site is a Disability Services

00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,760
site that's not what they're looking for

00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:50,650
so what this is demonstrating as she

00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:52,810
clicks through is the Cornell web space

00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:54,130
we have like hundreds of thousands of

00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:56,739
web sites we pretty much have a website

00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:57,700
for everything every unit every anything

00:02:56,739 --> 00:03:00,190
you could ever imagine

00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:02,040
and so being a student coming here to

00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:04,989
think of okay if I spend four years here

00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:07,330
what can I do what kind of opportunities

00:03:04,989 --> 00:03:10,269
can Cornell open up for me it's very

00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:11,950
hard or was very hard to find these this

00:03:10,269 --> 00:03:14,920
example has shown you they've gone from

00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:17,230
Google to the home page to now a page

00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:19,360
not found they ended up on a disability

00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:21,280
services site it's kind of all over the

00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,799
map for students to try to find and

00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:28,150
figure out where they want to be to get

00:03:23,799 --> 00:03:30,700
this kind of information so when we did

00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:32,799
a UX phase to talk to students you know

00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:34,810
focus groups interviews why have you

00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:36,280
before kind of diving in on the

00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:38,860
technology side on how are we gonna

00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:40,330
solve this things we heard was currently

00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:42,489
to find things I have to go to many

00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:45,100
internal and external websites like we

00:03:42,489 --> 00:03:46,180
just saw a minute ago most people don't

00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:48,430
even hear about these opportunities

00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:49,870
until three days before the event and

00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:52,180
then in most cases what they're saying

00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:54,040
is they can't even go and then right now

00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:55,540
this was my favorite quote Cornell is

00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:57,549
like a treasure hunt because we're

00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:59,350
talking about opportunities here but

00:03:57,549 --> 00:04:01,060
there's many other examples across our

00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:03,850
university web spaces you could apply

00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:05,350
this to and so basically the student

00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:09,010
meant you're really lucky if you find

00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:10,720
something at Cornell but that's not how

00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:14,349
we want our students to find things we

00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:18,380
don't want them to find it based on luck

00:04:14,349 --> 00:04:21,410
and so what we ended up with is we need

00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:23,630
a website that helps students pull

00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:25,460
things together across campus aggregates

00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:27,290
them and then partner that was

00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:29,450
Salesforce in the backend we needed it

00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:31,700
to be open to the public we needed it to

00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:34,730
be you know help that discovery they

00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:36,620
need to do and so as we started doing

00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:39,139
comps for what this website would look

00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:41,930
like things we started hearing and then

00:04:39,139 --> 00:04:44,030
also as its moved to launch very easy to

00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:46,970
find things like the style

00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:48,380
it's organized super helpful you know

00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:50,479
everything's bringing it together in one

00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:52,040
place so much I could have done you know

00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:53,690
somebody reflecting back now that they

00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:56,360
see this I oh I could have done so much

00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:58,970
more here in my time and so I'll give

00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:01,750
you a quick preview and we'll talk

00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:01,750
through this a little bit

00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:13,270
all right so this is the case that

00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:15,240
someone knows the URL so find your

00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:17,770
opportunity they come to the website

00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:20,110
they can quickly filter into their

00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:25,660
opportunities via the Drupal website

00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:28,060
they're gonna go in for global and then

00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:30,520
as they click they get a pre filtered

00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:32,760
view of the global opportunity so this

00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:36,550
is now in Drupal I think we have 800

00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:38,410
opportunities or north of that and so

00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:40,600
Drupal was really important here for

00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:42,250
content there's a lot of content here we

00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:45,100
didn't want to use Salesforce for all

00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:46,990
this content storing and drupal using a

00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:49,810
content type a really big content type

00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:53,800
for this was really good for let's get

00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:56,200
as consistent as we can in the view of

00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:58,450
the opportunities so now we're clicking

00:05:56,200 --> 00:06:00,190
over to the application so the student

00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:04,690
clicked apply I'm gonna go back to that

00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:06,790
real quick so this is kind of where we

00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:09,280
kick over to Salesforce you see that

00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:10,300
apply button there and they'll click on

00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,920
that in just a minute

00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:13,810
it stays with them no matter what page

00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:15,940
they're on and the opportunity this page

00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:17,500
has a lot more content but when they get

00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:19,300
down and they click apply this is where

00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:22,720
we do the handshake between Drupal and

00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:25,780
Salesforce so we styled Salesforce to

00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:27,850
kind of make it not quite so jarring as

00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:28,930
you go between the two and then I'll

00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:32,140
turn it over to Becky talked a little

00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:34,810
bit and so on Shannon's team I mean the

00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:36,220
the user experience research showed us

00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:38,290
that students can't find things at

00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:40,450
Cornell and so the goal of the project

00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:43,030
became to help students find and apply

00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:45,640
to opportunities not just study abroad

00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:47,860
but research and immersive learning and

00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:49,570
all kinds of things and so but the

00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:51,310
important thing is is if all they do is

00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:53,380
find it you don't know what they're

00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:54,850
doing we had no way of tracking that a

00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:56,950
student was actually going to France

00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:58,570
unless we called the Study Abroad Office

00:06:56,950 --> 00:07:01,480
and they had their own little

00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:03,160
applications tool and students would

00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:04,870
apply so they could report and then we

00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:06,940
could go to the research office but

00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:09,430
which is like faculty all over campus

00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:11,110
there is no office and find out oh then

00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:13,510
the student did a research project and

00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:17,050
so only by linking it to this

00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:18,850
application tool built in Salesforce now

00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:19,729
we can track what our students are doing

00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:21,529
and

00:07:19,729 --> 00:07:25,129
to me as the important marriage of

00:07:21,529 --> 00:07:27,710
content and CRM which is tracking people

00:07:25,129 --> 00:07:30,229
in their activities and liability then

00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:31,819
in this tool when they're applying we

00:07:30,229 --> 00:07:34,069
can then start to orchestrate their

00:07:31,819 --> 00:07:35,779
process so we could see if a student

00:07:34,069 --> 00:07:37,849
started in their application and stopped

00:07:35,779 --> 00:07:38,389
you could send them a prompt in three

00:07:37,849 --> 00:07:40,339
days

00:07:38,389 --> 00:07:42,229
once they apply and they're in the

00:07:40,339 --> 00:07:44,270
system you can add them to a community

00:07:42,229 --> 00:07:46,279
group to meet the other students who

00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:49,099
have applied you can do all kinds of

00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:50,900
process orchestration and so that's the

00:07:49,099 --> 00:07:53,319
the rich marriage I think between the

00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:53,319
two systems

00:07:53,469 --> 00:07:57,620
when we first started talking in a pause

00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:59,809
this just for a second before the

00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:01,159
handoff goes back to joyful when we

00:07:59,809 --> 00:08:03,199
first started talking about what she

00:08:01,159 --> 00:08:04,999
need being a leading a web group our

00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:08,509
answer was you don't need Salesforce you

00:08:04,999 --> 00:08:09,800
just custom we we were not sold why do

00:08:08,509 --> 00:08:11,210
you even need that it's just one more

00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:14,479
thing to integrate one more point of

00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:16,699
failure however I'd say leapin two years

00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:18,830
forward a lot of what Becky just

00:08:16,699 --> 00:08:20,719
described is that like the marketing

00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:22,219
automation and pushing you know we're

00:08:20,719 --> 00:08:24,349
just one website at the experience

00:08:22,219 --> 00:08:25,999
website but there's a lot of websites

00:08:24,349 --> 00:08:27,409
that can connect to Salesforce so for

00:08:25,999 --> 00:08:29,120
the student record we're starting to

00:08:27,409 --> 00:08:30,740
build this repository so then it kind of

00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:33,380
came to light even for the web team on

00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:35,089
okay Drupal is gonna do all of this but

00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:37,159
there is a little niche that makes sense

00:08:35,089 --> 00:08:39,829
to connect over to Salesforce we did

00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:42,380
that with the drupal salesforce suite we

00:08:39,829 --> 00:08:44,449
partnered with marcus at message agency

00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:46,610
and they were a great partner to help us

00:08:44,449 --> 00:08:48,880
figuring out how to use that suite to

00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:50,990
connect your poll into salesforce i

00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,940
think that was really important because

00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:54,860
we had many endless conversations and

00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:57,680
figuring out what data do we send over

00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:59,029
what data do we just keep in drupal how

00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,980
are we sending it over what are we

00:08:59,029 --> 00:09:02,930
pulling back and so there was a lot of

00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:04,670
once we got through the ux phase really

00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:06,350
just digging in to figure out how do we

00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:08,750
bring these two technologies together so

00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:10,670
for the end user it feels seamless so

00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:11,779
they kind of bounced out here students

00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:13,550
will never know they're in salesforce

00:09:11,779 --> 00:09:15,470
when they're filling this out but once

00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:17,380
they get to you know the end of their

00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:20,089
application what it's going to show is

00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:20,810
they can submit their application here

00:09:20,089 --> 00:09:23,120
in just a minute

00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:24,920
and then they're gonna be able to come

00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:27,079
back to drupal because all the student

00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:29,510
knows is experienced cornell they don't

00:09:27,079 --> 00:09:31,250
know whatever this URL is

00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:33,769
and they're not going to go check their

00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:38,240
status over in salesforce at least at

00:09:33,769 --> 00:09:41,839
least not for this i think after they

00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:43,639
click 'save they go back alright so the

00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:45,560
submit application it kind of tracks

00:09:43,639 --> 00:09:47,750
down the side all the steps they have to

00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:50,529
do before they go back so they're good

00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:53,449
it tells them click on your dashboard i

00:09:50,529 --> 00:09:55,370
can tell you the single sign-on handoff

00:09:53,449 --> 00:09:59,930
between drupal and Salesforce was

00:09:55,370 --> 00:10:01,910
probably where we spent a lot of time to

00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:04,070
say when if my devs worked kind of

00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:05,510
Drupal magic figuring that out that

00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:09,320
would be a whole different session but

00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:12,139
getting sam'l to work with both Drupal

00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:13,699
and Salesforce was quite a bit so here

00:10:12,139 --> 00:10:15,410
is the dashboard so they came back here

00:10:13,699 --> 00:10:17,060
so this is the site they recognized and

00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:19,399
this is the site that can go back to so

00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:20,959
what we're doing is we're pulling ok I'm

00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:23,540
a student I came back to my dashboard

00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:25,010
here's my salesforce applications again

00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:26,540
they don't know they're salesforce we're

00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:28,070
masking that we're kind of created like

00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:30,440
a teaser page for the students so they

00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:32,420
can track we're also pulling more data

00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:34,579
back from salesforce here later on as

00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:37,279
the application is processed so as

00:10:34,579 --> 00:10:39,949
something's approved or waiting for

00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:42,019
review or you know whatever the status

00:10:39,949 --> 00:10:44,149
is the student can eventually then

00:10:42,019 --> 00:10:51,800
withdraw or confirm here right from the

00:10:44,149 --> 00:10:54,260
website that they're used to so this is

00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:56,420
an example of a more robust a student

00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:58,339
who has a whole bunch of applications

00:10:56,420 --> 00:11:05,720
going on the one we looked at was just

00:10:58,339 --> 00:11:07,430
to yeah and so here we used again sort

00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:08,899
of the process orchestration idea of not

00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:10,430
just letting the student apply but

00:11:08,899 --> 00:11:13,010
helping them through it so they can see

00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:16,069
the status of their application if they

00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:17,959
and then in the backend in salesforce

00:11:16,069 --> 00:11:19,880
there's a person who's admitting them to

00:11:17,959 --> 00:11:21,920
the program once they're admitted it

00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:24,709
then kicks them up to that top section

00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:26,690
where they can commit or withdraw and

00:11:24,709 --> 00:11:29,060
then we can move them to an onboarding

00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:30,500
checklist and so all that process

00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:33,390
orchestration makes it a richer

00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:35,450
experience than other you know

00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:38,160
independent form tools or things that

00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:42,540
schools often use for students to apply

00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:44,760
to things became really important data

00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:46,230
to pull back over into Drupal Drupal

00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:48,090
from Salesforce what we heard through a

00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:50,250
lot of the UX testing was these

00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:51,360
applications I mean you saw kind of a

00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:53,610
light process going through the

00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,590
applications they're huge they're long

00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:57,030
it takes them forever to fill out and

00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:59,460
then once do they've even filled it out

00:11:57,030 --> 00:12:00,930
there's a whole slew of checklist items

00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:02,640
they have to go do to really have

00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:05,010
Cornell send them abroad to be able to

00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:06,480
study abroad and so here it tracks for

00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:08,550
them in their dashboard we pulled data

00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,350
points back from Salesforce okay out of

00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:12,450
seven all right they filled out three

00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:14,130
have they filled out four instead of

00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:15,450
making this students maybe traditionally

00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:17,670
what we would have done five years ago

00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:19,050
you go here for this and then here's a

00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:20,460
whole nother place you go to to go

00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:22,470
figure out all this information we do

00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:24,060
that a lot we have separated systems for

00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:25,200
a lot of things so this was a nice

00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:32,340
marriage to bring those two things

00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:34,830
together and so the the formula that

00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:38,250
we've discovered in trying to blend CRM

00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:40,080
and CMS like Shannon said earlier I

00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:41,850
think what her team might have been

00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:44,640
doing in the past was using Drupal to

00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:46,860
build CRM type functionality and then

00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:48,360
the CRM Salesforce team was using

00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:50,850
Salesforce to build content

00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:55,020
functionality and so merging these two

00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:57,120
the formula for us has become discovery

00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:59,610
if students need to find or discover

00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:01,440
something that is content and that

00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:03,480
should be built in Drupal but when they

00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,070
need to engage where you need to

00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:07,110
understand a person and how they're

00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:09,750
moving through a process that is

00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:12,360
Salesforce and so so the blend of those

00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:14,370
two tools and then once you have that

00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:16,950
engagement data you can feed that into

00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:19,320
your CRM platform which is the student

00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:22,530
record and that's the data that you can

00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:24,870
report on and do a whole bunch of things

00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:27,270
with and you can track the students

00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:29,610
activity not just for these applications

00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:35,610
but for lots of other things as well do

00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:37,230
you want to go to the next slide it took

00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:39,630
me a while to come around to you because

00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:41,730
I would keep saying no you can do that

00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:44,160
too you can build those things in Drupal

00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:45,510
what finally kind of really helped

00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,580
understand that

00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:49,440
how does a student move around the

00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:52,110
university because they're they become

00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:54,000
point solutions and so I think really

00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:55,800
we're contributing to that student

00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,270
record just like the next website that

00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:59,670
connects to Salesforce is gonna add to

00:13:57,270 --> 00:14:01,050
the student record so we're really you

00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:02,339
know I think it took us a while to get

00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:04,320
there but then it kind of came around

00:14:02,339 --> 00:14:07,140
you know using everything for their

00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:12,420
their best fit and so in this student

00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:14,760
record advisors see about student

00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:16,920
activity and so here in this space is

00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:19,320
the applications these are all the

00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:21,210
things that a student has applied to but

00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:22,890
we don't just see that piece of their

00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:24,810
experience we also see the meetings

00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:26,910
they've had with an office the

00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:29,100
appointments they've scheduled in their

00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:31,320
office and other offices across campus

00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:34,560
so so by building those engagement

00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:36,480
modules we're able to get a full a full

00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:38,460
view of student activity across Cornell

00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:40,279
the applications but other things as

00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:43,320
well

00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:45,960
Salesforce yeah and this is just native

00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:52,140
Salesforce it's what a CRM is is it's a

00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:54,029
360 degree view of a constituent yes in

00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:55,620
our case PeopleSoft yet but that's over

00:14:54,029 --> 00:14:58,380
here that's our system of record data

00:14:55,620 --> 00:15:00,390
and then the difference between an ERP

00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:02,220
and Salesforce is you're not just

00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:04,860
capturing system of record data but

00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:06,720
engagement data and so the question is

00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:14,130
how do you get the engagement data and

00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:15,959
it's through these engagement tools and

00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:18,360
so because we did the front-end in

00:15:15,959 --> 00:15:20,730
Drupal and not in Salesforce we could do

00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:22,260
really other cool great things and so

00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:24,240
connecting sites across campus

00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:26,040
consistent content was also what we

00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,900
heard from students I might find the

00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:30,570
opportunity to describe this way on this

00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:33,240
website this way on this website and

00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:35,880
barely at all on this website so what we

00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:38,339
did is we created a feed from our

00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:40,350
experience site so that all the

00:15:38,339 --> 00:15:42,150
different colleges or units across

00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:44,880
campus could consume that data and

00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:47,490
render it on their websites so it stood

00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:49,050
two really great things one the video

00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:51,480
I'm going to show in a second it saved

00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:53,280
them a huge chunk of budget when they

00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:55,470
were going to redesign their site they

00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:57,300
had all this functionality written up to

00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:59,850
do exactly what we built an expiry

00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:01,920
for opportunities and so we got involved

00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:03,690
and said okay don't do that let us build

00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:05,010
it and then you guys just consumed the

00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:07,680
feed from us and render your

00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:09,990
opportunities however you want to so

00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:12,029
they had a big win from that and then as

00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:13,980
we kind of roll this out across campus

00:16:12,029 --> 00:16:15,690
the idea is the college sites will start

00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:17,550
you know highlighting the opportunities

00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:20,250
that they have on their web sites to to

00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:22,940
kind of keep that consistent voice for

00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:22,940
the opportunities

00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:36,730
so in this use case the students going

00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:38,890
to global at Cornell edu or education

00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:40,750
abroad so they might have met with an

00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:44,640
advisor and their advisor said here go

00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:47,530
here and so they go to discover programs

00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:50,500
and they pick college administrated or

00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:52,870
administered so here you see each one of

00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:55,150
these you know sort of cards this is all

00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:57,190
coming over the teaser content from our

00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:58,780
site and then they're linking to it they

00:16:57,190 --> 00:17:03,280
have two options one they can link to

00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:04,450
our details page or there's some that

00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:06,400
are really important for them this is

00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:08,320
their you know Cornell sponsored ones

00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,150
and so when you click on them they're

00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:11,860
taking our content and they're putting

00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:13,390
their design wrapper around it they're

00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:15,040
taking the fields and they're saying

00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:16,660
these are so important I actually want

00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:18,130
to run through these on my own site and

00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:20,050
I want to put a little more around them

00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:22,150
so that's working really well it's

00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:23,620
keeping things consistent it saved them

00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:25,480
time they didn't have to write content

00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:26,950
for one web site write content for

00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:29,050
another web site because we're knocking

00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:30,640
on their doors to saying we need content

00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:33,750
for our web sites so it's streamlining

00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,750
it a lot for them

00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:43,320
so in addition to the content

00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:47,190
experienced across campus we also have

00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:49,530
an engagement tracking experience across

00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:52,740
campus so we can track student

00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:55,620
engagement with a 360-degree view so

00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:57,330
examples of other engagement modules

00:17:55,620 --> 00:18:00,420
that we have either integrated with

00:17:57,330 --> 00:18:02,130
Salesforce or built our appointment

00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:04,260
scheduling we use Microsoft bookings

00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:05,970
students can make online appointments

00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:07,890
their appointments go into the student

00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:12,510
records so we can see if they met with

00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:15,090
the transfer student office or different

00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:17,010
different units across campus there's a

00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:19,650
check-in module so when a student comes

00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:21,600
into an office they check in ultimately

00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:24,240
we'll extend this to other things across

00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:26,880
campus the gym the tutoring center the

00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:29,520
advising Center and so we'll get to

00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:33,240
start to understand the student you know

00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:35,240
where where they're gained where they're

00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:39,510
getting services that we're providing

00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:41,280
and email tracking this is this is not

00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:44,040
to track every email that goes out to a

00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:47,670
student but if an advisor wants to keep

00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:49,200
a record of a conversation and this is

00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:51,630
an Outlook plug-in that goes into

00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:53,760
Salesforce and you just see see

00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:55,350
Salesforce and it goes into the student

00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:57,300
record as well so it just makes it

00:18:55,350 --> 00:19:00,180
you're not having to cut and paste and

00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:02,580
do all that so this I think tracking

00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:04,290
their engagement is important and I know

00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:06,450
there's all kinds of privacy issues

00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:07,620
about this like what do you know do we

00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:09,690
have the right to do that

00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:11,850
we will have a student consent process

00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:13,410
where they sign off they sign it when

00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:14,880
they arrive but we're trying to be more

00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:18,270
deliberate when they actually enter the

00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:21,000
system that they check it off but I

00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:23,310
think it's you know Cornell invests a

00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,110
lot in resources and if we don't

00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:27,150
understand if students are using them we

00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:28,470
can't improve them and we can't you know

00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:30,150
if there's a tutoring center

00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:32,130
are we staffing at the right hours when

00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:33,990
students really need it things like that

00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:35,460
so we'll have data now that we can use

00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:37,910
to answer those kinds of important

00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:37,910
questions

00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:47,210
so looking ahead back to kind of the

00:19:44,889 --> 00:19:49,309
360-degree view and tracking engagement

00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:51,529
we're starting to we've got the

00:19:49,309 --> 00:19:52,940
experience design well maybe we should

00:19:51,529 --> 00:19:54,470
go look at the front desk check-in

00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:56,960
that's here and try to align that a

00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:59,149
little better or if we have a student

00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,950
support community website that should

00:19:59,149 --> 00:20:02,750
align so we're trying to take things

00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:04,039
that are in the student experience and

00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:06,889
align them better with a family of

00:20:04,039 --> 00:20:10,100
designs looking ahead experience Cornell

00:20:06,889 --> 00:20:11,750
itself more features obviously if you

00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:13,370
launch something that always gets a lot

00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:14,929
of eyes on it and then everybody wants

00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:17,120
something added to it so we've got a

00:20:14,929 --> 00:20:20,450
whole JIRA list of things people would

00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:21,649
like we question ourselves a lot you

00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:22,789
know could we have done it different

00:20:21,649 --> 00:20:24,230
should we have done it different should

00:20:22,789 --> 00:20:25,880
we have done Drupal in the backend to

00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:27,500
manage the content and a react front-end

00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:30,279
so that we could have done the front-end

00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:32,720
a little differently resource library

00:20:30,279 --> 00:20:35,210
much like we have a whole library of

00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,590
opportunities next idea for campus would

00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:39,679
be if you're a student and you want to

00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:41,240
find resources across campus how do you

00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:43,190
find them well right now I think you do

00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,779
the same thing to the way you used to

00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:48,679
find the opportunities you hunt and you

00:20:44,779 --> 00:20:50,090
search and you try to find them a few

00:20:48,679 --> 00:20:56,330
others you want to talk about digital

00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:58,370
signage marketing automation and so find

00:20:56,330 --> 00:21:00,950
your resource so we have experienced

00:20:58,370 --> 00:21:03,860
Cornell edu the long term vision is find

00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:07,010
your opportunity find your resource find

00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:08,600
your event find your courses you know we

00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:11,000
can kind of go down the line with that

00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:12,919
and then for each content type there's

00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,830
an engagement type right when you find

00:21:12,919 --> 00:21:18,200
an opportunity you apply when you find a

00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:20,269
resource you check in and that that

00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:24,559
allows us to have that kind of data that

00:21:20,269 --> 00:21:26,090
we need the one of the biggest values I

00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:27,860
think is what Shannon said is that we

00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:29,809
have a system of record for all our

00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:31,309
opportunities across campus now and

00:21:29,809 --> 00:21:33,590
we've never known that you know if a

00:21:31,309 --> 00:21:36,049
Dean asked how many research programs

00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:38,690
are out there we would have no ability

00:21:36,049 --> 00:21:41,870
to answer that question and now that we

00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:44,179
have this content repository or a system

00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:45,710
of record for opportunities we can push

00:21:44,179 --> 00:21:48,350
it not just into other web sites but

00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:51,100
into digital signage across campus so

00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:54,190
now our content can be geo-located

00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:56,740
based on interest so if we want to push

00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:58,210
out certain programs to computer science

00:21:56,740 --> 00:22:00,309
students we can go to the cafeteria

00:21:58,210 --> 00:22:05,110
where they hang out and put the content

00:22:00,309 --> 00:22:09,070
there we're also trying to do more with

00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:11,200
a mobile experience and that's you know

00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:13,660
this site is responsive it's wonderful

00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,130
but on our mobile experience design

00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:17,169
we're thinking about what students are

00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:20,250
actually needing their phone to do to

00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:23,409
check in as they move across campus to

00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:25,600
see their appointments and so we will

00:22:23,409 --> 00:22:28,230
coordinate with the the Drupal the what

00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:31,150
custom dev team to build that experience

00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:33,760
and then email automation and marketing

00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:36,220
automation those are really powerful

00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:37,840
out-of-the-box Salesforce tools that I

00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:40,690
think once we start to have this ability

00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:43,539
to orchestrate experiences for students

00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:46,030
we can then promote other opportunities

00:22:43,539 --> 00:22:49,210
to them based on a point in time so

00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:52,150
maybe you know if the resource find your

00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:54,100
resource if students grade goes down we

00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:55,480
could push out content automatically

00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:57,850
without somebody having to figure out

00:22:55,480 --> 00:23:00,580
who those students are push out content

00:22:57,850 --> 00:23:02,230
for the tutoring center if a students

00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:04,030
taking Spanish or they enroll in the

00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:05,470
Spanish class we could push out content

00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:12,220
saying hey have you considered these

00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:13,299
study abroad programs and then the last

00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:16,030
thing I'll say is now that we've

00:23:13,299 --> 00:23:18,760
discovered this magic um it's it's very

00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:20,950
much in demand now and so as we launch

00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:24,159
other initiatives around different

00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:26,320
constituents right we focus the past two

00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:27,789
years on students next we're moving to

00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:29,860
corporate relations and our corporate

00:23:27,789 --> 00:23:31,960
relationships and I think we'll repeat

00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:35,350
the formula of having a Content a

00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:37,990
discovery platform for so external

00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:40,480
organizations can understand Cornell and

00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:42,429
all that we have to offer and then they

00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:44,110
will engage somehow through some

00:23:42,429 --> 00:23:46,059
Salesforce tools and then we'll have

00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:48,400
that constituent record of that

00:23:46,059 --> 00:23:51,669
relationship but the the power of Drupal

00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:54,760
to me is that it's content that draws

00:23:51,669 --> 00:23:57,820
people in that's how you present what

00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:58,210
your institution is about to the outside

00:23:57,820 --> 00:24:00,309
world

00:23:58,210 --> 00:24:02,350
and once they're in then you can engage

00:24:00,309 --> 00:24:04,269
them but if you only

00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:05,860
I come from the Salesforce world if all

00:24:04,269 --> 00:24:08,320
you do is Salesforce you're not

00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:20,769
attracting people to get the engagement

00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:22,299
that you need to track that our

00:24:20,769 --> 00:24:24,880
applications were already in sales first

00:24:22,299 --> 00:24:26,529
they weren't no yeah we had point

00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:29,139
solutions so you know some people use

00:24:26,529 --> 00:24:31,750
Google Forms some people use Tara data

00:24:29,139 --> 00:24:33,429
for study abroad fluid review there's

00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:38,169
all kinds of tools out there that

00:24:33,429 --> 00:24:40,120
different offices are using yeah right

00:24:38,169 --> 00:24:43,990
but and that's the challenge right so

00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:46,240
Teradata is a study abroad portal where

00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:48,429
students can apply but it doesn't work

00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:51,490
for domestic opportunities so Cornell in

00:24:48,429 --> 00:24:53,710
Washington DC wasn't in there and then

00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:56,230
that Study Abroad Office they owned the

00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:58,120
tool and what they would find is the

00:24:56,230 --> 00:25:00,580
other offices that wanted to have an

00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:02,500
application would be in their tool and

00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:04,480
so suddenly the study of how people are

00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:06,340
managing a technology platform for

00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:11,289
offices that aren't their own so it's a

00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:13,720
really it was a crazy ecosystem so as

00:25:11,289 --> 00:25:16,649
far as information that you're pulling

00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:20,019
in from Salesforce are you actually ever

00:25:16,649 --> 00:25:22,000
showing pulling user information into

00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:29,049
the Drupal site at all or is it only

00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:34,509
just displaying it so then you have user

00:25:29,049 --> 00:25:37,629
accounts and on multiple places the

00:25:34,509 --> 00:25:39,970
profile between the two correct so for

00:25:37,629 --> 00:25:43,629
the it was really easy for the Cornell

00:25:39,970 --> 00:25:46,419
login side it was easier on the Cornell

00:25:43,629 --> 00:25:47,980
login side yeah on the non Cornell

00:25:46,419 --> 00:25:50,169
log-in side we went back and forth with

00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:52,120
Salesforce have the user profile what

00:25:50,169 --> 00:25:53,679
Drupal have the user profile at the end

00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:55,419
of the day Salesforce creates the

00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:57,159
profile and just sends the data back to

00:25:55,419 --> 00:25:59,860
Drupal and then my second part of the

00:25:57,159 --> 00:26:00,639
question is kind of off his so did you

00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:03,309
already have

00:26:00,639 --> 00:26:06,639
so obviously Cornell is heavily invested

00:26:03,309 --> 00:26:10,840
in the Salesforce so did you already

00:26:06,639 --> 00:26:12,230
have like that whole UI and so basically

00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:14,600
did you have to develop

00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:17,330
the UI tools that you needed for

00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:20,299
Salesforce as well like like basically

00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:23,149
did you have to develop two things yes

00:26:20,299 --> 00:26:24,950
and that's I think where the sales for

00:26:23,149 --> 00:26:26,450
steam-operated pretty independently cuz

00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:27,679
we had such a tight timeline but now

00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:30,710
we're stepping back and we're really

00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:33,859
going to use the UX talents of Shannon's

00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:37,690
team to help us make those better

00:26:33,859 --> 00:26:40,070
experiences okay thank you the

00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:42,409
opportunity data that you have in Drupal

00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:44,389
our departments all across campus

00:26:42,409 --> 00:26:46,639
entering that directly in and how do you

00:26:44,389 --> 00:26:49,659
manage what they can enter and what tags

00:26:46,639 --> 00:26:52,070
they can use and who has access

00:26:49,659 --> 00:26:54,379
everybody gets tagged happy that's our

00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:56,090
biggest problem they did hire somebody

00:26:54,379 --> 00:26:58,249
who's supposed to start kind of calling

00:26:56,090 --> 00:26:59,629
through the content and making sure the

00:26:58,249 --> 00:27:01,429
tags are appropriately I think there's

00:26:59,629 --> 00:27:03,139
this idea if I pick all the tags and the

00:27:01,429 --> 00:27:05,090
content type my opportunity will get

00:27:03,139 --> 00:27:06,590
really good marketing which then as you

00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:08,359
know makes the integrity of the site not

00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:10,549
so good so there is somebody who's

00:27:08,359 --> 00:27:13,429
looking at that we're having them they

00:27:10,549 --> 00:27:15,259
have two options the global folks one we

00:27:13,429 --> 00:27:17,239
had a feed a one-time feed come over

00:27:15,259 --> 00:27:19,429
from Tara data to pull in all of their

00:27:17,239 --> 00:27:21,230
opportunities and then what we did is we

00:27:19,429 --> 00:27:22,909
kind of put them in a staging spot

00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:24,499
let them go clean them up using our

00:27:22,909 --> 00:27:26,659
content type and then put them on the

00:27:24,499 --> 00:27:29,239
site now they're managing them just on

00:27:26,659 --> 00:27:32,869
the Drupal side we did an integration

00:27:29,239 --> 00:27:34,580
also with our class roster it's a little

00:27:32,869 --> 00:27:36,529
weird but we have opportunities that are

00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:38,210
also courses so they're specifically

00:27:36,529 --> 00:27:39,470
tagged ones in the roster that we're now

00:27:38,210 --> 00:27:41,480
pulling over doing the same thing

00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:43,009
bringing them to staging letting them

00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:44,509
pretty them up and then they get put on

00:27:43,009 --> 00:27:46,940
the site and then you have all the hand

00:27:44,509 --> 00:27:50,149
entered ones there's some really good

00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:51,710
use case studies it's almost like you

00:27:50,149 --> 00:27:54,080
know if my friend has something cool now

00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:55,609
I want it to we're seeing some of the

00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:57,529
communications directors sit in these

00:27:55,609 --> 00:27:59,570
meetings and if one says you know I went

00:27:57,529 --> 00:28:01,700
using this from 50 application

00:27:59,570 --> 00:28:03,470
applicants to now getting 200 and

00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:04,940
somebody else hears that then all of a

00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:07,279
sudden they want to put their you know

00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:09,320
there's stuff here and use it do you

00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:13,149
have a continuing feed from Tara data or

00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:13,149
does this replace Tarragona replace

00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:19,830
I don't know if this question is on

00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:22,020
anybody else's mind but it seems that

00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:25,560
each student when applying for an

00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:27,030
opportunity they require the use of a

00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:29,840
login into Salesforce

00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:32,850
how did Cornell University manage the

00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:34,320
licensing for Salesforce in that

00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:38,040
situation because it could be quite

00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:41,160
expensive has a community license and

00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:43,200
it's a login model so you just buy

00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:44,010
enough logins and it's actually not that

00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,110
expensive

00:28:44,010 --> 00:28:48,960
I think Salesforce has a reputation of

00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:51,630
being very expensive it can be you have

00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:53,820
to know how to buy the licenses and how

00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:55,710
to structure them but in the end that is

00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:57,210
not the most expensive part of owning

00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:59,130
Salesforce it's much more about hiring

00:28:57,210 --> 00:29:01,440
vendors to get it stood up and get the

00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:03,660
data model in place and all that so the

00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:05,220
licensing I find pretty reasonable and

00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:07,260
especially when I look at the cost of

00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:09,990
all these point solutions that we're now

00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:12,210
able to retire you know the cost of an

00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:14,670
ERP Salesforce is a lot less than that

00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:16,110
so so it's you know it's it is a new

00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:18,750
class of technology and it's an

00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:20,990
investment but but the community sides

00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:33,180
specifically that is a reasonable price

00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:38,220
thank you so we recently implemented a

00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:40,470
similar system and I'm I'm wondering now

00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:42,570
if it's something that is a common

00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:43,650
initiative that a lot of because I've

00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:48,080
been hearing about it at other

00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:51,930
universities to this when we did our UX

00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:53,610
we had difficulty because the students

00:29:51,930 --> 00:29:56,340
and the participants had difficulty kind

00:29:53,610 --> 00:29:57,750
of wrapping their heads around what was

00:29:56,340 --> 00:30:01,920
gonna be involved in how they could

00:29:57,750 --> 00:30:03,480
benefit from it we kind of took an

00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:05,640
approach where it was kind of more

00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:07,560
iterative where we created the interface

00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:11,130
and then we've been improving it over

00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:13,680
time and because of that we identified

00:30:11,130 --> 00:30:17,400
one of the motivators for our audience

00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:20,040
members was that they're looking for our

00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:23,790
students in particular are looking for a

00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:26,160
way to improve their skill sets with

00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:27,810
these soft skills that will allow them

00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:28,450
to have opportunities in their careers

00:30:27,810 --> 00:30:31,390
so

00:30:28,450 --> 00:30:33,280
want to have some kind of kind of hard

00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:36,820
copy I guess of of what they've

00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:40,180
completed I'm so media identified groups

00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:43,620
of opportunities based on these skill

00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:46,630
sets so for example there's a leadership

00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:49,300
area and I noticed you don't have that

00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:51,510
and I have sometimes wondered if because

00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:53,560
we're presenting them as these

00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:55,870
navigation groups that are based on

00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:57,400
these soft skills if we're keeping them

00:30:55,870 --> 00:30:59,530
from discovering things I see on your

00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:00,700
site you have like a filtering option

00:30:59,530 --> 00:31:03,670
where you can allow them to identify

00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:05,830
have you ever thought or do you do you

00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:07,450
have any plans to update anything about

00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:09,760
that filtering because it seems very

00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:12,340
simple to me right now based on what the

00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:14,980
opportunities are yeah so there's a lot

00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:16,900
in that that idea of those sort of a

00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:18,760
co-curricular transcript is something

00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:22,690
that we feel now equipped to be able to

00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:25,030
deliver on the filter side I will say

00:31:22,690 --> 00:31:27,760
that has been the biggest win of this is

00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:29,590
you know getting so many people in the

00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:32,620
university to align around the filters

00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:35,350
in a very simple way and so leadership

00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:38,130
we have a feature filter and so we could

00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:41,350
and probably at some point we'll add

00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:44,290
leadership as a component of a one of

00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:46,330
the tags we wouldn't put that as the

00:31:44,290 --> 00:31:48,460
type because I think we tried to be a

00:31:46,330 --> 00:31:52,030
little more like you mentioned soft

00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:53,350
skills we looked to align with the kinds

00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:57,250
of things that students want to do

00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:59,020
research or study abroad and then or a

00:31:57,250 --> 00:32:01,390
volunteer opportunity and then there's

00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:04,980
leadership components to it so we sort

00:32:01,390 --> 00:32:07,330
of flipped it I like the simplicity

00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:09,520
it'll be interesting for us I'm thinking

00:32:07,330 --> 00:32:11,920
oh maybe we'll do some comparison

00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:14,290
testing with our audience groups to see

00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:16,660
that's great it's a live site so

00:32:14,290 --> 00:32:18,550
experienced at Cornell dot edu you can

00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:21,100
all see it I mean that filters have

00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:23,170
changed endlessly since we started and

00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:25,690
one interesting tidbit from the students

00:32:23,170 --> 00:32:27,970
was they don't use all the filters

00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:30,010
either and so they really wanted it kept

00:32:27,970 --> 00:32:31,930
simple in the six big boxes you see on

00:32:30,010 --> 00:32:34,750
the front we did testing with three

00:32:31,930 --> 00:32:39,120
verses six versus nine versus more six

00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:39,120
was across the board like the sweet spot

00:32:39,730 --> 00:32:48,920
check one more quick questions for you

00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:50,270
are you using Drupal 7 or 8 a and what

00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:56,530
single sign-on solution are you

00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:56,530
implementing sam'l sam'l so it's kind of

00:32:57,850 --> 00:33:02,780
Eila because they're using the module

00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:07,970
but I don't know if they customized

00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:10,010
around that so thank you everybody we're

00:33:07,970 --> 00:33:11,390
gonna camp out outside the room so if

00:33:10,010 --> 00:33:12,950
anybody has more questions we're happy

00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:19,759
to chat thank you

00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:19,759
