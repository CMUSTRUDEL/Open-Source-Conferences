Title: DrupalCon Seattle 2019: Case Study: The Student Experience Comes to Life
Publication date: 2019-04-12
Playlist: Drupalcon Seattle 2019
Description: 
	Join us for a rich discussion on technology and student engagement. Cornell University offers thousands of opportunities beyond the classroom – study abroad, community-engaged learning, research, scholarships, professional development and more. The problem is that for every program, there’s a website. It’s a technology ecosystem that is expensive, silo’d, and hard to navigate. One student compared Cornell to a “treasure hunt” saying students feel lucky when they find things. During this session, attendees will learn how Cornell overcame this challenge (and many others) by blending CRM, and Drupal into an accessible and personalized system of engagement. We will share a demo and key learnings from our multi-year implementation and our formula for success in improving the student experience.
