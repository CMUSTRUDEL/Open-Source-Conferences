Title: DrupalCon Seattle 2019: Scaling Community Decision-making
Publication date: 2019-04-12
Playlist: Drupalcon Seattle 2019
Description: 
	Any Free/Libre Open Source Software project will have elements of do-ocracy (rule of those who do the work) but not all decisions should devolve to implementors. Rather, a basic principle is that decisions should be made by the people who are most affected.

Particularly when a decision strongly affects more than those who carry it out, therefore, we need better ways of making decisions that give everyone their say. This starts by letting people by heard by everyone else. Fortunately, we can scale conversations and decisions in a fair and truly democratic way.

Learn why meritocracy ("rule of those with merit") is a completely bogus and harmful concept.
Gain a passing familiarity with various ways decisions are or have been made in Drupal.
Add sociocracy and sortition to your vocabulary and understand how these esoteric concepts can help our community scale.
See how Drutopia is putting more democratic decision-making approaches into practice.
The most important things we have to do need to be done together. And our work together is most powerful when we make decisions about it together.

while Mickey bribes the crowd I will get

00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:17,910
started is that time we are talking

00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:22,550
about scaling community conversations

00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:27,529
and decision making I am Ben Nelson and

00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:32,160
Mickey Metz is out giving out candy and

00:00:27,529 --> 00:00:33,800
we are with the agaric we are we are

00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:39,620
with dark where worker owned cooperative

00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:45,300
which means we do make democratic

00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:46,800
decisions internally but we most of this

00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:49,410
presentation will not be drawing on our

00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,870
own experiences because it's about

00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:54,090
democracy at scale and decision-making

00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:59,550
at scale and we are a cooperative of six

00:00:54,090 --> 00:01:02,699
people just so what where we're coming

00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:06,150
from of sort of a founding principle for

00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:08,400
our our cooperative and you know in our

00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:10,530
lives is having the most power possible

00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,510
to all you know giving the most power

00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:15,810
possible to all people over their own

00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:17,939
lives and you know from doing websites

00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:19,710
that people can actually edit and you

00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:21,869
know online and our free software so

00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:24,540
they can do whatever they want with is

00:01:21,869 --> 00:01:26,220
important and you know these are the

00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:28,200
concepts of justice and liberty which I

00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:29,340
like to say that's pretty to say but

00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,560
it's hard to make sure you're talking

00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:33,689
about the same thing that you know

00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:35,549
justice and liberty can be very flowery

00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:37,650
and squishy and there's whole you know

00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:40,140
terrible economists who make a career of

00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:41,460
arguing that you know liberty is the

00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:43,320
freedom for someone to do whatever they

00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:46,470
want with their own property no matter

00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:51,149
if other people are being completely

00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:53,670
denied any freedom because of that so we

00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:56,399
are talking about group decision making

00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:58,829
and basic thesis of that we're going to

00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:01,530
get to is that group decision making

00:01:58,829 --> 00:02:03,000
requires conversation to influence the

00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:06,479
decision you need to be part of the

00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,039
conversation conversations with a large

00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:10,289
number of people need to be moderated

00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:11,690
and if you don't have equal access to

00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:13,160
the conversation of

00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:15,080
fair share that is a fair share of

00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:20,210
control over the moderation you don't

00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:23,900
have equal say in the decision so power

00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:26,420
is organization we are developers and

00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:29,870
designers and are fairly famously in our

00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:33,740
own self-conception hard to organize you

00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:35,870
may have seen the slide or just hard

00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:39,290
people likening managing developers and

00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:41,270
designers to herding cats but doesn't

00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:43,220
change the fact that you know our power

00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:45,470
in our community is the level of

00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:48,590
organization we've achieved sometimes

00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:50,720
through the code and so just knowledge

00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:53,530
is not power as mayor and keba

00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:56,150
great organizer and prison abolitionist

00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:57,680
you've been working for yeah

00:02:56,150 --> 00:03:00,050
transformative justice for a long time

00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:03,290
says it's you know organization is power

00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:04,730
not not simply knowledge which is why

00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:13,270
we're talking about how to work together

00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:16,700
as community so inevitably in any any

00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:19,700
any movement any formation of people

00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:22,640
inevitably there's going to be informal

00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:24,650
communication networks and so Joe

00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:29,180
Freeman wrote about this in nineteen in

00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:31,310
the 1970s in in the context of the

00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:34,940
women's liberation movement in our

00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:36,380
resources slide which you'll well we

00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:38,150
link to at the end so don't worry about

00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:43,790
any citations or notes we'll all be

00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:45,080
online you know I I've just taken her

00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:47,239
quotes about the women's liberation

00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:49,550
movement and just put in the open source

00:03:47,239 --> 00:03:51,920
software movement as a thing and it just

00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:56,750
reads exactly the same but the point is

00:03:51,920 --> 00:04:00,110
that inevitably in formal communication

00:03:56,750 --> 00:04:02,600
networks of friends are elitist and

00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:04,340
exclusive and so that for everyone to

00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:06,530
have an opportunity to be involved in a

00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:08,480
given group and to participate in the XX

00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:11,900
in it in its activities the structure

00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:13,580
must be explicit not implicit that's why

00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:15,230
we're talking about it and then sort of

00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:17,000
the weakest reason for having some form

00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:18,830
of democratic governance is still a

00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,840
pretty big one it's people having a

00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:24,110
feeling of influence of being heard

00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:24,920
which not going to just go around the

00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:26,000
room and ask but is

00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:28,430
been something that's been on the

00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,110
decline and the wane in in the Drupal

00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:33,380
community not feeling a lot of control

00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:39,890
so going to Drupal Drupal is not a

00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:43,640
democracy having a benevolent dictator

00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:48,140
for life model you know doesn't work so

00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:51,200
a Neji Rogers of chocolate lily has

00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:55,010
involved in the Drupal Association when

00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:58,280
it started in Europe and proposed that

00:04:55,010 --> 00:05:03,580
it have a genuinely democratic structure

00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:09,820
and that didn't happen and you know like

00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:09,820
12 you know 15 years later we are still

00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:18,830
that long we are we are still having

00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:21,650
those effects so the the Drupal

00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:25,100
governance task force which did a lot of

00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:27,770
work over end of 2017 and and three to

00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:33,320
the end of 2018 their very first

00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:35,810
recommendation is begins having a be DFL

00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:38,540
model been a benevolent dictator for

00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:41,270
life model means loyalty time and

00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:43,100
attention are divided there is often

00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:45,350
frustration is pressure for change and

00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:46,670
decisions reach an individual bottleneck

00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:48,020
there is a strong feeling that any

00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:50,990
community change or action requires

00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:53,270
Greece's approval before commencing let

00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:54,620
alone expanding the project is bigger

00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:56,210
than one individual it's time to

00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:59,090
recognize that and place a community

00:05:56,210 --> 00:06:01,700
group at the center and this is a group

00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:05,990
that was authorized and chosen by the

00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:07,640
reefs but yeah that suggestion hasn't

00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:09,860
gone anywhere in the five months since

00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:11,510
it was made so it's sort of been the

00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:14,120
same thing it's and they they talk about

00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:15,800
this a lot in their report that you know

00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:18,560
people don't want to put a lot of work

00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:21,020
into improving governance if you don't

00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,550
feel that it's it's going to get

00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:25,550
somewhere it's one of the the least

00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:30,010
returns so what has triple been doing

00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:35,480
and how has it been running its

00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:37,070
decision-making internally so the one of

00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:38,930
the things we have going for ourselves I

00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:42,020
feel is that we

00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:44,810
do not generally self-identify as a

00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:46,760
meritocracy which is a start because the

00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:49,520
word meritocracy comes from a political

00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:51,170
satire it was never meant to be

00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,240
something we should aspire to the

00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:56,840
opposite a warning about how we

00:06:53,240 --> 00:07:00,350
rationalize what we believe we've earned

00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:02,390
and if that sentence doesn't seem

00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:03,890
applicable to you in the tech industry

00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:06,470
and it's cyclic live discussion and

00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:08,930
sexist and racism and occasionally

00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:11,540
classism even gets talked about please

00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:16,280
read Guerin means blog post that I took

00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:22,550
that from and then you know just cartoon

00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:24,650
about how the the Institute the effects

00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:28,430
of institutional racism and every other

00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:30,830
sort of institutional and continuing

00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:32,570
thing doesn't just go away and that if

00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:36,380
we as a community are at all serious

00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:41,360
about fairness it means looking beyond

00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:43,130
what you know we you know what it means

00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,720
doing a little bit of our part to make

00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:46,220
the world more just which isn't just

00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:49,100
saying that oh well in our community

00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:50,510
we're not going to discriminate it means

00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:52,520
that we actually have to go farther and

00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:56,570
and work towards justice and try to

00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:58,850
bring resources to those who don't and

00:07:56,570 --> 00:08:00,470
also community of equals needs with the

00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:03,530
non hierarchical method of communication

00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:05,180
needs to control harassment or you will

00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:06,350
slam your computer and go away and we

00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:10,550
lose lots of other people and that's

00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:13,180
another thing that especially the need

00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:17,990
feminism discussion of meritocracy

00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:21,230
covers so we identify a little bit more

00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:24,500
as a duoc recei angie byron likes to use

00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:27,080
the term democracy I'm really proud that

00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:29,810
I suggested it stealing from other

00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:33,050
communities back in like 2008

00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:35,750
but the idea is that you know you can

00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:38,750
you know the decisions are mostly made

00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:41,450
actually by people who just step up and

00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:43,610
do something and so I actually want to

00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:44,750
so anyhow so half of all open-source

00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:48,460
projects have only one committer

00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:51,040
according to hola and I don't have I

00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:53,140
don't have a

00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:56,050
and the numbers for Drupal modules but I

00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:59,050
think it's similar like vast majority

00:08:56,050 --> 00:09:00,250
will be one active maintainer and these

00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:01,690
projects don't have to worry about

00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:04,510
scaling community decision-making

00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:06,940
there's one decision-maker maybe two

00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:09,400
and that's actually fantastic you know

00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:11,980
as you know there's a bad side of like

00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:14,020
that seems like you know that's not the

00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:16,480
community power we generally think about

00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:18,580
but the good thing is that anything you

00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,050
can do entirely on your own is something

00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:23,200
that you can just go and do and so

00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:24,850
Drupal's modular architecture has has

00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,310
been what's enabled to have such a large

00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:29,620
community without having strong

00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:33,130
decision-making tools and that's and

00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:35,560
that so it's not the idea that and this

00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:37,600
is not like surprising to us a network

00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:40,690
or uncooperative like we don't take

00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:43,000
everything to a democratic vote whoever

00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:45,220
is most affected or and it has the most

00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:49,840
skill goes ahead and and makes the

00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:51,190
decision so I do want to emphasize that

00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:54,420
a large part of drupelets

00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:56,740
decision-making has been solved by

00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:58,600
devolving and I mean I should also

00:09:56,740 --> 00:10:02,230
mention that in free software the

00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:04,120
ultimate op you know freedom is to fork

00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:06,160
you know that's the point of free

00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:07,750
software and that the backdrop community

00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,910
has done this and in fact has really

00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:11,500
interesting governance of their own like

00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:15,130
so they forked a community as well as

00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:18,340
the code and and are a place to look for

00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:25,960
for governance so you know the the

00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:27,400
inherent freedom in in free software has

00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:29,410
already been exercised in Drupal and

00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:32,320
it's it's no longer just theoretical

00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:33,610
about you know how how do you still have

00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,310
the freedom to make decisions it's

00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:37,960
actually happened so you know that

00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:42,190
that's that's an important structural

00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:45,880
thing underlying our community also but

00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:48,130
there's still lots of matters where we

00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:50,700
have the need to make collective

00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:54,450
decisions and the good news is that

00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:56,500
despite you know many talking about how

00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:58,210
participated democracy and social

00:10:56,500 --> 00:11:00,340
equality can only work in a small

00:10:58,210 --> 00:11:03,490
community or activist group historically

00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:04,340
I'm quoting David Graeber and David one

00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:05,810
grow

00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:09,080
on how to change the course of human

00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:11,450
history is that egalitarian cities and

00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:13,610
regional confederacies are historically

00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:15,860
quite commonplace and actually Galtieri

00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:18,970
and families and households are not and

00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:22,810
this is the Iroquois Confederacy which

00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:26,029
very large very horizontal Confederacy

00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:29,150
other historical examples one of the

00:11:26,029 --> 00:11:31,880
major problems of there are several

00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:34,640
major problems with governing people is

00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:37,190
whom you get to do it or rather who

00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:39,950
manages to get people to let them do it

00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:41,870
to them and this is douglas adams to

00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:43,490
summarize this is a well-known fact that

00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:46,430
those people who must want to rule

00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:46,910
people are if so fact those least seeded

00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:48,770
to do it

00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:50,540
to summarize the summary anyone who is

00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:52,370
capable of getting themselves made ruler

00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:55,460
president should on no account be

00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:56,720
allowed to do the job and summarize the

00:11:55,460 --> 00:12:04,370
summary of the summary people are the

00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:06,170
problem so the good news is that people

00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:08,120
are problematic in sort of consistent

00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:09,589
ways and there's all sorts of things we

00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:11,180
can do to make ourselves better and so

00:12:09,589 --> 00:12:13,130
this is the point where systems matter

00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:14,990
is you can never just say at the

00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:17,810
individual level and so it's not the

00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:18,920
problem of who is a benevolent dictator

00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:20,510
for life the problem is having a

00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:23,360
benevolent dictator for life structure

00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:25,850
or you know in anything else the problem

00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,440
is generally not the people it's how

00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:30,620
we've set up the systems for how people

00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:36,170
work and so we touch on a few tiny

00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:39,100
subsets of you know regular problems

00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:41,990
that people have and how to fix that so

00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:43,760
one of the basic problems is that no one

00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:47,200
cares about decision making processes

00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:47,200
until there's something they don't like

00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:54,560
so we're just going to talk about you

00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:56,360
know what kind of democracy what kind of

00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:59,720
community decision making do we want in

00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:03,410
place for when there is a problem you

00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:05,959
know for inspiration the Zapatista

00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:08,650
Caracol networks is sort of a modern one

00:13:05,959 --> 00:13:09,950
that's taking lots of inspiration from

00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:12,080
long-standing

00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:17,000
indigenous communities in southern

00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:17,630
Mexico and has some similarities to some

00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,680
of the stuff which

00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:23,690
as far as being very clear about nested

00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:26,210
levels of this is making in Spears of

00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:27,740
influence but we might as well just

00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:34,310
don't have much time here get straight

00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:36,170
to the tools so loomio is a tool that

00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:42,140
makes democratic decision-making yeah

00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:45,290
makes loomio is in a cooperative and

00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:47,930
they've just designed a wonderful tool

00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:52,010
for decision-making that allows everyone

00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:53,930
to either vote on it yes or no or to

00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:57,410
decide that they need more information

00:13:53,930 --> 00:14:00,020
before they can vote so it opens up a

00:13:57,410 --> 00:14:04,310
way you can discuss in a nonlinear

00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:06,710
fashion and it because it's difficult

00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:09,020
how large can a group be before the

00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:11,690
design and format must change to

00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:13,810
accommodate a larger group the process

00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:16,310
for eight people to make a decision is

00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:18,320
wildly different than a process for

00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:21,350
eight hundred thousand people to make a

00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:24,740
decision or for a whole community that

00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:29,660
is a city to make a decision together

00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:32,630
so it must be modified and you have to

00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:35,270
realize when to modify that format when

00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:37,690
is it getting so exhaustive and complex

00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:41,810
that no one can understand the system

00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:43,250
that is a real pitfall because people

00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:49,730
don't usually tell you that they just

00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:53,750
leave loomio org and that that's in our

00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:55,370
resources links also and the people who

00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:56,810
made loomio will be the first to tell

00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:59,030
you that there aren't technological

00:14:56,810 --> 00:15:00,860
fixes for human problems they have a

00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:03,740
great cooperative handbook and they're

00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:06,440
part of the Inspiral network which is a

00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:08,210
bunch of cooperatives many of them

00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:10,490
cooperatives the network itself is not

00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:12,680
formally cooperative but that tries to

00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:14,810
solve a lot of communication making

00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:16,250
problems and they you know the builders

00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:21,890
of this software actually feel that it's

00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:23,870
you know best for you know groups of you

00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:28,490
know basically more than 10 and less

00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:30,080
than 100 and so one of the questions you

00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:30,970
know is you know when you have a large

00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:33,339
community is

00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:36,339
is how do you make decisions and

00:15:33,339 --> 00:15:38,829
harkening back to douglas adams and you

00:15:36,339 --> 00:15:42,610
know so Walt Kelly who always had his

00:15:38,829 --> 00:15:44,379
cartoon character declare that he wasn't

00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:47,139
didn't want to be present so that made

00:15:44,379 --> 00:15:48,279
everyone else want to make him elect

00:15:47,139 --> 00:15:50,500
them every whatever yeah

00:15:48,279 --> 00:15:52,899
even more so that every four years a

00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:54,370
series of cartoons about everyone else

00:15:52,899 --> 00:15:56,980
trying to get him elected well he tried

00:15:54,370 --> 00:16:01,300
to hide you know going to that there is

00:15:56,980 --> 00:16:03,339
a well-established approach to making

00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:06,970
sure that those who seek power are not

00:16:03,339 --> 00:16:09,699
the ones you give power and the ancient

00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:11,680
Greeks parent turned out thought about

00:16:09,699 --> 00:16:14,259
this and acted on it and it's called

00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:17,500
sortition in modern terms is usually

00:16:14,259 --> 00:16:21,339
meant taking from the group of people in

00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:23,980
a community just a random selection of

00:16:21,339 --> 00:16:27,850
them and giving them the time and the

00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:30,939
resources to make decisions on behalf of

00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:32,939
the community so it's it's not you know

00:16:30,939 --> 00:16:36,449
whoever happens to volunteer it's

00:16:32,939 --> 00:16:39,910
actually a random selection and then

00:16:36,449 --> 00:16:41,559
giving people the skills and the time

00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:44,649
and the resources to make decisions and

00:16:41,559 --> 00:16:47,620
then at some point you know in a set

00:16:44,649 --> 00:16:48,730
time you change that and it's got a lot

00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:51,490
of good approaches to reducing

00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:53,920
corruption a lot of good things for

00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:55,750
making sure you're inclusive and not

00:16:53,920 --> 00:17:00,339
just you know taking the people who have

00:16:55,750 --> 00:17:04,079
the most time and resources and another

00:17:00,339 --> 00:17:11,049
application of yeah so the same idea is

00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:13,449
you know just the technical hack to have

00:17:11,049 --> 00:17:15,789
us let us have large genuinely free and

00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:17,709
fair communities is to have a randomly

00:17:15,789 --> 00:17:19,750
selected group of people make decision

00:17:17,709 --> 00:17:21,400
on whether a particular message should

00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:24,520
be pushed out to the whole group so sort

00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:26,230
of sortition light in the sense that you

00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:27,549
know it's not a lot of time and

00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:30,340
resources you're giving people but

00:17:27,549 --> 00:17:36,150
you're just sharing the work of deciding

00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:38,260
what communication goes out that's

00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:40,240
fundamental level and we're gonna try to

00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:41,820
go quickly so there's time for questions

00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:44,279
here

00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:46,049
and visions a night which is a project

00:17:44,279 --> 00:17:48,149
that I'm part of will be an incubator

00:17:46,049 --> 00:17:50,100
and ongoing communication tool set for

00:17:48,149 --> 00:17:53,490
all kinds of cooperative ventures that

00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:55,529
need or want to scale and want that you

00:17:53,490 --> 00:18:00,960
know kind of put the community in charge

00:17:55,529 --> 00:18:03,870
of the the communication aspect of

00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:22,200
things so it was the precursor to being

00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:25,470
able to have scale so and then another

00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:28,110
sort of modern twist on some of these

00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:30,480
ancient things of idea of nesting and

00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:32,390
there's done a good job of defining it

00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:36,360
and I think is a really good fit for

00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:43,200
volunteer heavy projects like Drupal in

00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:45,029
that it's it's a lot easier - yeah - you

00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,289
know when when you're a company or

00:18:45,029 --> 00:18:50,429
something it's like everyone's being

00:18:46,289 --> 00:18:52,950
paid everyone has time and so you sort

00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:56,070
of so CRC is basically sort of a balance

00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:59,159
between the or has potential for

00:18:56,070 --> 00:19:03,450
balancing between the self-selected

00:18:59,159 --> 00:19:05,669
aspect of bureaucracy and having some

00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:09,330
sort of representative democratic

00:19:05,669 --> 00:19:10,830
control so it's just a structure you

00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:12,899
know and emphasizes learning and

00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:15,299
evolving cleared just decisions and then

00:19:12,899 --> 00:19:18,570
a fractal circle structure which is is

00:19:15,299 --> 00:19:20,850
sort of the key to evolving power and

00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:24,179
also you know anyone actually doing the

00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:25,320
implementing has that control so

00:19:24,179 --> 00:19:27,570
everyone gets a say in the direction

00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:28,890
condition of their work and you know no

00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:30,899
one else gets say they're just following

00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:33,450
orders the structure is a bunch of

00:19:30,899 --> 00:19:36,360
circles each linked to one or more other

00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:38,909
circles by a double link side you know

00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:40,559
groups connected there's in each group

00:19:38,909 --> 00:19:43,320
one person is a representative to

00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:44,640
another group and not every group has to

00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:46,320
be connected only groups that generally

00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:49,679
have to work together and each group

00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:52,440
makes its own decisions and then you

00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:54,809
know it goes to others and so it's not

00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:55,440
like a pure hierarchy it's whichever

00:19:54,809 --> 00:19:57,480
groups

00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:59,550
in their work relationships have to work

00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:02,550
together all decisions made within

00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:04,500
circles are made by consent which is a

00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:06,240
term they use for consensus and it's

00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:09,210
basically the same thing but they want

00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:12,990
to emphasize that not everyone you know

00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:14,700
has to be in chart you know in in

00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:17,490
agreement with the collective decision

00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:19,470
they're just not going to block it but

00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:23,550
as developers we need to understand that

00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:26,550
the decisions need to include the people

00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:29,510
who will be using this software or

00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:33,600
whatever it is that you're building

00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:36,000
without them you're just back to a

00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:38,910
hierarchy of telling people what to do

00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:42,180
so setting up the structure for everyone

00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:48,210
to be able to participate is important

00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:50,100
ongoing discussion exactly has anyone

00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:54,330
heard of the platform cooperativism

00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:56,130
movement no there's a handbook about it

00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:58,770
it's about building platforms that are

00:20:56,130 --> 00:21:03,780
owned by the people that use them like

00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:06,600
an uber owned by the drivers and this is

00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:09,540
definitely a way of getting everyone to

00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:17,310
put in their their ideas because the

00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:20,340
platform is used by all so recently the

00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:22,530
platform cooperative movement has gotten

00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:25,470
a million dollar grant to create a

00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:28,380
toolkit co-op a platform cooperative

00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:30,750
toolkit which does include some software

00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:32,790
but it's mostly the resources a person

00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:34,370
would need to start a platform like

00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:36,660
their um

00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:39,450
finding out about local government

00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:43,110
structures what forms do they need to

00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:45,360
fill what legal aid will they need those

00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:47,640
type of things that are scattered you

00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:49,710
know they're all publicly available but

00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:54,620
it's so scattered it would take you

00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:54,620
maybe months to organize that

00:21:55,380 --> 00:22:03,790
yeah yeah exactly

00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:05,380
I mean a corollary of making sure that

00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:08,140
everyone gets to be heard from is that

00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:09,640
not ever decision it's one that everyone

00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:14,140
needs to weigh you know and also that

00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:16,360
you need to actively include that yeah

00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:18,460
users and the platform Crocker movement

00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:20,860
provides an approach to that yes all day

00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:22,840
long people technologists are demanding

00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:25,000
that people use our software use the

00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:26,890
software but I don't see anyone telling

00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:30,100
everyone to go meet their neighbors and

00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:34,720
find out what they need which is where

00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:35,560
it should start from from the

00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,600
co-operative movement

00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:39,310
David hammer States so if we're not

00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:41,230
focused on building things that scale

00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:42,940
we're not building institutions that

00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:44,410
change society and we're not building

00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:46,660
institutions that change society we're

00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:49,480
not doing what we need to do with this

00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:51,850
historical moment in time so that's why

00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:54,960
we're both involved with utopia which is

00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:58,180
like five people involved grander ideas

00:22:54,960 --> 00:23:00,570
and it has all kinds of big decisions to

00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:03,700
make and all that much structure yet so

00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:05,350
secret plan to rule the world build a

00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:07,540
web you know forge Autopia is build a

00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:09,700
platform serving sites for grassroots

00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:11,500
groups use the revenue to build make it

00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:13,840
the best platform and use that revenue

00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:17,500
to build a powerful communication

00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:20,170
network under Democratic control but you

00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:23,970
know that's side project and there's

00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:23,970
lots of really exciting projects and

00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:31,540
Micky talks about the building blocks of

00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:33,310
freedom free software Crofton platform

00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:38,350
solidarity economy and personal power

00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:41,650
but will yeah without personal power

00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:44,170
none of this will work if you don't

00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:46,750
encourage other people to gain their

00:23:44,170 --> 00:23:49,330
personal power they will not be putting

00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:52,510
in their vote they will be abstaining

00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:55,090
usually or like on the fringe of this so

00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:57,790
that's most important to encourage

00:23:55,090 --> 00:24:00,760
people to get their own personal power

00:23:57,790 --> 00:24:03,380
and to be able to use it and that takes

00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:05,880
a group effort

00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:08,160
yeah and so we see just intersections

00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:09,540
between like our free software

00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:11,280
communities and all these other groups

00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:13,860
that are working for a more just world

00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:15,500
and ultimately a more you know giving

00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:18,240
people more power for their own lives

00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:20,730
and there's a lot of exciting work in

00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:32,480
the Solidarity economy too but yes we

00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:36,900
will go to questions questions yes sure

00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:39,210
it's being recorded so and we can't

00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:40,860
forget those without internet access to

00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:42,600
in this whole thing so we don't have

00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:46,200
time to talk about it but please think

00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:48,690
that hi West from third and Grove I'm

00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:50,280
just curious because some other open

00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:53,520
source projects have kind of a

00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:56,610
commercial structure and then the open

00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:58,290
source version what are some of the pros

00:24:56,610 --> 00:25:03,510
and cons of that approach for an open

00:24:58,290 --> 00:25:06,810
source project revenue streams are

00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:10,620
really great but usually that that

00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:12,960
bifurcates things so you essentially you

00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:15,150
know have a commercial project that is

00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:18,930
not accountable to the community that's

00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:20,070
that's controlling things so yeah what

00:25:18,930 --> 00:25:21,510
we're really talking about is how to

00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:23,070
have you know with the platform

00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:24,480
cooperatives is how to have a revenue

00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:29,040
stream that he is accountable to the

00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:31,500
community and yeah Drupal is I think

00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:33,000
it's better off and not having you know

00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:35,040
in the in that you could like take out

00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,510
the top ten companies as big and

00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:37,980
concentrate as many mergers we do you

00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:40,230
could take out top ten companies and

00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:43,290
there's still be a huge Drupal ecosystem

00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:45,240
and that's very very few projects of any

00:25:43,290 --> 00:25:47,460
kind that can say that so I think we

00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:49,590
actually benefit from the fact that it

00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:53,070
we didn't start with that model Driss

00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:55,740
was a PhD student couldn't start a

00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:58,050
company for the first six years or so of

00:25:55,740 --> 00:26:00,360
Drupal and and we grew this huge

00:25:58,050 --> 00:26:02,370
ecosystem you know before there was

00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:04,110
aqueous so as much as you know some

00:26:02,370 --> 00:26:06,000
people outside Drupal think of aqua

00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:08,070
equals Drupal people in Drupal don't

00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:11,430
really think of that because we we were

00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:13,500
familiar with it and so yeah just real

00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:15,330
quickly you know Drupal is this

00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:15,780
interesting thing is that so that you

00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:19,860
know

00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:22,470
three is you know he has control of the

00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:24,929
code and you know tries to separate that

00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:26,539
from his role of a taqueria and again I

00:26:24,929 --> 00:26:28,950
think he does that better than anybody

00:26:26,539 --> 00:26:32,610
could but it's just not something that

00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:34,650
structurally you should have and then

00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:36,210
the Drupal Association you know which

00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:37,530
you sort of think of as representing the

00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:43,140
community actually has sort of this

00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:45,030
narrow charter to handle so the events

00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:48,020
and some of the infrastructure stuff and

00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:50,429
they have no influence over the code so

00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:53,940
you know we sort of have like sort of a

00:26:50,429 --> 00:26:56,280
hole in in sort of the heart of what we

00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:58,289
would have which where some other things

00:26:56,280 --> 00:27:01,020
would have a very similar splittin that

00:26:58,289 --> 00:27:02,730
they'd have the Drupal Association and

00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:04,409
then they just have a company basically

00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:06,090
that's making most decisions about the

00:27:04,409 --> 00:27:07,890
code and we have something that's sort

00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:11,370
of similar but it's a little bit you

00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:12,990
know we we don't we keep it you know

00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:16,049
conceptually separate you know it's not

00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:18,030
a company it's as an individual who then

00:27:16,049 --> 00:27:22,799
appoints the people who have a final say

00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:24,600
over the code yes I wanted to say I

00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:27,960
really liked how you how you put it all

00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:29,909
together things so beginning of the year

00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:31,890
started to work for a company where we

00:27:29,909 --> 00:27:34,679
use holacracy which is kind of saying

00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:37,100
similar so social cracy but a license

00:27:34,679 --> 00:27:40,320
model and what I really like is that

00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:42,240
with the content over consensus approach

00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:45,150
we can really take decisions fast and

00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:47,070
where where they matter do you see us in

00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:49,590
the trooper community being able to

00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:52,470
implement such practices or what what

00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:54,659
would be your roadmap to to get better

00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:56,580
at those practices one of the things

00:27:54,659 --> 00:27:59,549
that we're doing in Boston is there's a

00:27:56,580 --> 00:28:02,580
wonderful group called Ujima the Ujima

00:27:59,549 --> 00:28:04,890
project is working to revitalize areas

00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:07,020
of town that have gone crazy in the

00:28:04,890 --> 00:28:09,330
front and they're working with community

00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:10,919
members to actually rate the businesses

00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:12,780
as to whether they're good for the

00:28:10,919 --> 00:28:15,539
community or not good for the community

00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:18,720
so this is a practice that should be put

00:28:15,539 --> 00:28:20,490
in place in every community where you

00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:22,950
are looking at are there extractive

00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:25,530
businesses taking stuff out of the

00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:28,070
community or are they putting in so

00:28:25,530 --> 00:28:30,650
engaging with people who are not Drupal

00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:32,270
or anything nothing to do with Drupal

00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:36,770
but it that are in your local government

00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:39,620
structure is extremely important well

00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:42,800
yeah the Solidarity economy and so that

00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:45,080
we do tree to do business with those

00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:48,140
that are doing good for the community

00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:52,190
and the extractive businesses we talk to

00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:53,090
them I I do see that yeah like Mickey

00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:54,500
said that some of our better

00:28:53,090 --> 00:28:57,200
opportunities are probably outside of

00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:58,880
Drupal mostly though I think that you

00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:01,880
know we don't have a lot of governments

00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:05,570
defined this is a democracy moment where

00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:09,140
you know any individual project within

00:29:05,570 --> 00:29:10,850
Drupal can try to do that so you know

00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:12,380
with age or topia project we're building

00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:14,390
on Drupal 8 we're not forking the

00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:16,640
software but we're trying to have a

00:29:14,390 --> 00:29:19,850
revenue model and a governance model

00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:23,510
that that allows for this so I do think

00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:24,920
I think that the you know yeah I mean it

00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:27,050
makes sense you don't expect something

00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:30,140
to just say well I will go adopt this

00:29:27,050 --> 00:29:32,390
radical you know new approach you know

00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:33,950
even though like you know Zappos does

00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:37,250
holacracy and stuff it's like it's not

00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:40,070
that radical but it's still not done a

00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:42,380
lot so there's not a lot of examples you

00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:44,780
know that people from drupal's

00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:46,160
perspective can easily see and so you

00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:48,140
know why adopt something that's not

00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:50,420
tested it is sort of on us as the

00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:52,460
community to put into practice the

00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:54,140
things we want to see so I think that

00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:55,610
it's got to be from the ground up and we

00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:59,030
can start to do this in specific

00:29:55,610 --> 00:30:00,560
projects I mean you know there's

00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:02,870
actually a lot of opportunity for this

00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:04,550
because like there's still a lot of

00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:07,190
unofficial infrastructure and Drupal a

00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:09,280
little less than historically you know

00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:13,040
more is under the Drupal Association but

00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:15,050
like slack like all of that huge amount

00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:18,080
of community conversation that's going

00:30:15,050 --> 00:30:20,750
on is completely outside the Drupal

00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:23,180
Association right now and the the people

00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:26,090
who run the slacks are you know you're

00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:27,350
basically voluntarily trying to you know

00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:30,020
working with the community working group

00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:33,230
and working with all that - which is

00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:34,760
again like in a weird space with the not

00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:36,290
quite under the Drupal Association that

00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:37,940
they which is again why we've proposed

00:30:36,290 --> 00:30:39,440
there is those proposed so anyhow

00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:40,740
there's the Drupal governance issues

00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:43,040
link link from here and we'll

00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:45,809
we'll keep updating these with resources

00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:47,190
since so yeah please throw your mail in

00:30:45,809 --> 00:30:50,160
there if you want to keep getting

00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:52,080
updates trust us I'm gonna be like every

00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:57,090
year and a half we actually ever email

00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:59,100
anybody never happens the eyes you I do

00:30:57,090 --> 00:31:01,400
think there are there are opportunities

00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:04,920
and just quickly on so CRC and holacracy

00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:07,410
holacracy does yeah puts a few twists on

00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:09,030
so crc including putting a stronger

00:31:07,410 --> 00:31:10,230
emphasis on the organization so I

00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:12,990
actually do think kolakozhi

00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:15,290
might not in many cases be a better fit

00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:18,390
for a company that has sort of a strong

00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:20,820
specific mission and so CRC might be a

00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:23,550
better option for communities that that

00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:31,590
you know is a bit more fractal so thank

00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:34,380
you for the question yes so yeah we are

00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:35,990
at time but any other questions please

00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:41,320
come on thank you

00:31:35,990 --> 00:31:41,320
