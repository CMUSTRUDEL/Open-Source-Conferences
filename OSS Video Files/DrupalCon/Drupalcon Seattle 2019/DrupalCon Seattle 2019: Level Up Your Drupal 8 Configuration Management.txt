Title: DrupalCon Seattle 2019: Level Up Your Drupal 8 Configuration Management
Publication date: 2019-04-12
Playlist: Drupalcon Seattle 2019
Description: 
	Off-the-shelf Drupal 8 configuration management is too heavy-handed at times. By default, itâ€™s challenging to have different configurations in place on each enviornment. How can you have a development-only module such as Devel enabled only on your Development environment but not enabed on higher environments? Moving configuration between environments can cause undesired changes to staging and (ultimately) production environments if not carefully considered.

In this session, we will review a proven approach using core and contributed modules which allows developers to fine tune per-environment configurations. This includes:

Demonstrating how to have modules install/uninstall based on the environment,
Showing how to leverage per-environment settings, and
Provide use cases and examples showing how ignoring some configurations can be beneficial to the overall management of the site.
