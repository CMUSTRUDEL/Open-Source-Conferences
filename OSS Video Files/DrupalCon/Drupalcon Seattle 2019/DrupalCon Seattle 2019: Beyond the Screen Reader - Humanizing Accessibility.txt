Title: DrupalCon Seattle 2019: Beyond the Screen Reader - Humanizing Accessibility
Publication date: 2019-04-12
Playlist: Drupalcon Seattle 2019
Description: 
	We talk a lot about the basics of accessibility. The alphabet soup - WCAG, AAA, WAI-ARIA. Screen readers. Text size. JavaScript dos and don'ts.

But what does it really mean to be accessible? Who is being excluded if our websites aren't accessible? How do we ensure we are including everyone and empowering every user in every scenario to use our sites, products, and devices? We think about deaf and blind users, we check contrast for colorblind users. We consider the elderly and sometimes those with dyslexia. Are we including trans folks? Parents? The chronically ill? People with limited literacy? The injured? People in a major emergency? Who are we designing for? What should we be considering?

If you're wondering how these folks might be affected by accessibility and you want your website to be inclusive for everyone, this is the session for you. No experience needed, we'll be approaching this from a human perspective.
