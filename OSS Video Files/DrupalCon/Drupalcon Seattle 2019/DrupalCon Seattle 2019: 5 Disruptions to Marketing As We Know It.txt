	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,319
okay well good morning everyone really

00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:06,870
excited to be here

00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:09,420
we're going to talk about some some

00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:11,130
disruptive forces in marketing really at

00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:14,429
this intersection of how marketing and

00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:17,190
technology are coming together I I do

00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:19,949
wear multiple hats I work at HubSpot is

00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:21,630
their VP platform ecosystem which really

00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:23,609
boils down to helping HubSpot do a

00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:25,289
better job of integrating with all this

00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:28,529
other amazing software out in the world

00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:29,970
I write the blog chief Marta comm been

00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:32,790
doing that for over 10 years now about

00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:34,020
again a little bit about technology and

00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:36,329
marketing but really more about

00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:38,540
technology professionals working in

00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:41,460
marketing and then I also program the

00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:43,770
mark tech conference so yeah pretty much

00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:45,300
24/7 it smart tech mark tech mark tech

00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:47,460
friends will ask me like Scott you have

00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:49,110
any other hobbies like what do you like

00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:54,059
besides Marta Tech and my answer is

00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:55,230
always more mark tech so alright one of

00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:58,710
the things I've done from a hobby

00:00:55,230 --> 00:01:00,570
perspective is back in 2011 I stared

00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:02,640
this little map of the different

00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:04,920
technologies that I saw marketers using

00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,930
I was imperfect just sort of a rough

00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:09,750
list put together but at the time found

00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:12,720
150 technologies shared them at a

00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:14,460
conference of CMOS look look at how

00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,369
dependent you're becoming on technology

00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:19,200
and the reaction in the room was exactly

00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:22,860
what I'd hope for everyone's like oh my

00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:25,470
goodness 50 marketing technologies will

00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:27,540
we ever keep tracking them all and then

00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:30,869
over the years I kept going back to this

00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:34,920
map with really frankly no design skills

00:01:30,869 --> 00:01:36,540
whatsoever but the the number of

00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:38,460
companies I kept finding that we're

00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:41,220
legitimate mark tech companies kept

00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:42,780
growing you know into the thousands you

00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:46,979
know a few years ago did cross like the

00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:49,880
5,000 mark last year was 6800 this year

00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:53,189
we just released this last week over

00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:54,990
7,000 and this is actually incomplete I

00:01:53,189 --> 00:01:56,850
know it's incomplete because I've

00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:58,530
already heard from a large number of

00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:01,740
great companies that i sadly somehow

00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:03,479
missed but this is a while right I mean

00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:06,750
the amount of technology and marketing

00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:09,750
is astounding and it's not just about

00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:11,610
companies creating technologies cuz you

00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:12,819
could argue hey there is near zero

00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:15,519
barriers entry

00:02:12,819 --> 00:02:17,140
in the world of software today but it's

00:02:15,519 --> 00:02:20,469
that it's not just supply it's also

00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:22,689
demand yeah mary meeker in a

00:02:20,469 --> 00:02:24,459
presentation with kleiner perkins state

00:02:22,689 --> 00:02:27,370
of the internet a couple years ago they

00:02:24,459 --> 00:02:31,720
held on average enterprises had over a

00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:33,540
thousand SAS subscriptions and it wasn't

00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:37,030
just marketing although marketing was

00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:39,189
the top of the leaderboard like with 91

00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:42,750
different subscriptions on average

00:02:39,189 --> 00:02:45,040
there's also HR and finance and sales

00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:46,870
it's not just big enterprise is either

00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:49,120
company called blissfully that I like to

00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:50,590
think of them as TripIt for SAS they

00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,530
help you manage all your different SAS

00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:55,150
subscriptions they recently found for

00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:56,290
SMBs like for companies would say a

00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:59,650
hundred to two hundred and fifty

00:02:56,290 --> 00:03:01,810
employees around ninety nine SAS

00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:03,700
subscriptions on average and again not

00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:05,889
just marketing but you know throughout

00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:09,220
IT throughout sales on accounting

00:03:05,889 --> 00:03:11,919
throughout HR so we've got all this

00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:14,799
explosion of technology now what are we

00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:17,829
doing with it in marketing the roles of

00:03:14,799 --> 00:03:20,049
marketing have really expanded a lot in

00:03:17,829 --> 00:03:24,760
the past particularly the past five

00:03:20,049 --> 00:03:27,040
years I would say actually the CMO

00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:29,470
council would say they did a survey of

00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:32,500
CMOS a year and a half ago and they

00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:34,810
asked what was your top mandate it could

00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:37,000
only pick one and the top mandates were

00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:39,760
accelerate revenue growth across the

00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,699
organization optimize customer

00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:44,650
experience and strategy and champion a

00:03:42,699 --> 00:03:46,690
customer centric corporate culture and

00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:49,150
mindset and the thing that stands out to

00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:51,220
me about this is right this is very much

00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:53,319
about customer experience as a holistic

00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:55,150
thing and there's a real focus here on

00:03:53,319 --> 00:03:57,849
connecting this with revenue and growth

00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:59,620
so I like to say we could just simplify

00:03:57,849 --> 00:04:02,129
this and say okay well marketing is

00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:05,260
about CX in ROI

00:04:02,129 --> 00:04:09,519
do you know what happens if you build

00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:11,349
your ROI directly into your CX you can

00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:13,749
look right

00:04:11,349 --> 00:04:15,609
and believe me if you can repackage mark

00:04:13,749 --> 00:04:17,530
the water for like a five thousand

00:04:15,609 --> 00:04:20,729
percent markup I mean come on it's some

00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:24,660
pretty good marketing there alright so

00:04:20,729 --> 00:04:27,070
this is great the cxn RI but how exactly

00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:29,590
all right how do we leverage all this

00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:31,599
technology to achieve this a friend of

00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:33,220
mine Doug Davidoff had this tweet I

00:04:31,599 --> 00:04:36,840
thought was really great he said it kind

00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:39,610
of boils down to focus and plumbing I

00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:42,039
think that's a pretty fair statement I'm

00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:43,539
not sure I love the plumbing metaphor it

00:04:42,039 --> 00:04:45,130
kind of makes you wonder like well what

00:04:43,539 --> 00:04:46,270
exactly are we pumping through marketing

00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:48,099
here I mean like when we talk about

00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:50,080
marketing stacks you know I don't want

00:04:48,099 --> 00:04:53,199
things I'm just coming to mind all right

00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:56,590
I promise no more body humor the way in

00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:58,690
which people are adapting marketing is

00:04:56,590 --> 00:05:01,389
they're recognizing they have to change

00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:03,009
not just the tools of marketing but the

00:05:01,389 --> 00:05:05,949
structure of marketing and the way in

00:05:03,009 --> 00:05:08,199
which marketing is managed study we did

00:05:05,949 --> 00:05:10,620
of marketing leaders last year found

00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:12,580
nearly 60% of them had been

00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:15,550
restructuring their departments to

00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:17,800
better take advantage of technology and

00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:20,800
so what I want to do for today's

00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:23,979
presentation is just talk about five

00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:25,810
forces that I see marketing leaders

00:05:23,979 --> 00:05:28,690
particularly in the world of marketing

00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:31,509
tech and marketing ops wrestling with to

00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:33,699
achieve this so I framed this as five

00:05:31,509 --> 00:05:38,430
disruptive forces and marketing

00:05:33,699 --> 00:05:43,680
technology and operations and they are

00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:46,479
centralize everything you can automate

00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,110
everything you can all right so far so

00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:52,710
good

00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:57,219
and then decentralize everything you can

00:05:52,710 --> 00:06:01,780
humanize everything you can and embrace

00:05:57,219 --> 00:06:04,389
continuous change I know you might be

00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:06,430
sitting there and like wait a second I

00:06:04,389 --> 00:06:09,159
assure you you're not the only one

00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:12,310
Auggie ray who's like a distinguished

00:06:09,159 --> 00:06:13,870
analyst at Gartner his first reaction to

00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:15,550
this was you just put automate

00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:17,860
everything you can and humanize

00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:20,139
everything you can to places from each

00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:22,710
other I can't decide if that's funny or

00:06:20,139 --> 00:06:25,240
sad all right well thank you all

00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:26,199
my reply actually dog you

00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:28,990
listen the test of a first-rate

00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:30,850
intelligence is the ability called -

00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:33,180
opposed ideas in mind at the same time

00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:36,699
and still retain the ability to function

00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:39,160
and in a lot of ways this really is the

00:06:36,699 --> 00:06:41,349
struggle of modern marketing it's trying

00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:43,919
to hold these opposing concepts in mind

00:06:41,349 --> 00:06:46,389
at the same time and do them both well

00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:48,819
so let's dig into this a little bit more

00:06:46,389 --> 00:06:53,199
we'll take our high wire act here of

00:06:48,819 --> 00:06:56,020
Mark marketing oh wait there's more

00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:57,910
groaners in here I promise you okay but

00:06:56,020 --> 00:07:00,039
we start by looking at this trade-off

00:06:57,910 --> 00:07:02,979
between centralization and

00:07:00,039 --> 00:07:06,130
decentralization now normally we would

00:07:02,979 --> 00:07:10,270
assume this is more of one means less of

00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:13,030
the other but actually it's through

00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:15,190
technology in particular then we're

00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:18,280
realizing we have the opportunity to do

00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:19,930
both simultaneously and I'd like to give

00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:21,639
you a few examples I mean the first

00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:24,340
example is one everyone here would

00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:27,400
recognize right away with web content

00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:29,349
management systems you know platforms

00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:32,139
like Drupal right I mean the whole

00:07:29,349 --> 00:07:34,750
purpose you know of a platform like this

00:07:32,139 --> 00:07:37,650
is to be able to centralize your system

00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:40,419
of how you manage and distribute content

00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:42,400
the structure you use for this content

00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:44,530
the you know standardization on

00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:47,229
presentation styles you know all these

00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:49,599
things are really important but at the

00:07:47,229 --> 00:07:51,280
same time when we do it well what we're

00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:52,389
doing is we're empowering a much broader

00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,490
set of people throughout our

00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:57,099
organization to be able to contribute

00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:59,770
content you know and deploy it in a way

00:07:57,099 --> 00:08:02,080
that it works within these guardrails

00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:04,180
you know that anyone can contribute a

00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,800
blog post or a landing page or you know

00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:09,009
any sort of thing that they need within

00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:10,599
that context so a great WCM you know

00:08:09,009 --> 00:08:13,120
implementation or increasingly we call

00:08:10,599 --> 00:08:15,130
the digital experience platforms right

00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:18,009
they they're a centralized solution

00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:20,259
that's empowering decentralized activity

00:08:18,009 --> 00:08:23,830
a very hot topic in marketing these days

00:08:20,259 --> 00:08:26,229
is also customer data platforms think of

00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:27,729
them as the next generation of CRM same

00:08:26,229 --> 00:08:30,219
same principle applies right we want

00:08:27,729 --> 00:08:32,560
standardized you know the central system

00:08:30,219 --> 00:08:34,719
of records so that we always have you

00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:36,279
know a clear view of the touchpoints

00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:39,200
happening with customers across the

00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:41,150
organization but part of the reason we

00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,680
doing that is so that people on the edge

00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:44,330
of the organization you know a customer

00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:46,880
service rep who's dealing with a

00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:48,770
particular customer you know has access

00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:50,680
to that data and can feed into it and

00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:52,490
update it so there's a centralization

00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:53,960
decentralization thing happening there

00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:56,120
even things like Google sheets right

00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:59,600
standardizing on something like G Suite

00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:01,700
is a centralization decision but then

00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,920
enabling all this collaboration between

00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:04,700
people much more easily on documents and

00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,890
spreadsheets

00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:08,120
that's decentralization I mean we can

00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:10,940
even take this far into things like

00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:13,370
application platform as a service which

00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:15,470
is really a fancy word for some of these

00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:18,700
ideas around low code and no code

00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:22,100
solutions that let non-technical people

00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:25,310
actually become app developers and we'll

00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:26,630
take a look at that a bit too so so

00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:29,390
there's ways you can balance the

00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:30,650
centralization and decentralization you

00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:33,490
know the other axis that we're

00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:37,220
struggling with is automation and

00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:41,300
humanizing our marketing and one of my

00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:44,020
favorite statements on automation is

00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:46,280
actually from Fantasia the original one

00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:48,740
The Sorcerer's Apprentice

00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:50,300
you know Mickey Mouse says the

00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:52,910
apprentice saying it's the magic wand

00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:54,830
and you know has the brooms start doing

00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:58,400
his chores forum this is automation and

00:09:54,830 --> 00:10:00,380
it's delightful awesome up until they

00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:03,260
have exact same automation you know

00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:05,660
starts happening at speed and scale and

00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:11,060
then the exact same automation becomes

00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:15,800
real trouble now we might recognize this

00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:17,600
pattern in marketing this is from market

00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:19,430
Tunis who if you take one thing away

00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,890
from my presentation it's you should

00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:23,810
subscribe to market Tunis Tom fishburne

00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:26,020
who every month sends out a wonderful

00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:28,670
every week since a wonderful cartoon on

00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:29,840
yeah the crazy state of marketing but

00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:34,880
you know it's like we've all seen these

00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:37,970
email things that's two emails why

00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:40,940
you're are responding increasingly these

00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:42,650
things are not being done by hand by

00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:45,140
individuals right they're set up with

00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:47,350
marketing automation systems in fact in

00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:50,330
marketing we refer to it as nurturing

00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:51,500
you feel nurtured don't you yes you know

00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:52,160
but again this is one of these things

00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:54,230
where this

00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:56,480
Automation makes it very easy for us to

00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:59,560
do this speed and scale but what is the

00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:02,800
experience like for the actual customer

00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:05,690
and I think this is actually a real

00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:08,990
challenge for marketing you know when I

00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:10,819
look at automation I think it's helpful

00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:13,790
to look at this on two different axes

00:11:10,819 --> 00:11:16,850
there's things we do to increase the

00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:19,399
efficiency of our company's operations

00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:21,079
our organization's operation and then

00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:23,660
there's things we do to increase the

00:11:21,079 --> 00:11:25,879
efficiency for customers making it

00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:28,129
easier faster more delightful for them

00:11:25,879 --> 00:11:30,560
and so if we put this you know these two

00:11:28,129 --> 00:11:32,389
axes on a 2x2 grid you know if something

00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:34,790
is inefficient for both the company and

00:11:32,389 --> 00:11:40,339
the customer the technical term for that

00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:42,110
is crappy obviously the ideal we're

00:11:40,339 --> 00:11:43,939
going for is saying hey well if it can

00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:45,920
be you know delightful for the customer

00:11:43,939 --> 00:11:50,480
and really efficient for the company

00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:53,329
that would be awesome the other two you

00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:55,870
know there are things we do that aren't

00:11:53,329 --> 00:11:58,699
necessarily efficient for the company

00:11:55,870 --> 00:12:00,680
but if they're efficient for the

00:11:58,699 --> 00:12:02,870
customer helping them get what they need

00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:05,839
and solve the problem they have you know

00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:08,630
quickly and smoothly this may be worth

00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:11,600
it because these become the moments very

00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:13,790
often that define our brand you know are

00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:16,930
we able to delight someone at a moment

00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:19,850
when they need us to go above and beyond

00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:23,240
the one that's scary is the one where we

00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:25,939
implement automation that is incredibly

00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:28,220
efficient for the company but not

00:12:25,939 --> 00:12:29,959
necessarily efficient for the customer

00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:32,060
and you know that sort of example of the

00:12:29,959 --> 00:12:34,220
automated email nurturing thing right I

00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:35,689
mean incredibly efficient for us to you

00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:38,029
know do that just throw the switch you

00:12:35,689 --> 00:12:39,410
know nobody has to type in an email you

00:12:38,029 --> 00:12:40,970
know but for the customer who's now

00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:42,290
having to like you know go through all

00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:45,769
of these yeah we've actually made their

00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:48,230
lives less efficient and it's so easy to

00:12:45,769 --> 00:12:49,939
fall into that trap just because again

00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:52,370
very often when we think about

00:12:49,939 --> 00:12:55,730
efficiency in automation we're usually

00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:58,220
measuring it against objectives of yeah

00:12:55,730 --> 00:13:01,220
internal efficiency and so I think the

00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:03,290
big mission of marketing leaders and

00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:04,910
certainly folks in marketing technology

00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:07,190
Marketing operations is to make sure

00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:09,470
that as we're bringing these automations

00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:11,570
who are business we keep championing it

00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:15,800
through the eyes of how does this affect

00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:17,480
the customers experience you know one

00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:18,829
one campaign I thought I'd highlight on

00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:20,839
this because again this balance of well

00:13:18,829 --> 00:13:24,370
how do you bring automation of

00:13:20,839 --> 00:13:26,600
Technology and humanization together

00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:29,899
some of you may have remembered the

00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:31,310
t-mobile campaign last year where this

00:13:29,899 --> 00:13:33,560
is brilliant this was a nationwide

00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:34,819
marketing campaign they did but you're

00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:38,110
going love this innovation they

00:13:34,819 --> 00:13:41,180
basically said if you call this number a

00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:43,220
real human being will pick up so you're

00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:44,899
not going to have like you know a voice

00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:46,880
prompt system that you have to go

00:13:44,899 --> 00:13:49,490
through and not only will a real human

00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:51,410
being pick up but we guarantee that

00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:52,880
human being won't transfer you around

00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:59,509
they'll basically stick with you until

00:13:52,880 --> 00:14:01,639
the problem is resolved now the

00:13:59,509 --> 00:14:03,319
technology behind this right it's not

00:14:01,639 --> 00:14:05,269
like this is a completely technology

00:14:03,319 --> 00:14:06,920
free situation I mean the technology

00:14:05,269 --> 00:14:09,110
that now we're giving those

00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:10,670
representatives I assure you you know to

00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:12,649
be able have the latest data on the

00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:14,750
customer being able to take actions on

00:14:12,649 --> 00:14:16,550
the customers behalf I'm gonna be able

00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:18,920
to pull the you know request from other

00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:22,310
pieces of the organization a lot of

00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:26,630
Technology in that the face to it for

00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:28,010
the customer is very human so on the

00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:30,980
next 15 minutes that that might be

00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:33,620
helpful to like put these together on a

00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:35,300
grid you know automation and

00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:37,399
humanization centralization

00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:40,240
decentralization and then sort of

00:14:37,399 --> 00:14:42,829
wrestling with change across all of them

00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:44,209
you know to put maybe some other labels

00:14:42,829 --> 00:14:46,130
on this that we might be more familiar

00:14:44,209 --> 00:14:49,279
with I think of centralization as things

00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:51,250
we do for scale decentralization is very

00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:54,010
often things we do for agility

00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:56,329
automation is how we harness technology

00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:58,519
and humanization is how we keep the

00:14:56,329 --> 00:15:00,800
people element of this you know and part

00:14:58,519 --> 00:15:03,160
of that people like our customers that's

00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:05,269
also our employees and our staff as well

00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:06,860
you know and so when you start to go at

00:15:05,269 --> 00:15:08,689
these different quadrants it's like okay

00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:10,310
well centralizing in automation is very

00:15:08,689 --> 00:15:12,620
often where efficiency is coming from

00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:14,720
you know when we look at technology in a

00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:16,880
decentralized view this is very often

00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:19,130
where innovation comes from

00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:21,320
when we look at what it means to be

00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:24,290
centralized with a human focus very

00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:27,500
often this is the core of our brand but

00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:29,510
how we make that brand real not just a

00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:31,040
slogan but wheel is very much when we're

00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:33,620
empowering the decentralized

00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:35,870
organization to live up to that with

00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:37,600
authenticity so let's just go through

00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:40,430
these quadrants and put a little bit of

00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,900
examples of what exactly do we do in

00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:44,150
each of these quadrants and leading

00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:46,160
marketing technology and so yeah well

00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:48,440
start in the North West or north by

00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:50,420
northwest quadrant which is usually what

00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:52,310
people think about when we talk about

00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:53,630
marketing technologies right oh well

00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:56,030
we're going centralized and we're in

00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:57,260
leverage technology it's great it's

00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:59,750
definitely a big part of that you know

00:15:57,260 --> 00:16:03,080
we do things like standardized common

00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:05,060
tools across the organization sometimes

00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:07,190
this is now called rationalizing your

00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:08,720
marketing stack so you have the things

00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:09,700
you need you get rid of the things you

00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,470
don't

00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:14,090
I'm personally fascinated with how

00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:17,720
marketers think of their marketing

00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:20,990
stacks every year I run a contest for

00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:22,910
the community that invites marketers

00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:24,830
descend in a single slide that

00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:27,170
illustrates how they think of their

00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:28,700
marketing tech stack it's not just the

00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:30,800
little logos about you know which tools

00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:32,870
do they use so it's interesting to see

00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:34,910
which tools which companies use but it's

00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:37,670
how do they conceive of all these things

00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:39,650
together you know and because it's a bit

00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:41,360
of an awards competition and because you

00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:42,980
know marketing we have access to graphic

00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,780
designers you know people get a little

00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:46,850
carried away sometimes with the design

00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:48,290
of these things but they're fascinating

00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:50,480
and they're all available up on

00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:52,520
SlideShare if he just googled mark tech

00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:55,010
stack ease there's now like 200 of them

00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:57,500
out there that you know but like this is

00:16:55,010 --> 00:17:00,230
one from Juniper Networks how they've

00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:01,310
thought about organizing it said some

00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:03,530
people get a little carried away and

00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:06,200
this like Airstream the folks who make

00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:07,880
those like groovy campers you know their

00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:10,610
marketing stack Hadley split into

00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:12,860
different in marketing areas the size of

00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:14,960
the different trees represent how much

00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:19,910
time they spend interacting with

00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:21,850
different tools the one other I thought

00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:25,100
I'd just pull as an example here was

00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:26,780
paychecks which had this really cool

00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:29,480
like two-dimensional way of thinking of

00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:30,170
different stages they apply technology

00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:32,480
to

00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:34,310
but also they look at their technology

00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,160
stacked through the lens of okay well

00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:38,450
how much of these things are automated

00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:40,670
you know going all the way down to how

00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:44,120
many of these things really require full

00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:45,980
manual interaction and I thought it's

00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:50,380
also cool that one of their foundational

00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:52,340
systems was Drupal oh cool

00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:54,950
so other things we do in this

00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:56,840
centralization and automation quadrant

00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:58,940
is you know we standardized common data

00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:01,520
you know what's the structure for

00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:03,350
customer records I mean the single most

00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:05,000
important piece of data to standardize

00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:07,250
on is how we're tracking customer

00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,830
identity across the different touch

00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:12,500
points we have with them we standardize

00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:15,650
processes you know classic marketing

00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:18,320
operations and increasingly I think we

00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:21,230
start to look at the marketing stack in

00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:23,720
the marketing ops organization as in

00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:25,370
many ways a platform itself right it's a

00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:26,900
combination of tools underneath the

00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:29,330
surface but what we're trying to package

00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:31,700
them up you know as a platform to

00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:34,070
empower the rest of the marketing org

00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:37,340
and even the rest of the business itself

00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:40,310
to leverage this so let's slide over to

00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:43,550
the decentralized portion of technology

00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:45,800
here and this is where right we we want

00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:48,350
to be able to enable local experiments

00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:50,360
and workflows because not every team you

00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:52,610
know in marketing on every individual

00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:54,160
needs to do the exact same things they

00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:57,170
have different missions different jobs

00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:59,090
while we centralize a lot of tools we

00:18:57,170 --> 00:19:01,610
also get to decide hey where is it okay

00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:03,620
for individuals or small teams to bring

00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:05,930
some of their own tools that a purpose

00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:07,160
fit to what they're doing how do we

00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:09,080
think about it when we have these

00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:11,150
multiple tools dealing in a world where

00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:12,740
there's there's federated data you know

00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:14,750
that yes there may be a centralized

00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:17,000
record of this - but there's variations

00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:18,920
of this throughout the org you know that

00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,590
can be okay as long as we figure out a

00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:24,170
way to connect the important pieces and

00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:26,000
one in particular that I alluded to

00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:28,640
earlier that I'm just fascinated by is

00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:31,250
this notion of citizen developers and

00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:35,380
data scientists and integrators this

00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:38,390
idea that non technical professionals

00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:39,950
increasingly have the tools to be able

00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:43,010
to do things that used to require

00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:45,380
technical specialists so you

00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:46,640
you remember that movie ratatouille and

00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:49,300
they have anyone can cook you know

00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:52,790
anyone can develop integrate analyze um

00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:53,840
and you might be skeptical this I'm

00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:57,140
gonna walk you through I'm gonna show

00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:59,890
you how every marketer give or take

00:19:57,140 --> 00:20:03,440
every marketer is an app developer now

00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:05,150
all right so let's imagine over time the

00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:08,000
amount of app like functionality that

00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:12,640
any marketer can wield well start with

00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:16,850
Excel how many of you have used Excel

00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:18,470
okay great this is this was marketing

00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:22,340
technology before there was marketing

00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:24,770
technology we love Excel well actually

00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:27,650
more recent times number of folks may

00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:29,990
have moved to something like G suite and

00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:31,790
Google sheets a couple reasons for that

00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:34,280
one is actually it really did have a

00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:36,080
nice environment for having multiple

00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:38,210
people collaborating on the same sheet

00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:40,400
at the same time but another little

00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:42,980
twist to this came up which is one of

00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:44,390
the other things in the G suite is you

00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:45,950
can publish web forms

00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:47,750
you know either internal or external to

00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:50,180
collect data and then map that right

00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:51,980
into a Google sheet so if you think

00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:53,810
about this right you can essentially

00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:55,550
publish a little data collection app out

00:20:53,810 --> 00:20:56,960
in the world and pull that data right

00:20:55,550 --> 00:21:00,680
into a spreadsheet so a little bit more

00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:02,420
app like functionality then how many of

00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:06,890
you have heard of a tool or use a tool

00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:08,300
called zapier ok quite a few this is

00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:09,790
there's a whole bunch of these out here

00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:12,310
they're these really lightweight

00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:14,750
non-technical tools that let you

00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:16,040
basically create these little workflows

00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:18,440
between all your different cloud

00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:20,300
applications you know so for instance if

00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:22,130
I you know I'm getting data that's you

00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:24,140
know coming through on a web form I can

00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:26,090
then like you know map that to things

00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:27,740
like Google sheets but I can also take

00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:30,650
stuff like in Google sheets and I can

00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:33,470
map that data into things like my CRM or

00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:35,090
my marketing automation platform and

00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:36,950
again it's it's very very simple

00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:39,170
interface but now right you add this on

00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:41,960
top of the spreadsheet and the forms and

00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:45,470
all of a sudden well ok without any code

00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:47,000
any IT I can now kind of like collect

00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:49,610
data from anywhere move it

00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,380
my entire marketing stack pretty

00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:52,940
impressive

00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:55,909
well actually taking this idea of using

00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:59,090
spreadsheets or spreadsheet like formats

00:21:55,909 --> 00:22:01,309
to build apps has exploded you know

00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:03,140
there's companies like err table worth

00:22:01,309 --> 00:22:07,809
looking up like if you can create a

00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:10,070
spreadsheet you can create a web app

00:22:07,809 --> 00:22:11,330
Salesforce actually last year released

00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:14,090
this thing that you can actually take a

00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:15,350
spreadsheet upload it to Salesforce and

00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:17,840
they'll turn it into one of their

00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:21,110
lightning apps I even came across this

00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:24,049
company a couple weeks ago glide that

00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:25,970
again same my idea basically you create

00:22:24,049 --> 00:22:27,860
a spreadsheet in a certain set of

00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:30,650
columns and then it turns around and

00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:33,250
automatically publishes that as a mobile

00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:35,059
app so if you can use Excel

00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:38,390
congratulations you're all app

00:22:35,059 --> 00:22:40,190
developers - this is happening

00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:42,200
throughout technology right I mean you

00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:43,789
know this this this democratization

00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:45,799
where things that used to require

00:22:43,789 --> 00:22:48,530
discipline experts like you know

00:22:45,799 --> 00:22:50,419
specialists in IT it starts to come down

00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:52,460
to domain experts what we would think of

00:22:50,419 --> 00:22:54,049
as marketing technologists or marketing

00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:56,000
ops leaders you know but then

00:22:54,049 --> 00:22:58,370
increasingly to power users and regular

00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,740
users just the cost to do this becomes

00:22:58,370 --> 00:23:02,630
you know cheaper and cheaper and there's

00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:05,659
basic economics go right the cheaper it

00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:08,179
becomes the more that we get and so we

00:23:05,659 --> 00:23:10,460
see this transformation happening in the

00:23:08,179 --> 00:23:14,390
world of ite about the shift from code

00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:18,230
to low code to know code maybe at some

00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:19,700
point no build it just happens and it

00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:22,520
kind of mirrors what we're seeing in

00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:24,350
marketing this transition from IT to

00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:27,140
marketing technologists to increasingly

00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:29,630
any marketer in the organization being

00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:31,280
able to wield this capability and this

00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:33,530
is really where I think we see this sort

00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:35,750
of citizen developer movement happening

00:23:33,530 --> 00:23:37,130
in marketing and so in the ten years

00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:38,870
that I've been writing about the

00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:41,570
intersection of marketing and technology

00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:43,250
the the big transition we wrestled with

00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:45,350
was this transition of how much to

00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:48,590
handoff between the IT department and

00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:51,289
the marketing team I think over the next

00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:52,610
five to ten years this transition of how

00:23:51,289 --> 00:23:54,770
do we empower more and more

00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:57,890
decentralized capabilities to the entire

00:23:54,770 --> 00:24:01,310
marketing org is going to be an amazing

00:23:57,890 --> 00:24:03,940
transition alright so let's let's slide

00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:08,740
down a bit from the technology side into

00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:11,300
the human elements of this right and

00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:14,240
maybe the big thing is this focus on

00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:16,520
marketing and Powerman you know what I

00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:18,110
think the key of this is recognizing

00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:20,540
that marketing is no longer just the

00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:22,340
marketing department it's empowering the

00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:24,680
people in our sales organizations our

00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:26,930
customer service organizations to be

00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:29,870
able to respond to the needs and the

00:24:26,930 --> 00:24:33,020
concerns that individual prospects and

00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:35,660
customers have it's about giving those

00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:37,700
people the levers for empathy and

00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:39,170
intuition you know how many of you have

00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:41,180
ever been on a customer service call

00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:43,610
where I mean you were having a problem

00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:45,200
and the customer service rep understood

00:24:43,610 --> 00:24:47,060
it right I mean they got it they knew

00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:49,760
what your problem was they felt for you

00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:51,230
and they're like I'm sorry I can't do I

00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:52,190
don't have the authority to do this

00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:55,160
you're gonna have to call this other

00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:56,750
hotline you know I mean it's kind of

00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:58,910
heartbreaking for everyone on that call

00:24:56,750 --> 00:25:01,460
it's like yes we were almost there but

00:24:58,910 --> 00:25:03,470
sorry you know and again in some ways

00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:05,150
you know that t-mobile campaign I think

00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:08,570
really you know spoke to this pain point

00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:11,930
you know how can we just empower the

00:25:08,570 --> 00:25:14,570
organization you know it involves having

00:25:11,930 --> 00:25:16,670
marketing and including marketing ops

00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:19,070
and marketing tech people do the

00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:20,630
anthropological exercise of spend time

00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:22,790
in person with customers and really

00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:25,550
understand them to the degree that we're

00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:27,170
applying technology to this - it's about

00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:28,940
not just technology for creating

00:25:27,170 --> 00:25:30,440
experiences but it's how do we put

00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:33,140
technology in place to help us get

00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:35,890
better at determining anomalies in what

00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:38,300
we expect that customer experience to be

00:25:35,890 --> 00:25:40,790
and then I think you pull all that back

00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:42,410
into the centralization and humanization

00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:44,930
you know that's where the brand quadrant

00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:46,700
where a couple of the things that I put

00:25:44,930 --> 00:25:49,760
in here one is this idea of marketing

00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:51,380
enablement now in marketing we've been

00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:53,000
familiar for a long time with sales

00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:54,980
enablement right we make all this

00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,290
content and capabilities to help

00:25:54,980 --> 00:26:00,800
salespeople be more effective but they

00:25:57,290 --> 00:26:02,810
do with all this technology here it's

00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:04,940
really important for us to provide that

00:26:02,810 --> 00:26:07,430
same sort of enablement for our

00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:09,500
marketing teams to

00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:11,660
study we did last year found on average

00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:13,520
2/3 the companies we talked to just

00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:16,270
admitted they don't think they have the

00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:19,940
skills or talent necessary to take

00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:21,770
advantage of marketing technology one

00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:25,280
very concrete example I thought was

00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:27,140
fascinating is Airbnb which it's a very

00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:29,780
data-driven company they've created some

00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:32,060
amazing technological infrastructure for

00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:34,670
you know getting data from experiments

00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:36,440
and using it to make decisions but one

00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:37,880
of the things they realized is wow

00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:39,650
that's great we got all this technology

00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:43,010
for it most of the people coming into

00:26:39,650 --> 00:26:46,040
every to be didn't really know how to

00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:48,610
leverage that to make good datum driven

00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:51,860
decisions and so they created a whole

00:26:48,610 --> 00:26:53,810
data university inside Airbnb and

00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:55,760
everyone who joins Airbnb and goes

00:26:53,810 --> 00:26:57,500
through this and they've been very open

00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:59,660
about sharing the details of this

00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:01,160
University they have like a whole medium

00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:03,290
account for it but it's fascinating this

00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:05,270
is this is marketing enabling right it's

00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:07,580
helping to teach the entire organization

00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:09,880
how to take advantage of this technology

00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:12,560
effectively

00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:14,420
it's about enlightened gov in governance

00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:16,190
right this idea that centralization is

00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:19,160
good but we don't want to get to the

00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:21,740
point where it's so constrictive that it

00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:24,530
basically shuts off that decentralized

00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:26,420
authenticity and innovation it's about

00:27:24,530 --> 00:27:28,370
using things like customer codes and

00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:31,670
culture codes you know to have a

00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:33,890
standard a a common purpose and

00:27:31,670 --> 00:27:36,200
direction we're using but giving people

00:27:33,890 --> 00:27:39,650
enough flexibility in how they implement

00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:41,720
that to be effective and then at the

00:27:39,650 --> 00:27:43,310
center of this whole adventure right is

00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:45,320
the fact that however you construct

00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:47,180
these pieces it's that we're living in a

00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:49,970
world where change is just coming at us

00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:51,830
at an incredible rate I'd say in the ten

00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:53,930
years I've been doing this the the the

00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:56,000
biggest paradox has been you know

00:27:53,930 --> 00:27:58,640
watching companies wrestle with the

00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,230
exponential change in technology which

00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:02,090
we can more or less say is true right I

00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:04,840
mean this is kind of Moore's law but you

00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:09,050
know taken across so many things and

00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:10,880
having that juxtaposed against the way

00:28:09,050 --> 00:28:12,890
in which we change as human beings and

00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,880
as custer's of human beings and

00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:17,750
organizations

00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:20,900
I mean organizational change is slow and

00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:23,090
so this gap that widens between these

00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:24,740
really challenging there's two ways we

00:28:23,090 --> 00:28:26,960
can deal with that one is we can be very

00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:29,900
intentional in choosing which changes we

00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:32,150
embrace and the other thing we can do is

00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:33,940
we can actually think about okay how do

00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:36,470
we we can't make our organization

00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:39,290
exponential but can we be more agile

00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:41,540
than our competitors you know and so

00:28:39,290 --> 00:28:43,850
this comes down to doing things like you

00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:47,090
know designing our marketing text acts

00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:49,580
for change in the interest of time I

00:28:47,090 --> 00:28:51,590
won't dig too deep into this but there's

00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:54,380
a Gartner model for thinking about

00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:56,810
designing IT stacks you know to have

00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:59,570
stable foundations going up to systems

00:28:56,810 --> 00:29:00,860
that change very rapidly and this is

00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:03,230
something we're now seeing marketing

00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:04,820
tech and Ops teams embrace naturally one

00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:05,810
of the stack e's we got a few years ago

00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:07,820
from Microsoft

00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:09,590
they actually mapped their entire stack

00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:11,810
around these three different colors of

00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:13,970
blue that represent that Gartner paste

00:29:11,810 --> 00:29:17,750
layering model from stable foundations

00:29:13,970 --> 00:29:19,670
to more innovative experiments agile

00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:21,380
marketing is another way in which we do

00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:24,020
this it's not just pretty words to say

00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:25,700
there's actual methodology here super

00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:27,350
excited to see rollin smarts going to be

00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:29,840
presenting on this track later today

00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:31,730
he's one of the world experts in agile

00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:33,350
marketing and I just ran into my good

00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:35,960
friend in the audience here Jim yeol

00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:38,510
who's another pioneer in agile marketing

00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:46,370
so if you see Jim connect with him but

00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:48,410
increasingly we're seeing third of

00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:50,540
marketing orgs are embracing some kind

00:29:48,410 --> 00:29:52,280
of agile you know and again not just

00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:56,440
pretty words to say but they're doing

00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:56,440
you know actual agile methodologies

00:29:56,740 --> 00:30:01,820
using Kanban boards you know variety of

00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:03,530
ways you can implement this it's about

00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:05,990
being very intentional and saying hey

00:30:03,530 --> 00:30:10,340
listen dealing with iterative and

00:30:05,990 --> 00:30:12,890
adaptive change is a core part of what

00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:14,540
marketing must now do and there's so

00:30:12,890 --> 00:30:17,570
many things right now you know reading

00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:19,430
on red teaming and anti fragility but it

00:30:17,570 --> 00:30:21,910
really comes down to maybe one thing

00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:25,250
above all else which is just marketing

00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:27,170
really needs to have be the champion of

00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:28,940
an open mindset not for just how we

00:30:27,170 --> 00:30:31,370
continually evolve and change the way we

00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:32,710
do business but the way we adapt to

00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:34,899
these ever-changing

00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:38,679
customer expectations of what a great

00:30:34,899 --> 00:30:41,080
business does so thank you very much I

00:30:38,679 --> 00:30:42,700
will be around after the next talk too

00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:43,340
and happy to answer questions one on one

00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:48,080
thank you

00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:48,080
