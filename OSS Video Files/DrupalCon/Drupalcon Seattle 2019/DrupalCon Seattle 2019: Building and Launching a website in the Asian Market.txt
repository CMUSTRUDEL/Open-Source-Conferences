Title: DrupalCon Seattle 2019: Building and Launching a website in the Asian Market
Publication date: 2019-04-12
Playlist: Drupalcon Seattle 2019
Description: 
	Businesses are always taking opportunities for growth and are looking to expand to new markets. One of the emerging areas where a lot of companies are looking to build a presence nowadays is Asia. Acquiring new customers in a new market and then serving them means that all these companies would need a website / digital footprint to serve the target audience.

In this session, we will discuss about the details you should keep in mind when building a website for the Asian market and how you can best tailor their experience on your website by analyzing the following:

Cultural context and differencesÂ 
Targeting your audience
Design & Content
Domain names, Multilingual Hosting, CDN
Data Tracking and other technical aspects

	00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:03,780
or we'll give everyone a couple more

00:00:01,829 --> 00:00:08,849
seconds to see if anyone else is joining

00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:10,650
and then we'll probably kick it off also

00:00:08,849 --> 00:00:13,190
tweet you know grab an extra five people

00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:16,410
in the hallway fill it in

00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:18,150
take a picture share that don't Twitter

00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:20,300
with your other co-workers or anything

00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:24,960
like that

00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:27,570
by doing something like sure it out yeah

00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,880
and I think we've got we'd like to

00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:33,420
probably start and share a little bit of

00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:36,960
our experience for building websites in

00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:39,600
the Asian market we'd like to kick off

00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:42,090
by introducing ourselves hi everyone my

00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,840
name is Adriana I'm a senior project

00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:48,539
manager at F of W I've been working with

00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:50,100
Drupal for about seven years or seven

00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:51,750
plus years now and I've been doing

00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:55,500
project management for about eight years

00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:57,000
or so and I'm Andrew Wilden director of

00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:00,510
strategy and solution architecture at

00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,579
ffw I have been doing Drupal since it

00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:05,489
was not fun to say you were doing Drupal

00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:09,500
if anyone remembers the era of Drupal 4

00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:13,710
and no install screen you feel my pain

00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:15,810
but you know over the last couple of

00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:17,700
years as we've grown we've actually

00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:19,799
noticed quite a bit of change in how

00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:21,049
sites you know evolve you know what are

00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:24,990
the requirements for building something

00:01:21,049 --> 00:01:26,670
but most interesting is let's just say

00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:28,880
look at a regular map of the world right

00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:33,030
this is our usual here's our offices

00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:35,189
everywhere we're located if you resize

00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:39,420
and think about the world in terms of

00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:43,350
internet usage in 2011 the world looked

00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:46,079
quite different right basically just

00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:49,950
resizing the entire map based on a

00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:52,920
number of Internet users pretty much you

00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:54,990
see a fairly heavy focus on you know

00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:56,759
East Asia in particular which makes

00:01:54,990 --> 00:02:00,060
sense given it a thumbs you some 4

00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:01,799
billion plus people but interestingly if

00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:03,049
you actually look at just growth in the

00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:05,430
last 10 years

00:02:03,049 --> 00:02:07,740
internet adoption throughout the region

00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:09,490
has doubled so this map is already

00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:11,140
massively out of date sand

00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:14,650
be much bigger bubbles on like the right

00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:17,410
side of it as we've gone through and

00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:19,240
seen kind of general trends one

00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:20,710
interesting complexity that's come up in

00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:23,740
a lot of the larger platform billets we

00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:26,710
do is it's not simply enough to

00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:28,090
translate content anymore writes it back

00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:30,070
in Drupal 7 it was a great thing that

00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:33,160
you could install a couple modules your

00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:34,900
content was quasi multilingual we don't

00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:38,140
need to get into how hacky multilingual

00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:40,180
was in d7 but it was a thing Drupal AIDS

00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:44,110
we ended up adopting multilingual in

00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:45,730
 that in some ways was just you

00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:47,950
know market demands right there was

00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:49,390
quite a lot of work being invested from

00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:52,150
the community just to get multilingual

00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:54,400
up and running but more generally

00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:57,300
speaking it actually preceded a lot of

00:02:54,400 --> 00:03:00,460
trends that came a few years later that

00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:02,440
web experiences worldwide needed to be

00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:06,340
much more fine-tuned and local to the

00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:08,770
audience's they served as we've gone

00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:10,630
through and done you know over the last

00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:12,850
few years going from two to three sites

00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:14,920
that had to focus on East Asia in

00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:16,600
particular now we're up to you know

00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:18,580
twenty thirty in almost any major

00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:20,320
platform build this is a consideration

00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:22,930
that comes up and the question always

00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:24,400
occurs what exactly do you do

00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:26,560
differently is there anything

00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:29,020
fundamentally unique about doing you

00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:31,570
know a site that's going to be based out

00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:33,130
of East Asia does it being in China make

00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:36,880
different than doing a site for Japan or

00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:39,370
Korea and while this could be a five

00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:41,200
minute talk of make sure to check and

00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:42,550
make that it's localized or a four hour

00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,950
talk of every nuance

00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:46,390
we've just got you know three key points

00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:49,840
want to go over the next twenty minutes

00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:51,520
of just really easy takeaways for next

00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:56,070
time you have a project focusing on East

00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:56,070
Asia what you can focus on to start from

00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:05,590
so number one just taken to account the

00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:07,240
context in which you're building if I'm

00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:09,580
being really general this is technically

00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:10,890
the Asian market which is why our title

00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:13,570
of the presentations a little misleading

00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:15,850
when you're dealing with over half the

00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:20,799
planet there's not any one single market

00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:22,930
you can actually design for if we even

00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:26,139
get into some more detail right

00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:29,199
we're talking 48 countries over 2,300

00:04:26,139 --> 00:04:32,229
languages and every region is actually

00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:34,000
quite unique even it's the typical site

00:04:32,229 --> 00:04:36,130
you're doing for one country you can be

00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,380
encountering you know 5 10 20 different

00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:40,860
personas so trying to group all of this

00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:44,530
at the top level is next to impossible

00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:46,479
but still taking into account you know

00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:48,820
some general trends of how like much

00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:51,340
scale we're looking at you know there

00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:55,419
can be quite a lot of gap for region to

00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:56,889
region so start there so the exercises

00:04:55,419 --> 00:04:58,570
of what you know we're gonna be talking

00:04:56,889 --> 00:05:00,370
a little more detail we're just gonna

00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:03,190
focus it down to China Japan Korea

00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:07,660
Vietnam right so going down from for

00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:09,840
soma billion to 1.6 yeah and when we're

00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:12,760
talking about all of these countries

00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:14,830
that's great and there are a lot of

00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:17,620
things to cover but at the end of the

00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:20,860
day we are building products for humans

00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:23,830
and at the core how we do things and how

00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:27,070
we act relies a lot on the culture that

00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:28,900
we have so we want to take a step back

00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:31,210
and discuss a little bit about that

00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:33,729
which is not necessarily related to

00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:35,889
technology first but it is going to

00:05:33,729 --> 00:05:37,750
decide how you build technology for

00:05:35,889 --> 00:05:39,909
humans and how your products are

00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:41,740
actually going to be built so it has a

00:05:39,909 --> 00:05:45,430
Dutch researcher that spent a lot of

00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:46,720
time doing data analysis on how

00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:50,050
different cultures and countries

00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:53,650
perceive six key differentiations

00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:56,260
between countries and cultures at their

00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:58,090
core so we wanted to highlight those

00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:59,740
because they would be important in

00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:02,349
driving some of the decisions that you

00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:04,090
make for how you position your product

00:06:02,349 --> 00:06:07,630
how you build your product and how you

00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:10,479
build the user experience around it so

00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:14,080
power distance is something very

00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:15,880
important because it helps understand

00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:18,010
how society perceived different

00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:19,960
hierarchy levels and how everything is

00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:22,409
constructed at the society level and

00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:25,750
what drives some of their decisions

00:06:22,409 --> 00:06:28,539
individualism is another key point how

00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:30,159
feminine or masculine the society is and

00:06:28,539 --> 00:06:32,460
how they build a culture of

00:06:30,159 --> 00:06:32,460
collaboration

00:06:34,229 --> 00:06:39,699
happy they are with ambiguity and

00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:43,030
uncertainty or are they scared about it

00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:44,620
that may impact a lot how you do your

00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:48,310
commerce or how they take some other

00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:50,680
decisions in regards to money and other

00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:52,810
things going on with that and how to

00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:55,210
plan for the future for the long term

00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:57,520
vision that they have and how indulgent

00:06:55,210 --> 00:07:00,280
they are with different errors or

00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:02,349
mistakes or returns that may they may

00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:06,189
need to make and other shipments that go

00:07:02,349 --> 00:07:09,610
with that so we want to emphasize one

00:07:06,189 --> 00:07:13,150
thing that this describes more the

00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:15,669
cultural aspect of this and that it

00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:17,710
applies to broader audiences it doesn't

00:07:15,669 --> 00:07:21,189
apply to individual people so it's

00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:23,289
important to keep that in mind and we

00:07:21,189 --> 00:07:24,909
didn't work like a test there's a

00:07:23,289 --> 00:07:27,189
website where you can compare compare

00:07:24,909 --> 00:07:30,039
different countries in regards to these

00:07:27,189 --> 00:07:34,060
six key elements at the cultural level

00:07:30,039 --> 00:07:36,250
and a comparison of China France and the

00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:39,490
United States so you can see how all of

00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:42,039
these countries compare to one another

00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:44,199
and if you want a global brand you may

00:07:42,039 --> 00:07:45,909
want to position yourselves and to have

00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:48,159
a present and all of these very

00:07:45,909 --> 00:07:51,339
different markets so it's important to

00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:53,589
understand that how you do that is going

00:07:51,339 --> 00:07:55,870
to be driven by some of these cultural

00:07:53,589 --> 00:08:00,159
differences that you have which are at

00:07:55,870 --> 00:08:02,919
the core level of a nation so that draws

00:08:00,159 --> 00:08:04,750
us into your conversation point about

00:08:02,919 --> 00:08:07,389
experience and you may ask yourselves

00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:10,539
how exactly some of those key elements

00:08:07,389 --> 00:08:12,189
could impact what you design on a

00:08:10,539 --> 00:08:14,800
website or write for how you do the

00:08:12,189 --> 00:08:19,089
design in a product and we wanted to

00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:21,339
highlight a couple of aspects and

00:08:19,089 --> 00:08:25,360
elements that we thought about so one of

00:08:21,339 --> 00:08:27,520
them is logos some countries may want to

00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:29,800
have an emphasis on how big the logo is

00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:32,829
and how preeminent something is when you

00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:35,050
go on a website another important point

00:08:32,829 --> 00:08:38,050
could be the usage of colors there may

00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:40,269
be countries or cultures where you need

00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:42,819
to have a very high contrast between the

00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:44,860
colors or there may be situations when

00:08:42,819 --> 00:08:45,900
you need to have a very subtle

00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:48,510
compliment

00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:50,520
look to them the content strategy is

00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:52,820
also going to be very important because

00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:55,770
how you deliver the messages and the

00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:59,550
perception that your visitors have about

00:08:55,770 --> 00:09:01,710
it is going to drive the elements on the

00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:05,340
page and how everything is built around

00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:07,620
that some people or the message

00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:10,410
delivered in some of the areas needs to

00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:12,510
be short whereas in other areas it needs

00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:15,720
to be very long and explicative so that

00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:18,000
it builds more trust and more connection

00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:20,040
with the brand another thing is called

00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,920
to actions which are very important in

00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:24,960
how you drive your business and how you

00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:27,300
figure out that you have a conversion or

00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:29,460
other you know actions to take regarding

00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:31,320
that should they be subtle on the pages

00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:34,110
should they be very preeminent on the

00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:35,910
pages those are important details that

00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:38,340
are going to be very different from one

00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:42,390
country to another even though we look

00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:44,580
at the Asian market as a whole right and

00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:46,710
what's interesting is this is nothing

00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:48,390
new for most of us rights just quite a

00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:50,940
quick survey from the audience how many

00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:53,310
people here are you know either an in

00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:57,450
development agency or freelance doing

00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:59,400
you know Drupal raise of hands how many

00:09:57,450 --> 00:10:04,440
people are in you know larger scale

00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:06,960
multinational business okay so overlap a

00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:09,780
nice little Venn diagram there the idea

00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:12,150
that your audiences actually understand

00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:13,950
the visual cues differently that can

00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:16,320
change from persona to persona on any

00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:19,500
given websites it becomes a lot trickier

00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:21,210
when we're dealing with let's say four

00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:23,610
or five different regions they each have

00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:25,830
their own set of stakeholders on some

00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:27,390
recent projects we've encountered this

00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:28,860
is actually become a bit of a sticking

00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:31,320
point right who makes the ultimate

00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:32,820
decision are we looking at you know in

00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:34,140
market decision of you know how the

00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:35,880
customers are interacting with the

00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:38,220
product are we looking at executive

00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:40,230
stakeholders who may be in one region or

00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:43,110
another but are trying to enforce you

00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:44,580
know some sense of brand compliance one

00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:46,290
way to walk back from that is actually

00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:48,360
to simply give a framework like this out

00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:51,330
it's like okay let's actually prioritize

00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:53,490
piece by piece how we want to make a

00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:56,310
decision right what are areas where

00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:58,750
local market context may matter more

00:10:56,310 --> 00:11:00,819
than you know executive sign-off

00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:02,769
or more than you know even some certain

00:11:00,819 --> 00:11:04,089
elements of brand compliance where the

00:11:02,769 --> 00:11:09,730
brand was not originally suited to

00:11:04,089 --> 00:11:11,110
extend to that direction one interesting

00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:14,560
example where the sex you can work in

00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:17,019
Reverse is previous to coming back to

00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,670
the US and coming ffw I was working an

00:11:17,019 --> 00:11:22,990
open-source adoption for the Chinese

00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:24,699
government so this is a former life of

00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:27,009
mine Chinese Academy of Sciences in

00:11:24,699 --> 00:11:31,569
Kunming far southwest China over by

00:11:27,009 --> 00:11:34,120
Tibet Thailand Vietnam when I had first

00:11:31,569 --> 00:11:38,759
joined they had solely a Chinese

00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:41,310
websites it was very much geared around

00:11:38,759 --> 00:11:44,889
what was translated as you know like

00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:47,350
public science outreach right the goal

00:11:44,889 --> 00:11:49,689
was to showcase the government's work in

00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:53,199
the area promoting biodiversity genomics

00:11:49,689 --> 00:11:55,689
research hiv/aids research and you know

00:11:53,199 --> 00:11:57,490
new drug testing consequently they

00:11:55,689 --> 00:11:58,930
handed me you know just you know here's

00:11:57,490 --> 00:12:01,389
the website we need to make something in

00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:05,649
English and the first conversation was

00:12:01,389 --> 00:12:07,709
why is the logo so big the response was

00:12:05,649 --> 00:12:10,300
the logos begin because it's important

00:12:07,709 --> 00:12:12,430
actually the first thing that someone

00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:14,949
sees that had gone through rounds and

00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:18,279
rounds of sign-off between Beijing and

00:12:14,949 --> 00:12:20,350
the local Institute that I worked at and

00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:22,300
they are interesting question that I

00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:23,910
posed them was so where'd you someone

00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:26,410
actually find what the research is that

00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:28,269
apparently was not a key factor they

00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:30,069
figured the scientific audience abroad

00:12:28,269 --> 00:12:31,569
would be more likely to actually

00:12:30,069 --> 00:12:33,069
download the paper from a peer-reviewed

00:12:31,569 --> 00:12:36,579
journal so it didn't really matter it

00:12:33,069 --> 00:12:38,829
was on the website going through this

00:12:36,579 --> 00:12:41,110
you know two-year UX process with them

00:12:38,829 --> 00:12:44,199
on making English sites we took all the

00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:46,329
original Chinese contents but walked

00:12:44,199 --> 00:12:48,459
through the idea that logo and

00:12:46,329 --> 00:12:50,680
affiliation matters much more to just

00:12:48,459 --> 00:12:53,529
showcase and give some very subtle

00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:55,809
context to the content but the content

00:12:53,529 --> 00:12:57,129
is actually far more impactful so we

00:12:55,809 --> 00:12:58,629
ended up with a much more tiled layout

00:12:57,129 --> 00:13:00,459
where the researchers very prominently

00:12:58,629 --> 00:13:02,620
featured right within two or three

00:13:00,459 --> 00:13:06,699
clicks you can get to you know the major

00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:08,019
funding all the major projects and you

00:13:06,699 --> 00:13:10,540
just kind of little more detail right

00:13:08,019 --> 00:13:12,350
they had a huge recruitment drive how do

00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:14,450
we get people who are from abroad

00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:15,800
you come and join right in particular

00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:18,350
they were targeting researchers from

00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:21,560
Africa other East Asian countries and

00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:23,330
Southeast Asia as well so very simple

00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:25,010
join us give them a very prominent

00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:29,630
call-to-action that anyone can see and

00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:32,030
understand we talked about folding this

00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:34,280
back in to the original Chinese site and

00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:35,660
the response was no no if the current

00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:37,400
site is great it meets all functional

00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:39,530
needs the logo is very big

00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:41,570
there's dedicated links off to more

00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:44,060
content that are elsewhere but the main

00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:46,280
focus needs to stay here and that

00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:47,750
actually worked really well aside from

00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:49,400
looking a little bit dated this was a

00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:52,940
very successful web project in the terms

00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:55,880
of uptake of usage internationally was

00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:57,770
quite high even usage within mainland

00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:59,180
China have gone up substantially once we

00:13:57,770 --> 00:14:00,650
had reshaped some of the content and

00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:05,930
just balanced out the colors and telling

00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:08,270
a little bit and really this kind of led

00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:10,520
when Adriana were talking about this to

00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:12,590
this presentation that it's a who are

00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:14,540
you building for right a scientific

00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:17,000
audience out of southwestern China is

00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:19,070
very different than global multinational

00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:25,010
company out of the US or Europe having a

00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:26,540
separate office set up in China so just

00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:28,790
three quick things are you thinking

00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:30,130
about who you building for right just

00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:32,360
take some time to know the audience

00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:36,410
actually go through those very basic UX

00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:38,360
exercises of who it is this for check

00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:40,160
out you know any trends in this case

00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:42,380
we're China rights the average age for

00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:45,890
someone using Baidu as a search engine

00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:47,690
is 25 if we're looking by comparison

00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:51,410
the average age of a search engine user

00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:53,990
in North America is you know an entire

00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:56,870
ten years in advance of that and Europe

00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:58,610
even higher and funny enough this

00:14:56,870 --> 00:15:02,180
actually bears out quite a bit in terms

00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:05,780
of the interaction patterns you know

00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:08,210
average researchers or sorry searchers

00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:09,860
excuse me on mobile and biting will

00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:12,040
spend up to 55 seconds on the page

00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:14,330
before deciding where to go next I

00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:16,280
actually was a little confused I read

00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:18,890
this research that in the u.s. it's 8 to

00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:20,210
10 seconds but try spending a minute on

00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:23,690
a Google search result screen

00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:25,040
it feels painfully long if you haven't

00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:25,320
found something within that first you

00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,630
know

00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:32,640
twenty seconds it's the interaction just

00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:34,980
doesn't make a lot of sense and then

00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:36,810
even this is blood over I looked at a

00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:40,500
colleague of mine who works over at Muji

00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:42,420
large e-commerce brand out of Japan the

00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:45,590
sites between you know Japan Korea and

00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:48,270
China look very similar but in reality

00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:50,310
the content is radically shifted from

00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:52,320
site to site the call to actions were

00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:54,330
quite different some products are given

00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:57,330
lists in one region they're given tiles

00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:59,910
in another at the end of the day even

00:15:57,330 --> 00:16:01,350
just saying this is the East Asian brand

00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:03,450
for Muji doesn't make a lot of sense

00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:09,030
because market to market the variations

00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:10,620
are quite stark and actually there's a

00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:13,740
great story behind why differences can

00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:16,920
be so stark go ahead to tell the funny

00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:20,040
story about it last week in New York I

00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:23,490
was doing a presentation about building

00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:26,250
a multi-platform up for one of our

00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:29,220
clients and we had a multi-site

00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:32,100
installation targeting various countries

00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:34,080
in Asia and it was pointed to us that

00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:36,210
one of the countries that we were

00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:38,400
targeting didn't have a language

00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:42,210
switcher although all of the other

00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:45,060
websites from the area had it so they

00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:47,940
asked us why is that and the answer to

00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:51,090
that would be because based on our

00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:53,460
usability tested testing and based on

00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:56,280
the local market needs this was actually

00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:58,320
a feature it was intended to be like

00:16:56,280 --> 00:17:00,720
that because we were trying to serve the

00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:03,690
local market and we're going to make a

00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:06,240
very important point here because even

00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:08,339
after you do all of your research and

00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:10,829
you do the mock-ups you do the prototype

00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:13,350
of having something to be rolled out on

00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:15,959
the market before you actually take a

00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:19,439
step and start doing the implementation

00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:21,959
and rolling out everything that you have

00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:25,650
it's important to do the usability

00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:28,140
testing get a target group of users that

00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:29,670
represents your key personas that are

00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:32,460
going to interact on the website in the

00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:34,710
future and test with them how everything

00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:36,840
is perceived how do they interact with

00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:38,049
all the elements do they understand the

00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:40,360
function and

00:17:38,049 --> 00:17:42,369
meaning behind all of them did they feel

00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:44,320
comfortable with it are they going to

00:17:42,369 --> 00:17:46,330
get back on your website or in your

00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:48,850
product or in your app to do that it

00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:51,759
really is going to provide you very

00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:54,759
valuable feedback in regards to the

00:17:51,759 --> 00:17:57,700
future success of your platform so we

00:17:54,759 --> 00:17:59,619
wanted to make that key point because if

00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:02,019
you do this at the early stages it's

00:17:59,619 --> 00:18:05,169
going to save up a lot of time in the

00:18:02,019 --> 00:18:06,730
future and a lot of money in some it

00:18:05,169 --> 00:18:08,169
actually is a feature not a bug

00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:11,169
I always look forward to one I can say

00:18:08,169 --> 00:18:13,619
that because it's not often enough but

00:18:11,169 --> 00:18:16,720
in the case Adriana was speaking about

00:18:13,619 --> 00:18:18,489
right in Japan it was very important for

00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,559
like this particular platform to look

00:18:18,489 --> 00:18:22,179
like a fully native Japanese company

00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:24,789
right it couldn't appear to be a

00:18:22,179 --> 00:18:26,859
multinational and every little element

00:18:24,789 --> 00:18:28,749
of any other language was scrubbed out

00:18:26,859 --> 00:18:30,580
all the regionalization was removed

00:18:28,749 --> 00:18:33,700
there was no way to access like the

00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:35,499
Haier brand and funny enough this plays

00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:37,450
out in a lot of you know large brand

00:18:35,499 --> 00:18:40,629
house companies right how often do you

00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:41,950
want that top-level brand exposed do we

00:18:40,629 --> 00:18:43,889
all really want to know that the same

00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:48,759
time companies owned everything we buy

00:18:43,889 --> 00:18:50,679
generally no and I know we've only got

00:18:48,759 --> 00:18:52,690
you know a couple minutes left but we do

00:18:50,679 --> 00:18:54,759
want to hit on some key pieces of like

00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:58,960
the tech stack just because it's

00:18:54,759 --> 00:19:01,809
DrupalCon trailer yeah so there's also a

00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:03,879
couple of important aspects do you think

00:19:01,809 --> 00:19:07,539
about when targeting the Asian market

00:19:03,879 --> 00:19:09,639
and one of them is of course hosting so

00:19:07,539 --> 00:19:12,070
you may want to have a decision of

00:19:09,639 --> 00:19:15,850
hosting in the area or not it's not

00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:17,649
exactly necessary depending on the type

00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:19,749
of business that you're doing so in some

00:19:17,649 --> 00:19:21,519
cases you have may have legal

00:19:19,749 --> 00:19:23,320
compliances that you need to follow it's

00:19:21,519 --> 00:19:25,029
very important to do your research to

00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:27,419
actually understand if that is a

00:19:25,029 --> 00:19:30,279
requirement or if that is a preference

00:19:27,419 --> 00:19:33,039
and then if you have a platform of

00:19:30,279 --> 00:19:36,580
choice for hosting you know maybe you

00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:40,600
want to use that for the future even if

00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:42,909
you don't host in a specific country we

00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:44,889
always recommend to use a CDN just to

00:19:42,909 --> 00:19:49,299
make sure that everything is going to be

00:19:44,889 --> 00:19:51,610
served fast and you know very nicely for

00:19:49,299 --> 00:19:55,090
everyone in different countries

00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:56,679
DLE you may want to choose a CDN service

00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:58,660
that has as many global points as

00:19:56,679 --> 00:20:01,270
possible especially in the areas where

00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:03,940
you are targeting to get more visitors

00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:07,720
from and that will ensure a better

00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:10,510
performance as always we recommend our

00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:13,240
clients to do performance testing before

00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:15,610
launching their products that will help

00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:18,850
understand what the numbers are going to

00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:22,320
look like once you go live and make sure

00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:25,030
that when you do this testing you use

00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:27,340
tools that allow you to test from that

00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:28,660
country specifically because the data is

00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:31,210
going to reflect a more accurate

00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:33,910
situation right and kind of a

00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:35,620
interesting side point there is when we

00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:37,390
do you know load and performance testing

00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:39,880
in the US right we don't just say oh

00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:41,350
we're gonna test in Omaha we usually try

00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:43,000
you know what is New York and a load

00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:44,770
like what is San Francisco going to load

00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:48,580
like you know get a much better view of

00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:50,679
the country I've seen countless times

00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:52,720
where I get a load testing report on a

00:20:50,679 --> 00:20:55,210
site and the stakeholders running well

00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,740
why is it feels slow well your testing

00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:58,090
in a city that says saw the two thousand

00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:59,559
miles away

00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:01,390
I'm sure the internet an access point

00:20:59,559 --> 00:21:03,190
there is fantastic but there's a bit of

00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:06,760
lag considering that you are in

00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:08,980
someplace quite distant so as you're

00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:10,090
choosing a CDN not all CD ends are made

00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:12,610
equally go through and actually

00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:15,760
double-check what is your core energy

00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:18,280
graphic persona rights are you looking

00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:21,190
at people in center of a country coasts

00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:22,720
you know farther inland and also do you

00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:24,340
need to actually do some optimization

00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:26,700
work to make sure those load speeds are

00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:28,809
accurate to where you're trying to serve

00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:30,580
simply just going through that usually

00:21:28,809 --> 00:21:32,110
can result in you know picking a better

00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:34,990
CDN and you know 5060 percent

00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:36,190
performance increase one thing we

00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:39,549
couldn't build into this presentation

00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:41,650
because of time is that nice study that

00:21:39,549 --> 00:21:43,419
keeps coming out that you lose what 15

00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:46,080
percent of visitors for every 900

00:21:43,419 --> 00:21:49,150
milliseconds that you don't load faster

00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:51,580
when this looks at you know global scale

00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:53,260
it's a little bit different certain

00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:56,080
regions expect four to five seconds

00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:57,520
other areas you know less than one but

00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:00,630
that's a whole separate presentation

00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,630
that we can into on another day

00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:04,870
the other point we would like to discuss

00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:06,910
about these domains again

00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:08,740
depending on the business nature and

00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:12,940
what you're trying to achieve you may

00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:16,270
want to use a more global domain or you

00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:17,740
may want to use a local one probably

00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:20,350
that's going to have an impact on the

00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:22,330
SEO in some cases as well because when

00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:24,730
you're targeting local markets that is

00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:27,100
going to be a key indicator in how you

00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:29,500
show up in the results so keep that in

00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:32,500
mind if that is an important thing for

00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:34,510
you and we want to take a moment to also

00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:37,210
discuss a little bit about the Great

00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:39,960
Firewall and some of the details that

00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:43,720
would be important to mention for that

00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:46,090
if you want to do things in China

00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:49,140
there's a couple of aspects you should

00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:52,120
be aware of if you want to host there

00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:55,240
you will need an ICP license which is

00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:57,490
usually requiring a lot of paperwork and

00:22:55,240 --> 00:23:00,550
a business entity that you need to have

00:22:57,490 --> 00:23:04,420
in China so that is something that you

00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:07,240
definitely need to be aware of if you go

00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:09,250
to any hosting providers there they will

00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:11,200
not print your hosting without having an

00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:13,960
ICP license and then you have to include

00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:16,090
that information to be present on your

00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:18,040
website to display that you have the

00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:20,500
authority to actually be present on the

00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:22,690
market now if you did not want the hosts

00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:24,490
in China it doesn't necessarily mean

00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:26,380
that you cannot host anywhere else

00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:28,870
and that your website is not going to be

00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:30,910
accessible from China it's just a

00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:33,850
difference in how you target the local

00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:35,890
market and how everything is considered

00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:37,210
from that perspective the more

00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:39,010
generalized I would say to always

00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:40,179
double-check with legal compliance for

00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:43,090
any region that you're actually trying

00:23:40,179 --> 00:23:44,830
to launch something in because there can

00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:47,050
be a lot of things that are either

00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:49,690
suggestions vs. requirements depend on

00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:51,190
where you're at even getting into small

00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:55,929
things like you know your top-level

00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:57,940
domains is edu different than ET ucn is

00:23:55,929 --> 00:23:59,350
that different than dot c n what are the

00:23:57,940 --> 00:24:02,350
different factors to consider and even

00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:04,570
applying for one of those this can take

00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:06,670
weeks and weeks or months to resolve so

00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:09,610
definitely probably plan out relatively

00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:11,140
early on what your goal is but do not

00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:12,850
leave that to the end because a lot of

00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:15,240
lovely projects I've seen over the years

00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:18,130
especially when I was working in China

00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:18,850
ended up getting launched and then not

00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:20,470
launched

00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:24,310
because someone forgot to do some

00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:27,550
paperwork a few months ago another quick

00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:29,580
comment on the slide before just before

00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:33,040
we wrap up

00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:34,330
check check the documentation and the

00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:35,890
legal paperwork that you need to

00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:37,420
actually buy domains in different

00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:39,810
countries you may need to follow

00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:43,390
different regulations for that too and

00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:47,680
based on our experience if you use an

00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:49,900
international or the C n domain for a

00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:51,880
site that is hosted outside of China you

00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:55,420
may want to double check that your DNS

00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:57,310
records are applying for the inland

00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:59,320
China as well as outside of China

00:24:57,310 --> 00:25:03,910
because otherwise your website could not

00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:07,750
be accessed by various people unless

00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:10,060
they use a VPN and actually kind of last

00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:11,200
one one axis there is make sure that for

00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:12,880
whatever region you're in the

00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:15,970
appropriate tools can be logging the

00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:17,140
activity and be accessible right this

00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:19,930
could be a whole separate presentation

00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:21,370
on its own but you know go through make

00:25:19,930 --> 00:25:22,990
sure if you're trying to track all of

00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:24,550
your like top little business goals and

00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:26,070
google analytics that they actually flow

00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:28,990
and then you don't need an alternative

00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:30,280
same for you know paid search organic

00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:31,600
search make sure you're targeting the

00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:34,830
appropriate engines that are accessible

00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:36,880
in region and the other thing we want to

00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:39,180
mention here is also when using

00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:42,280
different social media sharing

00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:44,800
functionalities or ways to present media

00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:48,550
on the website you need to adapt the

00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:51,190
local market as well because the Chinese

00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:53,350
audience may not have access to YouTube

00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:55,180
or Vimeo or tools like that so you may

00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:57,370
want to use tools that are accessible in

00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:59,710
their countries things like tencel

00:25:57,370 --> 00:26:02,560
videos yoga or some other platforms that

00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:06,610
are available there for social tools

00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:08,590
they use a lot of WeChat and there's a

00:26:06,610 --> 00:26:10,180
lot of things integrated there so you

00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:13,060
want to make sure that you tailor the

00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:15,160
experience of your platform to the local

00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:19,210
audience from the area that you're

00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:21,040
targeting and with that we have now

00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:23,370
summed up the four-hour exercise of

00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:28,570
launching in East Asia into 20 minutes

00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:30,250
any questions if you come to the mic

00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:32,550
just for this recording

00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:32,550
thank you

00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:45,110
Thanks my organization's launching a

00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:47,760
website for Japan and in my research in

00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:50,060
constructing the paths or the URLs I was

00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:54,300
got conflicting information about using

00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:56,070
you know Japanese characters in paths or

00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:59,940
you know Mandarin characters and the

00:26:56,070 --> 00:27:02,730
Chinese site do you have any best

00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:04,650
practices that you know so one kind of

00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:06,840
general note is back to like you know

00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:08,940
where you're targeting traffic Baidu

00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:11,100
actually ranks Chinese character strings

00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:13,200
heavier than you know transliteration

00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:14,400
strings so for that particular market

00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:17,610
because it has its own search engine

00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:19,400
that can be a much larger factor but in

00:27:17,610 --> 00:27:22,410
terms of Japan Adriana

00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:24,840
based on our experience we use mostly

00:27:22,410 --> 00:27:28,950
translate rate functionality because

00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:30,090
that has been easier to work with yeah

00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:31,860
and also make sure that if you're going

00:27:30,090 --> 00:27:32,970
to do that you need to have all the path

00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:34,500
set so you're rendering in the right

00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:36,300
Unicode and nothing is getting corrupted

00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:39,330
and you're getting you know large long

00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:40,830
strings that don't actually render but

00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:42,450
I'd say like the question of using a

00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:44,580
different language set outside of like

00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:46,500
the Latin character group it's most

00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:48,750
important if you're doing a site within

00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:52,100
China that you want to try ranking

00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:55,610
within Baidu I think we have time for

00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:55,610
looks like one more question

00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:04,970
question WeChat China being told that

00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:06,320
there's a lot of emphasis on using that

00:28:04,970 --> 00:28:08,810
and integrating with it well do you have

00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:10,460
any recommendations about how to bring

00:28:08,810 --> 00:28:12,230
your business bring your business into

00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:15,850
WeChat me not knowing much about it yet

00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:18,860
but yeah so actually huge incredible

00:28:15,850 --> 00:28:20,840
guide to a day in the life of a you know

00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:22,460
Chinese mobile user that actually walks

00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:23,660
you through from the time you wake up to

00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:26,360
the time you go to sleep everything you

00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:27,950
use WeChat for that's a great you know

00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:32,090
three to four page guide so you know

00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:33,710
free advertising for huge but generally

00:28:32,090 --> 00:28:35,330
speaking we chat is kind of like the app

00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:38,840
to end all apps right everything kind of

00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:40,190
integrates to it depending on if you

00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:41,540
want to do Commerce that's a very

00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:42,620
different type of integration than if

00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:45,080
you're trying to build more social

00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:46,970
traffic or if you're trying to integrate

00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:49,390
to another related service that already

00:28:46,970 --> 00:28:51,590
has like a core WeChat function built-in

00:28:49,390 --> 00:28:54,830
building micro apps with an WeChat as a

00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:56,930
whole exercise onto itself it's very

00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:59,750
rarely worth the effort but we've played

00:28:56,930 --> 00:29:01,940
around with it a few times and it's

00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:04,130
really you want to make sure that your

00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:05,930
organization has a strategy for how to

00:29:04,130 --> 00:29:08,330
do that as well because actually

00:29:05,930 --> 00:29:11,060
building out this strategy is going to

00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:12,740
take more time than implementing it so

00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:14,990
make sure everyone is aligned regarding

00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:16,520
that right and I think on a previous

00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:17,660
case we did encounter the idea that you

00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:20,210
know we chat since it acts a lot like

00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:22,240
Facebook in some ways is advertising

00:29:20,210 --> 00:29:24,650
within people who already know about you

00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:28,100
versus trying to push traffic adding

00:29:24,650 --> 00:29:29,570
garner that well I know we're out of

00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:30,770
time so thank you everyone

00:29:29,570 --> 00:29:35,720
feel free to come grab us if you have

00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:38,150
any additional questions to join the

00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:39,770
contributions I have the schedule here

00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:42,890
for when they will be happening and

00:29:39,770 --> 00:29:44,780
where and please provide the feedback on

00:29:42,890 --> 00:29:46,490
how we did on the presentation and

00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:50,020
everything else you're experiencing here

00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:50,020
