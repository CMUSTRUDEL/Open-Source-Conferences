well good morning it seems we have quite

00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:07,080
a tight schedule today so I'm gonna get

00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:09,300
started it's great to see a Content

00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:11,190
track at a content marketing content

00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:15,360
management system conference whatever

00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:20,490
next so thank you all for coming

00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:22,800
in the next 60 seconds over 500 hours of

00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:24,720
content will be published to youtube

00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:28,320
over half a million tweets will be

00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:29,910
tweeted over 65,000 photos posted to

00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,719
Instagram and around 3 and a half

00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:36,719
million Facebook posts bloody hell what

00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:37,250
a lot of content getting bigger every

00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:41,370
year

00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:44,070
my name is Mike a Burton and I do

00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:45,989
content strategy at Facebook we will

00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:47,550
circle back to my employer a little bit

00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:50,489
later but what I want to talk to you

00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:54,660
today about is a is about a practical

00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:57,899
way for marketing and content and design

00:00:54,660 --> 00:01:00,210
to all come together to deliver the

00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:02,670
right content to the right people at the

00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:05,100
right time and that comes under the

00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:07,369
banner of content strategy which has

00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:11,520
been described as putting the focus on

00:01:07,369 --> 00:01:12,990
useful and usable content and it's a

00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,760
response to this kind of content

00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:16,890
overload that we've seen and a

00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:19,200
discipline that takes a very customer

00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:22,500
focused approach to what gets published

00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,570
it online but I got to tell you I speak

00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:26,700
at a lot of content marketing events and

00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:28,680
and the content strategy community can

00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:31,020
get a bit sniffy about that they hear

00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:33,150
the words content marketing and they

00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:34,860
think of things like you know Outbrain

00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:37,070
or any other player in the kind of the

00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:39,990
bottom half of the of the internet

00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:43,200
that's not really fair is it useful and

00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:44,820
usable content shouldn't be incompatible

00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,270
with marketing certainly not content

00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:50,820
marketing marketing these days is pretty

00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:52,920
much about relationship building and

00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:54,659
when Seth Godin said the content market

00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:56,640
is the only marketing left he was

00:01:54,659 --> 00:02:00,240
talking about reaching and engaging

00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:02,100
people with quality content that happens

00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,799
all the time like air B&B with their

00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:07,409
city guides which show off their passion

00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:09,720
for travel or mailchimp with their

00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:12,630
guides to better email marketing or

00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:14,610
intercom with their books on

00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:17,340
effective customer service in all these

00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:20,310
cases these brands establish trust and

00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:22,800
authority by showing us that they care

00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:25,590
about the things that we care about they

00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:28,860
build a kind of relationship through

00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:31,620
genuinely useful and usable content so

00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:33,590
you know content strategy content

00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:37,050
marketing what's the difference

00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:39,240
gone are the days where we would just

00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:41,670
say content is king and use that as an

00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:45,360
excuse to empty out a filing cabinet

00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:48,120
full of PDFs onto the internet a whole

00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,620
bunch of custom microsites to build to

00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:51,870
and hope that people would stop by

00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:54,720
there's just too much content now and

00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:57,990
the balance of power is arguably shifted

00:02:54,720 --> 00:03:00,600
from first party siloed websites to

00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:02,670
distributed third party platforms in

00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:04,320
other words people are less likely to

00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:06,480
get your content from your own website

00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:10,020
than they are to get it from YouTube or

00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:11,790
Facebook so creating useful content is

00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:14,670
really only half the job the other half

00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:17,010
is making it easy to find and easy to

00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:20,610
make sense of and actually easy to

00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:24,990
redistribute anywhere and for that we

00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:27,660
need structure because structure creates

00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:30,180
meaning understanding how things relate

00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:32,640
to one another is how we make sense of

00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:35,250
the world is how we learn now in linear

00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,960
media like television or print we can

00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:38,250
sort of force a structure of that

00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:41,010
learning we can force a narrative

00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:43,650
structure because people only experience

00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:45,480
a story in one direction but of course

00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:47,700
with digital information that journey

00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:49,860
starts anywhere and everywhere people

00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:52,410
follow links from Facebook they type

00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:54,150
their searches into Google and they

00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:56,400
arrive right into the middle ebook your

00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:58,230
content and wherever they land usually a

00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:01,020
specific page of content rather than a

00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:02,700
sort of index homepage or anything you

00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:04,410
go just a couple of seconds to reassure

00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:06,120
them that they're in the right place

00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:08,220
this is the Droid they're looking for

00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:10,680
and that they understand that how the

00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:14,370
thing that they're looking at connects

00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:16,500
to that bigger structural picture but

00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:18,720
often it's not really there that often

00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:21,720
that structure that wider context is

00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:24,240
actually only implied by the way that

00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:25,040
the pages of a site or an app or arrange

00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,650
something like

00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:31,460
this the good old-fashioned hierarchical

00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:33,560
sitemap links and classification they

00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:35,750
come from the navigation that's been

00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:38,830
added to the UI but there's no explicit

00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:40,940
connections inherent within the actual

00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:43,250
elements of content if you see what I

00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:45,680
mean no connection for example between

00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:47,840
the new and used variants of a

00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:50,660
three-door mini even though they're

00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:53,600
cognitively the same thing all of the

00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:58,010
structure is on the page but it isn't in

00:04:53,600 --> 00:05:00,380
the content by contrast when those

00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:02,090
structural connections are inherent to

00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:04,760
the content well then any and every

00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:06,710
interface will do when we see these

00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:08,810
sidebars in our Google results of course

00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:11,480
there's constructed automatically by a

00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:13,640
computer and that's possible because all

00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:15,110
of these little bits of content actually

00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:18,440
from a bunch of different places around

00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:21,410
the web of all explicitly asserted

00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:23,930
through their metadata that they refer

00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:27,680
to a specific TV show in this case

00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:29,780
Portlandia so I wrote a book about all

00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,760
this stuff recently with my friend Kerry

00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:33,830
Haines it's called designing connected

00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:37,790
content and it's based on work that

00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:40,220
we've done BBC for air sea for British

00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:43,640
Parliament and others it's a practical

00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:46,820
guide to what we see as better content

00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:49,220
management but what's connected content

00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:52,910
well I like to think of it as content

00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:55,820
with built in context on a human level

00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:57,860
it's connected to the things that matter

00:05:55,820 --> 00:06:00,620
to people it's broken down according to

00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:04,100
how people think and on a technical

00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:07,070
level it has us a richly into / and very

00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:09,590
granular structure it scales up without

00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:11,120
breaking because that rigid hierarchy we

00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:14,180
that we usually impose through how

00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:17,030
sitemaps and the like rather than doing

00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:18,800
that we recognize that reality is sort

00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:21,010
of far more tangled and wibbly-wobbly

00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:23,900
and it sort of resists constraint and

00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:26,090
most importantly of all the both the

00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:28,220
content and the structure are stored

00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:30,650
outside of any specific interface

00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:33,440
they're not pages but they're chunks of

00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:33,900
content that can be used to compose page

00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,300
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:40,410
plus we shouldn't be news at a Drupal

00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:42,630
conference but they set this separation

00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:45,000
of resources content chunks and the

00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:47,820
representations the interfaces in which

00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,220
they appear makes your content ready

00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:52,919
well for any interface even those that

00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:54,870
are yet to be invented so I'd like to

00:06:52,919 --> 00:06:57,930
share this process with you now but it

00:06:54,870 --> 00:07:02,130
begins with an inconvenient truth about

00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:05,880
your content which is that nobody really

00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:08,070
cares about your content sorry but it's

00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:11,460
true I mean no matter how glossy the

00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:14,340
production values the content is really

00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:16,590
just a means to an end so what is it

00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:18,750
that people do care about well

00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:21,210
they care about stuff they care about

00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:24,120
celebrities and cars and theme parks and

00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:27,449
movies and bands and recipes and pension

00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:29,699
plans and landmarks whenever somebody's

00:07:27,449 --> 00:07:31,139
engaging with your content is because

00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:32,280
they have an itch to scratch though

00:07:31,139 --> 00:07:34,110
they're buying a house or they're

00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:36,449
planning a pensioner they're considering

00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:38,820
a new car and that's where content

00:07:36,449 --> 00:07:40,860
becomes useful content provides

00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:43,139
information about the world around us it

00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:47,520
describes and defines and discusses and

00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:50,070
even debates things and ideas concepts

00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:55,530
and people and places it furnishes us

00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:58,740
with facts so it's not your content

00:07:55,530 --> 00:08:00,830
that's important what really matters are

00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:03,120
the things that your content is about

00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:05,370
now that's a subtle distinction but it's

00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,800
a very important one to make compelling

00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:09,720
content we need to figure out the

00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:12,990
specific types of things within a

00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:16,080
subject area and then make content about

00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:18,419
each of those things so let's go find

00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:20,669
some things well to do that we need to

00:08:18,419 --> 00:08:23,310
focus on a subject what subject shall we

00:08:20,669 --> 00:08:26,639
have maybe music like Spotify like

00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:29,400
outdoor pursuits like REI small business

00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:30,990
management like fresh books well if it

00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:32,940
were music well what does a music

00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:35,190
audience talk about when they talk about

00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:37,740
music well this thing's like the bands

00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:39,330
and the artists and the songs and the

00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:42,180
recordings and the album's and the

00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:44,970
record labels and the tours so to make

00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:47,100
content to support a subject make

00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:49,949
content specifically about

00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:53,209
the things in that subject what is it

00:08:49,949 --> 00:08:57,209
that your customers truly care about

00:08:53,209 --> 00:08:59,730
that's your subject domain now in the

00:08:57,209 --> 00:09:01,199
book we use a fairly simple subject of a

00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:04,470
in the world of conferences much like

00:09:01,199 --> 00:09:06,389
this one Kari and I led the content

00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:09,690
strategy for the ia summit now the ia

00:09:06,389 --> 00:09:11,670
conference which is a 20 year old annual

00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:14,790
community conference about information

00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:17,190
architecture rock and roll huh

00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:19,589
now it attracts some very high-value

00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:21,329
session content which actually stays

00:09:19,589 --> 00:09:23,579
relevant for years and years and years

00:09:21,329 --> 00:09:27,870
because it's kind of a bit in a

00:09:23,579 --> 00:09:30,089
bit like infrastructural but as an event

00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:31,649
it's kind of scrappy it's kind of a low

00:09:30,089 --> 00:09:35,190
budget event that's run by volunteers

00:09:31,649 --> 00:09:37,860
and get this year after year when it

00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:40,440
came to their website a volunteer would

00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:41,850
would come in volunteer crew come in

00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:44,639
build the one-off website for that

00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:45,779
year's event and then when it was over

00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:46,949
they would throw it all away and the

00:09:45,779 --> 00:09:50,190
next bunch of volunteers would come in

00:09:46,949 --> 00:09:53,279
and build the next year's website which

00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:54,870
is madness but perhaps not entirely

00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:58,079
unfamiliar to anyone who's been through

00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:59,790
a corporate redesign we wanted to change

00:09:58,079 --> 00:10:02,839
all that we wanted a once and for all

00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:06,930
digital presence for the entire brand

00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:08,579
distinct from particular annual events

00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:11,220
and able to accommodate every annual

00:10:08,579 --> 00:10:13,769
event into the future as part of a

00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:17,220
larger structure so we spoke to some

00:10:13,769 --> 00:10:20,370
people close to the event and figured

00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:22,199
out you know what the most important

00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:25,470
things but what was it that people

00:10:22,199 --> 00:10:27,569
wanted to to know about and they told us

00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:29,519
they want to know who's speaking and

00:10:27,569 --> 00:10:31,350
what they're speaking about they want to

00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:33,839
know when and where the conference is

00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:35,490
and how far away is it from the city and

00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:37,620
it turns out that while they're at the

00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:39,630
conference they want to use the website

00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:42,660
on their phones as a portable time table

00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:44,819
with details of when and where each

00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:47,459
session is held and on some conferences

00:10:44,819 --> 00:10:49,680
that can be quite a challenge and as any

00:10:47,459 --> 00:10:51,660
any conference planner will tell you all

00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,880
that information about sessions and

00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:56,579
speakers and times and dates can and

00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:59,520
will change up to and beyond the last

00:10:56,579 --> 00:11:02,250
minute now all of this might sound

00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:04,860
obvious but as we know without a plan

00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:07,170
it's far too easy for brands and

00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:08,940
organizations to start to lose their way

00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:11,279
and start crowding out all the good

00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:14,279
stuff with all kinds of irrelevant

00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:16,740
vanity junk about their brand story and

00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:20,360
their sort of values and things that are

00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:23,610
of no interest to anybody but themselves

00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:25,980
so instead we to try and stay focused we

00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:30,360
did a lot of interviews of which this is

00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:31,980
a fictional transcript and we listened

00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:33,240
out for the things that people were

00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:34,470
talking about when they were telling us

00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:37,230
about the event what were the most

00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:40,050
important things and whenever they throw

00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:41,640
out a noun or a verb we lepton it and we

00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:43,260
questioned like what is it that you

00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:45,510
meant how is a conference event

00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:47,220
different to the conference what has a

00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:48,990
lightening taco type of talk what are

00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:50,370
the other types of talks beakers and

00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:53,880
keynotes okay are there two different

00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:55,589
classes of participant sessions and

00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:57,120
social events is a social event is that

00:11:55,589 --> 00:12:00,000
a session or is it not is a different

00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:02,160
kind of thing volunteers how do they fit

00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,510
into the whole big picture sponsors what

00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,760
can they sponsor are they sponsor the

00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:08,690
entire then are they sponsoring sessions

00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,690
how does it all work

00:12:08,899 --> 00:12:13,829
and so we listed these things out people

00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:16,110
wanted stuff about as I say about each

00:12:13,829 --> 00:12:17,579
person each session each event and then

00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:19,350
some of the things like the thematic

00:12:17,579 --> 00:12:20,820
track and the format of each session

00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:23,640
which would help the other things make

00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:26,130
more sense these would be the building

00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:28,529
blocks of our content strategy and it

00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:33,930
keeps the focus on that useful and

00:12:28,529 --> 00:12:36,029
usable content so we've located the

00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:37,890
latter though the points of interest but

00:12:36,029 --> 00:12:41,160
now we need a map to figure out how to

00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:43,380
travel from one to the other organizing

00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:45,810
information actually creates new

00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:48,270
information of its own how something is

00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:51,660
classified or named affects how we

00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:52,920
interpret it content marketing as far as

00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:55,290
I'm concerned is supposed to be

00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:57,930
educational more so than promotional and

00:12:55,290 --> 00:13:01,740
therefore the learning comes from the

00:12:57,930 --> 00:13:04,380
links between items of content if we

00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:07,709
make the connections between the stuff

00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:09,959
in our domain our domain entities make

00:13:07,709 --> 00:13:12,480
those match up how they match up and

00:13:09,959 --> 00:13:13,230
interrelate in reality the structure

00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,540
itself they

00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:17,670
does the hard work of helping a visit to

00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:20,340
make sense of how the everything fits

00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:21,630
together learning in the links what do I

00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:24,870
mean by that well if you think back to

00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:27,150
the Oscars and the connection between

00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:31,140
Bohemian Rhapsody and the Best Picture

00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:32,760
Oscar well it was a nominee whereas

00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:35,070
green book by the other you know same

00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:37,580
kind of entities different kind of

00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:40,230
relationship this time it was a winner

00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:41,880
well this needs to Snow White

00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:43,980
often thought of as the director

00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:45,840
actually the producer so there's an

00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:48,240
important information that is contained

00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:52,830
within the link between two different

00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:55,650
concepts this comes together in a

00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:57,720
technique called domain modeling which

00:13:55,650 --> 00:13:59,490
is stolen from software engineering and

00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:02,520
has no place in the content mark sync

00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:06,270
track but hopefully it does a domain

00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:08,400
model is a logical concept model of how

00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:10,380
a subject hangs together now these

00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:12,690
connections they might look a little bit

00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:14,930
wibbly-wobbly but that's alright because

00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:19,050
each connection has that named

00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:20,520
description of its own showing us for

00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:22,830
example that each event is part of the

00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:25,350
master brand that a person can be

00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:27,930
assigned a role say a speaker or a

00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:30,210
keynote or a volunteer and there's a

00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:31,980
connection making it clearer than what a

00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:34,170
sponsor could be associated with an

00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:36,660
entire event or just an individual

00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:39,000
session of which it has a subtype social

00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:40,890
session such as the karaoke or the happy

00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,180
hour and that kind of thing it takes a

00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:44,040
bit of getting used to for sure but

00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:47,970
actually it's a fairly simple model and

00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:49,860
yet it's powerful and reusable enough to

00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:53,700
hold true for that conference and

00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:57,060
arguably any conference now and into the

00:14:53,700 --> 00:15:00,180
future so whatever your subject area you

00:14:57,060 --> 00:15:03,540
can express it some subject as a domain

00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:08,190
model things like restaurants or indeed

00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:12,210
live music or indeed my favorites theme

00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:13,800
parks getting it right is very much a

00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:16,560
team effort but once you've got it it's

00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:19,230
a super useful shared picture something

00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:22,050
that your designers developers content

00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:23,760
creation people can all refer to it's a

00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:27,279
common language and a common

00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:31,430
understanding of how your world

00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:34,550
but how do we go from this abstract

00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:38,240
model on paper to truly connect it to

00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:40,040
digital content that's where we face up

00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:45,860
to the content management system and the

00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:47,690
inconvenient truth number two system

00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:50,839
what a thing to say a Drupal come my

00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:52,820
goodness all happy CMS's are alike but

00:15:50,839 --> 00:15:55,550
all unhappy ones are unhappy in

00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:58,010
different ways like when you're given

00:15:55,550 --> 00:16:00,649
this so-called WYSIWYG editor with a box

00:15:58,010 --> 00:16:04,700
to enter the name of your page and

00:16:00,649 --> 00:16:07,160
another box for everything else this is

00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:08,899
how the i/o summit used to manage

00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:10,430
session pages from their conference all

00:16:08,899 --> 00:16:12,290
the relevant information is there but

00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:14,720
it's only really there to the human eye

00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:17,200
you can see the names and the faces of

00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:19,430
the session host Karl and Christina here

00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:22,310
but there's nothing going on behind the

00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:24,649
scenes to tell you or to tell the CMS

00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:26,330
that these are specific people holding

00:16:24,649 --> 00:16:29,990
the role of speaker at this specific

00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:31,940
event though names are linked presumably

00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:35,630
to their profile pages but again it's

00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:39,740
all done by hand we see when and where

00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:41,690
the session takes place but again it's

00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:42,529
like it's static text that's all done by

00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:44,870
hand

00:16:42,529 --> 00:16:46,880
and if anything had to change about this

00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:49,760
session different people different title

00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:51,740
different room or anything all of those

00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:54,410
changes would have to be made everywhere

00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:57,740
that this information has been created

00:16:54,410 --> 00:17:00,680
and stored so the content is good but it

00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:02,450
lacks structure it's not connected now

00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:04,520
fortunately we've you've guessed it we

00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:06,589
have a model that maps out exactly how

00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:08,179
those things should connect all we need

00:17:06,589 --> 00:17:09,980
to do is teach that model to the

00:17:08,179 --> 00:17:13,339
computer and thankfully things like

00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:15,829
Drupal and other headless CMS products

00:17:13,339 --> 00:17:18,110
like contentful and a whole bunch I've

00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:20,720
become a bit more evolved so rather than

00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:22,910
thinking in a series of complete pages

00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:24,949
they help you manage individual content

00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:28,130
chunks and a chunk can represent

00:17:24,949 --> 00:17:30,380
something in our model a chunk for a

00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:32,090
person or a chunk for a session or so on

00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:34,130
actually those chunks are a little bit

00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:36,210
too chunky so we can we can break them

00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:40,090
down even more

00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:42,310
why can't we yes we can't like a person

00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:44,200
who has a name and a face and in our

00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:46,420
world they have a job title in a bio and

00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:48,970
some contact information and we can link

00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:51,310
the person to the role that they hold at

00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:54,370
the event and if that role is a speaking

00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:57,940
role we can link them to each session

00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:59,290
that they present any small or granular

00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:02,170
chunks are a lot more useful we can use

00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:05,860
them as ingredients for any kind of view

00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:07,870
that we can imagine so what do we go

00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:10,150
we've got a model for our content that's

00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:13,540
based on a deep understanding of our

00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:16,300
subject domain we can configure our CMS

00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:18,480
to allow the entry of each content chunk

00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:21,250
and with that configuration also

00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,960
handling how the chunks relate to one

00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:25,270
another

00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:26,740
now our CMS can look something like this

00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:29,890
which is actually an early builder

00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:32,260
Drupal 8 unlike the old way all that

00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:34,840
body information is now breaking broken

00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:37,750
down into separate chunks some of them

00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:41,010
even readable by the computer like for

00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:49,090
example the session start and end times

00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:51,970
and if we associate this session with a

00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:54,850
presenter we're just making a connection

00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:57,720
between this sort of session object over

00:18:54,850 --> 00:19:00,520
here and that person objects over there

00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:02,650
and if we need to sort of change the

00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:04,690
presenter for any reason or change their

00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:06,490
name which happens all the time

00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:08,680
we can do so without break and rid the

00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:10,660
relationship to the session if they

00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:12,220
present more sessions at this event or

00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:13,690
in the future ones we can just pick them

00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:16,030
again from the roster and add them to

00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:18,010
the new talk which has a built the the

00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:20,170
add advantage of building up a useful

00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:22,330
picture of their speaking career and it

00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:24,760
doesn't matter if we have one session or

00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:27,580
a thousand sessions or one event or 50

00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:29,430
events the structural integrity holds

00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:34,480
because it's based on those real-world

00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:37,060
relationships so with a CMS all set up

00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:39,370
adding content now becomes pretty easy

00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:41,830
we know exactly what piece of content

00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:44,590
each piece Condors should be about right

00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:47,650
down to the last chunk and through the

00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:49,510
model we've agreed what's most useful to

00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:49,809
our audience if it's an object in the

00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:52,090
mod

00:19:49,809 --> 00:19:54,249
we should have some contents to support

00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:57,609
it if it isn't we shouldn't pretty

00:19:54,249 --> 00:20:00,369
simple the content has become truly

00:19:57,609 --> 00:20:01,330
connected within the CMS and not just on

00:20:00,369 --> 00:20:03,729
the page

00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:09,279
all of these chunks of content can be

00:20:03,729 --> 00:20:11,710
remixed and reused endlessly like this

00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:13,179
schedule play page for example well we

00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:15,729
just need to use a few of those chunks

00:20:13,179 --> 00:20:18,129
view those fields for each listing and

00:20:15,729 --> 00:20:21,340
in fact as we pointed out before because

00:20:18,129 --> 00:20:23,830
the computer knows when and what each

00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:25,869
session starts and ends it can compile

00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:29,279
this schedule list automatically and if

00:20:25,869 --> 00:20:32,320
session times change the list will be

00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:34,570
automatically as well or this speaker

00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:36,669
page where people who are assigned the

00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:38,440
role of keno get a slightly bigger

00:20:36,669 --> 00:20:42,039
slightly more important headshot at the

00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:44,739
top of the list because of that little

00:20:42,039 --> 00:20:46,330
metadata flag that's been told the

00:20:44,739 --> 00:20:48,759
computer that there are keno and not

00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:50,649
just a regular speaker this page isn't

00:20:48,759 --> 00:20:53,049
laid out by hand therefore it's sort of

00:20:50,649 --> 00:20:56,739
powered by the magic that comes in the

00:20:53,049 --> 00:20:59,440
model with your world of structured

00:20:56,739 --> 00:21:03,489
content already in place content becomes

00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:06,190
therefore a design material your richly

00:21:03,489 --> 00:21:08,409
linked structure it represents a

00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:09,729
real-world area of interest now we can

00:21:08,409 --> 00:21:13,029
and so now we can think of each

00:21:09,729 --> 00:21:15,609
interface be it mobile desktop Google

00:21:13,029 --> 00:21:18,219
sidebar or whatever as a window that

00:21:15,609 --> 00:21:21,700
looks through onto that same world of

00:21:18,219 --> 00:21:23,409
structured content beneath and I think

00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:26,320
that's much better why it's much better

00:21:23,409 --> 00:21:28,749
to do interface design so after all that

00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:32,619
structural work starting content

00:21:28,749 --> 00:21:34,899
strategy from a UI wireframe well it's a

00:21:32,619 --> 00:21:37,210
bit like writing a novel by starting at

00:21:34,899 --> 00:21:40,169
the book binding or taking a scatter

00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:42,820
cushion first approach to architecture

00:21:40,169 --> 00:21:44,769
wireframes crushed together so many

00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:47,529
different concerns of content and

00:21:44,769 --> 00:21:49,119
navigation and decoration before often

00:21:47,529 --> 00:21:51,539
before we've even really had a chance to

00:21:49,119 --> 00:21:53,799
think of any of them separately

00:21:51,539 --> 00:21:56,080
wireframes also often deal with like

00:21:53,799 --> 00:21:57,879
ideal world content with that big hero

00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:00,129
image that looks fantastic when it's a

00:21:57,879 --> 00:22:00,530
big celebrity close up but pretty bad on

00:22:00,129 --> 00:22:02,450
slow

00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:05,510
days when you've got a business stock

00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:07,940
photo instead but having to invest it in

00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:10,010
our structural designer from all these

00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:13,340
architectural decisions are effectively

00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:16,160
already made and already agreed with the

00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:18,020
team so each interface now becomes a

00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:20,990
series of templates recipes that are

00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:23,690
made up from the ingredients of our

00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:25,730
content chunks and these carry of course

00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:28,370
connections to the related chunks which

00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:30,830
weaves that content more more tightly

00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:32,750
together and if the content actually is

00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:34,490
already in place in your CMS by the time

00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:37,430
you get into this this sort of interface

00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:40,280
design any good UI designer can use live

00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:44,030
actual content to power their their

00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:46,910
prototype templates here's the BBC food

00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:48,880
sites I worked on many years ago now but

00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:52,550
now develop using this other tank

00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:56,540
connected content idea the model had

00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:58,940
things like recipe chef diets ingredient

00:22:56,540 --> 00:23:01,160
TV show all of which you can record

00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:03,560
start to see these represented in the in

00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:05,240
the main navigation but actually all of

00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:08,120
these are just exploring the same

00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:09,640
database of of recipe content through a

00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:12,710
different lens

00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:14,930
each chef object has a name and a photo

00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:17,720
in a bio and its associated one or more

00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:19,010
recipes on the mobile UI by contrast

00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:21,320
they had to make a different design

00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:25,220
choice only showing the name of each

00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:27,260
chef following Nigella here returns all

00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:30,170
of our recipes a recipe a list of course

00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:31,490
that set capsule today automatically but

00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:32,810
these are the resources that get the

00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:35,120
most traffic this is where people are

00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:38,150
jumping through from google to specific

00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:40,220
recipe pages when somebody lands here of

00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:42,230
course they've got to see not only the

00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:44,570
content that they've come for but also

00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:47,300
the surrounding context that gives it

00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:48,950
meaning once again the content and its

00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:53,690
structural relationships are stored

00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:56,240
outside of this UI this page so HTML web

00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:57,980
pages are just one possible output if

00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:00,560
you what really want to get technical

00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:03,230
about it you could send your structured

00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:04,850
content outputted as say a JSON file and

00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:08,180
it's cheap and easy to send that same

00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:11,450
content to a smart phone or a smart

00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:13,250
watch app to digital signage to voice

00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:15,170
you eyes like the echo or

00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:19,430
even two third party platforms like

00:24:15,170 --> 00:24:20,960
Google or indeed Facebook for each

00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:23,180
interface you can actually make

00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:25,760
different design choices about which

00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:28,750
content chunks to include and how to

00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:31,100
display them something that we do in

00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:33,650
Facebook instant articles a little word

00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:35,120
from my sponsor the Facebook developers

00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:39,680
site has got all the information that

00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:41,560
you need to set up the CMS set of Drupal

00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:45,050
in this case for a publishing content

00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:47,150
directly to the Facebook platform as an

00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:49,100
instant article it's really just a case

00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:50,750
of pasting a bit of code into a template

00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:54,920
head here and you're all ready to to

00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:59,740
reach two billion users now structured

00:24:54,920 --> 00:25:02,830
content is of course not new but

00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:06,230
sometimes the design of that structure

00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:07,850
can happen without due consideration as

00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:10,720
and as we've seen the structure actually

00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:14,150
drives the rest of the design

00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:16,550
Jared spool the UX guy topped Cole's

00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:18,230
designed the rendering of intent now our

00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:21,020
intent is to build an audience through

00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:23,450
useful and usable content but the stuff

00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:26,210
that makes it useful and usable isn't

00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:29,360
only in the content it's also in the

00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:31,850
structure some of the learning is it is

00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:34,340
in how the content is in is broken down

00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:37,310
and connected so that it follows that

00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:39,200
human mental model and it maps to the

00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:43,490
things that people are searching for and

00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:47,690
the way people think so to sum up

00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:50,450
content connected content helps brand

00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:52,940
alignment no more random acts of

00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:56,270
marketing you can make the most of what

00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:59,200
you've already got by freeing it from an

00:25:56,270 --> 00:26:02,060
interface and weaving it into a useful

00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:05,120
nonlinear narrative you can improve

00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:06,680
efficiency by making content only for

00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,940
the things that are in the model because

00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:09,050
all of the things that your constant

00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:11,750
that your audience are telling you

00:26:09,050 --> 00:26:14,390
they're interested in you can make your

00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:16,580
next redesign a little bit less painful

00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:19,250
because when your contents all connected

00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:22,220
under the hood a UI refresh is really

00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:23,660
just that and you can be nice to your

00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:25,880
customers by giving the right

00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:26,450
information on every touch point even

00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:28,070
though

00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:30,140
forms that you don't control whether

00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:33,170
it's a Facebook or Google or Twitter or

00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:35,930
phones or watches or internet fridges

00:26:33,170 --> 00:26:40,130
which used to be a thing you can put

00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:42,110
your content where the audience is and

00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:45,260
you keep you can manage it centrally and

00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:47,510
share it broadly you know you'll be more

00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:51,110
places at once while still keeping

00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:52,670
control of your brand so remember find

00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:55,310
the things that matter to your audience

00:26:52,670 --> 00:26:57,470
map that world and reflect it back to

00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:59,900
them use it to connect all of your

00:26:57,470 --> 00:27:03,500
content chunks and then spread it far

00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:05,480
and wide to create all the interfaces

00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:07,940
that you like it's all powered by the

00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:11,570
same content and importantly the same

00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:14,690

all selling something but people care

00:27:14,690 --> 00:27:19,040
about what they care about and you have

00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:21,130
a better shot at reaching them if you

00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:24,020
can show that you care about that to

00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:27,140
connect your content and then use it to

00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:28,670
