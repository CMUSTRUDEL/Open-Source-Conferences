Title: DrupalCon Seattle 2019: Keeping That New Car Smell: Tips for Publishing Accessible Content
Publication date: 2019-04-11
Playlist: Drupalcon Seattle 2019
Description: 
	You just received the keys to your new site, and you can’t wait to test out all of its new bells and whistles. Custom landing pages! Dynamic case studies! Beautiful event listings! With all of your site’s new capabilities, you’re about to unlock a world of possibility for reaching your visitors in exciting ways - ALL of your visitors.

Although web accessibility begins on a foundation built by content strategists, designers, and engineers, the buck does not stop there (or at site launch). Content editors play a huge role in maintaining web accessibility standards as they publish new content over time.

Attendees of this session will leave with an understanding of:

Examples of how users might be consuming your content and what that means for you as a marketer

Tips for writing descriptive text, maintaining proper hierarchy on a page, and utilizing Drupal 8’s accessibility parameters

Tools you can use to continuously monitor how your content measures up to accessibility standards



This session is for anyone who publishes or edits content in Drupal.

thank you for joining us this is

00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:09,059

00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:11,580
small room so I hope everyone has enough

00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:12,870
elbow room here thank you so much for

00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:15,120
joining us we're really excited to talk

00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:16,920
to you about this topic today our talk

00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,960
is called keeping that new-car smell

00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:24,660
tips for publishing accessible content

00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:26,640
and it's only slightly about cars so we

00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:29,400
have let's see if we can figure out how

00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,449
to advance the slide there we go we have

00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,610
the slide in here because we're supposed

00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:33,960
to I'm sure lots of us are marketers and

00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:35,790
have no technical abilities whatsoever

00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:37,770
but if you can contribute to the Drupal

00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:39,180
community please do it's very important

00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:41,309
to give back to the open source

00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:45,440
community Alex and I are both actually

00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:47,399
in Drupal Camp organizations locally and

00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:50,340
found out that you can actually get

00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:51,719
drupal.org credits as marketers helping

00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:53,129
out with that sort of thing so in case

00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:55,680
y'all didn't know that as marketers you

00:00:53,129 --> 00:00:58,109
can get that street cred I recommend you

00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:00,510
try it out if you can so quickly before

00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:02,399
we begin I just wanted to let you know

00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:05,250

out of Chicago and we actually all work

00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:15,119

Portland and I'm based in Denver we work

00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:19,110
with clients in the healthcare the

00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:21,689
nonprofit higher ed government spaces

00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:26,580
experiences and empower them to achieve

00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:28,770
their missions so I'm the sales manager

00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:31,079
at Palantir net my name is Nelson Harris

00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:33,329
I work with our clients and liaise with

00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:36,509
our team to help figure out the best

00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:38,640
solutions for our clients problems hi

00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:41,040
I'm Alex Brant the marketing manager at

00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,659
Palantir I've been in the Drupal world

00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,399
for the last five years and I've been

00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:46,079
publishing all volunteers content for

00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:48,540
the last three years on our website and

00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:50,189
elsewhere online my background is in

00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:51,840
journalism so a lot of my prior

00:01:50,189 --> 00:01:54,060
knowledge about content marketing was

00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,610
more relating to SEO rather than in

00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:59,040
publishing up to accessibility standards

00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:00,719
so now as a non-technical member of a

00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,130
highly technical team it's been pretty

00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:04,770
enlightening learning from our team of

00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:06,540
accessibility experts I'm by no means an

00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:07,560
accessibility expert myself but today I

00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:10,950
wanted to share some of the things that

00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:12,180
I've learned along the way today we'll

00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:13,920
be talking about what access

00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:15,450
accessibility is and why

00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,860
important we'll go over a couple of ways

00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:19,230
that users might be consuming your

00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:20,940
content will share our 10 tips for

00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:22,200
publishing accessible content and then

00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:24,030
we'll also talk about how technology

00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,640
helps so some of the parameters that

00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:30,180
Drupal has built-in and then some of the

00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:32,310
tools that we use so let's start with

00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:34,200
the basics web accessibility means that

00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:36,510
people with disabilities can perceive

00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:38,190
understand navigate and interact with

00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:40,769
the web and that they can contribute to

00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:44,069
the web one in four Americans are

00:02:40,769 --> 00:02:45,569
disabled that's 61 million people some

00:02:44,069 --> 00:02:47,459
of the common disabilities you might

00:02:45,569 --> 00:02:49,170
think of as people who are affected by

00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:51,660
web accessibility might be people with

00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:53,310
low vision or blindness or deafness but

00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:54,840
web accessibility also affects those

00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:56,880
with temporary or situational

00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:58,739
disabilities this might be someone who's

00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:00,209
working from a crowded coffee shop and

00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:02,400
has a slow internet connection or

00:03:00,209 --> 00:03:04,319
someone who's working from a crowded

00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,910
conference area and they're either

00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:07,290
surrounded by distractions or they don't

00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:10,590
want to become a distraction themselves

00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:12,330
by playing audio out loud so why is

00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:14,069
accessibility important to us as

00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:15,540
marketers a lot of us in the agency

00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:17,670
world work on pretty lean marketing

00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:19,019
teams at Palantir you could consider our

00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:20,910
marketing team to be one and a half

00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:22,260
people that's me and then Nelson

00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:24,269
whenever I can steal some of its time

00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:26,100
that means that every aspect of our

00:03:24,269 --> 00:03:27,180
efforts needs to be optimized in order

00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:29,790
for us to reach our goals

00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:31,290
so if someone isn't seeing a blog post

00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:34,190
or cassadee that you published or

00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:40,140
listening to a podcast you don't want to

00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:41,310
use a marketer don't sorry it doesn't

00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:42,930
mean that you as a marketer don't care

00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:44,310
about delivering that information to

00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:45,510
those audiences it just means that you

00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:47,579
have to adapt in the way that you are

00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:49,260
delivering them so accessible websites

00:03:47,579 --> 00:03:50,940
have better search results reduce

00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:52,500
maintenance costs and increase audience

00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:56,239
reach and then there might be legal

00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:58,650
ramifications for ignoring accessibility

00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:00,390
so yeah if you decided to join us today

00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:01,680
for this talk I assume you probably

00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:04,380
realize that accessibility is really

00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,000
important perhaps you were tasked within

00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:07,410
your organization sorry if you can't

00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,930
hear let me know but I got to kind of do

00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:11,940
this thing these mics are not tall

00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:13,799
enough for me so you may be you've been

00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:15,959
tasked with publishing accessible

00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:17,400
content within your organization and I

00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:19,079
think a lot of these kind of talks and

00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:22,140
and in those kind of environments we

00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:23,430
talk a lot about wicked standards and to

00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:25,380
the letter sort of how to follow

00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:27,100
accessibility standards but we wanted to

00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:29,080
do in this presentation was just

00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:30,790
contextualize it a little bit and talk

00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:33,130
about some of the ways that people are

00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:34,990
actually consuming your content when

00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:37,180
you're publishing for the accessible web

00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:38,710
so two ways that people with

00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:40,600
disabilities are going to consume your

00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:42,640
content are through what's called an

00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:44,500
assistive technology or by using an

00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:46,480
adaptive strategy so an assistive

00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:48,550
technology is something like a screen

00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:50,350
reader or a screen magnifier and an

00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:51,970
adaptive strategy is more of a technique

00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:54,190
that they might use to make the

00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:57,070
interaction better like zooming in or

00:04:54,190 --> 00:05:00,910
reducing their mouth speed or making the

00:04:57,070 --> 00:05:02,320
text larger on a page so since we're

00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:04,170
about to share a bunch of those to the

00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:06,730
letter how to follow accessibility rules

00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:09,190
thought it might be great to take a look

00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:11,290
at actually what it looks like to use an

00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:13,060
assistive technology how many by a show

00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:16,090
of hands in this room have actually ever

00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:17,890
seen a blind person interact with with a

00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:19,270
screen reader before okay so a little

00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:21,190
looks like a little less than half I

00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:23,170
actually had never before we started the

00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:25,150
preparation for this talk and I found

00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:27,460
this short YouTube video it's just gonna

00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:28,630
be like a 20-second clip but I wanted to

00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:30,430
share it because I think it's really

00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:32,140
critical to actually if you haven't seen

00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:34,750
this to see how it works so let's let's

00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:38,380
watch example I could just keep reading

00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:41,470
banner of three items visited link image

00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:43,840
home line by line and we could be here

00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:45,730
all day or I could jump to the first

00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,920
heading on the page heading level to

00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:50,500
search for heading level two you are

00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:53,140
here heading level one videos accessible

00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:54,730
so as I'm moving down through the page I

00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:57,280
can look for the category that interests

00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:58,540
me so super short clip but you can see

00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,400
how the screen reader is actually

00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:02,080
focusing on different heading levels and

00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,670
calling them out goes to the things

00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,350
we're gonna talk about about semantic

00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:07,120
markup and heading hierarchy and all

00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:09,610
these things which get really just sort

00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,210
of become like oh yeah of course you're

00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:11,620
supposed to do that

00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:13,210
but I thought this was so great to kind

00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:17,230
of see how how somebody actually

00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:20,460
interacts with that stuff if I can find

00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:20,460
my cursor we'll proceed

00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:34,860
so how do you keep that new car smell

00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:36,360
say you're just handed the keys to your

00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:38,280
new website and after months of your

00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:39,510
team of designers and developers working

00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:41,670
really hard to make sure that they're

00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:43,680
building and designing everything with

00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:45,330
accessibility in mind now it's up to you

00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:48,180
to maintain that level of accessibility

00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:50,040
for your users we compiled our list of

00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:51,960
tips from a few different resources

00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:54,270
online and including the wicked

00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:58,110
standards w3c and then our team at

00:06:54,270 --> 00:07:01,110
Palantir our first tip is to provide

00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:02,250
meaningful text alternatives text

00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:04,350
alternatives should help your audience

00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:06,450
understand the content in context of

00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:07,880
each image video or audio clip it also

00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:09,840
makes that information available to

00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:13,350
technology that can't see or hear your

00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:15,180
content like a search engine so for

00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:17,340
images you can provide alternative text

00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:18,540
this is especially important if you do a

00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:20,700
lot of email marketing because

00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:21,600
accessibility aside if you have an email

00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:23,640
that you're sending out with a lot of

00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:25,440
images and someone has images turned off

00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:27,540
to preserve data you want to make sure

00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:29,610
that your email still makes sense for

00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:31,170
audio you should provide a transcript

00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:34,380
one resource that I've found really

00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:36,360
helpful is Rev comm you can upload an

00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:38,190
audio or video file and then it charges

00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:39,480
you $1 per minute and usually within one

00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:40,710
business day they'll send you back the

00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:42,360
transcript and then you can just give it

00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:45,720
a quick proofread and upload it to your

00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:47,010
piece of content and then for your video

00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:49,820
make sure that you're providing captions

00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:53,150
and video descriptions in action our

00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:55,800
second tip is to write proper alt text

00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:57,840
alt text is a brief text description

00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,940
that can be attributed to the HTML tag

00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,740
for an image on a web page including

00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:03,300
that alt text enables users who can't

00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:05,970
see the images on a page to better

00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:08,520
understand your content it also provides

00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:10,650
that meaning to screen readers and other

00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:12,540
assistive technology so when you're

00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:15,120
writing alt text be as descriptive and

00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:16,920
accurate as possible provide context

00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,290
especially if your image is serving a

00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:20,220
specific function people who don't see

00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:23,190
the image should have the same

00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:25,200
understanding as if they had and then if

00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:27,060
you're sharing a chart or other piece of

00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:28,470
data make sure to include that data in

00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:29,580
the alt text so people have all the

00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:32,580
important information

00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:34,470
avoid using phrases like image of or

00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:36,570
picture of it's already assumed that

00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:38,070
the alt text is referencing an image and

00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:40,290
you're losing precious character space

00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:43,050
most screen readers cut off alt text at

00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:45,590
around 125 characters the caveat to this

00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:48,660
is if you're referencing a piece of art

00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:51,510
or an illustration and then no spamming

00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:53,250
keyword stuffing so alt text does help

00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:54,780
with SEO but that isn't its primary

00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:56,850
purpose so don't abuse it find that

00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:58,680
happy medium between providing all the

00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:59,880
context someone needs and also maybe one

00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:02,940
or two of those keywords that you're

00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:07,350
trying to target so Nelson how would you

00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:09,840
write alt text for this image great you

00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:11,490
might say red car in the sky but an even

00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:13,590
better version of alt text for this

00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:14,880
would be illustration a red car with

00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:16,560
flames shooting out of the back flying

00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:19,310
over a line of cars on a sunny roadway

00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:21,810
you want to provide that extra context

00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:24,270
our third tip is to establish a

00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:26,250
hierarchy so far we've given you a

00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:27,930
couple of examples relating to the text

00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:29,430
on your site but accessibility is more

00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:31,470
than just making everything on a page

00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:33,180
available as text it also affects the

00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:35,280
way you structure your content and how

00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:37,110
you guide users through a page so when

00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:38,940
you're drafting content put the most

00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:41,250
important information first groups

00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:42,840
similar content and organize different

00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:44,040
topics with headings you want to make

00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:46,520
sure your ideas are organized in a

00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:49,170
logical way to improve scan ability and

00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:51,540
then use structural elements to support

00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:53,250
that hierarchy users should be able to

00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:55,620
quickly assess what information is on a

00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:58,440
page and how its organized by using

00:09:55,620 --> 00:10:00,210
headings subheadings lists sections and

00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:01,860
other structural elements it helps

00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:03,660
establish that hierarchy and makes web

00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:05,880
pages easily understandable by humans

00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:07,440
and screen readers so a quick little

00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:09,300
story for you whenever Palantir

00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,860
relaunched a web our website a couple

00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:13,110
years ago with a new theme I was

00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:15,600
publishing a blog post and I decided

00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:16,770
that the h2 styling was really big and I

00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,320
just didn't like how it looked so I

00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:21,180
opted to use the h3 instead because I

00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,800
had this personal preference I used this

00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:24,660
in this one blog post I used it in key

00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,760
studies event listings all over our

00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:28,830
website it was a real accessibility

00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:30,240
blunder on my part and once I realized

00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:31,740
what I had done it took me a whole

00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,360
entire afternoon to go back and fix

00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:35,070
things but then it also might have been

00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:38,310
really hard for users to navigate those

00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:40,230
pages during that time here's an example

00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:42,450
of a tool you can use to catch mistakes

00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:44,310
like mine it's called wave and all you

00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:45,840
have to do is enter in a URL and it pops

00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:47,040
out this handy little sidebar where

00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:49,930
it'll flag any excess

00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:53,170
so you can see it shows that I skipped a

00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:55,210
heading level here's that same page when

00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:56,800
the headings are fixed but you can see

00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:58,030
that wave will also show you an outline

00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,800
of the structural elements that you've

00:10:58,030 --> 00:11:01,150
used so you can better visualize how

00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,650
someone who might be using assistive

00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:05,020
technologies is navigating through your

00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:07,360
page the main point here is that your

00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:09,430
page title should always be your h1 and

00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,900
heading levels should never be skipped

00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:13,540
for your personal styling preferences

00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:16,930
and then our fifth tip is to write a

00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:18,640
descriptive title for every page this

00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:19,870
one's pretty straightforward users

00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:22,270
should be able to quickly assess the

00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:23,980
information and purpose of each page and

00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:25,330
screen readers announce the page title

00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:27,130
when they load a page so writing a

00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:33,510
descriptive title helps those users make

00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:36,430
more informed page selections thank you

00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:39,100
tip number six is to be intentional with

00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:41,050
your link text so when you're sitting

00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:42,790
down to write linked text you want to

00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:45,580
think about how you can make each links

00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:47,890
purpose really clear and and obvious to

00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:49,660
the user you want links to provide info

00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:51,850
on where that the user will end up if

00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:53,950
they actually click on the link and it's

00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:57,220
2019 so I really hope no one is still

00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:58,840
using click here as their link text make

00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:01,060
sure that you're providing context about

00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:02,890
your links before instead of after the

00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:03,910
links so that if somebody is using a

00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:05,440
screen reader and they're actually

00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:07,030
reading through a page and they're

00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,320
skipping to that link by the time that

00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:09,850
that screen reader hits that link

00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,110
they'll be feel comfortable knowing

00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:13,840
where it is that they're actually about

00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:17,320
to go if they click on it don't be lazy

00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:20,200
and put URLs as link text I capture we

00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:22,510
can all imagine the the hellish nature

00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:26,140
of having a screen reader read 100

00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:29,080
unique characters it looks like it's an

00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:30,940
auctioneer avoid writing long paragraphs

00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:32,890
with multiple links peppered in

00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:35,470
throughout if you have multiple links to

00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:36,760
share on a topic instead try to group

00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:40,930
them all at the end in a bulleted list

00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:42,670
and keep your paragraph on its own so

00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:44,920
this is an example of the right way and

00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:46,510
the wrong way to write your link text so

00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:48,760
obviously want to learn more click here

00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:50,140
is is a no go and learn more about

00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:52,650
accessibility does what we're trying to

00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:56,260
achieve by explaining some context there

00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:58,330
number seven is to avoid images of text

00:12:56,260 --> 00:13:00,320
in place of actual texts and you'd be

00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:03,500
surprised how often is actually

00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:05,240
so the guideline here is by the w3 is to

00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:07,460
make it easier for users to see and hear

00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:09,710
content including separating foreground

00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:11,420
from the background so there are

00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:12,560
exceptions as for everything there

00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:14,330
exceptions to this rule if you have a

00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:16,370
logo or something like that has text on

00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:18,440
it that's that should be fine but in

00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:20,180
most cases we want to separate the to

00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:22,450
make the text selectable and highlight

00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:24,320
able and detectable by a screen reader

00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:26,240
there are actually other reasons that

00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,560
this is good and should be intuitive for

00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:30,230
people in addition to the fact that it's

00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:32,540
an accessibility thing for example SEO

00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:35,300
benefits the fact that if you're doing a

00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:37,070
find on a page with a command F or

00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:39,830
something like that as a user you can

00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:41,810
find it and then obviously selectable

00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:43,850
copy paste that sort of thing editable

00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:45,440
within the CMS so this is a client that

00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:47,750
we worked on recently to do an

00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:50,210
accessibility audit for and this is that

00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:52,550
the after of kind of us helping them but

00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:54,170
they would do these hero images of their

00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:56,360
campus and they would put this white

00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:57,980
text overlay on top of it or another

00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:00,400
color and there's a couple of reasons

00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:02,450
that this is is an accessibility blunder

00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:04,160
partly what I talked about where we're

00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:05,990
you know we want to keep that text

00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:09,470
highlight able and separated but also

00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:10,880
the contrast was varying depending on

00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:12,560
what the background image was so right

00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,780
you want to actually have what we'd

00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:16,280
instituted was this kind of

00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:18,110
semi-transparent green background so

00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:20,980
that we're maintaining that contrast

00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:23,090
ratio across everything and also that's

00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:25,280
editable within the CMS that you can

00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:28,330
change that apply to NDSU thing to

00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:31,250
whatever you feel like it it should be

00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:33,500
all right number eight is avoid idioms

00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:36,080
jargon abbreviations and other non

00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:38,750
literal words or as I like to say of you

00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:40,910
know know blah blah blah just get right

00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:42,740
to the content this is important for us

00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:44,840
as marketers in the Drupal world because

00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:46,970
it's easy to include a bunch of jargon

00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:49,430
that your client audience might not be

00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:50,810
familiar with you know I think when when

00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:52,970
you're writing it's a good rule of thumb

00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:55,280
sort of ask yourself would my friend or

00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:56,480
a family member know what it is that I'm

00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:57,890
talking about even if they don't fully

00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,930
understand the subject would they use

00:14:57,890 --> 00:15:01,520
that kind of language and if you think

00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:03,320
about it this way when people are

00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:04,190
searching obviously on a search engine

00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:06,560
or something like that

00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:07,970
they're going to be searching in their

00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:10,280
natural language so they're not going to

00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:12,030
use your super technical industry

00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:13,760
abbreviations that you

00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:16,440
I think you're super smart for including

00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:18,120
so be accessible and client friendly and

00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:21,090
if you have to use those jargon or

00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:24,120
abbreviations which sometimes we do try

00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:25,860
to provide a definition link to that

00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:27,690
definition somewhere or include an

00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:31,020
explanation of any abbreviations the

00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:33,600
first time that you're using them number

00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:35,640
nine is to create clear content for your

00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,530
audience's reading level so don't leave

00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:40,110
them looking like this poor woman and

00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:42,720
asking what's going on this means

00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:44,970
writing to a lower secondary education

00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:46,860
level actually so even if you're

00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:48,720
marketing to a group of savvy technical

00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:51,750
individuals as many of us may be in the

00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:54,900
room are you know we want our

00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:57,390
individuals to be reading this material

00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:58,830
in a way that is easy for them big words

00:15:57,390 --> 00:16:00,930
are stressful and a lot of us are

00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:04,350
reading quickly and while we're busy

00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:05,580
maybe we're at a conference and so we

00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:06,990
want to make sure that we're not over

00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:08,640
complicating things from an

00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:11,010
accessibility standpoint this affects

00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:13,130
folks with cognitive disabilities or

00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:16,020
reading disabilities like like dyslexia

00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:17,430
and if you need to include technical or

00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:19,710
complicated material to get your point

00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:21,270
across once again provide some sort of

00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:23,010
supplemental content like an infographic

00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:25,710
or an illustration or something like

00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:27,780
that to kind of show the key points

00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:29,460
there are a number of online tools that

00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:31,320
you can use to determine the readability

00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:33,630
of your content actually so something

00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:35,490
like web aim has a really great way of

00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:37,170
kind of giving you guidelines on how to

00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:38,310
write clearly and we're gonna link some

00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:39,570
of these sources for you all at the end

00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:41,430
so you don't have to take copious notes

00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:45,030
on what I just said if you're interested

00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:47,670
in checking that out last but not least

00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:50,400
of our tips is number 10 clearly label

00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:52,560
your form input elements so as as

00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:54,210
marketers forms are our best friends and

00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:57,300
I'm sure many of you have written forms

00:16:54,210 --> 00:16:58,530
before I really like this illustration

00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:00,660
and this gif because it kind of shows

00:16:58,530 --> 00:17:02,070
not only do you want to really clearly

00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:03,690
label those elements but you want to

00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:04,860
show kind of an indication of exactly

00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:06,900
what you're looking for I love those

00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:08,819
icons of like the plane landing in the

00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:10,380
plane taking off it's just very visual

00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:12,720
and very intuitive and it works well

00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:13,920
with people of kind of all types of

00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,949
disabilities from an accessibility

00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:20,459
standpoint mark your required fields

00:17:16,949 --> 00:17:21,900
that should be pretty obvious and as a

00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:23,459
bonus it's just going to be better data

00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:24,449
for you as a marketer if you're

00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:27,779
you're being really clear and obvious

00:17:24,449 --> 00:17:30,059
with your formfields okay so this is a

00:17:27,779 --> 00:17:31,440
recap of those 10 tips I will pause if

00:17:30,059 --> 00:17:33,750
people would like to take a photo of

00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,220
this but again we are going to be

00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:36,690
sharing all this stuff kind of at the

00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:39,630
end for you guys we're gonna publish a

00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:42,090
blog post so you feel free to take

00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:46,020
photos now but also you know what will

00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:47,220
make sure you have access to this I see

00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:51,059
some cameras still clicking all right

00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:53,220
I'm gonna move on so since it's

00:17:51,059 --> 00:17:54,779
DrupalCon I wanted to touch on just a

00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:56,340
couple of things that Drupal

00:17:54,779 --> 00:17:59,279
specifically does to support

00:17:56,340 --> 00:18:02,190
accessibility there are a few features

00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:03,600
that actually enable visitors to skip

00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:05,039
around with something like a screen

00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,929
reader or if they're tabbing through on

00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:08,490
their keyboard to find the information

00:18:06,929 --> 00:18:10,350
that they're looking for a little bit

00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:12,390
more easily so some of those things are

00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:14,520
there's a tabbing manager that's built

00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:16,230
into Drupal 8 which is essentially

00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:18,720
allows you to keep the focus of what

00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:20,880
somebody's tabbing through or set the

00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:22,980
order of what that is so for example on

00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,480
a forum if somebody is tabbing through

00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:26,490
that forum you can make that tabbing

00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,870
manager lead that person correctly

00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:29,460
through the forum as opposed to sort of

00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:32,460
bopping around all over the place on the

00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:34,620
page and getting lost Drupal 8 also

00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:37,169
provides a framework for audio or aural

00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:39,450
alerts which is basically when a screen

00:18:37,169 --> 00:18:41,279
reader is focused on a webpage and

00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:43,529
something dynamically changes on that

00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:44,909
webpage that isn't within the focus of

00:18:43,529 --> 00:18:47,399
the screen reader like we saw in that

00:18:44,909 --> 00:18:49,169
example it still gives the the person

00:18:47,399 --> 00:18:50,820
that's using it and alert saying hey

00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:51,870
heads-up something actually just changed

00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:53,309
on this page and you should pay

00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:55,110
attention to that which is pretty great

00:18:53,309 --> 00:18:57,539
and then there are these things called

00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:59,130
Aria landmarks that split the page out

00:18:57,539 --> 00:19:00,630
into chunks so that it can be skipped

00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:02,850
over more easily so here's kind of an

00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:04,830
illustration of how that works it's sort

00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:07,190
of like semantic markup where you can

00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:09,750
put different sections and and sort of

00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:11,970
boxes around these things but it's a

00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:13,440
little bit more built for accessibility

00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:14,850
specifically it's so that a screen

00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,010
reader can pick it up and read it and

00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:19,559
it's kind of ahead of the game as far as

00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:21,090
allowing folks to use this from an

00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:24,179
accessibility standpoint so you can kind

00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:26,309
of see the containers here you should

00:19:24,179 --> 00:19:28,860
still use semantic markup it supplements

00:19:26,309 --> 00:19:32,179
it essentially it's kind of like a an

00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:34,679
attribute that you put on your HTML tags

00:19:32,179 --> 00:19:36,539
so then I wanted to also mention

00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:37,049
specifically for content editors there

00:19:36,539 --> 00:19:38,789
are some

00:19:37,049 --> 00:19:40,980
that I like to call guardrails that

00:19:38,789 --> 00:19:42,239
Drupal kind of allows and adds some of

00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:44,429
these are out of the box and some of

00:19:42,239 --> 00:19:46,289
them you have to configure but a few

00:19:44,429 --> 00:19:48,389
things out of box is that alt text is

00:19:46,289 --> 00:19:50,309
required by default for images which

00:19:48,389 --> 00:19:52,559
means at least you won't forget to add

00:19:50,309 --> 00:19:54,929
alt text you might still make a blunder

00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:56,279
on how you do your alt text so make sure

00:19:54,929 --> 00:19:57,809
you're following the tip that we gave

00:19:56,279 --> 00:20:02,220
you about how to actually put the alt

00:19:57,809 --> 00:20:05,369
text in correctly then also Drupal 8

00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:06,809
output semantic html5 markup which you

00:20:05,369 --> 00:20:08,610
know kind of does the same thing as the

00:20:06,809 --> 00:20:09,899
Aria thing from the perspective of a

00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:12,389
screen reader and kind of moving around

00:20:09,899 --> 00:20:15,359
and as a bonus it's good for SEO and

00:20:12,389 --> 00:20:18,149
then from a configuration standpoint you

00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:19,859
can use the workbench module to create

00:20:18,149 --> 00:20:21,330
like a publishing workflow so if you're

00:20:19,859 --> 00:20:23,519
a larger organization maybe you have a

00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:25,470
junior content editor that's putting in

00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:27,029
stuff and making some accessibility

00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:29,190
blunders and maybe you've got someone

00:20:27,029 --> 00:20:30,749
that maybe it's you at your organization

00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:33,149
who is learning more about accessibility

00:20:30,749 --> 00:20:34,529
and has some of the understanding of how

00:20:33,149 --> 00:20:36,539
to to make those things better and

00:20:34,529 --> 00:20:38,489
improve on them and so before that stuff

00:20:36,539 --> 00:20:40,859
goes live that would be sent to you as a

00:20:38,489 --> 00:20:46,590
draft that you could approve or make

00:20:40,859 --> 00:20:47,999
changes to so you have all these tips

00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:51,269
now and you're probably wondering where

00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:52,559
do you start we recommend starting by

00:20:51,269 --> 00:20:54,509
assessing where your site currently

00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:55,859
stands so there are a handful of tools

00:20:54,509 --> 00:20:57,929
out there you can use to measure your

00:20:55,859 --> 00:20:59,399
site's current level of accessibility we

00:20:57,929 --> 00:21:01,379
recommend the site improve which has a

00:20:59,399 --> 00:21:03,749
free google chrome plugin and then a

00:21:01,379 --> 00:21:05,759
more extensive paid option as well we

00:21:03,749 --> 00:21:07,529
use site improve at Palantir to scan our

00:21:05,759 --> 00:21:09,600
site on a regular basis and it Flags

00:21:07,529 --> 00:21:11,669
things for us relating to the wicked

00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:13,289
standards as well as broken links

00:21:11,669 --> 00:21:15,779
missing alt text or other editorial

00:21:13,289 --> 00:21:18,359
issues and then create an editorial

00:21:15,779 --> 00:21:21,419
style guide this is especially important

00:21:18,359 --> 00:21:22,769
if you have multiple content authors it

00:21:21,419 --> 00:21:25,379
might include your own tips on writing

00:21:22,769 --> 00:21:26,820
alt text or special use cases for your

00:21:25,379 --> 00:21:29,279
company but it just makes sure that

00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:30,570
you're able to communicate how content

00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:32,279
should be published in a consistent

00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:34,169
manner to all those different content

00:21:32,279 --> 00:21:35,850
authors and then begin with incremental

00:21:34,169 --> 00:21:37,259
improvements once you have a good idea

00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:38,789
of what needs to be fixed you can kind

00:21:37,259 --> 00:21:40,200
of gather the human resources needed to

00:21:38,789 --> 00:21:43,379
make those changes and divide and

00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:45,149
conquer as a team I'm sure we all wish

00:21:43,379 --> 00:21:46,740
there was a magic moment where we could

00:21:45,149 --> 00:21:48,149
be hands-off on a site and know that

00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:49,200
everything we've ever published over

00:21:48,149 --> 00:21:50,389
time is completely

00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,289
accessible but the truth is

00:21:50,389 --> 00:21:54,000
accessibility requires constant

00:21:52,289 --> 00:21:55,440
monitoring and awareness so the best

00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,240
thing you can do is establish a process

00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:59,330
and appoint someone responsible for

00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:02,460
championing accessibility for your users

00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:03,840

00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:05,789
resources that we use to put together

00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:07,380

00:22:05,789 --> 00:22:11,269
