Title: DrupalCon Seattle 2019: Drupal Core Auto-Update Architecture
Publication date: 2019-04-12
Playlist: Drupalcon Seattle 2019
Description: 
	This session will be an update to describe intermediate and long-terms strategies and architecture for implementing autoupdates and how far we need to get with the composer initiative to make this possible.

This is a follow-up to https://events.drupal.org/nashville2018/sessions/drupal-core-auto-update-architecture

In addition it will reflect discussions and planning that happened at the 2018 Decoupled Drupal Days, 2018 Midwest Drupal Summit, and BoFs at Drupal Europe, and will reflect possible progress made leading up to DrupalCon.
