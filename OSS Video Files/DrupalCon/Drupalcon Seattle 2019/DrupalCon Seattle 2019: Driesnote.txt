conference this year and just from what

00:02:56,650 --> 00:03:00,100
I've seen in the early part of the week

00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:03,820
I'm humbled by all the positive

00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:07,209
reactions that I've heard our community

00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:08,890
has grown in terms of personas there are

00:03:07,209 --> 00:03:10,989
the builders the developers the front

00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:13,270
end designers the UX designers everyone

00:03:10,989 --> 00:03:15,330
who is involved in building digital

00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:18,209
experiences in building Drupal itself

00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:20,320
all of you are here with us today but

00:03:18,209 --> 00:03:21,970
beyond that we've also brought in the

00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:24,220
content editors and the digital

00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:26,380
marketers who now have a dedicated track

00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:28,239
within Drupal con and we're really

00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:31,570
excited about their presence here with

00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:33,790
us at the conference this new track sold

00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:35,140
out like month and a half in advance of

00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:37,209
the conference it's been very successful

00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:38,830
and we want to bring these audience

00:03:37,209 --> 00:03:41,620
together with us for all the future

00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:43,690
Drupal cons moving forward similarly

00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:45,880
we've created dedicated space for agency

00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:48,100
leaders to network with each other to

00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:50,200
learn how the buyer has changed for

00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:51,000
Drupal installations and Drupal sites

00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,530
and

00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,750
how to help grow the Drupal business

00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:56,490
ecosystem and finally we're bringing in

00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:58,470
decision-makers and people at end-user

00:03:56,490 --> 00:04:00,600
organizations of Drupal to close the

00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:02,940
feedback loop so that we understand

00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:06,840
their needs and where Drupal needs to go

00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:09,360
to support their use cases but beyond

00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:11,580
that our community has grown in other

00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:14,730
ways our thought leaders are

00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:16,380
increasingly diverse this is a quick

00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:18,150
graph of Speaker representation at the

00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:21,540
last three North American Drupal cons

00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:25,260
the gray bar represents speakers who

00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:27,540
look like me your typical white guy NIT

00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:29,820
with a ponytail but the blue bar

00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:31,980
represents the sort of underrepresented

00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:34,140
speakers from a variety of audiences a

00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:36,780
number of across a number of axes of

00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:38,669
representation and when we first began

00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:41,480
measuring this for our speaker audience

00:04:38,669 --> 00:04:44,190
at Baltimore we had about a 33%

00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:46,020
representation of these groups in

00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:47,910
Nashville that grew to 40 percent and

00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:49,620
here in Seattle 50 percent of our

00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:54,390
speakers are from underrepresented

00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:58,620
groups it's really phenomenal it's

00:04:54,390 --> 00:05:00,330
absolutely phenomenal also at this event

00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:02,580
we doubled our grants and scholarships

00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:04,620
and speaker inclusion funds to help make

00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:06,450
this possible to help bring people who

00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:08,550
might not otherwise be able to attend

00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:10,350
the event and we're thrilled that the

00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:12,570
changes we've made have enabled us to do

00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:15,630
that the support of sponsors the support

00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:17,490
of those people buying those tickets all

00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:18,720
of this makes it possible for us to

00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:20,669
bring people who otherwise wouldn't be

00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:24,350
able to make it so thank you to all of

00:05:20,669 --> 00:05:24,350
you who've helped enable us to do that

00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:32,760
on the same vein our community itself

00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:35,580
has become becoming more diverse and

00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:37,620
inclusive I want to give a special shout

00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:39,540
out to the diversity inclusion group who

00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:41,310
have led the way pushing us to elevate

00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:43,560
the voices of underrepresented people

00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:45,510
inspiring us to expand that speaker

00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:47,100
inclusion program and who've rolled up

00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:50,190
their sleeves to do the work on

00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:53,250
drupal.org and here at Drupal con you

00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:55,200
can see some statistics anonymized

00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:57,090
demographic information from the users

00:05:55,200 --> 00:06:00,270
who've opted to give it this information

00:05:57,090 --> 00:06:03,390
to us this is about this comes from

00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:04,330
about a 13% sample of the folks who've

00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:07,300
been active in the

00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:08,860
here and these are some metrics that

00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:12,220
we're tracking and then want to continue

00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:14,259
to improve over time but that work is

00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:16,539
never finished the work of becoming a

00:06:14,259 --> 00:06:18,639
warm or welcoming community a more

00:06:16,539 --> 00:06:20,800
welcoming project whether that's for

00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:22,990
personas whether that's for people from

00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:25,930
underrepresented groups and in many

00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:29,229
different ways always continues and I

00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:30,729
was really excited last night when the

00:06:29,229 --> 00:06:32,409
Drupal diversity inclusion group

00:06:30,729 --> 00:06:34,509
announced a new initiative they're

00:06:32,409 --> 00:06:36,580
starting a speaker initiative to help

00:06:34,509 --> 00:06:38,680
further increase the number of

00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:40,599
underrepresented people who feel

00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:43,060
confident speaking submitting sessions

00:06:40,599 --> 00:06:45,400
and coming to Drupal con and other

00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:48,729
events to share their knowledge in their

00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:50,319
insights so last night at the opening

00:06:48,729 --> 00:06:53,080
reception they announced this initiative

00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:54,849
and I want to thank Pantheon who's

00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:57,669
offering to match the first donations up

00:06:54,849 --> 00:07:01,810
to $2,500 and the seed donors you see

00:06:57,669 --> 00:07:04,120
there who have chipped in already even

00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:06,190
though this just went live last night to

00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:07,719
get us started so if you'd like to get

00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:11,560
involved there are some links you can

00:07:07,719 --> 00:07:13,389
use to learn more finally I want to give

00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:15,300
a quick update sort of a governance

00:07:13,389 --> 00:07:17,620
update we've had a lot of conversations

00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:20,259
over the past couple of years about

00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:21,819
evolving drupal's governance and in this

00:07:20,259 --> 00:07:24,870
particular area I wanted to give an

00:07:21,819 --> 00:07:28,360
update about the community working group

00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:29,560
we've made a few changes in supporting

00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:32,139
that community working group they've

00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:34,599
adopted a new charter in December of

00:07:32,139 --> 00:07:36,789
last year so that they can focus their

00:07:34,599 --> 00:07:38,860
programs in new ways they there they're

00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:40,960
no longer just a conflict resolution

00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:43,779
body but they can focus proactively on

00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:46,029
community health on leadership training

00:07:43,779 --> 00:07:48,159
we can provide legal support for the

00:07:46,029 --> 00:07:50,919
community working group and they have a

00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:53,379
new independent escalation body for any

00:07:50,919 --> 00:07:56,409
of their decisions and the situations

00:07:53,379 --> 00:07:58,300
that they get into and so that

00:07:56,409 --> 00:08:00,190
escalation body that the community

00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:02,379
working group can rely on is made up of

00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:03,789
the community elected positions of the

00:08:02,379 --> 00:08:06,099
Drupal Association board

00:08:03,789 --> 00:08:08,349
so that's currently Suzanne and Ryan and

00:08:06,099 --> 00:08:11,169
we've brought in a third party outside

00:08:08,349 --> 00:08:13,120
member to give up give us a perspective

00:08:11,169 --> 00:08:14,649
beyond just the Drupal community so

00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,350
that's Jono Bacon who will be joining

00:08:14,649 --> 00:08:23,240
that review

00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:25,180
maybe now I'd like to give you some

00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:28,700
updates on Drupal Association programs

00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:31,010
so first last year we talked a lot about

00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:33,410
the promote Drupal initiative this was

00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:35,270
sort of a one-time fund raised

00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:38,150
initiative to create something almost

00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:41,450
like an initiative coordinator position

00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:45,470
except not for some code Sprint's but

00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:47,750
for promotional materials to create a

00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:49,880
consistent Drupal brand and strategic

00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:52,520
messaging and to connect new decision

00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:55,780
makers and influencers throughout the

00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:58,370
world this has been a global partnership

00:08:55,780 --> 00:09:02,020
the same way that we work or collaborate

00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:05,510
on code on documentation on UX on events

00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:07,520
it's an effort that spans the globe and

00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:09,200
I want to thank in particular many

00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:11,630
members of the European community who

00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,980
have led the way in the promote Drupal

00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:14,630
initiative and put together a lot of

00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:16,400
materials and I want to share a quick

00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:19,220
sneak preview of some of these materials

00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:23,090
that are being made available so this

00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:24,950
started off with a brand book for drupal

00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:26,570
so that any materials that we're going

00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:28,030
to be created as part of the initiative

00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:33,110
would have this consistent look and feel

00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:34,310
so it's an extremely long document so

00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:36,230
I'm just gonna let it scroll through

00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:39,470
here but it has all the guidelines the

00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:41,300
color the logo usage tone of voice all

00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:43,190
of these things that help us make sure

00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:44,780
that all the materials created by this

00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:48,740
group are going to be used in a

00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:50,420
consistent way there was also a pitch

00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:52,370
deck that was put together as part of

00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:54,590
this effort that can be used

00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:57,410
collaboratively by any freelancer any

00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:59,390
agency any individual who's trying to

00:09:57,410 --> 00:10:02,690
demonstrate the power of Drupal trying

00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:05,600
to show what tremendous sites what case

00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:07,580
studies are out there again it's just

00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,290
such a tremendous resource but also

00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:11,510
tremendously long so I'm flipping

00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:13,220
through it very very quickly here but

00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:15,350
there's some amazing stories there that

00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:17,960
when anyone in this room is having a

00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:19,400
conversation about Drupal and the power

00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:22,610
of Drupal and where it's used in the

00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:24,830
real world this can help you to show

00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:26,690
that to your prospective clients or

00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:29,080
whoever you're trying to educate about

00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:30,520
what we do

00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:32,230
if you want to participate in this by

00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:34,870
the way you can submit a case study to

00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:36,430
be included in this slide deck and you

00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:42,130
can get involved in the promote Drupal

00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:43,930
initiative in addition to that another

00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:45,880
effort underway is a new case study

00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:48,790
format this isn't live yet so I'm just

00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:51,850
going to share a design mock but we are

00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:53,590
intending to create a new version of the

00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:55,840
way the case study format on drupal.org

00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:58,690
works that's more media centric more

00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:59,950
interactive with more testimonials and

00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:02,290
statistics something that's better

00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:04,330
targeted to the end user audience rather

00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:06,040
than just a sort of technical overview

00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:09,490
although those details will be included

00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:11,230
as well finally at the beginning of this

00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:13,060
presentation you all saw that fantastic

00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:16,120
video that was put together as part of

00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:17,830
this initiative so that video is being

00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:19,870
licensed under Creative Commons and

00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:22,510
again being made available to anyone

00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:25,030
around the world individual agency

00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:29,370
anyone who would like to promote Drupal

00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:31,420
on any channel they have to any audience

00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:33,190
and I want to say some thank yous

00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:35,650
because the promote Drupal initiative is

00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:38,230
not possible without the support of many

00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:40,330
individuals and organizations in

00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:42,160
particular I'd like to thank the top

00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:44,680
contributors who helped build some of

00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:46,300
these materials first both individuals

00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:47,800
and organizations who did a lot of work

00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:50,200
to make those materials that I just

00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:53,200
showed you possible but I'd also like to

00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:55,570
to thank the sponsors of this phase one

00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:57,100
of the promote Drupal program a lot of

00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:58,839
people came together when we put out a

00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:01,839
call for fundraising to make it possible

00:11:58,839 --> 00:12:04,170
for us to do this work so thank you very

00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:04,170
much

00:12:09,379 --> 00:12:13,529
so next I'd like to talk about some

00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:14,910
updates from the some more updates from

00:12:13,529 --> 00:12:17,190
the association in particular around

00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:19,379
drupal.org tooling I think something

00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:22,129
might have happened involving a new

00:12:19,379 --> 00:12:24,600
virtual assistant on April 1st

00:12:22,129 --> 00:12:29,240
everybody out that was that was really

00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:31,470
the big one really exciting but actually

00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:33,360
the main thing I'd like to talk about is

00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:35,339
our partnership with git lab and the

00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:39,029
tooling upgrade that just happened in

00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:44,639
the last two weeks on drupal.org thank

00:12:39,029 --> 00:12:46,139
you so this has been a multi-year multi

00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:48,149
working group a multi committee

00:12:46,139 --> 00:12:49,980
initiative and we finally made a

00:12:48,149 --> 00:12:51,629
decision to move forward with a partner

00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:54,029
in this case get lab and we've completed

00:12:51,629 --> 00:12:56,339
that first phase of that work which

00:12:54,029 --> 00:12:58,199
means that all of those code viewing

00:12:56,339 --> 00:12:59,910
links anywhere on drupal.org and old

00:12:58,199 --> 00:13:01,589
issues and new issues in the sidebar of

00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:03,959
projects all that stuff will now take

00:13:01,589 --> 00:13:07,019
you to be beautiful and much more usable

00:13:03,959 --> 00:13:09,269
code viewing interface in git lab if

00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:11,610
you're a maintainer of a project you can

00:13:09,269 --> 00:13:15,839
already use inline editing tools within

00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:17,550
that interface and coming next will

00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:19,709
begin an incremental rollout of

00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:23,040
additional features and that means merge

00:13:19,709 --> 00:13:24,870
requests are not too far away so we're

00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,699
really excited about this really excited

00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:29,670
about these changes we're still working

00:13:26,699 --> 00:13:30,990
together with the gate lab team to make

00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:32,970
this happen in fact they're gonna be

00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:34,529
here this week there's a panel on

00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:36,209
Thursday morning if you have questions

00:13:34,529 --> 00:13:38,519
about this process or just want to hear

00:13:36,209 --> 00:13:41,370
about the journey so we're thrilled with

00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:43,560
this and thrilled to keep improving and

00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:46,560
involving the tooling that the Drupal

00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:48,149
community uses finally I want to talk a

00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,259
little bit about Drupal Stewart which is

00:13:48,149 --> 00:13:52,500
a new program and we hope to be

00:13:49,259 --> 00:13:55,410
introducing soon Drupal Stewart is born

00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:57,779
out of the idea that having to have your

00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:59,579
team's on red alert for a patch release

00:13:57,779 --> 00:14:02,639
for a highly critical security release

00:13:59,579 --> 00:14:04,410
can be difficult frustrating especially

00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:05,970
if you're a large enterprise especially

00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:08,459
if you're not in the United States in

00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:10,350
these time zones and so we work together

00:14:08,459 --> 00:14:12,089
with the security team to create a sort

00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:14,759
of joint service that we're developing

00:14:12,089 --> 00:14:16,800
to roll out so this joint service is to

00:14:14,759 --> 00:14:18,029
create a web application firewall that

00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,860
will help protect sites from

00:14:18,029 --> 00:14:20,300
vulnerabilities ahead of the patch

00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:22,610
really

00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:24,680
and we'll use those proceeds to support

00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:26,690
security team programs support support

00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:29,690
Association programs so there's going to

00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:31,070
be a Boff later today that I encourage

00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:34,400
you to join to learn more about how this

00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:37,360
is going to work and now a few

00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:39,590
thank-yous and by a few I mean many

00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:42,320
first a tremendous thank you to the

00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:44,450
Drupal Association staff without the

00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,610
help of the staff none of this would

00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:49,190
have happened and we are a small group

00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:51,080
of people it's everyone boots on the

00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:54,200
ground everyone contributing in every

00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:56,360
way so this is your staff of the

00:14:54,200 --> 00:15:00,860
association if you see them say thank

00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:02,960
you I also want to say thank you to our

00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:04,730
production partners these are the people

00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:07,730
behind the scenes who set up the stage

00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:09,710
who organized the a/v who've consulted

00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:12,140
with us on other parts of expanding the

00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:13,730
event they're great folks if you run

00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:16,940
your own events consider reaching out to

00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:19,340
them finally I want to thank well not

00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:21,380
even finally I want to continue to thank

00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:25,270
our sponsors including our diamond

00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:29,810
sponsors Acquia Pantheon and platform SH

00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:32,740
all of our platinum sponsors our Gold

00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:36,410
level sponsors Silver level sponsors

00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:38,360
bronze and module sponsors who sponsor

00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:40,160
things like the special events like

00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:43,130
coffee or the women in Drupal lunch and

00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:44,540
things like that I want to thank our

00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:46,070
supporting partners as well the

00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:48,050
supporting partner program is what funds

00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:49,700
the work on drupal.org so for example

00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:52,370
this transition to get lab would not be

00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:53,980
possible if we did not have supporting

00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:56,540
partners to fund the engineering team

00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:58,340
similarly all of the testing the Drupal

00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:59,690
CI infrastructure we simply couldn't

00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:01,670
afford it without the help of these

00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:03,290
supporting partners so I want to thank

00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:06,320
our signature supporting partners our

00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:07,940
Premium supporting partners and the

00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:12,320
classic supporting partners in our

00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:14,180
partner program finally a special thanks

00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,680
to top individual contributors to the

00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:18,020
project so as you know we started

00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:21,500
tracking a contribution credit system

00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:25,910
and in no particular order here are all

00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:28,790
the top 75 I believe contributors over

00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:30,410
the last year in terms of contribution

00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:32,240
credits yes a round of applause for

00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:33,220
these people who have moved Drupal

00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:39,260
forward

00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:40,579
absolutely in addition there are a

00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:42,500
number of organizations that sponsor

00:16:40,579 --> 00:16:44,450
this work and I want to recognize the

00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:46,610
top organizations that do that as well

00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:49,459
so these are the top organizational

00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:52,279
contributors those who have sponsored

00:16:49,459 --> 00:16:54,380
the most individual work that made it

00:16:52,279 --> 00:17:00,040
into the Drupal project so thank you

00:16:54,380 --> 00:17:02,600
very much to all of these people and

00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:04,400
finally Thank You volunteers there are

00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:06,290
so many of you here in the audience and

00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,490
so many more who can't be in this room

00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:09,559
because they're around the Convention

00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:11,630

right some quick housekeeping and

00:17:20,059 --> 00:17:24,380
updates before we get into the rest of

00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:26,419
our programming one the code of conduct

00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:27,740
is critically important and I wanted to

00:17:26,419 --> 00:17:30,260
talk about this pretty much at the top

00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:32,000
of my housekeeping session DrupalCon is

00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:34,850

00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:42,140
ever need to immediately make a call

00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:45,260
about a concern you might have you can

00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:47,030

00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:54,140
should occur please let these people

00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:55,460
know the Wi-Fi yeah it doesn't beat the

00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:56,150
code of conduct but in case you don't

multiple people nominated Leslie fir or

00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:27,049
for this award this year one of them

00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:29,240
wrote and I'm quoting if you have ever

00:23:27,049 --> 00:23:32,539
attended a North American Drupal con bat

00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:34,730
camp nice camp an ED camp designed for

00:23:32,539 --> 00:23:36,980
Drupal or any other major North American

00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:39,500
Drupal event then you have seen Leslie

00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:42,110
she's a constant inspiration of how our

00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:45,470
community and each one of us should work

00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:48,620
and out another one of her nominators

00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:51,260
wrote Leslie is a dependable passionate

00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:53,270
kind and giving individual and the

00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:56,179
Drupal community is extremely fortunate

00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:59,419
to have her I've been lucky enough to

00:23:56,179 --> 00:24:01,280
know Leslie the majority of my time that

00:23:59,419 --> 00:24:03,500
I've been in the Drupal community and

00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:05,929
I'm honestly hard-pressed to think of an

00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:08,450
event where I've seen Leslie where she

00:24:05,929 --> 00:24:11,210
isn't volunteering in some form or

00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:13,520
fashion she sets a great example for all

00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:16,789
of us that volunteering just a little

00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:18,230
bit can make a huge difference so it's

00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:21,140
for this reason that we are proud to

00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:23,980
present Leslie with the 2019 Erin

00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:23,980

ever think that I'd be standing up here

00:24:43,909 --> 00:24:47,990
receiving this great honor it would be

00:24:46,549 --> 00:24:49,970
much more comfortable standing at the

00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:53,630

word I was lucky enough to be at Rubicon

I mean I'm sorry at nice camp at the UN

00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:21,980
in 2013 when Aaron wind-borne was able

00:25:18,679 --> 00:25:24,200
to give the keynote speech Aaron was in

00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:28,130
a wheelchair he was used in assistive

00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:29,780
technology but he still spoke to it

00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:31,520
spoke to the audience told them about

00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:33,799
the media module how proud he was of all

00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:35,059
the volunteers that helped and out.we

00:25:33,799 --> 00:25:36,710
proud of all the volunteers that have

00:25:35,059 --> 00:25:38,240

00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:44,750
with that also Aaron spoke about he was

00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:47,330
in a wheelchair he was using assistive

00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:48,919
technology but he spoke about how he

00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:51,080
wasn't able to work anymore and how

00:25:48,919 --> 00:25:52,760
disappointed he was and that but how he

00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:54,799
was still going to stay in the issue

00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:57,049
queue and continue contributing back to

00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:59,150
the Drupal community and that was very

00:25:57,049 --> 00:26:00,350
inspirational for me and for a lot of

00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:03,820
other people that were fortunate enough

00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:06,830
to hear him speak that year so

00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:10,280

everyone had a good time

00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:47,809

players we have in the crowd so

00:27:47,809 --> 00:27:52,130
congratulations to the ping-pong

00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:54,260
ping-pong winners so I am NOT a

00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:56,720
developer but I am a marketer and I've

00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:59,450
spent a long time marketing Drupal in

00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:01,370
Acquia and at aqua I've had a great

00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:04,279
opportunity to work with so many

00:28:01,370 --> 00:28:06,470
different organizations large ones small

00:28:04,279 --> 00:28:08,029
ones all different industries who have

00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:10,490
really seen their businesses change

00:28:08,029 --> 00:28:13,429
based on Drupal and really have great

00:28:10,490 --> 00:28:16,970
business impact from using Drupal my

00:28:13,429 --> 00:28:18,980
personal favorite I want to share is an

00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:21,529
application that's been doing some great

00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:23,570
work from the folks back home for me at

00:28:21,529 --> 00:28:25,039
Boston Children's Hospital they have a

00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:27,409
drupal application called open

00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:29,480
pediatrics and i can personally say that

00:28:27,409 --> 00:28:32,630
this particular drupal application is a

00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:35,390
training vehicle for doctors for nurses

00:28:32,630 --> 00:28:37,820
for researchers and for caregivers and

00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:39,860
around the world i know that it has

00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:42,559
saved at a minimum hundreds of

00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:44,960
children's lives so for me it's a great

00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:47,649
opportunity to say thank you to you for

00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,649

that's happening on that so I have the

00:30:56,390 --> 00:31:01,309
great pleasure of introducing Driss for

00:30:59,419 --> 00:31:02,899
the Driss note this morning we all know

00:31:01,309 --> 00:31:05,149
he's belgian-born he's the founder of

00:31:02,899 --> 00:31:07,309
Drupal the pioneer of open source IND

00:31:05,149 --> 00:31:09,169
reese's keynote this morning he has some

00:31:07,309 --> 00:31:11,419
great announcements that he'll be making

00:31:09,169 --> 00:31:13,580
he'll talk a lot about the road to

00:31:11,419 --> 00:31:15,320
Drupal 9 and one of the things that I

00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:16,909
think is equally as important the road

00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:18,620
to Drupal 9 is kind of what happens

00:31:16,909 --> 00:31:20,120
between now and then

00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:22,669
so he'll be spending some time on that

00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:24,500
and as always he'll update beyond the

00:31:22,669 --> 00:31:26,570
code talking about the community values

00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:29,029
and principles to life and the efforts

00:31:26,570 --> 00:31:31,039
to promote Drupal to the world so it's

00:31:29,029 --> 00:31:33,440
my distinct pleasure to be able to

00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:36,200
introduce the founder of Drupal the

00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:38,559
founder and CTO of Acquia and my friend

00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,559
Treece

00:31:38,610 --> 00:31:42,670
[Applause]

00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:51,900
good morning everybody

00:31:48,410 --> 00:31:54,360
yeah Leslie congratulations on your

00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:57,360
award I was actually crying as I was

00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:59,880
listening to your story and still

00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:01,250
emotional about it apparently sorry

00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:06,390
about that

00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:07,770
Tim Lennon actually talked about you

00:32:06,390 --> 00:32:09,960
know as part of his entry talked a

00:32:07,770 --> 00:32:11,550
little bit about diversity and inclusion

00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:15,450
and I wanted to talk a little bit more

00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:17,300
about that today as well and so not too

00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:21,020
long ago I actually had a conversation

00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:23,270
with the Drupal diversity and inclusion

00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:25,920
leadership team part of that team and

00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:29,970
they actually said something to me that

00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:31,650
was really profound for me you know it

00:32:29,970 --> 00:32:34,080
got me thinking and I've been thinking

00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:35,790
about it since oh it's kind of special

00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:38,310
in a way because I've been doing open

00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:40,530
source for 20 years right and so they

00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:43,980
told me something that kind of changed

00:32:40,530 --> 00:32:46,410
my mind about it open source or a part

00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:48,660
of a part of open source right and so I

00:32:46,410 --> 00:32:51,510
wanted to kick off my keynote with that

00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:55,200
topic before I get into some of the the

00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:57,660
product updates and so what they told me

00:32:55,200 --> 00:33:00,120
is that diversity in open source is

00:32:57,660 --> 00:33:01,730
actually much worse than the diversity

00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:04,470
in the technology sector

00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:07,560
I made me to some of you that isn't a

00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:10,290
huge surprise but for me it was you know

00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:11,970
kind of new and so if you look at some

00:33:10,290 --> 00:33:14,690
of the data and you can see it on the

00:33:11,970 --> 00:33:17,760
screen you know in technology generally

00:33:14,690 --> 00:33:19,920
one out of five developers aren't men

00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:23,580
but in open-source it's actually much

00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:26,460
worse you know only one in 20 identify

00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:29,370
as not male and so seeing these

00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:31,020
statistics you know obviously makes me

00:33:29,370 --> 00:33:33,200
wonder how we're doing in Drupal and we

00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:34,950
don't have good data but regardless

00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:40,260
clearly there's a lot of room for

00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:43,710
improvement in this area and so the

00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:46,740
question then is like why is it so much

00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:48,990
worse in open source you know and

00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:51,570
there's obviously a lot of different

00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:55,470
factors to this but one of the factors

00:33:51,570 --> 00:33:56,490
is the issue of time right and so there

00:33:55,470 --> 00:33:59,520
are systemic

00:33:56,490 --> 00:34:01,650
shoes that basically negatively affect

00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:05,070
underrepresented groups for example

00:34:01,650 --> 00:34:07,500
women still today often spend double the

00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:11,220
amount of time doing unpaid domestic

00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:14,550
work or you know in certain racial

00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:16,110
groups there is serious wage gaps and it

00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:18,300
affects how much these people can

00:34:16,110 --> 00:34:20,159
contribute right some of them have to

00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:22,800
work more hours some of them have to

00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:25,230
work maybe two or three jobs to provide

00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:28,980
for their families and it's preventing

00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:30,929
them from contributing as much as maybe

00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:34,230
other people can or prevent them from

00:34:30,929 --> 00:34:38,879
contributing at all and so the issue of

00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:42,810
time is you know a big issue right three

00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:47,399
time to contribute the open source is a

00:34:42,810 --> 00:34:49,350
privilege and I used to believe you know

00:34:47,399 --> 00:34:51,330
I used to say I used to write about this

00:34:49,350 --> 00:34:53,460
actually I used to say that everybody

00:34:51,330 --> 00:34:55,860
could contribute to Drupal that's the

00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:58,590
only thing that you need it was a

00:34:55,860 --> 00:35:01,170
willingness to learn and so today

00:34:58,590 --> 00:35:03,600
obviously looking at this data talking

00:35:01,170 --> 00:35:05,760
to different people about this I've come

00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:08,609
to realize that that is not true but

00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:12,690
open-source isn't actually a meritocracy

00:35:08,609 --> 00:35:16,500
because not everybody has free time and

00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:18,540
so I believe that we have an obligation

00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:21,119
to try and do something about that

00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:24,230
especially those that have time you know

00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:26,190
we can do something about this today

00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:30,510
because everybody deserves the

00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:33,270
opportunity to contribute obviously we

00:35:30,510 --> 00:35:35,940
can't change all of this overnight like

00:35:33,270 --> 00:35:39,119
we can fix years and years of systemic

00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:40,950
issues and societal issues but there are

00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:42,960
things that are in our control as

00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:45,720
individuals and there are things that

00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:49,010
are in our control as organization that

00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:51,210
we can start changing today right so

00:35:49,010 --> 00:35:52,850
before I go there let's talk a little

00:35:51,210 --> 00:35:55,350
bit about why this matters because

00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:57,690
there's a lot of reasons why diversity

00:35:55,350 --> 00:35:59,340
and inclusion are a great thing some of

00:35:57,690 --> 00:36:03,720
you may be skeptical in the room I don't

00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:07,830
know but just a few examples as you

00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:10,310
probably know Drupal is used roughly by

00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:14,130
one out of thirty web sites in the world

00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:17,340
what that means is that we serve

00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:20,190
billions of people right if you think

00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:22,410
about this notion like if you visit more

00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:24,870
than 30 websites on average you will

00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:27,270
have hit a Drupal site most people visit

00:36:24,870 --> 00:36:30,300
more than 30 web sites and so basically

00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:32,340
we almost touch everybody in the world

00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:35,400
and these people that we touch with

00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:37,560
Drupal they are very diverse and so the

00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:40,590
best way to build software for all these

00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:42,990
people is to be diverse ourselves as a

00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:44,880
community of contributors right that's

00:36:42,990 --> 00:36:48,180
the best way we can do it and for those

00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:50,010
that contribute to Drupal core you know

00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:52,470
we do have people like we have blind

00:36:50,010 --> 00:36:53,910
people contributing to Drupal core and

00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:56,400
it's been amazing because it actually

00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:58,110
helped us build better software right so

00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:01,380
think about that example and how do we

00:36:58,110 --> 00:37:03,060
apply that to everything we do and this

00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:04,980
is not just me saying this this is

00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:06,900
backed up by a lot of research Harvard

00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:10,860
did research on this all of these

00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:13,500
organizations another organization

00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:15,210
McKinsey they said that diversity

00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:18,060
improves collaboration because it

00:37:15,210 --> 00:37:21,000
actually reduces bias it reduces group

00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:25,200
think it helps organizations deal with

00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:27,060
conflict much better it's also proven

00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:29,310
that it unlocks innovation and

00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:31,860
creativity when people feel welcomed and

00:37:29,310 --> 00:37:33,780
people feel safe and comfortable they're

00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:36,240
much more willing to share ideas to

00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:38,610
propose ideas another experience that

00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:40,970
myself you know in various organizations

00:37:38,610 --> 00:37:43,590
and groups like if you feel comfortable

00:37:40,970 --> 00:37:46,710
you're much more willing to share and so

00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:48,000
these are just a few examples of why

00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:50,250
diversity and inclusion matters

00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:52,290
obviously it's not only good for our

00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:53,970
community but it's also good for all the

00:37:52,290 --> 00:37:56,400
people that we touch with this right

00:37:53,970 --> 00:38:01,080
there's many many reasons why we want to

00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:03,600
do this and so those that have time to

00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:07,530
contribute we should really try and make

00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:08,730
an offer effort to welcome other people

00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:10,890
in the community and there's a lot of

00:38:08,730 --> 00:38:13,110
different ways you can do this you can

00:38:10,890 --> 00:38:15,900
intentionally try to welcome people you

00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:19,200
can mentor people from underrepresented

00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:21,510
groups when they ask you to and you can

00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:22,870
also make space if you're in a community

00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:25,690
organizing rule

00:38:22,870 --> 00:38:28,060
or an event organizing rule you can make

00:38:25,690 --> 00:38:29,890
space to give them time to present or

00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:31,690
lead sprints these kinds of things that

00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:33,910
things that we're starting to do or have

00:38:31,690 --> 00:38:35,050
been doing now for several years with

00:38:33,910 --> 00:38:40,180
the Drupal Association

00:38:35,050 --> 00:38:41,920
a few weeks ago I was you know reading

00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:47,350
up on issues and the in the issue queue

00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:50,230
and I came across this code review from

00:38:47,350 --> 00:38:52,480
Kuno yet I think it's pronounced but

00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:55,480
what was amazing about his review was

00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:57,070
the kindness and how helpful he was and

00:38:55,480 --> 00:39:00,460
I was literally blown away by this

00:38:57,070 --> 00:39:03,970
comment and so it was a great example of

00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:06,100
how many of us can behave in the issue

00:39:03,970 --> 00:39:08,080
queue and this is really important

00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:11,770
because other research research from

00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:14,620
github has shown that one out of five

00:39:11,770 --> 00:39:16,630
people we experienced negative behavior

00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:19,930
when contributing to open source

00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:21,960
actually stopped contributing at all I'd

00:39:19,930 --> 00:39:25,600
say imagine how many people he can lose

00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:29,010
and how quickly you can lose many great

00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:31,750
contributors so this is something that

00:39:29,010 --> 00:39:35,440
you know all of us can always be aware

00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:38,440
of organizations can also do a lot of

00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:40,780
things obviously you can pay your

00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:43,120
employees to contribute so people don't

00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:44,800
have to work at night or on the weekend

00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:47,560
you can pay them full-time you can pay

00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:50,470
them part-time you can also donate to

00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:53,320
different programs that allow others to

00:39:50,470 --> 00:39:55,630
contribute so these are just some of the

00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:59,220
things that you can do as an

00:39:55,630 --> 00:40:01,540
organization of course Drupal itself

00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:04,210
doesn't sit still we're constantly

00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:06,550
looking to do more things to improve our

00:40:04,210 --> 00:40:09,520
own diversity and inclusion we've

00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:12,690
extended the commits credits to include

00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:16,240
non code contributions that's been huge

00:40:12,690 --> 00:40:19,360
we have updated the gender field on

00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:22,420
drupal.org to do not be a binary field

00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:26,260
so people can choose from more options

00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:28,390
and self-identify we keep updating and

00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:32,010
tweaking or code of conduct or terms of

00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:34,240
services we've expanded our Drupal

00:40:32,010 --> 00:40:35,830
scholarship program Tim talked a little

00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:37,840
bit about that

00:40:35,830 --> 00:40:41,820
and a steam also talked about we keep

00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:44,980
increasing the diversity of our speakers

00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:47,670
not only is half of the speakers from

00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:50,860
underrepresented groups but almost 40%

00:40:47,670 --> 00:40:53,400
are also first time speakers which is a

00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:55,930
great statistic as well obviously

00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:58,420
education and open dialogue are very

00:40:55,930 --> 00:41:01,170
important so we have a lot of sessions

00:40:58,420 --> 00:41:03,490
about this as well and you can go watch

00:41:01,170 --> 00:41:06,220
some of these sessions today these are

00:41:03,490 --> 00:41:09,340
just the sessions today about diversity

00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:12,040
and inclusion so I encourage all of you

00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:14,680
to attend those especially if you

00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:18,330
wouldn't otherwise have chosen to attend

00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:23,020
one of those sessions so with that I

00:41:18,330 --> 00:41:25,210
want to progress into sort of the next

00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:27,100
section so we have a lot of people

00:41:25,210 --> 00:41:29,980
contributing to the Drupal many of whom

00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:32,710
are here today and together we're one of

00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:34,870
the largest and most driving open source

00:41:32,710 --> 00:41:37,030
community in the way communities in the

00:41:34,870 --> 00:41:40,240
world right and so we should lead by

00:41:37,030 --> 00:41:42,550
example we have over a thousand

00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:44,770
organizations contributing to Drupal I

00:41:42,550 --> 00:41:46,570
mean it's like a it's a massive number

00:41:44,770 --> 00:41:48,220
if you think about it like how many

00:41:46,570 --> 00:41:51,070
other open-source projects have

00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:53,110
thousands of people we have companies

00:41:51,070 --> 00:41:56,770
like Pfizer who are leading a core

00:41:53,110 --> 00:41:59,140
initiative around workflows we have

00:41:56,770 --> 00:42:02,260
companies like hook 42 and they wrote

00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:04,210
the book on Drupal 7 multilingual also

00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:09,130
sponsoring they simply test up me

00:42:04,210 --> 00:42:11,800
testing infrastructure 1x internet they

00:42:09,130 --> 00:42:14,880
Co organized Drupal Europe and you know

00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:17,350
employer Drupal Association board member

00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:20,680
3rd & Grove they're sponsoring a

00:42:17,350 --> 00:42:22,780
full-time core committer drug they

00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:25,330
sponsored the creation of a new service

00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:27,100
sprint kit which is used to you know

00:42:25,330 --> 00:42:30,310
mentor and on board you know new

00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:33,070
contributors in our community Thunder

00:42:30,310 --> 00:42:35,110
was building a distribution for media

00:42:33,070 --> 00:42:37,840
websites I mean the list goes on and on

00:42:35,110 --> 00:42:40,270
and on so many great contributors there

00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:43,150
is also over 10,000 individual

00:42:40,270 --> 00:42:45,010
contributors to Drupal again you know

00:42:43,150 --> 00:42:48,250
this makes us one of the largest open

00:42:45,010 --> 00:42:49,390
source communities in the world people

00:42:48,250 --> 00:42:53,230
like asgard

00:42:49,390 --> 00:42:55,749
who are promoting Drupal in Pakistan as

00:42:53,230 --> 00:42:58,380
a way to make a living for those with

00:42:55,749 --> 00:42:59,859
limited resources it's an amazing story

00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:01,630
Fatima

00:42:59,859 --> 00:43:04,089
part of the Drupal diversity and

00:43:01,630 --> 00:43:05,799
inclusion leadership team she's also

00:43:04,089 --> 00:43:08,400
working on governance she's also

00:43:05,799 --> 00:43:11,980
contributing fixes to Drupal core

00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:15,220
contributes in many ways Narcisse was

00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:17,559
doing Drupal trainings in the Democratic

00:43:15,220 --> 00:43:19,739
Republic of Congo he's been doing that

00:43:17,559 --> 00:43:22,660
for many many years

00:43:19,739 --> 00:43:25,559
Hayes's who creates the drupal console

00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:28,420
project which is used by many

00:43:25,559 --> 00:43:30,309
poonam who has led multiple trainings

00:43:28,420 --> 00:43:33,339
and also led 50 Women in Technology

00:43:30,309 --> 00:43:35,499
trainings in India I mean these are just

00:43:33,339 --> 00:43:39,099
some amazing stories and I can keep

00:43:35,499 --> 00:43:41,410
going and going and going but together

00:43:39,099 --> 00:43:44,109
as a community of people all around the

00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:46,989
world organizations all around the world

00:43:44,109 --> 00:43:49,269
we've made some amazing progress in the

00:43:46,989 --> 00:43:51,279
last six months since my previous tree

00:43:49,269 --> 00:43:54,279
is not and so I wanna give you a quick

00:43:51,279 --> 00:43:54,989
update on all of the progress that we've

00:43:54,279 --> 00:43:59,079
made

00:43:54,989 --> 00:44:02,410
first of all Drupal 8 you know keeps on

00:43:59,079 --> 00:44:06,099
growing we have 35 percent more Drupal 8

00:44:02,410 --> 00:44:08,440
sites compared to a year ago the

00:44:06,099 --> 00:44:11,109
platform is also really stable because

00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:13,809
we have almost you know 50 percent more

00:44:11,109 --> 00:44:16,539
stable Drupal 8 modules compared to a

00:44:13,809 --> 00:44:19,150
year ago which is really fantastic news

00:44:16,539 --> 00:44:21,460
for those that are looking to migrate to

00:44:19,150 --> 00:44:23,380
Drupal 8 it may not have been able to

00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:25,089
yet because some of the modules weren't

00:44:23,380 --> 00:44:26,980
ready so more and more modules are

00:44:25,089 --> 00:44:28,710
getting ready and getting very ready

00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:32,369
very quickly

00:44:28,710 --> 00:44:35,230
we're also less than three weeks away

00:44:32,369 --> 00:44:38,619
from launching eight point seven which

00:44:35,230 --> 00:44:40,509
is gonna be a fantastic release yeah and

00:44:38,619 --> 00:44:45,789
so let's talk a little bit more about

00:44:40,509 --> 00:44:46,420
that so at Drupal Europe the previous

00:44:45,789 --> 00:44:48,730
conference

00:44:46,420 --> 00:44:51,730
introduced this kind of mountain slide

00:44:48,730 --> 00:44:53,829
you know which is representing the

00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:55,480
Drupal 8 product strategy it's like

00:44:53,829 --> 00:44:56,920
where do we want to go from a product

00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:59,559
point of view and so I'm gonna use this

00:44:56,920 --> 00:45:01,749
framework in this presentation again to

00:44:59,559 --> 00:45:02,560
help you understand the progress we've

00:45:01,749 --> 00:45:05,170
made and where we

00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:07,330
want to go next so first I'd like to

00:45:05,170 --> 00:45:10,000
talk about the first strategic track

00:45:07,330 --> 00:45:12,430
which is to make Drupal easy for content

00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:14,260
creators and site builders right and you

00:45:12,430 --> 00:45:16,870
can see some of the initiatives that we

00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:18,250
have on this track and then for each of

00:45:16,870 --> 00:45:20,410
the initiatives by the way we have

00:45:18,250 --> 00:45:25,620
roadmaps and plants and so it's kind of

00:45:20,410 --> 00:45:31,120
like you know it cascades down so first

00:45:25,620 --> 00:45:34,090
let's look at layouts so I'm going to

00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:36,130
show you a video of the progress we've

00:45:34,090 --> 00:45:38,320
made in the layout builder this video

00:45:36,130 --> 00:45:40,200
actually will use umami which is another

00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:42,850
initiative it's kind of nice to see

00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:44,920
those initiatives work together if you

00:45:42,850 --> 00:45:46,360
will so I'm gonna hit play and we're

00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:51,730
gonna watch it together and then we'll

00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:54,550
talk about it umami is a website with

00:45:51,730 --> 00:45:57,010
recipes one of them mommies recipes was

00:45:54,550 --> 00:45:58,390
just featured on a TV show because the

00:45:57,010 --> 00:45:59,950
featured recipe is getting so much

00:45:58,390 --> 00:46:01,840
traffic from people who are watching the

00:45:59,950 --> 00:46:04,390
TV show we want to take advantage of

00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:06,850
that we don't have time to involve our

00:46:04,390 --> 00:46:09,130
development team it's too slow as an

00:46:06,850 --> 00:46:11,380
umami editor I've been tasked with

00:46:09,130 --> 00:46:13,180
creating and adding a new banner on the

00:46:11,380 --> 00:46:15,520
recipe page that links to a special

00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:17,730
offer I'll use the layout builder to do

00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:17,730
this

00:46:20,179 --> 00:46:25,139
this banner is new content that doesn't

00:46:22,799 --> 00:46:26,999
exist elsewhere on the site so I start

00:46:25,139 --> 00:46:29,419
by creating a new block and entering the

00:46:26,999 --> 00:46:29,419
content

00:46:37,650 --> 00:46:41,579
since I'm using layout builder I

00:46:39,509 --> 00:46:46,380
immediately get a preview of what the

00:46:41,579 --> 00:46:47,549
banner will look like it looks good but

00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:49,319
I think it would be better to replace

00:46:47,549 --> 00:46:51,569
the existing image with the new banner

00:46:49,319 --> 00:46:53,579
so I delete the old image and using

00:46:51,569 --> 00:46:55,559
layout builders drag and drop I can move

00:46:53,579 --> 00:46:58,829
the new banner into the place that the

00:46:55,559 --> 00:47:00,869
old image was in it can be cumbersome to

00:46:58,829 --> 00:47:02,819
move large items like this so I used the

00:47:00,869 --> 00:47:04,799
toggle preview checkbox to show small

00:47:02,819 --> 00:47:07,259
textual representations of the BOK

00:47:04,799 --> 00:47:09,859
instead this makes it very easy and fast

00:47:07,259 --> 00:47:09,859
to move things

00:47:13,609 --> 00:47:17,910
alternatively I could use the keyboard

00:47:15,930 --> 00:47:19,440
or screen reader to navigate and use the

00:47:17,910 --> 00:47:21,150
layout builder because it conforms to

00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:22,260
web content accessibility guidelines

00:47:21,150 --> 00:47:25,140
recommended by the World Wide Web

00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:28,560
Consortium this time is its

00:47:25,140 --> 00:47:30,510
accessibility if you are a keyboard user

00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:32,280
is actually very fast in this example

00:47:30,510 --> 00:47:40,560
the block is being moved using a MIDI

00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:42,030
keyboard the layout builder supports all

00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:43,950
the basic use cases that you've come to

00:47:42,030 --> 00:47:46,260
expect but it also supports more complex

00:47:43,950 --> 00:47:48,089
workflows for example you can send

00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:50,070
layouts through a staging or approval

00:47:48,089 --> 00:47:51,660
workflow as such this recipe has

00:47:50,070 --> 00:47:53,760
remained unchanged throughout this

00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:55,920
editing process now that I'm happy with

00:47:53,760 --> 00:48:00,810
the way the page looks I can publish it

00:47:55,920 --> 00:48:01,980
right from the same interface staging

00:48:00,810 --> 00:48:03,450
layouts is not something that many

00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:05,609
systems support the triples layout

00:48:03,450 --> 00:48:07,619
builder does in this example we showed a

00:48:05,609 --> 00:48:09,450
fairly simple workflow but because it

00:48:07,619 --> 00:48:11,070
leverages drupal's powerful workflow

00:48:09,450 --> 00:48:15,720
engine it can handle very advanced

00:48:11,070 --> 00:48:16,890
workflows too I now see my new banner on

00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:19,440
the published page and it looks

00:48:16,890 --> 00:48:21,180
fantastic as you can see I was able to

00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:23,460
add a banner in just a few minutes and

00:48:21,180 --> 00:48:25,230
with Drupal's workflow integration I was

00:48:23,460 --> 00:48:33,190
able to do that safely no need to

00:48:25,230 --> 00:48:35,140
involve our developers yeah please mark

00:48:33,190 --> 00:48:36,819
instead without any way out of a single

00:48:35,140 --> 00:48:39,160
page let's edit the layout of a

00:48:36,819 --> 00:48:41,140
collection of pages this is particularly

00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:43,750
useful for large sites with hundreds of

00:48:41,140 --> 00:48:46,030
thousands of pages ooh mommy did a

00:48:43,750 --> 00:48:47,890
usability study at its recipe pages and

00:48:46,030 --> 00:48:49,720
one of the takeaways was that users get

00:48:47,890 --> 00:48:52,660
confused with the white space below the

00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:54,220
image the UX and design teams have

00:48:52,660 --> 00:48:55,990
recommended that we display the recipe

00:48:54,220 --> 00:48:58,839
information next to each other rather

00:48:55,990 --> 00:49:00,520
than stack below each other we have

00:48:58,839 --> 00:49:02,260
hundreds of recipes on our website and

00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:04,480
it would be very tedious to update them

00:49:02,260 --> 00:49:06,339
one by one fortunately I can use layout

00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:08,170
builder to update all recipe layouts at

00:49:06,339 --> 00:49:10,990
once by modifying the default layout for

00:49:08,170 --> 00:49:14,220
all recipes here we are looking at the

00:49:10,990 --> 00:49:14,220
layout template for a recipe

00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:22,520
I've added a new four column region in

00:49:21,079 --> 00:49:24,740
between the image and the ingredients

00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:28,569
and now I can drag and wrap each of the

00:49:24,740 --> 00:49:28,569
recipe quick stats into those columns

00:49:35,670 --> 00:49:40,380
after saving the new default layout I go

00:49:38,490 --> 00:49:43,160
to my content list page click on a

00:49:40,380 --> 00:49:43,160
random recipe

00:49:43,589 --> 00:49:49,410
and I concede that the new layout has

00:49:45,539 --> 00:49:51,209
been applied much better being able to

00:49:49,410 --> 00:49:53,099
edit template layouts like this is a

00:49:51,209 --> 00:49:55,499
powerful differentiator from other

00:49:53,099 --> 00:49:58,699
layout builders and it's a huge time

00:49:55,499 --> 00:50:01,939
saver for sites with lots of content

00:49:58,699 --> 00:50:01,939
there we go

00:50:08,910 --> 00:50:13,990
in some amazing work actually do believe

00:50:11,470 --> 00:50:16,120
we leapfrog the competition with this

00:50:13,990 --> 00:50:19,090
you know because not only what you just

00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:21,850
saw not only can we support basic case

00:50:19,090 --> 00:50:24,610
use cases like maybe you know one of

00:50:21,850 --> 00:50:27,610
pages where we can also support all of

00:50:24,610 --> 00:50:30,130
these advanced use cases now like

00:50:27,610 --> 00:50:32,200
template layouts like you saw or these

00:50:30,130 --> 00:50:33,910
layout workflows I mean these are things

00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:36,310
that are not available in our

00:50:33,910 --> 00:50:37,510
competitors they are building tools the

00:50:36,310 --> 00:50:40,150
fact that the layer builder is

00:50:37,510 --> 00:50:42,550
accessible it's huge - you know and you

00:50:40,150 --> 00:50:44,140
guys saw that but that's a big deal and

00:50:42,550 --> 00:50:47,110
something that we should all be very

00:50:44,140 --> 00:50:48,970
very proud of it's hard work but we did

00:50:47,110 --> 00:50:51,640
it and the good news is that this will

00:50:48,970 --> 00:50:53,880
ship with eight point seven in three

00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:53,880
weeks

00:50:58,930 --> 00:51:04,440
yeah it's awesome in total a hundred and

00:51:02,589 --> 00:51:07,839
twenty three people contributed to this

00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:10,289
and I can tell you from spending time

00:51:07,839 --> 00:51:12,670
with them or some of them know to help

00:51:10,289 --> 00:51:15,039
123 but some of the bigger names on this

00:51:12,670 --> 00:51:17,470
screen they worked weekends they worked

00:51:15,039 --> 00:51:19,510
nights they gave up vacation days to get

00:51:17,470 --> 00:51:21,250
this table for eight point seven like

00:51:19,510 --> 00:51:23,640
this team deserves a big round of

00:51:21,250 --> 00:51:23,640
applause

00:51:30,099 --> 00:51:36,530
right 68 organizations supported many of

00:51:34,609 --> 00:51:44,630
these individual contributors so also

00:51:36,530 --> 00:51:46,130
let's give them an applause as well next

00:51:44,630 --> 00:51:48,560
I'm going to talk about the layout

00:51:46,130 --> 00:51:51,710
builder and the layout initiative which

00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:53,840
originally was started by Aaron as

00:51:51,710 --> 00:51:55,310
Leslie mentioned and so I have a video

00:51:53,840 --> 00:52:00,109
about that as well we're gonna play it

00:51:55,310 --> 00:52:02,180
now mommy we have the ability to display

00:52:00,109 --> 00:52:04,060
additional related photos and videos at

00:52:02,180 --> 00:52:07,070
the bottom of our articles on our site

00:52:04,060 --> 00:52:08,780
we use Drupal eights media library which

00:52:07,070 --> 00:52:12,470
makes it really easy to create and reuse

00:52:08,780 --> 00:52:14,390
multiple kinds of media as a new mommy

00:52:12,470 --> 00:52:16,070
editor I was tasked with adding some

00:52:14,390 --> 00:52:19,220
mushroom photos to the end of an article

00:52:16,070 --> 00:52:21,650
about mushrooms this is where the media

00:52:19,220 --> 00:52:24,760
library comes in handy I can edit the

00:52:21,650 --> 00:52:24,760
article scroll to the bottom

00:52:27,170 --> 00:52:32,280
the media library opens and I can see

00:52:29,970 --> 00:52:34,079
media used elsewhere on the site one of

00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:36,690
the existing images is of a mushroom so

00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:38,160
I go ahead and select that I want more

00:52:36,690 --> 00:52:40,380
than one photo though so I'll upload a

00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:42,030
few more I can upload as many files at

00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:44,640
once as I need to so I choose three

00:52:42,030 --> 00:52:45,839
images of mushrooms once they're done

00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:47,760
uploading I noticed that one of them

00:52:45,839 --> 00:52:49,349
isn't a mushroom that's okay though

00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:55,710
because it's easy to remove that item

00:52:49,349 --> 00:52:58,140
before saving once I enter any required

00:52:55,710 --> 00:52:59,549
fields metadata in this case I can save

00:52:58,140 --> 00:53:01,799
and immediately insert the new media

00:52:59,549 --> 00:53:03,450
into the field but I choose save and

00:53:01,799 --> 00:53:05,609
select because I want to add more media

00:53:03,450 --> 00:53:07,470
this field allows images in remote video

00:53:05,609 --> 00:53:09,960
so I see a tab for each of these media

00:53:07,470 --> 00:53:12,000
types I switch to the remote video tab

00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:17,280
and paste a URL for a video hosted on

00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:19,140
Vimeo I now see both my images and video

00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:25,559
in the widget where I can rearrange them

00:53:19,140 --> 00:53:27,180
to my liking once happy I saved the

00:53:25,559 --> 00:53:28,890
article and scroll down to see my

00:53:27,180 --> 00:53:31,010
additional media displayed as I would

00:53:28,890 --> 00:53:31,010
expect

00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:36,010
[Music]

00:53:36,309 --> 00:53:47,359
well this now a lot of what you saw is

00:53:45,380 --> 00:53:49,730
stable and this the initiative actually

00:53:47,359 --> 00:53:52,430
made more progress than a you know in in

00:53:49,730 --> 00:53:54,950
the last six months then maybe previous

00:53:52,430 --> 00:53:57,619
six months chugs so they've really

00:53:54,950 --> 00:53:59,240
accelerated their progress some of these

00:53:57,619 --> 00:54:01,849
things are stable some of them are

00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:03,650
experimental and some of them are still

00:54:01,849 --> 00:54:05,450
in progress the biggest thing we

00:54:03,650 --> 00:54:08,809
probably have to do is have the WYSIWYG

00:54:05,450 --> 00:54:12,710
integration you know so they can easily

00:54:08,809 --> 00:54:14,690
embed images or videos from it in you

00:54:12,710 --> 00:54:17,030
know there is a wiki tool in Drupal so

00:54:14,690 --> 00:54:19,369
I'll keep working on that hopefully we

00:54:17,030 --> 00:54:22,849
can target that 48.8 which will be

00:54:19,369 --> 00:54:25,640
roughly six months from today in total

00:54:22,849 --> 00:54:28,130
three hundred and ten people individuals

00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:32,740
have come together to make this happen

00:54:28,130 --> 00:54:32,740
which is a crazy number yeah

00:54:36,890 --> 00:54:41,239
and a hundred and twenty two

00:54:38,829 --> 00:54:47,749
organizations have given many of these

00:54:41,239 --> 00:54:48,890
people time to work on that so right

00:54:47,749 --> 00:54:51,019
next I want to talk a little bit about

00:54:48,890 --> 00:54:55,279
the administration UI which is a newer

00:54:51,019 --> 00:54:57,499
initiative but last year I spent a lot

00:54:55,279 --> 00:55:00,460
of time actually talking to not just

00:54:57,499 --> 00:55:03,829
users but also a Drupal agency owners

00:55:00,460 --> 00:55:06,049
and so one of the biggest items of

00:55:03,829 --> 00:55:08,749
feedback that they gave me is that it

00:55:06,049 --> 00:55:11,599
can be hard to sell Drupal between

00:55:08,749 --> 00:55:13,880
quotes because of because the UI looked

00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:15,739
a little bit dated and it would tell me

00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:18,049
like you know end-users customers

00:55:15,739 --> 00:55:22,039
potential customers they're looking at

00:55:18,049 --> 00:55:24,739
more modern experience and so we decided

00:55:22,039 --> 00:55:26,720
to start this initiative and it's really

00:55:24,739 --> 00:55:28,700
important right because I do think a lot

00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:30,259
of people when they look something that

00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:32,180
looks a little bit dated they make

00:55:30,259 --> 00:55:34,369
assumptions about how the technology

00:55:32,180 --> 00:55:36,259
actually is under the hood but the

00:55:34,369 --> 00:55:38,420
reality is Drupal is really awesome

00:55:36,259 --> 00:55:41,869
under the hood we're just not good at

00:55:38,420 --> 00:55:43,789
showing it off through our UI it's also

00:55:41,869 --> 00:55:45,950
another surprise that it does look a

00:55:43,789 --> 00:55:47,900
little bit dated because if you think

00:55:45,950 --> 00:55:50,599
about it we started working on the

00:55:47,900 --> 00:55:53,720
current UI maybe almost 10 years ago

00:55:50,599 --> 00:55:55,910
when we started working on Drupal 7 and

00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:57,999
while we've made updates to it we

00:55:55,910 --> 00:56:00,589
haven't really kind of done a major

00:55:57,999 --> 00:56:03,680
refresh and so I believe it's holding

00:56:00,589 --> 00:56:05,809
back drupal's growth and so we decided

00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:08,509
to make it a priority and so the team's

00:56:05,809 --> 00:56:09,920
actually done a great job you know

00:56:08,509 --> 00:56:12,319
making progress and they came up with

00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:13,789
mock-ups and style guides and all of

00:56:12,319 --> 00:56:16,190
these things they've done usability

00:56:13,789 --> 00:56:17,869
testing you can see some of them before

00:56:16,190 --> 00:56:21,230
and after here might be a little bit too

00:56:17,869 --> 00:56:24,109
small but the summary of it is that it

00:56:21,230 --> 00:56:26,539
does look a lot more modern it feels a

00:56:24,109 --> 00:56:29,239
lot more modern there's actually much

00:56:26,539 --> 00:56:31,099
better use of space it has better

00:56:29,239 --> 00:56:33,529
accessibility you know it's better

00:56:31,099 --> 00:56:36,170
because it has more contrast it has more

00:56:33,529 --> 00:56:39,140
space to click all of these things and

00:56:36,170 --> 00:56:41,569
so pretty excited about this we don't

00:56:39,140 --> 00:56:43,369
quite know when it will be ready but

00:56:41,569 --> 00:56:46,130
we're hoping to target eight point eight

00:56:43,369 --> 00:56:47,809
or eight point nine which could actually

00:56:46,130 --> 00:56:49,410
be great timing because it's getting

00:56:47,809 --> 00:56:51,960
close to the release of Drupal 9

00:56:49,410 --> 00:56:54,120
and it would give Drupal 9 sort of a you

00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:57,360
know a fresh coat of paint if you will

00:56:54,120 --> 00:57:00,570
this is an initiative where we'd love to

00:56:57,360 --> 00:57:03,060
get more help I mean it shouldn't I mean

00:57:00,570 --> 00:57:05,160
a lot of you are experts in front of

00:57:03,060 --> 00:57:07,260
development and so we would love to get

00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:09,840
more people involved so we can get it

00:57:07,260 --> 00:57:11,580
done sooner than later so you're looking

00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:14,820
for ways to contribute this would be a

00:57:11,580 --> 00:57:17,340
great a great area I'll talk more about

00:57:14,820 --> 00:57:21,060
the contributors once it's actually in

00:57:17,340 --> 00:57:23,430
core so hopefully next time I'll go into

00:57:21,060 --> 00:57:25,320
a little bit more detail about that so

00:57:23,430 --> 00:57:27,660
that's really the first kind of track

00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:31,020
you know to make Drupal easy for content

00:57:27,660 --> 00:57:33,360
creators and site builders and it's

00:57:31,020 --> 00:57:36,120
important right because for Drupal to be

00:57:33,360 --> 00:57:38,730
successful we need to be successful with

00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:40,260
every persona it's no longer enough to

00:57:38,730 --> 00:57:42,570
just win the hearts and minds of

00:57:40,260 --> 00:57:44,310
developers we need to succeed

00:57:42,570 --> 00:57:47,040
with the marketers and the content

00:57:44,310 --> 00:57:48,900
creators the people actually you know

00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:52,290
the people spending like up to eight

00:57:48,900 --> 00:57:55,500
hours a day in Drupal creating content

00:57:52,290 --> 00:57:56,970
managing content and the benefits are

00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:59,820
huge because it allows those

00:57:56,970 --> 00:58:02,760
organizations to be more cost efficient

00:57:59,820 --> 00:58:04,920
they have to rely less on developers to

00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:07,380
get certain things done and this is

00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:10,110
important for organization small and

00:58:07,380 --> 00:58:13,350
large you know this helps the very small

00:58:10,110 --> 00:58:15,630
nonprofits and it also helps the large

00:58:13,350 --> 00:58:18,540
enterprises and arguably it will help

00:58:15,630 --> 00:58:21,120
the small nonprofits much more than the

00:58:18,540 --> 00:58:23,970
large enterprises so very exciting work

00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:25,830
I didn't talk about the workflow

00:58:23,970 --> 00:58:28,590
initiative here but they've also

00:58:25,830 --> 00:58:30,660
continued to make progress more things

00:58:28,590 --> 00:58:33,150
have become revisional like menus and

00:58:30,660 --> 00:58:34,980
taxonomy terms and so lots of great work

00:58:33,150 --> 00:58:38,970
on that initiative as well so shout out

00:58:34,980 --> 00:58:41,520
to them so that's the first track let's

00:58:38,970 --> 00:58:44,370
talk about the second track the second

00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:47,070
track is to make Drupal easy to evaluate

00:58:44,370 --> 00:58:48,750
and adopt we've done a lot of great work

00:58:47,070 --> 00:58:51,390
on this you may remember from previous

00:58:48,750 --> 00:58:53,670
keno it's where I show like all of the

00:58:51,390 --> 00:58:56,280
steps it takes to install Drupal it was

00:58:53,670 --> 00:58:58,200
I forgot the number but it was 50 plus I

00:58:56,280 --> 00:59:00,600
think we brought it down to like three

00:58:58,200 --> 00:59:01,710
steps or one step very small number of

00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:03,540
steps

00:59:01,710 --> 00:59:07,860
but that team continues to make

00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:09,930
improvements we've also made a lot of

00:59:07,860 --> 00:59:12,960
improvements on my grades

00:59:09,930 --> 00:59:15,780
so migrate and migrate API are the tools

00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:19,350
that organizations used to migrate from

00:59:15,780 --> 00:59:21,600
say Drupal 7 to Drupal 8 or from Drupal

00:59:19,350 --> 00:59:25,200
6 to Drupal 8 or even from another

00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:28,560
platform to Drupal 8 and one of the key

00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:32,220
people on that initiative is a quiet one

00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:32,970
you know Vickie and so she's a long-term

00:59:32,220 --> 00:59:34,740
contributor

00:59:32,970 --> 00:59:36,840
contributor of Drupal she's been very

00:59:34,740 --> 00:59:39,360
passionate about open source check she

00:59:36,840 --> 00:59:41,790
won the New Zealand open source award

00:59:39,360 --> 00:59:44,190
last year which is really cool and so I

00:59:41,790 --> 00:59:46,500
had a chance to interview her

00:59:44,190 --> 00:59:49,500
all the way you know in New Zealand I

00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:51,780
didn't go to New Zealand but true a

00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:54,270
Google hangout and so I'm gonna play a

00:59:51,780 --> 01:00:02,310
little video a little video interview

00:59:54,270 --> 01:00:04,560
with Vicki right now so when I look back

01:00:02,310 --> 01:00:08,670
at what I've started working in

01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:10,770
migration this was back in 8.0 I started

01:00:08,670 --> 01:00:14,310
writing migration tests as my starting

01:00:10,770 --> 01:00:16,080
point and I have found that a test I

01:00:14,310 --> 01:00:19,560
wrote then and the ones I right now are

01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:21,240
largely the same so that proves the API

01:00:19,560 --> 01:00:22,980
is doing its job

01:00:21,240 --> 01:00:24,990
you're doing it well what has to change

01:00:22,980 --> 01:00:28,470
are some of the development tools that

01:00:24,990 --> 01:00:30,690
makes it easier we have more specifics

01:00:28,470 --> 01:00:32,250
like process plugins that allow us to do

01:00:30,690 --> 01:00:34,320
a bit more and to cover a few more edge

01:00:32,250 --> 01:00:37,860
cases that kind of thing and over time

01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:41,190
in the contribute as well the tools have

01:00:37,860 --> 01:00:44,130
expanded and grown to cover more to fix

01:00:41,190 --> 01:00:45,720
bugs what kind of stuff so we started

01:00:44,130 --> 01:00:47,910
out with a good base and over time it

01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:50,910
just gets more robust each time each

01:00:47,910 --> 01:00:52,260
iteration and in the sense it's more

01:00:50,910 --> 01:00:54,000
complete because we're covering more of

01:00:52,260 --> 01:00:57,030
those edge cases and getting water out

01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:59,670
further out can handle different sources

01:00:57,030 --> 01:01:01,680
of CSV J's time etcetera etc are all

01:00:59,670 --> 01:01:04,260
handled of course we claimed ourselves

01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:07,500
stable in 8.5 so from there on it's been

01:01:04,260 --> 01:01:11,370
again just building on that base adding

01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:13,590
bug fixes edge cases so there's really

01:01:11,370 --> 01:01:16,320
since 8.5 there's no reason that

01:01:13,590 --> 01:01:18,450
people should hold back on migrating

01:01:16,320 --> 01:01:20,880
it's certainly ready to migrate and

01:01:18,450 --> 01:01:23,600
ready to migrate now waiting for Drupal

01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:27,150
9 will not assist the migration process

01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:29,520
there are a few edge cases that still

01:01:27,150 --> 01:01:31,800
need to be finished off / primarily with

01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:33,390
multilingual and for those cases as well

01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:36,180
I would say you should start your

01:01:33,390 --> 01:01:37,920
migration now come talk to us on migrate

01:01:36,180 --> 01:01:40,080
slacker look at the issues to see where

01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:42,060
you fit in the edge cases many

01:01:40,080 --> 01:01:43,950
multilingual sites have already migrated

01:01:42,060 --> 01:01:48,110
and if you're not one of these edge

01:01:43,950 --> 01:01:57,210
cases then please begin your migration

01:01:48,110 --> 01:01:59,730
yeah for those of you that followed the

01:01:57,210 --> 01:02:01,530
commits stream if you love all of the

01:01:59,730 --> 01:02:03,860
code changes through 'pl there's not a

01:02:01,530 --> 01:02:06,630
week that goes by without several

01:02:03,860 --> 01:02:08,940
commits or improvements to the migrate

01:02:06,630 --> 01:02:13,530
api and so if you have looked at

01:02:08,940 --> 01:02:15,090
migrating to Drupal 8 you know maybe a

01:02:13,530 --> 01:02:17,400
year two years ago have a look again

01:02:15,090 --> 01:02:19,740
because the tools have really advanced

01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:22,800
so between the module readiness that I

01:02:19,740 --> 01:02:25,080
showed earlier and the maturity and the

01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:27,780
progress on the migrate API you know I

01:02:25,080 --> 01:02:29,760
do check again because you know we

01:02:27,780 --> 01:02:31,340
should be a lot more ready for you to

01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:34,520
migrate today

01:02:31,340 --> 01:02:37,380
mentioned the out-of-the-box initiative

01:02:34,520 --> 01:02:39,930
that initiative initiative is actually

01:02:37,380 --> 01:02:42,390
completed they completed its goals I

01:02:39,930 --> 01:02:44,610
should say yeah but they've also been

01:02:42,390 --> 01:02:46,380
making more progress like they're not

01:02:44,610 --> 01:02:47,910
they're completed their goals but

01:02:46,380 --> 01:02:50,220
they're continuing to make it better

01:02:47,910 --> 01:02:52,320
which is which is really awesome they

01:02:50,220 --> 01:02:54,300
have added a Spanish translation and

01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:56,700
they did that in like no time which is a

01:02:54,300 --> 01:02:59,160
great testament to drupal's multilingual

01:02:56,700 --> 01:03:03,000
capabilities they added a welcome tour

01:02:59,160 --> 01:03:03,150
to improve the accessibility of the you

01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:06,900
know

01:03:03,150 --> 01:03:08,640
Umami initiative and the theme and many

01:03:06,900 --> 01:03:11,430
many more things and so it's really

01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:13,880
exciting to see this get better and

01:03:11,430 --> 01:03:13,880
better as well

01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:19,790
187 people contributed to this yeah it's

01:03:17,580 --> 01:03:19,790
amazing

01:03:22,589 --> 01:03:28,480
and behind them or behind many of them

01:03:25,750 --> 01:03:35,200
there is 86 organizations as you can see

01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:37,570
a lot of volunteer contributions here so

01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:39,150
obviously this is really important you

01:03:37,570 --> 01:03:42,490
know especially the out-of-the-box

01:03:39,150 --> 01:03:44,470
because it makes it easier for

01:03:42,490 --> 01:03:46,900
organizations and individuals to

01:03:44,470 --> 01:03:48,970
discover and learn Drupal inserting

01:03:46,900 --> 01:03:51,550
instead of having to go to all of these

01:03:48,970 --> 01:03:53,380
steps before you have a functional

01:03:51,550 --> 01:03:56,290
Drupal site that shows the power of

01:03:53,380 --> 01:03:59,920
Drupal you can now get there in just you

01:03:56,290 --> 01:04:01,540
know 30 seconds and a few steps so

01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:03,339
that's good for sort of the grassroots

01:04:01,540 --> 01:04:05,230
adoption of Drupal if you will because

01:04:03,339 --> 01:04:07,960
people can do that themselves but it's

01:04:05,230 --> 01:04:10,210
also really good for digital agencies

01:04:07,960 --> 01:04:13,300
you know organizations that need to demo

01:04:10,210 --> 01:04:15,490
Drupal to a potential Drupal customer or

01:04:13,300 --> 01:04:19,119
potential Drupal user and so you can use

01:04:15,490 --> 01:04:20,950
this to help sell Drupal and so I think

01:04:19,119 --> 01:04:23,109
that's fantastic that we've made this

01:04:20,950 --> 01:04:26,140
much progress and that with eight point

01:04:23,109 --> 01:04:28,119
seven that's really ready to go so great

01:04:26,140 --> 01:04:33,910
job for all the people involved with

01:04:28,119 --> 01:04:35,560
that so the next track is to make it's

01:04:33,910 --> 01:04:38,470
kind of a you know there's different

01:04:35,560 --> 01:04:41,319
things in this track but it's to make

01:04:38,470 --> 01:04:43,930
Drupal more relevant and to increase the

01:04:41,319 --> 01:04:46,420
impact of Drupal an item that I want to

01:04:43,930 --> 01:04:47,920
talk about here is API first because

01:04:46,420 --> 01:04:50,640
we've spent a lot of time talking about

01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:52,359
the six month feature releases

01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:55,990
previously and I'll touch upon that

01:04:52,359 --> 01:04:58,869
again later but we achieved a major

01:04:55,990 --> 01:05:01,930
major milestone for the API first

01:04:58,869 --> 01:05:05,040
initiative and that's that JSON API got

01:05:01,930 --> 01:05:08,040
committed to Drupal eight point seven

01:05:05,040 --> 01:05:08,040
yeah

01:05:10,150 --> 01:05:16,329
there will be stable so it's shipping as

01:05:12,950 --> 01:05:19,700
a stable module in just three weeks and

01:05:16,329 --> 01:05:23,690
it's it's really very important I think

01:05:19,700 --> 01:05:26,539
for Drupal's relevance for for many many

01:05:23,690 --> 01:05:28,700
years to come but it allows you to do

01:05:26,539 --> 01:05:30,890
for those that are not familiar it

01:05:28,700 --> 01:05:34,279
allows you to get content such as

01:05:30,890 --> 01:05:37,339
articles in and out of Drupal in a

01:05:34,279 --> 01:05:39,380
programmatic way through West to Web

01:05:37,339 --> 01:05:41,569
Services like you can see on the screen

01:05:39,380 --> 01:05:43,489
and so that's really useful when you're

01:05:41,569 --> 01:05:46,130
building a mobile application or a

01:05:43,489 --> 01:05:48,170
single page JavaScript application or

01:05:46,130 --> 01:05:51,079
maybe when you want to push content to a

01:05:48,170 --> 01:05:55,130
digital kiosk or any kind of channel or

01:05:51,079 --> 01:05:58,730
platform or device Drupal's JSON API

01:05:55,130 --> 01:06:01,039
implementation is extremely complete it

01:05:58,730 --> 01:06:03,619
respects all of the permissions in

01:06:01,039 --> 01:06:06,410
Drupal it supports reading and writing

01:06:03,619 --> 01:06:09,470
content it plays nice with Drupal's

01:06:06,410 --> 01:06:11,239
versioning and translations and can

01:06:09,470 --> 01:06:14,119
literally be used for any piece of

01:06:11,239 --> 01:06:17,450
content in Drupal it's probably the most

01:06:14,119 --> 01:06:21,650
complete implementation of JSON API in

01:06:17,450 --> 01:06:24,829
the world it's really exciting and it

01:06:21,650 --> 01:06:27,380
leverages it built on years and years of

01:06:24,829 --> 01:06:31,400
work and it leverages the entity API to

01:06:27,380 --> 01:06:33,980
field a PID access API the configuration

01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:36,349
and type data API and much more

01:06:33,980 --> 01:06:38,539
and so it's deeply integrated it's

01:06:36,349 --> 01:06:41,630
robust it's not sort of slapped on you

01:06:38,539 --> 01:06:44,390
know it's really in Drupal and goes to

01:06:41,630 --> 01:06:47,089
the core of Drupal and that's super

01:06:44,390 --> 01:06:50,630
important because it extends our

01:06:47,089 --> 01:06:53,029
leadership in API first you know there's

01:06:50,630 --> 01:06:55,609
a large competitor that we have their

01:06:53,029 --> 01:07:00,440
name starts with an A and ends with B

01:06:55,609 --> 01:07:04,039
and they just announced graph QL support

01:07:00,440 --> 01:07:05,809
like a few weeks ago and not like they

01:07:04,039 --> 01:07:08,180
released it a few weeks ago they

01:07:05,809 --> 01:07:08,960
announced it to be released like later

01:07:08,180 --> 01:07:11,239
this year

01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:13,549
and so think about Drupal we've had

01:07:11,239 --> 01:07:16,099
graph QL for years we've had chase an

01:07:13,549 --> 01:07:18,470
API for years so now we're shipping with

01:07:16,099 --> 01:07:19,460
JSON API out of the box for every site

01:07:18,470 --> 01:07:22,460
to use

01:07:19,460 --> 01:07:25,280
just in three weeks and the impact of

01:07:22,460 --> 01:07:27,920
this work will be big right it will

01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:30,560
really help set up Drupal for success in

01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:31,670
the next five to ten years because it

01:07:30,560 --> 01:07:33,440
helps with different front-end

01:07:31,670 --> 01:07:36,470
applications but it also helps with

01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:41,120
back-end integrations and so the use

01:07:36,470 --> 01:07:43,040
cases are pretty fast as you can see in

01:07:41,120 --> 01:07:44,570
this slide we support all of the

01:07:43,040 --> 01:07:46,910
different configurations that you can

01:07:44,570 --> 01:07:49,340
think of which is pretty exciting

01:07:46,910 --> 01:07:51,230
a hundred and forty-six people worked on

01:07:49,340 --> 01:07:53,780
this and they've worked on JSON API

01:07:51,230 --> 01:08:03,080
specifically for two years this is the

01:07:53,780 --> 01:08:07,300
result of two years of hard work it was

01:08:03,080 --> 01:08:09,650
all started by Matteo and Winn and Gabe

01:08:07,300 --> 01:08:11,690
really jumped in as well and so the

01:08:09,650 --> 01:08:14,500
three of them I would say did an amazing

01:08:11,690 --> 01:08:17,270
job pushing this over the finish line a

01:08:14,500 --> 01:08:19,220
lot of organizations were behind this as

01:08:17,270 --> 01:08:26,390
well which was great to see so thanks to

01:08:19,220 --> 01:08:28,280
those organizations - all right so

01:08:26,390 --> 01:08:31,610
that's that track the last track I want

01:08:28,280 --> 01:08:35,120
to talk about here is sort of the green

01:08:31,610 --> 01:08:36,860
track which is about reducing total cost

01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:38,120
of ownership for developers and site

01:08:36,860 --> 01:08:39,890
owners and there's a lot of different

01:08:38,120 --> 01:08:41,660
things on this track and we've made

01:08:39,890 --> 01:08:43,940
progress on almost all of those things

01:08:41,660 --> 01:08:46,970
but I also believe there is more we need

01:08:43,940 --> 01:08:49,880
to do on this track right I feel like as

01:08:46,970 --> 01:08:52,780
we kind of complete a lot of our goals

01:08:49,880 --> 01:08:55,450
on the other tracks we need to focus or

01:08:52,780 --> 01:08:57,880
refocus some r4 efforts on this track

01:08:55,450 --> 01:09:01,160
because it's really important for Drupal

01:08:57,880 --> 01:09:03,200
you know growing adoption is a priority

01:09:01,160 --> 01:09:06,260
for us and making it easier and cheaper

01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:08,630
for individuals and organizations to use

01:09:06,260 --> 01:09:10,460
Drupal it's pretty important so let's

01:09:08,630 --> 01:09:11,990
talk a little bit more about that and I

01:09:10,460 --> 01:09:13,610
want to dive into this track and I want

01:09:11,990 --> 01:09:16,430
to touch upon two different things one

01:09:13,610 --> 01:09:19,430
is the upgrade from Drupal 7 to Drupal 8

01:09:16,430 --> 01:09:22,430
and then is the upgrade from Drupal 8 to

01:09:19,430 --> 01:09:25,820
Drupal 9 all right so let's start with 7

01:09:22,430 --> 01:09:29,450
to 8 so first question is how many of

01:09:25,820 --> 01:09:30,790
you are still on Drupal 7 or maybe have

01:09:29,450 --> 01:09:33,130
a customer that's

01:09:30,790 --> 01:09:35,310
still on Drupal seven alright that's a

01:09:33,130 --> 01:09:37,210
lot of you alright so no surprise there

01:09:35,310 --> 01:09:41,260
and so it's something that we need to

01:09:37,210 --> 01:09:45,250
talk about first of all no panic because

01:09:41,260 --> 01:09:47,580
Drupal 7 is actually still communities

01:09:45,250 --> 01:09:50,290
reported for two years and seven months

01:09:47,580 --> 01:09:54,700
two years and seven months and after

01:09:50,290 --> 01:09:56,830
that a number of vetted vendors will

01:09:54,700 --> 01:09:59,410
continue to provide support for at least

01:09:56,830 --> 01:10:02,050
three more years right so that will be

01:09:59,410 --> 01:10:03,910
commercial supports but support will be

01:10:02,050 --> 01:10:06,520
available for three more years and so

01:10:03,910 --> 01:10:09,880
that means that rupal seven is supported

01:10:06,520 --> 01:10:12,580
for at least like another five years at

01:10:09,880 --> 01:10:14,320
least another five years which is in my

01:10:12,580 --> 01:10:16,060
conversations a lot of people don't

01:10:14,320 --> 01:10:22,150
realize that they feel like they need to

01:10:16,060 --> 01:10:25,870
move off immediately now let's talk a

01:10:22,150 --> 01:10:27,520
little bit more about that so trying to

01:10:25,870 --> 01:10:30,550
we tried to figure out like what's a

01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:32,740
good kind of like analogy that we can

01:10:30,550 --> 01:10:34,630
use here but one of the challenges that

01:10:32,740 --> 01:10:37,390
we've had in the past is like when a

01:10:34,630 --> 01:10:39,160
major version goes end-of-life you kind

01:10:37,390 --> 01:10:41,530
of need to change tracks you know you

01:10:39,160 --> 01:10:43,030
need to get on the next track and it's

01:10:41,530 --> 01:10:44,650
not as simple as getting up the train

01:10:43,030 --> 01:10:46,420
and getting into the other train it's

01:10:44,650 --> 01:10:49,150
maybe it feels a little bit more like

01:10:46,420 --> 01:10:50,980
actually moving the tree not just the

01:10:49,150 --> 01:10:55,240
passengers right it can be hard because

01:10:50,980 --> 01:10:57,280
you have to rewrite custom code because

01:10:55,240 --> 01:10:58,480
we made API changes you have to actually

01:10:57,280 --> 01:11:00,490
migrate your contents

01:10:58,480 --> 01:11:03,040
you know from Drupal 7 to Drupal 8 and

01:11:00,490 --> 01:11:05,800
depending on your situation that can be

01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:09,280
hard or it can be relatively easy to but

01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:12,870
especially for large organizations large

01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:15,640
websites this can be pretty hard now a

01:11:12,870 --> 01:11:17,470
lot of organizations are starting to

01:11:15,640 --> 01:11:19,660
migrate now I hear more and more

01:11:17,470 --> 01:11:21,550
organizations that are starting to

01:11:19,660 --> 01:11:24,070
migrate and have two examples of that I

01:11:21,550 --> 01:11:25,930
decided to focus on complex

01:11:24,070 --> 01:11:29,010
organizations because that's where most

01:11:25,930 --> 01:11:31,870
of the most of the paynus so the first

01:11:29,010 --> 01:11:35,020
organization I want to talk about is the

01:11:31,870 --> 01:11:36,850
state of Georgia and Nikhil was a chief

01:11:35,020 --> 01:11:39,280
digital officer he's going to talk a

01:11:36,850 --> 01:11:41,830
little bit in the next video about their

01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:44,490
experience moving from Drupal 7 to

01:11:41,830 --> 01:11:44,490
Drupal 8

01:11:46,770 --> 01:11:50,110
something to kill Deshpande I'm the

01:11:48,670 --> 01:11:52,810
chief digital officer for the state of

01:11:50,110 --> 01:11:55,630
Georgia and I had the digital services

01:11:52,810 --> 01:11:58,960
team Mike he works with state agencies

01:11:55,630 --> 01:12:02,469
and elected officials and we host all of

01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:06,910
their sights on a group of platform we

01:12:02,469 --> 01:12:10,650
have been using Drupal 7 since 2011 we

01:12:06,910 --> 01:12:13,570
have a digital platform that hosts about

01:12:10,650 --> 01:12:16,300
110 websites as of this day making sure

01:12:13,570 --> 01:12:19,360
the content is well served from an

01:12:16,300 --> 01:12:21,670
agency perspective to our citizens which

01:12:19,360 --> 01:12:24,010
is Georgia's population is about 10.5

01:12:21,670 --> 01:12:27,550
million so we have a pretty decent

01:12:24,010 --> 01:12:30,910
traffic hitting this platform in all the

01:12:27,550 --> 01:12:34,210
110 web sites so the decision to move

01:12:30,910 --> 01:12:35,739
the group of eight was not that easy

01:12:34,210 --> 01:12:38,500
because Drupal 8 was so different from

01:12:35,739 --> 01:12:40,630
seven and also when we invest in a large

01:12:38,500 --> 01:12:43,150
project we have to show you know the

01:12:40,630 --> 01:12:45,940
rationale behind it but as we started

01:12:43,150 --> 01:12:48,130
learning more about Drupal 8 it really

01:12:45,940 --> 01:12:49,840
met the overall digital strategy and the

01:12:48,130 --> 01:12:52,090
requirements that we had set for the

01:12:49,840 --> 01:12:54,340
state which is you know we already have

01:12:52,090 --> 01:12:57,280
a federated model with Georgica bubbling

01:12:54,340 --> 01:12:59,290
up content from agency websites for

01:12:57,280 --> 01:13:02,020
example JSON API web service we

01:12:59,290 --> 01:13:03,550
basically can now connect websites and

01:13:02,020 --> 01:13:06,400
share content across each other

01:13:03,550 --> 01:13:07,540
accessibility for example for us is is

01:13:06,400 --> 01:13:09,580
non-negotiable

01:13:07,540 --> 01:13:11,020
as government like we have to make sure

01:13:09,580 --> 01:13:14,230
we comply to a certain level of

01:13:11,020 --> 01:13:16,449
accessibility so having known that to

01:13:14,230 --> 01:13:17,949
fellate in its core itself had you know

01:13:16,449 --> 01:13:20,350
those accessibility enhancements was a

01:13:17,949 --> 01:13:23,770
great knowledge to have and also use

01:13:20,350 --> 01:13:27,160
user experience in in general like I saw

01:13:23,770 --> 01:13:28,840
that it was mobile first and its basic

01:13:27,160 --> 01:13:30,160
bill which is quick because like our

01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:31,480
mobile traffic has been like

01:13:30,160 --> 01:13:33,190
skyrocketing for the last few years

01:13:31,480 --> 01:13:36,340
anyways and also seeing that the

01:13:33,190 --> 01:13:38,800
responsiveness of Drupal 8 also seeped

01:13:36,340 --> 01:13:40,210
into the back end or editorial

01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:43,300
experience as well because we have

01:13:40,210 --> 01:13:45,790
editors updating content using several

01:13:43,300 --> 01:13:47,980
devices I think overall like just the

01:13:45,790 --> 01:13:51,280
fact that the core was better inclusive

01:13:47,980 --> 01:13:53,199
of modules and dependency on contrib

01:13:51,280 --> 01:13:56,489
again you know which is great love

01:13:53,199 --> 01:13:58,830
Hunter modules but that was also

01:13:56,489 --> 01:14:01,890
good that it was aware you know

01:13:58,830 --> 01:14:03,960
well-rounded solution for us to begin

01:14:01,890 --> 01:14:05,219
with and last but not the least the

01:14:03,960 --> 01:14:08,190
community you know the community is

01:14:05,219 --> 01:14:10,950
growing we have more and more partners

01:14:08,190 --> 01:14:12,690
and you know individual contributors

01:14:10,950 --> 01:14:14,400
I think the community really kinda it

01:14:12,690 --> 01:14:17,070
was like the last piece or like you know

01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:19,290
the health of it made us decide to move

01:14:17,070 --> 01:14:21,300
through foliage as far as contributing

01:14:19,290 --> 01:14:24,060
back is concerned and then the whole

01:14:21,300 --> 01:14:26,520
idea for us to implement open source was

01:14:24,060 --> 01:14:28,380
the whole contribution aspect of the

01:14:26,520 --> 01:14:30,989
community comes together and makes this

01:14:28,380 --> 01:14:33,540
a better product so I think it is our

01:14:30,989 --> 01:14:35,400
responsibility to make sure if we do

01:14:33,540 --> 01:14:38,040
something it needs to go back to the

01:14:35,400 --> 01:14:41,460
community so we have done that with

01:14:38,040 --> 01:14:44,370
Drupal 7 but as we were working on even

01:14:41,460 --> 01:14:46,050
Drupal 8 we only selected partners you

01:14:44,370 --> 01:14:49,110
know that have done a significant role

01:14:46,050 --> 01:14:50,640
and job of contributing back and that

01:14:49,110 --> 01:14:52,860
was like one of our selection criteria

01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:56,520
to be honest with you but so far we have

01:14:52,860 --> 01:14:58,260
about 36 patches contributed back I want

01:14:56,520 --> 01:15:00,450
to say we are working on making sure

01:14:58,260 --> 01:15:02,700
that we contribute some of the updates

01:15:00,450 --> 01:15:06,330
to the media module and I think we have

01:15:02,700 --> 01:15:09,719
bla bla' quest contributed back so far

01:15:06,330 --> 01:15:11,280
and again you know we as we go and work

01:15:09,719 --> 01:15:12,810
more on our platform we will be

01:15:11,280 --> 01:15:15,090
contributing back but I'm really happy

01:15:12,810 --> 01:15:16,410
that we have done that so far and the

01:15:15,090 --> 01:15:17,880
fact that everything that we are

01:15:16,410 --> 01:15:19,170
building they're building from a mindset

01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:23,570
of hard to getting it back to the

01:15:19,170 --> 01:15:23,570
community awesome yeah

01:15:27,020 --> 01:15:31,350
there's a there's a lot of different

01:15:30,060 --> 01:15:33,720
things that are liked about this video

01:15:31,350 --> 01:15:35,790
one it's honest you know they said it's

01:15:33,720 --> 01:15:37,560
hard but it was worth it I hope I hope

01:15:35,790 --> 01:15:39,810
you heard that in the video I also like

01:15:37,560 --> 01:15:42,540
that they're contributing back and also

01:15:39,810 --> 01:15:44,340
like that they said you know we like to

01:15:42,540 --> 01:15:46,860
work with partners that contribute back

01:15:44,340 --> 01:15:49,800
and I've heard that from others and I

01:15:46,860 --> 01:15:51,330
talked about that last time using Pfizer

01:15:49,800 --> 01:15:53,820
as an example they've learned that

01:15:51,330 --> 01:15:56,000
working with agencies that contribute

01:15:53,820 --> 01:15:58,560
that gives better results because

01:15:56,000 --> 01:16:00,690
chances of them really knowing what

01:15:58,560 --> 01:16:02,970
they're doing is much higher right and

01:16:00,690 --> 01:16:06,090
so a couple of great anecdotes there

01:16:02,970 --> 01:16:07,710
nikhil and the team or maybe not all of

01:16:06,090 --> 01:16:09,270
the team are actually here this week and

01:16:07,710 --> 01:16:10,380
so i'm sure you can go ask them

01:16:09,270 --> 01:16:14,720
questions if you're thinking about

01:16:10,380 --> 01:16:18,240
migrating from Drupal 7 to Drupal 8 I

01:16:14,720 --> 01:16:21,120
have one more video it's the example of

01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:24,180
pega which is a large technology company

01:16:21,120 --> 01:16:27,360
publicly traded company and so they also

01:16:24,180 --> 01:16:33,450
shared their experience going from 7 to

01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:34,980
Drupal 8 so I'll play that now we were

01:16:33,450 --> 01:16:39,660
looking at something that was Herculean

01:16:34,980 --> 01:16:42,000
we understood the complexities six

01:16:39,660 --> 01:16:44,760
months you just did six months to get to

01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:46,980
MVP a completely platform and redesign

01:16:44,760 --> 01:16:48,570
of the website and for extra credit we

01:16:46,980 --> 01:16:50,940
decided to integrate with our own legacy

01:16:48,570 --> 01:16:53,370
our own product and implement an atomic

01:16:50,940 --> 01:16:57,030
design system yeah piece of cake

01:16:53,370 --> 01:16:58,460
right I love cake and it was the best

01:16:57,030 --> 01:17:02,540
choice

01:16:58,460 --> 01:17:05,010
[Music]

01:17:02,540 --> 01:17:07,230
the plan was to move our to court

01:17:05,010 --> 01:17:09,869
digital properties to deploy properties

01:17:07,230 --> 01:17:11,699
that receive millions of our digital

01:17:09,869 --> 01:17:13,469
presence needs to support the business

01:17:11,699 --> 01:17:16,079
and going after our biggest strategic

01:17:13,469 --> 01:17:18,329
problems and solving them these are

01:17:16,079 --> 01:17:20,610
moving targets we need to get the most

01:17:18,329 --> 01:17:23,130
velocity we can from running a portfolio

01:17:20,610 --> 01:17:25,320
ten distinct websites through one

01:17:23,130 --> 01:17:27,059
technical plan the first thing we

01:17:25,320 --> 01:17:29,699
realized was that we couldn't swallow

01:17:27,059 --> 01:17:31,650
this whale we needed to have smaller

01:17:29,699 --> 01:17:43,590
bite-sized chunks that we could work

01:17:31,650 --> 01:17:46,079
with so we're and e7 and e8 sights done

01:17:43,590 --> 01:17:48,719
right now not even close

01:17:46,079 --> 01:17:49,650
the second thing we realized is that we

01:17:48,719 --> 01:17:51,179
couldn't do this alone

01:17:49,650 --> 01:17:53,190
or about as far from the vanilla

01:17:51,179 --> 01:17:55,320
migration as possible so we've brought

01:17:53,190 --> 01:17:57,210
in partners to augment our staff in key

01:17:55,320 --> 01:17:59,309
areas we had thousands of pages of

01:17:57,210 --> 01:18:01,230
content all needed to be migrated to new

01:17:59,309 --> 01:18:03,000
templates we had many complex

01:18:01,230 --> 01:18:05,520
integrations including analytics

01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:06,150
multi-language federated search good buy

01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:09,840
beans

01:18:06,150 --> 01:18:11,489
low paragraphs and we gave back to the

01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:12,960
community there are a lot of really

01:18:11,489 --> 01:18:14,429
talented folks out there and they

01:18:12,960 --> 01:18:16,380
supported us during some of our most

01:18:14,429 --> 01:18:17,880
difficult challenges looking back I

01:18:16,380 --> 01:18:19,530
think this is a case that the mountain

01:18:17,880 --> 01:18:20,849
looks a lot steeper than it is and

01:18:19,530 --> 01:18:23,099
you're sure some of the train was a

01:18:20,849 --> 01:18:25,440
tough go but we did it and it feels

01:18:23,099 --> 01:18:27,150
great our web sites are faster and much

01:18:25,440 --> 01:18:29,610
easier to maintain and beam

01:18:27,150 --> 01:18:31,679
they're clean well architected they make

01:18:29,610 --> 01:18:33,510
the job of our developers much easier

01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:35,730
Drupal 8 content authoring cuts our

01:18:33,510 --> 01:18:37,260
self-service time down by a third making

01:18:35,730 --> 01:18:39,590
it much more efficient for our content

01:18:37,260 --> 01:18:39,590
authors

01:18:40,570 --> 01:18:45,110
in reality we didn't have a choice we've

01:18:43,430 --> 01:18:47,720
got to keep pace with the evolutionary

01:18:45,110 --> 01:18:49,640
needs of our organization and we see the

01:18:47,720 --> 01:18:51,890
switch to Drupal 8 as a generational

01:18:49,640 --> 01:18:54,290
improvement it's the kind of thing I

01:18:51,890 --> 01:18:55,220
encourage everyone to just jump into did

01:18:54,290 --> 01:18:58,370
I answer your question

01:18:55,220 --> 01:19:15,620
oh right would I migrate to Triple Eight

01:18:58,370 --> 01:19:17,570
again yes okay that's a good video it's

01:19:15,620 --> 01:19:20,390
a funny anecdote they're like I reached

01:19:17,570 --> 01:19:21,800
out to Derek one of the people in the in

01:19:20,390 --> 01:19:23,510
the video and said hey can we do an

01:19:21,800 --> 01:19:25,400
interview here are some of the questions

01:19:23,510 --> 01:19:28,610
I'm thinking about it next thing I know

01:19:25,400 --> 01:19:30,770
they came back with this video which is

01:19:28,610 --> 01:19:32,630
amazing so thanks for doing that it's a

01:19:30,770 --> 01:19:35,360
great a great video and again it's very

01:19:32,630 --> 01:19:37,460
honest right and again if they look at

01:19:35,360 --> 01:19:40,490
it to reader right lens is a complex

01:19:37,460 --> 01:19:43,520
organization with a lot of you know

01:19:40,490 --> 01:19:46,040
integrations and they decided to do it

01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:48,260
and they came out of being very happy

01:19:46,040 --> 01:19:49,970
you know it's faster it's easier they

01:19:48,260 --> 01:19:51,920
reduce their costs all of these things

01:19:49,970 --> 01:19:55,370
and so there's a lot of benefits to

01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:57,200
upgrading to Drupal 8 you can see some

01:19:55,370 --> 01:19:59,450
of them on the screen some of them were

01:19:57,200 --> 01:20:02,990
echoed by people in the video not gonna

01:19:59,450 --> 01:20:05,810
go to all of them here but go talk to

01:20:02,990 --> 01:20:07,190
you know go talk to different sponsors

01:20:05,810 --> 01:20:08,870
you know in the exhibition hall if you

01:20:07,190 --> 01:20:11,390
want to learn more about why you should

01:20:08,870 --> 01:20:14,480
migrate to Drupal 8 and why you should

01:20:11,390 --> 01:20:17,000
migrate today last thing I want to

01:20:14,480 --> 01:20:18,920
mention real quick again without going

01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:21,320
into the details here is that there are

01:20:18,920 --> 01:20:22,910
tools available in the community that

01:20:21,320 --> 01:20:25,430
can help you with this migration you

01:20:22,910 --> 01:20:27,590
know from migrating code to migrating

01:20:25,430 --> 01:20:29,540
content and data so check out those

01:20:27,590 --> 01:20:31,160
tools if you haven't they'll help you

01:20:29,540 --> 01:20:35,450
and these tools keep getting better too

01:20:31,160 --> 01:20:38,360
so another question how many people are

01:20:35,450 --> 01:20:40,640
on 7 or of a customer on 7 and are

01:20:38,360 --> 01:20:44,360
waiting for Drupal 9 how many are gonna

01:20:40,640 --> 01:20:45,620
skip a release all right some people so

01:20:44,360 --> 01:20:47,630
I want to talk a little bit about that

01:20:45,620 --> 01:20:50,630
because one of the things that we've

01:20:47,630 --> 01:20:53,059
changed is that once you are on the

01:20:50,630 --> 01:20:55,489
Drupal 8 track once you move

01:20:53,059 --> 01:20:57,710
trained from the 7th to 8th track you're

01:20:55,489 --> 01:20:59,659
gonna never have to change tracks again

01:20:57,710 --> 01:21:01,610
right and so that's pretty powerful

01:20:59,659 --> 01:21:03,320
because you're just gonna keep the Train

01:21:01,610 --> 01:21:07,159
on the track and new releases are gonna

01:21:03,320 --> 01:21:11,030
come out and the upgrade from 8 to 9 or

01:21:07,159 --> 01:21:13,219
9 to 10 will be easy and so again I

01:21:11,030 --> 01:21:15,199
speak to a lot of people that don't

01:21:13,219 --> 01:21:16,670
really understand this yet so I wanted

01:21:15,199 --> 01:21:19,219
to reiterate that so

01:21:16,670 --> 01:21:21,770
in conclusion here for this section and

01:21:19,219 --> 01:21:23,780
it's fine to stay on 7 if you don't want

01:21:21,770 --> 01:21:27,199
to move that's fine it's supported for

01:21:23,780 --> 01:21:29,469
quite some time however there are a lot

01:21:27,199 --> 01:21:31,849
of reasons to migrate to Drupal 8 and

01:21:29,469 --> 01:21:34,250
knowing that the upgrade will be easy

01:21:31,849 --> 01:21:36,079
there's real benefits in upgrading

01:21:34,250 --> 01:21:40,250
sooner than later because you get to

01:21:36,079 --> 01:21:42,559
take advantage of these of these new

01:21:40,250 --> 01:21:44,989
features and because you're on this one

01:21:42,559 --> 01:21:47,539
track after your upgrade to Drupal 8

01:21:44,989 --> 01:21:49,579
there's really no reason to wait for

01:21:47,539 --> 01:21:52,010
Drupal 9 right because the upgrade will

01:21:49,579 --> 01:21:53,750
be easy so let's talk a little bit about

01:21:52,010 --> 01:21:56,270
that in detail

01:21:53,750 --> 01:21:58,099
the path from 8 to 9 because there's a

01:21:56,270 --> 01:21:59,809
lot of questions about that as well

01:21:58,099 --> 01:22:02,289
and so I want to want to make sure I try

01:21:59,809 --> 01:22:06,440
and address some of that first of all

01:22:02,289 --> 01:22:08,900
Drupal 9 will ship in like a year and

01:22:06,440 --> 01:22:11,090
two months or so that's pretty close

01:22:08,900 --> 01:22:15,170
right and anyone feeling a little

01:22:11,090 --> 01:22:17,510
anxiety yeah so most people are pretty

01:22:15,170 --> 01:22:21,070
excited here except maybe one emoji

01:22:17,510 --> 01:22:23,599
that's a little bit more terrified but

01:22:21,070 --> 01:22:27,889
for the most part it should be exciting

01:22:23,599 --> 01:22:30,380
the target is June 2020 however we have

01:22:27,889 --> 01:22:32,179
the option to fall back to December 2020

01:22:30,380 --> 01:22:34,550
just in case we need more time to

01:22:32,179 --> 01:22:37,280
prepare but things are going really well

01:22:34,550 --> 01:22:40,820
right now and so June 2020 looks very

01:22:37,280 --> 01:22:43,579
likely I would say just as a reminder is

01:22:40,820 --> 01:22:45,590
two reasons why we need to bump the

01:22:43,579 --> 01:22:47,960
major version number from eight to nine

01:22:45,590 --> 01:22:51,429
one is because we use third-party

01:22:47,960 --> 01:22:53,539
dependencies like a symphony and

01:22:51,429 --> 01:22:55,429
Symphony we use symphony three

01:22:53,539 --> 01:22:57,829
specifically and Symphony three will be

01:22:55,429 --> 01:22:59,809
end-of-life at some point and so we need

01:22:57,829 --> 01:23:03,889
to move this infinite four or symphony

01:22:59,809 --> 01:23:06,010
five and doing that migration requires

01:23:03,889 --> 01:23:09,220
us to increase our major version number

01:23:06,010 --> 01:23:11,080
because of you know API changes but we

01:23:09,220 --> 01:23:14,640
also get all of the benefits of symphony

01:23:11,080 --> 01:23:17,470
four or five right so he gets us better

01:23:14,640 --> 01:23:18,820
dependency so to speak and the second

01:23:17,470 --> 01:23:20,980
reason is that we need to drop

01:23:18,820 --> 01:23:23,920
deprecated code and I'll talk more about

01:23:20,980 --> 01:23:26,470
that in a second but we have a new

01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:28,510
innovation model now where we can

01:23:26,470 --> 01:23:30,370
innovate and add new features and ship

01:23:28,510 --> 01:23:33,640
new capabilities like the ones I showed

01:23:30,370 --> 01:23:36,340
layouts and media but to maintain

01:23:33,640 --> 01:23:38,440
backwards compatibility you know we do

01:23:36,340 --> 01:23:41,020
manage deprecated code and at some point

01:23:38,440 --> 01:23:43,330
that becomes overhead right and so

01:23:41,020 --> 01:23:45,520
dropping the deprecated codes improves

01:23:43,330 --> 01:23:48,310
maintainability improves performance

01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:50,800
improves a developer experience and so

01:23:48,310 --> 01:23:53,170
forth so the way we innovate as a quick

01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:56,290
reminder because it started with Drupal

01:23:53,170 --> 01:23:59,560
8 is that we now have major and minor

01:23:56,290 --> 01:24:02,320
and patch releases and we do a minor

01:23:59,560 --> 01:24:04,210
release every six months and eight point

01:24:02,320 --> 01:24:06,750
seven is an example of a minor release

01:24:04,210 --> 01:24:11,260
it can come jam-packed with new features

01:24:06,750 --> 01:24:14,890
and so the way that actually works in a

01:24:11,260 --> 01:24:17,440
little bit more detail is you know as we

01:24:14,890 --> 01:24:19,690
add new code to these releases we made

01:24:17,440 --> 01:24:22,140
deprecated all the API so you can sort

01:24:19,690 --> 01:24:25,620
of see that here visually on the screen

01:24:22,140 --> 01:24:28,120
and we keep doing this but at some point

01:24:25,620 --> 01:24:30,520
we will have to upgrade these

01:24:28,120 --> 01:24:32,290
third-party dependencies because you

01:24:30,520 --> 01:24:34,480
know we don't want you to use insecure

01:24:32,290 --> 01:24:36,370
versions of those alright so let's take

01:24:34,480 --> 01:24:39,370
symphony for example at some point we

01:24:36,370 --> 01:24:44,980
need to go to you know symphony 4 or

01:24:39,370 --> 01:24:46,720
maybe symphony 5 and when we do that we

01:24:44,980 --> 01:24:49,300
have to bump the release from eight

01:24:46,720 --> 01:24:51,430
point nine in this example to nine and

01:24:49,300 --> 01:24:53,410
then we can also actually drop all of

01:24:51,430 --> 01:24:55,570
this deprecated code and sort of clean

01:24:53,410 --> 01:25:00,700
up some of our code base and that's what

01:24:55,570 --> 01:25:03,040
we will call triple nine so what does

01:25:00,700 --> 01:25:05,740
that mean well it means that ripple nine

01:25:03,040 --> 01:25:08,800
is basically identical to a Drupal eight

01:25:05,740 --> 01:25:11,350
point nine - the deprecated codes

01:25:08,800 --> 01:25:13,180
plus the updated third-party

01:25:11,350 --> 01:25:15,070
dependencies right that's really what it

01:25:13,180 --> 01:25:19,130
means and so there's not like major new

01:25:15,070 --> 01:25:22,280
things in nine compared to eight point

01:25:19,130 --> 01:25:25,460
and that's important because any Drupal

01:25:22,280 --> 01:25:28,960
8 module that does not use deprecated

01:25:25,460 --> 01:25:38,150
code will continue to work with Drupal 9

01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:40,400
yes and so that means that the upgrade

01:25:38,150 --> 01:25:45,530
from eight to nine should be easy all

01:25:40,400 --> 01:25:48,289
right um so that's kind of a big deal

01:25:45,530 --> 01:25:50,989
because again seven to eight gonna be

01:25:48,289 --> 01:25:53,239
pretty hard but Drupal two you know

01:25:50,989 --> 01:25:55,909
eight to nine will be easy now there's a

01:25:53,239 --> 01:26:02,659
little Asterix there you know you see

01:25:55,909 --> 01:26:06,139
that I can zoom into it and it's

01:26:02,659 --> 01:26:07,999
assuming no deprecated code is used by

01:26:06,139 --> 01:26:10,039
these modules once I want to talk a

01:26:07,999 --> 01:26:12,110
little bit more about that because the

01:26:10,039 --> 01:26:14,239
call to action that I'll get to in a few

01:26:12,110 --> 01:26:16,940
minutes is that we as a community need

01:26:14,239 --> 01:26:20,420
to start managing deprecated code well

01:26:16,940 --> 01:26:21,789
alright so what is deprecated codes it's

01:26:20,420 --> 01:26:25,070
a good question

01:26:21,789 --> 01:26:26,900
I'll keep it fairly high-level but

01:26:25,070 --> 01:26:30,769
here's an example of maybe something

01:26:26,900 --> 01:26:33,949
that was in Drupal 8.4 file unmanaged

01:26:30,769 --> 01:26:36,170
copy it's a function and at some point

01:26:33,949 --> 01:26:38,480
we decided to change it to a service

01:26:36,170 --> 01:26:40,010
model as you can see here right the

01:26:38,480 --> 01:26:43,190
after looks a little bit more complex

01:26:40,010 --> 01:26:44,780
maybe but all sorts of advantages that

01:26:43,190 --> 01:26:46,969
you don't have with the original and so

01:26:44,780 --> 01:26:49,429
we added the you know Drupal service

01:26:46,969 --> 01:26:52,670
thing and we deprecated the file

01:26:49,429 --> 01:26:54,980
unmanaged copy and so what that means is

01:26:52,670 --> 01:26:56,780
that modules need to be updated and in

01:26:54,980 --> 01:26:59,059
this case you need to do like a search

01:26:56,780 --> 01:27:01,780
and replace if you go from file

01:26:59,059 --> 01:27:03,710
unmanaged copy to Drupal service

01:27:01,780 --> 01:27:07,460
alright so that's an example of

01:27:03,710 --> 01:27:10,059
deprecated codes and so then the

01:27:07,460 --> 01:27:13,639
question is when Drupal 9 gets released

01:27:10,059 --> 01:27:16,309
the original file unmanaged copy will

01:27:13,639 --> 01:27:17,780
stop working so by the time Drupal 9 is

01:27:16,309 --> 01:27:20,659
released you need to have done that

01:27:17,780 --> 01:27:22,969
search and replace so that's kind of the

01:27:20,659 --> 01:27:25,940
idea and so then the question is how do

01:27:22,969 --> 01:27:27,860
I know if my site uses any deprecated

01:27:25,940 --> 01:27:30,320
code how do I know that my site will be

01:27:27,860 --> 01:27:32,810
ready for Drupal

01:27:30,320 --> 01:27:35,750
and so good news is there's a bunch of

01:27:32,810 --> 01:27:37,910
tools so Matic lemon from the Commerce

01:27:35,750 --> 01:27:41,150
guys he actually built something called

01:27:37,910 --> 01:27:45,200
Drupal check you can download it and you

01:27:41,150 --> 01:27:47,450
can run it against your module and when

01:27:45,200 --> 01:27:50,390
you do that it will tell you all of the

01:27:47,450 --> 01:27:53,360
sort of errors that you have meaning all

01:27:50,390 --> 01:27:55,520
of the uses of deprecated code in your

01:27:53,360 --> 01:27:58,730
module you can see it's pretty easy you

01:27:55,520 --> 01:28:00,590
can see uh line 40 of this file I have a

01:27:58,730 --> 01:28:02,630
call that call needs to be replaced with

01:28:00,590 --> 01:28:05,540
something else that tool is available

01:28:02,630 --> 01:28:14,600
today and I encourage you to use it

01:28:05,540 --> 01:28:16,250
today yeah the other thing is like

01:28:14,600 --> 01:28:19,310
there's really no reason to wait for

01:28:16,250 --> 01:28:21,410
Drupal 9 to do this because again if you

01:28:19,310 --> 01:28:23,870
do this today and you should change your

01:28:21,410 --> 01:28:26,060
code today you actually get to benefit

01:28:23,870 --> 01:28:28,190
from these changes today as well right

01:28:26,060 --> 01:28:31,070
because you would use the new code in

01:28:28,190 --> 01:28:32,930
Drupal 8 already I would also encourage

01:28:31,070 --> 01:28:35,030
you to integrate this tool in your

01:28:32,930 --> 01:28:36,500
developer workflows and your automated

01:28:35,030 --> 01:28:39,080
developer workflow so that you can

01:28:36,500 --> 01:28:42,130
always keep checking its deprecated and

01:28:39,080 --> 01:28:42,130
what's not deprecated

01:28:42,250 --> 01:28:46,790
there's also another tool that we've

01:28:45,080 --> 01:28:50,570
been building which is a more visual

01:28:46,790 --> 01:28:53,510
tool it's the upgrade status module and

01:28:50,570 --> 01:28:55,850
what it does is it basically will use

01:28:53,510 --> 01:28:58,280
Drupal check but it will scan each of

01:28:55,850 --> 01:29:00,200
your modules one by one as you can see

01:28:58,280 --> 01:29:01,760
here and while it's scanning you can

01:29:00,200 --> 01:29:03,950
actually start looking at some of these

01:29:01,760 --> 01:29:06,200
error logs this is all from within

01:29:03,950 --> 01:29:08,120
Drupal so if you're a site owner maybe

01:29:06,200 --> 01:29:11,330
less technical he can go in and check a

01:29:08,120 --> 01:29:12,830
are we ready you can actually from there

01:29:11,330 --> 01:29:14,660
you can link to documentation and you

01:29:12,830 --> 01:29:16,220
can actually see it look deprecated on

01:29:14,660 --> 01:29:18,170
the screen and it will tell you what to

01:29:16,220 --> 01:29:20,170
change and so it's very easy to figure

01:29:18,170 --> 01:29:23,960
out what to change and how to change it

01:29:20,170 --> 01:29:26,090
you can export it as well get a full

01:29:23,960 --> 01:29:29,120
export of all the deprecations in all

01:29:26,090 --> 01:29:32,020
their sites modules you can send that to

01:29:29,120 --> 01:29:36,440
your favorite developer

01:29:32,020 --> 01:29:39,380
and so it's a great little tool and so

01:29:36,440 --> 01:29:41,240
you can install it on your site and if

01:29:39,380 --> 01:29:44,150
you're maybe a less technical or or you

01:29:41,240 --> 01:29:47,210
prefer of you know sort of a UI based

01:29:44,150 --> 01:29:49,040
solution you can use this to see if your

01:29:47,210 --> 01:29:51,110
site is ready and if there's no

01:29:49,040 --> 01:29:53,510
deprecations if there's no errors it

01:29:51,110 --> 01:29:55,550
should mean that the upgrade is easy

01:29:53,510 --> 01:29:58,250
right let's assuming we can actually

01:29:55,550 --> 01:30:00,760
catch all of the applications but and so

01:29:58,250 --> 01:30:00,760
it's pretty cool

01:30:01,030 --> 01:30:05,240
Duane from Hampton actually use this

01:30:04,730 --> 01:30:09,170
tool

01:30:05,240 --> 01:30:12,170
Annie ran Drupal check against all 7,000

01:30:09,170 --> 01:30:16,730
contributed modules as a fun thing to do

01:30:12,170 --> 01:30:18,680
I bet but basically we looked at that

01:30:16,730 --> 01:30:24,020
data a little bit more but basically

01:30:18,680 --> 01:30:26,090
Duane said I think it was 44% of those

01:30:24,020 --> 01:30:28,460
7,000 modules so a little bit less than

01:30:26,090 --> 01:30:30,950
half of those modules they actually have

01:30:28,460 --> 01:30:32,630
notification violations today which

01:30:30,950 --> 01:30:37,060
means they should already be ready for

01:30:32,630 --> 01:30:37,060
Drupal 9 which is pretty good oh yeah

01:30:38,260 --> 01:30:42,920
and then you can see the orange thing

01:30:40,700 --> 01:30:45,170
which is all bit more than a quarter the

01:30:42,920 --> 01:30:47,570
only these modules have only either

01:30:45,170 --> 01:30:49,010
between one and five deprecations there

01:30:47,570 --> 01:30:52,340
should be relatively easy to upgrade

01:30:49,010 --> 01:30:54,980
actually upgraded my own site or have

01:30:52,340 --> 01:30:58,130
some of my own modules and it was very

01:30:54,980 --> 01:31:01,340
easy for me in my case I should say

01:30:58,130 --> 01:31:03,890
because all of my deprecations were

01:31:01,340 --> 01:31:05,390
search and replace some of them are a

01:31:03,890 --> 01:31:07,280
little bit more involved in search and

01:31:05,390 --> 01:31:08,960
replace but in my case are all search

01:31:07,280 --> 01:31:11,300
and replace and my site was ready for

01:31:08,960 --> 01:31:13,970
Drupal 9 in 10 minutes which is pretty

01:31:11,300 --> 01:31:16,910
cool and then about a quarter of the

01:31:13,970 --> 01:31:19,340
modules of the 7,000 modules have five

01:31:16,910 --> 01:31:22,970
or more deprecations all right so they

01:31:19,340 --> 01:31:27,200
need more work and so what this all

01:31:22,970 --> 01:31:30,680
means is in terms of Karl to action you

01:31:27,200 --> 01:31:32,750
know we should stop using deprecated

01:31:30,680 --> 01:31:34,790
code in core and so we have a little bit

01:31:32,750 --> 01:31:36,740
more than one year to remove all of the

01:31:34,790 --> 01:31:39,230
deprecated codes from all of these

01:31:36,740 --> 01:31:41,240
modules including our own custom modules

01:31:39,230 --> 01:31:44,240
not just a contribute

01:31:41,240 --> 01:31:47,120
we're also gonna make Drupal 8.8 the

01:31:44,240 --> 01:31:48,920
last release to a deprecated code and so

01:31:47,120 --> 01:31:51,140
it will be stable if you will in terms

01:31:48,920 --> 01:31:53,930
of no new deprecations being introduced

01:31:51,140 --> 01:31:56,780
and so that allows you to kind of use

01:31:53,930 --> 01:32:01,640
six months of the stableness to really

01:31:56,780 --> 01:32:05,000
get ready for Drupal 9 I will say that

01:32:01,640 --> 01:32:07,490
we should look at ways to expand Drupal

01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:10,040
check to also scan tweak and JavaScript

01:32:07,490 --> 01:32:13,580
which it doesn't do today it's focused

01:32:10,040 --> 01:32:17,000
on PHP code so that's an area where we

01:32:13,580 --> 01:32:19,190
would love to get more contribution and

01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:20,930
so that's a little bit about the upgrade

01:32:19,190 --> 01:32:23,000
from eight to nine all right so

01:32:20,930 --> 01:32:24,740
hopefully you'll understand that once

01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:27,620
you're on eight the upgrade to nine

01:32:24,740 --> 01:32:31,310
should be relatively easy another thing

01:32:27,620 --> 01:32:34,400
I would love this years work on is it's

01:32:31,310 --> 01:32:36,830
automatic updates it's something that we

01:32:34,400 --> 01:32:39,160
have made some progress on but arguably

01:32:36,830 --> 01:32:41,560
not enough I personally believe that

01:32:39,160 --> 01:32:44,930
it's one of the most important things

01:32:41,560 --> 01:32:48,710
for us to work on you know making Drupal

01:32:44,930 --> 01:32:51,140
updates easier is really important and

01:32:48,710 --> 01:32:53,420
today it's you know fairly complex still

01:32:51,140 --> 01:32:55,550
right here's an example of a minor

01:32:53,420 --> 01:32:57,410
update or patch update you need to do

01:32:55,550 --> 01:32:59,360
all of these commands obviously if you

01:32:57,410 --> 01:33:03,470
can script them but you have to update

01:32:59,360 --> 01:33:05,270
code and databases and configuration you

01:33:03,470 --> 01:33:07,130
have to do that on your localhost and

01:33:05,270 --> 01:33:09,980
deploy to production and so really it's

01:33:07,130 --> 01:33:13,370
a lot of steps too many steps and it

01:33:09,980 --> 01:33:14,780
requires a developer and you can you may

01:33:13,370 --> 01:33:17,330
have to do this multiple times a month

01:33:14,780 --> 01:33:19,400
right so how do we make that easy and so

01:33:17,330 --> 01:33:22,760
I hope that this week we can spend some

01:33:19,400 --> 01:33:26,360
time on that I hope you can refocus some

01:33:22,760 --> 01:33:28,580
of our energy on this problem we need to

01:33:26,360 --> 01:33:31,400
work on composer support in core and

01:33:28,580 --> 01:33:33,920
contribute to find help to coordinate

01:33:31,400 --> 01:33:36,560
some of these initiatives good news is

01:33:33,920 --> 01:33:38,930
though the European Union has decided to

01:33:36,560 --> 01:33:41,890
provide some funding for this which is

01:33:38,930 --> 01:33:41,890
pretty exciting yeah

01:33:43,800 --> 01:33:48,940
so I feel I feel pretty good that we're

01:33:46,570 --> 01:33:51,370
gonna make progress and I'm gonna I hope

01:33:48,940 --> 01:33:53,260
that in Drupal come Amsterdam in six

01:33:51,370 --> 01:33:55,630
months I'll be able to stand on stage

01:33:53,260 --> 01:33:57,970
and actually give some sort of demo that

01:33:55,630 --> 01:34:00,070
would be my goal so obviously I would

01:33:57,970 --> 01:34:01,660
need your help with that but that would

01:34:00,070 --> 01:34:06,150
be fantastic and I think it would really

01:34:01,660 --> 01:34:11,020
kind of round out the drupal 8 release

01:34:06,150 --> 01:34:13,120
you know cycle alright so obviously all

01:34:11,020 --> 01:34:15,190
of that work is important because it

01:34:13,120 --> 01:34:17,170
helps with security it helps make it

01:34:15,190 --> 01:34:19,200
easier for organizations to maintain

01:34:17,170 --> 01:34:22,570
Drupal and again it benefits

01:34:19,200 --> 01:34:24,970
organizations small and large and again

01:34:22,570 --> 01:34:28,030
probably more beneficial for small

01:34:24,970 --> 01:34:31,180
organizations who can afford to have

01:34:28,030 --> 01:34:33,510
developers on staff right so very

01:34:31,180 --> 01:34:37,210
important work and lots of good progress

01:34:33,510 --> 01:34:38,710
and so is this kind of you know sort of

01:34:37,210 --> 01:34:40,090
sums it up a little bit all of the

01:34:38,710 --> 01:34:42,100
different things that we've been focused

01:34:40,090 --> 01:34:44,770
on as you can see we've been working our

01:34:42,100 --> 01:34:46,420
way up the mountain to the flag we've

01:34:44,770 --> 01:34:48,960
made a lot of great progress and

01:34:46,420 --> 01:34:51,400
personally I feel pretty pumped actually

01:34:48,960 --> 01:34:54,100
even though I may not communicate that

01:34:51,400 --> 01:34:56,530
well but I feel pretty pumped about all

01:34:54,100 --> 01:35:01,690
of the progress we've made between

01:34:56,530 --> 01:35:04,540
layouts and media and preparing for

01:35:01,690 --> 01:35:06,910
Drupal 9 and in all of these things and

01:35:04,540 --> 01:35:08,710
I really feel like we found like your

01:35:06,910 --> 01:35:10,900
rhythm and a cadence and a heartbeat

01:35:08,710 --> 01:35:13,870
every six months were shipping new

01:35:10,900 --> 01:35:16,210
features are innovating you know things

01:35:13,870 --> 01:35:18,670
are growing I feel like we're ready for

01:35:16,210 --> 01:35:21,370
the future with API first and things

01:35:18,670 --> 01:35:23,800
like that and we're making Drupal easier

01:35:21,370 --> 01:35:26,650
and easier to use we're making Drupal

01:35:23,800 --> 01:35:29,950
easier and easier to maintain and I'm

01:35:26,650 --> 01:35:36,550
excited that the benefits basically

01:35:29,950 --> 01:35:38,380
everyone so to recap Drupal eight point

01:35:36,550 --> 01:35:42,120
seven will be released in three weeks

01:35:38,380 --> 01:35:45,280
and it's jam-packed with innovation

01:35:42,120 --> 01:35:48,350
Drupal 7 has communities report until

01:35:45,280 --> 01:35:50,090
November 2021 and will have come

01:35:48,350 --> 01:35:52,640
shall support after that for at least

01:35:50,090 --> 01:35:56,090
another three years there are many

01:35:52,640 --> 01:35:58,480
reasons to upgrade to Drupal 8 now and

01:35:56,090 --> 01:36:01,460
you should if you can

01:35:58,480 --> 01:36:05,360
Drupal 9 is started to be a real least

01:36:01,460 --> 01:36:06,640
in June 2020 and updating from eight to

01:36:05,360 --> 01:36:09,770
nine will be easy

01:36:06,640 --> 01:36:12,770
assuming we manage deprecations well and

01:36:09,770 --> 01:36:16,430
we will right I've put all of that

01:36:12,770 --> 01:36:18,290
together in this little timeline which

01:36:16,430 --> 01:36:19,940
I'll share in my slides when I share the

01:36:18,290 --> 01:36:22,340
slides in my blog maybe something you

01:36:19,940 --> 01:36:26,270
want to print out hang up next to your

01:36:22,340 --> 01:36:28,580
bed or in your cubicle send to your

01:36:26,270 --> 01:36:31,850
manager maybe but it puts it all kind of

01:36:28,580 --> 01:36:33,530
together in an easy-to-use visual and

01:36:31,850 --> 01:36:36,770
then the call to action you know let's

01:36:33,530 --> 01:36:39,110
work on being more and more diverse and

01:36:36,770 --> 01:36:40,640
inclusive of others something that we

01:36:39,110 --> 01:36:43,360
all can help with it's something that

01:36:40,640 --> 01:36:45,950
all of our organizations can help with

01:36:43,360 --> 01:36:49,070
let's start removing the use of

01:36:45,950 --> 01:36:51,140
deprecated code and let's start removing

01:36:49,070 --> 01:36:53,660
it now because we get to benefit from

01:36:51,140 --> 01:36:55,940
that now the benefit doesn't come with

01:36:53,660 --> 01:36:57,830
Drupal 9 the benefit comes today because

01:36:55,940 --> 01:37:02,030
you're using better more modern api's

01:36:57,830 --> 01:37:04,790
today and last let's try and refocus on

01:37:02,030 --> 01:37:06,770
the automated upgrades problem I think

01:37:04,790 --> 01:37:08,480
we've done a great job across the boards

01:37:06,770 --> 01:37:11,090
all of these strikes amazing progress

01:37:08,480 --> 01:37:12,980
and I wish we could really make a little

01:37:11,090 --> 01:37:16,610
bit more progress on the automated

01:37:12,980 --> 01:37:19,130
upgrade prog problem and I think we can

01:37:16,610 --> 01:37:21,470
and so let's try and do that make it a

01:37:19,130 --> 01:37:24,410
focus the next six months between now

01:37:21,470 --> 01:37:29,800
and Drupal con Amsterdam so with that

01:37:24,410 --> 01:37:29,800
