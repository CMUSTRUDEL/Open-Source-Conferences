00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,920

you know me and

00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:40,879
matic workshop the two

00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:44,000
tutors or teachers uh for this workshop

00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:47,600
are frederick waters and myself

00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,640
um this workshop will be about

00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:53,199
personalization as so how do you change

00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,640
the content of your website or at least

00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:56,840
like some of the

00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,000
the things on your website on the drupal

00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:01,039
website

00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,559
in combination with specific contexts

00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:04,400
it could be that the context is a

00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:05,439
country it could be that the context is

00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,439
a campaign

00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:09,600
um so that's what we're going to do here

00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:11,119
with open technologies or open source

00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,119
technologies like apaches

00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:15,119
you know me and then also we're going to

00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:17,200
connect it to matic

00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:18,880
in this workshop matic is a marketing

00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:22,320
automation open source

00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:26,000
software which allows you to convert

00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:27,600
or to capture the leads for your website

00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,439
and then actually get them into an

00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:32,159
engaging

00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:33,040
marketing automation flow if you've

00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,200
never heard of

00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,799
any of the two technologies um that's

00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,520
fine the only thing we will

00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,159
require you in this workshop um is to

00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,960
have

00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:43,920
a local drupal site even if you don't

00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,720
have any setup

00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,880
or any of that kind that's totally fine

00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:51,280
we're using very very minimal

00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,640
requirements and so hopefully everyone

00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,439
is able to follow

00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,479
as we go if you're not able to follow

00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:59,520
please please

00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:01,280
add something in the chat felik and

00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:04,719
myself are here to help

00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:07,360
um so we can actually help you

00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:08,879
either like in the chats or we can also

00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,959
allow you to share your screen so you

00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:13,680
can actually help everybody else

00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:14,720
i hope people are able to share their

00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,920
screen

00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:20,239
asking for the screen share if not

00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:22,160
maybe erin is that a possibility that

00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:24,560
you can enable

00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:26,400
but that i'm not entirely sure how that

00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:29,440
could work

00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,720
worst case i'll show everything on my

00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:33,760
computer as well

00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:37,200
on how to follow so that's

00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:39,840
a bit of the intro so far so good

00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:41,440
so then let's get started and get some

00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,400
context and so

00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,720
what is personalization personalization

00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,840
is

00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,879
the actual understanding that the global

00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:52,000
market

00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:52,720
as in the globalization of the digital

00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,080
world

00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,160
and doesn't necessarily mean that

00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,800
there's only one audience i'm making one

00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,920
website

00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,440
for the whole world to see that doesn't

00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:04,720
really

00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:06,959
like stroke with the reality people

00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,920
in the u.s or even in different states

00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:09,360
of the us

00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,720
could be very different or could

00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,680
perceive your information very

00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,480
differently

00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,040
than people from countries within europe

00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,000
or

00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:19,040
anywhere else then the question is okay

00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,560
once you start to do this

00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,280
personalization how do you measure that

00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,319
success

00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,680
um i won't go very deep into that topic

00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:26,799
if you want to know more about that in

00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,280
the beginning of the week

00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:30,000
uh monday there was a session from my

00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,239
colleague

00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,120
and that goes deeper into the marketing

00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:35,440
details of

00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:38,319
why personalization and what exactly do

00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:41,360
you want to achieve with personalization

00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:43,519
um i'll do a very short demo

00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,400
um and then we actually go into the

00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:46,959
do-it-yourself

00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,840
workshop okay and we have some more

00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:49,840
closing

00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,400
words maybe into advanced topics

00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:55,680
dependent or depending on how much time

00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:58,480
we have left um

00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:00,080
if you're following so far please leave

00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:02,959
something in the chat so i know

00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,519
that you're active and that i know that

00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:05,840
um

00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:07,280
you're you're happy to follow along uh

00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:10,080
with this workshop

00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,920
okay um it's always a bit weird when

00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:15,599
you're not seeing faces

00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:18,720
in something like this but okay

00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:21,040
let's take a look um at a little video

00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,840
and this video is is a product page from

00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,840
our company

00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,880
um but this is just a product that we've

00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,919
built um

00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:29,680
with apache you know me um and it's more

00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:32,000
like a concept video

00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,720
so what do we actually want to achieve

00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,919
someone

00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,880
comes in from google um or any other

00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:39,680
inbound channel

00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,960
like instagram or linkedin or any other

00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:44,080
social network

00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:45,759
um this person finds your website

00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:48,240
and actually comes on this website this

00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:50,880
person is anonymous this is cached by

00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,240
cloudflare or varnish or any anything

00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,880
else

00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,520
and perfect and this person is taking a

00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,600
look

00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,120
and you can see at the bottom um that

00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,280
the customer did a platform

00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,639
in this case you know me is already

00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,800
capturing all these events

00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,639
and so that's exactly what this is about

00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,840
it's actually capturing all the clicks

00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:11,680
all the movements on the site very very

00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:15,120
similar to what google analytics

00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:17,360
is doing with the key difference is that

00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,320
google analytics is free but it's not

00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,360
your data

00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:23,759
you're actually yeah paying with the

00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,520
data of your own customers

00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:26,800
by making google analytics smarter but

00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:29,919
you're not able to really use

00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,639
all of that data in a way that you

00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:33,680
actually

00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:35,680
want to maybe use it in any case this

00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,880
customer to the platform but you know me

00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,039
detected this is an

00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,639
explorer um the person goes to the

00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:43,199
website and fills in

00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:44,080
um yeah her details and that was amatic

00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:47,280
form

00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:48,880
um so now we have a conversion

00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,240
we only detected that this person is

00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,039
exploring we didn't really do anything

00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,360
with it

00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:55,039
um but we did have a conversion so

00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,720
that's great we know the intention of

00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:57,600
this person and we know who the person

00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,960
is

00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:02,720
um all within the consent um

00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,639
yeah frameworks of any kind of

00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:08,880
regulation so

00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:11,759
we assume that's all complied to now

00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:14,000
you have a profile of this person um and

00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:16,639
that's exactly a customer data platform

00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,400
is for customer data and so it has

00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:21,039
profiles that's also what you know me

00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,000
has so now let's put this information to

00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:23,759
use

00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,120
we actually now when this person comes

00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,800
back on the website

00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,240
and maybe you missed it but the front

00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,400
page looks a bit different

00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,479
the block for subscribing to the

00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:35,199
workshop is on the top left

00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:36,400
um and before in the original website

00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:38,880
this wasn't there

00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,240
we know that she likes to explore so

00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,319
we're not really pushing

00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,759
e-commerce items to her we're pushing

00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:46,479
actually more information

00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:47,600
and actually more engagement towards

00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:49,360
this person

00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,440
in order to really understand okay this

00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:54,319
is where this person is on her journey

00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:55,039
and maybe ultimately she gets or becomes

00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:58,240
a fan

00:06:55,039 --> 00:07:01,599
of our product um and she

00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,479
might will she might buy items also the

00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:04,800
newsletter

00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:06,319
because we know she's an explorer we

00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:10,400
know how she came in

00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:12,720
is tailored to that exact same profile

00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:14,319
so that's what we're trying to achieve

00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:17,759
we're trying to achieve

00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:21,280
um a customer journey that is tailored

00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:22,240
to some persona it could also be a

00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,400
one-on-one

00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,160
uh journey but in this case we're trying

00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,840
to make it as a persona

00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,440
so that's more or less how such a

00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,520
journey looks like

00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:33,680
have people come in from social media go

00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,880
for a blog or a website maybe interact

00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:38,000
with a chatbot

00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:40,000
they go to a website and an email but

00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,360
this is what we have today the websites

00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,680
usually are very static

00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,479
emails are usually very static man

00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,560
people

00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:48,639
or many companies are still sending

00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:52,080
newsletters once a month

00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:53,759
but that's not really personal okay

00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,759
so what we're trying to do in in the

00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:57,120
green items of the website and the email

00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:57,840
and that's also what this workshop is

00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,800
about

00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:02,000
is let's personalize those two items to

00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:05,120
at least make

00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,240
that end user the the customer feel that

00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,599
he or she is hurt

00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:11,520
okay um it's not about um

00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:13,280
being creepy it's about actually being

00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:16,560
closer to a person

00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:20,479
um and then go further

00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:23,039
so to recap and this person was sophia

00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:25,199
we went into an acquisition stage so

00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:28,000
maybe we have utm parameters

00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:29,759
that came into the query url um then we

00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,640
have activation

00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,440
because she or clicked somewhere we have

00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,320
conversion

00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,719
she actually entered her email address

00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,560
um

00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:40,800
and now we have nurturing because we're

00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:44,880
having a journey with this person

00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:46,800
based on email addresses okay so

00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,320
this could be for just one persona but

00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,560
we have many more um

00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:53,040
if you want to know more about that um

00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:57,360
i'll refer back to the presentation of

00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:59,760
lane um you know me

00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,880
you're actually gathering lots of events

00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:04,399
and lots of

00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:05,279
maybe sessions and profiles but it also

00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:08,640
allows you to do

00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:11,360
data analysis um on

00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,640
on this data to really get patent

00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:16,080
recognition

00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:19,760
in to that customer data platform

00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,880
so um i won't do or talk too much about

00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,200
that this is something

00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:24,880
that's actually specific to our company

00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,440
um so that's out of scope for

00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:29,120
this workshop but adding ai to something

00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,519
like a customer that platform it sounds

00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,760
cool

00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:37,040
right it actually is also pretty cool um

00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:38,399
now next step also very short um how to

00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:41,200
measure personalization

00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:42,320
you could put it all in in google sheet

00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,839
or in excel

00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,440
but it doesn't take anything into

00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:47,839
account of this

00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,920
person like this sophia doesn't really

00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:50,640
reflect here no personas are reflecting

00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,640
here

00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,000
so you don't really know how your

00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,920
website or your brand is actually

00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,399
reflecting with those personas so we

00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,720
have to

00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:00,080
add like another metric or another

00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,720
dimension

00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:04,320
um the same is valid for hot jar very

00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:07,440
interesting to understand where

00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:09,120
everybody clicks but as i told you

00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,959
before it's not about everybody

00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,240
it's about all these personas so also

00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:14,880
here we have to add

00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,839
specific dimensions and in the words of

00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:20,720
you know me

00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:23,680
let's talk about uh segments okay

00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:25,120
also in google analytics same problem

00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:27,120
google analytics

00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,959
like things everybody is exactly the

00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,079
same you have these conversions and you

00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:32,720
have these goals

00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:33,360
um but we are missing these dimensions

00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,560
or these

00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,839
segments so what can you do as soon as

00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,440
you can couple you know me

00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:41,680
or the segments that actually come back

00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,040
from you know me with google analytics

00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,720
you can add dimensions to google

00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:47,600
analytics and then understand

00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:49,200
what is the conversion ratio of this

00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,440
specific segment

00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:53,920
uh which you create that for example

00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,839
this sofia was an explorer segment

00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,760
and and then you can try to tweak and

00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:00,720
optimize your personalization

00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:01,760
based on these conversion ratios what

00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,160
happened before

00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:06,079
in other personalization softwares is

00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,440
okay you put an image here and if

00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:09,600
someone clicks on the image

00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,040
or maybe then makes a purchase yeah then

00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,040
the image is successful

00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,160
well it doesn't really work in that

00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,800
literal way

00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:18,399
um so i really prefer to take a look at

00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,480
the actual goals

00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:22,240
that you defined for your website in

00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:25,200
google analytics or in software

00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:26,000
like matamo or any other metric tool

00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,839
that you have

00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,680
and then add those personas those

00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:30,000
dimensions or segments those three words

00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,680
are

00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,360
exactly the same at least in this

00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:36,720
context um

00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:39,200
to measure those uh successes

00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,320
now i'm just going to show you a very

00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,440
quick demo

00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:47,440
um on um

00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:50,639
what this looks like okay so

00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:54,079
if um let me open up

00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:56,639
yeah this page here we have

00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:57,120
just a test page of the drop solid site

00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:59,120
um

00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:01,040
and you can see and it's in dutch but

00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:03,200
i'll explain doesn't really matter

00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:05,760
it says come and work at drop solid and

00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:08,000
stay in the comfort of your own house

00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:11,839
now let's take a look how that looks

00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,839
like if i go in incognito

00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,680
and accept all the cookies

00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:28,720
and let's refresh

00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:31,360
okay yeah took a little while but um

00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,880
it's normally you go into a website you

00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,040
make like a little journey and

00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:37,519
you visit some pages uh but here the

00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:40,079
customer platform actually detects it

00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:42,000
that i'm based in ghent so now actually

00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:43,120
it says come and work in our office in

00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,760
ghent

00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:47,680
you can see how this is different from

00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:49,200
this context which actually says come

00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,880
and work at drop zone and stay in the

00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:54,959
comfort of your own house

00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:56,959
now i'm going to just show you

00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:59,040
what the difference is you can see this

00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:02,959
is common work on our office

00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:04,560
this is common work remotely

00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:06,320
the only thing i'm doing here is i'm

00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:08,480
switching context

00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,639
from the you know me module and then

00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:13,760
based on that the drupal site actually

00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:15,279
behaves very differently in the workshop

00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,320
that's exactly what we're going to do

00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:18,480
we're going to

00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,680
go into drupal we're going to create

00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,959
some content

00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:23,920
and we're only going to show that

00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:26,160
content based on specific properties of

00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:28,560
the end visitor

00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:31,200
why is this so complex so you could say

00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:33,680
i'm able to do this with rules or with

00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:35,120
anything within drupal itself well

00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:38,399
that's true

00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:41,360
but it's also not true the the

00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:43,680
problem space is um that if you're

00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,560
actually in a global market you more

00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:47,760
like you most

00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:50,399
likely will use something like caching

00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,800
either use a varnish caching either you

00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:54,079
use

00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:57,120
cloudflare maybe akamai anything else

00:13:54,079 --> 00:14:00,720
and and then you won't even touch drupal

00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:02,800
because the url and the context is

00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:06,160
always the same and so

00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:08,240
in this case we made sure that drupal

00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,639
understands uh the context from you know

00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,760
me

00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:14,959
changed because segments came in um

00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:17,040
so then i also have to react differently

00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:18,720
this will become a lot more clear in the

00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:21,920
workshop itself

00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,320
um what we're going to do is um we have

00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,959
the

00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,680
umami website and we're going to add

00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:27,360
some blocks

00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:30,000
here and there and make sure that either

00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:33,440
they appear or disappear

00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:37,120
based on specific context

00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:39,519
so far so good everybody still following

00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,519
along

00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:49,920
i was in the crowd so it's good yeah

00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:52,079
yeah i see like almost 40 people

00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:53,199
following and and lots of yeses so that

00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:56,240
that's good

00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:59,600
okay so

00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:02,079
that was a very very short demo um

00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,720
i have sessions with lots of like longer

00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:05,360
demos

00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:07,680
um but i wanted you to have the the feel

00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:10,320
of this stuff yes so that's the key

00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:11,360
uh part of this presentation or this

00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:14,000
workshop

00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,800
so what we did is we captured online

00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,079
behavior

00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:19,040
you saw that we discovered intent and it

00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:21,360
was a very

00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,399
basic intention or maybe the very basic

00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:25,040
segment was

00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:27,839
are you in ghent or not in ghent and now

00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:30,320
we personalize the website

00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:31,600
now what is apache you know me what do

00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:34,720
you know me is an open source

00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:36,240
customer data platform and it's

00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:39,680
pronounced as you know me

00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:41,040
it's kind of like a word joke and it's a

00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:44,240
java software

00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:45,040
which was promoted to um like a main

00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,600
project

00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,240
at the apache foundation coming from a

00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,920
company

00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,000
or the main sponsorship actually came

00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:55,279
from a company called jahaya

00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,600
jahaya is a dxp company um

00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:59,040
digital experience platform company but

00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:03,360
mainly java based

00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:06,720
so they yeah yes indeed michael

00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:09,040
it's a funny joker you know me um

00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,759
but they spent a lot of effort in making

00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:12,480
this open

00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:13,279
and which is great uh the only tricky

00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,920
part

00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:16,720
is that this is a fully headless cdp

00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:20,000
which means

00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:21,680
there is no interface at all uh similar

00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,160
like apache solar

00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:26,160
it's really really hard to actually make

00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:28,160
it successful within drupal because

00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:29,920
there is no interface to make segments

00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,959
there's nothing at all it's just a rest

00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:33,680
interface

00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:34,320
but it has consent management so you can

00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,880
store

00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:38,880
if someone actually said yes to your

00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:40,160
cookies or no to your cookies or even to

00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:43,600
the categories

00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:43,600
but it requires quite some work

00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:48,320
and then we have this image again so

00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:50,480
after we've done all of that

00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:52,480
we now have website personalization but

00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:54,320
we can also actually send those segments

00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,600
from you know me into our marketing

00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,759
automation funnel

00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,920
so that we know in the emails ah this

00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:00,480
person maybe is from ghent or this

00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:04,000
person

00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:05,760
is um looking for flower pieces like you

00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,799
can go really far

00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:11,679
okay so let's

00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:12,400
go to the workshop um can you share

00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:15,439
maybe the

00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:18,799
link to the slides um

00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:20,959
what i've done is or what we've done

00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:22,240
is that we divided this in in five

00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:25,439
simple steps

00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:28,400
okay um those of you that want to

00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:28,400
follow those steps

00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:32,799
i'll answer the q a questions in a bit

00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:36,080
let's go to the workshop

00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:38,559
first um but the

00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,919
i'll keep the track of the questions

00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:42,320
yeah

00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:43,039
that's good that's great so go to the

00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:46,480
documents

00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:49,760
um go to this slide slide 26

00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:53,679
um and then let's follow along together

00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:54,720
okay i see lots of people already in the

00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:57,919
slides

00:17:54,720 --> 00:18:00,960
um what i've done is um

00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:03,039
i'm using the built-in drupal server

00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,000
or the the server capability within

00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:06,400
drupal core

00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,160
to actually start up a project and so if

00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:11,360
you follow these commands

00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:15,360
you should be able to see this

00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:18,799
you know me or this is complex umami

00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:22,240
websites with the modules

00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:24,400
already um in the code base they won't

00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:27,840
be enabled yet

00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:31,120
um i'm going to wait a little bit

00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:33,440
until um at least like 10 people maybe

00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:36,080
15 people

00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:38,799
are ready and please let us also know

00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,799
when you're ready

00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:46,080
if everything works fine you

00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:48,080
paste the commands into your terminal

00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,679
and it should work right away the only

00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:51,520
requirement is that you have php

00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:53,760
yeah you should just have php and

00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:55,760
composer um

00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:57,360
ideally composer 2 because that will be

00:18:55,760 --> 00:19:01,600
a lot quicker

00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:01,600
but it it should work with composer one

00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:12,240
maybe in the meantime mikhail

00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:14,160
i think that's your first name uh sorry

00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:16,400
if that's your last name

00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:18,720
um you have a question about does your

00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,880
inomi module support tokens

00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,799
and is there a google tag manager for

00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:25,200
the you know me tag

00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:26,960
can you maybe explain me a bit what

00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,600
you're looking for when you're asking

00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,799
for

00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,799
the token support

00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,919
and also maybe in in the meantime i'm

00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,559
going to explain you a bit how this

00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:44,000
workshop

00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:46,000
works in terms of the technology um

00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,280
we've set up a managed you know me on

00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
our end um

00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,640
which has authentication that we took

00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,480
care of

00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:54,720
that's part of the service that drop

00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:57,039
solid does but it's a plane you know me

00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,320
so there's nothing that you will

00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:01,919
interact with

00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:03,919
that is not really you know me itself um

00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:06,320
the the other thing that we've set up is

00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:07,280
a managed matic but that's also plain

00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:10,000
matic

00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:11,840
the only thing that is a bit specific to

00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,760
what drop solid provides is the tracking

00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:15,360
script

00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:17,280
because it's a bit easier to get started

00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:19,039
with our tracking script

00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:21,280
but also you know me itself comes with a

00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:24,159
very basic tracking script

00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:27,919
so it's it's not really a deal breaker

00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:27,919
if you want to really do this yourself

00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:32,840
in the google analytics module there is

00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:35,840
the ability sent profile data with

00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:35,840
tokens

00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:42,559
um so

00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:44,799
if you expose them like from within

00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:46,240
uh drupal towards your javascript then

00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:48,159
you're able to send them

00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,679
from within the javascript context to

00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:52,240
you know me you know me as a

00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:53,840
client-side tracking application similar

00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:56,000
to google analytics so

00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,960
if this works with google analytics then

00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,919
yes it

00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:01,200
should work with you know me um the only

00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:03,360
tricky part

00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,320
is you have to still write the

00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:06,880
integration

00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:08,400
to make sure that these profile datas

00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:10,880
from within drupal

00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,400
actually get to the right profile fields

00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:15,200
in you know me

00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:15,679
um i left the section all the way at the

00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:19,200
end

00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:20,960
for advanced so if people want to talk

00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,400
after this session about these advanced

00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:25,520
cases i'm very happy to

00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:27,440
to dig in and

00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:31,840
help you a bit in understanding how this

00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:31,840
works okay

00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:46,880
if anyone already has any kind of

00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,880
problem let us know

00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:51,919
usually now i will walk around look at

00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:55,280
your screen

00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:58,080
but you know yeah and i don't see much

00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:59,919
people uh

00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:01,280
you can select the text from the slides

00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:03,360
if you want it's easier you don't have

00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:05,039
to type it

00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:13,840
i think because it's read only you won't

00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:13,840
see it

00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:23,440
you can follow these steps later um this

00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:26,480
this will keep working

00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:27,440
the only tricky part uh kiss is that i i

00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,440
don't know when i

00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:31,120
i'm allowed to shut down the managed you

00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:33,120
know me um because i

00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:34,640
if i would like also have steps to set

00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:40,400
up you know me in this session

00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:42,480
this won't be finished in an hour

00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,720
need to get some inside information you

00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:46,320
know me is a java application and it has

00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:50,159
an elasticsearch database

00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:50,159
as a storage backend

00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:58,400
okay so

00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:00,080
feel free if you're already ready to go

00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,600
to the next step so you have access to

00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,080
the presentation so you don't have to

00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:06,840
wait

00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:09,840
uh for us um but what we'll do now

00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,840
um

00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:14,559
well if you have umami somewhere in a

00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:18,799
container like a very basic drupal

00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:18,799
indeed sure you can do so

00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:23,440
like this stuff these four modules it's

00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:26,000
the only thing

00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:28,000
we will we're going to do with drupal

00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,640
we're not going to touch any other codes

00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,000
or any other things we're not creating

00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:36,400
custom codes

00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:40,960
um that's as far as we're gonna go

00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:46,400
okay uh yes there is a you know me

00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:46,400
container somewhere it's out there

00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:55,919
i think i even have it on my kit yeah

00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:58,960
okay now i'm going to go to step two

00:23:55,919 --> 00:24:00,799
uh but just like chat with us

00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:02,320
if um you're not able to follow or if

00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:04,159
you have any questions okay

00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:05,840
it's kind of tricky for me to see how

00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:07,039
far you're at

00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:08,880
but we're going to uninstall the

00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:12,000
internal page cache module

00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:12,559
now why are we going to do this um is

00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,000
because

00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:16,799
the you know module won't work or won't

00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,000
have the cache

00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:21,520
context available to it with the

00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,880
internal page cache module

00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:26,480
now why is that it's because um

00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,559
the the tracking script that we're going

00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:30,159
to use in a bit from the managed you

00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:32,480
know me of drop solids

00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:33,840
places a cookie the cookie has the

00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:36,400
segment names in it

00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:38,400
and um if we want drupal to pick up the

00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,919
cookie as a cache context

00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,600
we have to disable the internal page

00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:45,200
cache module

00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:46,559
and enable the dynamic page cache module

00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,240
running you know me behind varnish is

00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:49,840
not problematic but

00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,440
enabling internal page cache is

00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:55,360
problematic because then the cush

00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:57,679
cookie cache context won't be um

00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:58,720
parsed and so that's what we're going to

00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:02,960
do

00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:05,120
so let's take a look here so internal

00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:07,279
page cache uninstall you can leave the

00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:08,480
dynamic page cache on it that's totally

00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:12,080
fine

00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:12,080
big pipe works that's all fine

00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:17,039
the internal page cache basically is

00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:19,200
like a mini varnish

00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:20,559
in drupal itself it caches pages based

00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:23,600
on the url

00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:25,760
um and that's not what we want we want

00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,400
to have dynamic pages based on specific

00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:30,480
contexts

00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:32,559
so that's why we have to disable it um

00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:34,320
if we then continue um we're going to

00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:36,960
enable drop slope personalization

00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:38,640
multi-paragraph and asset injector now

00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:41,360
this drop solid personalization

00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:42,880
is just a plug-in on top of the you know

00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:48,159
me module

00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:48,159
and so if you go to extend to this list

00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:51,679
you will see that you have the you know

00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:53,679
me module

00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:55,600
which is a very basic you know module

00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:58,240
that then

00:25:55,600 --> 00:26:00,240
works on a local you know me for this

00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:01,760
workshop we're going to use the dropsold

00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,120
personalization module

00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:05,039
because we actually set up for this

00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:07,679
workshop and managed to know me with

00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:09,360
a different kind of authentication okay

00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:11,840
so

00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:12,880
enable the drop solid personalization

00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,799
integration

00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:16,320
but i'm also going to enable the multi

00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:19,120
paragraph

00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:20,640
um what i'm also going to enable is the

00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:22,480
asset injector

00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:23,679
this is purely for the workshop this

00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:26,960
acid injector

00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:29,039
normally in production uh

00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:30,880
websites people use something like

00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:33,279
google tag manager

00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:34,000
um but because i didn't want you to set

00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:35,840
up

00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,360
all kind of separate google tag managers

00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:40,240
we're just going to inject

00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:41,600
the javascript to the head section

00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:46,400
within drupal itself

00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:48,880
okay the cookies

00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:50,720
there's an issue in the udomi module to

00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:53,360
customize the cookie name

00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,840
and in most cases for example on acquia

00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:57,520
or

00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:59,679
um on the job solid platform

00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:01,840
i think also on the amazing platform

00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:05,440
there is a specific cookie name

00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:08,480
that allows uh that varnish to vary on

00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:10,080
so for example uh at the drop solid

00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:12,960
hosting platform this is called ds

00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:16,080
underscore very underscore something

00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:21,840
um i'm pretty sure panxion and and

00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:21,840
fastly have something similar as well

00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:25,360
i don't know all of the interest

00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:26,159
interesting details of all these hosting

00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:28,480
platforms

00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:28,480
um

00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:37,520
okay so let's enable that

00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:41,279
while we wait um

00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:44,320
we are almost at step three

00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:47,120
still see 40 people following so i'm

00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:47,600
assuming that you're all still chugging

00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:52,159
along

00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:55,360
okay so now add our tracking scripts

00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:56,159
um there is a instruction here where you

00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:58,559
can actually

00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:59,919
log in to the drop site platform to find

00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:02,080
the tracking script

00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:04,159
but just to make it easier for everybody

00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,720
i don't like require you to have an

00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:07,919
account

00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:09,440
at our platform i'm just going to show

00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:12,559
you how that looks like

00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:14,240
and so we have a ui

00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:15,760
that then has the tracking script that

00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:18,799
you can download

00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:22,000
with or like inject and it has the

00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:24,559
specific uuid um but

00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,080
in this case the tracking script is also

00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:29,120
available here

00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:33,120
if you have a local you know me i'm

00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:33,120
just going to show you the manual

00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:38,240
this is the manual of you know me it's

00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:42,840
massively long

00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:47,360
um and let me see

00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:47,360
where i have it here

00:28:53,440 --> 00:29:00,720
somewhere in this massive documentation

00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:03,039
um there is actually like a

00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:05,440
script that comes with the you know me

00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:05,440
itself

00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:09,760
yeah i don't know by heart where it

00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:11,760
exactly is but it's some

00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:13,360
somewhere out there the the best thing

00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:15,039
is if you run this locally

00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:16,960
that you take a look at their sample

00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:17,600
script and actually make it a bit your

00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,679
own

00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,880
because usually you want to add some

00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:23,120
default uh

00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:25,360
parameters into the customer data

00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:27,279
platform

00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:29,120
the you know module doesn't manage it

00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:32,799
doesn't manages this tracking script

00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:35,840
um because this is very very

00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:37,279
like specific to the exact solution that

00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:40,240
you're trying to build

00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:41,760
um and in google analytics obviously

00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:44,720
this is managed by google

00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:46,320
but in this case yeah it really depends

00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:49,200
on what you're actually trying to

00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:50,799
to track the drop solid tracking script

00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,760
like tracks a whole bunch of things by

00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:54,960
default

00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:55,520
um and i'll show you that once it's in

00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,600
there

00:29:55,520 --> 00:30:00,559
so you can see what it actually tracks

00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:02,960
um and what it actually sends

00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:04,240
the the data structure of you know me

00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:07,840
works

00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:10,000
in three layers we have events we have

00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:12,399
sessions and there's profiles

00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,480
everything always starts with an event

00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:15,279
an event is linked to a session so then

00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,200
the aggregate

00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:18,720
comes to the session and then the

00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:21,520
aggregate of all the sessions

00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:22,159
or the last value depending on what

00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,840
specific

00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:25,360
logic you're having you know me goes

00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:27,600
into the profile

00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,600
okay

00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:33,600
maybe to just give you also like a ui

00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,399
view of what then

00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:38,720
would be in you know me and if some of

00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:42,080
you have already the script

00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:43,279
enabled we will see that someone from

00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:46,399
toronto

00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:49,600
already has this script enabled

00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:52,720
um let's see

00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,720
where this person is

00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:05,360
a bit i'm not entirely sure

00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:08,640
if the person is visible

00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:10,880
here but in any case

00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:12,159
it could be visible dependent on what

00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:15,039
you allow

00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:16,480
um but here you can see like what is

00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:18,000
actually being visited

00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:21,039
and then this is the profiles we can

00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,880
also just see the events

00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:24,480
what you're seeing here is purely a ui

00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:26,080
interface but we're

00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:27,679
going straight to the elasticsearch of

00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:31,200
you know me

00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:34,320
so you can see there's some people here

00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:34,960
that visit the the websites where they

00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:39,120
clicked on

00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:39,120
etc etc but there's a lot more

00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:46,799
okay once you have that script

00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:48,559
you can add it in the js injector

00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:49,919
and now we're just mimicking the google

00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:51,760
tag manager uh

00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:54,240
functionality yeah so this is really for

00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:57,600
the workshop don't do this in production

00:31:54,240 --> 00:32:00,640
this is bad bad practice

00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:03,519
um we have um

00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:04,720
a platform a sas platform michael um

00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:06,799
that has a ui

00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:09,120
to look into you know me and also to

00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:11,039
create the segments with the ui

00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:13,760
um i know that there's also an open

00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:16,799
source python i think it's a python

00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:18,080
application out there which is a local

00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:20,880
application that also

00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:22,080
is able to look into you know me itself

00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:25,279
um

00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:27,600
this yeah open source community

00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:29,120
is actually only starting out and lots

00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:32,960
of things are actually happening

00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:34,559
really really fast um drop solid shoes

00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:36,159
like chose to actually have the

00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:39,760
interface

00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:41,840
on our website to make it easy but maybe

00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:43,279
depends on how how far we actually get

00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:44,799
with the module

00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:47,679
it could be that like the basic

00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:50,480
functionality also gets into drupal

00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:52,240
um also may be interesting for the

00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:54,480
people here in the session to know

00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:55,440
there is um there was a google summer of

00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:57,519
codes applicants

00:32:55,440 --> 00:33:00,320
that wanted to work on the unomi module

00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:02,720
on the one that you just installed

00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:04,080
google didn't choose for drupal this

00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:06,240
year

00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:08,159
so they didn't sponsor but drop solid

00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:11,519
sets will sponsor you anyway

00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:13,600
so this person uh from india is

00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:16,000
going to work two months full time just

00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:17,679
on the unomi module right now

00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,519
we're thinking of integrating it with

00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:22,159
smart segments or smart content

00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:24,159
um but if you have any kind of remark um

00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:27,600
just please leave it in the issue queue

00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:31,200
um it's going to be very very active um

00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:34,799
yeah in the next coming two months

00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:38,960
okay so if you

00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:39,519
are here and please follow all these

00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:41,760
steps

00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:42,559
uh we're going to add the script into

00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:46,000
the

00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:49,519
injector and here we're going to do um

00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,519
something special as well

00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,519
again if you're not following please

00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:55,279
please let us know

00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:56,880
i'm very very happy to take a couple

00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:58,159
steps back if you're not following

00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:01,600
what's happening

00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:04,559
um but what we're doing here

00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:05,360
um is that um we're adding custom

00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:09,200
information

00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:12,960
to our customer data platform based on

00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:15,679
data within the client side information

00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:17,679
so if you're able to read some some

00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:19,839
javascript

00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:21,440
you can see that we're reading out the

00:34:19,839 --> 00:34:24,879
url and we're reading out

00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:28,639
the utm campaign and the utm source

00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:32,560
from the page so please also add this

00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:35,760
into your asset injector

00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:40,320
okay and in that way and let me

00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:49,839
also do all of those steps for you

00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:49,839
so let's do this then

00:34:56,879 --> 00:35:02,640
i'm going to put them all in in a single

00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:05,920
one just for uh

00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:05,920
sake of simplicity

00:35:14,839 --> 00:35:19,440
okay

00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:22,240
that doesn't really matter much um but

00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:22,240
i'll save it

00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:26,800
okay if i now go back to my site

00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:34,880
maybe i'll um take over

00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,880
easier

00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:39,920
okay

00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:44,560
so now we have the websites let's take a

00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:48,400
look what what happens

00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:50,240
in our network tab okay so i clicked on

00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:52,720
give it a go and grow your own herbs or

00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:54,560
i'm selecting this

00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:56,880
and you can see that the request

00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:58,720
actually goes into

00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:00,320
apache you know me on the manage apache

00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:02,560
you know me and

00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:03,839
if you go to the preview tab this might

00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:06,640
be a bit small

00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:07,920
you can see what actually comes back the

00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:10,960
response here

00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:12,320
is the exact response of what apache you

00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:14,079
know me would send back when you're

00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:17,280
sending an event

00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:19,359
so um you can see

00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:21,359
there's consent management you can see

00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:23,760
that the consent was granted

00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:25,599
we have profile properties and this gets

00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:28,240
interesting now

00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:30,480
um is this big enough for people to to

00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:34,640
read

00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:37,040
okay so we can see the last session

00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:38,880
started yeah a minute ago i mean

00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:40,640
incognito so that's normal it's a new

00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:42,800
profile

00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:43,839
the first visit was here and then the

00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:47,200
last visit

00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:47,920
was at this timestamp the interesting

00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:50,640
parts

00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:51,440
i'm an incognito so somehow i think

00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:55,040
google says

00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:55,599
oh you're in switzerland um i'm against

00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:58,960
by the way

00:36:55,599 --> 00:37:00,800
so it's normal that you're seeing this

00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:02,480
this is a functionality that you can

00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:04,160
enable in apache you know me

00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:05,680
you have to look into the dark corners

00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:07,839
of the documentation

00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:09,520
but once you find out that you can add a

00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:13,040
max mind database

00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:16,160
in you know me all of this location

00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:18,320
transformation from ip to location is

00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:21,359
natively supported by genome

00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:24,640
okay so you can get lot

00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:27,040
long there's user agents and etc now

00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:28,560
um there's a couple of other interesting

00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:32,320
items that we see here

00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:32,960
so in event data and this is something

00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:35,200
that the

00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:37,040
drop solid tracking script adds which is

00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:39,520
not enabled by

00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:41,119
default or not in the open source but

00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:44,800
you could write this yourself

00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:47,520
pretty easily is that you can see that

00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:48,480
the value that i selected is actually

00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:53,119
being sent

00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:55,920
to our customer profile so now we know

00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:57,520
um that this person clicked on this we

00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:58,720
know the context where this person

00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:00,240
clicked so this is somewhat of a

00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:03,599
combination of hot jar

00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:04,880
and location information so you can see

00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:05,839
we're actually capturing all that

00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:09,440
information

00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:13,359
to then do data analysis on it either on

00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:15,680
uh location basis maybe on data analysis

00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:19,280
based on what they click on dependent on

00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:21,839
maybe it's technical maybe it's not

00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:23,119
but you can see there's a lot more that

00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:26,240
is happening here

00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:26,560
also um and this gets a bit creepy you

00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:30,000
can

00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:32,000
see the browser information but all the

00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:34,079
cookie names not the values and be

00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,440
careful not do not send cookie values

00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:38,320
along to apache you know me

00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:39,520
that goes a bit too far you can see like

00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:42,800
what's available

00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:44,160
what is my memory what's my screen size

00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:46,160
uh so you can actually build your

00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:49,440
segments that way

00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:49,440
okay so first you're good

00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:56,079
yes domatic username and login is

00:38:52,880 --> 00:39:00,800
admin slash montlick

00:38:56,079 --> 00:39:03,760
feel free to continue okay

00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:04,240
now i'm very happy that you actually get

00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:07,920
to that

00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:10,960
got to that step um you can actually

00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:14,079
now add martic so um

00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:17,599
matic is a marketing automation software

00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:20,160
and it also allows you to

00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:20,800
track just page views but then also have

00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:23,599
forms

00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:25,760
and have automated email flows and etc

00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:27,680
etc it's a session on its own

00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:29,760
but what we're going to do is we're

00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:30,480
going to add the tracking script of

00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:34,800
maltik

00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:34,800
the managemotic that we have set up

00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:39,040
let's see here

00:39:40,839 --> 00:39:47,520
injector magic

00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,520
okay

00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:57,040
so now we're tracking um things in

00:39:51,359 --> 00:40:02,560
matic okay let me refresh

00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:02,560
and let's go to the matic application

00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:13,359
i'm not entirely sure how the matic will

00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:15,760
like

00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:17,200
behave if 30 people will log in at the

00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:21,119
same time

00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:23,440
um but if we take a look here

00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:24,480
we can see that there's already like

00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:27,680
some people that

00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:29,839
um have the matic script enabled and we

00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:33,839
have someone from this ip

00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:35,680
174 that actually

00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:37,440
clicked on home drupal and a couple of

00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:40,480
times

00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:42,079
and then also from this ip

00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:44,400
which give it to go and grow your own

00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:45,520
herbs some pages so there's a couple

00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:50,319
people already

00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:50,319
in our marketing automation database

00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:54,560
obviously we don't know who this person

00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:58,319
is so

00:40:54,560 --> 00:41:01,599
um let's try to change that if we

00:40:58,319 --> 00:41:02,240
then go further now we have all the

00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:05,680
scripts

00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:08,640
uh enabled let's try to

00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:09,520
have the matic and the you know me

00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:13,119
configured

00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:16,400
so um i'm going to

00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:19,839
or maybe frederick for the sake of

00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:21,520
time can you maybe share the client id

00:41:19,839 --> 00:41:25,359
and

00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:27,680
secret from the matic application in the

00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:27,680
chat

00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:36,319
okay i'm taking your

00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:37,520
and why we're going to configure martik

00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:39,599
and drupal

00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:41,440
is that then we actually can get the

00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:44,800
forms that are created in matic

00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:47,599
in drupal now what are forms

00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:49,359
forms are here in the components we see

00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:50,079
there is like a newsletter subscription

00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:52,640
form

00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:54,079
very very similar to uh like a mailchimp

00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:56,560
form or web form

00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:57,920
just to ask an email address uh from a

00:41:56,560 --> 00:42:03,839
specific person

00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:08,880
okay so let's take a look at matic

00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:08,880
okay and i'm going to fill this in

00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:20,720
delete this empty a lot

00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,720
okay

00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:26,800
you can actually also go from web form

00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:29,440
to matic um i'm not entirely sure

00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:30,000
that integration works out of the box

00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:33,440
but it's not

00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:36,400
that interesting because

00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:38,800
your content editor or maybe the the

00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:41,839
marketeer needs to be in full control

00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:45,280
the tricky part about web form and

00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:47,200
mainly in a multilingual environment

00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:49,119
it's a lot easier for the marketeer to

00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:51,200
have full control within matic about

00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:53,440
their funnels and about their inbound

00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:54,480
traffic and then just enable these or

00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:57,760
embed these forms

00:42:54,480 --> 00:43:00,800
in drupal itself but it's

00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:04,240
it's okay um if you go

00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:10,000
from a web form to multicam

00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:10,000
so let's save this information

00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:16,960
okay so login

00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:16,960
to enable

00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:19,839
application

00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:23,760
and perfect we are connected it's okay

00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:27,599
if you use

00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:30,800
web format no problem so

00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:32,240
we're now connected and we're going to

00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:36,480
do the same with you know me

00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:38,000
okay um there's instructions here to go

00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:41,200
to our platform

00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:42,640
for the sake of time um um

00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:44,400
if you want you can leave your email

00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:47,040
address and friday juarez will give you

00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:50,800
access to the interface of you know me

00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:51,760
but you don't need to okay so nothing uh

00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:53,520
enforced

00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:55,760
but there will be a couple of segments

00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:57,680
if um you're not following

00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:59,440
this if you leave your email address

00:43:57,680 --> 00:43:59,920
we'll add you and you can actually play

00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:02,800
around

00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:03,680
in the interface that is managed by top

00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:05,119
solid

00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:07,040
just going to show you how that looks

00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:09,440
like

00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:12,079
the interface is they're like

00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:14,400
interacting directly with the unomi api

00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:15,200
and just to know there's nothing nothing

00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:17,040
special

00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:19,680
that we're doing here other than just

00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:23,280
visualizing what apache you know me

00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:26,800
is capable of doing um

00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:28,560
we added a couple of segments here

00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:29,839
and we can see here that we added

00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:31,359
properties which say

00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:33,359
there's a bunch of properties that we

00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:35,440
have and

00:44:33,359 --> 00:44:37,200
what we are configuring now is a segment

00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:40,319
that can detect

00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:42,480
if a specific campaign um

00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:44,319
was your inbound channel so imagine you

00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:46,960
came in from an instagram

00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:48,480
ads or a linkedin ads which has a query

00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:52,000
parameter utm

00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:55,760
campaign called campaign of nick and i'm

00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:59,440
going to show you how that looks like so

00:44:55,760 --> 00:45:03,359
imagine there is this

00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:07,599
recipe called super easy vegetarian

00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:10,960
pasta bake whatever in most cases

00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:14,240
if you come from facebook or linkedin um

00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:14,240
you will have something like that

00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:19,200
nick the marketeer will know okay this

00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:21,599
is how i can detect in google analytics

00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:24,640
if someone came in from those

00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:28,079
campaigns so

00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:28,960
that's what we did here um what you can

00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:30,880
also do

00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:32,000
if you have all these properties is to

00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:34,720
have segments based

00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:36,240
on the size of your screen you can have

00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:39,440
segments based on

00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:42,960
if you're on a specific domain

00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:45,839
you have segments based on specific

00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:47,359
city or a country so there's a lot of

00:45:45,839 --> 00:45:48,400
things that you then can do to create

00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:51,680
segments

00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:52,720
for this exercise we're going to just

00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:54,800
use the utm

00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:56,240
parameter and the integration that we

00:45:54,800 --> 00:46:00,160
created for that

00:45:56,240 --> 00:46:02,079
okay so we created that campaign

00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:03,520
or we created that segment and now we're

00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:06,000
going to configure

00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:07,040
the you know me application in drupal

00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:10,240
okay

00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:14,560
so let's go to the configuration

00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:18,000
very very similar as to matic

00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:20,160
let's go to you know me i choose for

00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,599
dropside platform if you have a local

00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:22,720
you know me you can choose for basic

00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:25,359
authentication

00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:27,599
because that's the non-managed you know

00:46:25,359 --> 00:46:30,640
me which you just run locally

00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:32,960
if you do drop solid platform

00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:36,240
and you follow the presentation you will

00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:38,800
see that you can fill in these

00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:38,800
values

00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:44,880
okay and then reports 443

00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:52,480
okay client id it should be secrets but

00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:58,560
they're actually in the presentation

00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:58,560
so otherwise this would be rather hard

00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:03,040
and then we click on save configuration

00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:08,960
and if all goes well he saves it and

00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:12,480
we're now connected with you know

00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:15,119
great are people still following or did

00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:17,760
i lose everybody and do i just continue

00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:18,560
hopefully people are still following and

00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:22,839
i'm able to

00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:27,680
continue uh as well

00:47:22,839 --> 00:47:27,680
okay perfect

00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:33,839
so um one thing which is a bug

00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:35,520
in the you know me module and that's uh

00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:37,359
what's being fixed on right now

00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:39,520
by the person that is doing google

00:47:37,359 --> 00:47:42,160
summer of codes we only have to

00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:43,440
clear the caches once um because

00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:46,319
otherwise

00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:47,839
you can come in this will be fixed in

00:47:46,319 --> 00:47:49,280
one of the future releases i have a

00:47:47,839 --> 00:47:52,319
small question nick

00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:56,400
sure people but

00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:58,240
i have a question drop solid marketeer

00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:59,920
which marketing role do i have to choose

00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:02,559
so i have drupal called demo as an

00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:02,559
organization

00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:07,839
you have to do this one so

00:48:10,780 --> 00:48:15,200
[Music]

00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:17,440
click on demo on here you have to add

00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:17,440
them

00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:25,680
so here ah okay okay

00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:35,040
yes so um

00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:36,960
if we then clear our caches

00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:38,800
there's no devil enabled on this website

00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:41,599
so i actually have to go to

00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:43,520
the old school way of doing things clear

00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:47,359
our caches

00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:50,960
okay and then

00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:53,200
we are at the last step what we're doing

00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:53,200
or

00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:59,280
uh maybe feel like if you can help

00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:01,280
elaine um

00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:02,640
so what we're going to do in step six is

00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:04,960
we're going to create

00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:05,760
a block which actually embeds a motif

00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:08,720
form

00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:09,440
we're only going to show it to people

00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:12,480
that came in

00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:16,640
from a specific campaign okay

00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:18,880
so um i'm going to

00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:18,880
the

00:49:20,079 --> 00:49:24,079
structure block some people like you

00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:26,559
could do this with layout builder

00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:27,920
you could do this with paragraphs um but

00:49:26,559 --> 00:49:30,960
neither of them

00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:33,200
are actually enabled here in the demo

00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:34,720
i know there's layer builder here but

00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:36,640
you still need a patch to make that

00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:38,960
conditionally visible

00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:40,079
i can talk about that more in the

00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:43,200
advanced section

00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:46,960
or maybe in a q a afterwards

00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:51,440
but right now here in the content

00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:55,119
piece we're going to add a custom block

00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:58,480
which is a multiblock and we're going to

00:49:55,119 --> 00:50:01,599
give it a title

00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:04,640
subscribe to our channel newsletter

00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:07,839
okay and description

00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:12,480
newsletter full of chili sauces and

00:50:07,839 --> 00:50:14,400
here we can actually do an autocomplete

00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:15,760
and we can find our chili newsletter

00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:19,440
subscription form

00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:20,960
okay now here we have also you know me

00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:24,800
segment selection

00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:27,440
and i want this form to only be

00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:29,040
shown to people that came in from an

00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:32,000
in-doubt campaign

00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:32,559
which was the utm parameter campaign of

00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,839
nick

00:50:32,559 --> 00:50:42,319
okay so let's save this

00:50:35,839 --> 00:50:42,319
um and then if we go back to our content

00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:47,520
and let's take a look at maybe a recipe

00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:50,559
here

00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:50,559
salsa chili

00:50:52,839 --> 00:50:56,319
okay um

00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:01,680
let me see if this actually shows

00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,839
oh now i'm in spanish

00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:14,559
do i have english ones

00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:22,079
i don't have the permission to add

00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:24,810
people it seems

00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:27,889
um okay

00:51:24,810 --> 00:51:27,889
[Music]

00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:33,839
well just follow along right now um

00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:34,720
leave your email addresses and maybe we

00:51:33,839 --> 00:51:36,880
can actually go

00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:39,200
like stay in the session for those that

00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:43,280
actually want to dig a bit deeper

00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:46,960
it's a virtual room so no normally

00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:51,280
people will stay let's take a look at

00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:55,200
our block

00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:58,480
um place block and here

00:51:55,200 --> 00:52:01,200
subscribe to our newsletter

00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:03,680
okay i actually didn't place the block

00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:07,520
but now it's here under main

00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:08,720
and we should see it in articles or

00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:12,079
anywhere else

00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:15,359
so if we refresh this page we can see

00:52:12,079 --> 00:52:18,480
we embedded now the matic form

00:52:15,359 --> 00:52:21,359
okay this doesn't look like much um

00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:24,079
but let me just show you um what is

00:52:21,359 --> 00:52:24,079
actually happening

00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:31,839
so let's go to some recipe somewhere it

00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:35,599
actually shows on all pages

00:52:31,839 --> 00:52:38,960
and we see that i'm actually

00:52:35,599 --> 00:52:43,760
seeing this newsletter now

00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:43,760
if we mimic

00:52:44,839 --> 00:52:51,280
the behavior and so

00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:54,000
imagine i actually come in

00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:56,319
from somewhere and i'm coming in from

00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:59,440
the campaign of

00:52:56,319 --> 00:53:03,119
lake um

00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:06,880
and i click on view recipe or somewhere

00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:08,400
i should i shouldn't see the form

00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:11,119
sometimes it takes like just a little

00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:11,680
snip seconds um but you can see the form

00:53:11,119 --> 00:53:15,520
actually

00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:18,880
disappeared i went a bit too quick

00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:22,079
locally but that's okay you see

00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:23,760
the form is not here how do we know

00:53:22,079 --> 00:53:28,480
if the form actually appears with the

00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:30,240
correct segment there is a helper um

00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:32,160
yeah there's a helper script or helper

00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:34,400
chrome uh extension

00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:36,160
that can give you the information about

00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:38,800
the customer data platform

00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:41,040
now let's see if we can actually make

00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:41,040
the

00:53:41,359 --> 00:53:45,280
snippet appear again so now we can play

00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:49,599
and

00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:53,839
make let's click around some articles

00:53:49,599 --> 00:53:56,079
see if we can view it um

00:53:53,839 --> 00:53:57,280
you can see the form actually appeared

00:53:56,079 --> 00:54:00,319
again

00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:02,800
all right so you're not being added to

00:54:00,319 --> 00:54:03,680
a drupal site you bring added to the

00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:05,599
platform that

00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:07,200
helps you play around with the you know

00:54:05,599 --> 00:54:10,400
module

00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:13,200
so this was a very short way

00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:14,960
of actually getting the form uh shown or

00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:16,800
not shown this is a proof of concept

00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:20,000
there so if you want to know more

00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:21,040
let me know maybe afterwards um but what

00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:23,359
i'm going to do now

00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:25,359
is i'm going to make myself known and so

00:54:23,359 --> 00:54:27,839
i fill it in

00:54:25,359 --> 00:54:29,760
it says thank you for subscribing and

00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:33,440
let's see what happens now

00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:36,720
if i go to contacts you can see that

00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:37,520
i filled in my email address and you can

00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:39,599
see

00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:40,720
all the pages that i visited and you

00:54:39,599 --> 00:54:44,000
have full matic

00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:45,599
potential full multi capability um

00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:47,760
for the people that actually wanted to

00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:49,520
show your form normally

00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:51,280
in personalization cases you're not

00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:52,079
doing this with forms you're doing this

00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:54,880
with specific

00:54:52,079 --> 00:54:57,119
titles specific images maybe specific

00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:57,920
paragraphs or specific blocks on the

00:54:57,119 --> 00:55:02,160
page

00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:06,079
this is again proof of concept for data

00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:08,319
so let's take a step

00:55:06,079 --> 00:55:08,319
back

00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:14,319
all right so we placed the block uh we

00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:17,200
configured it

00:55:14,319 --> 00:55:18,079
and we actually got the form from matic

00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:20,160
uh we

00:55:18,079 --> 00:55:21,200
made sure that it only showed two

00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:24,960
specific

00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:28,079
campaigns um and we tested it

00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:30,319
so we logged out of everything

00:55:28,079 --> 00:55:31,119
we navigated to this link we navigated

00:55:30,319 --> 00:55:34,400
to a recipe

00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:35,359
we saw the form drupal responded

00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:38,400
correctly

00:55:35,359 --> 00:55:39,599
to the cache context and showed the

00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:43,920
right

00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:46,559
rendering okay we saw also in matic

00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:48,160
that the form was filled in we saw the

00:55:46,559 --> 00:55:51,200
history of that person

00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:52,319
in matic and we can then start uh the

00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:54,799
whole bunch of

00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:56,640
journeys of marketing automation uh if

00:55:54,799 --> 00:55:59,599
you want to know more there's maticon

00:55:56,640 --> 00:56:00,880
in a couple weeks um to really get to

00:55:59,599 --> 00:56:03,200
the power of matic

00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:04,000
we connected all of these applications

00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:07,280
right now

00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:08,160
in a single hour without you really

00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:10,960
needing any

00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:11,599
proprietary system other than managed

00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:14,000
you know me

00:56:11,599 --> 00:56:15,040
and maybe managed matic but that doesn't

00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:18,240
really mean

00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:20,880
too much so

00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:21,520
um that's a bit to recap we only had an

00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:23,520
hour

00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:26,480
so i tried to cram as much as possible

00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:27,839
in that hour i apologize if it went a

00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:31,599
bit too fast

00:56:27,839 --> 00:56:34,240
um so hopefully that was useful um

00:56:31,599 --> 00:56:35,760
in the presentation and i'm happy to

00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:38,319
have some q as

00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:40,400
if if you have there's advanced cases

00:56:38,319 --> 00:56:42,799
there there's geolocation

00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:44,000
um there's cross device detection as we

00:56:42,799 --> 00:56:47,119
can actually have you know me

00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:48,720
merge profiles because you identify

00:56:47,119 --> 00:56:50,400
that the same person opened up the

00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:53,760
newsletter from matic

00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:56,400
on like on the website but also maybe

00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:57,200
filled in his email or her email address

00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:59,920
on

00:56:57,200 --> 00:57:00,960
the mobile phone or on another laptop

00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:04,079
then you know me

00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:06,880
is able to merge these profiles together

00:57:04,079 --> 00:57:08,319
and have it as a single person if you

00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:10,000
want to see a little demo about the

00:57:08,319 --> 00:57:12,160
geolocation

00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:14,000
or localization there's also a video in

00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:17,280
the presentation

00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:19,440
and in closing we now actually merge

00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:22,480
these three technologies together

00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:24,240
with all these tools um

00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:25,839
and this is a bit about drop solids if

00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:27,359
you want to know more about what we do

00:57:25,839 --> 00:57:30,480
how we can help you

00:57:27,359 --> 00:57:31,440
um in the eu drupal cons we're main

00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:34,640
sponsor

00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:37,359
in the us uh we're not that big yet but

00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:39,520
we have a lot of ambition and hopefully

00:57:37,359 --> 00:57:42,000
maybe we can help you

00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:43,680
and help us get there okay if you have

00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:47,520
any questions

00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:49,520
drop me find me at slack find me here

00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:50,559
you can certainly stay here for a little

00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:54,240
while

00:57:50,559 --> 00:57:57,920
and have a q a and otherwise um email

00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:57,920
us find us

00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:01,760
and yeah let us know

00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:10,480
okay thank you everybody

00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:12,319
i think there are a few people that are

00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:13,200
maybe interested in having an account on

00:58:12,319 --> 00:58:16,319
um

00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:19,599
on the platform sure so um

00:58:16,319 --> 00:58:21,280
maybe let me know your email address max

00:58:19,599 --> 00:58:26,160
was interested certainly and

00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:28,960
um mitchell

00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:30,480
mitchell was also interested i think uh

00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:32,400
so i think maybe let's add those and

00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:34,880
then we can

00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:36,960
make an experiment on their own time can

00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:39,200
you find the email addresses somewhere

00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:40,799
yes i have them i'll send you uh on the

00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:43,440
slack that's good for you

00:58:40,799 --> 00:58:47,200
yeah you'll get an invite um and then

00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:47,200
you're able to explore with do you know

00:58:48,839 --> 00:58:51,839
me

00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:56,960
slack is very slow i'm going to stop the

00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:56,960
screen share

00:58:58,799 --> 00:59:04,079
okay um i'll stay here for like another

00:59:02,559 --> 00:59:05,119
10 minutes if you have any other

00:59:04,079 --> 00:59:08,720
questions

00:59:05,119 --> 00:59:10,240
feel free while i'm adding

00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:19,839
the people that actually wanted to have

00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:19,839
an account

00:59:30,839 --> 00:59:35,359
um

00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:38,720
so those two should have received

00:59:35,359 --> 00:59:40,240
yeah an account elaine can you resend it

00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:42,000
to me because i have a private

00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:43,680
message of you but i didn't receive your

00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:46,400
email address

00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:48,400
um and also elaine you had a question uh

00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:50,480
how does this compare to acquia lyft

00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:51,520
um it's something that i i didn't

00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:54,160
mention um

00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:55,200
but i was uh one of the engineers at the

00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:57,920
acquia lift

00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:59,200
uh product um was my previous employer

00:59:57,920 --> 01:00:02,079
acquia

00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:03,200
um how does this compare it takes a very

01:00:02,079 --> 01:00:06,079
different approach

01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:07,280
um aquialift or at least when i was

01:00:06,079 --> 01:00:09,920
still there

01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:10,799
required that your content is

01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:13,119
synchronized

01:00:10,799 --> 01:00:15,359
to something which is called content hub

01:00:13,119 --> 01:00:19,200
or at least to an external

01:00:15,359 --> 01:00:20,319
space so that's then using ajax calls or

01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:23,280
javascript it gets

01:00:20,319 --> 01:00:23,680
injected in your sites again in this

01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:26,079
case

01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:27,359
we're making use of the power of the

01:00:26,079 --> 01:00:30,880
cache contacts

01:00:27,359 --> 01:00:32,960
of drupal itself to make sure um

01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:35,119
that the content actually stays within

01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:35,760
drupal and that's the whole ecosystem is

01:00:35,119 --> 01:00:39,599
actually a bit

01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:42,720
simpler and so aqua lift is most likely

01:00:39,599 --> 01:00:46,640
great for really big cases but if you

01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:46,640
are looking for um

01:00:47,599 --> 01:00:52,720
easier starts but with very similar

01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:54,680
functionality very similar power

01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:55,839
then you know me is a very good

01:00:54,680 --> 01:00:59,040
alternative

01:00:55,839 --> 01:01:01,359
also the you know me is open

01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:03,440
it's also open source so for governments

01:01:01,359 --> 01:01:05,040
and this is something why in europe this

01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:07,359
is a very different case

01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:09,359
it's very interesting it's not a

01:01:07,359 --> 01:01:11,200
proprietary data set

01:01:09,359 --> 01:01:12,640
it's not a proprietary system so you

01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:15,280
could set it up yourself

01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:17,440
if you really would need to for specific

01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:19,920
compliancy reasons and so

01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:20,720
um that's i think one of the key

01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:24,319
differences

01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:26,559
between those two and most likely i can

01:01:24,319 --> 01:01:27,359
uh wrestle with chris now about content

01:01:26,559 --> 01:01:30,000
hub and

01:01:27,359 --> 01:01:32,000
uh i know he was very much involved so

01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:34,319
happy to talk to you chris

01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:35,599
uh about that um but this doesn't

01:01:34,319 --> 01:01:38,079
involve anything

01:01:35,599 --> 01:01:39,359
about uh content synchronization to

01:01:38,079 --> 01:01:43,119
external sources

01:01:39,359 --> 01:01:46,000
okay this works with the gd

01:01:43,119 --> 01:01:47,280
pr not the rp i'm not sure what the rp

01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:49,520
is

01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:51,680
but i'm assuming that you are mentioning

01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:54,640
gdpr

01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:56,480
and you can take you can see um how that

01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:59,680
works on the website of drop solid

01:01:56,480 --> 01:02:01,200
okay so what we do is we have the eu

01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:07,839
cookie compliance module

01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:07,839
which is then um i need to disable

01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,720
incognito

01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:18,640
so if you go to the website of the you

01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:20,079
can see something like this which is a

01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:21,920
cookie pop-up

01:02:20,079 --> 01:02:24,160
and it doesn't load in any scripts as

01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:25,920
long as you don't give your consent

01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:27,839
so it's exactly the same as google

01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:29,119
analytics or any other tracking script

01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:29,680
you shouldn't load in the tracking

01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:32,000
script

01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:32,799
if you don't have any consent as soon as

01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,400
you store

01:02:32,799 --> 01:02:36,240
or have the consent you can actually

01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:37,599
store it in local storage or anywhere

01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:38,880
else and then send it along with the

01:02:37,599 --> 01:02:41,839
consent management

01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:42,799
so you can store um the date and time

01:02:41,839 --> 01:02:46,319
that a specific

01:02:42,799 --> 01:02:49,440
profile or person made their consent

01:02:46,319 --> 01:02:51,920
this is very important on a legal case

01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:53,680
because you need to know if someone

01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:54,640
protests that he or she didn't give

01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:57,039
consent

01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:57,760
for tracking you need to prove when and

01:02:57,039 --> 01:03:00,400
where

01:02:57,760 --> 01:03:00,960
uh he or she actually did so and in many

01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:03,760
cases

01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:05,359
or in many cookie compliancy solutions

01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:08,319
or certainly with basic eu

01:03:05,359 --> 01:03:09,520
compliance or other banners um this is

01:03:08,319 --> 01:03:11,280
not the case so

01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:13,359
if you want to be gdpr compliance

01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:16,079
actually having a

01:03:13,359 --> 01:03:17,359
like a customer data platform is

01:03:16,079 --> 01:03:21,039
actually a benefit

01:03:17,359 --> 01:03:22,559
instead of a negative downside

01:03:21,039 --> 01:03:24,160
you don't need to personalize that you

01:03:22,559 --> 01:03:30,000
don't need to collect the information

01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:32,799
but consent management is important

01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:33,680
um you know me creates first party

01:03:32,799 --> 01:03:36,400
cookies max

01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:38,319
that's true uh so it's it's not placing

01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:39,520
anything on the drop solid domain in our

01:03:38,319 --> 01:03:43,280
case it's only on

01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:46,319
the the domain uh that your website

01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:48,799
is looking at uh or is it

01:03:46,319 --> 01:03:50,000
located at and the patch for making

01:03:48,799 --> 01:03:51,440
multipliers

01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:53,039
work with layout builder it's more the

01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:56,319
patch about making

01:03:53,039 --> 01:03:59,599
personalization work with layout builder

01:03:56,319 --> 01:04:04,640
um and i take a look

01:03:59,599 --> 01:04:04,640
there um what is it

01:04:05,599 --> 01:04:11,200
i'm going to to find out

01:04:09,039 --> 01:04:13,760
um but there's a patch that actually has

01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:17,520
like uh conditions

01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:20,799
uh here this one but nick

01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:23,119
is isn't there also like a

01:04:20,799 --> 01:04:25,280
a change somewhere where we can use

01:04:23,119 --> 01:04:27,599
modic forms in blocks

01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:28,559
yeah that's fine but the the problem

01:04:27,599 --> 01:04:30,079
with the

01:04:28,559 --> 01:04:31,760
the layer builder is the visibility

01:04:30,079 --> 01:04:35,599
controls um

01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:37,280
so this patch it works great

01:04:35,599 --> 01:04:38,960
and you need it if you want layout

01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:43,119
builder to respond

01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:44,559
on the the cash contexts so

01:04:43,119 --> 01:04:46,880
i don't know chris if you can provide

01:04:44,559 --> 01:04:49,359
more information in the chat

01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:50,559
this is a massive issue i'm not entirely

01:04:49,359 --> 01:04:54,480
sure where it's at

01:04:50,559 --> 01:04:57,680
right now but the you know me

01:04:54,480 --> 01:05:00,799
uh controls that you saw before so i'll

01:04:57,680 --> 01:05:00,799
show it here in the block

01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:06,559
so somewhere yeah i'm logged out it

01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:09,039
doesn't really matter

01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:10,640
um but the the conditions are actually

01:05:09,039 --> 01:05:13,520
part of the visibility

01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:14,880
conditions um also the unomi module uses

01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:17,200
these conditions

01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:18,160
so if conditions work with dispatching

01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:19,839
lead builder

01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:22,400
then also personalization works with

01:05:19,839 --> 01:05:24,079
layout builder out of the box

01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:27,200
using any kind of condition including

01:05:24,079 --> 01:05:27,200
the you know me condition

01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:32,160
hopefully that makes sense for the

01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:32,160
people that are still here

01:05:35,599 --> 01:05:39,359
and chris that would be great if this

01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:41,119
issue gets committed at some point

01:05:39,359 --> 01:05:42,559
um but for now we're actually adding it

01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:46,480
as a patch to

01:05:42,559 --> 01:05:48,880
the projects that need this

01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:50,000
that's fine i'll i'll keep following it

01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:54,400
and i asked

01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:54,400
swentel to help us move it forward

01:05:56,480 --> 01:06:03,920
okay um i think

01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:06,240
that was about it for all the questions

01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:09,200
i'm so happy there's still like 35

01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:10,720
eyes looking just at us while actually

01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:13,839
we're wrapping it up

01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:16,640
so please give us some feedback in

01:06:13,839 --> 01:06:18,640
the the link that was shared earlier

01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:21,039
maybe please also reach out

01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:22,079
on twitter if you enjoyed this workshop

01:06:21,039 --> 01:06:26,799
it would really help

01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:26,799
also to promote this way of working

01:06:29,599 --> 01:06:37,680
