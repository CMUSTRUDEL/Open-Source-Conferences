Description: 
	Open source benefits from community collaboration a lot, in the form of
contributions of different types, but how sustainable they are may depend on the
amount of people around them.

okay we're on the hour

00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:13,759
so i will start first welcome everyone

00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:15,920
uh i'm going to talk to you about

00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:17,840
teams and why joining efforts to

00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:21,359
maintain projects

00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:22,800
can be a really good idea for the drupal

00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:26,240
community and

00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:31,359
first let me start

00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:34,079
with a bit about me i'm marco villegas

00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:35,520
you can find me on drupal.org as marvel

00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,840
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:41,120
and i have been involved in the drupal

00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:44,000
community for a while

00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:45,120
one of the things that i remember more

00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,559
most kindly

00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,440
is my participation on the migration

00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:52,719
from

00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:54,640
cbs to git a while ago

00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:57,199
and lately i have been doing a lot of

00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:59,760
things around migrations

00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:00,960
and currently i'm working as a senior

00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:04,479
software engineer

00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:06,799
at adap agency and i thank you

00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:09,119
them very much for allowing me to be

00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:12,320
here

00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:13,840
so say that i will like to start with

00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:17,119
highlighting a really

00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,400
important fact that i think we really

00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:23,119
need to acknowledge

00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:25,600
for uh to put some context on this stock

00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:26,479
as you can see on this graph most of

00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:30,079
open source

00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:33,439
projects really has only they have only

00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:35,200
one or two maintainers and that's pretty

00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:38,960
important to understand

00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:42,799
in this study by abelino in 2016

00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:45,840
they analyzed the top github projects by

00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:49,600
stars and they found that

00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:52,399
only 65 65

00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,840
of all those projects has only one or

00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:55,680
two

00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:56,799
maintainers and they actually provided a

00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,840
full

00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,399
way of how to calculate that vast factor

00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,159
which

00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:04,159
generally can be understand as the

00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:08,959
amount of people that need to disappear

00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:12,400
to disappear for the project to be style

00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:14,959
so let me start with uh also one

00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,480
uh model tail uh because this is

00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:19,599
something that i see a lot

00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:22,959
uh so you start writing uh one model

00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:24,800
and and then you think it can be useful

00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:25,599
for other things so you made it a bit

00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,480
more generic

00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:29,040
and then you share it on drupal.org and

00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,840
people

00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:34,080
start using it and that is great and

00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:37,040
then you get some feature requests

00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,840
and and the next week you maybe get to

00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,959
that and

00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:43,280
implement that and made a new release uh

00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:45,040
but over time maybe new back reports

00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,920
come new bug fixes

00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,840
uh are pending and the issue starts to

00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,840
grow

00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,959
and these things just happen in life and

00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,519
you can no longer

00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:58,560
dedicate that time or you move it on to

00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:02,000
other projects that need your attention

00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:04,159
and at the end activity stales and

00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,040
this is a pattern that i see in a lot of

00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:08,239
models uh

00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,720
not everyone not every model but a lot

00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:11,040
of

00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:13,680
projects i see that happen not only

00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:16,800
inside rupa but also outside

00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:20,159
and i think this is related with how we

00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:22,720
tend to see the maintainer

00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:23,360
usually we think of a maintainer as

00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,159
someone

00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,280
highly responsive truly involved and

00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:31,200
thorough on the

00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:33,920
code reviews and it adds new fixes

00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:37,040
new features and buffixes pretty quick

00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:40,480
and coordinate f4s

00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:42,959
it's really really high expectations and

00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:46,640
i think it will help a lot to think on

00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:48,560
the person behind that maintainer

00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,959
because that person may have family may

00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:54,560
have work and may have free time

00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:57,760
and in that free time uh maybe

00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:59,439
he does something else that is not

00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,799
related with technology

00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,799
and so it's pretty important to

00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:05,760
understand that the person has

00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:07,360
a person have multiple roles and that is

00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,920
the way i see maintainership

00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,519
as a role and we need to wear it and

00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:14,879
maintain their hats

00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:18,479
when we do those maintainership things

00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:21,680
but it's not a 24 7

00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:23,759
activity and

00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:26,000
now that we have a better understanding

00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:29,520
of what i mean by the maintainer

00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:32,639
why do we want maintainer teams i see

00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:33,040
two important uh two important things

00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,840
that

00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,280
will come from maintainer teams improve

00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:41,040
the health of the project

00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:43,360
and in three increase the trust chain

00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,280
but naturally if you have more people

00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,560
around a project we you will naturally

00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:49,840
increase this

00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:52,720
vast factor and it will be

00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,759
better overall uh but also when you have

00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,840
a team of people

00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:56,800
the motivation to interact also

00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:59,360
increases

00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,880
maybe you share some goals and that is

00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,120
also helpful

00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,919
and on the other side is the trust chain

00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,960
because

00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:08,000
our community is built over these bonds

00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:11,600
that

00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:15,280
are built between people

00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,919
and the more you can increase the stress

00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,400
change

00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:19,919
it will be better overall for the whole

00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,600
community

00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,960
and drupalcon is one of these events

00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,039
that helps a lot for that

00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,160
overall i think this will increase the

00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:28,880
sustainability

00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,840
of the projects themselves and the

00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:33,120
concept is not

00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:36,479
truly new uh the

00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:38,400
debian debian is one linux distribution

00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:40,560
that i really like and

00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,720
they have this idea of debian teams and

00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:45,840
i could bring that back

00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:48,720
a long time ago and also the

00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:50,080
genomic that is a desktop environment

00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,120
also

00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:56,319
has this idea of teams themselves and

00:05:53,120 --> 00:06:00,080
even our forces the software that we use

00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:01,280
to create software github has the idea

00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,479
of organization

00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:07,360
uh more than a decade ago and

00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:08,080
also gitlab has the same the equivalent

00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:12,400
groups

00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:15,520
uh added a from around that time

00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,400
and that is not even uh the concept is

00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,600
not really new

00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:22,400
in in drupal even

00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,120
because uh from the start there is in

00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,319
this commit

00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,960
there is in 2001 added the

00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:30,400
maintainer.txt file

00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:32,800
which listed all the all the subsystems

00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,400
of drupal and which persons you can

00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,560
contact for each part

00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,720
of the code and this is naturally highly

00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:41,520
influenced by the linux kernel 3 that

00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:43,600
has the same idea

00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:46,240
but it's great that we have that from

00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:49,520
the start and in 2002 around

00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:52,720
when cv cbs access uh

00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:55,199
was uh granted uh either for con

00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,000
core or for contrib so you actually can

00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:58,880
collaborate with

00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
many people in the contribute space uh

00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:03,199
because you

00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:06,720
naturally have access there but

00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:09,039
not even uh also inside our

00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:11,520
our forge we use this project model

00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:15,039
inside rupa.org to manage our issues

00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:18,880
and the i could trace the start of this

00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:22,319
uh in 2002 the the first idea is to

00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:24,880
to build what we now have as team

00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:26,720
as maintainers uh multiple maintainers

00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:29,039
for one project

00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:31,199
and not only that because we also had

00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:35,120
groups drupal.org

00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:38,240
our that hosted a lot of

00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:40,160
drupal user local user groups but also

00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:43,199
transversal things like

00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:46,720
the usability initiatives

00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:49,199
and the accessibility initiatives and

00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,639
also the initiatives themselves inside

00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:55,440
drupal core

00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:58,720
are what i consider teams inside drupal

00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:00,800
but i want to draw some attention from

00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,080
some learnings that maybe we can get

00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,599
from uh

00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,520
other projects like debian that i

00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:09,360
mentioned before they have

00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:11,280
this release team and this release team

00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,400
helps in the process of every two years

00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:16,240
now they are actually

00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:19,360
in the frozen stage so they decide

00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,639
how things will happen uh which bare set

00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:23,520
of version of each

00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:24,879
software will get into the next stable

00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:27,520
release of debian

00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,919
but not only that there is also teams

00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,479
for

00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:32,240
language packaging so there is a team of

00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:34,479
uh for php

00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,080
uh that naturally packaged software

00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:39,279
greeting in php that

00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:42,560
uh so i participated briefly in that uh

00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:44,399
team and it was great to see how you can

00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:47,120
collaborate with others and

00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:47,920
learn from others because you share the

00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:51,279
same

00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:54,959
processes to produce these

00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:57,600
packages and there are many more and

00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:58,240
in the same way in the genome project

00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,200
they are

00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:02,240
they also have this release team that

00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,880
provide

00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,839
the the guidelines for how which

00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:09,120
software to

00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:09,839
to ship but more importantly they have

00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,680
this ux

00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:14,000
design team which maintains a document

00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:17,200
that is pretty important for genome

00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
the human the guidelines for human

00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,120
interacts

00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,360
interactive interfaces and

00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,240
human design interface and they that

00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:27,600
document is

00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:30,880
pretty uh much what decides

00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:34,880
uh how the ui should be built

00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:37,839
inside uh a graphic interface uh

00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:39,120
inside a software so and they

00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:41,120
collaborate a lot on

00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,880
how to bring the document and they

00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:46,000
maintain that document which is

00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:49,200
pretty important for them and

00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,680
inside drupal ourselves we

00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,360
uh as i mentioned we already have this

00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,480
uh

00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:55,360
maintainer.txt and there are a lot of

00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,160
teams around

00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,760
drupal already the the subsistence

00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:01,920
themselves in core that the

00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,519
team for caro the team for configuration

00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:06,240
api

00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,560
for javascript for accessibility there

00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,839
are

00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:12,959
many names listed there and

00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:15,440
but i see that core is pretty strong

00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:16,160
and they have lots of people around but

00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,320
contrib

00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,680
not so much and that is what i want to

00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,079
focus on

00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:23,120
and just before doing that the tools

00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:26,240
that we use

00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:29,920
uh are help on that process

00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:33,200
and we have the debian project

00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:34,640
using pretty even multiple uh version

00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,560
control systems uh

00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,839
for maintaining the package which is a

00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,760
bit insane but

00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:41,600
they are really all projects so they

00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:44,640
have pretty old code too

00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:46,880
in several places and and

00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:48,320
in the other side in both genome and

00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:51,440
drupal just get one

00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:54,959
uh project one repository per project

00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,440
and that is great and on the tracker

00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:59,200
part

00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:00,480
they deviant use a custom system called

00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,800
debugs that

00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,760
i think they they're the main users of

00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,079
that system

00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:07,760
but they are starts also starting to use

00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:10,399
gitlab and genome 2

00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:12,720
and drupal we have already started to

00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:14,000
use gitlab as the code repository not

00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,399
yet for issues but

00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,120
maybe in the future as dries suggested

00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:19,760
on

00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,720
this week on the on the talk and

00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:23,519
communication

00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:25,279
uh is is also pretty different debian

00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:29,360
used mainly mailing lists

00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:33,040
and irc and genome used this

00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:36,240
matrix protocol and rocket chat

00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:37,600
and in drupal we mainly are talking

00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:40,480
inside issues and

00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,600
as drupal slack but what i want to

00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,880
highlight here

00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:47,279
is that even we have a pretty diverse

00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:49,760
set of tools not every tool that we use

00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:51,440
need to support the idea directly of

00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:54,720
teams

00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:58,480
so what i envision is that there will be

00:11:54,720 --> 00:12:01,600
maybe more alternatives of teams

00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:04,720
that we can create inside

00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:06,800
the drupal space and i'm

00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,240
really involved in many things around

00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:11,920
migration so

00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:14,000
maybe a team around the migrate plus my

00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:16,800
great tools my great manifest

00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,600
and many more other my great models that

00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:21,360
are

00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:22,720
starting can be a good idea and in the

00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,639
same way i see the same

00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,760
there are already groups of people

00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:28,480
around the

00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:29,360
commerce set of models uh commerce

00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,760
recruiting or

00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:33,279
commerce shipping and in search is the

00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:37,040
same search api

00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:40,240
facets search api solar and more

00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:43,519
and so even there

00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:46,800
this is not really open for more ideas

00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:49,279
so let me try to round it up

00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,480
uh with some conclusions i think that

00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:52,399
teams are

00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,600
a really great idea for the super

00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:55,920
community and

00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,920
it all starts and thinking of

00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:01,279
maintainership as a role

00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:04,639
that you take in some cases

00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:07,600
and overall it will help

00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:08,240
to improve the health of the open source

00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,920
projects

00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,680
because it will increase this stress

00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:14,160
factor that i started

00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:16,639
with on the presentation and it will

00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:18,320
also strengthen the trust chain uh on

00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:21,440
the community which is

00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:23,279
really important and overall it will

00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:25,120
increase the sustainability of the

00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:27,600
projects

00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,320
so again this is a known idea in the

00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,519
world and

00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:34,639
even us we are is using it a lot but

00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:37,760
mainly on drupal core and hence

00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:38,160
we can really improve the ecosystem in

00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:42,000
the

00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:45,199
contrib side is if we start

00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,519
trying to promote this idea of teams and

00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:48,880
so

00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:50,160
overall i think that adding the idea of

00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:53,279
teams in some way

00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:56,320
again our software doesn't really need

00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:58,959
to support it directly

00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:00,079
but the the idea itself can be pretty

00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:03,760
pretty

00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:04,480
powerful and we can even uh formalize it

00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,320
and maybe

00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,519
now that we are trying to move into

00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:10,639
gitlab we

00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:13,680
we can actually start uh

00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:16,399
using the the idea of

00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:17,199
uh gitlab groups directly and integrated

00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:20,800
in some way

00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:23,680
into our drupal.org website

00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:27,680
until we actually migrate totally into

00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:30,320
gitlab if that happens at some point

00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,720
and those are really the main ideas that

00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,959
i

00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,560
wanted to talk to you about so thank you

00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:37,199
very much for being here

00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:38,480
this presentation will be available

00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:41,440
later

00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:43,680
but just in case this is the study that

00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:46,240
i was

00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:47,519
mentioning on the star so now i'm pretty

00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:50,959
open for

00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:54,240
uh for questions i will now go into the

00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:56,800
hopping window

00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,160
and please feel free to ask we don't

00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:02,160
have much time

00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:06,240
but i have uh created uh also

00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:07,920
a teams channel in the drupal slack so

00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:11,199
feel free to

00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:14,399
contact me there directly uh if

00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:16,959
you uh have uh any questions uh but

00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:17,440
and uh mari i think we still have some

00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:20,240
time

00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:21,680
uh uh please correct me if i am wrong

00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:24,160
and i will be happy to

00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,800
continue answering questions if there is

00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:28,160
continue

00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:31,199
you have time thank you

00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:34,720
so uh please go ahead and

00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:37,279
ask some questions if you have some

00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,920
oh someone remember the great kid

00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:40,800
migration

00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:55,839
yeah that happened a while ago but it

00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:55,839
was pretty exciting

00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,040
uh the name of the slack channel is

00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:03,120
themes

00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:06,639
so i will just type it here

00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:08,800
and i'm already there

00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:10,320
so if we want to continue the

00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:13,839
conversation in time

00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:23,839
that is the the place that we can

00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:23,839
continue talking about it and

00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:32,160
i see one new question maybe we should

00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:35,040
have

00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:36,079
cross model teams like team dedicating

00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:39,279
to improving

00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:41,120
read means yes uh and i'm

00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:42,320
so the teams i suggested are like

00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,959
focused on

00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,759
one thing specifically so migrate is a

00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:48,560
topic

00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:50,079
but as i mentioned in other projects

00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:53,199
they have in individual and this

00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:56,320
science uh team package software

00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:59,120
related to science so the topic of

00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,519
of the team can be really open it is not

00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,160
uh

00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:03,839
it's not restricted so it is not

00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:07,199
actually about

00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:09,600
even having access direct access but

00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:10,720
the but it is just the idea of getting

00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:14,079
together to one

00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:16,319
specific goal or one set of goals that

00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:17,199
you want to promote and that is pretty

00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:22,079
powerful

00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:22,079
and i think that just i know

00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:26,959
making it more

00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:32,480
improve a lot the sustainability overall

00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:35,360
ecosystem

00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:37,679
there is one more question about uh

00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:40,799
would this channel be a great place for

00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:43,679
someone that wants to start contributing

00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:44,320
uh yes that like this has just been

00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:46,559
started but

00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:48,480
if you are standing to contribute it uh

00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:51,520
there is a contribute channel

00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:53,919
and if you are starting to contribute to

00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,640
i would highly suggest to go to the

00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:57,760
sessions

00:17:54,640 --> 00:18:01,039
at uh after the talks in this

00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:02,880
uh this morning uh because the the

00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:05,120
mentoring part of the day

00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,000
has really great people that can guide

00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:08,000
you a lot

00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,039
on the details on how you can start

00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,520
contributing

00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:12,400
and that is not only code it can be many

00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:15,440
things

00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:18,400
so please go to the mentorship

00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,400
uh event

00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:23,280
uh there's one more question does your

00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:25,200
team's proposal include any sort of

00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:28,400
funding model

00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:31,600
no i am not thinking uh in

00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:34,160
funding at this point i i'm just

00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:35,200
trying to join together people that are

00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:38,559
already doing

00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:40,480
work in many fronts and i think it

00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:43,280
should be independent uh because

00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,840
at the end someone may have some paid

00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:47,280
time

00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:50,480
uh to do something but uh there's also

00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:51,679
a lot of volunteers that do uh things on

00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:54,320
their time

00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:56,320
and i think that this uh there needs to

00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:59,679
be a balance that

00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:02,320
of this and yeah so i

00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:03,280
would not like to tie it directly to a

00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:06,640
funding model

00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:09,520
but it may also be a way to

00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:11,280
clarify who can help or who can get

00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:15,200
funding

00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:25,840
together in a in a team if that is the

00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:25,840
the way one specific team decides to go

00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:43,039
well i don't see many more questions but

00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:45,760
feel free to ask and again

00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:46,960
maybe the the team's channel on the

00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,400
slide can be the

00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,320
the right place to continue the

00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:54,240
conversation later

00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:54,240
uh for specific steps

00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:07,039
yeah thanks mario also for the help here

00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:21,840
and

00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:21,840
thanks for attending

00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:00,240
