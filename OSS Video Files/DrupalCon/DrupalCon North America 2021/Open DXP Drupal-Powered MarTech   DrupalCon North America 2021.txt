all right everyone

00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:15,679
good morning hope everyone's having

00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:18,160
an amazing start to drupalcon 2021

00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:19,520
thank you all so so much for joining us

00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,720
for open dxp

00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:24,640
drupal-powered martech session today my

00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:27,199
name is christina walker-bryant

00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,400
and i am joined by my colleague nick

00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:30,240
switzer

00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,760
and today we're going to be digging into

00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,160
the concept of

00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,520
a digital experience platform and how it

00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:38,480
relates to marketers

00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,480
and open source communities at large and

00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,040
before we get started i did want to

00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,520
mention

00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,399
that our session today will be more of a

00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,200
fireside

00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:49,280
chat format so more conversational

00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,920
between nick and myself i know

00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,879
everyone is probably super fatigued of

00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,440
looking at

00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:56,559
long bulky zoom power points after a

00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,800
year in quarantine

00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:01,120
so we're going to keep this pretty light

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,520
um nice approachable feel and

00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,799
more relaxed and informal definitely

00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,360
feel free to

00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:09,200
ask questions via the chat feature we

00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,880
have a great setup here

00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,360
and nick and i will leave a couple of

00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:15,520
minutes after our session here

00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,520
for some conversation and interacting

00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:20,479
with your q a

00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,159
and before i jump in and get us going

00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:23,840
just to let you all know a little bit

00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:26,799
more about myself

00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:29,280
as i said i'm christina walker-bryant i

00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:30,720
am currently a senior account manager at

00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,960
elevated third

00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,159
and i've worked on the client services

00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,799
and account management

00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:38,799
and of website development agencies and

00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,479
digital marketing companies for the last

00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:42,960
eight years or so

00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:45,040
and at elevated third specifically i'm

00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:48,079
working with mostly b2b sas

00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,040
companies on large drupal implementation

00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:50,560
projects

00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,079
so you know a little bit more about

00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,320
myself um

00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:56,079
nick i'd love to kick it over to you to

00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,759
uh let the group know more about your

00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:00,079
background and your role

00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:02,079
yeah for sure thanks for the great intro

00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:03,600
christina

00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:05,439
like christina said i'm the development

00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,880
director at elevated third so um

00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:08,479
been at elevated third for a little over

00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,879
10 years been working with drupal for

00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,160
like

00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:13,760
11 12 so um a lot of in the weeds

00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,840
technical experience there and i think

00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,599
you know as as of late like my role has

00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,040
been a lot more focused on

00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:20,640
sort of like a consultative

00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,000
architectural role which i think has

00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:25,280
been really neat and kind of like

00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,280
what led us to this presentation um

00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,480
you know because i think there's just so

00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,200
much tied up

00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:33,360
in the implementation of like a

00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,800
complicated marketing technology stack

00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,599
and you know drupal can be a really

00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,680
great

00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:39,120
tool at the center of all that and um

00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,959
you know that ends up being my role

00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,640
working with our clients is kind of like

00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,239
helping bridge the gap between you know

00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:46,239
what are you trying to accomplish how do

00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:47,680
these tools actually work with like

00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:49,680
you know how can we use drupal as

00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,480
efficiently as possible to kind of serve

00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:54,400
as that

00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:56,400
hub for a larger martech ecosystem

00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,239
that can you know hopefully add some

00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,360
longevity scalability and

00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:01,840
unify your systems a lot more so all of

00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,879
that

00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,959
said uh let's let's jump in

00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:08,800
so you know like like christina said

00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:10,480
we're testing out the fireside chat

00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,680
format we're excited to

00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,519
do something a little bit new at

00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,519
drupalcon so you know we'll just have a

00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:18,800
few kind of like prompt slides up that

00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:22,000
we've broken the discussion out into um

00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:23,760
so let's let's dig in um and you know to

00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,319
get started i think like we wanted to

00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,959
talk just

00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:28,319
in a little more detail about what is a

00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:29,920
dxp because i think

00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:32,400
you know everybody's probably seen the

00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,239
acronym around everybody's probably

00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,519
read the gartner definition i think you

00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:37,200
know we want to pick that apart a little

00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:38,720
bit but just for the sake of getting us

00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,480
all on the same page i want to read that

00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:43,200
gartner definition real quick

00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,799
um so that says that it's a well

00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,640
integrated and cohesive set of

00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:47,519
technologies designed to enable the

00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,840
composition

00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:52,319
management delivery and optimization of

00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:54,080
contextualized digital experiences

00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:55,599
across multi-experienced customer

00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,840
journeys so

00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:59,120
that's that's a mouthful right there's

00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,480
there's a lot there and i think what we

00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,439
really want to do in this first section

00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,159
is just like

00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:05,360
unpack that a little bit and talk about

00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:08,799
you know

00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:12,080
how our idea of an open dxp

00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:13,519
fits into that so i guess christina like

00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,360
what do you think like let's let's go

00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,239
past the buzzword and you know talk a

00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,160
little bit about

00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:20,239
what dxp actually means and kind of like

00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,639
what you've been seeing out in the wild

00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:24,560
yeah let's do it i think uh nick you

00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:26,960
already touched on something

00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,600
interesting right as marketers we have

00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,639
these

00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:33,120
big sexy buzz words that you know

00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:34,080
are all about branding but at its core

00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,040
how do we

00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:38,560
simplify this and i think let's take

00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,199
that acronym

00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,320
break it down digital experience

00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:45,280
platform

00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,840
it's not really prescriptive of anything

00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,880
right

00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:51,680
what is this getting at and i have

00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:53,600
a really um interesting graphic i love

00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,479
to share really quickly with the group

00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,040
here

00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:58,240
it looks a lot like a game of thrones

00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,479
map right now

00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,919
i keep using that joke i think i see

00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:05,199
westeros over there

00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:08,560
it never gets old but here

00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:10,320
is essentially a visual of the marketing

00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,280
technology landscape

00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,479
as you all can see there's thousands of

00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,800
tools right

00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:18,960
and there's probably hundreds of

00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,840
thousands of combinations

00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:23,039
and really what we're getting at here is

00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,680
the integration

00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:28,800
of these digital properties into a

00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:31,759
digital ecosystem so the marriage

00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,840
between all of these different products

00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:35,759
and solutions that you see

00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,039
and i think that it's important to

00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:40,160
mention from an

00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:42,320
open dxp definition standpoint that

00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,600
what we're doing is integrating with

00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:46,800
best in breed

00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:49,840
tools to accomplish marketing goals

00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,240
and when we say best and breed that can

00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,280
be

00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,720
absolutely subjective there's a number

00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:58,319
of different factors

00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:01,199
we're talking about budget team size

00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:02,160
marketing goals tech capabilities

00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:05,440
industry

00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:09,039
the list is endless right and i think

00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:11,280
that this visual definitely hearkens to

00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:12,400
what all is out there it's a massive

00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,720
landscape

00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,680
and nick i'm really curious to hear from

00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,240
you um

00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:22,479
from the tekken what are some tools that

00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,479
would typically be a part of the dxp

00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,919
yeah definitely so i i think your point

00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,240
about um

00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:30,479
it being subjective is a good one right

00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:33,440
because like in in our experience we're

00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:34,080
working with like b2b companies who have

00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,160
pretty long

00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,600
sales cycles like pretty complex

00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,600
products which i think

00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,199
lends itself to a specific tool set but

00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,680
just thinking about kind of like the

00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:44,639
general capabilities that are probably

00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,039
present in most

00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,800
dxps you're talking about you know

00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:51,680
things like personalization

00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:53,360
probably um a marketing automation

00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,120
platform which you know that could be

00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,039
you know mailchimp that could be part of

00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,160
marketo kind of depending on your scale

00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:01,280
and your needs

00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:03,520
um uh you know a crm

00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,720
probably salesforce but you know maybe

00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,800
something else

00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,080
um cdp's i think we're starting to see a

00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,080
lot more of um

00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:12,240
and you know for anyone who hasn't heard

00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,440
that acronym cdp's customer data

00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,240
platform and that's

00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:18,400
kind of like the idea of a unifying data

00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,080
platform that is pulling

00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,919
all of your different analytics tools

00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,360
and and marketing tools together and

00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:24,800
making that data available in a single

00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,960
consolidated place

00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,319
which is kind of a neat idea um you know

00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,160
i mean i think you can kind of go

00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:32,160
outside of some of that core stuff

00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,840
and start to get more into you know

00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,560
maybe there's like some e-commerce

00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,120
components um you know in in more the

00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,720
b2b

00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,400
or i'm sorry the b to c side maybe

00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,240
there's some like pos integration

00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,800
things like that but i think you know we

00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:47,919
won't beat that too much to death um

00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:49,039
so like you know that all of that said

00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:51,759
like

00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:52,479
christina like why do you think an open

00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:54,639
dxp

00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:55,840
is a good thing for marketing teams that

00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:57,360
that you've worked with like how does

00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,240
this kind of approach of like mixing and

00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:02,080
matching like

00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:04,479
enable strategic marketing yeah

00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,840
um nick i think that's interesting

00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:09,039
because

00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:11,039
when we think of open dxp i think people

00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:13,120
are thinking that you have to tear

00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:14,160
everything down right i've got to start

00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,400
from scratch but

00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,520
essentially it's actually the exact

00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:20,879
opposite

00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:21,360
um it allows you to use what you already

00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:23,840
have

00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:26,000
and you have the flexibility to pivot

00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:28,240
and add in new approaches

00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,840
and build upon and enhance what you

00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,360
already have in place and i think that

00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:34,000
that's really key

00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,880
for marketers and especially in the

00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,599
times we are

00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,240
in now right marketing is often one of

00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:40,800
the first

00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,000
uh departments that gets cut when

00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:45,120
budgets are an issue

00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,440
so having something that is

00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:49,839
gives you the ability to scale i think

00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:52,399
is really really important and

00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:54,240
clients and the businesses and companies

00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:56,959
that they work within

00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,560
they are heavily invested in the tools

00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:01,040
that they already are using

00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:02,320
so tearing everything down is absolutely

00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:05,360
not an option

00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:07,519
and when i talk about investment we're

00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,519
talking about lengthy contracts i was

00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:12,000
talking to a client the other day that's

00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:13,279
um working with a marketing automation

00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,320
platform that they're

00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:18,480
in a five-year contract right that's

00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,920
crazy when we think about how quickly

00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,000
things are moving

00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,360
um we're also talking about monetary

00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,519
investment so

00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:28,399
getting a lot of these systems stood up

00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:31,920
is often a six-figure undertaking

00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:34,959
oftentimes and then one of my pc

00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:37,839
account management terms um i'd like to

00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:40,320
call rigid organizational preferences

00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:41,360
so for example you have people at the c

00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,839
suite level

00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,279
that have always used x system their

00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:47,680
entire career

00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:49,200
or they have a very strong relationship

00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:52,399
with the c-suite

00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:55,040
level um team member of another company

00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:57,680
so you know some of those relational

00:09:55,040 --> 00:10:00,480
pieces that can't necessarily be broken

00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:02,480
those things are not necessarily

00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:05,440
barriers or pain points

00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,160
or blockers when you are working from an

00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,200
open

00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:12,240
dxp um perspective

00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:13,360
and just to round that down regardless

00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:16,079
of those factors

00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:18,399
and open exp allows you to essentially

00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:20,160
optimize what you already have right

00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:22,399
but not only that it gives you the

00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:24,959
opportunity to maximize

00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:27,519
where you want to go in the future and

00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:30,959
build upon what you currently have

00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:33,279
um and nick from your perspective

00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:36,399
how does an open dxp fit in your world

00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:38,720
on the tech in devon

00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:39,839
yeah definitely i i like your point

00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,160
about you know it

00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:43,279
it you know we want it to be a flexible

00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,760
thing like we're not

00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:48,000
sort of trying to like gatekeep around

00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:49,040
what this idea of dxp can be and you

00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,959
know we're not

00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,800
sort of like mandating that something

00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:54,160
existing gets torn down like it really

00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,480
enables that

00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,519
agility and i think you know that makes

00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:00,720
me think about

00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:02,240
like back i think it was in 2018 or 2019

00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,399
when adobe

00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,480
acquired magento i thought freeze wrote

00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:07,200
a great blog post that had some really

00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,760
nice

00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,720
quotables in it um you know in

00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:14,640
particular

00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:15,920
you know around this idea of um

00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,600
i'm trying to think like what the best

00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:19,519
way to compare him is but sort of like

00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,920
the larger sort of monolithic wall

00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:24,320
garden type system versus a more

00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:26,399
open approach right and like what he

00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,600
said and i wish i had the exact quote in

00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,399
front of me but it was something along

00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,800
the lines of

00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:31,680
we need to innovate through integration

00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,360
so you know

00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,959
a similar approach to what the drupal

00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,399
community takes in developing triple

00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:38,560
core you know that like

00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:40,560
we're you know we're not trying to kind

00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:42,480
of like be everything to everyone or

00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:44,560
build one gigantic thing that can do

00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,079
everything we want to take what we have

00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,760
put drupal at the center of it take

00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:49,839
advantage of what it's really good at

00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:51,519
and integrate all of those tools

00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:53,120
together so that we can swap them out

00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:53,760
and you know exactly like you said make

00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,959
the most

00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:58,639
of what we have not necessarily

00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:00,079
tear it all down and start from scratch

00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:03,760
and have to have sort of like that

00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:06,800
rebuilding period um

00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:08,959
so all of that said i think that you

00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:11,839
know is really starting to get at

00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:13,600
this idea of agility right like we want

00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:15,680
to be able to

00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,680
move quickly we want to be able to get

00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:20,399
things done efficiently

00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:21,519
so that i think is a great transition to

00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:24,480
our second section

00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:26,399
um agility and stability like are these

00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:30,560
things opposing forces

00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:32,160
um so before we like dig too deep into

00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:34,079
that idea i think like there's

00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:36,160
some good context i'd like to get from

00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:38,079
you christina just around like

00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,440
from from what you've seen like since

00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:40,959
you know i think you're a lot more in

00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,480
contact with like the marketing teams

00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:44,480
and users and things like that where you

00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,560
know my world is a lot more kind of like

00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,160
in the needs integration things like

00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,880
that you know like

00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,360
what you know in your experience like is

00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,399
this

00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:56,959
is like a dxp necessary to support the

00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:59,440
modern web user journey kind of in

00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:01,839
in our new reality of you know lots of

00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:04,399
devices and hopefully post covid

00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:06,079
soon but in general i think just like

00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:08,480
more remote more devices more

00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:09,360
web yeah what do you think yeah no nick

00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,800
this is a great point

00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,519
in short yes it is it's definitely vital

00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,800
and

00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:18,240
specifically to what we're seeing from a

00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:21,279
user standpoint now

00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:23,360
um as you know in our process we go

00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:26,240
through a discovery phase before we move

00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:29,760
forward with any implementation project

00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:30,800
and as we're digging into our clients

00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:33,839
businesses

00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:36,720
and um their solutions and products

00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:38,399
were also very much absorbing their

00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:41,040
customer experience

00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:42,160
and what we're seeing is users are no

00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:45,040
longer taking

00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:46,800
this quintessential linear route from a

00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:49,120
buying standpoint right

00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,240
that gone are the days where we're

00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,160
searching

00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,680
we're being taken to the website and

00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:56,800
then we're purchasing

00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:58,000
um users are shifting in and out of that

00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:01,199
buyer journey

00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,760
um well over how they've used to

00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:04,240
so at this place we have to meet them

00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,720
where

00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:08,720
they're at right and they're at a lot of

00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:12,079
different areas and touch points

00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:15,120
um product price those are still

00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:18,560
very much key drivers into the

00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:21,519
overall buyer journey and buyer process

00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:24,320
however customer experiences are

00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:27,440
becoming more vital than ever

00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:30,560
um i'll give a quick analogy but um

00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:34,079
my favorite restaurant right they have

00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:35,760
probably like average food the prizes

00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:38,880
are not that friendly

00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:40,000
but the experience the ambiance the tone

00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:43,519
the service

00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,720
all of that is exactly why i continue to

00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:47,760
come back

00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,639
and i think the users are very much like

00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,680
this right

00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:54,800
and where we're beating out competitors

00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:58,639
is creating a frictionless um

00:14:54,800 --> 00:15:01,040
experience and and meeting the users at

00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:03,519
all of these different touch points so

00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:05,199
there's a need now more than ever

00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:06,959
on the marketing end just to have a

00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:08,880
highly adaptable

00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:10,240
and connected digital marketing

00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:12,959
ecosystem and

00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,600
hence the shift towards the dxp approach

00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:17,199
um

00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:19,519
nick you mentioned agility stability

00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:21,519
how does that all kind of marry together

00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:25,040
and what are some of the nuances on the

00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:25,040
tekken from your standpoint

00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:29,600
yeah definitely so i mean it integration

00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,600
is kind of like

00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,880
the word of the hour i guess right where

00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,560
like we're gonna really like

00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:36,560
use that as the way to tie this stuff

00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:38,560
together and i mean i think like

00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:40,079
that's why what you said about the user

00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:42,000
journey i think is a really interesting

00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:43,600
like segue into that because like it

00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,639
hadn't even occurred to me until we were

00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,480
starting to

00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:48,000
talk about this in the presentation you

00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,759
know and put this together that it's

00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,399
like oh yeah you know user journeys are

00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:52,079
like

00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:54,160
way more fragmented and all over the

00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:55,759
place and that's why you know all of

00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,320
these new tools are popping up is

00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:58,800
because yeah

00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:00,160
they're more complex and i think like

00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,720
you know that's why

00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:04,079
drupal is a really great center point

00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,000
for that because that's

00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:08,480
hopefully going to be like the north

00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,440
star in your martech system in the sense

00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,000
that like

00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:13,839
that can be like the source of truth for

00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,519
you know all of your content all of your

00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:16,959
content admins and things like that and

00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:19,839
with tools like

00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:21,519
layout builder and json api and you know

00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:22,000
a host of others like kind of depending

00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:23,759
on the scale

00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,759
of what you're using like that gives us

00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:27,519
the ability to quickly crank out like

00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:28,320
marketing landing pages when we need

00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:31,279
them

00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:33,199
um or push our content out to you know

00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:33,759
whatever platform or device you might

00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:36,399
need to

00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:37,279
without having to do that in multiple

00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:39,920
places or

00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:40,480
go outside drupal so i mean i think you

00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,560
know that's

00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:44,240
that's the agility side of it and i mean

00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,600
i think the the stability comes in the

00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:48,399
sense that i mean just like

00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,040
drupal is an enterprise platform you

00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:51,120
know i mean it's

00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:53,040
it's proven at scale as i think you know

00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:55,279
i i would guess most people here have

00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,560
kind of heard of like a lot of the the

00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:58,480
big names that use it and

00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:00,160
and things like that but um you know i

00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,560
think it really serves as a great

00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:03,759
unifying factor for this absolutely and

00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,880
i was going to pause for a quick second

00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:06,079
because it looked like we got a question

00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,839
in chat i wanted to make sure we

00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:09,679
addressed it in context as james was

00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:11,520
saying can you say more about the shift

00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:13,360
from search and find customer buyer

00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:15,120
journey to what it is now

00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:16,799
is that people are finding more through

00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:18,079
social networks and content marketing

00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:20,079
versus intentionally

00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:21,360
searching sounds like you'd have some

00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:21,839
thoughts on that christina what do you

00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:24,079
think yeah

00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:26,240
no i think james that's a very good

00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:29,840
point because that's absolutely it

00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:32,720
um we're finding that uh users are

00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:34,240
coming to our clients websites not just

00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,480
through search anymore

00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:38,320
they're coming from interacting with

00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:41,520
them on social media they're coming

00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:43,840
through um you know i mean

00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:46,480
even i think we have a client now that's

00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:49,600
on snapchat and tick tock

00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:52,640
and we taking that context

00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:55,360
of the platform that they're coming from

00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:56,320
and serving them up content that is

00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,320
based on

00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:00,160
what we know about them from where they

00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:02,559
came in is exactly

00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:04,400
it and having some of these tools in

00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:07,120
place nick will probably mention

00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:08,559
them a little bit more personalization

00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,960
smart content

00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:11,840
which is a module that we heavily rely

00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,400
on

00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:16,880
those are some of the unifying factors

00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:20,400
that no matter if someone is finding you

00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:23,600
via tick tock which is wild now right

00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:26,320
that you have um information

00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:27,360
and content that is geared to where they

00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,200
have come from

00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:31,280
and um you're meeting them where they're

00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,880
at absolutely that's a great question

00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:34,880
james

00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,960
yeah the the personalization example is

00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,880
a great one and i'll keep this brief so

00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,559
we can keep going but i know like

00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,160
you know something we talk a lot about

00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:43,760
in in our

00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:45,919
i guess internal meetings and and with

00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:48,480
our clients is like you know a walk

00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:49,280
um i can't even get it straight like

00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,520
walking

00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,880
approach something like personalization

00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,600
or just all of this in general right

00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,960
where like

00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,240
you know maybe with those social

00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,160
campaigns and things like that you're

00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:00,720
not doing any personalization but you're

00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:03,120
tracking those with utm parameters

00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,760
right like with a module like smart

00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,640
content

00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:08,000
um you can do things like create

00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,919
segments based on

00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,840
utn parameters and then show

00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:12,160
personalized content based on those so

00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:15,200
like

00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:17,679
relatively low level of effort but

00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:19,919
pretty high impact in terms of being

00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:21,440
able to show users more relevant content

00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:23,280
because you know a little bit more about

00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:27,200
where they're coming from

00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:29,440
so real life agility i guess and

00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,440
so

00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,520
getting into it like you know i think

00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:35,919
those are some good examples of like

00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:37,440
real-life integrations i guess like you

00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:38,080
know christina in your experience like

00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,000
how's how's

00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,200
it actually working for marketing teams

00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,440
like you know

00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,960
is can can this be a reality like do

00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:47,280
they actually have the flexibility to

00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,559
take kind of this diy approach is it

00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,960
sort of like an in the middle thing

00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:52,960
where they're still bound to legacy tech

00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,880
um like what what does that look like in

00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:57,280
the wild from what you've seen yeah

00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,799
um nick i have a little bit of a hot

00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:00,720
take for you so i think we're getting

00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:03,919
comfortable with the group and i'm gonna

00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:06,799
i'm gonna keep it very real um a lot

00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:08,480
of our clients actually and we mostly

00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:11,039
liaison between

00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:12,000
the marketing departments so directors

00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:15,679
of marketing

00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:18,320
cmos but i'm finding that ctos

00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:18,799
and technical directors nick no shade to

00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:22,080
you

00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:23,760
on the technical directorate um they're

00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:26,080
making these key decisions

00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:27,600
and these are decisions that really

00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:30,799
should be spearheaded

00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:35,120
by marketing team decision makers and

00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:37,919
what's happening is the technology

00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:38,799
is being put first as opposed to the

00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:42,159
strategy

00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:44,720
or the marketing lens right and

00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:46,400
what's happening is the marketers are in

00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:49,360
a position where they're essentially

00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,840
chasing the technology like catching up

00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,360
with

00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:53,520
okay here are the systems here the

00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:57,039
capabilities that are already in place

00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:58,799
let me navigate a strategy that works

00:20:57,039 --> 00:21:02,559
within the tools that i

00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:06,240
am uh going to be using or going to be

00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:10,320
subjected to using and that's happening

00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:13,440
instead of really leading that process

00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:14,640
and spearheading it based on marketing

00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,960
initiatives and

00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:19,440
and what your roadmap looks like right

00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:23,200
what your strategic roadmap looks like

00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:25,280
and it's really interesting that a lot

00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:27,760
of the strategic drivers

00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:30,000
on the marketing end have been kind of

00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:32,880
taken out of some of those conversations

00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,480
right like who's in the room when we're

00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:37,600
deciding to go with this

00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:38,960
marketing automation tool or this email

00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:42,000
marketing tool

00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:43,919
who who's in those conversations and

00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,679
oftentimes we're finding that sometimes

00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:49,039
those louder voices in the room

00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:49,840
are specifically niche to the technical

00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:52,240
side

00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,880
so i know there can sometimes be

00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:56,159
friction

00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:57,520
between the the marketing side and then

00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:00,720
the tech side

00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:03,919
so nick how do you feel that these

00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:06,159
opposing forces what we'll call them how

00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:08,559
how can they really work together and

00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:12,880
and come together and be productive

00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:14,720
and collaborate um on both ends

00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,799
yeah definitely it's it's interesting

00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:17,440
that you say opposing forces just

00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:19,440
because

00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:21,200
you know i think in a successful

00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,400
relationship like you really don't want

00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,760
that to be the case

00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,600
you know and i think a lot of that

00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:27,600
probably comes just sort of from

00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,240
traditional organizational structure of

00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,159
like

00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:31,919
you know it is kind of over here and

00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:33,760
they're the ones like in the server room

00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:34,640
running the exchange servers and things

00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:36,000
like that

00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,679
marketing is over here and they're the

00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,320
ones selling the products and i think

00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:41,520
like

00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:43,600
this sort of new era of marketing and

00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,400
tech or you know web 3.0 whatever you

00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:47,280
want to call it

00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:48,640
has created this interesting role that i

00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:50,159
think a lot of people aren't really

00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,280
prepared for that's kind of like a

00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:52,720
marketing

00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:54,159
developer or like a marketing

00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,919
technologist or whatever you want to

00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:57,039
call that i mean

00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:58,720
obviously you know to the point of

00:22:57,039 --> 00:23:00,159
agility like you want to do the best

00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,600
with what you have and i think like we

00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:04,320
can definitely meet in the middle

00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:06,080
and you know tech can get better versed

00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:08,159
in marketing and understand the tools

00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:09,840
and what that team is trying to do and

00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:11,200
you know marketing can you know

00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,480
understand their tools in a little more

00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,240
depth to kind of like understand the

00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,640
capabilities and and work together

00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,520
to make those as effective as possible

00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:19,360
you know

00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:21,039
always being led by the strategy though

00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:22,559
like i think that's the key and that

00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:24,559
you know again another thing that

00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:25,600
christina you like blew my mind with as

00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:27,280
we were

00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:29,280
presentations ago that i was just like

00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,240
ah like it seemed so obvious but it just

00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,400
never really

00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:34,240
like occurred to me in my role and you

00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:36,000
know i mean i think back to

00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,600
some of the work that we've done like

00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,159
with our clients here at elevated third

00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,320
that

00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:41,840
you know that that exact thing has

00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,480
happened you know like we've done things

00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,720
like

00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:46,880
use integrated demand base with smart

00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:50,400
content so that we can use

00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:52,400
firmographic data from demandbase to

00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:54,240
personalized content and smart content

00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,600
and that you know that really took like

00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,279
a lot of collaboration for the

00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,640
developers to be like oh wait a minute

00:23:57,279 --> 00:24:00,640
like we could pull all of this

00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:02,000
firmographic data from the javascript

00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,679
tracking object

00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,440
and marketing was just like oh my gosh

00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:06,960
we already have an audience built around

00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:09,120
that like that's perfect

00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,960
that's a great idea of like how that

00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:12,080
stuff can work together and

00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:13,840
you know i've got a whole list of other

00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,400
examples i'd be happy to dig into but

00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:16,559
we'll

00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:18,080
we'll save those for the end um yeah

00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:19,840
just to keep things moving

00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:21,440
along and looks like we got a quick

00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:23,840
question here too that

00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,799
about personalization so um james is

00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,720
asking

00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:29,520
with the drupal personalization module

00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:31,440
example are you using drupal to deliver

00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:33,360
through things like snapchat are you

00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:35,840
able to use drupal sort of like a

00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:37,760
headless cms that way

00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,880
that's a good question i i don't

00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:41,840
actually

00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:43,440
know the specifics of some of the social

00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:44,720
campaigns i think christina can you

00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:47,760
speak at all to like

00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:51,520
how they're managing the content like

00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:54,720
sort of on those external sources

00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:58,159
yeah i would say that from i

00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:59,039
we haven't done a smart content to

00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:02,400
snapchat

00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:04,640
um actual integration

00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,520
yet nick not to my knowledge or tick

00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:09,520
tock

00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:12,960
but um from from more of a serving up of

00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:15,600
content or at least like what is on uh

00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:17,120
snapchat or tick tock it's simply

00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:20,240
directing them to

00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:23,120
content within the site that is based on

00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:25,520
um what is being uh served up on

00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:28,000
snapchat i know that's a little vague

00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:29,760
um james you're you're asking some

00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,559
really good questions here

00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:33,679
but um the technical specifics there i

00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:36,799
could um

00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:39,279
probably dig in a little deeper for sure

00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:40,240
yeah and i mean like on on the drupal

00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:42,159
side like

00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:44,320
all of the content that's part of the

00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:45,520
campaign is definitely managed in drupal

00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:48,159
so i mean i think

00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:49,600
you know like with the utm parameters

00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:51,279
like we can look for those parameters

00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:53,279
with drupal we can manage sort of the

00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:54,159
default and the personalized content in

00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:56,000
drupal

00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:58,320
the one piece that isn't connected into

00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,320
drupal in that example i think

00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:01,679
is like the actual content that's

00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:04,640
getting pushed out

00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:07,039
to snapchat right so you know there is

00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:09,279
still definitely opportunity for

00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:11,200
more integration there but you know

00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:12,640
agility let's focus on you know getting

00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,640
things pushed out quickly

00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:16,000
and uh you know iterate on that over

00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:18,480
time yeah

00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,440
james is giving us some ideas for our

00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:23,600
next release

00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:24,880
right nick yeah yeah i know seriously

00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:27,360
um and i guess while we're in

00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:29,360
personalization got a question from

00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:31,200
matt here we're using a personalization

00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:32,559
platform from one of the major drupal

00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:34,720
partners what sets the drupal

00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:36,559
personalization module

00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:38,400
apart from some of the other offerings

00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:40,400
out there from third party services

00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,440
um i can take that one if that's cool

00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:44,480
with you christina

00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:46,480
yeah so yeah so the module specifically

00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:48,320
we're talking about is smart content

00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:49,760
um it's you know we're happy to like dig

00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:51,440
more into the details of that like it's

00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:53,760
an open source project that

00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:55,600
um our team at elevated third maintains

00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:56,480
and i think the main thing that sets it

00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:58,400
apart is

00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:00,080
just like how quickly you can get up and

00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,480
running with it so you know like i said

00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,840
it's

00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,520
it's a drupal module that you can

00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:05,200
install and like out of the box you can

00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:06,320
do things like the utm parameter

00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:09,440
customization

00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:10,880
um cookie based customization

00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,559
and a few other kind of like

00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:13,840
browser-based options for things you

00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:15,600
might not think of as like

00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,960
traditional personalization just in the

00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,640
sense of you know you can personalize

00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:20,960
based on like mobile devices and things

00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:23,360
like that and um you know it's

00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:25,440
out of the box it's not going to be as

00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:27,360
robust as maybe like you know what you

00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,679
might get out of aqua personalization

00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,360
which

00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:30,720
you know i think it's just about like

00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:32,159
the use case because with awkward

00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:33,760
personalization you're getting the whole

00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:34,000
like tracking back in and everything

00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,000
like

00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,039
that where with smart content you're

00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,080
integrating that

00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:42,080
with other tools so um i think

00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:44,000
you know to sum that up into a briefer

00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:45,600
answer it's just like it's it's quick to

00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,799
use it's free to get up and running and

00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:49,360
it integrates

00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:50,799
directly into drupal and um actually i

00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:52,320
can throw a link to it in the chat

00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:55,279
too real quick here in just a second if

00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:57,760
anyone's interested i know we are

00:27:55,279 --> 00:28:00,159
naked oh yeah well actually another

00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:03,039
important comment from the client and

00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:04,799
is it's relatively low risk right you

00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:05,960
said we're able to kind of get things up

00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:08,880
and running

00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:12,080
integration-wise but a lot of these uh

00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:15,279
third-party platforms they are a

00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:16,640
larger lift right to get going so if

00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:19,120
you're starting

00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:20,640
to think through personalization how do

00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,679
you want to approach it from a strategy

00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:24,480
standpoint

00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:25,600
nick reference crawl off run this is

00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:28,240
definitely an

00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:30,480
area where you can start testing and

00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:33,760
seeing what works and seeing how

00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:36,880
workflow um on the marketing end

00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:38,399
moves into the actual execution of a

00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:40,240
personalization campaign

00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:42,080
so it's a great way to start testing

00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:44,159
that out um

00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:45,279
and seeing what's going to work best for

00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:47,840
your users and

00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:47,840
it's quick

00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:52,720
um and i know we're getting close on

00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:54,399
time we've got a couple more questions

00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:58,159
here so christina i say we

00:28:54,399 --> 00:29:00,000
prioritize questions over uh

00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:01,360
everything else what do you say that

00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,919
sounds good yeah

00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:04,559
all right so just scrolling back up i

00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:06,240
know

00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:07,760
josh said i find personalization a

00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:10,320
little creepy i keep wondering if we're

00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:12,159
building tools for violating privacy

00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:13,520
should we allow customers to opt in to

00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:14,799
being put in funnels rather than

00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:16,480
guessing and i think

00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:18,320
that's that's a super interesting

00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:19,679
question that i mean we could spend an

00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:22,640
entire session

00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:23,200
on that alone and i mean it's a great

00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:25,360
point

00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,960
that you know i think like we are

00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:28,880
talking mostly about anonymous

00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:30,799
personalization and like

00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:32,080
you know i think we always try to strike

00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:33,360
that balance where you know when we're

00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:35,440
working with our clients to build

00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:38,080
personalization campaigns where

00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:40,320
you know we don't want to like go too

00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:42,320
deep and do things

00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:43,760
get the weather for their address and

00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:45,200
you know maybe say something about how

00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,559
the weather is or like you know use

00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,840
their name directly in there i think

00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:49,840
we're talking about

00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:52,159
things that we can know more generally

00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:55,520
from data that

00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:56,640
it isn't pii in the sense well it's it's

00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:58,720
not pii

00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:01,039
um you know but i mean obviously like

00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:02,399
when we're talking about gdpr and ccpa i

00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:03,279
think you know this is data that would

00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:05,440
be

00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:06,799
tied into that kind of depending on the

00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:08,159
interpretation of the company that

00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:08,720
you're working with so i mean i think

00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:10,240
it's

00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:12,000
it's a sensitive issue for sure and i

00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:13,440
think something that

00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,720
you know we are always trying to take

00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,679
into account i think all marketers

00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:17,520
should take into account with

00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:19,600
personalization that like you know you

00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:21,039
you want it to be helpful but not sort

00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:23,039
of like creepy

00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:24,240
and and overbearing i don't know

00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:24,640
anything you'd add on to that christina

00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:27,919
yeah

00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:30,720
i almost think um that if

00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:32,240
it comes off creepy you're not doing it

00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:34,399
the right way because i think

00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:35,520
personalization is on has undergone a

00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:38,480
makeover right

00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:39,039
the the weather in denver the weather in

00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:41,039
raleigh

00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:42,640
up in the right-hand corner in the menu

00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:43,360
bar right that's what we've been used to

00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:47,120
seeing are like

00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:50,399
hello nick hello christina um hello josh

00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:51,279
that is where we're seeing a shift away

00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:53,440
from that

00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:54,480
and really the personalized experience

00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:57,840
is meant to

00:30:54,480 --> 00:31:01,039
enhance that journey from a user

00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:02,799
so let's say that you are i'll take

00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:05,840
myself for an example

00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:06,799
about to be 30 year old black woman i've

00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:10,000
been searching

00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:13,279
i've been searching for a new car

00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:16,960
i go onto a banking website

00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:20,000
and in the hero banner is a cta

00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:20,799
that's talking about loans for uh car

00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,600
payments

00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:24,080
things like that that are very should be

00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:27,120
very

00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:30,720
subtle but in the context of

00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:34,240
what the user is um interacting with

00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:37,440
on their journey so the better that the

00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:39,679
um strategy is executed it should feel a

00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:41,760
little less like big brother and like

00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:43,200
freaky out but that's a really good

00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:45,440
point josh because that's

00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:49,200
that's definitely what the landscape has

00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:49,200
looked like in the past for sure

00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:56,640
and you just loaded with insights

00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:58,320
love it um all right so i know we're at

00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:00,080
time i think we can run a few more

00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:02,159
minutes without getting shut down

00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:04,000
so i just wanted to make sure we get to

00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:04,960
the one last question that andrew asked

00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,159
in here because i think it's a really

00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:08,080
good one and i think you'll have some

00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:10,640
good insight on this christina and

00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:12,640
what he said is any suggestions on how

00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:14,399
to communicate and evaluate the benefits

00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:15,600
and complexity of each additional

00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:18,720
integration

00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:20,480
in a dxp with marketers one common

00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,200
challenge is working with marketers who

00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,519
want to add

00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:24,880
one more integration but the technical

00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:25,760
overhead is more than a single

00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:27,600
integration

00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:29,039
due to the web of all integrations you

00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:30,320
have to manage over time sounds like

00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:32,080
andrew's been doing this for a while

00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:33,919
this sounds very familiar

00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:36,399
no andrew that's a really good point

00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:38,080
because um even leaning into

00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:40,159
how we were gonna rap before you all

00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:44,000
started asking some really good

00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:46,159
questions here i think that there is

00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,440
sometimes an audit that's a little bit

00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:50,159
necessary

00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:51,360
um marketers oftentimes don't know what

00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:53,840
they don't know

00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:55,600
and that's where the collaboration with

00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:57,679
the dev and tech side becomes

00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:59,679
increasingly important right

00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:00,880
uh you have marketing uh team members

00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:03,360
that are coming to you

00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:05,760
asking for x y and z integration but

00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:08,720
they often don't have the visibility

00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:10,720
of capabilities that already exist

00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:14,480
within the their stack

00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:15,600
right and how can you all kind of work

00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:17,679
together

00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:18,880
and sometimes it's a crossover of

00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:20,799
education

00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:24,000
um giving them a breakdown of what

00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:26,720
functionality and features already exist

00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,760
and then deciding is the juice really

00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:31,519
worth the squeeze

00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:34,640
right um a little bit of a weird jargon

00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:37,120
there as well but um yeah no i think

00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:39,360
that um andrew we do that every day too

00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:41,279
like our collaboration with our lead

00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:43,039
developers on our team

00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:46,080
and then being liaisons between the

00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:50,159
client of is it really necessary to have

00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:52,960
you know now the we need a new chat

00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:54,000
feature in order for our existing chat

00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:56,880
feature to do

00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,919
x and i think that's when really

00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:00,799
discussing

00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:02,159
and having the conversation becomes

00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:04,399
really important

00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:06,559
and even sometimes just understanding

00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:09,599
what that level of effort looks like

00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:11,280
and that transparency um

00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:12,960
you know you'll see a lot of marketing

00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:15,839
team members probably be like okay

00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:17,760
well it's not that that much of a um

00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:20,159
important piece to add

00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:20,879
um but yeah no that's a fantastic point

00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:25,520
i think

00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:28,879
communicating is very key there

00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:32,480
yep definitely um well i know

00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:35,839
we're about out of time um christina

00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:37,839
32nd closing words yeah

00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:39,520
how do how does everybody leave here and

00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:41,119
make this happen tomorrow what's what's

00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:43,119
the first step how do we get going

00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:44,480
yeah i feel like i'm gonna unlock the

00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:47,839
keys to the kingdom right

00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:49,280
but i think we started we started with

00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:51,919
simplification right

00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:53,359
let's simplify and break things down

00:34:51,919 --> 00:34:55,919
kind of break out of these

00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:56,879
stodgy terms that we're using but when

00:34:55,919 --> 00:35:00,720
you look at

00:34:56,879 --> 00:35:03,760
the word mark right what is

00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:06,960
what comes first mark marketing

00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:09,920
and tech close follow and

00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:12,079
what what we're seeing is if we let the

00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:15,040
marketing side of things

00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:17,520
come first and be that driving force

00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:18,320
behind the solutions and that selection

00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,920
process

00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:22,560
the tech side of things is very

00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:24,400
important as well and when we see both

00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:25,359
of those sides of the business working

00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:27,839
together

00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:30,400
owning their areas of expertise you

00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:32,720
truly see that symbiotic relationship

00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:34,240
that results in a really healthy

00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:36,640
and effective digital marketing

00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:39,520
ecosystem

00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:41,040
very simple right i love it i love it i

00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:42,640
love it that's great and

00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:45,359
yeah i think we'll wrap up by just

00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:48,480
thanking everyone for coming

00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:49,839
um we will be around the elevated third

00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:51,680

00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,920
like 30 minutes of drupalcon 2021 with
