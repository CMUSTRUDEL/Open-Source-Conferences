for their keynote session school needs

00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,920
open source

00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:05,840
now more than ever stu is a social

00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:08,479
studies and technology teacher

00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,000
in minnesota where he founded two middle

00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:11,760
school linux clubs

00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,520
he spent the last 10 years teaching

00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,720
middle school students how to close the

00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:18,000
digital divide

00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:20,720
through open source to date stu and his

00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,600
students have distributed over 600 linux

00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,080
computers

00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,960
helping kids learn and saving schools

00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:28,960
money at the same time

00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,720
when their school shut down due to covid

00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,640
in march of 2020

00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,320
the school needed this team to close the

00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,040
digital divide

00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,560

source to make a positive impact

mr stukarov

00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:43,519
thank you for having us back hello

00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:46,239
i'm stu karev the first computer

00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:47,680
i ever saw was an apple ii at my

00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:49,519
elementary school

00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,800
i'm dating myself now but it was the

00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:53,360
late 70s

00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,480
it didn't even belong to the school it

00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,040
belonged to the school

00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:59,280
district and each school in the district

00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:02,400
would get to borrow it for a few weeks

00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:04,080
the individual experience for any kid at

00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,560
my school with that machine was

00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,760
pretty brief and nobody had a computer

00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,159
in their home

00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:12,159
way out of reach for most families

00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:13,200
things were a little better in the 80s

00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:15,760
when my high school

00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,680
had a computer lab of apple twos but

00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,760
computers were still too expensive for

00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:22,400
most families like mine

00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,879
the late 90s and early 2000s brought a

00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,480
lot of

00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:27,200
changes with the explosion of the

00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:29,120
internet and affordability of computers

00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,720
my wife and i would pick up used

00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:33,519
computers from people who were

00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,159
upgrading and we saved up to buy our

00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:37,599
first

00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:39,680
new computer in 2002 i was starting back

00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:42,239
to school to get my teacher's license

00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,599
and it took all the money we had just to

00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:45,920
get the computer

00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:47,280
we had nothing left over to get

00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:49,599
microsoft office

00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,480
and i was going to need software for

00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,720
school

00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,480
no problem i thought there was a sales

00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,720
promotion going on at work

00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,760
i would get a bonus and then i could buy

00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,239
it well

00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,360
the end of the promotion came but my

00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:05,280
sales did not

00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:07,680
and it did not get the extra money great

00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,480
what then i needed to be able to write

00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,640
papers and

00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,319
had no software to do it with so i

00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,000
called up a friend of mine who worked in

00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:16,320
tech and asked him if he

00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,400
could let me have a copy of open office

00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,560
that we could install on my computer

00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,840
knowing that i was asking him to cheat a

00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,240
little bit

00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:26,240
he said instead of just instead of just

00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:29,360
driving over to my house with a disc

00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:31,280
he said why don't you try open office

00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,639
it's open source and you can get it for

00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:35,759
free

00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:37,360
open source i had heard that term before

00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:40,320
in an article about this thing called

00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:42,160
linux but i wasn't familiar with using

00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:44,479
anything released under an open source

00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,520
license i went to the open office

00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:47,440
website

00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:50,240
read a little bit about it downloaded

00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:54,240
the program and hoped for the best

00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:57,280
and my eyes were opened this program

00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,000
even in its early version was great i

00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,400
could write

00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,759
papers i could make slideshows i could

00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,680
complete classwork

00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:05,120
it was just what i needed and

00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,280
programmers out there

00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,880
somewhere had collaborated together to

00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:11,680
make it and give it away

00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,479
so folks like me could use it this was

00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,280
truly

00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:16,080
transformative technology because i

00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,520
could

00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:20,320
because it could help people with

00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:22,880
limited resources get what they needed

00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,160
while i was attending school i continued

00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,680
to use openoffice

00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,840
and they continued to improve the

00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,720
program i would even take

00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:32,240
download files and burn them to cds so i

00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,360
could give them to people who needed

00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,240
software

00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,720
this open source idea was amazing i

00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,960
could get

00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,880
good software from people who were

00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,160
making it just because they wanted to

00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,800
share their ideas

00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,520
and their code i didn't have to pirate

00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,840
software

00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:49,120
or go to bill gates with my handouts

00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:52,479
like oliver twist

00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:55,919
saying please sir i want some more

00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:56,639
i was hooked later i started to use

00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:59,520
linux

00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:01,360
and it became a hobby until i saw that

00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,160
the versions i used had gotten good

00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,680
enough

00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,600
and that i had learned enough about

00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,800
using them for linux to become my daily

00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,479
driver

00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,319
then i made a point of doing as much of

00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:12,960
my teacher work as possible

00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:14,319
using linux rather than the windows

00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:18,240
computer

00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:20,880
my school issued me to me the idea of

00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,400
of a school using open source software

00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:25,520
was a no-brainer

00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,080
no school has unlimited money linux was

00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,000
free

00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:29,600
and it could help you get more life out

00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,960
of older computers

00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:35,600
why wouldn't they use it what i found

00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:37,360
was that there's this huge gulf between

00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,120
the world of open source and the world

00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,880
of public education

00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,520
you're all familiar with venn diagrams

00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:45,280
right two overlapping circles compare

00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:48,319
and contrast

00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:50,319
this slide represents a venn diagram

00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:52,560
showing the relationship between open

00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:55,120
source and public education

00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,160
as you can see the circles do not

00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,160
overlap

00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,759
they don't even touch they just sit

00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,599
there next to each other with no having

00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:03,440
no relationship at all

00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:04,639
these worlds have nothing to do with

00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:07,919
each other

00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:09,919
this never made sense to me why is this

00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:11,360
it's not like schools and students don't

00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:14,319
need technology

00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,520
they do it's not like open source can't

00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:19,120
help schools with

00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:20,319
great solutions it can we can discuss a

00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:23,120
bunch of reasons

00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:25,280
but the end result is the gulf exists

00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:28,160
and there are very few exceptions

00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:29,360
but the idea of open collaboration and

00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:33,039
sharing with everybody

00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:36,319
stuck with me open source had helped me

00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:38,319
what about other people i wasn't a coder

00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:40,080
but could i take what i had learned

00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:41,199
about open source and use it to help

00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:44,160
others

00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:46,319
the answer was yes since i was a teacher

00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,360
the most logical place to start was at

00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:50,639
school

00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:52,240
i founded the first two school linux

00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,000
clubs in minnesota

00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,400
the community school of excellence asian

00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,360
penguins and the aspen academy penguin

00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,000
corps

00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,840
both programs started from kids having

00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,919
fun learning something new

00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,360
and both ended up using open source to

00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:07,919
help people

00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:10,160
first the asian penguins at community

00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:12,639
school of excellence in saint paul

00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:14,160
they were the start of an experiment get

00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:17,199
open source software

00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:19,840
get used computers have kids do the work

00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:22,080
and see what happens the results of the

00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:25,520
experiment are in

00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:26,000
this works having kids using open source

00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,240
in school

00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,919
helps the kids helps the school and

00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,640
helps the community

00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:34,800
the asian penguins started in 2011 when

00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,000
i got some linux desktop computers for

00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,000
my classroom

00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,080
the kids loved the computers and started

00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,560
coming to my room after school to use

00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,959
them

00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:44,080
the kids were asian the mascot of linux

00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:46,959
was a penguin

00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,760
and so the asian penguins was born the

00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:50,560
five or six

00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:53,279
kids who started became a movement that

00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,880
eventually included over 250 student

00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:57,680
members over eight years

00:08:54,880 --> 00:09:00,320
with the club impacting hundreds more by

00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:03,519
recycling and giving away computers

00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:06,560
in 2019 i came to aspen academy

00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:09,120
and continued the experiment i had said

00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,720
any school could do this so now it was

00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:13,360
time to prove it

00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,080
i started a new club to learn about open

00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,240
source

00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,120
the penguin course started with 14

00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,399
students

00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:22,640
and at last count we are at almost 50

00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:23,519
and we have impacted hundreds more by

00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:26,080
refurbishing

00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:27,600
old computers for students the way it

00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:30,880
works is this

00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:33,920
open source software plus use computers

00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:37,200
plus enthusiastic kids equals more

00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:38,720
students learn and it all started from a

00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:41,040
pretty simple idea

00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,320
get kids using open source and see what

00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,080
happens

00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,640
now it's time to let the kids tell the

00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:48,839
story thank you very much

00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:51,839
up first from the students is ethan

00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:51,839
tanega

00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:01,519
hi i'm ethan tanega as you hear maya say

00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,920
we are trying to change the world

00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:04,640
what happens when you try sometimes you

00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,800
succeed

00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,560
let me tell you about it in the penguin

00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,399
court we have weekly meetings on

00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:12,079
wednesdays before school

00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:13,760
at those meetings we select the leader

00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:14,880
to be the master of ceremonies and get

00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,800
things going

00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,800
we always started off the same way the

00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,720
leader asked us what are we trying to do

00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,079
your spot they changed the world then

00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,480
the leader asked how do you change the

00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,079
world

00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:26,320
you reply be crazy enough to think you

00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:27,519
can that gets things started off on a

00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,880
positive note

00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,640
and we're excited about wherever we're

00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,079
going we're learning that morning

00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,480
lesson started for us with learning how

00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:35,040
to install software that isn't just the

00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,519
apps

00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:39,519
but also the operating system itself and

00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:41,360
doing it in linux is very different from

00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:43,279
doing it in windows

00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,360
most of these computers we work on were

00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:47,920
about to be sent to a recycler

00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,920
linux we revived them they are currently

00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,760
in classrooms at our school and used by

00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,880
hundreds of students during distance

00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,640
learning

00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,800
some of the lessons we use came from the

00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:58,720
floss desktops for kids curriculum from

00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,480
the open source initiative

00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,160
it has a lot of good ideas that really

00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,399
work for us its author

00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,600
patrick messon wanted to see schools

00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:07,440
have a resource

00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,800
for doing this kind of stuff we

00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,040
recommend it

00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,880
most people today thinking installing

00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,240
software means simply clicking a button

00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,760
that says install

00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,160
well that can be done in the linux world

00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:20,320
too but we found it was more fun to open

00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:22,079
up a terminal window and type commands

00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,519
in fact all the members of the penguin

00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:25,360
core learned how to do this

00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,120
we never made a requirement because

00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,600
everyone wanted to do it anyways

00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:31,279
i enjoy it too as i mentioned

00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,880
refurbished computers

00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:34,560
work on old computers that either the

00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,000
school didn't want anymore or that

00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,519
people gave to us

00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,120
most of those computers were placed with

00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:41,200
kids that didn't have one

00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,480
you're learning more about this from cam

00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,800
but here's a preview

00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:47,360
we closed our school's digital divide we

00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:49,519
also provided computers for our school

00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:51,279
we set up full classroom sets of laptops

00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:53,760
for a few middle school classrooms

00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:54,720
and station sets for several elementary

00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,240
classrooms

00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,320
along with putting computers in the

00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:01,120
school media center also

00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,639
lots of kids were helped this year when

00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,680
our school went to distance learning and

00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:06,240
hybrid learning

00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:07,200
more computer computers were needed for

00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,120
kids at home

00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:11,440
you provided those too along with

00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,959
keeping a steady supply of laptops for

00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,320
the office just in case something needed

00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:15,680
to be replaced

00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,519
even though there have been times when

00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:19,600
the school is closed and converted

00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:21,680
distance learning due to cover 19

00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,200
we still try to stay together as a team

00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,959
by meeting over zoom

00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,959
from there you want to present at

00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:28,800
conferences just like this one

00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:30,560
and started the youtube channel feel

00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,880
free to subscribe to us

00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:33,680
you know what they say all work no play

00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,600
right

00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,959
we end each session at penguin court by

00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,279
having a huge party

00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:40,320
and playing fun video games and be a lot

00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:42,240
of snacks

00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,320
well you might be asking what impact did

00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,920
we have for starters many of our

00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,040
teachers didn't know how to check out

00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,480
computer cards

00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,880
because they have their own computers in

00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,160
their room argued school's linux user

00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,959
base grown from zero

00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:57,519
to hundreds of students we're learning

00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:59,040
new tech skills and having fun

00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:00,800
let's not forget we closed our school's

00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,440
digital divide at a time when we really

00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,200
needed it

00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:07,839
thank you for listening coming up next

00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:07,839
is obama

00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,800
good afternoon my name is and i'd like

00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,320
to give a shout out to all of the women

00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,360
who have presented at this conference

00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:26,560
this week

00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:29,519
thanks for what you do okay i'll be fair

00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:30,959
thanks to the guys too everyone watching

00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:32,800
today is here because you have a

00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:35,360
connection to technology

00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,320
we all do and tech can be exciting but

00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,240
if we're honest

00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:40,639
we'll admit that the open source world

00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:43,040
is not as diverse as it could be

00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:44,160
the history of technology is mainly a

00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:46,480
story about men

00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:48,000
with few of those being men of color

00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,320
nothing is wrong with those guys doing

00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,079
tech it's just that it's not a very

00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:54,000
diverse picture

00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:55,199
while this is true it helps to remember

00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,519
that there were some women

00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:59,839
who were trailblazers and tech and were

00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:02,079
great leaders and great heroes

00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,920
how about admiral grace hopper one of

00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:05,839
the earliest computer programmers

00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,519
there's also catherine johnson dorothy

00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:09,440
vaughan and mary jackson

00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:11,839
who helped nasa put astronauts into

00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,480
space you may have seen their history in

00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:15,440
the movie

00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:16,240
hidden figures some of my classmates in

00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,920
fifth grade

00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,920
profiled those three during black

00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:21,920
history month

00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,440
role models may have been rare but they

00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,279
did exist

00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,880
that brings us to today where

00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,760
ninety-five percent of text and open

00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,600
source are male

00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:31,120
and only sixteen percent are members of

00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:34,079
minority groups

00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:35,440
we do have room to grow when the penguin

00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:37,600
core started at our school

00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,199
mr keroff and the school leaders wanted

00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,720
to make sure the door was open to all

00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:42,480
middle school students

00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,000
could a middle school linux club become

00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,639
a diverse place

00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,000
the answer is yes that question had

00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:50,880
already been answered that

00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,079
by a club that came before us that club

00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,760
is the asian penguins

00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:55,600
at community school of excellence in

00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:57,360
saint paul minnesota

00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,199
the asian penguins make a deliberate

00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:01,839
effort to attract

00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:03,839
students of diverse backgrounds and both

00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:05,760
boys and girls

00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:08,160
as a result it is multicultural and

00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:11,279
their team is 30 to 50 percent girls

00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:12,000
in any given year the penguin core is

00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:14,959
now in its second

00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
year and i'm happy to report the efforts

00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:19,199
have paid off

00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,160
as of right now our team has 49 members

00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:22,320
we have students who are

00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:25,600
african-american biracial

00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:29,199
egyptian ethiopian filipino ghanaian

00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:32,000
haitian hispanic indian kenyan somali

00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:34,079
tanzanian and white from all over europe

00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,839
with a total of 18 girls

00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:40,160
folks that's 37 what attracted all of

00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:41,839
these students to the penguin core

00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:43,759
we enjoy learning about the world that

00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:45,920
is developing right in front of us

00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:48,079
we learn that everyone can make a change

00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:50,000
in the world that is still yet to come

00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:52,160
in penguin core we all work together as

00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,600
a team we are united in a way that we

00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,440
think everyone should be

00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,880
we have a chance to make a bright future

00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,759
for the world ahead of us

00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:00,880
so let's embrace that chance we have

00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:03,759
boys and girls

00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:04,240
deliver computers to classrooms boys and

00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:06,000
girls

00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:08,079
learn to install linux and open source

00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,040
apps boys and girls troubleshoot

00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:10,720
problems

00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:12,959
we all help each other to embrace our

00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,639
differences and change the world

00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:16,560
now that the elementary kids see the

00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:18,079
example we set they know the penguin

00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:20,320
chords for everybody

00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:22,000
and since we all work together we girls

00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:25,360
are always ready to offer the boys

00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,360
a helping hand when they get stuck

00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:31,120
if a kid's come club can be a diverse

00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,480
and welcoming place why can't the rest

00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:34,839
of the open source world

00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:36,399
let's all invite welcome recognize and

00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:38,959

we are all equal and we are all united

00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:42,160
in the open source world

00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:51,839
thank you very much now please welcome

00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:51,839
kam strawski

00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:56,399
hi i'm kam satrowski penguin corp

00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,360
president i hope by now you've gotten

00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:59,360
the point that this is

00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:01,120
not something we do but something that

00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:03,199
we believe in

00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,240
the last year the kova 19 pandemic has

00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:06,079
affected schools

00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:08,000
all over the world including where we

00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:09,919
are schools

00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,360
in minnesota were converted to distance

00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:13,199
learning that's where teachers provide

00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:14,640
lessons online and kids went to school

00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:17,679
in their homes over the internet

00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:19,760
it was a huge change while it was tough

00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:20,319
going to school for my bedroom or dining

00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,480
room

00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:24,240
at least i had a computer to use but

00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:25,760
what about the kids at school who didn't

00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,280
have computers or the families who

00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,559
didn't have enough computers for all the

00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:31,039
kids in the house

00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:32,480
what were they supposed to do so the

00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:33,919
people in charge of our school reached

00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,880
out to the penguin corps to create a

00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:36,640
solution

00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:38,240
the first thing we needed to do was to

00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,160
survey the parents so we knew which

00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:41,120
family needed a computer and which did

00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,360
not

00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:45,840
we used information we collected and got

00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:47,440
to work we started by putting linux on

00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:49,120
computers the school didn't want anymore

00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:52,960
so they could be given to families

00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:55,440
who needed them then we gave those away

00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:57,360
more responses started to pour in we

00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:59,360
realized that the supply we had would

00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:01,840
not even be close to enough

00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:04,480
this became a serious problem that was

00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:06,720
in dire need of a bigger solution

00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,679
once we realized that we started to ask

00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,440
for more

00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:11,760
mr cara for the school reached out over

00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:13,200
social media and in the local newspaper

00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,640
asking people to donate their old

00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,240
computers to us

00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,160
we used open source software to make

00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,760
them usable again a whole bunch of

00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,480
people and even some businesses

00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:23,200
responded

00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:24,880
laptops started to pour in most of them

00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,760
worked but some need minor repairs such

00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:28,799
as new batteries

00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:29,440
a charger or a hard drive all of the

00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:31,520
computers

00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:33,600
needed new software linux and open

00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:35,440
source apps were the solution

00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,280
we got the computers up and running

00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,640
tested them and left them at the school

00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:40,480
to give away

00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:42,240
prior to the shutdown the pagan core had

00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:44,720
given away

00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:46,720
six computers from march 16th to the

00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,679
first week of may we gave away 60

00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,440
computers

00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:51,600
this effectively closed the digital

00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:54,320
divide we had at the time

00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:55,679
as aspen used an asynchronous model for

00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,679
classes

00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:59,280
allowing siblings to share computers at

00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:01,280
home it worked

00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:03,039
aspen had intended to have face-to-face

00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,679
instruction when school started in the

00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:05,360
fall

00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:07,919
but last minute we were told that we had

00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:09,440
to go hybrid with some kids going coming

00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:11,600
to school on monday

00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,640
and tuesday and others coming thursday

00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,880
and friday

00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:17,039
when kids were at home they were now to

00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,880
attend classes online at the same time

00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:20,720
as students in the building

00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:22,080
this meant that every student now needed

00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:25,039
a device

00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:26,720
and demand went way up again we appealed

00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:27,520
online through social media to get

00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,200
donations

00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,960
we bought used computers from the mn

00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,240
surplus exchange where we could get them

00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,840
cheap

00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,520
then the school started to hand them out

00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,480
it was a bigger job that anyone could

00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,240
have predicted

00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,640
at our open house in august we handed

00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:43,679
out 132 laptops and it

00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:44,559
still wasn't enough we compiled the

00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:46,480
waiting list

00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:48,640
and continued to get computers ready

00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:50,240
giving them out in a steady stream over

00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:52,880
the next few weeks

00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:53,840
finally by october we got the last kid

00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:57,360
on our list

00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:59,840
we had handed out over 300 computers

00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:01,600
what did this cost most of the computers

00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,080
were donated and we had to buy some

00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,559
parts

00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:06,480
the biggest couples cost was buying

00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:10,320
refurbished computers from the state

00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:12,320
they were a fraction of buying new

00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:14,000
as of right now our total cost is still

00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:15,600
under six thousand dollars we estimate

00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,280
that we saved our school over ninety

00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:19,520
thousand dollars

00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,720
during this time the schools across the

00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,480
country

00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,919
struggled with supply line problems

00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,960
which delayed the delivery of their

00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:26,960
computers per month

00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,000
with open source software we closed our

00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,440
digital divide

00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,280
helped our students and teachers and

00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:33,120
saved a pile of money it

00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:34,559
can be done it's possible to make a

00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:37,760
hashtag trend on in there

00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:38,480
let's find out oh ready put this on

00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,400
twitter

00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:49,120
thank you for listening i'm camzatrowski

00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:51,280
coming up next is ethan mcguire

00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:52,240
hello my name is ethan mcgorr and i'm

00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,600
glad you came

00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:55,039
you've heard my friends talk about what

00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:57,120
they like about the penguin car but they

00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:58,559
missed one of my favorite things

00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:01,120
when you're in the penguin court every

00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:02,720
once in a while you get to skip class

00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:04,559
of course to get permission to do this

00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:06,000
open source stuff at school means that

00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:07,280
we have to convince our school leaders

00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,720
that it's a good idea

00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:10,720
this means that sometimes we have to

00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,840
turn on the charm i hope you're feeling

00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,440
persuadable

00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,960
you've heard my team talk about how we

00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:17,039
use open source at school

00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:18,960
and i'd like to talk about why i would

00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:21,360
like to give you some reasons why

00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:22,000
you should start linux start a linux

00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,840
club

00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,440
some of you might ask why do schools

00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,799
need something like that or say that's

00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,799
not the kind of thing for me

00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:30,480
well we believe that any school can do

00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:30,880
this but that school might need your

00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,720
help

00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:34,320
let's talk about some reasons the

00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,919
program is affordable

00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,600
all the software is free and you're

00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:39,600
using old computers

00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,960
so you don't have to pay a lot for them

00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,960
something else to keep in mind

00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,400
people like to help kids when they hear

00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,760
you're running a club that has kids

00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,360
recycling computers

00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,880
they will give you computers remember

00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:50,880
what cam talked about

00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:52,559
and when you fundraise for a linux club

00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,039
people like to give you money to support

00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:55,840
it

00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:57,280
linux runs great on old computers we use

00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:59,520
it to bring

00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:01,520
computers back to life this not only

00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:03,120
saves money but it reduces e-waste and

00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:05,360
the last time i checked this country

00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:07,440
produces too much e-waste

00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:09,280
you get to help people in a variety of

00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:11,679
ways you help kids learn

00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:13,360
analytics we learn how to do all this

00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:15,600
stuff we learn how to install

00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:16,720
software fix computers update and

00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,720
upgrade computers

00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:21,200
and all sorts of other skills these are

00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:24,159
in demand skills according to the 2018

00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,880
open source jobs report from the linux

00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:27,919
foundation

00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:30,000
83 percent of hiring managers said that

00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:32,880
that open source talent was important to

00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,480
them and 87 percent of them said it was

00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36,640
hard to find qualified help

00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:38,240
numbers like that speak for themselves

00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,960
you help people who are outside of the

00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,799
school

00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,559
if your school doesn't need computers

00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:43,440
lots of your school's families probably

00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:45,600
do

00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:47,120
that was certainly the case for us and

00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:49,919
remember when you give a

00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:51,600
computer to old computer to a kid you're

00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:53,919
helping the family too

00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:56,000
you help the school itself the penguin

00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:57,600
corps refurbished enough laptops to help

00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,280
hundreds of kids in their home during

00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,799
distance and hybrid learning

00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:02,880
now that we're back in the building

00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:04,720
we're using those laptops to help

00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,240
several classrooms since those teachers

00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,600
have their own laptop sets

00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,280
they don't need to check our school's

00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,480
computer cards leaving them for other

00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:12,720
teachers to use

00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:14,320
we also provided desktop computers to

00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:16,960
some classrooms in our

00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:17,840
medias and our media center everybody

00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,679
benefits

00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:21,120
it's fun that should be a good enough

00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:23,039
reason for anybody

00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:24,480
and when you're refurbishing computers

00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:27,280
or teaching at conferences

00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:28,400
you're not in class as you can see there

00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,720
are lots of reasons

00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:32,960
why a school should have an open source

00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:35,280
club it's affordable people get help

00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:36,720
and kids have fun and folks three out of

00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:38,480
three ain't bad

00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:40,080
coming up next is michael martin thank

00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:43,120
you for listening and please consider

00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:43,120
yourself persuaded

00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:52,640
hello i'm michael martin so i guess why

00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:56,720
we're doing hashtags now

00:23:52,640 --> 00:24:00,480
well i came prepared michael

00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:03,039
sorry mr karaf how about this

00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:04,640
much better we started off by saying

00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:06,720
that schools need open source

00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:08,000
open source well the open source world

00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,679
needs schools too

00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,440
what do you think future it

00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:14,159
professionals are right now

00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:16,159
they're in class the open source world

00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:17,279
and education world do not intersect

00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:19,520
very often

00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:21,120
and if we change that we change

00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,640
everything

00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:24,720
you can be part of the solution by

00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,600
opening an open source program where you

00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,760
are

00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,960
if ethan mcguire did his job properly

00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:30,320
and persuaded you

00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:33,200
here are some things you'll need to get

00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:35,520
started one a supervisor

00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:37,760
this could easily be you you just have

00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:39,360
to be willing to try something new

00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:41,279
it's possible that you have the tech

00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:43,440
skills but need to

00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:44,480
learn how to teach it to kids the good

00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:47,600
news is

00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:49,679
you can learn how to do that two the

00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:51,360
go-ahead from the administration

00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:53,120
each school has a different way of doing

00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:55,440
activities find out who

00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:57,279
works there and put it into your plan

00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,960
more likely than not if your school has

00:24:57,279 --> 00:24:59,440
clubs they're looking for more ideas for

00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,360
clubs

00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:03,279
and more adults to run them make

00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:06,080
yourself available

00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:07,760
three computers remember they don't have

00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:10,240
to be new ones

00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:12,640
four software your computers will need

00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,919
an operating system and apps

00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:16,240
if you're using linux then you're

00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:19,600
getting your software for free

00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:24,000
that really helps five

00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:26,960
kids that's kind of the whole point

00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:29,279
six space and time a club will need a

00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:30,799
place to meet up and to keep its stuff

00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:32,320
and club activities will have to fit

00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:34,000
into the schedule

00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:35,440
work with the local administration to

00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,919
figure that out

00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:39,120
not sure how to start tip one start

00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:41,360
small

00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:42,799
use linux yourself i bet most of you

00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:45,120
already do

00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:46,880
a couple of resources you could use

00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:48,240
would include the floss desktop for kids

00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,200
curriculum from the open source

00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:52,080
initiative

00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:53,120
we use some of their lessons another is

00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:55,840
the linux club guide

00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:57,840
written by our oh very own mr kirov the

00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:59,520
god gives a lot of helpful suggestions

00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,880
about how to get a linux club started

00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:04,520
and make it fun

00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:08,080
it's available at linux online at

00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:11,120
linuxclubguide.com recruit kids

00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:12,320
it's not that hard they will love it and

00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:14,000
i'm telling you this from personal

00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:16,559
experience

00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,279
get computers this is easier than you

00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:20,320
think

00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:20,720
remember they don't have to be new many

00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,480
people

00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:24,880
even some businesses will want to give

00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:26,080
you you computers for your club

00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:28,159
the school might have some they don't

00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,880
need anymore if you're currently working

00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:31,600
in tech

00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:33,200
then work your own contacts many people

00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:34,480
you know might have old computers laying

00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,400
around

00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:38,000
and there are plenty of places to get

00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:41,039
computers cheaply

00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,640
state governments universities

00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:44,720
often sell computers that they don't

00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:48,000
need anymore there are also

00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:50,480
thrift stores free geek tech dump

00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,520
and ebay we've gotten computers from all

00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:54,880
of these sources

00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:55,679
so can you do software and hardware

00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,919
lessons

00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:58,880
use stuff from a curriculum tips you see

00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:01,279
online or

00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:02,640
simply make something up there's nothing

00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:04,080
wrong with wording working right

00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:06,159
alongside your kids

00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:07,520
remember if you really screw something

00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:08,559
up and your computer doesn't work

00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:10,799
anymore

00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:11,760
just grab an install drive and start all

00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:13,200
over

00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:16,000
open source software gives you the

00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:17,600
freedom to do whatever you want

00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,520
our biggest project became our school's

00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:22,080
digital digital divide

00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:23,520
we closed it maybe this is what your

00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:25,840
local school needs

00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,799
the formula is simple open source

00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:29,360
software plus

00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:30,000
used computers plus enthusiastic kids

00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:33,279
equals

00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:35,440
more kids learn it works this

00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:37,200
isn't just about having fun this is

00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:39,120

00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:11,840
wonderful and uh we're glad to do it

00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:12,960

00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:15,279
so

00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:16,480
absolutely the best sessions here at the

00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:18,720
conference

00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:20,320
wonderful work the whole chat is

00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,919
exploding with people doing clapping

00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:23,360
emojis that's the digital version of

00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:25,279
applause of course absolutely

00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:26,960
okay now he just told me the whole chat

00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:27,840
is exploding with people doing clapping

00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:30,480
emojis

00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:32,320
so yeah and we're going to tell them

00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:33,600
clapping emojis are awesome but if

00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:36,720
you're inspired we need

00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:38,559
action so you know we talk a lot about

00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:40,000
the next generation of drupalists and

00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:42,080
where open source talent comes

00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,399
from and we tend to think about how do

00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:46,480
we get into college and universities but

00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:48,000
stem education research shows we've got

00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:49,600
to inspire these students by the time

00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,440
they get to middle school so you you've

00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:52,080
got them at the exact right age and the

00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:54,720
rest of us

00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:56,320
need to get into our communities and and

00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:57,200
see how we can replicate what you've

00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:00,480
done

00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:03,200
absolutely and uh we are just

00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:04,159

00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:15,919
