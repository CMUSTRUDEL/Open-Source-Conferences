	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
and get started okay uh so we're here

00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:04,640
today to talk to you about um the final

00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,839
countdown

00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:09,280
drupal 7 and drupal 8 end of life um

00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:10,559
this is kind of the general agenda we're

00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:11,120
going to go through the drupal release

00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:13,280
schedule

00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:15,200
we're going to talk about why drupal 9

00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,640
if you haven't heard of drupal 9 for

00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,400
some reason it's good to be aware of

00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,160
kind of the stuff coming down the pipe

00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:21,279
uh that's currently in development then

00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,080
we're going to go through some practical

00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:24,080
steps on

00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,439
going from drupal 8 to 9 and as well as

00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:28,080
drupal 7 to 9

00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,039
and then finally um matt's going to lead

00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,119
us out with a

00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,800
with a case study on uh how we moved

00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:35,280
awkward.com to drupal 9.

00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,880
so uh and i don't know full-time have

00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,200
time for q a but we do have some booth

00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:41,280
sessions later on where we can take q a

00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,719
um if that extends uh beyond this

00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,039
session so

00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,719
let's jump into it so uh dribble seven

00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:47,280
and drupal and eight end of life is

00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:49,520
coming

00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,559
uh so you can see here uh with the

00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,640
little pretty lines

00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:54,480
drupal seven support uh is extended

00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,480
until november of 2022

00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,000
that was originally november of 2021

00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,800
this year but because of covid and

00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,359
because

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,039
uh seven to eight and nine is like a big

00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:03,680
jump uh we'll talk about that in a

00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:06,159
moment

00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:07,200
uh we decided to extend that support for

00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:08,640
one extra year

00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,479
and then beyond that there's also a

00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,439
commercial drupal 7 extended support

00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:13,760
provided by

00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:14,799
a few different vendors uh if you want

00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,840
to use drupal 7

00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:18,640
beyond november of 2022. drupal 8

00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,640
however

00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,320
does end support of this year and there

00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,960
is no commercial extended support for

00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,680
that

00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:28,080
the reason for that is because uh drupal

00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,159
8 requires symphony 3

00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,320
which is an older version of symphony

00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,680
and the upstream symphony project is

00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,280
ending support for

00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,360
that version of symphony which means we

00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,759
too need to end that support as well or

00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:41,520
else our users end up not having uh

00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:42,240
important security fixes and things like

00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,640
that

00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,439
um so if you're on drupal 8 between now

00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,840
and november

00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:49,680
you need to make the jump to triple nine

00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,000
and then from drupal 9 to triple 10 your

00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,000
bill 10 to jupiter 11 and so on

00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,200
um if you have been in the drupal

00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,360
community for a while

00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,719
uh that prospect is probably absolutely

00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,920
terrifying because you're used to

00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:03,840
jumping from say

00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:05,680
4.7 to 5 and 5 to 6 and 6 to 7.

00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,880
those were really big jumps that

00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,560
required you know

00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,000
a whole bunch of retooling of modules

00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,160
and things like that uh

00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,920
drupal 8 to 9 is a much shorter jump and

00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:17,520
we'll talk about why that is

00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:19,040
so um if you haven't seen drupal 9 if

00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,800
you've been on drupal 7 happily for the

00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:23,120
past 10 years and you haven't really

00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,720
been looking around these are just a few

00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,400
of the drupal 9 innovations that you'll

00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,640
get if you move to trooper mine

00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,680
a lot of these were in drupal 8 as well

00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,280
um but

00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,800
the kind of the biggest thing i want to

00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,239
call out here is uh

00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,480
that would be different if you haven't

00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:37,840
touched drupal in a while is these six

00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,480
month feature releases

00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:42,480
so every six months we bump the version

00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:45,599
number of drupal so 9.1

00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:47,519
9.2 9.3 things like that and what we

00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,319
give you in those releases is backwards

00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:50,400
compatible

00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:51,599
features so new apis that you can

00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,560
implement uh

00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:55,519
new themes new uh features within the

00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,280
core product

00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:59,599
and all of the things that you see here

00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,920
media layout workflow and so on

00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:03,680
these were all done in these six month

00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:06,480
feature releases of drupal 8.

00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,800
so drupal 8.0 didn't have media you know

00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,560
we didn't have that until say drupal 8.4

00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,000
um and then all you would get out of

00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,280
that is you get new features that you

00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,280
can use in your site and

00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,319
you can kind of go from there the other

00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,000
thing i want to call

00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:20,319
attention to is the easy upgrade pad

00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,120
from drupal 8 uh to drupal 9.

00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:24,879
uh and that is great um we've purposely

00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,200
made it so that for example drupal 8

00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:29,280
modules can run in both versions drupal

00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,799
8 and 9 at the same time

00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,560
so we don't get into this problem what

00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:34,159
we've had in the past of

00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,519
you know developers kind of saying like

00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:36,480
well i have to rewrite my whole module

00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:38,799
anyway i might as well

00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,799
rewrite my whole module and then you

00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:42,400
know having months or years between the

00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,000
major versions of these modules coming

00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,560
up

00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,200
so let's talk about drupal 8 to 9 and

00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,799
what that

00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,720
uh path looks like and i'll hand it over

00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:53,360
to matt for this

00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,360
awesome thank you

00:03:54,879 --> 00:04:01,840
very much oh that might be

00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:16,799
muted now i think that's probably better

00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,680
awesome all right cool so upgrading to

00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:20,000
drupal 9

00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,440
uh we've defined basically these just

00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,280
kind of five

00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,720
quick steps right so the first thing to

00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:27,680
do is make sure your environment

00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:29,840
is um compatible uh with all the

00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,680
requirements for drupal 9.

00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,440
um so some of the stuff angie talked

00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,120
about just making sure everything is

00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,919
kind of good from a hosting perspective

00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:40,479
so php versions mysql versions

00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:42,880
all that kind of stuff next is to make

00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:46,479
sure you update core to the latest

00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:50,160
version all right so upgrade um

00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:51,040
to drupal 8.8 8.9 um to make sure that

00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,720
things

00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,160
work correctly so when you perform the

00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,280
core update things are kind of good to

00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,960
go

00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,880
and then update all your contributor

00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,720
projects um

00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:03,120
so that they are drupal 9 compatible so

00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,840
a lot of projects um support eight and

00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,199
nine

00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,720
um so you can make sure you get to the

00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:08,160
latest version to make sure that they're

00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,560
good to go

00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,639
and then uh remove any deprecated api

00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,120
use and custom code as with any drupal

00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:15,039
site

00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,240
obviously there's um going to be some

00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:18,960
level of custom code

00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,400
um so you can make those updates and

00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,360
make sure you remove those kind of ahead

00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,320
of time

00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,440
um and your bullet.189 will kind of

00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:28,080
support you in

00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:30,400
showing those issues and then just

00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:34,080
update triple core to drupal 9

00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,080
and then you should be also done

00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,919
so there are a couple of three key tools

00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:42,720
uh to help you get to d9

00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:44,639
uh the first is the upgrade status um

00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,639
module which has a personalized d9

00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:49,759
readiness dashboard that will show you

00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:51,520
basically everything as it currently

00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:53,520
currently exists with your site and kind

00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:55,360
of what you need to do to make it

00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,800
compatible with drupal 9 and what

00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,360
changes need to be made

00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,600
there's also the upgrade rector um which

00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:04,160
provides automated code fixing

00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:06,319
and then we also have deprecation status

00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,919
which is our dashboard of um community

00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:11,120
readiness for

00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:11,600
um moving to drupal 9. and then just

00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,440
kind of

00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,440
showing some of these a little bit more

00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,240
uh upgrade status uh when you install

00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:22,639
this it'll kind of show you uh

00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,160
what the requirements are for upgrading

00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:26,000
your site so seeing the screenshot it

00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,800
says like course fit 8.8

00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,840
or 8.9 to make that easier um also

00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:35,039
checks like php versions my sql versions

00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:38,560
um it also then starts down into module

00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:38,560
versions that are supported

00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,319
and jupiter will provide automated php

00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,600
code fixes

00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:49,039
so if you have any custom code um it'll

00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,360
help

00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:54,720
update that to the cricket api use and

00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,720
make sure things are good to go

00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,599
and then the deprecation status

00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:01,280
dashboard uh this is available on

00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:02,880
dev.aqua

00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,720
right now the current version we have

00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:07,199
out there is for drupal 9.

00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:09,039
uh the team is working on the drupal 10

00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:10,479
one coming soon

00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:12,639
but this will show you kind of module

00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:14,880
compatibility um

00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:16,160
and where things are at if there's

00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,080
outstanding patches

00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,680
things that need to be fixed um kind of

00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,880
what the upgrade plan is

00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,360
so you can make sure everything is kind

00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,360
of good to go

00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,000
okay then i can jump in here and talk a

00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,479
little bit about

00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,240
this drupal 7 to drupal 9 migration path

00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:35,360
so seven or eight to nine it's pretty

00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,960
straight forward you know get on the

00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:40,000
latest version of all the stuff

00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:41,759
get rid of the deprecated apis run php

00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,160
you're done triple seven and nine on the

00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:46,000
other hand is more of a process so we

00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,479
call this this is a migration not an

00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,400
upgrade

00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:50,080
so you are kind of taking from an older

00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,800
system and you're moving it into a newer

00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,560
system

00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,080
and there's a lot of different you know

00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,080
sort of

00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,360
implements of that for example analysis

00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,960
and planning especially if you built

00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,000
your site 10 years ago when drupal 7

00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,520
first came out you're going to want to

00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,319
take a look at that site make sure you

00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,400
still need

00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:05,919
the modules that you have the the

00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,759
content that you have maybe you want to

00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:08,879
prune old content content older than

00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:10,080
five years ago

00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:12,000
maybe you want to get rid of a bunch of

00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,360
spam users this kind of thing

00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,800
it's really helpful to kind of take a

00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,000
holistic look at everything that's in

00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,280
your database and figure out what you

00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,680
need and what you don't

00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,720
um there's a devops component um you

00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,960
know drupal 7

00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,840
still ran on php4 which hasn't been

00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:27,520
supported by the php community in

00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:28,479
eons uh so a lot of times you're looking

00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,160
at your hosting

00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:31,680
you know either improving or changing in

00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,120
order to support drupal 9

00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,880
because drupal 9 in order to keep

00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,760
everyone you know well supported into

00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,279
the future

00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,599
uh does require higher system

00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:41,680
requirements than drupal 7 did

00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:43,680
there's a data import piece so i'll talk

00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:45,519
about the migration api in a second here

00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:48,480
but essentially you

00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:49,519
create some yaml and php plugins that

00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,160
migrate the

00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:53,519
data from the source to the destination

00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,880
and you need to do that for any of the

00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:56,399
content in your site

00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,959
especially if it's provided by a custom

00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:00,399
module um then finally you have your

00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:01,920
your sort of like your business logic

00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:04,399
and presentation so

00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:06,080
the theme layer in drupal uh eight and

00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:06,880
nine was rewritten to be something

00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,839
called twig

00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,800
um which is a fantastic improvement it

00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,920
allows you to

00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:16,000
for example assume automatic escaping of

00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,600
things like xss vulnerabilities the

00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,680
syntax is very nice for people who are

00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,279
familiar with markup but not php

00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,720
but as a result of that there needs to

00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:23,360
be a whole retooling of your front end

00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,440
done

00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,800
um and similarly with any business logic

00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,240
custom code that you have

00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,760
you know drupal has this amazing

00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,279
community but unfortunately they are not

00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,800
going to put your code for you you need

00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:34,880
to do that yourself

00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,000
um so this can be a significant kind of

00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:39,200
thing let's talk about

00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,959
what the steps are i think the biggest

00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,880
piece of advice i can give you here is

00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:43,680
really audit the modules and custom code

00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,440
that you're running and

00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,040
ask yourself do you need it and

00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,880
especially do you need it now

00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,399
that in drupal 9 core is so much more

00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,200
fully featured than it was back in the

00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,959
day

00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,720
um you want to get on the latest version

00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:56,080
of all your drupal 7 projects a lot of

00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,519
times you know if you're on a

00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,040
version from two or three years ago

00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:00,880
there's been bug fixes since then that

00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,240
will make the migration smoother

00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,760
uh you'll want to check the known

00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,200
upgrade issues page and i'll be sharing

00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,680
these slides after

00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,519
this is a page on drupal.org with new

00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,480
you know known issues between the seven

00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:13,040
and eight

00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,480
uh or nine migration path for example

00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,000
something you might not expect is your

00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,079
views will not be migrated

00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,279
there's no automatic code you know sort

00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:20,720
of situation for views

00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:22,640
so you're going to have to more or less

00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,839
can reconfigure those by hand on the

00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:26,640
news site

00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:28,399
um and then unlike drupal 8 to 9 where

00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,399
you kind of do the update on the main

00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:31,600
site run update.php and you're done and

00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:33,839
that's kind of how

00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,279
even major versions used to operate from

00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:35,920
five to six and then you'd have like

00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:37,760
that

00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,519
harrowing you know few moments of like

00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,440
oh god is the update script gonna screw

00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:44,480
up my production site like it's very

00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:46,640
tense and stressful in drupal uh nine or

00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,560
eight and nine and above um

00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:50,079
you now do this by building out your new

00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,120
drupal nine site and a separate

00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:53,200
environment

00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,320
uh migrating the content and stuff into

00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,480
it and then

00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,240
um making a switch over the last second

00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,360
when you're ready to go

00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,640
so that's much better from the

00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,000
standpoint that your production site can

00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,360
stay up and running the whole time

00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,200
you don't experience downtime while

00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,399
you're doing your migration but it does

00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,000
mean you need kind of that separate

00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:09,279
environment in order to do it

00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,279
um so you're going to install a fresh

00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:12,800
copy of drupal 9 on that environment

00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:14,800
and this is really important you don't

00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,160
want to make content changes there

00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,000
because what you're going to want to do

00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,120
is do incremental migrations and pulling

00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,880
over all the new

00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,240
latest content from your drupal 7 site

00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,279
periodically as you complete your

00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,800
migration

00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:26,560
and every time you do that it's going to

00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,640
overwrite the stuff that's in the drupal

00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,120
9 site so treat your drupal 7 site as

00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,279
the

00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:33,040
the site of record drupal 9 is more or

00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:33,760
less some glass that's kind of seeing

00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,040
into it

00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:37,279
and pulling over the stuff that you want

00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,480
to see um so you'll migrate your drupal

00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:39,440
7 site into it

00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,600
and then you're going to port your

00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:43,600
custom coding theme and those things are

00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,440
often done in tandem with one another

00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,640
um and for porting your custom code and

00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,480
theme we'll talk about

00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,240
a few different tools that can help with

00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:53,040
this entire process

00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:54,240
so the migrate api is a really powerful

00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,000
api

00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,279
and it can pull from a lot of different

00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,120
sources so in

00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:00,399
core by default it's pulling from either

00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,680
drupal 6 or 7

00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:03,440
but if you're looking contrib there's

00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:07,120
all kinds of ones to pull from

00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:08,320
csv files or sql or wordpress or json or

00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,000
xml and

00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,000
you know various other uh types of

00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,600
things so it formats all those source

00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,120
things into a common language called the

00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,959
source plugin

00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,800
and then you're trying to map those over

00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:20,720
to a destination and the destination

00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:23,279
will be some kind of a drupal 9 concept

00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:25,760
like config or nodes or terms

00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:27,440
that kind of thing and then in between

00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,959
you have what are called process plugins

00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,480
what process plugins will do

00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:31,760
i have a little autobot logo there

00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,120
because they basically transform the

00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:36,240
data to for example

00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:38,399
remove white space or things like that

00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,680
so that's kind of how the api works in a

00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:42,399
nutshell there's a lot of really great

00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:43,600
documentation on drupal.org about this

00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:45,600
and then when you go to execute

00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,600
migrations you kind of have two paths if

00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:51,440
it's a very very simple site

00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:53,519
uh the core drupal migrate uh ui will

00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:55,040
might work uh this kind of gives you a

00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:56,800
list of all the modules and whether they

00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,160
were successful in upgrading or not and

00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,279
then you kind of like dig around and

00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,800
figure out what

00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:03,279
the problems were and kind of go from

00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:04,639
there what most people do in practice is

00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:06,560
use drush for this

00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:08,160
uh so there's a series of modules

00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,360
migrate tools migrate upgrade and

00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,800
migrate plus

00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,480
that give you a bunch of really helpful

00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,680
commands to use and rush the command

00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,240
line school for drupal

00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:18,079
to move all that content over uh roll it

00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,680
back if you're experiencing problems

00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:20,880
you know stop and reset you know

00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,480
different things view what kind of

00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:25,839
messages are coming from the system

00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:27,120
that kind of stuff um you also have to

00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:28,000
make sure there's a destination to

00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,839
migrate to

00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,600
right um so for your contrib and core

00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:32,320
modules this is largely taken care of

00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,079
for you

00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,680
at least if they have you know have

00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,800
developed a migration path but for your

00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,160
custom code

00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,920
um that will be kind of a different

00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:41,600
story so the first thing i would

00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,360
recommend doing is installing upgrade

00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,639
status and this is the same module that

00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,959
matt talked about in the drupal 8

00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:48,399
section just the drupal 7 version

00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:49,839
if you install that on your drupal 7

00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:52,160
site that gives you once again that kind

00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:55,040
of dashboard overview that says here's

00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:56,480
how ready or not your site is and here's

00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,920
different modules that you know in

00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,880
different states of development that

00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,279
kind of thing

00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,399
and then for your custom code uh we

00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:05,199
developed over a

00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:07,040
an aqueous hackathon one in one week um

00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:08,880
this drupal seven to eight nine module

00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,680
upgrader so it is not perfect but it

00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,680
does

00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:13,279
take a lot of the really tedious changes

00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:15,519
out so for example move

00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:16,320
info files to info yaml files it'll

00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:18,720
extract

00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:20,160
a hook block into some block plug-ins

00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,160
that kind of thing so it can get you

00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,760
you know say 40 to 50 of the way there

00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:25,440
with the skeleton of your module

00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:27,440
and then you can kind of go from there

00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,880
um it also has a mode which just runs

00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,240
analyze on the code it will point you

00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,440
off to different change records so if

00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,199
you're not familiar with the

00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,639
api changes between seven and nine it

00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:36,079
can help you kind of get up to speed on

00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:38,000
that

00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:39,279
um and then i like to plug this project

00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,839
this is a cool little thing

00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:43,839
called migrate qa which was developed by

00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:45,120
the phase two folks and what it is is

00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:47,120
it's essentially

00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,720
uh kind of like a meta layer on top of

00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,079
your drupal 9 migration

00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,079
where you you know it's like you know

00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:53,760
how we all use spreadsheets all the time

00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:55,839
this is basically using the spreadsheet

00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:57,600
inside of drupal so you can do things

00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:58,000
like you know market for review by

00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,240
someone

00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,079
and assign it to people you can flag it

00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,800
as like oh this has a broken image that

00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:04,880
kind of thing

00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:06,560
so it's a way to kind of do a content

00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:09,040
audit on the way in when it's coming to

00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,040
drupal 9.

00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:12,320
um so you might be asking like gosh that

00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,279
sounds like a lot of work is there an

00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,440
easier way

00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:17,360
um and this gets to the sponsored part

00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:20,160
of this uh session so i will talk

00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:21,519
briefly uh ever so briefly about a tool

00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:23,680
that we've had in development called

00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:25,199
aquarium migrate accelerate uh so this

00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,079
just launched in limited availability

00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:28,399
release

00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:29,600
last week the week before uh recently

00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:33,199
ago

00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:35,680
um so hi buddy

00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:36,320
my cat would like to uh be part of this

00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:39,199
presentation

00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,759
anyway so this is a product we built to

00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:41,600
uh

00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:43,199
you know help accelerate the migrations

00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,240
it is unfortunately not a one button

00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:46,240
click and poof

00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:48,079
magic ponies or farting rainbows

00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:50,800
everywhere but what it does do

00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:52,880
is it provides a workspace for you to do

00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,560
your migration it sets drupal 9 up for

00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,360
you automatically with the modules that

00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:57,360
you need

00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,800
um and it gives you a ui instead of

00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,759
command line tools in order to run the

00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,600
migrations

00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:02,880
so it's really helpful for you know the

00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,560
situation where

00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:06,800
a lot of times you know what happens in

00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:08,000
a drupal 7 and 9 migrations you kind of

00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,240
have to find the most senior

00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,040
developer at your organization to work

00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,959
on this stuff

00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:15,199
this allows you know more like a site

00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:15,519
builder or a junior developer persona to

00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:18,399
uh

00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:19,279
to make some progress on it um and what

00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:21,759
we're aiming for

00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:23,279
here is to reduce that time and cost of

00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:24,720
drupal 7 and 9 migrations quite

00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:26,399
significantly

00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,160
is very dependent on the site that you

00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:30,320
have how many modules you have

00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:32,160
how complex your data model is how much

00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:34,000
custom code you have and so on

00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:35,360
um but we are aiming to help because we

00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
really want to see

00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:40,000
you know all these folks make the the

00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,800
you know hurdle over to the drupal mine

00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,720
uh happiness way of life so what the

00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:46,720
tool will do is it'll give you a new

00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,320
um it's part of awkward cloud it will

00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,320
give you a new environment

00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:51,839
this environment is uh has a couple of

00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,360
special things about it for example the

00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:54,880
refresh button will allow you to

00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,639
automatically down sync

00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:58,160
uh data from your production environment

00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:59,120
so you're always migrating as the latest

00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:01,759
stuff

00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:03,519
um and we purposely don't let you copy

00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:05,600
and you know click and drag and drop

00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:07,039
code and files here because you don't

00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:09,360
want to accidentally

00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:11,199
you know take a drupal 7 database and

00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:12,720
throw it at drupal 9 code or vice versa

00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:14,000
because it'll really mess things up

00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,079
so the name of the game with migrate

00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,039
accelerate is let's get rid of a lot of

00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:18,319
the really

00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:20,640
awful ways that people can shoot

00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:22,959
themselves in the foot so

00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,160
um this is a part of it that i'm really

00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,280
excited about which is the module

00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,480
recommendations engine

00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:28,319
so if you've ever done one of these

00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:30,320
seven nine or seven to eight or any kind

00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:31,440
of migration from drupal

00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,960
you have to make this horrible

00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,320
spreadsheet of doom or it's like here's

00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,960
all the modules that i'm using and

00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,720
here's

00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,320
the drupal 9 equivalents but this one

00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,840
doesn't have a drupal 9 equivalent so i

00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:42,000
have to like go and look up

00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:43,520
what the best option is and what the

00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,880
migration path is and oh there's this

00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:47,360
bug and i need this patch

00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,960
we've already done that homework already

00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,880
on hundreds of modules especially the

00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:53,360
most frequently used modules and so

00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,720
we have basically a library that checks

00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:57,280
your drupal 7 site

00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,960
against our you know record of what the

00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,520
best modules are to use and what patches

00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,039
are needed

00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,799
and then we'll automatically set up your

00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:04,400
drupal 9 code base with those modules

00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:06,960
and patches in place so you don't have

00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:08,720
to do all the research

00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:11,120
and then the ui for the product is

00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:13,039
pretty simple it'll show you all of your

00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:14,640
data on your drupal 7 site kind of in

00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:16,480
site builder terminology

00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,000
so you don't have to know like you know

00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:20,240
d7 underscore

00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,240
entity node blah blah it will just show

00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:24,559
you what the human readable version

00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:26,320
of those things are um and then we have

00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:28,640
this dashboard

00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,520
and the dashboard will uh whoops will

00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,600
let you

00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:33,360
kind of see uh which which things you

00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,880
want to move you can migrate them

00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,559
independently you can migrate them all

00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,000
in a chunk it really depends on how you

00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:39,840
want to do it

00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,120
you can preview your data before it is

00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,960
migrated so you don't have to

00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,640
import everything then check for errors

00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,480
then roll it all back and come back

00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:48,400
you can see both the raw source and

00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,200
destination values as well as a rendered

00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,720
preview

00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:53,440
so you can check for things like broken

00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:54,960
images or things like that

00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,880
and if you want you can actually look up

00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,000
one particular thing by url if you're

00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,440
interested in say

00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,039
the latest press release that just went

00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:03,760
out last week as opposed to

00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:04,320
you know the other 30 000 of them um and

00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,480
then the

00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:07,679
actual ui is written in react using all

00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:10,320
the new drupal 9

00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:12,160
headless support so you just check off

00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:14,320
what you want to import you click import

00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,880
this little progress bar swooshy bushies

00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,000
and

00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,080
shows you all the things that are

00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,360
progressing and uh

00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,440
and the last thing is if you have

00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:22,799
problems we try to recommend solutions

00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,080
so there's a bunch of errors that you're

00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:26,160
going to get if you do a migration

00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:27,600
that's just part of the game what we'll

00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,520
do is give you some

00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:31,120
you know kind of drupal human readable

00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,840
advice on what to do about those

00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,919
problems

00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:37,200
kind of save you some googling and some

00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:39,200
stack overflowing during the migration

00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,880
um oh and then finally if finally

00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:43,520
finally if you are

00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,960
a uh drupal uh nerd who knows a lot

00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:46,480
about the underlying structures of

00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,880
migrate system and you don't want that

00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,720
kind of

00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:50,640
quote-unquote dumbed down for you we

00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,400
also provide insight into what these

00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:54,559
different things are so what we call

00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,000
shared structure for content items um

00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:57,840
what those end up being under the hood

00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,120
is migrate plug-ins which is useful if

00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:01,440
you want to get in there and debug

00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,440
anything

00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:05,360
all right that's the product pitch sorry

00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,480
about that uh now matt's going to talk

00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:09,280
about a case study

00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:13,280
of uh of how we went about bringing uh

00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:16,880
acquia.com over to drupal 9.

00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,880
all right awesome thanks andy

00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:21,520
all right so just to kind of bring

00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,559
people up to speed on what we did with

00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:25,120
awkward.com

00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:27,440
and just talking about where we started

00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:28,080
uh so we had a legacy code base that was

00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,200
built on

00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:32,480
um originally early d8 versions and we

00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,880
kind of went through all the work to get

00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,280
it

00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:37,280
up to speed so we brought it all the way

00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,559
up to 8.8

00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:41,600
made sure everything was kind of

00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:43,440
upgraded um appropriately

00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:45,440
part of why we started this we just had

00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,640
a site that was just had very disparate

00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,400
designs and ux

00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:50,080
throughout the entire site so everywhere

00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:52,480
you kind of look things were

00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:53,520
kind of like slightly differently um set

00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:56,320
up and

00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:57,760
i was hard to kind of navigate there's

00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:00,320
also a lot of technical debt

00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:01,440
um that was consistently making that

00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:04,480
site hard to update

00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,960
and maintain so um it was really a point

00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:09,200
in time

00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:09,200
to really make it um make it better

00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:16,159
and what we did uh so we started on a

00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:18,640
new drupal 9 code base

00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:20,320
from the ground up we re-evaluated and

00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:22,960
re-architected our

00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:25,120
entire content model um so we were it

00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,919
was very heavy originally paragraphs

00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:29,039
based

00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:30,960
uh we kind of restructured it down into

00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:33,600
more um

00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:34,880
more regular field based model we

00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:37,039
migrated um

00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,919
legacy structured content from eight to

00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:40,320
nine

00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:41,360
so things that were in paragraphs land

00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:43,520
and

00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:45,520
had more flexibility we kind of migrated

00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:47,840
out of that

00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:49,520
using a lot of the migraine tooling we

00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:51,120
did implement a component based design

00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:54,880
system and theme

00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:56,640
using site studio that was implemented

00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:59,039
and then we upgraded a number of custom

00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:02,320
models that we had to support d9

00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:05,200
i'm using a lot of the tools to

00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,200
make it easier

00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,559
and just some things to like what the

00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:12,159
watch

00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:14,559
what to watch out for things that we ran

00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:15,760
into um the first one being just any

00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:18,240
legacy code

00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:19,200
um as any site that's been around for a

00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,440
while

00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:23,440
um legacy code lurks in many dark

00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:26,159
corners of your site so be sure to

00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:27,520
kind of look through it and find it

00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:29,919
content migration

00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:31,280
even if migrating you can migrate legacy

00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:32,880
content from eight to nine

00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:34,640
so if you're doing dramatic changes to

00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,760
your content model or how your content

00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,679
is structured

00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,960
um there is some additional work that

00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:40,960
you can do to kind of make that

00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,480
migration over

00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:44,880
and working with any new tools and

00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:47,120
methods um so we added

00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,640
um site studio on top of this another

00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:52,240
awkward product

00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:53,039
and then just overall working in d9 was

00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,679
pretty much the same

00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:57,600
but i'm just making sure you make note

00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:58,720
of any of that stuff

00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:01,280
and then coordinating design and

00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:02,000
development as a as with any drupal

00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,760
project

00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,559
um keep an eye on scope creep making

00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:08,000
sure that you

00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:10,880
know what you're delivering and how much

00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,880
you're delivering one

00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:14,559
yeah i think what's cool about this is

00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:16,080
it shows you know there's you have a lot

00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:17,280
of different options on how to perform

00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,799
this migration so

00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:20,400
if you want to do just the quick you

00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:22,159
know i built my drupal 8 site a couple

00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:24,159
years ago i know it's solid let's just

00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:26,159
run the tools and get up to speed

00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:28,080
that that's an option for you if you're

00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:29,520
like you know i'm gonna as long as i'm

00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,880
doing an upgrade anyway

00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:33,280
why don't i take the opportunity to kind

00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,960
of look at you know what are the flaws

00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:36,799
in my current site how do i want it to

00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:38,320
work in an ideal situation

00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:39,760
you know like as matt was saying they

00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,960
really use this uh even though they

00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:43,039
could have just done a quick

00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:44,080
you know one two three done between

00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:45,120
eight and nine and they took the

00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,880
opportunity to kind of

00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:49,200
you know evaluate you know we really

00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,400
want more consistency in the branding

00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,320
we want to make sure we move to a

00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,919
component-based design you know it's

00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:55,440
it's a good opportunity to clean up some

00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:56,880
technical debt that might have you know

00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:58,799
accumulated on the site

00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:00,240
um and and put it under the guise of

00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:02,559
something that has business value

00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:04,799
to your stakeholders which is improved

00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:07,919
security support so

00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:10,000
yeah thanks man um if you want to learn

00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:13,039
more on any of these topics um

00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,400
uh come to the aqua booth matt is uh in

00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:16,159
there later on today

00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:18,000
going into more detail about the rebuild

00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:19,679
of awkward.com and site

00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,080
studio and how all that's empowering the

00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:23,200
marketing team uh we also have an escas

00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:25,679
anything by

00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:27,039
mike madison on drupal 8 to 9 updates if

00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:29,120
that's your situation

00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:30,880
and if your situation is 7 and 9 i'll be

00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:32,080
going more in depth on the aqua migrate

00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:33,520
accelerate tool

00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:35,200
um from three to three thirty and also

00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,840
happy to answer whatever other questions

00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:39,279
you might have

00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:40,960
so yeah thanks all right i'm gonna stop

00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:42,880
sharing and then we'll uh transition to

00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:45,600
q a oh and uh don't forget to

00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:47,600
tell us how we did on the survey for the

00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:50,799
session

00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,799
all right um

00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:55,360
let's see i see some things in the q and

00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:57,600
a tab

00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:59,200
this is a great question angie when do

00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:02,480
we move drupal.org to

00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:03,840
9. fascinating question so drupal.org is

00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:06,559
still on drupal 7

00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:07,919
these days not even drupal 8. um and i

00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:09,600
don't have a good answer for you what i

00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:11,440
can tell you is

00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:14,400
some of the challenges behind why

00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:16,799
drupal.org is still on drupal um

00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,440
triple seven and that is because

00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:18,960
although

00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:20,480
uh there's a lot of aspects of

00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,919
drupal.org that are kind of just

00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,440
you know standard drupally things that

00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:23,840
drupal's good at for example there's a

00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,279
huge

00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:28,159
knowledge base drupal's excellent at

00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:28,960
that um there's things that uh you know

00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:31,039
blogs

00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:32,159
you know community groups all these

00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:35,120
kinds of things

00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:36,400
um that's all pretty easy to migrate you

00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,360
know there's kind of built-in tooling

00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,440
for doing all of that

00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:40,880
but drupal.org is also the home of our

00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:44,000
developer community

00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:46,480
and because back in i don't know 2003

00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,760
or something we decided you know drupal

00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,840
is so powerful

00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:52,240
that i bet we could run our own version

00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:53,760
control system on drupal.org

00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:55,279
uh that was a decision that was made

00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,480
back then which is pretty great you know

00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:58,320
it's like it's neat that your

00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,840
your you know product is that flexible

00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:02,159
that can do everything even be

00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:04,960
github um but unfortunately because we

00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:07,679
built our own github on drupal.org

00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:09,360
it makes drupal.org very very complex uh

00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:11,360
to move over because

00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:13,279
um you know if you're doing your site

00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:14,559
right it should more or less be like say

00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:16,559
eighty percent contributed

00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:18,400
projects twenty percent custom code

00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:20,400
that's a very rough guideline

00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,440
um jupiter is not like that there is a

00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,520
lot of custom code

00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:25,840
required to do that as well as some

00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:28,080
stylistic changes and things like that

00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:29,840
um so the reason why drupal.org is a

00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:31,440
difficult one to get moved every major

00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:32,559
version is because of all that kind of

00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:34,880
custom code

00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:36,799
stuff um so i know the drupal

00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:38,640
association is working on plans to

00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:41,679
migrate more and more of that

00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:43,520
project module stuff to uh git lab which

00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:45,039
is kind of an open source version of git

00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:46,880
github that we've started using within

00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:48,640
the past couple years um

00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:50,080
and as more and more of that happens it

00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:52,240
will be much much easier to move

00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:53,200
drupal.org to drupal 9 because we'll be

00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:55,200
talking about just

00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:56,720
moving the drupal stuff not the coding

00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:59,840
stuff um

00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:01,600
so in short i don't know um i imagine

00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:03,440
that tim linen and folks are having a

00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:04,880
drupal.org panel they usually do with

00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:06,159
these drupal cons so i would recommend

00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:07,679
showing up to that and asking that

00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:09,520
question

00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:11,679
uh do you need to be using aqua in order

00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:12,080
to use aqua migrate accelerate uh sadly

00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:14,640
yes

00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:16,720
at this time you do we do have future

00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:19,039
plans to open source that uh ui

00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:20,880
the whiz-bangy thing but because you

00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:22,080
have to have an environment to use

00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:24,880
drupal 9

00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:26,399
uh itself uh it was seen as a lot better

00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,919
user experience to build the hosting

00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:29,919
component into the product

00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:32,240
um so at this point it is available to

00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:34,320
anyone on aque cloud enterprise

00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:37,440
um and we're working in the future about

00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:37,440
uh expanding that out

00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:43,600
let's see what were some complicated

00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:45,679
drupal 7-9 issues that you had to debug

00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:49,039
and what is the process like

00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:50,559
um so you're just gonna get a bunch of

00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:52,320
errors i don't know matt was this your

00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:53,760
experience as well when you

00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,880
you know tried to move from eight to

00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,559
nine were you getting a bunch of

00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,600
migration errors or was that pretty

00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:59,039
straight um i mean i know

00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,799
migration was probably definitely one of

00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:04,080
the the harder parts

00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:06,320
that we tackled um but it was

00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:07,679
more just like having to run it like

00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:10,480
consistently

00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:11,360
um was our biggest thing um especially

00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,720
if you don't

00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:15,360
if now you're implementing content

00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:16,960
freezes and things like that to

00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:19,520
make sure people won't keep like adding

00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:21,760
content to the site

00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:22,960
yes that is a whole thing yeah deciding

00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:24,240
when is the right time to pull the

00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,919
trigger on the migration

00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:27,760
and then after that don't make more

00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:29,279
changes

00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:31,600
you're going to seem to be on a hamster

00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:32,080
wheel of sadness um yes that's a good

00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:34,480
point

00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:35,760
so but in general that the common issues

00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:38,480
page covers a lot of this

00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:40,880
um and it'll be things like you say your

00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:43,200
filter formats won't quite line up right

00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:45,440
um you know if there was a filtered html

00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,159
in drupal 7. there's a basic html in

00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,080
drupal 9

00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:49,679
sometimes that can cause problems so

00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:50,880
it's mainly things that especially if

00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:52,399
your site is older

00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,919
and was kind of architected on older

00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:55,120
technology you might you might struggle

00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:58,559
with

00:28:55,120 --> 00:29:00,799
um i believe we are out of time

00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:02,559
is that correct michael that was quite

00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:05,200
correct if um you

00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:05,840
have a few minutes built in but um yeah

00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:08,799
we were

00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:09,840
wrapping up at 11 55 so if you will so

00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:12,960
one more question

00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,960
that we have time

00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,919
all right how about we'll answer this

00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:26,080
last question can you see the cat yeah

00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:28,240
what's up

00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:30,080
she does not like that but there she is

00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:32,240
okay

00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:33,360
that was not a good time wow she was

00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:35,679
stressed

00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:38,159
um so we saw the cat i'm just looking

00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:38,159
really quick

00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:41,440
pantheon does not to my knowledge have

00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,399
an equivalent to awkward migrate

00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:44,080
accelerate

00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:45,679
and then what pantheon advocates is the

00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:49,200
use of feeds

00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:49,760
ui which are feeds migrate uh ui which

00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,039
is a

00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:52,799
module that's in development that kind

00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:54,880
of uses the feeds module on top of the

00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:58,000
migrate module

00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:59,840
um some of the critical contributed

00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,480
modules are not supported by drupal 9

00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:05,520
still

00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:05,520
that is true if we go actually can i

00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:09,840
duplicate status

00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,919
sorry this will be the last question

00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:15,039
because this is actually a really good

00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:17,600
question that

00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:17,600
lots of folks

00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:23,520
so if you take a look at deprecation

00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:26,000
status hopefully that's what you see is

00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:26,000
that what you see

00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:32,960
cool um so this will show you a list of

00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,320
the modules that drupal has and whether

00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,440
or not they're compatible yet with

00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:37,760
drupal 9.

00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:38,799
uh so as you can see if you go by usage

00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,799
all the top

00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:42,240
say 50 i think i need to go like three

00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:43,760
or four pages into this

00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:45,520
to find one that is not drupal 9

00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:47,919
compatible which is good

00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:49,120
um so most of them are explicitly drupal

00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:50,720
9 compatible

00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:53,279
anything in this yellow zone which is

00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:55,120
its only info files or composer json

00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:57,200
program what that means is that

00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:59,039
there's a one line change required on

00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:00,799
any drupal 8 module to make it drupal 9

00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:03,440
compatible and that's to change its info

00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:05,760
file to say hey i support anything

00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:07,360
greater than drupal 8 point whatever and

00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:09,120
also drupal 9

00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:10,880
and if that one line change hasn't been

00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:13,279
made the module might work fine

00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:14,640
for drupal 9 but it won't register as

00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:17,440
such in the tool

00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:18,559
and there was an effort done about six

00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:21,120
months ago or so

00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:22,720
to go and automatically file patches

00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,919
against all of those modules that fall

00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:26,640
into this bucket

00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:27,679
um and so what if you see a module is

00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:29,760
not compatible

00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:31,519
check its issue queue because a lot of

00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,080
times there are patches there to either

00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:34,559
fix this

00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:36,000
one issue or issues that are covered by

00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:37,840
that rector tool that we talked about

00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,559
rector being the tool that automatically

00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:40,399
translates

00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:41,600
your php code from one version to the

00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:44,320
other

00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:45,440
um so there you go that's about three

00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:47,120
quarters of the

00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:49,440
pie that's already drupal nine

00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:51,600
compatible if you are and fall into this

00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:53,760
unlucky bucket of this one quarter

00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,960
um then i would still check the issue

00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:56,480
queue because some enterprising

00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:58,320
contributor might have come along and

00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:59,679
already ported the module and just the

00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:02,080
maintainer hasn't gotten around to it

00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:03,840
yet you can also choose to take over

00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:05,760
maintainership of a module

00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:07,519
if you want um there's a process called

00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:09,039
the abandoned projects process

00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:10,640
where essentially if you reach out to a

00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:12,159
maintainer they don't respond then i

00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:14,080
think it's two or three weeks

00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:15,440
then you're able to make yourself the

00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,880
maintainer and then you can make commit

00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,840
whatever changes that you need to do to

00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:19,760
the module

00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:21,600
um so that would be kind of the worst

00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:23,519
case scenario you'd be looking at that

00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:25,519
some other module developers might offer

00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:27,600
uh sponsorship opportunities if it's a

00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:28,960
very complex module with a lot of

00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:30,720
you know moving pieces that might be

00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:32,320
really hard to port um

00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:34,240
so there's a lot of different options

00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:35,279
but i would first check just check the

00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,399
issue queue because

00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:38,159
nine times out of ten there's going to

00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:39,919
be a patch that does what you need

00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:43,279
incorporate that into your composer json

00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:45,760
and you're good to go

00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:47,200
okay now we're definitely over time

00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:48,559
thank you so much everybody i really

00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,039
appreciate the opportunity to speak with

00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:50,880
you

00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:52,320
and yeah if you have other questions uh

00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,760
you can find both matt and i at the

00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:57,360
aquay booth later on today

00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:57,360
