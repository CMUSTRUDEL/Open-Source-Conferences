00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,559
hi this is jay calicott from media

00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,920
current

00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:13,759
today i'm going to explain why

00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:15,679
decoupling drupal is actually easier

00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:17,440
than you might think

00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:18,960
our team here at mediacurrent has been

00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,560
championing decoupled drupal for a

00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,960
number of years now

00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:24,160
we love to pair gatsbjs with drupal 8 or

00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,240
9 for that matter

00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,080
to create an incredibly performant

00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,560
secure and stable solution for

00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,079
enterprise organizations

00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,920
the main thing we want you to know is

00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:35,520
that if you're thinking about decoupled

00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,600
one of the biggest pieces you need is

00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,960
already there it's already part of your

00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,879
aaa application that of course is the

00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,120
json api module

00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:47,039
the json api module is part of drupal

00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,719
core and is a key ingredient to

00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:52,000
transforming your application

00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,000
into a decoupled solution

00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:55,280
so what are the ingredients to migrating

00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,160
your existing site to a headless

00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,079
architecture

00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,320
let's go through each ingredient one by

00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,320
one

00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,000
the first ingredient as mentioned is the

00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:06,240
json api module

00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,479
this module is added to aaa core and is

00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,799
also present in drupal 9.

00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:13,040
the json api module simply exposes all

00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,960
of your content in the json api format

00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,680
so that it can then be consumed by other

00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,799
applications

00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:20,400
including gatsbjs

00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:22,560
the next thing you need to do in order

00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,240
to integrate with gatsbjs is to add a

00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,240
source plugin that will connect

00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,159
the gatsby application to the content

00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,560
being served by drupal

00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:32,400
gatsby has a host of source plugins that

00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,400
connect to any number of data sources

00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,200
including drupal wordpress and many

00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,200
other platforms

00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,960
of course you'll need to host your

00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,479
static application somewhere

00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,159
for the drupal side of things you don't

00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:45,680
really have to change anything you can

00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,040
continue to host on your existing

00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,200
hosting platform

00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,560
for gatsby we like netlify because it

00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,280
has many features

00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,560
and very reasonable pricing it's also

00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,719
easy to set up

00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,479
currently most of our implementations

00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:00,119
are using netlify as a host for our

00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:02,719
gatsby js applications like

00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:04,479
mediacurrent.com

00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:06,159
the next ingredient is optional but

00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:08,080
helpful and that is the build hooks

00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,679
module for drupal

00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,920
the build hooks module has a connector

00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:12,879
with nullify that allows you to easily

00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,200
trigger new builds

00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:16,800
in gatsby from drupal if you are

00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,480
familiar with how gatsby works

00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,400
it essentially rebuilds a site every

00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,640
time you tell it to rebuild

00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,080
this module makes it easy to configure

00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,720
so that every time you save a piece of

00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,239
content

00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,879
you can trigger a new rebuild

00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:28,879
automatically

00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:32,480
gatsby cloud is also optional but has a

00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,920
host of great features that you're

00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,360
likely going to want if you're using

00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,840
gatsby

00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,599
the team that created gatsbs has been

00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,519
busy working on a number of features

00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:42,720
including live preview incremental

00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:44,319
builds and more

00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,680
we recommend you integrate with the

00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:48,319
service to get the most out of your

00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,640
gatsby application

00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:52,400
finally the last piece to add to the mix

00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:55,440
is the gatsbjs module

00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,239
available on drupal.org if you're using

00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,519
gatsby cloud

00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:59,440
you're going to want to configure this

00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:02,840
module so that you can leverage live

00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:05,040
preview for a seamless editing

00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,720
experience there are many ways to make

00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,440
the transition to decoupled and it

00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,760
doesn't always

00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,120
involve a full rebuild let's discuss

00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,879
some of the ways you could transform

00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:18,239
your existing drupal architecture

00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:19,840
to a headless application with gatsbjs

00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,200
first we discussed the quickest route to

00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,959
make your site ready for integration

00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,400
with gatsby is simply to install the

00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:27,840
json api module

00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:29,519
provided by core next you'll need to

00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,319
look at the site's overall content

00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:32,400
architecture

00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:34,319
to see how far you are away from having

00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,480
a content model that makes sense for a

00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:38,080
decoupled application

00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,080
it's possible that you don't need to do

00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:43,200
a lot because drupal is already great at

00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,959
defining a well-structured content model

00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,879
that being said if you're using layout

00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:48,640
builder or panels extensively

00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:50,080
moving to decoupled is going to be more

00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,760
of a paradigm shift

00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,360
which means you're probably going to be

00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,519
making more changes to your content

00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,200
architecture

00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:58,879
if you are going to keep your content

00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,360
model mostly intact without major

00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:01,200
changes

00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,280
you're literally halfway through a

00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:07,439
transition to a fully decoupled

00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:08,959
application in some cases it might make

00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:10,400
sense to go ahead and create a new

00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:11,760
install profile

00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,640
we actually took this approach on a

00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:16,320
recent client build they were already

00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,639
running a multi-site and we were tasked

00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,239
with

00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:19,759
creating a new microsite that would be

00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:21,120
decoupled

00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,040
rather than starting fresh with a

00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,759
completely new code base we were able to

00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,160
add a new

00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:27,040
install profile onto their existing code

00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,639
base

00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,240
one of the tangible benefits of this

00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:34,240
approach is that we could add the new

00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,240
site onto their existing hosting plan

00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,440
okay let's wrap things up today i wanted

00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,800
to share the idea that moving to a

00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:43,759
decoupled architecture

00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,360
is actually easier than you might think

00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:46,960
when you're planning your next redesign

00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,560
you should consider that the bulk of the

00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,840
effort will be on the front end which

00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,840
you're probably going to have to

00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:54,840
completely redo anyway

00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:56,720
so why not create that new frontend in

00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:59,600
react

00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,800
the last thing to consider is your team

00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,400
if you have a team that's great with

00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:05,280
dribble development but not as up to

00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,800
speed on react and graphql technology

00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,320
then that learning curve is probably

00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,759
going to add time and risk to the

00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,360
project

00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:14,000
in that situation maybe you're good with

00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,680
the standard drupal theming approach

00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,520
however if you don't already have a team

00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,280
in place you're probably going to find

00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,320
that it's easier to acquire developers

00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,080
that no react

00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,639
than it is to find developers well

00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:26,160
versed in drupal theming

00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:27,520
and that's really one of the compelling

00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,880
reasons to choose this type of

00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,880
architecture in the first place

00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,400
on the one hand you've simplified the

00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,160
back-end side of things

00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,560
where you can get a lot done with drupal

00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,440
site building skills then on the front

00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,360
inside of things

00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,199
you can take advantage of a large pool

00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,240
of talent that knows how to build react

00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:47,600
applications

00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:49,199
i call that a win-win at meteor current

00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,000
we have a great team of developers

00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:52,320
strategists

00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,680
designers and problem solvers that can

00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,120
help you navigate these type of

00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,880
decisions
