00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:40,320
so thank you for participating in

00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:43,040
drupalcon it's day three

00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,640
of our week together to learn connect

00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,719
and build drupal

00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,800
as of today i have a new participant

00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:49,600
count so as of today our numbers went

00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,039
over

00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:56,160
2 300. so we've got over 2 300

00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:57,600
people here with us at drupalcon and of

00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,160
those registered like i mentioned

00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,840
earlier

00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,920
about a third of those are attending

00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,760
drupalcon for the first time so that's

00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,199
really really exciting

00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,680
and i think it's good news for our

00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:08,320
community that we continue to expand and

00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,760
grow

00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:13,360
and i hope that we use this time

00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:15,680
together to connect as well

00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:18,080
so once again this year moving drupalcon

00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:20,000
online had the added benefit of allowing

00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,720
us to dramatically widen

00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,880
our scholarship program efforts and this

00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,640
year we expanded our outreach

00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,240
to students as well so if you're

00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,560
students that are with us say hi in the

00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:32,560
chat so folks can connect with you

00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,400
um but there are students that are here

00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,479
that wanted to learn more about drupal

00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:39,600
and open source so we welcome you

00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:41,280

00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,240

00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:51,840
through our scholarship program with a

00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,439
mentor so folks that have been there

00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,200
done that with drupalcon

00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:56,560
so that we could really maximize the

00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,280
experience and the connection that

00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,280

thank you to these organizations and our

00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:06,399
local drupal associations who partnered

00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:07,439
with us to recruit these new scholarship

00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:09,840

and to drupalcon

00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,400
while our drupal association team puts a

00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,239
ton

00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,680
of talent and energy into making

00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,599
drupalcon happen

00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,760
we simply couldn't do it without the

00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:28,959
support and collaboration of our

00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:30,959
sponsors and contributors

00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:33,360
so thank you to all of our drupalcon

00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:36,080
sponsors we truly appreciate your

00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:38,800
ongoing support of the drupal project

00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,400
and of the drupal community so this is

00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,319
where everyone in chat says thank you

00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,519
thank you sponsors and you look at all

00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:45,200
the logos

00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:47,360
and then you go to the expo hall every

00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,480
chance you get you say hi and thank you

00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,640
and they give you

00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,879
ideas and prizes and we all get to

00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,480
connect and say do it again next year

00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:56,400
so that everybody comes back to sponsor

00:02:54,480 --> 00:03:00,000
drupalcon wherever we land

00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,360
in 2022. and this year we had a new

00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,080
category of support

00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,519
individual sponsors and so to be honest

00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,519
this is something that we've seen some

00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,440
of the local camps do amy june talked

00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:10,640
about the importance of drupal camps and

00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,640
local events so

00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,680
we said maybe this idea would work also

00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,840
for drupalcon

00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,519
so thank you to those that stepped up

00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,080
and gave a little bit extra as part of

00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:20,239
their ticket

00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,080
purchase to support this event and in

00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:26,319
turn support our community's

00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,319
opportunity to gather and collaborate

00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,280
this year over half of the contributors

00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:32,000

00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:40,960
event drupalfest it's a month-long

00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,639
series happening in april right now

00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:45,280
of virtual events focused on the

00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:48,240
community contribution and the positive

00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:50,080
impacts made possible by drupal we

00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,600
encourage you the community to help make

00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,440
drupalfest fun

00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,759
and to make it even more valuable for

00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,880
everyone we really encourage you to host

00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:58,560
your online events

00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:02,240
in your local time zones and in your

00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,240
local language whenever possible

00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:06,560
so some of you may only know the drupal

00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:08,000
association as the organization that

00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,400
hosts drupalcon

00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,720
but we do much more throughout the year

00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,240
we provide training resources for you

00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,759
and your teams to learn how to

00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,320
contribute to drupal

00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:18,800
we can we collaborate to foster a

00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,639
healthy

00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:23,199
diverse and inclusive community of

00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:25,759
innovation and we work to make it easy

00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:28,160
for organizations to select drupal

00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:30,320
as their digital experience platform of

00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,960
choice

00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:34,720
so if you need help hiring drupal talent

00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,639
finding a job in drupal

00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,960
connecting with the right partners

00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:41,199
expanding the visibility of your brand

00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,000
or even managing drupal security updates

00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:45,280
more easily

00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,840
we are here to support you

00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:49,440
so our drupal association vision and our

00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:52,479
vision's our ultimate goal

00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:54,400
and that's for a safe secure and open

00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:56,880
web for everyone

00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:59,039
we get there through our mission to

00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,800
accelerate the drupal project and to

00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:03,440
support the growth of our drupal

00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,440
community

00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:08,560
in the last half of 2020 we created a

00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,360
three-year strategic roadmap for our

00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,520
work

00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,639
giving us additional focus about how we

00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,360
meet our mission

00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:15,759
and provide maximum impact in a positive

00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,400
way

00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:20,160
for drupal so today i'll have a chance

00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,840
to share some highlights around a few of

00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:25,840
the projects that we've already put into

00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:28,560
motion to support these strategic goals

00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:30,319
in an ideal world everyone using drupal

00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,960
would be contributing back to it

00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:34,639
i think we can almost all agree on that

00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,319
and if you don't we can talk about it

00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:37,680
come to the da booth and we'll explain

00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:39,759
why

00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:42,000
so interestingly yesterday i got to

00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:43,840
listen to nikhil deshpande

00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,160
who's the chief digital officer for the

00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:48,080
state of georgia which is where i live

00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:50,639
and he was talking about the imperative

00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:52,240
for contributing back to drupal

00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:54,080
and he shared a really interesting

00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,599
analogy um that i hadn't

00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,120
heard before but just makes a lot of

00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:58,479
sense so we were talking about why it's

00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,639
important to contribute

00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:02,000
and in this case we were talking to end

00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:03,520
user enterprise

00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,680
organizations about why they should

00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,520
think about contributing

00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,800
and nikhil said you know he was talking

00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,720
about it and he said

00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,080
you know we plant trees because we need

00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,400
oxygen

00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:16,000
so if we think about drupal contribution

00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:19,520
contributions the oxygen

00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,520
needed for a thriving drupal project

00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:23,360
providing recognition for those who do

00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,880
contribute is one of my very favorite

00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,759
things that we get to do at the drupal

00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,919
association

00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:28,880
so thank you contributors you'll see

00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:31,280
here the top

00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:32,000
50 individual contributors over the past

00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,599
year

00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,240
so give them a lot of drupal thanks in

00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:37,840
the chat as well

00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,520
and here are top organizational

00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:41,680
contributors for drupal

00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:43,520
so you're all planting trees thank you

00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,039
for the drupal oxygen

00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,879
and for ensuring that we have the

00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:49,759
ability for drupal to grow

00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:49,759
and to innovate

00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,879
so drupal's actually a leader in open

00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:57,120
source when it comes to the system we

00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:58,000
use to recognize contribution of both

00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,960
individuals and

00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,160
organizations there's always room for

00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,080
improvement

00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,520
so we have been looking at next steps

00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,360
and a couple things that we're working

00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,199
on in the immediate future

00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,479
include implementing a non-code

00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:12,960
contribution type

00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:14,800
not based on issues that can accommodate

00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,599
community roles that our contributors

00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,759
serve in

00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:18,639
as well as one-off contributions and

00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:21,680
activities that

00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:23,440
take place outside of drupal.org

00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,360
the next piece we're working on in our

00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:27,199
roadmap for 2021

00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:29,440
is creating dashboards to help the

00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:33,360
community visualize and understand

00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:33,360
our contribution ecosystem

00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:38,080
so we do contribution recognition but

00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:40,159
there are a lot of tools and systems

00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:42,000
that we either have today or are

00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:44,080
thinking about for tomorrow to really

00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,480
better enable contribution

00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,480
our engineering team's been hard at work

00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,399
to provide the tools and systems that

00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,080
better enable you to contribute

00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:54,080
and to not just contribute but

00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:56,720
contribute easily so that we can bring

00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:59,120
more and more people into the project

00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:01,440
you can learn more about these projects

00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,480
by watching the drupal.org panel from

00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,360
earlier this week

00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:07,120
and the recorded content on vimeo you

00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,920
can come to the dress note q

00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,240
a after this you can find tim with me in

00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,040
the

00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,240
d the d a q a session tomorrow there are

00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,600
a lot of ways for you to learn about

00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,880
what we're doing and if you have any

00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,880
questions please let us know

00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,880
so you're going to hear the word

00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,480
contribution a lot this week and that's

00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,519
not a coincidence in case you didn't

00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,760
figure out

00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:29,440
contribution is a central focus of

00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,360
drupalcon this week

00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:34,000
this year we made a really conscious

00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:35,760
decision and we took a bit of a risk

00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,920
and made a strategic shift with a

00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:40,720
significant goal in mind

00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:42,880
each day we focus and each day we

00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:45,279
contribute

00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,880
so with drupal 10 on the horizon we

00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:48,839
wanted to rally the community

00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,000
around drupal's key strategic

00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:52,000
initiatives

00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,120
in collaboration with core mentoring

00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,120
coordinators

00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,120
core initiative coordinators and the

00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:59,200
drupalcon program committee

00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:02,320
we all work together to evolve the

00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:03,760
contribution experience at drupalcon

00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,079
not only to better support key

00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:08,560
initiatives but to better connect

00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:10,720
participants with how to get involved

00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:13,120
we hear time and time again that there's

00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:15,200
sometimes a willingness to contribute

00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,720
but no you don't know where to go you're

00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,240
not sure who to talk to

00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,839
you don't know how to break into certain

00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,440
circles to be helpful

00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:23,440
so we're hoping that the way that things

00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,959
were structured this week really help

00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:28,079
you break some of those

00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:28,880
barriers to contribution and all of this

00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:31,040
is done

00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:34,480
with the ultimate goal of accelerating

00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,480
drupal project innovation

00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,839
so thank you to everyone who's already

00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,120
contributed this week we've seen a lot

00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:41,519
of new faces

00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,720
in our virtual contribution spaces and

00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:44,079
if you're thinking about it but you're

00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,000
just not sure where to start

00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:47,920
this week's the perfect time you can

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,720
stop by the contribution booth in the

00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,480
expo hall

00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:53,279
to get connected and learn about next

00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,880
steps and for those of you contributing

00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:59,040
be sure to share your stories with the

00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:59,040
hashtag drupal contributions

00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:03,360
i firmly believe that one of the most

00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,720
effective on-ramps for people to join

00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,560
the drupal community

00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,480
is through local events and we actually

00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:10,079
just heard about this from amy june

00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,920
as part of her acceptance speech about

00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:13,360
how that's how she got connected

00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,200
and that's what made such an important

00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:17,360
impact for her

00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:19,279
and to better enable new people to make

00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:21,360
that local event connection

00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:24,560
we really needed to reimagine how events

00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:26,399
are positioned on drupal.org

00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,079
so you may have already seen this but if

00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:30,000
you go to the community events listing

00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:31,839
you'll notice some major improvements to

00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
the community event listing

00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:35,839
and this is just the beginning we're

00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,320
working to bring all drupal events

00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:38,640
together

00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,480
not just drupalcon events but everything

00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:44,160
connected to drupal event

00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:46,000
world together at events.drupal.org

00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:48,160
we want these connection opportunities

00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,600
to be more visible we want everyone to

00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,760
find things easy

00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,880
and if someone's discovering drupal we

00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:55,040
want them to see

00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:57,519
the scale and the impact of what's

00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:59,600
happening at a global capacity

00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:01,279
we also want to give event organizers

00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,000
the ability to have their events

00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:05,680
featured

00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,519
in a really prominent way so thank you

00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:09,279
to the event organizers working group

00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:10,720
team who's collaborated with us at the

00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:12,320
da to make this happen

00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:14,800
we have a lot of work in front of us but

00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,959
we've got a really clear plan and vision

00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,240
and i would be remiss if i didn't say

00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:21,040
kaleem wants me to tell

00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,240
all of you hosting local events get your

00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:26,480
event posted

00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:26,480
so that we can share it at drupal.org

00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,079
so we've done some work in addition to

00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,639
everything that we've talked about so

00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:32,880
far

00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:35,920
we did some work around kind of this

00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:38,160
idea of strategic contribution

00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:39,600
and the process of of getting people

00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:41,120
connected to the contribution

00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,880
opportunities

00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,480
part of that's been done from a non-code

00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,079
experience

00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,600
so one of the first things we did was

00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:49,839
update our language

00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,360
frankly we had talked about contribution

00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:53,040
when we talked about code

00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,880
and we were starting as a community to

00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,160
say code and non-code and pull it

00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:58,240
together

00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:00,480
but when we said things like drupalcon

00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:02,399
volunteer opportunities promote drupal

00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,160
volunteer opportunities

00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:05,519
we were kind of making it a little too

00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,920
muddy

00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:09,680
so volunteers are contributors and we

00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,440
want to emphasize that language because

00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:13,200
it's a it's just as important

00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,120
that the work's done for non-code

00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,800
contributions as anything else

00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,160
so non-code contributors your

00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,760
contributors and you're part of our

00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:22,399
official language

00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:24,560
we implemented this year a new strategic

00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:25,680
contribution process for both drupalcon

00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:28,320
north america

00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,680
and promote drupal we started with those

00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,360
two programs because that's where

00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:33,600
there's a nice

00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,480
a good amount of non-code contribution

00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,000
but there are also

00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,760
things that we felt like would make good

00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,480
pilots that we could learn from

00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:41,920
and then scale across the project so

00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,760
with this updated approach

00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:46,160
and frankly this is nothing new it's new

00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:47,839
to drupal but it's something that i've

00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,279
personally used in other volunteer

00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:51,600
organizations and it's been really

00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:53,199
successful so i'm super excited to see

00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,720
how it translates to the drupal

00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:56,399
community

00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,320
what we did with this updated approach

00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:59,920
was provide a more detailed

00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,519
information about the specific

00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:03,519
opportunities available

00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:05,440
with both of these programs we talked

00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:07,680
about what to expect

00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:09,440
the timing and commitment the skills

00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,800
involved and then we also talked about

00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,360
what you'll get in return

00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,880
for your contribution we matched your

00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,720
current skill sets to the right

00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:18,560
placements so that we could get you

00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:21,040
the right person doing the right things

00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:23,199
what felt good for you as a contributor

00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,800
we also asked what skill sets you want

00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:26,320
to develop along the way

00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,839
and we're working throughout all of our

00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:30,880
programs to make sure to be able to

00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:32,160
support that skill development

00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,920
one really cool thing about the

00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:36,240
application process update

00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:37,760
was it allowed us to cast a much wider

00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:40,079
net so as i mentioned

00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:42,480
earlier over half of our drupalcon

00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:44,639
program and summit contributors were new

00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,320
to the event and many of those were

00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:49,120
contributing to drupal for the first

00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:51,279
time through these roles

00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,160
so to shift gears just a little bit i

00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:54,720
want to talk about

00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:56,320
cultivating talent so there's consistent

00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,240
demand for drupal talent

00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:00,079
and we have an opportunity to cultivate

00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,560
that talent and provide better

00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:04,560
connections to our community

00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:06,639
so this year we've been talked about it

00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:08,399
in 2020 but this year it's actually

00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:10,240
happening and i'm super excited

00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:12,560
we've launched a new community driven

00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,760
program discover drupal's our new

00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,440
initiative to unlock

00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:17,360
opportunities for people who've been

00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:19,199
underrepresented in the open source

00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,880
community

00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:23,040
this initiative provides training

00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:25,279
scholarships internships

00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:27,519
mentoring from drupal community members

00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:29,519
and connections to potential employers

00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:33,120
helping those students build skills and

00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:35,199
launch promising careers in open source

00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,959
we believe the community of people

00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:38,639
building digital experiences should

00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:39,680
reflect the people who rely on them

00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:41,600
every day

00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:43,519
so with discover drupal we hope to not

00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,839
only remove some of the barriers

00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:48,000
for underrepresented students but we

00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:49,759
hope to enable better more relevant

00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,440
digital experiences for millions of

00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:52,800
people around the world

00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,560
so if you're as excited about this

00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,120
program as we are i'd love to hear from

00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:57,680
you

00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:59,519
we're seeking mentors we're looking for

00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,720
sponsors both organizational and

00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:02,399
individual

00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:04,160
that sponsor money helps us grow the

00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:05,360
number of students that can be in this

00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:08,880
initial cohort

00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:10,959
for 2021.

00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,800
so it's important given all the things

00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:14,880
we're doing that i take a moment to

00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,639
thank our supporting partners

00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:18,639
funding from these organizations is

00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:19,120
critical in supporting all the drupal

00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:21,279
con

00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:23,279
work that we do when they're drupal con

00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:24,959
sponsors but then we shift to all of our

00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:27,279
non-drupalcon work and that's where

00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:29,279
supporting partners come into play

00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:32,000
so thank you to our enterprise

00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:32,000
supporters

00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:37,360
our signature supporters our premium

00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:40,320
supporters

00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:43,519
lots of logos that's a great thing

00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,519
classic supporters

00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:53,759
and our community supporters thank you

00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,480
so dries you're with me i wanted i

00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:56,560
wanted to

00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:58,880
to have you with me for this for this

00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:01,680
piece as i start to wrap up

00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:03,199
um it was less than a year ago at

00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:05,600
drupalcon global

00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:07,520
that we paused for eight minutes and 46

00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:09,439
seconds to reflect upon

00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:11,600
violence against black and black trans

00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:12,400
lives and in particular the violence

00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:15,120
that caused the

00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:17,199
death of george floyd um and just a few

00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:18,240
days ago violence took the life of dante

00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:20,880
wright

00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,520
so you know racism permeates every

00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,160
structure

00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:25,439
in our society and is deeply embedded in

00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:27,039
our history

00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:29,919
and we thought it was really important

00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:32,240
today um to take a moment to think about

00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:33,600
this as a community so

00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,520
recently there have been escalating

00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:37,679
violence and ongoing harassment directed

00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,799
at asians asian americans pacific

00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:41,440
islanders

00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:42,880
we stand in solidarity with and in

00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,480
support of these communities

00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:46,320
and with all people of color who

00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:49,280
experience marginalism

00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:49,919
and racism we stand in solidarity with

00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:52,799
those of you

00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:54,320
actively engaged in anti-racist action

00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:55,120
and so dries and i wanted to take a

00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,280
moment

00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:59,039
with you as our community to reflect on

00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:00,480
these issues and how they affect the

00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:04,080
health of our community

00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,080
so we'll take a moment together now

00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:17,840
we recently published a list of

00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,880
resources on drupal.org to support you

00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,559
our community

00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,960
you'll find this under the resources

00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:24,720
link on the drupal.org homepage

00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,480
as part of this link you'll also find

00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:29,520
excellent resource lists created by the

00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:31,039
drupal diversity and inclusion group

00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,799
so the drupal associations made

00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:33,679
diversity equity and inclusion a

00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:35,760
priority

00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:37,919
and this resource is a small part of an

00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:39,360
operational de ni work plan we've been

00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:41,120
developing

00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:43,440
so dries i know all of these things are

00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:45,760
as important to you as they are to me

00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:47,760
um and that we are working together you

00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:49,520
know all all of this ties into our

00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:51,200
organizational strategic plan

00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:52,559
uh which you and the board were part of

00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:55,120
of helping to develop

00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:55,600
in support of drupal so we really hope

00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,600
that

00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,640
you know these these things contribute

00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:03,360
to a healthy

00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:03,360
drupal community and a stronger drupal

00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:09,520

00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,799
first of all for those people that don't

00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:41,120
know me

00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:43,200
my name is dries i am the founder of

00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:46,720
drupal i started drupal

00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:49,440
20 years ago as heather explained and

00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:51,280
i'm the project lead and so i'm excited

00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:53,200
to be here today with you

00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:55,200
and we have a lot to cover we're going

00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:58,160
to talk about drupal 9 and

00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:00,080
drupal 10. i'm also going to talk about

00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:02,559
falling in love with drupal

00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:04,240
and lastly i want to talk a lot about

00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:07,200
getting off the island

00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:08,240
so maybe a little bit mysterious but um

00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,799
you'll find out more

00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,760
in a minute um so let's start with

00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:14,880
drupal 9

00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:17,360
and drupal 10. um

00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,320
but first i wanted to say a few words

00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:21,600
about

00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:23,280
the pandemic obviously um

00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:25,039
you know it's been a difficult time for

00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:27,280
many uh various

00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:28,400
people in the project have lost family

00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:31,360
or friends

00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:32,400
to covet i too actually lost a family

00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:34,799
member

00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,679
just a couple of weeks ago and so it's

00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:38,799
definitely

00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:40,720
a difficult and devastating time uh but

00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:43,679
also as a project we lost

00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:45,440
um you know ben uh chavit uh due to

00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:47,520
covet he's he's been a long-term

00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:50,559
contributor to drupal so

00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:53,039
um you know i wish we could be in person

00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:54,320
uh for drupalcon and it would have been

00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:57,120
in my hometown

00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:58,880
boston but unfortunately until we have

00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:02,000
the virus under control

00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:04,880
it's just not a good idea so also

00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:07,360
excited to do the event virtual because

00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:09,600
it is more inclusive and more accessible

00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:11,200
that way as well i hope you all stay

00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:14,480
healthy

00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:17,200
of course the fastest way to getting

00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:19,600
back on track and meeting in person

00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:22,080
and having drupal cons in person is you

00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:25,039
know covet like fixings right

00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:26,080
um and guess what uh three out of four

00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:28,240
companies

00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:31,200
that have a vaccine actually use drupal

00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:34,000
for their websites the fourth one is

00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:35,440
astrazeneca and they use adobe

00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,120
experience manager

00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,880
uh maybe they'll use drupal at some

00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:41,520
point however

00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:43,919
the university of oxford who developed

00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:45,760
their vaccine you know for astrazeneca

00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:49,200
actually does use drupal

00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:51,919
um so in many ways um a lot of drupal

00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,480
being used all around by organizations

00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:54,960
that

00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:56,640
you know help um you know help us fight

00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:59,200
cove at 19.

00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:00,559
and um i wanted to call that out because

00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:03,919
it actually makes me proud

00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:05,520
you know it makes me proud to see that

00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:07,520
those kinds of organizations

00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:08,880
organizations which you know frankly are

00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:11,919
saving millions

00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:12,640
of people you know um actually use

00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:16,640
drupal

00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:18,880
and um and that we as a drupal community

00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:19,919
can sort of indirectly support them you

00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,760
know obviously

00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:23,919
we support these things in a small and

00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,640
indirect way but it's still something to

00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:27,760
be proud of

00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:30,320
i think as as a community so

00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:32,000
um there's also lots of other

00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:33,520
organizations using drupal here's

00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,720
another great example

00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:38,720
it's the empire state buildings website

00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:40,320
a building that everybody knows in the

00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:44,080
world right

00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:45,919
and they're actually using covet um

00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:47,919
you know in the closures around kovy to

00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:48,720
do some renovations on the building

00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:51,200
including

00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,919
sort of the famous observatory at the

00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,159
top of the

00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:55,919
empire state building and they decided

00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:58,480
they needed a new website

00:22:55,919 --> 00:23:00,080
to match those renovations and so very

00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,720
cool that the empire state building's

00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:03,600
website

00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:04,559
runs on drupal as well so when we get to

00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:07,200
travel again

00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:08,000
and you find yourself in new york with

00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,799
friends or family

00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,320
or something make sure to point to the

00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:14,400
empire state building

00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:16,080
and to tell your friends and family that

00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:18,559
their site runs on drupal

00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:19,440
and if you're a contributor to drupal

00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:21,440
and hopefully

00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,799
you know many of you will become

00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:25,360
contributors this week

00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:26,799
uh you can even say that you helped um

00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:31,440
you know make their website

00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:33,440
in a way right so um pretty cool um

00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:35,039
you know lots and lots of websites are

00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:38,799
actually starting to use

00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:41,120
drupal 9 as well we released drupal 9

00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:42,320
just like 10 months ago so not even a

00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:44,880
year ago

00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:45,360
and as you can see from the screenshots

00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:48,559
on

00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:51,440
this screen a lot of websites like nato

00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:54,159
or the paris tourism website or the

00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:55,840
world wildlife fund or budweiser if you

00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:59,120
like a beer or redhead or

00:23:55,840 --> 00:24:01,360
an ibm you know these are all the kinds

00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:04,799
of organizations that have

00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:06,720
adopted drupal 9 already and

00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:08,000
the big reason is that drupal 9

00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:10,720
obviously comes with

00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,120
new great features but also that it's

00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:14,720
been

00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:16,559
easy to upgrade a lot of these websites

00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,000
were already using drupal and have

00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:20,799
recently upgraded

00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,600
to drupal 9 and one actually really cool

00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:24,960
example

00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:27,840
is pac-12 not all of you

00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:29,760
may know pac-12 but if you live in north

00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:32,720
america you probably do it's a

00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:34,159
well-known college sports network i

00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:36,799
would describe it

00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:37,520
um and they have like websites and tv

00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:39,600
stations

00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:41,520
and mobile apps and they literally you

00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:44,240
know follow a lot of sports themes

00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:46,559
and they you know broadcast thousands of

00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:49,200
hours of tv and video

00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:51,440
and often also through their website and

00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:54,480
they really use drupal in a pretty

00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:56,159
strategic and really cool way um

00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:58,480
it's really like the core publishing

00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:01,360
platform for so many things that they do

00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:03,120
like for example when you watch tv you

00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:04,559
watch their games on tv

00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06,240
at the bottom of the screen you have

00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:08,000
this you know thicker i guess i don't

00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,279
know what to call it where text scrolls

00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,760
left to right

00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:13,440
and uh that content is actually pushed

00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:15,440
to these tvs if you will

00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:17,039
through drupal right so drupal is a

00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:19,200
content backend for all of that

00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:20,880
but even a schedule on your tv if you

00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,080
look at the program guide or whatever

00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,799
you want to call that

00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:26,720
because sports are you know fluid i

00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:28,240
guess they can run over

00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:30,159
they constantly have to adjust these

00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:32,400
schedules and push them

00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:34,480
sort of in real time to your tvs and

00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:36,720
even the schedule management

00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:39,039
is all done by drupal and then obviously

00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:41,679
they have their mobile apps etc etc so

00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:42,720
if you think about it it's lots of

00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:44,480
traffic

00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:46,960
but also very complex you know it's a

00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,679
complex digital experience platform that

00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,520
way

00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:51,520
and i was talking to them not too long

00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:54,240
ago and they were telling me about how

00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:54,799
their migration from drupal 7 to drupal

00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:58,000
00:25:54,799 --> 00:26:00,480
which they did a while back obviously

00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,320
actually took over five months and it

00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:04,640
required a team of people

00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:06,960
i think they said five to six people

00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:10,000
program management project management

00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:12,000
consultants it took five plus months and

00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,080
then more recently

00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,120
they've also upgraded from drupal 8 to

00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,799
drupal 9

00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:19,520
and they were telling me it actually

00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:19,919
took less than two months and it only

00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:23,120
took

00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:25,200
one developer what an amazing story and

00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:27,039
this is obviously for a very very

00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:29,200
complex website so

00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:30,720
if we actually look at some data here uh

00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,559
something that i've shown in the past

00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:34,559
but we kind of measure

00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:35,919
how long it takes to go from zero

00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:39,360
websites to

00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:40,640
60 000 websites and as you can see on

00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:44,159
this slide it took

00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:47,120
drupal seven seven months drupal eight

00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:49,679
three months and drupal nine just one

00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:51,200
month to get to sixty thousand websites

00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:54,400
in production

00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:55,200
and so obviously you know faster than

00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:58,559
ever

00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:59,919
which is really really exciting

00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:01,919
another data point that we could

00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:04,640
actually look at is sort of the

00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:06,720
readiness of the contributed modules

00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:10,400
and on this slide you actually see some

00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:13,120
data from way back when 2017

00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:14,679
and i showed this data in my dress notes

00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:18,159
uh in baltimore

00:27:14,679 --> 00:27:19,600
2017 and what we looked at here is the

00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:22,480
readiness of the top

00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:23,440
50 modules the most used modules the top

00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:27,200
50 most used

00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:27,200
used modules and

00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:31,760
and we showed this 17 months after the

00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:33,679
launch of drupal 8

00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:35,279
and this is where we stood at the time

00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:37,679
and so as you can see

00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:38,640
roughly a third of the top 50 modules

00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:41,039
were ready

00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:43,520
after 18 months after the release and

00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:45,600
roughly two-thirds of the modules

00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:47,039
were not ready right they were either in

00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,080
final testing or still in their

00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:50,960
development

00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:51,600
now if you compare that to today's state

00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:54,640
it looks

00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:56,240
something like this you can instantly

00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:58,720
see it's a lot better

00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:00,480
obviously very important to know too is

00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:03,840
that the timelines don't match

00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:07,279
right we're comparing 17 months to

00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:08,799
10 months since drupal 9. that's a big

00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:10,080
difference but that's the data that we

00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:12,480
have

00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:14,240
and again it's already looking a lot

00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:17,440
better like 90 percent

00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:19,919
of the top 50 modules are basically

00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:20,799
ready to go and that's why it makes it

00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:23,919
so easy

00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:26,000
to start upgrading your websites right

00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:26,720
and the reason why so many modules are

00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,200
ready

00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:31,120
just as a reminder is because of some of

00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:33,760
the key changes that we've made

00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:34,799
in how we develop drupal and release

00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:37,679
drupal

00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:39,679
you know we no longer break sort of the

00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:40,399
world between major versions we make

00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:43,120
sure there is an

00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:43,679
upgrade path and backwards compatibility

00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:47,440
and as

00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:49,600
a result upgrades are no longer hard and

00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:51,600
you also constantly get new improvements

00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:53,120
and new innovations every six months and

00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:55,919
people really like it

00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:56,960
um and it's been a huge huge success as

00:28:55,919 --> 00:29:00,000
you can see

00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:02,960
you know based on this data nine months

00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,640
after the release of drupal 8 and so

00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,919
something that we all worked really hard

00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:09,039
on and that we should

00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:10,000
be really proud of as well now if you

00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:13,520
expand

00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:16,480
out from 50 modules to more modules

00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:17,679
it looks something like this and again

00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:20,640
you can see

00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:21,520
that as a whole the project is much more

00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:24,480
stable

00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:26,480
upgrades are going to be much more easy

00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:29,600
and things are looking really

00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:30,799
really well and you know it's even going

00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:33,760
to get better

00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:34,480
we're currently working on drupal 10 our

00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:37,520
target

00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:38,000
release date is the summer of 2022 so

00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:40,880
next

00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:42,080
summer it's over a year away and we're

00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:45,679
working on five

00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:47,120
major initiatives i'm going to talk

00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:49,039
about these real quick

00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:50,559
i know you're learning about them

00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:51,279
already this week and you'll learn more

00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:53,679
about it

00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:55,600
later this week but we feel really good

00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:59,600
about these initiatives first of all

00:29:55,600 --> 00:30:02,720
um we picked them for a reason uh we

00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:05,200
had surveys and we collected feedback

00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:06,960
and we looked at what we have to do as a

00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:08,159
project and you know all of these things

00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:10,720
combined

00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:11,520
led us to picking those five initiatives

00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:13,360
so let's take a

00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:15,760
closer look i'll go relatively quick

00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:17,279
because you have these initiative days

00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:19,360
uh this week so i don't need to go into

00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:20,840
a lot of detail but let's start with

00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:23,760
decoupled

00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:25,840
menus

00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:27,360
all right so a lot of great progress on

00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:29,200
the coupled menus you may have learned

00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:31,600
about all of that yesterday

00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:33,279
we've got a lot of things done we can

00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,480
now have javascript projects on

00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:36,559
drupal.org

00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:38,000
we figure out how to publish um

00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:41,200
javascript to

00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,520
npm uh we have built proof of concepts

00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,760
we

00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:45,679
created menu components uh things like

00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:48,399
that and currently we're working on

00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:49,039
um you know making some changes to

00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:52,080
drupal's

00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:52,960
apis or some additions to drupal apis as

00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:56,080
well as writing

00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:56,720
uh documentation for the solution that

00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:59,279
we've

00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:00,799
come up with so looking really good uh

00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:02,559
really encouraged by

00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:05,279
decoupled menus obviously it's very

00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:07,200
strategic to kind of branch out to the

00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:08,880
whole javascript world and all of the

00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,679
frameworks and the innovation that's

00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,679
happening

00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:12,880
in the javascript world and it continues

00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:15,360
to you know

00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:16,480
solidify drupal as a leader for headless

00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,840
and decoupled

00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,840
and you know we'll extend that

00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:21,519
leadership i think we'll have something

00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:23,919
here with the couple menus

00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:25,360
that no other headless content

00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:27,360
management system has

00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:28,799
you know will be easier than our

00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:32,000
competitors so

00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:35,360
uh really really cool um

00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,480
you know next we're gonna look at easy

00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:39,279
out of the box

00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:40,000
uh which actually is today's initiative

00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:42,320
day

00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,720
um we've made some good progress as well

00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:46,960
we added claro as beta

00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:49,360
i would say we've made limited progress

00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:51,279
around media and layout builder

00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:53,360
a lot of great planning a lot of great

00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:55,679
ideation and ideas

00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:57,919
but we really need some more help moving

00:31:55,679 --> 00:32:01,039
these things forward and so i'm hopeful

00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:03,440
that we can um you know do that today

00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:04,720
we'll be sprinting and collaborating

00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:06,640
this afternoon

00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:09,440
and hopefully we can push some of these

00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:12,720
things uh forward

00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:16,240
um all right automated updates

00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:18,640
is our third initiative and this one

00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:20,399
looks you know very green i would say

00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:22,480
we've got a bunch of things done we can

00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:25,200
actually do automated updates now

00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:26,640
for drupal 7 and drupal 8 through a

00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:29,440
contribute module

00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:30,880
which is pretty cool it's not um it's

00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:33,519
not built for a composer

00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:34,799
if you will but we've learned a lot from

00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:37,360
building these

00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:39,039
uh you know modules and we're now taking

00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:40,480
all of these learnings and applying them

00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:43,279
to drupal 9

00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:44,080
and we're adding automated update

00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:46,640
support

00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:47,760
to drupal 9 core and we're doing it for

00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:50,080
composer based

00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:51,279
you know sites obviously because that's

00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:54,399
the go to way

00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:57,200
um in drupal 9.

00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:58,320
we're working on the readiness check api

00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:00,880
we're working on

00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:03,039
even better um signature verification to

00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:04,559
make sure that these updates are are you

00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:07,120
know not compromised with

00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:09,679
uh so to speak so lots of good progress

00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:11,279
there's been a lot of great momentum

00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:13,200
you know we could use more help and

00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:16,240
tomorrow we'll be working on

00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:19,440
automated updates uh fourth

00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:22,840
um we'll be talking about drupal 10

00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:26,080
readiness this one is just

00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:29,200
ginormous it's a lot of work

00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:31,039
i colored it yellow but um

00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:32,799
it doesn't really communicate well the

00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:35,360
amount of progress

00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:37,760
and activity that we're seeing around

00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:40,960
this initiative like we got

00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:44,000
on we're now symphony 5 compatible we've

00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:46,720
migrated from composer 1 to composer 2

00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,080
we've updated the upgrade status module

00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:50,000
for drupal 10

00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:52,799
and we're working through symphony 6

00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:55,600
even ck editor 5. it's a heart migration

00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:57,919
because of api changes with ck editor

00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:59,360
and we've already made some progress too

00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:03,200
on the jquery ui

00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:04,880
removal i colored it yellow only because

00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:07,440
we need to

00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:08,560
keep up that activity and that momentum

00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:10,639
possibly even

00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:11,679
increase it and it's an important

00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:14,399
initiative because

00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:16,240
a lot of this work is around making sure

00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:17,679
that drupal uses the latest and the

00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:19,919
greatest

00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:21,599
components that we depend on and

00:34:19,919 --> 00:34:24,879
sometimes for security

00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:28,000
reasons or often for security

00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:29,440
reasons and so we really need to really

00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:32,159
need to get this done

00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:33,599
in order to release drupal 10 and if we

00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:34,560
don't get it done we may actually have

00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:37,599
to push

00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:40,480
the drupal 10 release date um

00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:41,040
you know in order to allow for more time

00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:43,440
so

00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:45,040
that's the drupal 10 readiness again a

00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:47,200
lot of great momentum

00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:48,399
very grateful for all of the activity

00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:52,240
that's been happening

00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:52,879
um last but not least we have a new

00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:54,960
front-end

00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:56,480
theme for drupal we don't have a sprint

00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:59,440
day for it today

00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:00,079
uh this week i should say but i feel

00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,760
like

00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:03,760
some really great progress has been made

00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:05,359
here as well it's actually in core as

00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:07,520
beta right now

00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:09,920
and you know there's work left to be

00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:12,720
done uh bug fixes a lot of

00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:13,200
uh of them around the accessibility uh

00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:15,440
of

00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:16,560
um oliveira which is obviously very

00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:19,599
important

00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:19,920
but this one we can definitely get on if

00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:22,560
we

00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:23,440
you know find some people to help us

00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:27,520
with these

00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:29,359
accessibility features or bugs

00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:30,560
so looking pretty good so overall i

00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:31,680
would say we've made a lot of great

00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:35,760
progress

00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:35,760
a lot of activity as i mentioned

00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:39,440
i would also say that drupal 10 is

00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:42,160
probably

00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:43,119
closer than it appears i mentioned we're

00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:46,320
targeting

00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:48,079
the summer of next year um but that does

00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:49,040
mean we have to keep working on all of

00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:51,839
these initiatives

00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:53,359
in order to get them done right and so

00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:55,359
that's actually a good segue to this

00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:58,400
slide which shows you some of the

00:35:55,359 --> 00:35:58,960
key milestones or key planned dates that

00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:02,000
we have

00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:03,040
in mind right now so we've got two weeks

00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:06,480
left to get things

00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:09,680
into drupal 9.2

00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:12,560
and after that we have the drupal 9.3

00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:14,400
development cycle and that cycle runs

00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:17,200
until the

00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,760
october of this year basically and

00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,680
probably

00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:22,320
our best chance to get things into

00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:24,000
drupal 10.

00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:25,599
you can see that there's a development

00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:29,040
cycle after

00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:31,200
drupal 9.3 as well towards the bottom

00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:33,440
there of the screen

00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:35,599
but it may not your best chance to get

00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:37,440
things into drupal 10 because

00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:39,280
at some point we need to switch gears

00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:41,280
and we need to start focusing

00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:43,680
on getting ready for drupal 10 which

00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:46,720
means you know focusing on removing

00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:49,760
deprecations etc etc so

00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:51,119
i would say that this year at 9.3

00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:53,599
specifically

00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:54,880
is a really important timeline time

00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:57,839
frame for us

00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:59,040
in order to make progress towards drupal

00:36:57,839 --> 00:37:00,480
10 so if you're thinking about

00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:03,119
contributing to drupal

00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:05,200
and drupal 10 specifically now is kind

00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:06,160
of the time so please keep the timeline

00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:09,280
in mind

00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:11,920
it increases your chances of getting uh

00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:12,560
really cool new features into uh drupal

00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:14,960
10.

00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:16,320
uh real quick some um other important

00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:19,520
dates for drupal 7

00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:21,040
and drupal 8 these are mostly reminders

00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:24,800
we have a lot of new people

00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:27,119
so i did want to remind people

00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:29,520
of those dates but the top you can see

00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:31,920
that drupal 7 is supported on the

00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:34,800
until the end of next year and that we

00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:38,320
have commercial support after that

00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:41,440
and you can also see that drupal 8

00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:44,480
is end of life later this year

00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:46,400
now you may wonder why drupal 7 is

00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:49,680
supported longer than drupal 8.

00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:51,359
it's a very good question and

00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:54,880
the reason is that the upgrade from

00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:57,119
drupal 7 to drupal 8 or drupal 9

00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:58,640
uh is a difficult upgrade you know we've

00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:01,520
talked about that

00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:03,119
we definitely acknowledge that it's hard

00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:04,480
and we wanted to do the right thing

00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:06,640
you know we wanted to do the right thing

00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:07,280
for our users and give them additional

00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:09,920
time

00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:12,160
so they can upgrade from drupal 7 to

00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:14,000
hopefully drupal 9.

00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:15,839
and as we talked about the upgrade from

00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,920
drupal 8 to drupal 9

00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:19,440
is a lot easier as i've shown with the

00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:22,079
pac-12 example

00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:23,839
and so please keep those timelines in

00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:25,839
mind

00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:28,640
plan accordingly because if you're on

00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:31,119
drupal 8 you have to get to drupal 9

00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:33,119
before the end of the year and if you're

00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:35,280
an agency or a drupal shop

00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:37,040
also help your customers plan

00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:41,200
accordingly

00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:43,680
that will keep everybody secure and safe

00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:45,680
you know overall i would say we've made

00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:48,000
a lot of great progress

00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:49,119
towards drupal 10. i feel like we're

00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,920
working on the right

00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:53,520
initiatives and so really let's continue

00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:54,400
the momentum that we have with these

00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:57,520
initiatives

00:38:54,400 --> 00:39:00,640
and try to get as many features ready

00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:03,200
by drupal 10. i want to thank

00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:04,000
all of the individual contributors that

00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:07,760
have helped

00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:09,920
or contributed to drupal since last june

00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:11,520
since that release of drupal 9. so in

00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:14,000
just 10 months or so

00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:15,760
we've had over a thousand hundred people

00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:19,119
contributes which is

00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:22,240
absolutely amazing and fantastic um i

00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:24,640
also wanna recognize the sponsors

00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:25,599
that are behind many of these people not

00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:27,680
all of them

00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:30,240
um but about two-thirds of all of the

00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:33,760
contributions are sponsored

00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:37,920
um and so far again sort of in the last

00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:42,040
10 months since the release of drupal um

00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:44,400
you know nine we had 365

00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:45,359
organizational contributors as well in

00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:48,720
this slide

00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:51,920
actually shows the logos of the top 100

00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:53,520
contributors and just as a literal fyi

00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:55,839
or fun fact

00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:57,040
all of them have made at least five

00:39:55,839 --> 00:39:59,920
contributions

00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:00,880
to drupal 9 and many have made many more

00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:04,000
contributions

00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:05,280
to drupal 9 so thank you as well to the

00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,920
sponsors behind

00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:09,200
all of the individual contributors so

00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:12,000
now is a quick update

00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:15,839
on the state of drupal 9 and our plans

00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:18,640
for drupal 10 and how we're doing

00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:19,920
next i wanted to talk about falling in

00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:22,640
love with drupal

00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:23,280
um i know that's a little bit mysterious

00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:26,960
but

00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:28,960
um let's get into it

00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:30,079
so these five initiatives that i've

00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:31,520
presented

00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:33,440
as i mentioned i feel like they're

00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:36,079
really great um

00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:37,760
and important but you may have noticed

00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:41,200
that there is like a sixth

00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:43,040
pillar here and i often ask myself

00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:44,800
what else should we be doing you know

00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:47,280
what else do we need to do

00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:49,680
to you know help drupal grow and make

00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:52,560
drupal even more successful

00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:54,000
and there's many opinions and many

00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:56,079
options there's many things that we

00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:59,119
could do and should be doing

00:40:56,079 --> 00:41:02,160
um but how do we narrow it down to

00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:04,319
one specific thing and uh that's not an

00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,640
easy task and what i wanted to try and

00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:07,839
do

00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:08,400
today you know make a recommendation and

00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:11,440
help us

00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:13,520
align on what else we need to do but

00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:15,520
before i make my recommendation

00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:18,000
i wanted to talk a little bit more about

00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:18,800
the state of drupal and provide you some

00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,359
context

00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:22,480
for why i think we need to do what i'll

00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:26,720
propose

00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:30,079
in just a few minutes now

00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:31,839
if you were to ask you know 20 drupal

00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:34,400
users if you will

00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:35,599
what is the most important strength of

00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:38,240
drupal

00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:39,359
you most likely would get 20 different

00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:42,160
answers

00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:42,640
and sometimes those people will probably

00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:45,680
need

00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:48,160
20 minutes to explain it to you

00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:50,079
right because you know it's like this is

00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:51,280
great and that is great and here's why

00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:54,000
it's great

00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:55,200
and um the point here is that there

00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,920
isn't always

00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:59,599
a focused answer and there isn't always

00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:01,520
a simple answer

00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:02,800
and for some that means that drupal's

00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:05,920
identity

00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:08,880
might not be clear that maybe we've

00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:11,760
even lost our way a bit and it might

00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:13,760
also help explain why it might be hard

00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:16,000
to align on what the most important

00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:19,599
thing to work on is

00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:22,880
and so i believe we need to give

00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:24,000
every user every individual every

00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:26,800
organization

00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,760
and even every contributor a very clear

00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:31,520
reason

00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:34,000
as to why they should adopt drupal right

00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:35,520
and this actually made me think because

00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,760
a few years ago

00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:39,520
i was uh at a private conference

00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:41,440
actually at a conference

00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:43,119
and such an adela was sort of the

00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:45,359
keynote speaker

00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:47,680
and he was being interviewed at this

00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:51,440
conference it was like a q a

00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:54,640
and the interviewer talked about how

00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:57,119
microsoft had lost its way a little bit

00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:58,640
when sachin adela became the ceo of

00:42:57,119 --> 00:43:01,359
microsoft

00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:03,040
and had really big shoes to fill like in

00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:05,920
a way he stepped into

00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:07,599
the shoes of not just steve ballmer but

00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:11,119
also bill gates you know both

00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:12,920
very iconic leaders and yet

00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:14,720
such an adela did sort of the

00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:17,839
unimaginable

00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:19,760
and was successful at reinvigorating

00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:23,119
microsoft if you will

00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:24,079
and um the interviewer asked him in this

00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:26,640
interview

00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:28,480
how he did that and he gave an answer

00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:30,560
and this is a few years ago

00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:32,560
that was really interesting to me and i

00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:35,359
i haven't forgotten that answer

00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:36,560
and so i found a video clip where he

00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:38,640
answers

00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:40,319
the same question it was not at the same

00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:41,599
conference that i was at but he answers

00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:44,079
the same question

00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:45,440
and so i wanted to play you uh this

00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:47,839
video

00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:50,000
so let's take a look i needed to sort of

00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:51,760
go back in fact to the very origin of

00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,800
the company right i mean microsoft got

00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:56,079
started

00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:59,520
when we built or paul and bill built

00:43:56,079 --> 00:44:01,920
the basic interpreter for the altair

00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:04,560
and i believe that everything that needs

00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:07,359
to be known about microsoft in 2019 can

00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:09,440
be traced back to our origin

00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:11,280
which is we build technology so that

00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:12,800
others can build more technology

00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:15,119
right i felt like we were doing things

00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:15,839
out of envy and others we needed to get

00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:18,720
back

00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:20,480
to what we our core identity is right

00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:23,119
especially in 2019 where every company

00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:25,119
is a software company around the world

00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:26,960
we can just basically be a software

00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:27,920
platform and tools provider and have a

00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:30,160
good business

00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:31,839
and so i felt let's be proud of who we

00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:32,960
are of course we got to express it

00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:35,680
differently

00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:37,359
uh and and then you know really

00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:39,119
reinforce that that's why we talk about

00:44:37,359 --> 00:44:41,920
our mission around empowering people and

00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:41,920
organizations

00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:46,079
so i thought there was a really you know

00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:47,599
interesting interview

00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:50,400
if you're interested you can watch a

00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:54,000
longer version of this interview

00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:55,680
online but basically you know microsoft

00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:59,839
was sort of reinvigorating

00:44:55,680 --> 00:45:01,359
by refocusing on their roots and

00:44:59,839 --> 00:45:03,200
you know in the interview actually such

00:45:01,359 --> 00:45:04,880
an adela explains how we interviewed

00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:07,359
people that had been

00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:08,720
at microsoft for like 20 years and what

00:45:07,359 --> 00:45:09,839
they answered and there was a whole

00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:12,400
process

00:45:09,839 --> 00:45:14,319
around how they kind of you know

00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:17,119
determined what their roots are

00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:17,839
and what it meant to going back to their

00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:19,359
boots

00:45:17,839 --> 00:45:20,960
and ultimately it meant building

00:45:19,359 --> 00:45:23,359
technologies

00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:25,119
um or technology so that others can

00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:26,079
build more technology and then if you

00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:27,440
look at that

00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:29,839
through the lens of what they've done

00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:32,240
recently like you know they've been

00:45:29,839 --> 00:45:33,839
investing so much in azure as an example

00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:36,400
but they've also about

00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:38,240
github as another example like all of

00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:40,160
their moves or many of their moves are

00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:43,359
really rooted in this notion of

00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:45,280
becoming uh you know or re-becoming if

00:45:43,359 --> 00:45:48,319
that's a word

00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:48,800
a company around building and builders

00:45:48,319 --> 00:45:51,760
again

00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:53,280
right and it's been very successful i

00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:55,440
would say and so that

00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:56,880
made me think about what would it mean

00:45:55,440 --> 00:46:00,400
for drupal to

00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:03,280
return to its roots because it feels

00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:05,359
from observing microsoft as an example

00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:07,280
that that is very powerful thing to do

00:46:05,359 --> 00:46:09,280
and that it can really help like

00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:12,640
strengthen your focus

00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:14,400
or accelerate your momentum or provide

00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:17,520
clarity to a lot of people

00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:19,119
right and so um

00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:20,720
i thought that was a really interesting

00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:23,760
question and got me to think

00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:27,440
like um you know what would it

00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:29,839
take for um you know

00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:31,520
or what did it take for you to fall in

00:46:29,839 --> 00:46:33,440
love with drupal

00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:35,599
um and maybe take a moment to answer

00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:37,520
that question for yourself

00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:38,720
and i don't mean like falling in love

00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:42,000
with drupal after

00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:44,960
a year or two years but like what was it

00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:46,319
that spiked your interest in the early

00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:49,359
or in the beginning

00:46:46,319 --> 00:46:51,040
and what caused that feeling of sort of

00:46:49,359 --> 00:46:54,319
excitement the first feeling of

00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:56,160
excitement and

00:46:54,319 --> 00:46:58,240
you know when i asked people and i asked

00:46:56,160 --> 00:47:00,560
others to ask people as well

00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:01,839
uh you know angie did a tweet about it

00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:04,000
for example

00:47:01,839 --> 00:47:05,119
um what we've learned is that there was

00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:08,480
actually

00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:10,640
a fairly consistent theme in those

00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:12,319
answers you know not one theme

00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:13,040
necessarily but there was definitely a

00:47:12,319 --> 00:47:16,720
very strong

00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:17,119
theme in those answers and my theme was

00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:20,640
that

00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:23,520
drupal's roots are about empowering

00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:24,880
site builders you know and typically

00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:27,920
these site builders are less

00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:30,640
technical um they want to build things

00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:32,319
through the ui and they and they when

00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:34,400
they discovered drupal they felt

00:47:32,319 --> 00:47:35,359
empowered they felt like they could do

00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:39,280
things that they

00:47:35,359 --> 00:47:40,079
could otherwise not do and we also heard

00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:42,880
that

00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:43,920
they love drupal because they could do

00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:45,680
you know sort of

00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:48,480
ambitious things you know things that

00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:50,079
are maybe more complex and more powerful

00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:51,520
than they could do with other tools

00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:53,520
you know this notion of ambitious

00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:56,319
websites that we've talked about

00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:56,720
uh so much and they could do all of this

00:47:56,319 --> 00:47:58,559
with

00:47:56,720 --> 00:48:00,079
sort of a low code or no code or

00:47:58,559 --> 00:48:00,960
whatever you want to call it minimum

00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:04,079
code

00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:07,440
um and that's important nuance too

00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:10,000
because you know a lot of frameworks

00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:12,319
you have to use a lot of code that don't

00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:15,760
allow kind of this assembly

00:48:12,319 --> 00:48:18,400
of of websites right and then maybe on

00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:20,000
the other hand you have sas solutions

00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:22,079
and they don't allow you to write any

00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:24,079
code at all so there's this

00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:25,839
kind of in the middle low code thing

00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:27,440
where you can write some code or a lot

00:48:25,839 --> 00:48:29,359
of code if you want to but the fact that

00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:32,160
you can do so much through a ui

00:48:29,359 --> 00:48:33,760
but then also where needed make

00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:36,559
customizations with

00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:37,280
you know limited codes like maybe an

00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:40,480
altar hook

00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:44,480
or something is really powerful and

00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:46,800
um and actually believe that a lot of

00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:48,720
sort of drupalists and you know here's

00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:51,920
some familiar faces

00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:52,880
um that that's how they actually fell in

00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:54,880
love with drupal

00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:56,319
you know the feeling of feeling

00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:59,359
empowered

00:48:56,319 --> 00:49:01,520
and being able to get things done uh

00:48:59,359 --> 00:49:03,920
very quickly and easily through the ui

00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:04,960
and i think it's a story a lot of people

00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:07,359
i was talking to

00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:08,880
tim for example he's the cto of the

00:49:07,359 --> 00:49:10,880
drupal association and

00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:12,559
he's an english major didn't study

00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:14,000
computer science but he fell in love

00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:15,760
with drupal because

00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:18,640
it allowed him to build these websites

00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:21,839
quickly and even to make some money

00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:23,839
to help pay for college or

00:49:21,839 --> 00:49:25,760
you know we just saw amy june for

00:49:23,839 --> 00:49:26,800
example and she talked about how she was

00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:30,000
a nurse

00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:33,119
and she was also a volkswagen mechanic

00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:35,119
and a school teacher and she's a mom but

00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:38,319
she's not a computer scientist

00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:40,000
by professional training yet

00:49:38,319 --> 00:49:42,079
she's done amazing things with drupal

00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:44,160
and she's doing amazing things

00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:46,000
for the community congratulations by the

00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:48,400
way um

00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,440
and you know i think there is that

00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:52,319
element

00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:52,960
again of empowering people to allow them

00:49:52,319 --> 00:49:56,839
to do

00:49:52,960 --> 00:50:00,720
great things quickly with limited code

00:49:56,839 --> 00:50:03,920
um and if that's drupal's core strengths

00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:06,000
i do feel like uh maybe unfortunately

00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:06,640
the site builder has been the forgotten

00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:09,599
user

00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:11,680
we haven't really focused that much on

00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:13,359
this persona we've done a lot of for

00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:15,599
developers and we've been focused on

00:50:13,359 --> 00:50:18,880
content authors etc etc

00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:19,440
but maybe unfortunately the site builder

00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:22,720
is the

00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:24,720
forgotten user and

00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:26,640
truth to be told i think our

00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:29,359
modernization efforts

00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:31,359
you know added some complexity uh

00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:33,520
whether it's object oriented programming

00:50:31,359 --> 00:50:37,119
composer symphony

00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:40,160
and they added some complexity

00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:42,319
that disadvantaged the site builder

00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:43,599
and to be clear all these things have

00:50:42,319 --> 00:50:45,200
been great for drupal

00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:46,960
they've really empowered backend

00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:49,359
developers they've helped us

00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:50,559
actually evolve how we do releases and

00:50:49,359 --> 00:50:52,400
how we do

00:50:50,559 --> 00:50:54,160
uh upgrades and these upgrades have

00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:56,640
become much easier and

00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:58,079
all of that is part of adopting these

00:50:56,640 --> 00:51:01,599
technologies

00:50:58,079 --> 00:51:03,119
but at the same time despite many of the

00:51:01,599 --> 00:51:05,680
great things about it

00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:08,000
it has disadvantaged the site builder

00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:10,559
for example you hear sometimes that

00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:13,119
you need to have a back-end developer on

00:51:10,559 --> 00:51:15,200
call or on staff when you use drupal 8

00:51:13,119 --> 00:51:17,599
or drupal 9 because the upgrades

00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:19,040
are more complex now and obviously we're

00:51:17,599 --> 00:51:20,800
trying to fix that with automated

00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:23,440
updates but it's an example of how

00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:26,640
drupal has become more complex

00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:28,640
and i don't think anyone is is arguing

00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:31,280
against that it's become more complex

00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:32,960
specifically for site builders

00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:34,640
and having that great site builder

00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:37,280
experience

00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:39,440
for less technical people is really

00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:42,720
important and really valuable

00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:43,599
because i believe everybody benefits

00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:45,440
from that

00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:49,440
you know whether you're a small

00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:51,280
organization or a large organization

00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:52,559
we all benefit from that and sometimes

00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:55,200
people think

00:51:52,559 --> 00:51:57,440
that those ideas around side builders

00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:58,480
are incompatible with enterprise users

00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:01,520
for example

00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:02,960
but that's not true again everybody

00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:05,760
benefits from

00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:06,720
the productivity improvements that site

00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:09,599
builder

00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:10,720
capabilities provide like wysiwyg and

00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:13,200
drag and drop

00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:14,480
and i also believe it extends drupal's

00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:17,520
relevancy

00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:18,960
for all of these audiences so with all

00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:22,079
of that said

00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:23,920
um if our roots are the site builder

00:52:22,079 --> 00:52:25,440
and if there's value in going back to

00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:28,480
our roots

00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:30,079
um you know we should focus on the site

00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:31,280
builder experience and then the question

00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:34,319
becomes how

00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:36,800
what do we have to do to improve

00:52:34,319 --> 00:52:39,599
that site builder experience and so

00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:41,119
that's what i want to talk about right

00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:42,800
what would we do if we could do one

00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:46,480
thing what would it be

00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:48,160
um there's probably 50 great ideas but

00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:50,880
the way i think the thought about it is

00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:53,359
we want to focus on something that

00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:55,920
allows these ambitious experiences to be

00:52:53,359 --> 00:52:59,599
built with low code that's one

00:52:55,920 --> 00:53:04,160
two as we think about what we could do

00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:06,800
i think it's really valuable to um

00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:07,760
you know expose this early in people's

00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:09,680
drupal journey

00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:10,960
you know it's something like something

00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:13,440
that people see in the first

00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:14,000
10 15 minutes and that makes them feel

00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:16,000
empowered

00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:18,079
so early in their drupal journey i think

00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,839
is an important attribute

00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:22,160
and then lastly i think we need to do

00:53:19,839 --> 00:53:24,160
something that's relatively small

00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:25,839
it's doable because we already have a

00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:27,440
lot of things on our plate

00:53:25,839 --> 00:53:29,520
core committers are doing a lot of

00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:31,520
things and so i think we need to find

00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:33,440
something that's relatively small

00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:34,720
hopefully we can do as a contributed

00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:38,240
module

00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:40,800
but still has a very high impact on the

00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:43,119
project right so these are some criteria

00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:44,480
and that got me to think about you know

00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:47,760
what's the first thing

00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:52,079
that all people do after installing

00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:52,960
drupal probably installing a contributed

00:53:52,079 --> 00:53:57,359
module

00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:59,920
right and i think we take for granted

00:53:57,359 --> 00:54:00,480
how hard that can be i think in our

00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:03,680
minds

00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:04,480
it looks something like this um but in

00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:06,400
reality

00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:07,920
if you actually observe what people have

00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:10,880
to do they have to do

00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:11,760
all of these different steps um it's

00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:15,040
quite complex

00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:16,559
actually to find your module

00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:18,960
to figure out if it's going to work on

00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:21,520
your site to then install it

00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:23,280
and and so that initial experience of

00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:26,160
finding a contributed module

00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:27,440
and getting it installed might not be

00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:30,720
love at first sight

00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:32,800
you know pun intended here because the

00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:35,040
first problem that people run into is

00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:36,720
finding the module on drupal.org which

00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:38,480
can be hard to navigate

00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:39,839
can be hard to decide which module

00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:41,920
should i use

00:54:39,839 --> 00:54:43,040
the second problem that many people run

00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:45,680
into is

00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:48,000
composer you know as powerful and

00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:50,799
awesome that composer is

00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:52,319
it doesn't make installing a module easy

00:54:50,799 --> 00:54:54,480
for site builders

00:54:52,319 --> 00:54:56,240
and so i believe we can make this easier

00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:58,640
and so what i would like to propose and

00:54:56,240 --> 00:55:00,400
by the way this is not a new idea

00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:01,760
what i would like to propose is that we

00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:05,599
work on

00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:06,480
a project browser and a project browser

00:55:05,599 --> 00:55:08,400
would be

00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:11,599
functionality that ships with drupal

00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:13,920
core it's part of the drupal admin ui

00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:16,000
and it allows you to browse all of the

00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:18,319
modules available for drupal

00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:20,079
you know thousands of modules make it

00:55:18,319 --> 00:55:21,280
easy to find them and that makes it

00:55:20,079 --> 00:55:24,079
really easy to

00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:25,599
install them as well with one click or

00:55:24,079 --> 00:55:28,559
two clicks you can install

00:55:25,599 --> 00:55:30,559
a module and the reason i really like

00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:32,240
this is because

00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:33,920
again it's something that people get

00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:36,160
exposed to early in their journey it's

00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:38,960
one of the first thing you want to do

00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:41,680
but it could really provide this instant

00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:43,440
and seamless discovery of modules

00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:45,280
and experimentation and i think people

00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:47,920
would feel really empowered

00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:49,359
if they can very easily and quickly kind

00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:52,880
of install some modules

00:55:49,359 --> 00:55:56,240
right but it also makes

00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:57,040
so much sense it almost hurts meaning

00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:59,680
like

00:55:57,040 --> 00:56:00,559
imagine you're an iphone user or you

00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:02,319
know it doesn't matter

00:56:00,559 --> 00:56:03,839
a smartphone user but let's go with the

00:56:02,319 --> 00:56:05,839
iphone

00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:07,680
if you want to install an app on your

00:56:05,839 --> 00:56:10,400
iphone

00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:11,040
you don't go to you don't go to your

00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:15,040
desktop

00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:17,040
open a browser navigate to apple.com

00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:18,400
you know find your app download your app

00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:20,720
and then figure out a way to

00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:21,599
transfer the app from your desktop to

00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:23,760
your iphone

00:56:21,599 --> 00:56:24,799
i mean that's not how you do things what

00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:27,520
you do is

00:56:24,799 --> 00:56:29,359
you open up the app store you know which

00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:30,400
is kind of the equivalent of the project

00:56:29,359 --> 00:56:33,680
browser

00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:34,880
and you find your you know app and

00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:36,880
you know apple makes great

00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:39,520
recommendations etc etc

00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:41,359
and that's how you install an app on

00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:44,079
your iphone and it should be that easy

00:56:41,359 --> 00:56:44,960
to install a module on drupal and in

00:56:44,079 --> 00:56:47,040
fact it's

00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:48,400
you know table stakes if you look at our

00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:49,839
competitors in the

00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:51,680
or some of our competitors in the

00:56:49,839 --> 00:56:53,680
content management space

00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:55,520
they all have it you know wordpress has

00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:58,160
one wix and squarespace and you can see

00:56:55,520 --> 00:57:00,400
the install buttons and the add buttons

00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:02,319
some of these screenshots and in fact

00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:04,960
even some of our own modules

00:57:02,319 --> 00:57:06,720
like the webform module they've kind of

00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:09,680
built their own app store

00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:11,520
just for the web forms ecosystem of

00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:13,440
add-ons which

00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:15,920
you know goes to show that a lot of

00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:18,880
people really see benefit in this and

00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:20,640
and even module owners are going uh

00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:22,720
through the effort to build

00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:23,920
um you know project browsers for their

00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:26,960
extension so

00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:28,559
i also think now is the time i think we

00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:29,599
have a lot of the infrastructure in

00:57:28,559 --> 00:57:32,400
place

00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:34,400
thanks to things like the update status

00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:35,200
module but also automated updates you

00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:37,520
know

00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:38,960
we have package signing we have package

00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:41,760
endpoints we have

00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:43,440
project feeds we have composer uh i

00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:45,680
won't go into all of the details what

00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:47,920
these things are but the point is

00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:49,440
we've actually put together over the

00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:51,520
last few years

00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:54,319
a lot of the infrastructure that you

00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:56,880
need to build a project browser

00:57:54,319 --> 00:57:58,000
and so i feel like we might be able to

00:57:56,880 --> 00:58:00,559
build it

00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:01,520
you know relatively quickly or easily

00:58:00,559 --> 00:58:03,839
there's actually

00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:05,520
already a project browser module that

00:58:03,839 --> 00:58:06,799
might or might not be a good starting

00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:08,319
point

00:58:06,799 --> 00:58:10,160
we can build an income trip and when

00:58:08,319 --> 00:58:12,160
it's ready um

00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:13,280
hopefully we can move it into core you

00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:15,760
know

00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:16,400
and i think it would be a great first

00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:19,359
step

00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:22,079
now will it make for the best possible

00:58:19,359 --> 00:58:24,079
site builder experience in the world no

00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:26,079
we need to do more right but this would

00:58:24,079 --> 00:58:27,920
be a first great step and

00:58:26,079 --> 00:58:29,359
after we've taken this step we can do

00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:31,760
many more things

00:58:29,359 --> 00:58:33,200
so that's what i would like to propose

00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:34,880
um

00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:36,559
what i'm going to do is i'd like to

00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:38,000
create an initiative team

00:58:36,559 --> 00:58:40,640
you know how do you make this actionable

00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:42,319
right like to formalize an initiative

00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:43,839
theme so if you're interested in helping

00:58:42,319 --> 00:58:46,960
with this

00:58:43,839 --> 00:58:49,599
we have an issue for this already you

00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:52,000
can find the number here on the screen

00:58:49,599 --> 00:58:53,359
i'll share my slides today or tomorrow

00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:55,119
as well

00:58:53,359 --> 00:58:56,880
put your name on the issue queue if

00:58:55,119 --> 00:58:58,319
you're interested in being part of the

00:58:56,880 --> 00:59:00,559
initiative team

00:58:58,319 --> 00:59:01,599
and then we'll kick off weekly meetings

00:59:00,559 --> 00:59:04,160
and

00:59:01,599 --> 00:59:06,079
i'll probably run them until we have the

00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:08,720
initiative theme

00:59:06,079 --> 00:59:09,599
formalized but we're going to kick it

00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:12,480
off

00:59:09,599 --> 00:59:13,440
keep an eye out for more updates either

00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:16,400
on my blog

00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:17,280
and drupal.org as well of course and

00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:18,960
yeah let's see

00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:21,200
if we can get this going and as i

00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:22,400
mentioned there's many other steps other

00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:25,280
things we can do

00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:27,520
like personally i think improving the ux

00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:29,280
of a lot of the site builder

00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:31,119
capabilities that we have in drupal

00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:33,200
whether it's views or entities and

00:59:31,119 --> 00:59:35,280
fields or configuration management or

00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:36,400
even paragraphs module as a contributed

00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:38,160
module

00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:39,520
would help a lot as well but they're

00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:42,799
going to take

00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:44,640
more time a different approach maybe

00:59:42,799 --> 00:59:45,520
more resources more likely and that

00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:48,559
might be a better

00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:50,400
thing to focus on like for drupal 11 or

00:59:48,559 --> 00:59:51,599
something but for drupal 10 i think we

00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:54,720
may have a shot

00:59:51,599 --> 00:59:57,599
making some progress at a great

00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:58,960
project browser and that would really

00:59:57,599 --> 01:00:01,760
transform

00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:03,200
um you know how we think about the site

01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:05,760
builder persona

01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:06,559
uh to making things a lot better for

01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:09,280
them and

01:00:06,559 --> 01:00:10,400
would be great to attract new people to

01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:12,240
drupal by

01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:13,680
you know catching them early on if you

01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:15,040
will and making them feel really

01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:16,400
empowered about

01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:19,040
drupal and what they could do with

01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:20,640
drupal and i don't know i'm just excited

01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:23,200
about it so

01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:23,920
let's try and make it happen all right

01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:26,480
so that's

01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:29,200
actually the end of section two um

01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:31,520
there's one section remaining

01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:32,880
which is about getting off the island

01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:34,480
you may be wondering

01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:36,880
what does that mean getting off the

01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:39,440
island so let me start to

01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:39,440
explain

01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:44,240
but first i'd like to you know begin

01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:47,440
here

01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:49,599
and basically acknowledge that we have

01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:50,880
built something really amazing here you

01:00:49,599 --> 01:00:54,000
know we have one of the most

01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:55,760
scalable robust and mature development

01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:58,559
communities in the world

01:00:55,760 --> 01:01:00,160
we have over 10 000 people collaborating

01:00:58,559 --> 01:01:02,960
on drupal

01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:03,599
um every year we have over a thousand

01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:06,240
two hundred

01:01:03,599 --> 01:01:07,119
organizations contributing to drupal

01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:10,880
every year

01:01:07,119 --> 01:01:13,520
i mean our scale is amazing and

01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:15,520
there's not many organizations that have

01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:17,680
the kind of scale and collaboration that

01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:20,000
drupal has

01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:21,040
and to make this kind of collaboration

01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,799
possible like

01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:25,520
how do you work together with 10 000

01:01:22,799 --> 01:01:27,839
people you know we had to put in

01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:29,440
place a lot of different things we had

01:01:27,839 --> 01:01:32,000
to put in place a very modular

01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:36,000
architecture in drupal itself

01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:38,640
but also really powerful collaboration

01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:39,760
tools and processes and testing systems

01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:41,520
and much more

01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:43,520
and it's impressive what we've done i

01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:45,200
think

01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:46,559
you know lots of people have helped with

01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:49,440
this and

01:01:46,559 --> 01:01:50,960
as i said very very few organizations

01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:54,079
have our level of

01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:56,160
rigor and discipline excuse me in

01:01:54,079 --> 01:01:58,880
sophistication

01:01:56,160 --> 01:02:00,400
and a lot of organizations look up to us

01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:04,000
other open source projects

01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:04,000
look up to us about what we've done

01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:08,880
what people may not realize is that we

01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:12,000
had to build a lot of the tooling

01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:13,599
the tooling on drupal.orac on our own

01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:16,559
you know we had to build these things

01:02:13,599 --> 01:02:19,520
ourselves because gitlab or github

01:02:16,559 --> 01:02:21,599
that simply didn't exist when i started

01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:24,319
drupal 20 years ago

01:02:21,599 --> 01:02:25,200
we actually started by emailing each

01:02:24,319 --> 01:02:27,200
other patches

01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:28,880
we were using cvs for those that

01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:31,520
remember and people would create a patch

01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:34,640
and email it to me to me personally

01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:36,400
and uh that was fun for a while but it

01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:38,799
stopped scaling

01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:40,799
and so at that point we decided like

01:02:38,799 --> 01:02:42,640
maybe we should set up a mailing list

01:02:40,799 --> 01:02:44,319
and we can email patches to the mailing

01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:45,839
list and

01:02:44,319 --> 01:02:48,000
that was awesome for a while and that

01:02:45,839 --> 01:02:51,200
stopped scaling and then we said

01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:53,599
well let's maybe move it to

01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:55,280
drupal.org and we started building the

01:02:53,599 --> 01:02:57,760
project module

01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:58,480
where we could have hundreds of projects

01:02:57,760 --> 01:03:00,640
now we have

01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:01,520
you know i think 42 000 or something

01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:03,599
projects

01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:05,359
and we gave every project an issue queue

01:03:03,599 --> 01:03:06,960
or a ticketing system and we built all

01:03:05,359 --> 01:03:10,160
of these things because

01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:12,000
again git lab or github just didn't

01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:14,960
exist and maybe we've even

01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:16,319
you know inspired those projects or

01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:20,160
companies

01:03:16,319 --> 01:03:20,160
to take some of our ideas now

01:03:20,799 --> 01:03:24,640
that's all cool and nice but obviously

01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:26,799
today

01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:29,039
you know it doesn't make a lot of sense

01:03:26,799 --> 01:03:30,240
anymore to build and maintain our own

01:03:29,039 --> 01:03:32,480
collaboration tools

01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:33,359
right gitlab and github have become

01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:36,640
massive

01:03:33,359 --> 01:03:38,720
successful like crazy successful and

01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:40,240
they've become the standard way of doing

01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:42,480
things most developers

01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:44,000
use these tools on a daily basis it's

01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:45,039
they know them inside out it's how they

01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:48,000
work

01:03:45,039 --> 01:03:50,400
and the gitlab and github organizations

01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:52,480
are also extremely well funded

01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:54,559
um and what that means is that they're

01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:57,200
innovating much faster

01:03:54,559 --> 01:03:58,319
than we the drupal project could

01:03:57,200 --> 01:04:01,280
innovate

01:03:58,319 --> 01:04:02,880
our tools on our own right so it doesn't

01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:05,119
make any sense for us to keep building

01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:06,960
and maintaining these tools and so

01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:08,400
a few years ago we set out on this

01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:12,000
journey to

01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:13,680
modernize our tools by adopting gitlab

01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:15,119
we picked gitlab because it's open

01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:17,200
source versus

01:04:15,119 --> 01:04:19,039
you know github is is not open source

01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:22,480
even though git is

01:04:19,039 --> 01:04:24,319
um and we collaborated with gitlab they

01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:25,440
even made some changes to gitlab to

01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:27,839
accommodate

01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:29,359
drupal which is fantastic and and all of

01:04:27,839 --> 01:04:31,119
this work

01:04:29,359 --> 01:04:32,720
um has been done by the drupal

01:04:31,119 --> 01:04:34,079
association

01:04:32,720 --> 01:04:36,000
the drupal association has an

01:04:34,079 --> 01:04:39,599
engineering team uh

01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:41,599
it's small but mighty it's honestly one

01:04:39,599 --> 01:04:43,359
of the best engineering themes i've ever

01:04:41,599 --> 01:04:45,280
seen in my career

01:04:43,359 --> 01:04:47,520
and they do a lot of different things

01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:49,440
not just this they have to juggle

01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:51,599
uh you know various different priorities

01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:53,039
but uh you know they're small but mighty

01:04:51,599 --> 01:04:56,720
and they've delivered

01:04:53,039 --> 01:04:58,240
on adding you know some of gitlab let's

01:04:56,720 --> 01:05:01,119
say and through that

01:04:58,240 --> 01:05:03,119
they've given us really cool new key

01:05:01,119 --> 01:05:06,000
features like in browser editing and

01:05:03,119 --> 01:05:08,400
merch requests etc etc and you know

01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:09,200
many of us will love it because it's

01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:11,599
already

01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:13,200
um a lot better and more powerful than

01:05:11,599 --> 01:05:15,680
anything

01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:17,520
you know we built ourselves before but

01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:19,760
despite a lot of these great

01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:21,599
improvements that allow us to

01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:25,359
collaborate and contribute better

01:05:21,599 --> 01:05:29,440
it's still very difficult for new people

01:05:25,359 --> 01:05:31,520
to make code contributions to drupal

01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:34,000
and we actually tend to scare people

01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:36,240
away sometimes because it's so hard

01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:38,559
to get started with drupal and to

01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:40,079
contribute to drupal and

01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:42,000
that's what i want to talk a little bit

01:05:40,079 --> 01:05:44,079
more about in the remainder of my

01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:45,839
keynote and

01:05:44,079 --> 01:05:47,200
i also picked this topic because you

01:05:45,839 --> 01:05:49,520
know this drupal con

01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:51,680
is about contribution like where we have

01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:52,880
the initiative days and contribution

01:05:51,680 --> 01:05:54,640
afternoons

01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:56,720
and so i felt it was right to dedicate a

01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:59,599
good part of my keynote to this

01:05:56,720 --> 01:06:01,599
uh but i wanted what i want to do for

01:05:59,599 --> 01:06:04,000
the remainder of this keynote is

01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:04,799
this one show you how people expect to

01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:07,280
contribute

01:06:04,799 --> 01:06:09,280
to show you how people are actually

01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:12,480
contributing to drupal today

01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:14,799
specifically new people and then three

01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:16,000
talk about how we're gonna make that

01:06:14,799 --> 01:06:18,640
easier so

01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:19,200
in order to do the first thing to show

01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:21,920
you

01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:23,680
how people expect to contribute let's

01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:25,200
say you've never contributed to drupal

01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:26,799
and you're trying to contribute for the

01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:30,640
first time as hopefully

01:06:26,799 --> 01:06:31,920
many of you are doing this week um

01:06:30,640 --> 01:06:34,079
you know we'll show you that it's not

01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:36,319
always easy but before we show you that

01:06:34,079 --> 01:06:38,559
i wanted to show you what people expect

01:06:36,319 --> 01:06:41,280
to do and in order to do so

01:06:38,559 --> 01:06:42,799
um you know matthew grasmick actually

01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:45,440
created a little video

01:06:42,799 --> 01:06:47,920
that shows that experience and so let's

01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:51,119
play that video now

01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:52,400
you what my symphony contribution

01:06:51,119 --> 01:06:54,319
experience was like

01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:56,960
and point out some of the things that i

01:06:54,319 --> 01:06:58,480
think made it really great

01:06:56,960 --> 01:07:00,000
at the time i was working with symphony

01:06:58,480 --> 01:07:03,280
console and i ran

01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:05,359
into a bug with a progress bar so

01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:06,799
i decided to go to packages to start

01:07:05,359 --> 01:07:07,920
since i use composer to download

01:07:06,799 --> 01:07:10,799
symphony

01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:12,000
i typed in symphony slash console the

01:07:10,799 --> 01:07:14,640
same way i could type in

01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:15,839
drupal slash drupal or drupal core went

01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:20,160
to it

01:07:15,839 --> 01:07:21,839
quickly found the github page for this

01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:23,680
and because i've used github before i'm

01:07:21,839 --> 01:07:25,280
signed in with my github account

01:07:23,680 --> 01:07:27,280
i knew that i could just type in the

01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:28,559
file name where i identified the bug

01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:31,599
locally

01:07:28,559 --> 01:07:32,319
take a look at it click on the edit

01:07:31,599 --> 01:07:35,920
button

01:07:32,319 --> 01:07:37,440
and make a change so in this case i copy

01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:38,160
and pasted some code from my local

01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:40,000
machine

01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:42,720
i'm not going to do that right now but

01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:44,480
let's say i wanted to add a comment

01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:47,280
somewhere

01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:49,440
to show an example of an easy change i'm

01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:52,480
just going to add test here

01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:55,520
propose the change that makes a commit

01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:56,240
it also created a fork for me

01:07:55,520 --> 01:07:59,119
automatically

01:07:56,240 --> 01:07:59,839
created a branch for me automatically

01:07:59,119 --> 01:08:03,200
i'm going to hit

01:07:59,839 --> 01:08:04,720
create pull request looks easy let's do

01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:06,960
it

01:08:04,720 --> 01:08:08,400
and i saw this it said hey thanks for

01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:09,760
your pull request we love contributions

01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:10,720
but this is actually a subtree split

01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:12,480
it's read-only

01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:13,920
don't contribute here contribute over at

01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:16,880
symphony symphony

01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:17,920
okay my mistake but i learned from it

01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:20,480
quickly

01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:22,839
i headed over to symphony symphony and i

01:08:20,480 --> 01:08:26,640
decided to do the same thing

01:08:22,839 --> 01:08:30,000
i first of all i switched to the branch

01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:33,520
that i wanted to make the change on

01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:33,839
i typed in the name of the file where i

01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:38,080
had

01:08:33,839 --> 01:08:40,719
identified the bug clicked edit

01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:42,960
i copy and pasted some changes over in

01:08:40,719 --> 01:08:44,159
this case my change is so small

01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:48,239
in the example that i'm just going to

01:08:44,159 --> 01:08:51,440
type it propose the change

01:08:48,239 --> 01:08:52,560
and pressed create pull request and i

01:08:51,440 --> 01:08:55,359
was greeted with some

01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:57,679
nice things for one i have helpful

01:08:55,359 --> 01:08:59,359
resources here like

01:08:57,679 --> 01:09:01,759
contribution guide code of conduct

01:08:59,359 --> 01:09:03,759
security policy that sort of thing

01:09:01,759 --> 01:09:06,159
i also have a template that's a markdown

01:09:03,759 --> 01:09:08,799
table that's been provided for me

01:09:06,159 --> 01:09:10,159
and it asks me some things that i'm i

01:09:08,799 --> 01:09:12,319
can answer really quickly

01:09:10,159 --> 01:09:14,480
i did answer really quickly so i'm going

01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:18,640
to say the branch is 5-2

01:09:14,480 --> 01:09:20,799
you know it's a bug it's not a feature

01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:23,040
there's no deprecations that i'm aware

01:09:20,799 --> 01:09:24,719
of i didn't make an issue first it's

01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:26,719
nice this says that's fine

01:09:24,719 --> 01:09:28,080
don't make an issue just just put the

01:09:26,719 --> 01:09:30,960
description below

01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:32,560
it's a bug fix i don't need docs uh and

01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:34,400
then i wrote a description

01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:36,640
in this case though i'm going to just

01:09:34,400 --> 01:09:40,880
remove that do test

01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:40,880
and press create pull request

01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:46,960
so there are a few interesting things

01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:48,719
that happen that i'd like to point out

01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:51,679
one is that a reviewer was automatically

01:09:48,719 --> 01:09:53,199
added this uh this user robin shallis

01:09:51,679 --> 01:09:55,280
was added because he's the code owner of

01:09:53,199 --> 01:09:56,640
this particular part of the code

01:09:55,280 --> 01:09:58,560
it's an interesting concept i wasn't

01:09:56,640 --> 01:09:59,679
aware of in github labels were

01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:02,480
automatically added

01:09:59,679 --> 01:10:03,679
it's a bug i presume that's based on the

01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:06,719
table i filled out

01:10:03,679 --> 01:10:08,800
it needs review and also a helpful bot

01:10:06,719 --> 01:10:10,480
commented and said hey i see this is

01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:12,239
your first pr welcome

01:10:10,480 --> 01:10:13,679
here's a contribution guide here are

01:10:12,239 --> 01:10:15,040
some tips

01:10:13,679 --> 01:10:16,480
go ahead and take a look and make sure

01:10:15,040 --> 01:10:17,840
the status checks aren't failing and

01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:19,760
then someone will review it

01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:21,600
and approve it go ahead and sit back and

01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:23,280
wait for reviews cheers

01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:24,880
i thought that was really great i'm

01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:29,440
going to pan over really quickly

01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:30,719
to look at the real pull request

01:10:29,440 --> 01:10:32,560
that i submitted because there's a

01:10:30,719 --> 01:10:34,960
couple things there

01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:37,840
that you won't find here you can see i

01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:40,800
made a few contributions since then

01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:42,000
but inside of the real pull request

01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:44,320
after a couple days

01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:45,679
of the assigned reviewer not actually

01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:48,320
reviewing it

01:10:45,679 --> 01:10:49,760
the bot came back and it said hey

01:10:48,320 --> 01:10:51,120
there's another person that recently

01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:52,960
worked on this code let's ping them

01:10:51,120 --> 01:10:54,000
maybe they can help review

01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:55,040
it turns out they weren't actually the

01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,400
person that reviewed it either but

01:10:55,040 --> 01:10:58,800
someone else came in

01:10:56,400 --> 01:11:00,239
they started collaborating i worked on

01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:02,960
tests and eventually

01:11:00,239 --> 01:11:03,520
i got it merged something that's also

01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:06,080
not

01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:07,360
visible here but it's visible on open

01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:10,800
pull requests

01:11:07,360 --> 01:11:12,880
is uh the status of these things

01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:14,239
it's very easy for me when there's a

01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:15,760
failing test to figure out what's

01:11:14,239 --> 01:11:16,719
failing and look at the log output so

01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:18,800
for instance

01:11:16,719 --> 01:11:20,480
uh you know you can see who's waiting to

01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:22,320
review it but on github i can also see

01:11:20,480 --> 01:11:24,800
all of symphony's various tests

01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:26,000
i can see what's failing i remember when

01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:28,080
i first

01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:30,159
submitted a travis test it failed so i

01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:32,719
went in i looked at the travis build

01:11:30,159 --> 01:11:34,080
got the output great interface for this

01:11:32,719 --> 01:11:35,760
this is something i've always struggled

01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:36,080
with with drupal core is figuring out

01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:38,159
like

01:11:36,080 --> 01:11:39,920
what test is failing where the test how

01:11:38,159 --> 01:11:41,440
do i reproduce it where is the log

01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:43,520
output

01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:44,960
and that's about it you know all in all

01:11:43,520 --> 01:11:48,159
this change

01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:50,480
was merged i've had two other changes

01:11:48,159 --> 01:11:52,159
merged since then they've been released

01:11:50,480 --> 01:11:55,040
and it was a really easy

01:11:52,159 --> 01:11:57,760
process so i'm continuing to contribute

01:11:55,040 --> 01:11:57,760
to symphony

01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:03,120
awesome um pretty cool video there's a

01:12:01,360 --> 01:12:05,600
lot to like i think you know one of the

01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:08,640
parts that i really liked is where

01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:11,360
um the bot basically automatically knows

01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:12,159
who the maintainers of that component

01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:15,760
let's say

01:12:12,159 --> 01:12:18,480
and makes that person a reviewer and

01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:21,040
when the reviewer isn't responsive

01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:22,800
another bot or maybe it's the same bot

01:12:21,040 --> 01:12:25,440
basically looks up the name of the

01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:26,080
person that was the last person to

01:12:25,440 --> 01:12:29,040
change

01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:30,640
the same line of code that matthew was

01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:32,640
trying to change

01:12:30,640 --> 01:12:35,040
and automatically recommended that

01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:37,920
person to be a reviewer and so

01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:39,360
you know lots of little or not so little

01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:42,239
features that

01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:42,640
uh make that experience of contributing

01:12:42,239 --> 01:12:44,640
um

01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:45,760
you know really you know intuitive and

01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:47,920
pleasant

01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:50,719
uh but these examples aside i think the

01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:53,760
real point is because

01:12:50,719 --> 01:12:56,159
github and gitlab are

01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:57,920
used by you know most developers it's

01:12:56,159 --> 01:12:58,560
how people expect things to work you

01:12:57,920 --> 01:13:01,360
know it's how

01:12:58,560 --> 01:13:03,360
open source works today and it's what

01:13:01,360 --> 01:13:06,719
people come to expect so

01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:08,159
um in the second video we're going to

01:13:06,719 --> 01:13:11,120
see matthew again

01:13:08,159 --> 01:13:11,520
and he's going to contribute to drupal

01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:13,920
right

01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:16,080
instead of contributing to symphony he's

01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:17,920
going to contribute to drupal

01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:20,000
and we're going gonna show that as well

01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:20,640
and the entire video is actually too

01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:23,360
long

01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:26,239
so i can't show it in full uh but i will

01:13:23,360 --> 01:13:28,960
post a full video on my personal blog

01:13:26,239 --> 01:13:30,960
and what i'll show you now is a video of

01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:33,040
matthew contributing to drupal

01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:36,159
sort of you know the shortened version

01:13:33,040 --> 01:13:39,120
of that so let's play that video

01:13:36,159 --> 01:13:40,800
try to contribute to drupal core using

01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:42,320
the same set of assumptions that i use

01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:44,800
to contribute to symphony

01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:46,159
and see how it goes all right so just

01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:47,760
like when i was contributing to symphony

01:13:46,159 --> 01:13:49,760
i'm going to start at packages.org

01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:52,080
because of course i installed

01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:54,000
drupal with composer i'm going to type

01:13:52,080 --> 01:13:56,719
drupal slash core

01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:57,840
find it really easily jump over to

01:13:56,719 --> 01:13:59,840
github

01:13:57,840 --> 01:14:01,360
that's listed as the canonical

01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:03,360
repository

01:14:01,360 --> 01:14:04,400
let's say i select the correct branch

01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:06,719
9x2x

01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:08,880
i know enough to do that and let's say

01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:12,000
that i just want to make an arbitrary

01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:12,880
change in real life it would be a code

01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,960
change but

01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:16,080
let's just make a text file change again

01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:19,280
to make this easy

01:14:16,080 --> 01:14:21,840
so i'm going to pop open update.text and

01:14:19,280 --> 01:14:25,120
i'm just going to add a test string up

01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:29,040
here so propose the change

01:14:25,120 --> 01:14:32,080
great easy create the pull request um

01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:35,120
press create and i'm done

01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:36,480
so of course you and i know that no

01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:37,120
tests are going to run here no bot's

01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:39,520
going to come

01:14:37,120 --> 01:14:40,640
and no one's going to review this change

01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:42,000
it's not going to get merged

01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:44,719
there's a few reasons for that one is

01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:47,280
because github is not where

01:14:44,719 --> 01:14:48,640
drupal development happens although a

01:14:47,280 --> 01:14:50,400
lot of developers might

01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:52,239
come to github to find drupal or to

01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:54,560
packageist

01:14:52,239 --> 01:14:55,360
another is that this is a subtree split

01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:58,400
just like

01:14:55,360 --> 01:15:01,360
uh symphony console was however if i go

01:14:58,400 --> 01:15:04,480
to drupal recommended

01:15:01,360 --> 01:15:07,040
which is the the parents i think

01:15:04,480 --> 01:15:08,239
uh that depends that has a dependency

01:15:07,040 --> 01:15:10,000
for core that's not gonna help me out

01:15:08,239 --> 01:15:11,199
either so let's just imagine a few

01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:13,600
months go by

01:15:11,199 --> 01:15:14,400
a few weeks a few days whatever no one

01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:15,840
answers and

01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:17,679
but i really want to contribute this

01:15:15,840 --> 01:15:20,159
change upstream so

01:15:17,679 --> 01:15:21,520
take a long shot go to drupal.org and

01:15:20,159 --> 01:15:24,320
say i want to figure this out

01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:25,520
where do i contribute so i i did figure

01:15:24,320 --> 01:15:27,360
it out but it took me a while to figure

01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:30,719
out i don't go to

01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:34,320
try drupal or resources

01:15:30,719 --> 01:15:36,880
um i go to build and there's a browse

01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:39,440
repository presumably that's the or

01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:42,560
sorry the drupal core repository

01:15:39,440 --> 01:15:44,400
um and if i want to make a change i'm

01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:46,719
going to navigate into the core sub

01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:48,800
directory

01:15:46,719 --> 01:15:52,480
and i'm going to go to the same file i

01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:55,199
changed before update.txt use the nice

01:15:52,480 --> 01:15:57,760
git lab edit button

01:15:55,199 --> 01:15:59,760
but i get an error right so even though

01:15:57,760 --> 01:16:02,480
even if i were to sign into gitlab

01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:04,159
or github in this browser it's not going

01:16:02,480 --> 01:16:06,800
to help me actually make a change to

01:16:04,159 --> 01:16:06,800
drupal.org

01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:21,840
lab

01:16:40,320 --> 01:16:43,920
also i guess the change that i made is

01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:46,640
just gone click edit

01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:47,920
you're not allowed to edit files please

01:16:46,640 --> 01:16:51,600
fork it

01:16:47,920 --> 01:16:53,199
okay i'm gonna fork it you tried to fork

01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:56,560
project drupal but it failed because the

01:16:53,199 --> 01:17:03,840
name space is not valid

01:16:56,560 --> 01:17:03,840
i don't know what that means

01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:17,520
when i probably give up um

01:17:16,080 --> 01:17:19,520
because i'm a member of the drupal

01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:31,840
community i have an idea of something

01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:31,840
else that i could do

01:17:35,560 --> 01:17:44,560
[Music]

01:17:45,040 --> 01:17:48,239
okay i don't really know what to do next

01:17:46,560 --> 01:17:49,120
there's no tests or anything running

01:17:48,239 --> 01:17:51,600
here

01:17:49,120 --> 01:17:54,000
uh and i don't know who would merge it

01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:55,920
or when

01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:57,199
i happen to know from experience that if

01:17:55,920 --> 01:17:58,400
i go back

01:17:57,199 --> 01:18:00,800
if i click the issue it'll actually take

01:17:58,400 --> 01:18:12,240
me back to drupal.org

01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:15,380
and the tests are here

01:18:12,240 --> 01:18:15,380
[Music]

01:18:18,159 --> 01:18:21,360
you know generally to summarize this has

01:18:20,159 --> 01:18:24,960
been a

01:18:21,360 --> 01:18:27,520
kind of frustrating experience trying

01:18:24,960 --> 01:18:29,520
three or four different ways to attack

01:18:27,520 --> 01:18:30,400
the problem of contributing a one-line

01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:32,960
change

01:18:30,400 --> 01:18:33,920
uh to drupal core and in the end i think

01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:36,800
i figured it out

01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:37,679
by first going to the drupal project on

01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:40,080
drupal.org

01:18:37,679 --> 01:18:41,360
then making an issue then making a fork

01:18:40,080 --> 01:18:42,880
then creating a merge request then

01:18:41,360 --> 01:18:46,400
making the change

01:18:42,880 --> 01:18:50,719
then coming back to drupal.org finding

01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:53,280
a test run that seems appropriate

01:18:50,719 --> 01:18:54,000
and then waiting for it i'm not sure

01:18:53,280 --> 01:18:56,640
what the next steps

01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:59,199
are i don't know if someone's going to

01:18:56,640 --> 01:18:59,199
review this

01:19:00,239 --> 01:19:06,640
all right um i'm not sure if i'm back

01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:07,520
yeah there we are so funny not funny i

01:19:06,640 --> 01:19:11,040
would say

01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:13,199
um it was actually

01:19:11,040 --> 01:19:14,880
really fun to go through this with

01:19:13,199 --> 01:19:17,920
matthew

01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:19,280
and it was hard to show this video

01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:22,159
you know i thought about should i show

01:19:19,280 --> 01:19:25,280
this video or not because uh

01:19:22,159 --> 01:19:27,840
it's a it's painful but um

01:19:25,280 --> 01:19:30,080
it's painful but not unfair to show and

01:19:27,840 --> 01:19:33,520
so i decided i should show it

01:19:30,080 --> 01:19:35,280
um if anything it's a useful exercise or

01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:37,040
it's useful to teach you how to

01:19:35,280 --> 01:19:38,159
contribute and how to get over the

01:19:37,040 --> 01:19:41,360
hurdles

01:19:38,159 --> 01:19:44,400
um as i mentioned i'll share the whole

01:19:41,360 --> 01:19:46,880
video it's i think it's maybe 25 minutes

01:19:44,400 --> 01:19:49,280
or so and we had to reduce it to six

01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:50,000
ish and i know i'm spending a lot of

01:19:49,280 --> 01:19:52,640
time on this

01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:54,640
in this reason but again it's the theme

01:19:52,640 --> 01:19:58,320
of the conference in a way so

01:19:54,640 --> 01:20:00,560
anyhow despite a lot of the great work

01:19:58,320 --> 01:20:02,640
that the drupal association has done and

01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:05,360
they have done a lot of great work

01:20:02,640 --> 01:20:06,320
they haven't had a chance to really uh

01:20:05,360 --> 01:20:08,080
focus on that

01:20:06,320 --> 01:20:09,360
beginner experience at initial

01:20:08,080 --> 01:20:11,199
contributor and

01:20:09,360 --> 01:20:12,400
optimizing for these workflows so if

01:20:11,199 --> 01:20:15,440
you're an existing

01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:17,360
or long-term drupal contributor all of

01:20:15,440 --> 01:20:19,920
the new features are awesome

01:20:17,360 --> 01:20:21,440
and and really a big improvement but if

01:20:19,920 --> 01:20:23,600
you're new to drupal

01:20:21,440 --> 01:20:24,800
um that's not necessarily the case so

01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:27,199
obviously

01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:28,480
what we want to do here is we want to

01:20:27,199 --> 01:20:31,600
adopt

01:20:28,480 --> 01:20:35,920
gitlab in its fullest we want to go all

01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:38,719
in um you know use every feature of it

01:20:35,920 --> 01:20:39,520
where it makes sense um but we want to

01:20:38,719 --> 01:20:42,719
do so

01:20:39,520 --> 01:20:45,040
thoughtfully right so like we want to

01:20:42,719 --> 01:20:47,199
maintain all of the key features that we

01:20:45,040 --> 01:20:49,600
have in our community

01:20:47,199 --> 01:20:51,600
that make us work together so well and

01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:53,600
that allows us to scale and

01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:55,679
allow us to do what we do and so

01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:59,360
examples would be the credit system

01:20:55,679 --> 01:21:01,440
um it's it's where we're really

01:20:59,360 --> 01:21:02,480
leading the world here with the credit

01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:04,960
system and

01:21:02,480 --> 01:21:07,040
and and you know tracking how people

01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:09,840
contribute to drupal who contributes

01:21:07,040 --> 01:21:10,960
to drupal how innovation happens and

01:21:09,840 --> 01:21:12,800
also doing

01:21:10,960 --> 01:21:15,040
or giving credit along the way you know

01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:17,120
giving credit is important

01:21:15,040 --> 01:21:18,560
understanding how our community works is

01:21:17,120 --> 01:21:19,679
important we don't want to lose the

01:21:18,560 --> 01:21:22,800
credit system

01:21:19,679 --> 01:21:23,840
it's a really important aspect of our

01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:25,840
community

01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:28,080
and it helps us you know grow and

01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:30,159
sustain and scale the project

01:21:28,080 --> 01:21:31,840
same thing maybe with the tools that we

01:21:30,159 --> 01:21:32,960
use to do release management and

01:21:31,840 --> 01:21:36,480
packaging

01:21:32,960 --> 01:21:39,360
or the tools that we have to do update

01:21:36,480 --> 01:21:41,520
notifications and update status but then

01:21:39,360 --> 01:21:43,520
there's other things

01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:45,199
that we've built for ourselves that

01:21:43,520 --> 01:21:47,280
maybe aren't unique

01:21:45,199 --> 01:21:50,080
to what we do and examples could be the

01:21:47,280 --> 01:21:54,719
tickets or the issues themselves

01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:57,440
or how we run our test runners you know

01:21:54,719 --> 01:21:58,080
but those things we want to adopt gitlab

01:21:57,440 --> 01:21:59,600
for

01:21:58,080 --> 01:22:01,440
you know the things that aren't unique

01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:03,520
to drupal that don't really add

01:22:01,440 --> 01:22:05,040
much value we definitely want to use

01:22:03,520 --> 01:22:06,800
gitlab instead

01:22:05,040 --> 01:22:08,320
and that would allow us to focus on the

01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:10,960
things that are unique to us

01:22:08,320 --> 01:22:11,520
and stop doing things that aren't unique

01:22:10,960 --> 01:22:14,719
to us

01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:18,000
and allow us to focus uh some more so

01:22:14,719 --> 01:22:21,280
um for the next session um

01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:23,760
i actually wanted to uh show you

01:22:21,280 --> 01:22:24,400
another video i was you know talking to

01:22:23,760 --> 01:22:26,639
tim

01:22:24,400 --> 01:22:28,480
lennon our cto or cto at the drupal

01:22:26,639 --> 01:22:30,880
association quite a bit

01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:32,159
and um you know we would meet weekly

01:22:30,880 --> 01:22:35,600
actually about this

01:22:32,159 --> 01:22:38,320
for some time and i asked

01:22:35,600 --> 01:22:39,120
tim to put together some thoughts in a

01:22:38,320 --> 01:22:41,679
video

01:22:39,120 --> 01:22:42,239
and i'm gonna show you uh that video

01:22:41,679 --> 01:22:45,600
next

01:22:42,239 --> 01:22:47,520
so let's uh play that video

01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:48,800
thank you dries thanks to matt for

01:22:47,520 --> 01:22:49,679
putting on the persona of a new

01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:51,360
contributor

01:22:49,679 --> 01:22:54,080
and putting this comparison together for

01:22:51,360 --> 01:22:55,760
us it can be difficult to see the forest

01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:58,239
for the trees when we're so used to an

01:22:55,760 --> 01:23:00,159
existing contribution workflow

01:22:58,239 --> 01:23:01,679
to us it's second nature to start a

01:23:00,159 --> 01:23:04,000
drupal contribution by using our

01:23:01,679 --> 01:23:05,679
drupal.org accounts to open an issue

01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:07,440
but as matt demonstrated a new

01:23:05,679 --> 01:23:08,960
contributor to drupal is going to follow

01:23:07,440 --> 01:23:10,239
the patterns they've learned from other

01:23:08,960 --> 01:23:11,760
projects

01:23:10,239 --> 01:23:14,000
so what can we do to improve the new

01:23:11,760 --> 01:23:16,639
contributor experience

01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:18,159
fortunately we have a path forward by

01:23:16,639 --> 01:23:19,600
building on our existing gitlab

01:23:18,159 --> 01:23:21,360
integration and accelerating the

01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:23,199
replacement of drupal.org features with

01:23:21,360 --> 01:23:25,280
their gitlab counterparts

01:23:23,199 --> 01:23:27,840
as i watched matt's video i grouped his

01:23:25,280 --> 01:23:29,600
findings into several categories

01:23:27,840 --> 01:23:31,280
first category is discovery there are

01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:32,960
now multiple entry points that a

01:23:31,280 --> 01:23:34,480
potential contributor to drupal might

01:23:32,960 --> 01:23:35,679
find when trying to make their first

01:23:34,480 --> 01:23:38,159
contribution

01:23:35,679 --> 01:23:39,520
these might be packageist the github

01:23:38,159 --> 01:23:42,000
mirror for drupal

01:23:39,520 --> 01:23:43,520
the gitlab repository that we host or

01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:45,120
drupal.org itself

01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:46,560
from each of these we need to ensure

01:23:45,120 --> 01:23:49,120
that the contributor finds a

01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:51,199
valid path to contribution and gets

01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:52,880
gently redirected if they go astray the

01:23:51,199 --> 01:23:55,040
solution to this is going to be

01:23:52,880 --> 01:23:56,719
putting in place in place guidance on

01:23:55,040 --> 01:23:59,199
these third-party entry points

01:23:56,719 --> 01:24:00,880
with strong documentation and helpful

01:23:59,199 --> 01:24:02,800
bots that can redirect users to the

01:24:00,880 --> 01:24:04,960
right spot the second category

01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:06,880
is account management and authentication

01:24:04,960 --> 01:24:10,000
most potential contributors will already

01:24:06,880 --> 01:24:11,280
have a github or gitlab.com account

01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:13,360
having to create a new account on

01:24:11,280 --> 01:24:15,280
drupal.org is an extra step

01:24:13,360 --> 01:24:16,800
if possible we should simplify this

01:24:15,280 --> 01:24:18,560
extra step to a one-click

01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:20,320
process so that if user already has one

01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:21,679
of those accounts they can use that

01:24:20,320 --> 01:24:23,600
existing account to create their

01:24:21,679 --> 01:24:25,840
drupal.org profile and authenticate

01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:27,360
the solution here is to develop a single

01:24:25,840 --> 01:24:28,800
sign-on authentication system for

01:24:27,360 --> 01:24:30,639
drupal.org

01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:32,560
and our gitlab instance that can use

01:24:30,639 --> 01:24:35,360
these existing contributor accounts from

01:24:32,560 --> 01:24:38,000
sources like github.com or getback.com

01:24:35,360 --> 01:24:38,639
the third category that matt discovered

01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:41,040
is

01:24:38,639 --> 01:24:42,000
change first versus issue first

01:24:41,040 --> 01:24:43,920
contribution

01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:45,760
in matt's example a new contributor

01:24:43,920 --> 01:24:46,960
initiates their contribution by using

01:24:45,760 --> 01:24:48,480
the code editor

01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:50,639
and is directed into opening the

01:24:48,480 --> 01:24:52,400
appropriate merge request in symfony the

01:24:50,639 --> 01:24:54,000
contributor's not required to start an

01:24:52,400 --> 01:24:56,400
issue to begin their contribution

01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:57,360
this is inverted 180 degrees from how we

01:24:56,400 --> 01:24:59,440
work in drupal

01:24:57,360 --> 01:25:01,120
in drupal we always start from the issue

01:24:59,440 --> 01:25:03,120
and not from the code change

01:25:01,120 --> 01:25:04,560
but that pattern likely doesn't match

01:25:03,120 --> 01:25:06,320
what contributors expect

01:25:04,560 --> 01:25:07,760
whether a user starts from the code

01:25:06,320 --> 01:25:09,360
change or from an issue

01:25:07,760 --> 01:25:11,440
they should be able to initiate their

01:25:09,360 --> 01:25:13,440
contribution the solution

01:25:11,440 --> 01:25:15,120
is to allow contribution directly from

01:25:13,440 --> 01:25:16,960
the gitlab ide

01:25:15,120 --> 01:25:19,199
opening merge requests even without

01:25:16,960 --> 01:25:21,120
attached issues to do this we may need

01:25:19,199 --> 01:25:23,199
to use gitlab's issues rather than

01:25:21,120 --> 01:25:24,880
drupal.org's custom issue tracker

01:25:23,199 --> 01:25:26,880
for its tighter integration between get

01:25:24,880 --> 01:25:28,800
gitlab collaboration features and issue

01:25:26,880 --> 01:25:29,440
management this is also going to mean

01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:31,520
that we're going to

01:25:29,440 --> 01:25:33,440
need to use solutions like gitlab scoped

01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:35,120
labels to handle the metadata that's

01:25:33,440 --> 01:25:35,760
currently used to organize the core

01:25:35,120 --> 01:25:38,400
issue queue

01:25:35,760 --> 01:25:39,280
the fourth category is waiting for test

01:25:38,400 --> 01:25:40,960
results

01:25:39,280 --> 01:25:43,120
after matt makes his contribution he

01:25:40,960 --> 01:25:44,719
goes back to look for his test results

01:25:43,120 --> 01:25:46,239
first realizing that they're posted to

01:25:44,719 --> 01:25:47,280
the drupal.org issue and not to the

01:25:46,239 --> 01:25:48,960
merge request

01:25:47,280 --> 01:25:50,800
and then having having to stumble

01:25:48,960 --> 01:25:52,960
through a user interface that offers

01:25:50,800 --> 01:25:54,560
too many options to click and doesn't

01:25:52,960 --> 01:25:56,480
make it clear that actually he's just

01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:58,320
waiting for the test results to complete

01:25:56,480 --> 01:25:59,920
it doesn't help that drupal core tests

01:25:58,320 --> 01:26:00,880
currently take almost an hour and a half

01:25:59,920 --> 01:26:03,440
to complete

01:26:00,880 --> 01:26:04,880
even with dedicated 32 core machines for

01:26:03,440 --> 01:26:07,440
each test run spun up on

01:26:04,880 --> 01:26:09,679
aws the solution for this is to move to

01:26:07,440 --> 01:26:11,520
gitlab ci and pipelines for continuous

01:26:09,679 --> 01:26:13,520
integration in the drupal project

01:26:11,520 --> 01:26:14,880
for its tight integration between test

01:26:13,520 --> 01:26:16,239
results and gitlab issues

01:26:14,880 --> 01:26:18,000
we also need to work with core

01:26:16,239 --> 01:26:19,679
contributors to optimize the speed of

01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,800
running drupal core tests so that they

01:26:19,679 --> 01:26:22,560
can complete faster

01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:24,000
finally the last and perhaps most

01:26:22,560 --> 01:26:26,080
important category

01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:28,239
is just improving user experience and

01:26:26,080 --> 01:26:29,679
removing drupalisms there are key user

01:26:28,239 --> 01:26:31,280
experience questions that go

01:26:29,679 --> 01:26:33,199
unanswered in matt's contribution

01:26:31,280 --> 01:26:34,480
attempt where's the right place to start

01:26:33,199 --> 01:26:36,080
my contribution

01:26:34,480 --> 01:26:38,880
am i following the right contribution

01:26:36,080 --> 01:26:41,199
process when will i have my test results

01:26:38,880 --> 01:26:42,639
who will review my changes what does the

01:26:41,199 --> 01:26:44,719
term issue fork mean

01:26:42,639 --> 01:26:46,159
and are those gray bubbles test results

01:26:44,719 --> 01:26:46,800
what about all these other links on the

01:26:46,159 --> 01:26:48,159
page

01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:50,159
in the interest of providing all the

01:26:48,159 --> 01:26:51,840
data someone might possibly want we

01:26:50,159 --> 01:26:52,800
often make it too easy to go down the

01:26:51,840 --> 01:26:55,040
wrong path

01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:56,480
solution here is to leverage tools like

01:26:55,040 --> 01:26:57,840
the support bots and automatic

01:26:56,480 --> 01:26:59,040
assignment rules that we saw in the

01:26:57,840 --> 01:27:01,199
symfony example

01:26:59,040 --> 01:27:03,440
to show new contributors the ropes to

01:27:01,199 --> 01:27:05,360
assign reviewers for code changes

01:27:03,440 --> 01:27:07,600
and to communicate the next steps on a

01:27:05,360 --> 01:27:09,679
given issue so how will we get there

01:27:07,600 --> 01:27:11,760
by accelerating the migration to gitlab

01:27:09,679 --> 01:27:13,120
we can address each of these issues

01:27:11,760 --> 01:27:14,719
and build on the improvements we've

01:27:13,120 --> 01:27:16,800
already made in the last year the

01:27:14,719 --> 01:27:19,120
roadmap for these improvements will be

01:27:16,800 --> 01:27:20,239
about nine months long assuming that we

01:27:19,120 --> 01:27:22,239
can fully dedicate

01:27:20,239 --> 01:27:24,080
two of the da engineering team members

01:27:22,239 --> 01:27:26,080
and unfortunately we already had a full

01:27:24,080 --> 01:27:27,920
road map plan for 2021

01:27:26,080 --> 01:27:29,520
with many other important priorities

01:27:27,920 --> 01:27:31,120
that's why immediately following

01:27:29,520 --> 01:27:32,800
drupalcon we'll be starting a search

01:27:31,120 --> 01:27:33,679
process for new candidates to join the

01:27:32,800 --> 01:27:35,520
engineering team

01:27:33,679 --> 01:27:37,360
with one hire we hope to be able to

01:27:35,520 --> 01:27:38,159
complete these improvements in about 14

01:27:37,360 --> 01:27:39,920
months

01:27:38,159 --> 01:27:41,199
with two hires we believe we should be

01:27:39,920 --> 01:27:42,719
able to complete that gitlab

01:27:41,199 --> 01:27:44,320
acceleration in only nine

01:27:42,719 --> 01:27:46,000
we're confident in our ability to make

01:27:44,320 --> 01:27:47,520
the first hire quickly and we're talking

01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,560
to partners who can help support the

01:27:47,520 --> 01:27:50,000
second hire

01:27:48,560 --> 01:27:51,440
if you're interested in supporting this

01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,159
work please reach out to the drupal

01:27:51,440 --> 01:27:55,280
association

01:27:52,159 --> 01:27:56,960
at drupal.org contact if the initiative

01:27:55,280 --> 01:27:58,639
that dries proposed earlier today

01:27:56,960 --> 01:28:00,400
is about making it possible to fall in

01:27:58,639 --> 01:28:01,760
love with drupal then i would say that

01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:03,280
this initiative is about making it

01:28:01,760 --> 01:28:06,880
possible to fall in love with drupal

01:28:03,280 --> 01:28:06,880
contribution let's get there together

01:28:07,520 --> 01:28:13,199
awesome um great video um

01:28:11,120 --> 01:28:15,280
obviously this is very important uh

01:28:13,199 --> 01:28:16,800
stuff

01:28:15,280 --> 01:28:18,880
you know i think we have a good plan you

01:28:16,800 --> 01:28:19,920
started in in tim's video we know what

01:28:18,880 --> 01:28:21,679
to do

01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:22,960
we know how to do it we know how to

01:28:21,679 --> 01:28:24,639
sequence it

01:28:22,960 --> 01:28:26,480
the challenge is that with the current

01:28:24,639 --> 01:28:29,679
staffing it would take

01:28:26,480 --> 01:28:31,280
you know two years um maybe even more

01:28:29,679 --> 01:28:34,480
than two years to get there

01:28:31,280 --> 01:28:34,960
which you know as the drupal association

01:28:34,480 --> 01:28:37,600
board

01:28:34,960 --> 01:28:38,960
and the staff we didn't feel great about

01:28:37,600 --> 01:28:41,040
you know we want to do more

01:28:38,960 --> 01:28:42,560
and we want to do it faster and again we

01:28:41,040 --> 01:28:44,880
know what to do and so

01:28:42,560 --> 01:28:46,880
as tim explained we're looking to expand

01:28:44,880 --> 01:28:48,239
the capacity of the engineering team

01:28:46,880 --> 01:28:50,800
specifically

01:28:48,239 --> 01:28:52,320
we would like to add two developers and

01:28:50,800 --> 01:28:54,719
a project manager

01:28:52,320 --> 01:28:56,480
and we're looking for you know help to

01:28:54,719 --> 01:28:59,840
achieve this you know whether it's

01:28:56,480 --> 01:29:01,920
you know borrowing engineers or project

01:28:59,840 --> 01:29:03,679
managers or making a donation a

01:29:01,920 --> 01:29:05,360
financial contribution to the drupal

01:29:03,679 --> 01:29:07,199
association

01:29:05,360 --> 01:29:09,120
we're going to be focused on this in the

01:29:07,199 --> 01:29:11,920
next few weeks and hopefully

01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:14,960
we can start sort of expanding our team

01:29:11,920 --> 01:29:17,920
uh shortly after drupalcon if you have

01:29:14,960 --> 01:29:19,120
the ability to help please do contact me

01:29:17,920 --> 01:29:22,639
or head the rocker

01:29:19,120 --> 01:29:24,960
and uh yeah we would love to chat so um

01:29:22,639 --> 01:29:26,880
you know let's replace more of our tools

01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:29,040
with gitlab you know i think

01:29:26,880 --> 01:29:30,080
um it will allow us to attract more

01:29:29,040 --> 01:29:32,719
contributors

01:29:30,080 --> 01:29:33,280
also part-time contributors people that

01:29:32,719 --> 01:29:35,760
um

01:29:33,280 --> 01:29:36,639
just maybe like in matthew's video want

01:29:35,760 --> 01:29:38,560
to make a quick

01:29:36,639 --> 01:29:40,639
one-time contribution to drupal it

01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:42,560
should be easy

01:29:40,639 --> 01:29:44,400
i think it will benefit everyone whether

01:29:42,560 --> 01:29:46,800
you're a long-term contributor

01:29:44,400 --> 01:29:49,199
or just getting started with drupal that

01:29:46,800 --> 01:29:52,239
will all lead to more innovation

01:29:49,199 --> 01:29:53,440
faster innovation and also us getting

01:29:52,239 --> 01:29:55,679
off the island

01:29:53,440 --> 01:29:56,719
uh that's the getting of the island part

01:29:55,679 --> 01:29:59,280
in the title

01:29:56,719 --> 01:30:00,560
uh getting rid of our drupalisms and

01:29:59,280 --> 01:30:03,199
embracing what

01:30:00,560 --> 01:30:04,880
other organizations and people do so you

01:30:03,199 --> 01:30:07,199
know in terms of next steps the

01:30:04,880 --> 01:30:10,080
drupal association will you know

01:30:07,199 --> 01:30:12,080
obviously lead this transition to gitlab

01:30:10,080 --> 01:30:13,440
they do need more capacity and we're

01:30:12,080 --> 01:30:16,159
looking for help there

01:30:13,440 --> 01:30:17,600
and secondly i think as the community of

01:30:16,159 --> 01:30:19,920
contributors

01:30:17,600 --> 01:30:21,520
i would like to call on those people

01:30:19,920 --> 01:30:22,880
interested in helping with the project

01:30:21,520 --> 01:30:25,920
browser

01:30:22,880 --> 01:30:28,239
uh let's go build that and i think um

01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:30,080
you know just to wrap it up here i think

01:30:28,239 --> 01:30:32,080
let's keep up the momentum that we have

01:30:30,080 --> 01:30:34,159
with drupal 9 and the adoption of drupal

01:30:32,080 --> 01:30:35,199
9 let's keep working on the drupal 10

01:30:34,159 --> 01:30:36,880
initiatives

01:30:35,199 --> 01:30:39,440
those five initiatives are really

01:30:36,880 --> 01:30:42,239
important we feel really good about it

01:30:39,440 --> 01:30:44,400
we're making good progress overall we do

01:30:42,239 --> 01:30:47,280
need more help to finish them on time

01:30:44,400 --> 01:30:48,560
for the drupal 10 deadlines but then in

01:30:47,280 --> 01:30:51,280
addition to

01:30:48,560 --> 01:30:52,880
let's add a sixth initiative let's get

01:30:51,280 --> 01:30:54,880
that off the ground

01:30:52,880 --> 01:30:56,800
and let's start working on a project

01:30:54,880 --> 01:30:59,280
browser we may or may not be able to

01:30:56,800 --> 01:31:01,440
accomplish that in time for drupal 10

01:30:59,280 --> 01:31:03,199
but it could come shortly after drupal

01:31:01,440 --> 01:31:06,400
10 that's fine too

01:31:03,199 --> 01:31:09,360
and uh yeah let's migrate to gitlab

01:31:06,400 --> 01:31:09,840
so we can attract more contributors so

01:31:09,360 --> 01:31:11,280
let's

01:31:09,840 --> 01:31:13,199
make more people fall in love with

01:31:11,280 --> 01:31:14,960
drupal let's convert these people to

01:31:13,199 --> 01:31:18,239
long-term contributors

01:31:14,960 --> 01:31:20,719
and you know drupal will stay relevant

01:31:18,239 --> 01:31:22,320
and thriving for many many years to come

01:31:20,719 --> 01:31:24,000
so that's my dress note
