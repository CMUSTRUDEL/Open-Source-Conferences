12 15 eastern time which means as far as

00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:05,759
i know it's time to get started

00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,279
i put the title slide up so that

00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:07,759
everyone can make sure that they are in

00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:10,160
the same

00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:12,320
in the correct place this is a quick 30

00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,599
minute session on owning your own data

00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,519
we're going to talk about security

00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:18,800
flexibility and speed

00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:20,720
as part of that um i'm ken rickard i am

00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:24,320
the senior director of consulting

00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:27,039
at drupalfarmpallanteer.net um as you

00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,960
can see i went through to try to list

00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:30,560
or get some sense of how long i've been

00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,320
working with drupal

00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,239
this is just the list of drupal cons

00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,960
that i've attended

00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:40,399
and so you can get that sense i've been

00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:44,079
working with drupal since the 4.5 days

00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:45,600
and launched my first site 4.6 a little

00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:48,079
bit about palantir

00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,760
so we are a us-based company we were

00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:51,199
founded in 1996.

00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,360
our headquarters are in evanston

00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:54,640
illinois you get bonus points if you

00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,239
know that's where northwestern

00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,879
university is

00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:01,199
we're 35 person motif distributed across

00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:03,280
15 states in the district of columbia

00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:05,519
that's actually about make 16 states

00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,520
because one of our people is moving

00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,920
and we're a certified woman-owned small

00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,920
business

00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,920
what do we do we design and develop

00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,360
solutions using open source technologies

00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,360
and agile methodologies

00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,280
you can see on the screen some of our

00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,720
clients there are other clients that we

00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,479
cannot list

00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,080
and it's interesting for this talk

00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:26,159
because we specialize in working in

00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:29,920
higher education health care

00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,560
tech in the public sector data security

00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,960
and

00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,240
just data management is a huge issue for

00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,079
most of our clients

00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:38,079
one of the clients you'll see on this on

00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:39,680
this slide you might not recognize by

00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:41,200
name is etf

00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,119
that's the wisconsin department of

00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,240
employee trust funds they handle the

00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:46,320
pension plan for

00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:48,079
the entire state of wisconsin which is

00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,880
the ninth largest pension

00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:52,479
in the united states they touch one out

00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,960
of every three people in the entire

00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:55,520
state

00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:58,000
and so their data issues are pretty

00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,000
massive

00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:01,840
again just to give you a little bit

00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:05,040
about volunteer

00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:06,799
we do projects from all different angles

00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,560
if you need help with planning if you

00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:11,039
need help with implementation

00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,000
help coming up with what the strategy

00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:14,720
should be

00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,319
we handle that we also do ongoing

00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:20,000
strategy and support

00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:20,000
which is kind of a fascinating piece

00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,000
and again we can help you out with any

00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:26,319
of these four major

00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
elements of your project we do a lot of

00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:29,760
ongoing maintenance for folks

00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,040
and we do a lot of ongoing feature

00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:34,160
development with teams

00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,800
so it's pretty exciting and i'll also

00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,200
point out

00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,440
because i'm in charge of this we're

00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,800
hiring a web development engineer that

00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,959
positions

00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,319
applications are open until monday

00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:45,760
there's a link right there

00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:47,440
we can put it in the chat later where

00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,879
you can come by our expo booth we'll be

00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,480
happy to talk to you about it

00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:52,720
and for those of you who just went to

00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:55,200
the session on improving

00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,200
um

00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:59,440
reducing bias in your hiring process

00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,879
we're trying to do that as well and it's

00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,800
a really interesting thing so we're

00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:04,159
going to be having a webinar next week

00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,840
where we talk about the position and

00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:07,360
what it's like to work a pallet here so

00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,760
i encourage you to apply

00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,599
we're looking for people with php drupal

00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:15,440
and or javascript experience

00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:16,560
so please all right all that out of the

00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,159
way let's talk about

00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,480
owning your data and what that's going

00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:20,480
to mean

00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,080
really we're going to talk about a

00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:27,920
couple of different things today again

00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:29,120
the title is about security flexibility

00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,959
and speed

00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,480
and i want to start by putting some sort

00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:35,040
of bedrock

00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,959
baselines down which is what are we

00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,799
really talking about we're

00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,720
for the most part people like drupalcon

00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:41,599
are open source users and open source

00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,680
advocates

00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:45,599
but again it's important to make sure

00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,159
that we know what we're talking about

00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:50,080
so one of the primary things that we all

00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:53,519
care about is data freedom

00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:55,519
then that would go to a version of

00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,519
the rights of ownership and rights of

00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:59,599
usage

00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:01,040
that go with free software with open

00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:02,640
source software so

00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,720
i would say there are three fundamental

00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:07,360
rights around data

00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:09,439
again the right to create view edit

00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,680
archive and delete your data

00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:13,599
the right to modify your data structure

00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,480
and the right to move your data to a new

00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:16,959
system

00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,079
and different pieces of open source

00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:21,120
technology

00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:22,960
and proprietary technology handle these

00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,199
in different ways

00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:27,360
it's kind of interesting we do some work

00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,120
with salesforce the company

00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,120
they give you the right to modify your

00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,639
data structure that is a core feature of

00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,720
their proprietary product

00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,400
it's a very strong feature if you want

00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,759
to move your data out that's going to be

00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:41,040
a little bit more challenging

00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:42,639
but again i don't want to

00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,320
assume that because you're not open

00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:46,240
source you don't get

00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,600
granted these rights but they are things

00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,240
you need to be looking for

00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:52,880
in particular that that third one that

00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:56,240
right to move your data to a new system

00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:57,440
is fundamental to any modern web

00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,120
development project

00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:01,600
and we'll talk about why that is in a

00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,120
bit i also want to talk

00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,960
a little bit seriously about

00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,880
responsibilities of ownership

00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,560
they they love to say that open source

00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,400
software is free

00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,800
and there's lots of ways you might state

00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:15,199
that free is in

00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,039
cookies free is in whatever i'm i'm

00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:19,120
going with free is in puppies and we

00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:21,520
were talking about this in a

00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,600
company chat this morning if you've

00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,199
never had a puppy

00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,800
they're much more responsibility than

00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:29,039
you might think

00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,120
and so i do want to be serious here and

00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:33,080
say that the security accuracy and

00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,600
governance of your data is your direct

00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:37,680
responsibility

00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,680
and it's an ongoing thing and we'll talk

00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,440
about this when we talk about security

00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,360
and i will also point out that these

00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,199
liabilities and responsibilities are

00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,960
also true if you're hiring out storage

00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:50,960
of your data to a third party

00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:52,479
i'll get back to that in a second so

00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,479
here's a lighthearted slide that's

00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:56,160
talked about puppies what do i mean

00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:58,000
for those of you who are not dog owners

00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,800
this is mina she just walked into my

00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,919
office

00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,960
mina is 15 we adopted her after we found

00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:06,400
her as a stray

00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:09,039
15 years ago and in that time she has

00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:11,280
become part of the family she has also

00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:13,039
developed an enlarged heart

00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:15,039
so she's on special medication that she

00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:17,360
gets twice a day and she has recently

00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:19,199
developed cataracts so she's going blind

00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:22,000
in at least one eye

00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:23,840
so she's not real difficult she's only

00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,639
30 pounds

00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,440
but there is a lot going on in

00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:30,560
maintaining

00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:32,000
the quality of life for this dog so i

00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:35,600
think that's always true

00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:38,000
so when we talk about data rights we

00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,840
have to talk about data responsibilities

00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,800
and this is my reminder of that

00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:45,280
this is her lovely holiday photo and she

00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:47,360
has fun wearing amber's

00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,720
so we're going to start with the serious

00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,240
part with security

00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,639
so when we talk about data

00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:55,039
responsibility as i mentioned we do

00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:56,479
an awful lot of work with healthcare

00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:57,680
clients

00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:00,160
and one of the big things that

00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:03,599
healthcare clients need to do

00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:05,039
is connect patients to physicians

00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:07,440
the simple version of that is up in the

00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:10,000
right hand corner of the screenshot

00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,599
appointments appointment data are one of

00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,280
those things that seem very very

00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:16,400
innocuous

00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:17,120
but are in fact really critical to the

00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:21,199
functioning

00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:22,880
of data security because

00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:24,720
in the united states at least the

00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:28,160
regulations around what is considered

00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:31,759
personally protected medical information

00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:33,759
may include the information you need to

00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:36,000
to submit in order to make an

00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:39,120
appointment with a new physician

00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,400
right the fact that i have to disclose

00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,720
certain things about my medical

00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:45,039
condition even the type of doctor whose

00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:47,680
appointment i am recommending or i'm

00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:47,680
asking for

00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:53,520
reveals something about my health status

00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:55,280
that is protect protected and privileged

00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,400
information that we have to be very very

00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:00,479
careful with

00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:02,960
so uh what i want to say is

00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:04,080
you have to understand there's sort of

00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,400
three parts to

00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,840
security when we when we look at that

00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:10,080
and as i mentioned

00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:11,440
you're responsible for this stuff so you

00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:14,000
have to be aware

00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:15,919
that what are the data privacy issues

00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,560
involved with the data that you store

00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:19,199
the gdpr over in europe is a big deal

00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,599
here the

00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,960
the big ones for us in the united states

00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:25,120
have to do with

00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,240
student data they have to do with the

00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:29,599
data collected

00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:32,000
for people who are underage or minors

00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:33,599
and they have to do with health data

00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,080
those things

00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:37,760
your users have rights to how that data

00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:40,560
is stored and used and you are

00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:43,839
responsible for protecting those

00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:47,040
data security is the second response

00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:49,760
responsibility here breaches and hacks

00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:52,240
of your data are your liability

00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:54,080
that again includes if you've outsourced

00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,399
the hosting and things to other

00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,839
companies i did put an asterisk on this

00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:59,040
however because if you outsource to

00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:01,760
another company

00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:03,360
that's responsible for data that sorry

00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:06,399
hosts your website or hosts

00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:08,640
your web infrastructure they

00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:10,480
generally will have contractual language

00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,320
that

00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,320
provides guarantees against your

00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,680
liability but it's something you have to

00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,680
be very very aware of

00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,360
because you're still ultimately

00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,880
responsible

00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,320
and then the the third piece that i

00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,120
think a lot of people frequently

00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:27,440
overlook

00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:28,399
is data integrity and data integrity has

00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,880
to do

00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:32,320
i think very directly with that

00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,480
appointment question

00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,080
i want to make an appointment how much

00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,959
information am i asking

00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,440
for in order to make that appointment uh

00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:41,519
and

00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,560
here's where i would say the the key is

00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:45,680
you only should

00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:48,000
store the data that has to be stored

00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:49,600
and the converse to that or the

00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,480
follow-up that is you only change what

00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,519
data

00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:55,120
has to be changed and i'll give you

00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,399
another good example of the kind of

00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,440
thing that always makes me a little

00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:59,519
nervous

00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:02,079
lucky me i'm about to get my second

00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:04,560
pfizer vaccination on saturday

00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:05,200
but when i signed up for that uh the

00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,200
hospital

00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,720
asked for my social security number

00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,519
again for those of you not in the united

00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,160
states

00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:13,600
a social security number is a personally

00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:16,720
identifying

00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,519
nine ten digit nine digit number i can't

00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,360
even remember

00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:22,079
nine digit number that they assigned to

00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:26,000
you when you become a citizen

00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:28,640
and it's the core of all identity theft

00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
so any time someone asks me for my

00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:33,200
social security number

00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,880
i will say no unless i have no choice in

00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,200
the case of getting a vaccine which is

00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:40,079
really important i have to do that

00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:42,320
and so when we as software engineers or

00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:44,720
as project managers or as product

00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:47,680
managers when we talk to people

00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,800
about data security the one of your

00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:52,560
earliest problems

00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:55,040
is simply identifying what is required

00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,839
and if you need a unique identifier for

00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,360
people

00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:58,959
how can you do that in a way that

00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:02,240
doesn't compromise

00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:03,200
their data privacy and create bigger

00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,959
problems for

00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:10,160
for you down the road so

00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:12,240
that's the big thing about the sort of

00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:14,399
warnings about security

00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,000
and then i'll say security is really an

00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:17,839
ongoing strategy

00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,360
it's not something you do once and then

00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:22,320
forget uh

00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:24,720
there are multiple pieces to it there's

00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,560
your technical infrastructure

00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:29,440
there's different levels of compliance

00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:31,120
for hosting if you're running e-commerce

00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,200
there's all kinds of testing that has to

00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:35,279
be done to

00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,120
to do what they call again in the states

00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:39,519
pci compliant hosting

00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,440
there's fedramp compliant hosting for

00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:44,480
federal government work

00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:47,600
there's data encryption both

00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,839
during transit and at rest and so these

00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,079
are

00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:51,920
these are big issues about how you

00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:53,680
handle them again i'm not going to tell

00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,920
you how to solve them in this

00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:57,440
30 minutes but i'm going to highlight

00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:59,360
them as things that are very important

00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,920
for you to address

00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:04,720
there are software best practices one of

00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:07,279
the advantages that people overlook

00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:09,040
to having open source software is that

00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:10,560
ironically it's more secure than

00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:13,600
proprietary software

00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:17,120
because more people can look at the code

00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:21,279
and that includes bad actors and so it's

00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:23,680
actually easier to find insecure code

00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:25,680
there are coding tools and you'll you'll

00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,639
see reference to them throughout this

00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,040
drupal con

00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:30,079
that will help you audit your own code

00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:33,200
and look for

00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:35,839
insecure elements i just did a review of

00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:38,399
a site the other day for someone

00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:39,120
and they're handling medical practice

00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,720
stuff

00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,519
and they wrote some custom code that's

00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,480
not secure so it becomes really really

00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:46,480
important

00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,079
that you understand the secure code

00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,360
guidelines that go into say drupal

00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:50,320
development or anything that you're

00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,000
working with

00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,839
then it's a good question to ask of your

00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,399
vendors like what's their code security

00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:57,839
policy

00:12:54,399 --> 00:13:01,680
how does that work you also have to do

00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:04,560
periodic audits it's not enough to say

00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:07,600
well it's secure when we launched

00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:11,760
go back once a quarter go back however

00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:14,000
frequently you think is appropriate

00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:16,160
and that's going to depend again on the

00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:20,000
level of data that you're collecting

00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:21,680
and the seriousness of the breach

00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,200
and then the last piece which i think is

00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:26,320
really important is

00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:29,760
educating your team and understanding

00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:32,480
that the team who's working in your web

00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:34,399
on your website they come from marketing

00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,279
they come from editorial they come from

00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:37,839
technology

00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:40,160
teams they have different understandings

00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:42,560
and different responsibilities

00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:44,000
and they need to understand why certain

00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:46,720
decisions have to be made

00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,639
so when we have that question of hey

00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,399
should i store this social security

00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:53,199
number

00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:54,880
and i say please no let's not do that

00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:56,800
they need to know why that's important

00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,720
and that needs to be captured that

00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:01,279
decision needs to be captured

00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:03,600
and you need to be able to prevent

00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:06,079
backtracking on those kinds of decisions

00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,040
so making sure your team understands the

00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:09,360
implications

00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:11,839
of their data i think is really really

00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,839
crucial

00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,560
now we'll talk about fundpart talk about

00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,240
data agility so

00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,760
again we've got our sort of bedrocks

00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:22,560
down we understand

00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:24,560
i hope a little bit more about what goes

00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:26,079
into your data strategy

00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:28,320
we've talked about the security piece

00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:30,800
now let's talk about the fun parts

00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,880
it's a really obvious example again we

00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:35,600
have lots of medical clients

00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:36,160
covid came in it disrupted everything

00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:39,440
and

00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:42,240
all of our client not all

00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:43,440
90 of our clients had to do some form of

00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,360
pivot

00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:47,199
in terms of how they're presenting

00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,720
information what additional information

00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:52,399
they're presenting

00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:55,680
what kind of data they need and having

00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:56,399
open control active control of your data

00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,320
sources

00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:59,680
makes these kinds of pivots much much

00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:02,639
easier

00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:04,240
so one of the the great things about

00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:05,360
owning your data is they have both

00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:08,800
intended and

00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:10,959
accidental or unintended benefits

00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:13,279
if you're doing customer centric design

00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:13,600
where the purpose of your website is to

00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:17,440
help

00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:19,360
people accomplish tasks

00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:21,920
the only way you can do customer centric

00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,880
design is to be able to change your data

00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:26,399
presentation

00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:28,560
and your data model to map to what

00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:31,120
people are actually doing

00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,720
so that's a huge benefit that you might

00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:35,440
not be considering

00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,720
also note that preparing in advance for

00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,560
these kinds of changes

00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:40,240
give you a very very specific

00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:41,920
competitive advantage because you can

00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:44,240
pivot more quickly than others

00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:46,160
in your space and then i would also

00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:48,000
point out that flexible data structures

00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,759
are a risk mitigation strategy for those

00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,560
of you in the project management field

00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:54,320
i'm a big risk mitigation fan because i

00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:56,160
don't like it when things go badly

00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,519
and so i want to make sure that i can

00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:00,000
pivot when i need to

00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:01,360
and flexible data is a really good way

00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,839
to handle that

00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,480
i'll give you a non-medical example that

00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,240
is

00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,000
pretty key i'm not going to tell you

00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:10,480
which university this was

00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,759
however they do a lot of work with

00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,240
international students

00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:15,759
and as soon as covid hit their

00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,199
international students could no longer

00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:19,279
come to the united states

00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:20,399
so they had to move all of their courses

00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:24,320
online

00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:27,120
now that is a huge undertaking

00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,839
their website presents all the course

00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,680
options

00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:32,000
and the formats and things like that and

00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:35,120
it just so happened

00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,720
that six months prior we had finished an

00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:39,839
engagement with them

00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:41,279
to optimize their data flexibility and

00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:42,160
i'll show you some more examples about

00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:44,079
that later

00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,360
so they were able to make a very very

00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:48,160
fast pivot

00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:49,519
when their business situation changed

00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:54,079
and i think this is the sort of

00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:56,959
key point to any form of open data

00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:58,880
storage right being able to do what you

00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:00,480
need to with what you have

00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:02,800
so we're going to talk about that some

00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:05,039
in the next bit

00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:06,480
the last piece that i want to say and i

00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:07,919
i hinted at this when we were talking

00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:10,799
about security

00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:11,439
is that data governance is a big deal

00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:15,839
right

00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:19,199
um data is just an aggregate

00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:22,160
of information about people and data is

00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:23,919
managed by the people on your team right

00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,839
so some of the problems that you'll run

00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:26,880
into is if you have data in multiple

00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:30,080
places

00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,799
and that university website i just

00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,880
showed you

00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:35,280
has that problem because their data is

00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:37,760
stored in a course management system

00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:39,440
and then pulled into drupal so now

00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,799
they've got duplicates

00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:43,039
and they have the possibility of what

00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:44,960
happens if our data gets out of sync

00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:47,280
what happens if data from one system

00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:50,640
doesn't get to the other system

00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:52,480
right so that's an interesting problem

00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,240
but you can also have multiple owners

00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,960
and stakeholders regarding your data

00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,320
and it could be hard to make decisions

00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,200
especially if you don't have the proper

00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,120
perspective

00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:03,360
without giving away too much i'm working

00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:04,559
on something right now

00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,640
where i'm having to have pretty

00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:09,440
difficult conversations with a client

00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:11,200
whose data model does not support their

00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,720
design

00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,400
this is something you always want to get

00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:16,880
out in front of earlier

00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,480
and so the question now becomes do we

00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:21,360
alter the design

00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:23,360
or do we invest in making pretty

00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:25,280
substantial changes to the data model

00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:28,240
and again i'll get into that when we

00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:32,160
talk about speed the

00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:34,880
the key to all of this to governance is

00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:36,720
agility in your team again having

00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,960
technical agility is not good enough you

00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,799
have to be able to have these

00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,640
conversations in order to push things

00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:44,240
forward so i said i've been doing this

00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:46,880
for a long time so

00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,760
i didn't do this project in 1972 i did

00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:51,360
this project

00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:53,039
in probably 2012.

00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:54,480
i think this might have been a drupal 6

00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:57,360
project or

00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:59,360
one of our first drupal 7s um was

00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,960
working with a state public radio system

00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:03,360
they wanted to take their entire

00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:06,480
playlist from 1972

00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:09,280
and put it online and make it searchable

00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:10,000
and their internal team had three key

00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:13,200
stakeholders

00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,840
their their archivist their dba who was

00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,640
a

00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:18,400
an oracle dba a database administrator

00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,919
um and their designer

00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:22,240
those three people had been working

00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:24,559
there for at least 30 years total

00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:26,000
and had never ever had a conversation

00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:28,400
before

00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,039
and the challenge of course is in order

00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,480
to

00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:33,600
complete the critical part to their

00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,880
project

00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:37,679
those three people have to be in

00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:39,919
alignment because we can't

00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:41,919
do what they're trying to do if those

00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:44,160
three don't have a shared understanding

00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:46,559
of how the data works and how it's going

00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:53,440
to be used

00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:55,919
so excuse me

00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:57,600
i am checking time i have nine minutes

00:19:55,919 --> 00:20:00,640
so i think we're right on schedule

00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:04,000
we're gonna talk some about performance

00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:05,280
and i think this reflects some of the

00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,400
things we've been talking about

00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:09,679
so far there are two kinds of speed that

00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,760
i think we want to talk about

00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:13,120
there's web performance there's site

00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:15,120
performance and there's

00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:16,240
governance performance there's decision

00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:18,000
making performance

00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,600
so there's the question of can you

00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,880
access the data that you need

00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:24,159
in a reliable and efficient way can you

00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,960
agree to data model

00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:28,559
model modifications in a reliable and

00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,919
efficient way

00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:32,240
and then there are two other good

00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:34,320
questions that i would put there

00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:35,280
both performance issues and governance

00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:37,039
issues which is

00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,480
do you know where your canonical data

00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:42,480
store lies

00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:44,080
like which version is the truth

00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,919
and then how do you reconcile

00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:49,440
derivatives of that

00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:51,360
truth so that's a huge question again

00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:53,120
we could spend another 20 minutes on but

00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:55,200
i'm not going to today

00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:56,640
but let's go back to our our higher

00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:59,520
education example

00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,559
the challenge to building a page like

00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,880
this

00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:04,960
from their course management system is

00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:06,240
that the data is stored in multiple

00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:09,360
different locations

00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:10,159
and i believe as you look like this was

00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:13,840
there

00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:16,480
during the search view and this is their

00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:17,919
viewing the page view and there's a lot

00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:21,039
of information here

00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:22,559
and the challenge is um and when you do

00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:24,799
this type of work you get used to using

00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:27,600
a lot of spreadsheets

00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:30,080
this is our map of where all that data

00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:33,840
comes from in their third-party system

00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:37,360
now their third-party system couldn't

00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:39,039
excuse it could provide an api to let

00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:42,880
them build that page

00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:44,400
the problem was if you wanted to build

00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,039
the page with all the data that they

00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,200
wanted

00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:49,440
they had to make eight or nine separate

00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:52,320
api calls

00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,880
and every api calling is expensive so

00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:56,000
the big

00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:59,520
project that we had was to figure out

00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:02,320
how all of these things work

00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:03,280
how they're stored and how we can reprop

00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,360
reprocess

00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,559
them so that we can produce this page

00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:10,480
efficiently

00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:14,080
in their current site this makes one

00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:16,960
api call directly to drupal that

00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:18,960
delivers exactly the data that they want

00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,880
because we consolidated all of these

00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:23,919
things

00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:26,480
right so when we talk about

00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:28,400
your application and speed we're talking

00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:30,400
about streamlining the data model

00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,760
how do you consolidate the requests that

00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:35,360
you're making

00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:37,039
um how do you cache that right

00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,640
there are three fundamental ways that

00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:40,320
you might do that

00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:42,000
if you're using drupal which most of us

00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:44,400
are the drupal database

00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,720
is a very efficient caching mechanism

00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:49,760
for external data and api data

00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:51,280
you can also push things to file it can

00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:54,720
be very very efficient

00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:57,919
to take your data and put it to um

00:22:54,720 --> 00:23:01,039
excuse me to put it to

00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:03,200
flat 5 that's perfectly appropriate and

00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:06,240
you may be working with vendors who have

00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:07,679
strong apis and strong caching

00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,600
when you do that however the question

00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:09,840
becomes well how do i reset that cache

00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:13,120
and

00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:14,480
make sure that i have the freshest data

00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:16,159
and that's one of the challenges that

00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:19,440
you'll run into when

00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:20,480
on this website they have to refresh the

00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:24,400
course data

00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:26,159
every hour because they

00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:28,400
i didn't show you but you can sign up

00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:30,320
for courses online so they have to know

00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:32,720
if there's an open seat in that course

00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:34,640
and that open seat data is stored

00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:36,960
in the course management system not in

00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:39,919
drupal and i'll point out

00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:40,640
the flap to wrap back to the security

00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:42,320
piece

00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:45,120
it's not stored in drupal because it's

00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:46,880
an e-commerce transaction

00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:48,080
that we don't want to touch because we

00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,520
don't want to have to deal with the

00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:52,559
security concerns

00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:53,840
of storing credit card data right

00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:56,080
so they already have an existing

00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:56,880
third-party payment processing

00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,559
application

00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:01,039
that directly integrates to the course

00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:03,360
management system there's no reason for

00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:06,000
us to reproduce that

00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,799
but it does create a bit of a race

00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,559
condition

00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:13,200
where if somebody purchases a course

00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:14,720
we now have one less available seat and

00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,080
we have to make sure we get that update

00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,799
as quickly as we can

00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:21,520
so you can see this gets really

00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:23,840
complicated really really quickly

00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:24,880
but i will also point out that there is

00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:28,720
a governance

00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:32,159
aspect to speed the data model does

00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:33,440
solve some of these problems but

00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:35,600
when you have data that lives in

00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:37,480
multiple places as i said before

00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,960
you can get duplicates you can get

00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:41,039
inconsistencies

00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:42,559
frequently especially with university

00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:45,360
clients when they're pulling

00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:46,000
course data over into drupal they want

00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,000
to enhance

00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,440
that in some way so you have a

00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,840
derivative

00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,799
of the canonical data sitting in drupal

00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:55,760
and the question becomes

00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:57,840
you know do you push that back to the to

00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:59,360
the data store or not

00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,559
um so how do you deal with those

00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,840
duplicates how do you deal with

00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:04,640
inconsistencies

00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:05,200
but it can also be a huge challenge just

00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:08,159
to make

00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:09,039
data model changes because multiple

00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:11,840
owners as i

00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:13,360
point out with the radio example

00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,080
multiple owners and stakeholders may

00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:16,000
have multiple

00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:17,919
views and sometimes it can be

00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,679
complicated because you'll want to make

00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:21,840
a data model change

00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:23,919
and it'll make life really difficult for

00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:26,799
your editors

00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:29,440
or your editors won't understand why

00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:31,919
that data model change is necessary

00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:33,919
and people hate workflow changes and so

00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:37,360
it can be very very difficult

00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:39,039
and as i said in another project

00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:40,880
the data model may dictate that

00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:41,679
something in the design simply can't be

00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:44,080
done

00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:45,600
and so when and how do you make those

00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:48,080
compromises as a team

00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:49,279
becomes really really important and as i

00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:52,559
said you do a lot of this

00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:53,279
in spreadsheets this is actually a

00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:55,600
spreadsheet

00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:57,840
from an online conference we did last

00:25:55,600 --> 00:26:01,039
week last year excuse me last week

00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:04,480
that we did last year this is literally

00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:06,000
just our data model negotiation document

00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,520
where the technical team and the

00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,320
editorial team

00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:11,679
try to talk to each other and capture

00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:13,600
decisions and

00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:14,799
the reason i point this out is not so

00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:17,520
that you can read it

00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:19,279
but the things in green red and yellow

00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:22,480
on the left hand side

00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:25,039
are new additions and

00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:25,919
that those colors indicate the state of

00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:29,600
those additions

00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:30,400
as in green yes it's fine yellow we have

00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,880
questions

00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:34,559
read we haven't done that yet do we need

00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,960
to do it we need we should talk about

00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:38,000
this

00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:39,440
so this is a very very classic piece and

00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,400
again as part of your governance you

00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:43,840
need to capture

00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:46,559
all of these decisions so

00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:48,400
with a stunning two minutes left i'll

00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:50,400
give you some best practices

00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:53,679
so when you're owning your data remember

00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:55,200
it's an ongoing process

00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:57,200
you want to be able to identify your

00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:59,200
data sources you want to know what's

00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:00,159
canonical storage and what's derivative

00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,080
storage

00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:03,919
you want to know what your security

00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:05,120
paradigm for that is

00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:06,720
you want to know what your data

00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:09,600
structure is and you want to know what

00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:11,919
apis you have access to

00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:12,960
you do and this is where a lot of places

00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:14,960
i think have

00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:16,559
challenges you want to assign data

00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:18,799
ownership someone at your

00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:20,480
organization needs to be responsible for

00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:23,120
each data source

00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:26,000
and trust me one of our project managers

00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:28,320
is doing a session on friday about this

00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:31,520
just having one data owner is not enough

00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:33,120
you need a backup plan for contingencies

00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:34,799
i'm working on a project right now where

00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:38,320
the principal is about

00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:39,200
to go away on maternity leave i'm doing

00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:41,120
contingency

00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,880
work at our own company because one of

00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,679
our other employees is on paternity

00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:46,240
leave

00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:47,760
right so i had to pick up everything

00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:49,919
that they own actually i'm covering for

00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:53,039
another person who's on sabbatical

00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:56,240
so you have to be able to

00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:59,200
pass along responsibilities you also do

00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:02,320
need to schedule audits and reviews

00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:05,440
and that that is a great place to

00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:07,760
bring in third parties to do that um and

00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:10,399
using your data i would say is also

00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:12,480
an ongoing process so you want to know

00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:14,480
how you're using it you want to know

00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:16,320
what the canonical and derivative uses

00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:17,760
are this is especially true for people

00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:20,399
who publish once

00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:22,080
and use in multiple places you need to

00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:24,720
document the time sensitivity

00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:26,960
sensitivity for updates

00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,919
excuse me you need to document the data

00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:31,679
flows

00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:34,240
between systems and then

00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:34,240
pardon me

00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:38,000
it's georgia it's allergy season down

00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,840
here

00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,520
you need to assign editorial ownership

00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:43,200
as well because it's not

00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:44,880
quite good enough that the technical

00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:48,320
people understand

00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:50,480
it's important that editorial team

00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:52,799
knows how to identify problems and how

00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:55,840
to communicate problems in an effective

00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:58,159
manner so thank you

00:28:55,840 --> 00:29:00,240
we finished i think just on time i don't

00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:03,760
believe we have official time for q

00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:05,840
a however palantir.net does have a booth

00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:07,760
over in the expo hall and i'm going to

00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:10,320
jump over there here in a minute and

00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:13,200
we'll be around all week

00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:15,039
i'm going to stop excuse me stop screen

00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:16,960
sharing for now

00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:27,120
and see if there are any questions that

00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:41,840
we do have time to answer

00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:41,840
and hopefully i didn't talk too fast

00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:56,159
and then i will drop in

00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:56,159
a link to the session i just mentioned

00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:03,520
that is the session that megan davis

00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:06,799
who's one of our

00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:07,600
product managers is doing quite

00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:09,440
literally

00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:10,720
just before the covid restrictions hit

00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:12,320
the united states

00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:14,000
we kicked off a project with a

00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:16,880
university client

00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:19,039
it was actually the last last airplane

00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:22,240
flight i took

00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:24,000
and almost immediately that team had to

00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:27,279
start planning for what happens

00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,799
if someone gets sick and so

00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:30,799
it's a really nice tie into what we were

00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:32,159
talking about here today again i want to

00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:33,760
thank everybody for coming i'm going to

00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:35,679
shut this down and i'm going to hop over

00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:43,840
to our expo booth

00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:43,840
