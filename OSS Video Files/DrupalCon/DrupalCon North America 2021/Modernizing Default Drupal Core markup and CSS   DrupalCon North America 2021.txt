hello welcome to my session

00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,400
on modernizing triple core default

00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,920
markup uh

00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,000
i'm going to continue on the topic of

00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:14,160
starter kit team which we

00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,679
covered on the keynote earlier today so

00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,240
uh

00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:19,680
let's get started so i'm laura escola on

00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,160
drupal.org you can find me with the

00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:25,279
nickname laurie with three eyes

00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:28,800
i'm a staff software engineer at akuya

00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:29,519
and i'm based in helsinki i'm also a

00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,519
drupal front

00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:34,160
framework manager and a team system

00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:34,160
maintainer

00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,120
so classy is the core team that ships

00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,239
default markup and css with some

00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,600
sensible defaults

00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:44,399
in comparison to the stable team which

00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:46,320
does contain minimal markup and css

00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,079
however if you look at classy today and

00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,520
compare it to classy that's it with the

00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:52,559
initial release of triple eight

00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:54,399
it would be almost identical the reason

00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:56,160
for that is that we have to be careful

00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:57,680
when making changes to classy

00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,440
because all changes to class equals the

00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:01,120
risk of breaking existing teams that are

00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,640
extending classy

00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:05,360
practically speaking classy markup and

00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,880
css are frozen at the moment

00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,119
so what does it mean that our default

00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,799
markup and css are frozen

00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:13,439
it means that we cannot change markup

00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:19,600
including classes element types

00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:19,600
and css basically any kind of css rules

00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,840
when they get changed that could cause

00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:27,280
disruption to teams that are extending

00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,040
all of these things are critical to

00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,799
solving bugs especially when it comes to

00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,400
accessibility

00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,920
and this is let into a situation where

00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,840
we are shipping known boxes part of

00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,600
classy that we are unable to fix because

00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,360
fixing them would require changing

00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,520
markup or css which we

00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,240
consider frozen because of the bc

00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,079
promise that we are making

00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:48,079
we're also unable to do any refactoring

00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:50,560
of markup or css is most of it would be

00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:52,560
considered disruptive

00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,000
so how did we get here let's take a look

00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,399
at some of the decisions that created

00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,840
the

00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:59,360
current situation i'd like to mention

00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,119
that i'm not trying to point out this

00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:04,399
event to blame on anyone or

00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:06,840
any particular decision my sole purpose

00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:09,360
is to provide context to what has

00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:11,440
happened

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,959
so in drupalcon austin an array of

00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,640
decisions started

00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:17,440
that has taken us to where we are at the

00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,560
moment a group of front-end contributors

00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,160
run a survey

00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,319
they try to better understand how core

00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,920
could better serve front-end developers

00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:25,520
one of the findings was that there was a

00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:28,160
good number of people who expected the

00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:30,400
default market to be less opinionated

00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:32,640
they felt the triple core default market

00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:36,800
was bloated

00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:40,160
so that included ids classes and

00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:42,400
lots of nested html elements

00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:45,200
another finding was that frontend

00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,640
developers didn't want to write php

00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,720
it was now possible to write teams

00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,400
without php because of

00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,160
drupal 8 just added trick templating

00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,920
engine however

00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,840
at the time a big chunk of the markup

00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:58,879
was still generated in render arrays and

00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,640
pre-process functions

00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:02,080
to solve these problems the group of

00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,519
developers passionate about front and

00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,040
met at drupalcon austin

00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:07,840
they came up with a solution that would

00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:09,440
include creating a new team classy

00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,120
the plan was to remove as many css

00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,879
classes and file from module preposter

00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:18,640
functions and templates as possible

00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:20,319
and move them to class c

00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,800
in the last year of drupal 8 development

00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:25,120
we made a lot of good progress

00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,879
however not all of the work was done by

00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,720
the release of triple 8.

00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:30,400
this is partly due to the large scope

00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,920
and due to all of the key contributors

00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,000
shifting focus to triple-a release

00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:36,000
blocking issues

00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,840
after all at that time it was most

00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,319
important for us to ship triple aid on

00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:42,400
time

00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:44,480
rather than fix uh markup issues

00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,080
the release process at the time was that

00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,879
we could we would not have been allowed

00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,920
to make any changes to core markup until

00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:51,440
the major

00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,360
development branch was open so

00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:55,439
essentially when triple nine branch was

00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:58,560
open we would be allowed to start making

00:03:55,439 --> 00:04:00,159
markup changes again so in drupalcon

00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,519
barcelona which was few months before

00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:03,680
the release we discussed how we would

00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:05,920
handle the leftover issues

00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,280
we expected we expected at the time the

00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:10,080
triple-a release cycle would be

00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,560
likely a long one um it took quite a

00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,280
long

00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,239
to build triple eight so we expected

00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,680
that

00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:17,759
it will likely take quite a long to ship

00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,919
triple 9 as well

00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:21,519
and for that reason we wanted to come up

00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:23,040
with a solution that would allow us to

00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:24,479
continue working on improving default

00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,800
markup and css

00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:28,479
so this is how stable was born it was

00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,120
added as another layer between modules

00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:31,520
and

00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,360
classic to allow us to continue with

00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,199
removing classes from core

00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,199
so this is essentially how the teams

00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:39,040
looked like when triple 8 shipped

00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:40,320
this is more or less true for drupal 9

00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:43,040
as well we have now

00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:44,160
wanted a couple of additional teams on

00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,240
top of this

00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,840
uh what you can see here is the light

00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,960
blue themes

00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:53,840
are the ones that are internal

00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,560
um they can be changed so seven bardic

00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,440
stark

00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:59,040
uh is basically just core module markup

00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,560
those can be changed and then we have

00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,479
classy and stable which are

00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,680
frozen they are the ones where we

00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:06,080
provide bc

00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,360
for people that are extending those

00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,960
teams

00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,840
they are they are part of our api

00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:13,680
promise

00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,840
so the decision that finally held at all

00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,080
markup changes in classy was a decision

00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,840
to implement continuous upgrade paths

00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:22,840
that means all these day changes need to

00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:25,520
be made by deprecating the old behavior

00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:28,320
first this is great for site authors

00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:30,240
because upgrading sites is much easier

00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,520
this is great for teams that are

00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,960
extending classy as well

00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:36,400
because they their team would continue

00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,479
to just work they wouldn't have to do

00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:41,520
any uh any work

00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:44,000
to upgrade to the next major release

00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,639
however it creates a challenge for how

00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,080
to

00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:50,240
maintain markup and css because

00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:53,840
we cannot make changes there between the

00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,840
major releases like we've done before

00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,160
so deprecating code doesn't make sense

00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,680
in markup or css

00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,479
and the only option we were left with

00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:05,360
was to deprecate wall teams at once

00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:06,800
or does any of the people in the

00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:10,160
audience have ideas how we could

00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:13,039
deprecate for example a css rule

00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,080
i assume that we don't have ideas on how

00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,440
to do that because it's not a

00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,919
programming language it's really

00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,919
challenging

00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,639
so for this reason we have stable and

00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:24,479
stable nine teams at the moment

00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:25,680
there's no upgrade path from stable to

00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:27,840
stable nine

00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,800
we're not also expecting users to

00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,720
upgrade from a stable

00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,160
stable line which would be sort of the

00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,319
same experience user

00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,000
are getting if we are introducing

00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:38,800
arbitrary markup and css changes in

00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,800
major releases

00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,400
so in 2019 as we started preparing for

00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:46,319
drupal 9 we finally wanted to start

00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,520
working on improving that situation

00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:49,680
we discussed this in the triple

00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,639
conceivable 2019 sprints and came up

00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,240
with a multi-step

00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:54,880
plan which ended up spanning across the

00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,240
drupal 910 releases

00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,759
there are still many steps left to

00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,560
complete but so far we have made good

00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:00,160
progress

00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:03,599
one of the major milestones in the plan

00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:05,039
was a new starter kit team

00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:07,440
the new starter kit theme will change

00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:09,120
how drupal core ships its default markup

00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,400
instead of shipping our default markup

00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,919
in the base team that front-end

00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,199
developers inherit

00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:15,520
they create a starting point for

00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:17,360
front-end developers to fork

00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:19,919
this approach is similar to some country

00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:23,520
projects like basic and zen

00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:26,080
they provide a cli tool which then

00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:28,800
generates a a team from sort of starting

00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:30,080
point that they provide

00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,840
i want to emphasize that we are not

00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,599
planning to get rid of base teams or

00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:36,160
the inheritance we are simply changing

00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:39,120
how a markup is shipped in core

00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,800
um there will continue to exist valid

00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,240
use cases for base teams for example an

00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,080
organization like university that has

00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,639
multiple teams could benefit from having

00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,639
a base team

00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,400
their use case is quite different from

00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:52,400
us because they have visibility

00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,599
to the teams that are extending the base

00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:57,120
team so they can sort of

00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:58,879
assess uh what is the impact of any

00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,560
particular change

00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:02,240
they could even test for regressions

00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,720
automatically

00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,520
when they when they introduced them

00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:09,199
because they could have

00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:10,000
integration testing what as drupal core

00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:13,680
we don't have

00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:16,400
any visibility to how

00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,199
folks are extending classy which is

00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:20,319
unfortunate so

00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:22,160
uh any any any change to a

00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:23,520
markup or css could be considered

00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:26,879
disruptive to some team

00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:29,680
because of um that's just the way sort

00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:33,200
of markup and css is

00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:34,880
so i have a brief video to uh show you

00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,479
how the

00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,839
starter kit team works the new starter

00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,240
kit theme proposed to be added to drupal

00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:42,240
core

00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,480
i'm going to start by pulling these

00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:48,959
changes to my local environment

00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:50,720
uh we can see a merge request over here

00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:52,240
so this is essentially what i need to

00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:55,839
take locally i've

00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:58,000
already done that so

00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:00,399
as you can see i have that branch on my

00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,880
local environment so we are good to go

00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:04,800
with that what i'm going to do next is

00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,680
check the api changes from the issue

00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,880
summary

00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:13,360
i'm going to copy this command which

00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:15,839
will uh print all of the uh

00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,200
different configuration options that

00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:20,240
this command has

00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,120
as you can see uh the the command that

00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,399
we just run

00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:27,200
is uh for a uh

00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:29,040
php file in uh core scripts drupal so

00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,320
that's a symphony console app which we

00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:33,200
already have in core

00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,000
and uh then as part of this issue we

00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,519
just added

00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:40,320
a new command to generate a team

00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:41,600
over here you can see that uh we require

00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,680
one argument for

00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,600
a machine name this is the machine name

00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,839
of the

00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,440
the new newly generated team that you

00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:51,760
want wanted to have

00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:54,080
then we also provide options for name

00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:57,760
and description and the pad

00:09:54,080 --> 00:10:00,480
and uh essentially this allows you to

00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:02,240
create a human readable name for the uh

00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,279
team that gets generated you can you can

00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,720
set a description

00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:06,880
for the for the team and you can also

00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:10,320
define where it

00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:13,519
gets generated so i am going to

00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:15,600
copy these uh

00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:16,640
from the example that we have i'm going

00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,320
to remove the path

00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:20,399
teams because that's unnecessary because

00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:23,279
that's already the default value

00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:25,279
where the team gets generated and i'm

00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:27,920
going to run that command

00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:29,040
we can see that it generated a new team

00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,040
successfully

00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:33,839
and now we're going to take a look what

00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,839
is inside there

00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,399
so as you can probably see it's pretty

00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:40,399
much just a just a normal team so we

00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:41,279
have an info file we have a team file we

00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:44,640
have file for

00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:45,760
libraries and uh i'm going to open the

00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:48,000
info yaml file

00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:50,640
first and you can see that the team name

00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:54,320
that we specified as part of the

00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:55,839
command is now here and uh the team is

00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,880
extending stable nine

00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:00,320
that's uh what the team is currently

00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,079
doing if you generate team it's

00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,800
extending stable 9 and that's what we

00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:06,160
sort of

00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:08,560
recommend there you can see also the

00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,839
description and some are other

00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:12,240
other things that are a little bit more

00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:13,200
static so the libraries and libraries

00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,800
extend but

00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,800
these are also generated so that the

00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:21,680
libraries that are related to uh or

00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,480
loaded from this team

00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,519
we replace the machine name correctly so

00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,240
that

00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:29,040
they are loaded from here so for example

00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,920
the

00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:34,640
base library you can see that's defined

00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,640
over here

00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:43,920
so as i mentioned earlier

00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:46,720
this theme is is generated from classy

00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:51,519
however it's not generated from classy

00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:54,959
uh directly uh we've created sort of a

00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:57,920
new new team which we use

00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:59,120
as the starting point or the source for

00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,720
the teams that are

00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,240
being generated it's called starter kit

00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,880
team uh

00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:06,079
it's it's a regular team you can see it

00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,200
has all of the things

00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:09,440
pretty much all of the things that you

00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:11,040
saw in the generated team as well

00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,720
so for example the base theme here is

00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:15,360
also stable nine uh

00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,399
we just mark it as hidden uh and that's

00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,279
something we don't do

00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:22,399
we did we just removed that from the

00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:25,360
team that we generated

00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:26,320
um all of the templates css at the

00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:30,240
moment

00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:31,519
they've been just copied from classy

00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,360
except that we've made some minor

00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:35,279
changes to some documentation just to

00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:38,320
remove references to classy

00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:41,600
and uh make it more suitable for the

00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:43,600
generated themes so next

00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,040
what i'm going to do is i'm going to

00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:48,639
refresh

00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,639
appearance page on my

00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:53,519
drupal installation on my local we can

00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:56,160
see a new custom theme

00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:56,639
over here the description is is what we

00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:00,560
set

00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:03,920
on the cli command and

00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,920
i'm going to install this

00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:10,079
and uh i'm going to

00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,920
set to my preferred team so this tool

00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:14,639
just to sort of switch over

00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:16,320
different themes quickly and uh right

00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:19,279
right here we have a

00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,000
drupal using a team generator using the

00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:22,560
starter kit team

00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,560
generator

00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:29,600
and the new starter kit is supposed to

00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:33,040
be added to drupal core

00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:35,200
okay um so as you can see that is

00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:36,560
pretty functional already so it already

00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,720
generates a team

00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:40,560
based on the markup that we got from

00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,240
classy we do still have some open

00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,959
questions on our problems we have to

00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,399
solve

00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:46,000
for example we need to decide what kind

00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:46,880
of customization options we should

00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,480
provide

00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:50,320
for example should we provide an option

00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,160
to include post css in the generated

00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,440
team that's what we use with claro and

00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,680
olivero

00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,800
um then there's also a question should

00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,880
we provide an option to include

00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:01,040
javascript tooling in the generated team

00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,079
we also got some proposals that we

00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,399
should add some

00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:05,120
default javascript in there and if you

00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:06,880
did that

00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,399
at the moment since drupal core is using

00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,160
uh babel

00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:11,839
to compile our javascript it might make

00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:15,120
sense to also provide some tooling

00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:16,079
to be able to sort of get more benefit

00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:19,920
out of those javascript

00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:21,600
files uh we also need to decide on

00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,440
whether we provide some

00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,040
capabilities to pull in changes that

00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,000
have happened in the starter hit teams

00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,399
to the

00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,320
generate teams or staying up to date due

00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:33,120
to the starter kit team

00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:34,480
uh we don't necessarily have a decision

00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,079
on that yet whether it's something we

00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:39,600
are going to put a lot of effort into

00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:43,600
so your feedback would be appreciated

00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:45,680
on that uh so next steps that we have

00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,120
are that we want to allow starter kit

00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:50,639
themes to define

00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:52,880
how the team should be generated so

00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:54,720
the demo that i just did was based on

00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:56,079
sort of a static set of rules that we

00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,959
have defined in the

00:14:56,079 --> 00:15:00,160
theme generator uh but we want to extend

00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:03,040
that so that there's an

00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:04,639
uh api for teams to use so that they can

00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,880
provide their own steps

00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:08,399
uh for example the steps that we provide

00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:11,440
at the moment don't support

00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:12,880
uh configuration of uh items in the

00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,639
config folder

00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:16,639
so if your team needed something like

00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:19,680
that you could add it

00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:23,680
using the api i

00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:26,320
will also need uh some some more work

00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:27,760
to be able to allow deciding which team

00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,040
to use as a starter kit team so that

00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,920
would essentially mean that you could

00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,880
use

00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:33,759
uh some contrib teams or maybe olivero

00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,920
or something else

00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:37,360
as the starter kit theme so right now we

00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:39,440
only have this one starting point

00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,480
but in future the cli command could

00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:43,920
allow other teams

00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:45,360
to be used as well and

00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:47,920
the one of the hard problems that i

00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:51,519
mentioned on the previous slide is also

00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:54,000
a a a beta blocker for deaths

00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:55,279
so something that we need to solve at

00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,160
least on some level

00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:59,759
before we can get it in core is to make

00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:01,519
updating exchanges from starter kit

00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:03,519
teams to generate teams easier

00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:04,639
and as part of that we need to decide

00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:07,440
sort of how much

00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:08,320
fr do we want to put on that like how

00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,959
much do

00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:13,759
user users expect to update their

00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:16,720
starter kit themes

00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:16,720
generated teams

00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:22,160
so we are going to uh

00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,480
do some contributions around this later

00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:27,199
today uh join us today

00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,000
and help us test out the new starter kit

00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:30,240
theme

00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,720
uh triage issues to improve the default

00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,920
markup and css so we have lots of issues

00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,959
that are

00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:38,800
um sort of now uh

00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:40,079
part of the classic component we're

00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,920
planning to retrieve

00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:43,440
those and see if some of them are

00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,320
relevant to the starter kit theme so

00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:48,480
that we could

00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:48,480
sort of easily solve them over there

00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:53,440
and um i have a few minutes left i

00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:54,240
believe so uh if there are any questions

00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:57,680
i

00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,680
can take a look at the uh

00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:06,640
q a or or chat

00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:09,199
so there's one question from norman why

00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:12,799
is the new team not created in the team

00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:14,160
custom folder but just in teams um

00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:16,319
actually that's a good question i don't

00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:18,000
think we really considered the option to

00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:21,039
generate it in teams custom i think

00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,120
that's uh good feedback uh

00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:24,959
we could but then potentially do

00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:27,520
something like that

00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:28,400
um if if that's something that folks

00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:31,600
find useful

00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:34,559
however the the folder is is

00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:36,400
configurable so if uh you need that you

00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:39,600
could already do that by just

00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:40,799
uh changing the directory and on the

00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,200
command in the team

00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:43,200
custom

00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:47,440
the next question i have is could you

00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,799
talk about the differences between

00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:52,320
stable and stable nine

00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:56,480
so stable is basically the module markup

00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:59,440
that we have taken from uh triple eight

00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:00,559
point zero point zero release and uh

00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:03,760
stable nine

00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:06,080
is drupal 9.0.0 release

00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:08,240
so it's more or less the same but it has

00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:10,799
all of the busy layers removed and

00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:12,320
a couple of uh and some markup and css

00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:15,840
changes that has happened

00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:15,840
between drupal 8 and drupal 9.

00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:29,840
do we have any other questions

00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:38,880
i think we are probably pretty close to

00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,760
um out of time as well so thank you

00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,120
everyone

00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:43,200
if you have any questions feel free to

00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:51,520
join the sprints later

00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:51,520
