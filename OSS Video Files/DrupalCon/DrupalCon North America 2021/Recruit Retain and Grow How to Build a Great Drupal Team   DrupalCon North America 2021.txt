okay

00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:06,799
let's uh let's go ahead and get started

00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:10,240
um welcome to

00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:11,120
my quick presentation on how to recruit

00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,559
retain

00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:17,440
and grow a great drupal team

00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:17,680
my name is scott weston he him his and i

00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,279
am

00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,920
the senior director of drupal

00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:23,680
engineering at bounias

00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,359
so what we're going to run through today

00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:28,080
is a little bit of

00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:29,119
the the reasoning and the why behind

00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,039
building a

00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:32,800
your own drupal team uh going to look at

00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:34,079
some considerations and challenges

00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,399
that that come along with that

00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,160
particularly when it comes to staffing

00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:39,840
and hopefully offer some solutions for

00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,640
you and then

00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,600
uh look at some some tips and tricks on

00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:47,039
finding or

00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:50,239
building your own drupal talent

00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:52,800
so you need a strong team to create

00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:54,480
a great digital experience with drupal

00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,320
so the question is

00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,600
do you have the right people today for

00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,320
that team

00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,039
a great drupal team is made up solely is

00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,800
not made up

00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:05,119
solely of drupal developers let me say

00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:07,119
that again a great drupal team

00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:08,400
is not solely made up of drupal

00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:11,360
developers

00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,000
you need a team with a diverse skill set

00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,320
and

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,479
skills in many disciplines in order to

00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,479
be a good drupal team

00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:19,600
from product owners all the way through

00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:21,520
quality assurance

00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,759
there are a lot of different roles that

00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,880
will make up your team

00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,200
and what i've done here is i've put

00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:29,119
together a little graphic

00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,799
about what a team could look like and

00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:33,439
the roles that could be involved

00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,960
in building or maintaining a digital

00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:37,600
experience with drupal

00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,000
and there there are a lot of people on

00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,640
this

00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,880
on this screen i've represented each

00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,799
role as a separate person

00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,079
but a person can have multiple roles on

00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:48,880
your team

00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:49,600
depending on factors like skill sets or

00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,640
budgets

00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:54,960
or timelines so for example

00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,799
one of your developers may have skills

00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,799
in the devops realm

00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,000
which can bring some efficiencies to the

00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:03,040
team

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,399
another example is your marketer may

00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:07,759
wear mini hats they can be the content

00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:09,440
editor for the site

00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:12,000
and they want to be hands-on all through

00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,760
the process and that marketer may also

00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,840
be responsible for

00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,040
measuring your site's engagement and

00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,080
conversions

00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:22,560
so they may be wearing the analytics and

00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:25,120
insight hat as well

00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,480
and depending on where your site is in

00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,120
its life cycle

00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,680
the amount of time each role is utilized

00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,599
will

00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:34,319
change or evolve one of the first steps

00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:37,200
that you can take

00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:38,000
to figure out where your team is today

00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:41,840
is

00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:45,120
to map out the talent you have already

00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,480
and what what gaps exist and look at

00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,160
where your team needs to be in the

00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,800
future and

00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:52,400
the key here is to do this assessment

00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,800
role by role

00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:57,200
so looking at your current development

00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:59,920
staff do you need more developers

00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,120
do you need to find an experienced

00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:04,239
designer

00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:06,959
that knows how to design for the web and

00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:09,599
for content management systems

00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:10,959
and after you've identified where all

00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:12,959
those gaps are

00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:14,000
you'll need to find people to to fill

00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,640
those roles

00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,599
but how do you go about finding the

00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,319
right people

00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:20,319
on your team

00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:27,200
well the first thing to keep in mind is

00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,840
uh that the team will not be static over

00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,959
time

00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,400
uh not only can the needed roles change

00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,280
depending on whether you're building a

00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,640
site

00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:38,640
or operating and maintaining it and

00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,159
the skills required won't be needed at

00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,640
the same frequency as well

00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:44,720
for example when you're building the

00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:47,280
site for the first time you may need

00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:49,519
four developers full time for several

00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,319
months to get the site launched

00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:53,680
but then post launch you may only need

00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:56,799
one or two developers

00:03:53,680 --> 00:04:00,080
for a few hours per week to do bug fixes

00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:03,120
or apply drupal updates and to add small

00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:05,760
enhancements to the site

00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,400
so to illustrate this let's let's go

00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,120
back to

00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,319
our full team here and see how the roles

00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,599
change depending on

00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:14,000
where in the life cycle they are so uh

00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:17,199
here we

00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,320
have the full team again and uh we're

00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:23,519
going to transition this

00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:23,519
into the conceive and build phase

00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,680
so when we're in the sites conceive and

00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:31,759
build phase we can see that the needed

00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,880
roles are focused around supporting the

00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:34,960
activities

00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,240
that get the site launched get the

00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,400
project out the door

00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,320
and there's a lot of work to do in

00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,000
designing and building and launching the

00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:44,000
new site

00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,680
for example the the product owner is

00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,080
there to gather the requirements for the

00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,479
site

00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:50,560
and determine what the site needs to do

00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:52,560
and the experience designer crafts the

00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:55,360
visual and functional experience of the

00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,040
site based off of those requirements

00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:59,040
and then you have the the technical

00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:02,320
architect and the developers

00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:04,800
to plan out and execute the site build

00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,919
working alongside quality assurance to

00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,400
confirm

00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:10,400
that the site works as intended and you

00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:12,080
have project managers

00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,840
there to keep everything on track

00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,639
because we all know we need to stay on

00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,080
track

00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:17,759
and you have the content editor or

00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,600
content creator to build out

00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:21,840
the content for the site once it goes

00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,840
live

00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:27,120
and once the site is live and it's built

00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:30,639
uh the team needs to operate

00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:34,080
in uh in a way that supports a

00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:34,960
ongoing live site this can include

00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:38,000
developers

00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:40,720
to do again the bug fixes minor

00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,880
site enhancements uh devops to make sure

00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:45,280
that the site keeps up and running

00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:47,280
applying security updates to the servers

00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,960
uh content editor to keep the content

00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:52,160
fresh and up to date

00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:54,000
uh marketing analytics insights seo

00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,280
all to understand engagement and

00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,240
conversions and

00:05:55,280 --> 00:06:00,080
adjust the site accordingly we still

00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,120
need that that project manager to keep

00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,080
the team in motion

00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,840
on a day-to-day basis and if the site is

00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,720
evolving over time we'll need the

00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:09,199
product owner

00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,960
and experienced designer to flesh out

00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:13,360
those new features and functionality for

00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:16,639
the site

00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:19,440
so this adds another question

00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:20,720
should you build your entire drupal team

00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,639
in-house

00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,240
or should you outsource some of it or

00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:26,479
maybe even all of it

00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,680
and there is a spectrum of options

00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:30,000
available to you

00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,120
at one end again there's the the full

00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,639
hire out the team

00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,560
dedicated to building and maintaining

00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:37,520
the site and on the other end

00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:39,520
is outsourcing everything to an agency

00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:41,680
that has the skills that you need

00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:43,440
and the perfect solution for you might

00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,440
be somewhere in the middle

00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:48,319
for example you could go the route of

00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,960
hiring an agency to do the build and

00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,800
then

00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,720
find and train your own people to

00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,400
maintain the site this will grant you

00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,800
the benefits of having

00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:58,800
top-notch experts build your site and

00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,720
then letting you operate and maintain

00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:03,680
what they've built

00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,560
and this also option is also beneficial

00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,960
because

00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,720
your partner of choice uh once they're

00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,720
finished with the site build

00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,400
they can actually be a great resource in

00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,599
helping you hire

00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,520
and train the talent you need to

00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:17,680
maintain the site and they can also

00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,720
serve as a consulting resource in the

00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,120
future when

00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,880
you have future phases of the site being

00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:26,000
planned out

00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:27,280
your strategy can and likely will shift

00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,599
over time

00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:31,919
so your approach to your drupal project

00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:35,280
team should reflect that

00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:36,800
even if your long-term desire is to do

00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:40,000
it all in-house

00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,759
you can you can ease into that by

00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,120
going through and evolving your approach

00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,520
over time

00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:47,280
some of some of our clients uh bring us

00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:50,080
in at the start of a build

00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:51,039
and they have us uh create that strong

00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,680
foundation

00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:54,240
then they actually team with us uh to

00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,360
help them

00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:59,599
find and train their drupal talent that

00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,840
that we'll be learning alongside us

00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:03,039
and ultimately they end up taking over

00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,280
the entire project

00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:06,800
in-house once we're completed with the

00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:09,759
project

00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:11,199
and when when deciding to to hire for

00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:14,400
your team

00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:16,560
it takes time and effort to sift through

00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,599
resumes look at portfolios and work

00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,199
samples

00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:21,280
and do interviews to find the right

00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,240
person or people to staff on your

00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:25,280
project

00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:28,400
and as many of us probably know

00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:31,599
finding or growing good drupal talent

00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:33,440
isn't always easy so

00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:35,680
i want to take a few minutes that we

00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,360
have left and give you some ideas

00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:38,800
about how you can find the right drupal

00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,919
talent for your team or

00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:42,800
how you can can grow it yourself the

00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:44,800
first thing to do

00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:47,440
is to do exactly what you're doing today

00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:49,600
get involved in the drupal community

00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,839
it's a great place to network and find

00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:54,640
people who can help you reach your goals

00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:55,200
for your dribble platform next would be

00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:58,160
to

00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,519
to do some networking in other areas

00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:02,000
where you can find people

00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:02,880
uh obvious places like facebook and

00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,560
twitter

00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,240
and linkedin and other online

00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,880
communities where the talent you're

00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,959
looking for is represented

00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,160
other places that might not seem obvious

00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:14,240
initially

00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:16,160
would be drupal meetups and drupal camps

00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:19,279
that are going on in your area or

00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:20,959
virtually nowadays or even

00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:22,320
finding slack groups that are centered

00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:25,760
around

00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:27,120
drupal php symphony javascript

00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,880
joining and engaging in these

00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:31,920
communities may result in finding

00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:35,120
that person that you're looking for

00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:37,360
and if you do go the route of

00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:39,120
building your own talent you can really

00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,440
leverage the drupal community

00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,399
and events like drupalcon and camps to

00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:45,760
learn from other

00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:46,399
people's experience and stories for me

00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:49,120
personally

00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:50,000
that's how i learn a lot of what i know

00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:53,279
about drupal

00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,040
i learned at community events and it's

00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:57,200
also just a great way to kick start your

00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,959
drupal journey

00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:01,120
and some of that and for some of that

00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:03,120
journey you may have to

00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,320
adapt and take a longer road than you

00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:07,200
initially planned

00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:09,120
and that's okay and and there are so

00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:13,120
many resources online that can help

00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:16,000
from amazing guides uh and uh

00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:17,200
tutorials on drupal.org to stack

00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,720
exchange

00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:23,680
there are many many blogs from amazing

00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,399
drupalists and agencies and all of these

00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:28,240
are great

00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:28,240
places to shorten up that road

00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:35,440
so what makes uh a group of people

00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:37,200
into a great team well uh

00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,640
countless words have been written on

00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,200
this topic and

00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,959
i do not consider myself an expert in

00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:45,200
this room at all

00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:47,680
i'll let everyone who has written the

00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,760
words and the articles and the books

00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:52,160
uh really serve as the experts that they

00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:55,519
are about what makes the team great

00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:58,399
but i personally consistently see

00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:59,040
three traits uh exhibited by successful

00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:00,240
teams

00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,360
that i've had the privilege of working

00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,440
with so i'm going to share those with

00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:06,560
you

00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:09,680
the first is there is a

00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:11,920
shared vision for the team's success

00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:14,640
everyone knows what success looks like

00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:17,360
and they're marching in that direction

00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:19,920
next would be there's a bias to have a

00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:22,320
pursuit of the team success

00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,440
that comes before the individual success

00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,959
or achievement

00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:27,519
or accolades and the third and i would

00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:30,480
argue

00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:32,880
the the least important on this list is

00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:35,360
the ability to do the work at hand

00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,399
if you have the most talented uh

00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,480
individual

00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:40,640
in a specific skill set on your team but

00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:44,240
they can't function within that team

00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:47,600
your team is not set up for success

00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:50,480
so uh thank you for your time today um

00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,360
and feel free to reach out to me i have

00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,560

00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,600
email and twitter handle here in the

00:11:54,560 --> 00:12:11,839
slide

00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:11,839
so thank you very much

00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:20,160
