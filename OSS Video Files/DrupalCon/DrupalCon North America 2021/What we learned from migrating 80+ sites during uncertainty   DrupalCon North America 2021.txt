and we're going to share our experiences

00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:20,240
on what we've learned from migrating

00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,039
over 80 websites during uncertainty and

00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,560
that

00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:24,160
such uncertainty is of course the

00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,920
pandemic

00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,439
we can move on to the next slide we'll

00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,400

00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:42,000
business analyst at imagex

00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:45,120
working in the same capacity on this

00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,360
project a very exciting project

00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,280
and i will be jumping into the expo

00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,599

if you need to contact me you can find

00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:56,800
my contact there on the screen

00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:59,200
marta imagexmedia.com

00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,200
thank you

00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,840
all right though start us off with a

00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,519
nice quote because this does say a lot

00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,680
about our experience together on this

00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,680
project so from helen keller alone we

00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,720
can do so little and together we can do

00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,599
so much

00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,159
so this was a herculean effort with not

00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:16,159
only

00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:18,640
the team that you see here on the screen

00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:20,239
but many of us were involved

00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,440
that are not able to join us today for

00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:22,879
the panel discussion because we're

00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,920
limited to our numbers

00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:26,560
but it was a really great exercise in

00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,480
teamwork

00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,080
and uh just moving on to the next slide

00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,879
we're going to get into the

00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,680
the challenge uh steph will take that on

00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,920
and describe

00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,760
the the what we did and then i'll

00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,120
elaborate on that after that so moving

00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:42,239
on to

00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,920
staff's part thank you absolutely so

00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:46,640
um starting a little bit from the

00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:50,080
beginning trinity had several

00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:52,080
micro sites on the drupal 7 platform

00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,120
knowing that we had to migrate to drupal

00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,040
8. so

00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,319
we actually started this project back in

00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,400
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:00,799
and we basically phase it out in two

00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,239
phases so phase one was completed in

00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:04,959
fall of 2020

00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:06,159
it consisted of migrating our main

00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:08,959
trinity website

00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:10,239
which was new.trinity.edu at the

00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:12,879
beginning

00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:15,599
over into drupal 8 and then we worked

00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:17,519
with imagex specifically on this project

00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:19,600
which was migrating the additional

00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:23,120
microsites which contained

00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:24,160
approximately 80 plus university offices

00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:27,520
and university

00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,800
program websites to also transfer over

00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,600
to drupal 8.

00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,600
so before just migrating we had to kind

00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,680
of see what we were working with

00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,759
and so here are some of the challenges

00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,560
that we considered before the project

00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,400
began

00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,680
in order to help us out with our project

00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,000
planning so

00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,919
as we started to really really look at

00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,560
the content that we had

00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:50,000
um we discovered that our content was

00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:53,040
like a file cabinet

00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,759
so at trinity we have a decentralized

00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,919
approach

00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:56,960
where we rely on what we call web

00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:59,919
champions or

00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:01,680
department or office content owners to

00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:04,080
basically be accountable for

00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,919
the upkeep of their websites it's great

00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,720
when you have a small team but in our

00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,720
instance

00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,039
over the years it really started to

00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:13,120
develop like a file cabinet

00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:14,160
there was plenty of outdated content

00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,240
there was

00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,919
duplicate content and there's just

00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:21,039
content that we threw up

00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:23,600
and we forgot about over the years so

00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:25,919
um that was kind of the main driving

00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:29,039
point is that we knew we had to

00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:31,680
um focus on our end users number one

00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:33,840
because they were dying for a better

00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,600
website experience and so we kind of

00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,080
took the merry condo approach so if

00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,000
those

00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:40,160
are those of you who are familiar with

00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,880
that next fix special where she

00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,280
brings joy to organizing and tidying it

00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,360
up

00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,880
we kind of took that approach before we

00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,759
began this project

00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,320
um and then another reason drupal forced

00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:52,960
our hand

00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,360
and we glad and we're so glad they did

00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,000
um

00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,199
so we were on drupal 7 for at least six

00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,080
or seven years

00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:00,639
and we were excited about the um drupal

00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,360
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:04,479
platform capabilities and also the end

00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,600
of life date

00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:09,520
basically forced us to

00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,960
make do this project like we had to do

00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:14,639
it there was no choice

00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:16,240
um and then another reason is that

00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,680
like i mentioned earlier we had a bunch

00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,080
of microsites

00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,759
that were hard to manage just from a

00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:24,160
small team's perspective

00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:25,120
and we also had a dedicated marketing

00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,080
website

00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,639
which was new.trinity and then also a

00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,919
public

00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:34,720
but not so private intranet

00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:36,720
where all of the internal content for

00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:39,600
offices and departments lived

00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:41,120
on inside.training.edu and that's where

00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,680
we're going to talk about the most

00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:45,840
the 80 plus websites that we migrated

00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:49,160
from inside that training.edu

00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:50,800
into our new big cohesive family of

00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:55,680
trinity.edu

00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:55,680
mvp website next slide please

00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,840
okay so this is just a quick example to

00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:04,720
kind of show you that we were

00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:06,880
successful so here's an example of a

00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:09,919
residential life office website

00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:12,479
so on the left you will see

00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:13,840
their main menu and this is not all of

00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:16,880
it so there are about 13

00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:19,520
items in this top level menu tree

00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,800
they're about there were about 50 menu

00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,720
items in total

00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,800
and so what we did we worked together

00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:27,440
with imagex to basically focus

00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,319
on information architecture if anything

00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,400
we wanted to do

00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,599
out of this project and within this time

00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,080
frame that we had

00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:36,160
before the end of life late we knew that

00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,880
we had to make sure our architecture was

00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,759
solid

00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,960
and so we took both expertise from the

00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:43,599
msx team

00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:45,120
and then also did our own research to

00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:47,199
really figure out what our

00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,240
end users need the most and that's what

00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,960
you see on the left

00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,000
on the right side a beautiful nice and

00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:54,400
clean top-level

00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,520
architecture that's easy to navigate and

00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:58,240
we also leverage

00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,120
the new features within our drupal 8

00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,280
platform

00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,240
in order to create drop down menus and

00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,639
etc

00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,879
to help the end users get to the content

00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:09,360
that they were most interested in

00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:09,360
next slide

00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,440
okay so let's talk about scope and

00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,240
approach

00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:18,080
so in total there were 85 sites in the

00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,199
second phase that needed to be divided

00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:22,960
and conquered

00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:26,319
um because of number one the pandemic

00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:28,879
and um the small size of our team

00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:29,919
we knew we needed to leverage imagex's

00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:31,919
expertise

00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:33,200
as they had a lot more resources than

00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:35,680
our than we did

00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,599
but then we were also able to scrounge

00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:38,800
up some resources to help us get us

00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:42,240
through these times

00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:43,440
so we divided the sites equally we first

00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,360
focused on

00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,720
keeping the trinity sites that we were

00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,040
responsible for

00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,959
for those really high-level

00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:53,519
student-focused journey

00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:54,560
websites that were key indicators and

00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:57,680
key

00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:59,680
points that we could continue to measure

00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:01,120
and make those sites the most optimal

00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,959
because we knew we had to keep and

00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:06,080
retain those customers

00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:08,000
we also took the complicated site so

00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,839
at trinity we do a lot of things that

00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,080
are very very unique

00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:12,959
unique to trinity that's not unique

00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,440
that's not

00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:16,959
common in the liberal arts world or just

00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:19,920
in higher education

00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:20,640
so a lot of these sites we had to read

00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,360
understand

00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:24,480
and ask questions to actually understand

00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,480
what they were trying to do

00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:29,120
and what and how these sites actually

00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,760
fit in so we took the complicated sites

00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,440
that

00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,839
that needed a lot of institutional

00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,279
knowledge and we let imagex take the

00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,920
reins and trusted them

00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:38,959
with being the expert on some of those

00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,120
sites that

00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:42,080
have common journeys with outside of

00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,160
higher ed so

00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,440
for example there's a human resources

00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:48,720
partner department

00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:52,080
at um mainly every you know

00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:53,120
operation or institution and so they

00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,680
were able to

00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,440
leverage outside expertise and to tell

00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:00,320
us what we should be doing

00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:02,480
rather than trying to make you what we

00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:05,839
were doing uniquely at trinity

00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:08,560
work as best practice um as far as a

00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:10,959
time frame we had six months to do this

00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:12,079
so we knew we couldn't make everything

00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:14,320
perfect

00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:16,079
as bad as i wanted to make sure that all

00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,320
the content read beautifully

00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:19,200
everything was designed perfectly we had

00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,920
to target in

00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:24,480
and zero in on two key aspects so we

00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:26,880
focused heavily on content strategy

00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,320
and information architecture in order to

00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,720
make sure it was solid

00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,560
and then over time throughout the years

00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,399
we will continue to work with our web

00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:36,240
champions our departments

00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:37,839
in order to continue to improve their

00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,959
content

00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:43,279
next slide okay

00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:44,800
so now i kind of talked about the

00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:47,120
approach

00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:48,320
let's talk about how we basically kind

00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,959
of stayed organized

00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,839
as we work together with imagex as a

00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:54,480
partner

00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:55,040
um and also with our campus stakeholders

00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,320
so

00:10:55,040 --> 00:11:00,560
we um are a google school so we use

00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,839
g suite and so we knew whatever

00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:04,320
communication tool

00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:06,320
and also project tools in order to stay

00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,160
organized had to fall within something

00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:12,000
that was easy to use

00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:15,360
easy to share and also easy to

00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,079
find so we created some project planning

00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,680
templates

00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:21,920
um in in terms of google sheets and

00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,680
we used some stakeholder surveys which

00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:26,240
were google forms

00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:27,760
we created a standard content strategy

00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:31,040
and information doc

00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:32,720
for all sites so it was easy to

00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,959
kind of follow the template and figure

00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:37,600
out what key things we needed to add

00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:38,160
and what key things we needed to include

00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,200
and then

00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:43,680
on top of this we knew that essentially

00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:46,000
we didn't have time to make wireframes

00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,600
for every single site or full-fledged

00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,200
designs for every office

00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,040
it would take us years to get those

00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,959
things approved with our stakeholders

00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:55,519
so we came up with an idea of a

00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:58,000
component design library

00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:59,279
basically taking elements that we had on

00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,440
our current site

00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:03,040
um learning from the dewey decimal

00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,880
system and also

00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:07,760
getting inspiration from a cheesecake

00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:09,600
factory menu of like we needed to

00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:12,079
organize these components so that

00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:15,760
they're easy to find easy to indicate

00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:18,240
and also we had an option for

00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:20,320
any type of content this helped

00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,160
tremendously with our stakeholders

00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,680
because it helped them visualize

00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:25,920
the content that we were writing in the

00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:27,279
google docs and how it would formulate

00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:30,720
onto the website

00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:31,200
and the um little green indicator that

00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,399
you see

00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:37,519
on the screen where it says to call 32

00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:39,519
that's how we identified where

00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:42,000
what component the content should fall

00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:43,760
in so that it helps during the building

00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,959
phase for our builders to not

00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:49,360
guess on what to build and so

00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:50,480
this was all really really helpful and

00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,399
the ones that you see

00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,240
on the screen that have links are

00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:55,680
actually takeaway documents for you guys

00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,399
so when you get the recording you'll be

00:12:55,680 --> 00:13:00,160
able to see

00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:00,160
kind of a sample of our templates

00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:07,360
thank you steph uh yes and we will have

00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,839
just another housekeeping item we're

00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,680
gonna

00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:11,440
about 10 to 15 minutes at the end for

00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,240
questions but we are monitoring the chat

00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,040
as well

00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,160
so happy to share those resources so

00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,160
steph describe

00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:20,160
the challenge and i'll elaborate a

00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:22,240
little bit more on what you talked about

00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,600
already for the how we did it so on this

00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,519
slide you can see

00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,360
we use a lot of different systems in

00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:29,040
order to collaborate

00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,800
we were using both of our google drives

00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:32,240
but primarily trinities

00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,240
because of all of the stakeholders that

00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:36,720
needed access to

00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:38,160
the documents we couldn't have lived

00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,240
without zoom of course

00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:42,240
as many of us in the pandemic with

00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:45,120
relying on that for our

00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,440
video and essentially remote face time

00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,480
and

00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,680
our meetings so we connected our project

00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,720
management systems

00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:53,040
uh at imagex we use basecamp for you

00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,519
know

00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,800
client communications and to-do lists

00:13:55,519 --> 00:14:00,480
and storing important

00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:02,560
uh contractual documents and we use jira

00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,760
for the primarily the execution of

00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:06,240
projects so

00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,120
what i did was i created an epic and

00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,399
jira

00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:12,720
which linked to each one of trinity's

00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:13,839
if you want to call them sites or epics

00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,639
in air table

00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:18,480
so that we had the two systems connected

00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:20,399
from there i also had a dashboard

00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,760
in a google sheet so it was an at a

00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:23,440
glance view

00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:25,760
at all of the projects we were working

00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:27,360
on so projects and sites and using that

00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:29,600
term interchangeably

00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,480
so that that spreadsheet i was in almost

00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,320
every day as

00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,760
it was my dashboard but it had links out

00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:37,120
to airtable it had

00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:40,160
uh links out to jira as well

00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:42,160
now we're we're very lucky that uh we're

00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:44,000
like an extended team we're all one team

00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:46,160
really so we had

00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,440
trinity team members in our jira working

00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,959
with us directly

00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,279
and the way i chose to structure the

00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:52,639
tickets uh because there was no real

00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:54,399
development work on this site

00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:56,399
we did have the developer giving us some

00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:58,880
oversight if needed

00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:00,079
but we structured each site with three

00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,639
main juror tickets

00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:04,480
one was for the business analysis and

00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:06,079
with links to each of the supporting

00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,040
documents and it allowed martin

00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:09,199
indonesia

00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,560
to take notes and provide statuses and

00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:12,720
where they were at

00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:14,079
then we had a separate link ticket to

00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,000
the content strategy

00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:18,160
so once we were done the analysis we

00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,680
would pass that over to the trinity team

00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:21,440
they could give us feedback on the

00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:23,920
information architecture

00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:25,680
and then imagex is responsible for the

00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:27,440
home page content strategy

00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:29,279
while that was happening the trinity

00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:31,120
team was working very closely with their

00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:32,000
stakeholders to build out the remaining

00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,560
content

00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,560
and strategy with their stakeholders the

00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:40,240
last ticket that we had was for the

00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:42,000
site built and this was again

00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,920
a combination of our team working teams

00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,639
working very closely together

00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:48,560
where we were building out the sites so

00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:50,720
once those three tickets were done

00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,600
uh they all got moved to done i could

00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,920
close out

00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,600
the epic and i can tell you that the

00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:57,759
jira roadmap feature was

00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,120
a very good friend of mine through this

00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:00,639
project

00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:03,120
one of the challenges really was staying

00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:05,519
organized because it was for us

00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:07,040
40 websites so 40 projects within a

00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:09,920
project it was a lot to

00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:11,199
to really uh to manage of course we have

00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,800
drupal in the center

00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:14,800
couldn't live without drupal this is

00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:18,639
this is the reason we're all here

00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:18,880
and uh acquia as well um i note on asana

00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:21,519
i

00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,720
initially started that was a trinity uh

00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:24,800
that's where they manage all of their

00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,880
details for projects similar to how we

00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,240
use jira and i started in there and i

00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:30,959
realized i didn't need

00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:32,639
to be in there because trinity was in

00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:35,199
algeria so rather than and

00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:36,880
muddle things and make it complicated i

00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:38,399
i went in took a look around and thought

00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:40,079
i'm going to get too many notifications

00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,040
and asked if it was okay if i just stuck

00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:44,240
with jira and

00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:46,560
the decision was yes that's fine

00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,600
uh on the top right we have figma staff

00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:50,160
alluded to the

00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,759
design components that were used those

00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,279
were really helpful in how we referenced

00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:54,720
them in the the content strategy

00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:56,800
document

00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:58,959
and uh slack another great

00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:02,000
communications tool of course

00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:04,799
we we were in trinity slack so we had a

00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,000
special slack channel set up just for us

00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:08,000
so we could maintain

00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,919
tight communications and steph didn't

00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:13,039
mind with my daily reminders

00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:13,679
of asking if things were ready yet so

00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:15,760
all of this

00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:17,520
all of these tools came together and at

00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:19,520
the very end a whole lot of love

00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:21,679
you know teamwork trust open

00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,160
communication daily communication is

00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:25,760
really

00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:28,559
how we got this all done we can go on to

00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:31,440
the next one please

00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:32,240
all right so here's where we get into

00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,720
the discussion

00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:36,720
so i know we've given you the overview

00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,320
of of the what and the how and as i

00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,440
mentioned we can hold some time for

00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,120
questions at the end

00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:43,360
but if we go to the next one i'm going

00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:45,840
to start and put the question out

00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:47,600
starting with you steph uh if you can

00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:50,240
share what your biggest challenge was

00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:53,039
starting out in this project

00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:54,240
my my big challenge on the trinity side

00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:56,000
was resources

00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,400
like i mentioned we are a three-person

00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,039
team out of 22 marketers that we're also

00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,480
working on

00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:05,520
additional projects so with the size

00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:06,240
and scope of the project i really needed

00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,720
to

00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,919
push for resources on the trinity side

00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,960
because i couldn't

00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:15,840
depend on imagex to do everything they

00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:17,679
do not have the institutional knowledge

00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:19,280
and there is just some part of the

00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:22,400
content on our site that

00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:25,360
trinity needs to own and also develop

00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:27,600
um so i was able to at least get some

00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:30,240
additional resources

00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:31,520
within our marketing team and that

00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,520
actually pulled from

00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:35,520
you know people being vice presidents

00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:38,240
and above

00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:40,480
in terms of and director levels in order

00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:43,280
to get this thing done

00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:44,080
the other biggest challenge too is just

00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:46,080
choosing

00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,919
what to focus on like i mentioned

00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,600
earlier i'm a perfectionist i wanted

00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:52,880
everything to be perfect but that is

00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:54,480
just not scalable or attainable we

00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,799
really had to

00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,520
think about what did we actually need to

00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:59,840
do

00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:01,440
before this end of life date and what

00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:04,799
would put us on a path

00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:08,320
to move forward that we did not have to

00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:11,760
go back and redo work that we did now

00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:13,440
um later

00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:15,600
and i'm also a bit of a perfectionist

00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,160
myself so it's nice to work with another

00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,000
one

00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:20,160
but as you said we had to let go of some

00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,360
of those tendencies in order to get

00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,120
stuff done

00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:25,120
uh so marta you're coming in with the

00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,600
senior business analyst hat on what was

00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:28,480
your

00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,960
uh greatest challenge starting out thank

00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,600
you

00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:33,600
uh oh one of them is similar i had they

00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:36,160
went knowing when enough is enough

00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:38,240
i definitely have a perfectness

00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:40,720
perfectionist hat on as well

00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:42,559
um but understanding just being

00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,559
conscious of the scope

00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:45,840
and the boundary so how far can we take

00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:49,200
things to get

00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:51,679
uh the biggest improvement

00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,960
team another piece was scheduling

00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:55,760
meetings um

00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:57,440
because we had several of uh the

00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:59,520
websites we're trying to manage at the

00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,600
same time

00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:03,360
and uh wanting to be most efficient of

00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:05,600
our time initially we set up

00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:06,480
uh placeholder meetings for them to come

00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,799
in and choose

00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,960
what worked best for them and we would

00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:13,200
kind of ascertain like set aside

00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,720
some just for this client i'm saying

00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,159
client interchangeable with each of the

00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,840
different websites

00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:20,480
and then another set of time blocks for

00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:22,000
the next uh website

00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:24,000
but we realized that wasn't efficient

00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,200
someone might not have time until a week

00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,200
later and then we've lost that

00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,640
opportunity of time slot so when

00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,320
we changed that and made it more

00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:33,520
efficient opening it up to

00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:35,679
here are all of our time slots just

00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:37,679
relabel things so that they understood

00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:38,400
which ones are mine versus anisha's time

00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:40,880
so

00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,919
um and then we just have to uh

00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,520
cross-reference

00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:46,480
who had accepted it to know which

00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:48,799
website uh it was for and that made

00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:50,080
that far more efficient and we were able

00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:53,120
to make up time

00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:54,480
and ground on that uh probably the last

00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:57,039
one is just

00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:58,559
the enormity of the context switching

00:20:57,039 --> 00:21:01,600
and multitasking

00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:02,640
having 40 websites between anisha and

00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,480
myself

00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:06,000
and a different set of stakeholders for

00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:08,880
each one um

00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,760
i ended up setting up i have a mac so i

00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:13,120
set up a different

00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:15,280
desktop for each website so i could just

00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:16,320
swipe quickly to the one i needed okay

00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:19,760
this one is

00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:22,799
uh uh residential

00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:24,880
uh this one is human resources etc and

00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:26,320
then have all the tabs open and ready

00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:28,400
it didn't mean i had to upgrade my

00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:29,440
computer though to handle the chrome

00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:33,200
tabs but

00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:33,200
it definitely made it all worthwhile

00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:37,520
thank you marta um there are some

00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,240
questions coming in steph i don't have a

00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,000
chance to

00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,760
browse them if you want to give some you

00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,840
know in time answers but if not we'll

00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:45,919
get some at the end

00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:48,080
uh i'll just jump in over to anisha

00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:49,200
um with you know similar role as marta

00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,880
can you share what your biggest

00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,799
challenge was starting out

00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,240
yeah absolutely so of course with the

00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:56,159
requirement of building out an

00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,200
information architecture and content

00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:00,720
strategy

00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:02,559
um i came in just making sure that the

00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,000
the strategy that i'm offering is

00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:05,600
thinking about the broader picture and

00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,400
the broader lens and not just

00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:09,360
isolated to those individual sites and

00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,200
so i think that

00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:13,679
in itself was a challenge just getting

00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,919
uh quickly ramped up to the requirements

00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:18,480
that each of the stakeholders had

00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:20,240
um and then offering up a strategy that

00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,360
was not isolated to each of the

00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:24,000
microsites and it's

00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:24,880
it's an approach that can be replicated

00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,080
across

00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:29,360
the broader um i guess holistic view of

00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:32,559
the site

00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:34,480
so one of the things that did help me um

00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:36,320
and i think that steph and team

00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,720
stephanie and her team did a great job

00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:39,120
at this

00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:41,039
is essentially coordinating upfront

00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:44,159
responses from the stakeholders

00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:44,480
um we i know the the team had initially

00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:47,039
sent

00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,520
out essentially a survey um trying to

00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:49,679
get a

00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:50,559
really good gauge from the stakeholders

00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:52,960
in terms

00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:54,080
on a couple of things one um just

00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:56,320
understanding their

00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:57,600
degree of knowledge and expertise in the

00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:59,679
digital space

00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:01,360
and so we didn't go into our meetings

00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:02,159
with these individual stakeholders

00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:04,080
assuming

00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:05,280
that they had that digital knowledge and

00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:08,240
expertise

00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:09,600
um and then second just getting a better

00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:12,799
sense and understanding of

00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:13,440
their current content best practices if

00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:16,960
any

00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:18,880
um so i think coming in with that um

00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:20,240
initial set of understanding was really

00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:22,640
helpful for me when

00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:24,400
i you know dealt with the the

00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:27,520
stakeholders one-on-one

00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:29,679
um and it also allowed me to

00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,880
keep some key factors in mind when

00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:33,280
presenting an ia

00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,480
or a content strategy and keeping in

00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:36,320
mind

00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:38,000
with respect to their current knowledge

00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,480
and expertise and ensuring that we're

00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,440
not

00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:42,320
putting something um as a proposal that

00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:44,640
requires

00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:45,600
uh further or added maintenance in the

00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,360
future that they just

00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:49,760
the stakeholders just will not be able

00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:51,200
to sustain um so it was a bit more of

00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:53,520
that holistic approach

00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:55,200
um just keeping that in mind was

00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:58,240
initially a big challenge for me

00:23:55,200 --> 00:24:01,679
but um yeah the the knowledge um that we

00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,679
gained up front was really helpful

00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,000
tanisha for myself uh you know i

00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:07,760
mentioned earlier we did use a lot of

00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,679
tools but i think the the biggest

00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:11,840
challenge for me was up front and

00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:13,279
planning the project and the planning

00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:15,120
actually started when we were uh

00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:16,640
estimating before we started the project

00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:19,440
of course and so we already went in

00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:22,480
having a sense of the size of each site

00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:24,159
some were one pages five ten fifty and

00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:26,240
some were a few hundred pages so it

00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:27,840
really was across the board

00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:30,080
so it was really sitting down and

00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:31,760
looking at the size of each site and

00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:33,919
stacking it accordingly so that we could

00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:35,120
tackle the biggest most complicated

00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:36,799
sites first

00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,679
to ensure that we would have enough time

00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:40,080
to reach the right amount of

00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:42,000
stakeholders and get the analysis done

00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:43,279
and and that was like residential life

00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,200
is the one you saw was the one we

00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:47,440
actually tackled first

00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,559
so it felt like an uphill climb i wasn't

00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:50,000
always sure

00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:51,679
if we were gonna make it in the early

00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,360
days you know i was kind of hoping for

00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:54,240
the best but but knew in the end we

00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:56,159
would

00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:58,080
um but as we reach you know we started

00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:58,559
in decem september last year and as we

00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,400
reached

00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:02,320
december i started to see a lot of the

00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:04,000
sites getting uh you know knocked off

00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:05,360
the list which was really encouraging

00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,039
and then a lot of the big ones were

00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:09,039
completed by january

00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:10,559
and so when we reached late january

00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:12,480
early february we could start to see a

00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:15,919
lot of the smaller ones

00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:18,080
being completed and you know building so

00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:19,279
many sites concurrently at that point

00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:21,440
but pleased to say that we got

00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:23,200
everything done on time and with no last

00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:25,679
minute crunch which was uh pretty

00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,679
amazing

00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:29,360
all right let's move on to the next one

00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:32,480
please

00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:34,320
oh this is a good one so we've had a lot

00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:36,559
of uncertainty in the last year as

00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:37,760
uh i'm sure many of you can relate to

00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:40,159
and especially with

00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:42,400
pandemic we've had to adjust to any you

00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:43,919
know working in a different way

00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,520
and just uncertainty around the pandemic

00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:48,000
in general uh

00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:48,640
so i'll start off with you marta how did

00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,240
you handle

00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:52,000
the situation last year and working

00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:54,720
remotely and you know everything that

00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,799
you've had to deal with with pandemic

00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:58,480
it was definitely interesting let's put

00:25:56,799 --> 00:26:00,480
it that way uh i think

00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:02,640
being in the right state of mind and

00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:05,840
being open and trying to be positive

00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:06,159
um uh this is our new adventure right

00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:09,600
now

00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:10,720
has definitely helped having a positive

00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:13,760
attitude

00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:15,360
um something that was quite critical for

00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:16,799
us in addition to that was having

00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:19,679
stephanie and her team

00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:21,039
providing those information on each of

00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:22,799
these different websites and their

00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:24,320
stakeholders

00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:25,760
understanding what's going on in their

00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:27,679
world the challenges they're currently

00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,320
dealing with what might be happening or

00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:30,720
not

00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:32,559
the best way to communicate with them

00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:35,039
that that really helped as well um

00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:36,400
because we didn't have that background

00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:37,840
in that context so

00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:40,159
that meant we could come in hit the

00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:43,200
ground running um

00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:46,159
be more uh i think

00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:47,760
uh be more patient or understanding as

00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:49,200
different things arose and being more

00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:52,240
flexible

00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:55,840
that was really really important uh

00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:57,360
one other uh fun aspect of

00:26:55,840 --> 00:27:00,000
working remotely is getting to know

00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:03,360
people and within their own home lives

00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:05,520
uh context it at another level of uh

00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:06,559
feeling connected with them and then

00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:10,240
with us as well

00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:12,720
um and uh it have interesting uh

00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:13,760
uh moments when you have i guess pets

00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:17,360
for children

00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:20,559
coming in um and it it just

00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:23,279
gave an extra level of levity to

00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:25,200
uh to it and would help reduce any of

00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:27,679
the anxiety or stress that just might be

00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,399
naturally part of having to work from

00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:31,840
home and

00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:35,760
being on sue all the time so

00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:37,440
that was great yes i can identify to the

00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:39,039
having the pet interruptions and

00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,559
i've got to know a lot of your children

00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:42,559
as well so it's been really

00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:43,760
a nice benefit of what's been going on

00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:45,600
with the last year

00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:47,200
uh anisha what was going on with you

00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,559
during the pandemic and then this

00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:52,640
transition to remote work

00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:54,240
yeah i'll actually stem off of mardis

00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:57,360
for me one of the things that i

00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:58,960
experienced or i just was cognizant that

00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:01,520
a lot of the stakeholders may be

00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:02,480
experiencing zoom fatigue as much as i

00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:05,360
was

00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:07,120
and so whenever i needed to schedule a

00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:10,480
meeting that required

00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:12,240
a lot of conversation and just a lot of

00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:14,960
strategizing and thinking and

00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:16,799
collaboration from the stakeholders i

00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:18,799
was a bit more conscious of scheduling

00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:19,200
them earlier in the morning catching

00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:22,080
them

00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,880
um before they were tired at the end of

00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,960
the day

00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:26,159
um just so that i can get their valuable

00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:28,159
insight and

00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:30,399
one of the other things that i took more

00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:31,679
of a conscious effort around is that

00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:33,360
you know a lot of these stakeholders

00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:34,240
were meeting me for the first time with

00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:36,320
no

00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:38,000
context or background to who i am and

00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:40,960
what my background is so

00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,159
having those conversations more upfront

00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:44,880
was really helpful

00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:46,399
um just you know like non-project

00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:48,720
related conversations

00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:49,440
um applying a little bit more of an

00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:52,000
empathy

00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:53,840
um towards our our stakeholders just

00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,200
starting to understand what their

00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:58,480
current challenges are

00:28:55,200 --> 00:29:00,240
outside of the project um that provided

00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:02,720
me with additional insight around

00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:03,440
what could potentially get in the way of

00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:05,440
you know their

00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:07,360
future contributions whenever or

00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:10,320
collaboration if required

00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:12,320
um so i think for for me it it

00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:14,240
definitely was an interesting time

00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:15,600
um but i think there was a lot of

00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:17,200
learnings that came out of it

00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:19,120
and just you know being a bit more

00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:21,520
conscious and trying to

00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:23,279
um have those non-project related

00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,760
conversations and the the conversations

00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:25,279
that came

00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:27,200
out of that was really interesting for

00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:30,000
me

00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:31,200
fantastic thank you and would you like

00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,159
to round out this question with your

00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,880
inputs

00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:36,080
yeah absolutely um definitely being

00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:38,080
empathetic

00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:41,200
to the times to what's going on in

00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:43,440
everyone's lives individually

00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:45,039
and also being empathetic to what's

00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:47,840
happening at the business so

00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:50,360
at trinity our team was being pulled

00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:53,440
left and right for emergency coved

00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:55,039
responses and communication

00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:56,720
the departments were scrambling to

00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:58,320
figure out what they were going to do

00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:01,919
for the summer and for the upcoming

00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:04,559
semesters and so we really just tried to

00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:05,200
take a step back take a breath and

00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:06,799
really

00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:09,440
understand what's happening in

00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:10,480
everyone's world to figure out how far

00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:12,960
we can push

00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:15,440
or how far we can actually get along so

00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:17,840
that progress is still made

00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:18,799
another big aspect too is trusting and

00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:21,039
respect

00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:22,320
so we've been working with imagex for a

00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:24,399
number of years

00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:26,559
and so we knew we had to lean on their

00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:29,760
expertise we had to trust them

00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:31,600
and we also had to respect um any

00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:33,360
type of recommendation they would they

00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:36,000
would give back to us

00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:36,480
it may not hit the mark 100 but it's

00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,360
okay

00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:41,279
as long as it made progress and as long

00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:42,960
as it was 70 or 80 percent where we

00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:44,880
could take it and move forward

00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:46,720
that's what we had to ground ourselves

00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:49,840
and care about the most

00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:51,679
to not let us get too focused in on

00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:53,600
being a perfectionist like i am

00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:55,039
um but allow us to keep kind of moving

00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:58,240
forward and also

00:30:55,039 --> 00:31:00,080
leaning on each other right so um

00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:01,840
there were times where marta anisha had

00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:04,240
to lean on me or

00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:05,679
our team in order to figure out what

00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:08,559
this content is or

00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:09,600
how do we um approach the stakeholder

00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:11,519
how do we

00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:13,760
communicate with them knowing that

00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:15,519
they're teaching classes or they're

00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:17,360
stressed in their own worlds or they're

00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:18,080
being pulled into some of these covid

00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:21,039
meetings

00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:22,559
that we just had no control over um so

00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:25,600
we had to basically

00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:26,320
kind of use that and say okay well if we

00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:29,279
can't rely

00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:29,679
100 on the stakeholder can we kind of

00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:32,320
think

00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:33,039
for them a little bit can we come to

00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:35,200
them with an

00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:36,399
option rather than saying what do you

00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:38,240
think

00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:40,480
and approaching it like well here's what

00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:42,399
we understand so far

00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:44,159
let us know if this hits the mark let us

00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:46,240
know how it doesn't hit the mark

00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:48,559
you know here's what we've researched or

00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:50,159
here's where we've pulled from or here's

00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:52,000
this type of content that we did

00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:54,399
similarly on another site

00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,480
um so trying to make the conversations

00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:57,360
easy as possible so people felt

00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:00,080
comfortable

00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:01,840
and they didn't feel pressured and also

00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:03,440
they were able to give us the answers

00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:06,320
that we actually needed in order to

00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:06,320
complete the project

00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:11,120
all right thank you staff i am seeing a

00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,559
lot of questions coming in and they're

00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:14,960
fantastic in the q a

00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:16,320
i i i'm hesitating on answering them

00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:17,760
right now we're trying to pay attention

00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:19,279
but we will scan through and we will

00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:20,240
reply to each and every one of you so

00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:23,039
thank you

00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:24,720
uh with about 20 minutes left let's go

00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:26,000
to the next slide we've got two more

00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:29,039
questions for the panel and then we'll

00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:31,279
jump into the audience q a

00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:33,039
all right starting with the you and

00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:34,640
nisha what would you say is the one

00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:36,559
thing that contributed to this project's

00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:40,240
success for you

00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:43,360
me it was a close observation of our

00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:44,159
partnership um just within imagex and

00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:47,279
our

00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:49,600
within our core team project team i felt

00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:52,159
like our team collaboration was

00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:53,120
uh so incredible um the the

00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:55,919
communication

00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:56,640
lines were always open um and sarah i

00:32:55,919 --> 00:32:59,120
felt like

00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:01,360
if i had a concern or any potential

00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:03,840
blocker i was able to easily come

00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:05,120
to you with those set of challenges and

00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:07,600
then on

00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:08,559
our partnership with um stephanie and

00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:11,360
her team

00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:12,880
i felt that they had a really close

00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:14,399
understanding of their stakeholders

00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:16,399
needs and requirements

00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:18,799
um as stephanie was mentioning earlier

00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:20,159
just you know coming in with a tighter

00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:22,960
partnership with

00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:24,080
them um on their stakeholders friends uh

00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:26,240
if there was ever

00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:27,919
a blocker on my side where i wasn't able

00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:29,200
to get the information that i needed

00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:32,000
from the stakeholder

00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:33,360
um i knew that i was able to rely on

00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,600
their project team to get

00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:38,320
access to those sort of information and

00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:40,320
so i think overall just the the synergy

00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:43,120
that we shared amongst us was

00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:45,360
was really valuable um and one last

00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:48,000
piece i wanted to mention i think

00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:49,919
because both marta and i had a similar

00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,440
set of responsibilities as far as this

00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:53,679
project was concerned

00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:55,840
um we had a lot of one-on-one sessions

00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:56,480
where we shared and exchanged ideas we

00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,480
were

00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,679
sometimes experiencing the same type of

00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:01,279
blockers so

00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:03,120
um there might might have been times

00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:04,720
where marta figured out a solution or

00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:06,399
vice versa and i think

00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:08,560
that sharing and exchanging of

00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:11,440
information just amongst us was uh

00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:11,440
was really helpful

00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:17,440
great uh thank you anisha and steph

00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:18,960
what would you say is uh your top item

00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,599
for uh contributing to this project

00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:22,720
success

00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:24,560
yeah so much of a tactic i think the

00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:26,320
content strategy docs and the

00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:29,200
information architecture docs

00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:30,560
really saved our lives because the

00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:33,040
content strategy docs

00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:33,760
first started off with what is the site

00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:35,520
goal

00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:37,359
who are your users and what are they

00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:39,040
trying to achieve and what are

00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:40,560
some of the user stories that we need to

00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:43,679
consider so as

00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:44,399
a blank i want to blank in order to do

00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:47,200
blank

00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:47,679
and so putting it in that mad blip style

00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:49,440
where

00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:50,800
the stakeholders could easily kind of

00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:54,079
fill in the blanks

00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:56,800
helped our team focus and zero in as we

00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:58,560
were rewriting all of the content

00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:00,640
and especially in the information

00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:03,760
architecture marta and nisha did a

00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:07,119
fabulous job in terms of really setting

00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:08,720
page goals at that level too so what is

00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:11,200
the goal for the home page what is the

00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:13,119
goal for this third level menu item that

00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:15,359
you know maybe not too many people will

00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:16,240
access but that page is still important

00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:18,480
for a particular

00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:19,839
set of users so identifying the page

00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:22,800
goal identifying

00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:23,200
the main call to actions on that page

00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:26,160
and

00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:26,800
also laying out content ideas okay we

00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:29,040
may not

00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:30,320
have this content right now but we can

00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:32,320
at least leave room

00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:34,079
and make space for it in the future so

00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:35,119
that when we come back around to those

00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:37,040
stakeholders

00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:39,440
that we'll be able to basically start

00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:40,079
with something instead of starting from

00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:43,359
scratch

00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:46,240
if that makes sense um and also

00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:47,440
our component library that definitely

00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:50,960
helps speed up

00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:53,359
the process and put everyone on the same

00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:54,560
level no matter if you were a builder if

00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:57,680
you were a writer

00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:59,839
um if you are analysts it allow you

00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:01,359
it allowed you to see okay well this how

00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:03,520
the doc this is how the content is

00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:06,560
formulated in the doc

00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:08,640
we use tables inside of google

00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:09,839
google docs in order to come up with a

00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:12,480
page layout

00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:14,560
so you can clearly see which content is

00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:16,480
columnized versus which content is just

00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:19,359
you know within the main body

00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:20,400
and those indicators from the component

00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:23,280
library

00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:25,440
helped you visually see okay well now i

00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:26,240
can see how this content is going to be

00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:28,720
transferred

00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:30,560
from the google doc and into a digital

00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:33,599
space because sometimes that

00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:34,960
is not so apparent some of us are visual

00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:37,440
learners and some of us can

00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:38,839
understand the theory but we all know

00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:41,040
like

00:36:38,839 --> 00:36:41,760
we've projects where something that

00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:44,079
we've done

00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:45,280
in google docs does not translate

00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:48,079
directly 100

00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:49,440
percent perfectly to the web especially

00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:51,839
you know when you're dealing with mobile

00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:52,560
devices and ipads and tablets and things

00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:54,880
like that

00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:56,560
so we were able to use those documents

00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:59,440
in order to speed up

00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:00,000
and if it didn't translate over that's

00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:02,079
okay

00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,160
because then you're just refining the

00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:06,240
content on the page rather than

00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:09,680
tearing it all down and rebuilding it

00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:11,440
from scratch

00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:13,520
thank you steph marta anything else that

00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:16,400
you want to add here

00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:17,200
there's a lot covered already um

00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,440
definitely the

00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:21,119
building trust and respect that's been

00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:22,000
talked about quite a bit so i don't want

00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:23,839
to take up too much

00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,720
time so we still have time for questions

00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:28,400
and answers uh but that was definitely a

00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:30,400
critical piece uh

00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:32,640
both within our ourselves our

00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:33,440
stakeholders and with stephanie and your

00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:37,839
team

00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:39,920
um i can't speak enough about it

00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:40,960
and that open communication as well

00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,960
thank you

00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:46,400
definitely agree on that one okay last

00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:48,400
one nation we can move to the last slide

00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:51,040
all right greatest lessons learned from

00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:55,200
this project steph would you like to

00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:58,240
start us off sure my greatest lesson

00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:59,680
learned is to always remain agile and be

00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:02,560
adaptable

00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:03,680
with a project of this sheer size things

00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:06,960
are going to change

00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:08,560
no matter how hard you try to plan it in

00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:12,560
the beginning you can't plan

00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:14,960
everything life is going to happen

00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:16,640
new projects are going to come in needs

00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:18,640
are going to shift

00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:20,640
depending on what time you work with

00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:24,640
your stakeholders or your clients

00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:28,000
um but really using the agile method

00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:29,920
we use sprints so every two weeks we

00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,079
set up settled upon the work that needs

00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:32,400
to get done so our team could focus and

00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:34,800
then

00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:36,240
at the end of that sprint we did a quick

00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:38,880
retrospective

00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:39,760
um within the team to basically give me

00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:42,240
another chance

00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:44,480
to listen to how everyone's feeling and

00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:46,400
those retrospectives you know consisted

00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:48,720
of you know what's happening in your

00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:51,359
personal lives versus the project

00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:53,920
so that we could remain agile and

00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:53,920
adaptable

00:38:54,079 --> 00:39:00,960
wonderful marta what about you

00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:04,240
yes uh for me part of it was uh

00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:05,839
just understanding and uh

00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:07,520
trusting the domain knowledge of

00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:09,200
stephanie and her team

00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:11,200
and the stakeholders as well that was

00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,599
really important for us maybe more on

00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:14,960
the

00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:18,880
uh success piece um

00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:21,280
and then the other piece was we did have

00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:23,200
uh on paper when we walked all of our

00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:25,680
stakeholders through was understanding

00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:27,040
for this particular page who is the main

00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:28,000
user is going to be coming in what is

00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:30,800
the main goal they're trying

00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:32,960
to accomplish on that page and that

00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:34,960
seems like a no-brainer but

00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:37,520
really to keep coming back to that

00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:39,280
question over and over it really helped

00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:41,119
the stakeholders stay focused and it

00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:44,000
helped us be able to get through

00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:44,800
the substantial mass amount of content

00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,640
and pages

00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:48,480
i mean some some sites were small but

00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:50,560
others had hundreds of pages so

00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:52,240
going through that for all the new

00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:53,520
information architecture for each one

00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:55,119
going and understanding

00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:57,040
who needs to access that what are they

00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:58,480
trying to get if the content's not

00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:59,599
helping them then maybe it doesn't need

00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,400
to be here maybe it needs to be

00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:02,560
somewhere else

00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:03,520
or it doesn't need to be here at all so

00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:07,119
um

00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:09,359
it was really a purifying experience but

00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:11,200
uh that was a one of the biggest things

00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:12,720
the other was being this flexibility in

00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:15,599
the tools and the templates

00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:17,119
and our process um adapting to what's

00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:18,079
working best right now or what works

00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:21,119
best for

00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:21,760
different stakeholders um and then one

00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:25,680
of the

00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:27,440
items we came in and started using was

00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:29,280
loom videos because we just didn't have

00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:32,000
the time to be setting up

00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:33,839
meetings uh with stephanie and her team

00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,200
to do the knowledge transfer of

00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:36,240
okay this is what we learned from the

00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,280
stakeholders and these are

00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:38,960
recommendations

00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:40,400
and this is what we're thinking what the

00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,880
information architecture should look

00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:43,680
like

00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:45,359
or the content strategy so we videotape

00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:46,880
ourselves walking through the screen you

00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:48,160
can see the mouse moving so

00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:50,000
you know exactly what we're talking

00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:52,000
about and giving it context so they

00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:54,319
could watch it at any time

00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,839
i guess one of the drawbacks of uh

00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:56,560
working from home is you could be

00:40:55,839 --> 00:40:57,920
working

00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:59,760
literally at any time middle of the

00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:01,920
night early mornings

00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:02,800
during the day so it just gave us that

00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:06,400
flexibility

00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:07,920
which is fantastic thank you marta

00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:09,760
and any last minute thoughts anisha from

00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:11,920
you before we hop over to the q a

00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:12,800
yeah i'll just fill us up with last

00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:14,960
thought was

00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:17,440
i thought that it was really valuable um

00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:20,800
when i was coming in as a new

00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:24,000
um project member um into this and

00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:25,920
reviewing the sites and actually note

00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,359
taking all of the assumptions that i was

00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:30,240
making along the way

00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:32,160
um as a new user looking at the

00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:33,359
stakeholders sites and content i felt

00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:35,839
like that

00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:37,599
perspective that view became really

00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:39,520
valuable in my conversations with the

00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:41,680
stakeholders especially if

00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:43,359
the overall layout or structure didn't

00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:44,400
you know initially make sense to me as

00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:46,720
that new user

00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:48,240
so i think i'm just always documenting

00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:49,920
those list of assumptions that we're

00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:51,599
making along the way as we're

00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:54,000
you know strategizing and coming up with

00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:56,400
those proposals um it was really

00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,400
valuable

00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:00,400
okay we'll just jump onto the next slide

00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:04,800
i want to close with a

00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:06,640
final quote uh from nelson mandela

00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:08,319
it always seems impossible until it's

00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:10,079
done and that's how some of us were

00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:12,079
feeling i'm sure at the beginning but

00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:13,280
uh you know as i mentioned earlier when

00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:14,480
we got right into it

00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:16,160
i knew we were going to get it done and

00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:17,440
we did manage to get it done right on

00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:19,119
time so

00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:20,640
i really want to extend my personal

00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:21,040
thanks to the team here in the extended

00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:22,720
team

00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:24,640
i know some of you are here with us that

00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:27,440
worked on this project it really was a

00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:29,920
huge success in my opinion

00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:31,760
we do have a lot coming in in the q a so

00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:34,400
i'm just going to hop over there

00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:35,520
and we have just under 10 minutes i've

00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:37,599
sorted by popular

00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:38,960
so forgive us if we can't get every

00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:39,920
question right now in the next few

00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:41,520
minutes but we will

00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:43,200
go through and make sure that they are

00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:45,760
all answered

00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:47,359
so i the top one right now that a lot of

00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:49,359
people are interested in is was there

00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:50,560
any pushback from the microsite owners

00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:52,640
or the stakeholders

00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:55,440
and how did you manage that who would

00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:58,880
like to answer that one

00:42:55,440 --> 00:43:00,720
you can start um yes there were pushback

00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:03,119
from some stakeholders

00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:04,800
that and we realized that those were the

00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:06,720
stakeholders that cared the most about

00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:09,440
their websites to be honest

00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:12,079
so they were very concerned about the

00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:15,760
website changing or switching over

00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:18,400
to a new platform and then also

00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:19,839
the ability of people being able to find

00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:22,400
that information

00:43:19,839 --> 00:43:23,839
so to be quite honest we just listened

00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:26,800
to their concerns

00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:27,200
we were we asked for blackout dates so

00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:29,920
okay

00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:30,319
well if we were to go live for on your

00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:32,640
site

00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:34,560
what dates can we black out because

00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:36,160
there's there are major milestones that

00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:40,319
are happening on your end

00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:43,359
and we documented and we negotiated

00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:44,319
we said okay well tell me the parts of

00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:47,040
your site

00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:48,800
that end users need to access very very

00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:52,319
quickly that you're worried about

00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:54,880
well we considered using added keywords

00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:56,720
to our search tool so we use swift type

00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:58,079
application in order to manage and power

00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:59,680
our website search

00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:01,520
we also asked how they were

00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:02,960
communicating directly through other

00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:05,599
platforms like email

00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:07,520
or social we found out a lot of these

00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:11,119
stakeholders that were a little nervous

00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:13,119
were already connecting very well

00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:14,240
on social media platforms and they're

00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:16,640
able to send

00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:18,319
users directly to the content so that's

00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:20,160
how we kind of mitigated we

00:44:18,319 --> 00:44:22,160
basically tried to understand their

00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:24,720
issues really understand

00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:26,000
what happens in their world and not just

00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:27,920
thinking about the website but

00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,400
considering all of their communication

00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:30,319
tools

00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:31,520
of how we can basically get people

00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:35,119
adjusted to the new

00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:36,400
architecture thank you steph and i'm

00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:39,040
taking some notes as well

00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:40,720
briefly uh as as you're answering the

00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:42,160
next most popular one here and it's

00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:43,599
going to be another one for you steph

00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:46,960
is what was the background of the

00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:49,839
trinity team two web dev and one manager

00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:51,920
question mark or something else yes so

00:44:49,839 --> 00:44:54,160
there are three full-time employees that

00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:55,200
are dedicated to the website within the

00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:58,240
marketing team

00:44:55,200 --> 00:45:00,319
myself as a director one web developer

00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:01,680
and one web support manager that

00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:03,839
basically oversees

00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:05,359
our ticketing system so not a lot of

00:45:03,839 --> 00:45:07,440
resources

00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:09,680
within the marketing team itself as a

00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:11,599
whole there are plethora of content

00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:14,319
writers and designers but

00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:15,359
they're mainly kind of print focus based

00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:17,680
and so

00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:19,760
the skill set of using web best

00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:21,280
practices and things were just very very

00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:24,079
new to the team

00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:25,599
because we were underneath a time crunch

00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:28,640
we made the decision to

00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:29,599
leverage imagex's expertise as much as

00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:32,800
we could

00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:36,000
and then also slowly through you know

00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:36,480
a lot of trial and error give other

00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,880
members

00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:40,000
of our team the opportunity in order to

00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:42,800
write content

00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,760
edit content design a graphic or an

00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:45,920
image

00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:47,760
but at a smaller scale so they didn't

00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:49,680
have to to stop what they were doing in

00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:51,599
their regular day-to-day jobs to come

00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:54,800
to completely be focused on this

00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:57,680
one-time thing that is a scary project

00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:58,319
so um and we were also able to leverage

00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:59,920
interns

00:45:58,319 --> 00:46:01,839
interns are your best friends if they're

00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:02,640
hungry and they're they're just wanting

00:46:01,839 --> 00:46:05,680
to work

00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:07,200
so a lot of those tedious tasks that

00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:09,119
you know would take a lot of time and

00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:11,760
effort to do they were fully

00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:13,280
excited to do and great quality

00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:16,480
assurance testers

00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:18,720
i mean um documenting everything

00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:20,480
in terms of well this content doesn't

00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:21,200
make sense and we had to guide them

00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:24,319
based on

00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:25,040
what they needed to focus on and also

00:46:24,319 --> 00:46:28,000
there were

00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:28,800
a couple of resources within our trinity

00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,280
team

00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:33,359
where we were able to help kind of

00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:35,359
bridge the gap between

00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:38,000
some writers that were doing writing for

00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:39,920
campaigns or other storytelling type

00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:42,560
and say hey this is kind of the same

00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:44,800
thing in terms of web

00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:47,359
let's see if how you do on this other

00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:47,760
side a web tried out and if it worked

00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:50,079
well

00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:51,200
we were able to give them more work and

00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:53,359
if it didn't we

00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:55,280
would say okay well who's another team

00:46:53,359 --> 00:46:57,920
member that we could plug and play

00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:59,680
or at least get it to 50 or 60 percent

00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:03,040
where they could help with a little bit

00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:04,640
but not take on the whole thing

00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:06,240
thanks stefan thanks for touching upon

00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:07,839
testing as well that was another popular

00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:09,920
question so there was the testing of the

00:47:07,839 --> 00:47:11,760
content strategy and even before that

00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:13,119
when we had finished up the the phase

00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:14,240
two of this project we've gone through

00:47:13,119 --> 00:47:16,800
quite an extensive

00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:18,480
quality assurance as well uh testing you

00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:20,000
know the back end and also the front end

00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:22,319
user experience and uh

00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:24,079
accessibility as well now another

00:47:22,319 --> 00:47:24,800
questions jumped up to the top as

00:47:24,079 --> 00:47:26,400
popular

00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:27,839
and staff are putting you on the spot

00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:30,400
again because it's

00:47:27,839 --> 00:47:31,599
uh relative to you and you're uh because

00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:33,280
you are the designer

00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:35,760
and and project manager and one of many

00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:38,400
talents but uh the question is

00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:39,920
did you use atomic design system pattern

00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:43,200
lab storybook

00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:46,000
storybook or others we researched it

00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:48,319
we weren't able to apply all of the

00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,920
atomic design principles because of the

00:47:48,319 --> 00:47:53,680
time span

00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:57,200
so we basically design components

00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:58,240
on certain use cases so if there was a

00:47:57,200 --> 00:48:01,040
use case where

00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:02,079
users needed to quickly see all of the

00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:04,559
options

00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:05,680
and access the cta in order to get to

00:48:04,559 --> 00:48:07,520
that content

00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:08,800
then we designed a component that would

00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:10,480
do that whether that be

00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:13,599
two columns or three columns or four

00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:16,400
columns it may have had you know a title

00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:18,480
a short description and a clear call to

00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:20,240
action and we maybe put a limit on that

00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:20,880
call to action so you wouldn't have like

00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:22,880
five or

00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:24,480
six buttons sitting on top of each other

00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:27,359
so there are aspects that we

00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:29,200
definitely read and understood um our

00:48:27,359 --> 00:48:30,480
for our next phase of the project we're

00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:33,920
actually focused on

00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:35,920
building out a web style guide based on

00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:39,440
everything that we have in the system

00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:39,839
so the figma component design library

00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:41,599
was

00:48:39,839 --> 00:48:43,839
just to get us through this next phase

00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:46,319
because we knew we had to

00:48:43,839 --> 00:48:47,920
help the builders help the writers and

00:48:46,319 --> 00:48:49,839
also help the people on the project kind

00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:51,200
of understand what the options are in

00:48:49,839 --> 00:48:53,440
the system at that time

00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:55,280
and so now we're taking a step back and

00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:56,640
actually going to kind of re-audit some

00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:58,880
of our components

00:48:56,640 --> 00:49:00,079
to see if we can start using some of

00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:02,000
those atomic design

00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:03,920
principles in terms of organizing

00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:06,240
content

00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:08,240
that it does kind of follow that true

00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:10,240
method

00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:11,839
all right thank you very much if we can

00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:14,720
squeeze in one last question in 30

00:49:11,839 --> 00:49:16,160
seconds and leave 30 to wrap up

00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:17,520
the and because this relates to the

00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:19,040
future and where we're going which is

00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:20,880
kind of nice way to end

00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:22,640
uh so the question is has the trinity

00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:23,520
team been trained to take over their new

00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:25,440
architecture

00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:26,960
theme and design system and are there

00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:29,280
any challenges with it

00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:31,200
so once again steph i'll call on you

00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:33,440
yeah not yet

00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:35,920
um since this is kind of new and shiny

00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:39,440
we're keeping our arms tight around this

00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:42,800
because we do have a lot of training and

00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:44,720
educating our campus to our new world

00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:46,480
previously we would just you know

00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:47,599
someone sends us content we copy and

00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:49,839
paste it on the web

00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:50,640
boom if it works and if it doesn't oh

00:49:49,839 --> 00:49:53,119
boy

00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:54,640
um so now we know we it needs to fall

00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:57,359
within the content strategy

00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:58,319
so right now we're focused on

00:49:57,359 --> 00:50:00,160
redesigning

00:49:58,319 --> 00:50:01,440
our intake system in the project

00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:04,800
management to

00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:06,960
in order to really dive deeper into

00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:08,880
okay well if this person is asking for

00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:10,880
this this one thing and then another

00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:12,400
person is asking for something similar

00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:14,720
and 10 other people are asking for the

00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:16,960
same thing could this actually be a

00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:19,040
project that we can transparently say

00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:20,559
to the campus that this is what our team

00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:22,559
is doing um

00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:24,319
as far as opening it back up to the

00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:28,400
campus i'm actually

00:50:24,319 --> 00:50:31,760
in conversations about trying to get web

00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:32,720
into some job descriptions our content

00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:35,440
editors

00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:36,880
range from you know admin assistants to

00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:39,440
faculty members

00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:40,559
to dedicated communications people in

00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:43,119
the department

00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:44,240
and so it's really hard to basically

00:50:43,119 --> 00:50:46,400
open the site back

00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:47,359
up and try to change those people

00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:49,920
because they also

00:50:47,359 --> 00:50:50,960
change over time and so we're doing some

00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:53,280
web governance

00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:54,319
first in order to figure out okay now

00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:56,480
that we've

00:50:54,319 --> 00:50:57,760
completed the second phase how do we

00:50:56,480 --> 00:51:00,720
continue to govern

00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:02,559
but also still service the campus and

00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:03,440
looking at different types of approaches

00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:07,119
whether that be

00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:09,200
top down middle out or bottom up

00:51:07,119 --> 00:51:11,200
fantastic and just to wrap it up i want

00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:13,760
to say thank you very much

00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:15,520
uh to the panel for your participation

00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:16,720
and i'd encourage you to check out the q

00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:18,160
a i've been answering as much as
