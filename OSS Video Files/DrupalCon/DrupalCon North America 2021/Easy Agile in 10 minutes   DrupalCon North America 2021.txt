00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,719
okay everyone welcome to today's

00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:16,320
lightning session

00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:18,560
so we will be talking about easy agile

00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,160
and how you can get started with agile

00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,279
pretty much not even in 10 minutes i

00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,960
want to say five minutes

00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:24,320
um so i'll be sharing my screen and

00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,119
you'll be able to see

00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:29,519
more about how to run an agile workflow

00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:32,399
really easily with tara ai

00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:34,079
so just for context i'm ivan masoud i am

00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:37,520
the co-founder and ceo

00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:39,520
at tara ai and um we

00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,200
will actually be responding to questions

00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,680
as well on our twitter

00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,399
so in chat we're going to quickly post a

00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,000
link to

00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,239
our twitter profile so if you have any

00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,079
questions as we go

00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:51,680
feel free to post um and share those

00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:53,120
questions in chat or

00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,039
you can also post those questions on

00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:57,199
twitter and we can respond to them

00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:58,320
after our lightning round and our

00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:01,840
lightning session is

00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:04,640
up okay so let's get started um so

00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,519
i'll just give a quick intro to um to

00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:09,280
who we are

00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:12,080
and uh why we exist um so tara ai

00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,799
is a y combinator backed startup we

00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:16,479
actually built

00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:18,479
a really fast modern jira alternative

00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:20,640
and so we thought what if you could do

00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:22,799
and run agile in a couple of minutes

00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,200
in just a few clicks and so that's

00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:27,680
really the premise behind tara and so

00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,600
uh just to get started um basically

00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,600
there's really three key concepts

00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,439
in tara one is requirements and

00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,920
requirements management so you can

00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:36,799
easily create and define a requirement

00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:40,000
so imagine

00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:42,000
that i am a founder going through

00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,840
y combinator or an accelerator and i

00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,640
need to get my mvp

00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,759
uh off the graph so what i would do is i

00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,840
can create

00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:52,000
a requirement um so let's say i'm trying

00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:55,520
to create an ios

00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,200
mobile app uh there we go

00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,360
and from there i can just start writing

00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,320
the specs so i can let's say decide on

00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,640
the framework

00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,680
um that i want to use uh programming

00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,159
language

00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,960
and um and let's say that i've decided

00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:10,239
to use

00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:12,560
uh swished uh to build this uh but

00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:15,120
as i'm defining some of the um

00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,840
objectives uh for my requirement as well

00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,280
as

00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,599
um what really i'm trying to accomplish

00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,040
with web one of the app

00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:22,959
the next piece is i can also start

00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,640
adding tasks and what's really cool

00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:26,480
about this is and by the way this is a

00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,920
live version of tara this is really how

00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,599
fast it actually is

00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,840
it's pretty much in seconds that you can

00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:32,800
get started but um but the idea behind

00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,879
this was

00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:37,040
versus going through confluence jira and

00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:38,080
all you know all of the complexities of

00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,920
existing uh

00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,680
tools we wanted to build something that

00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,879
was quick and fast that you can really

00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,560
get started with agile

00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:46,000
pretty much in minutes so imagine that

00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,760
i'm building this mobile app i can

00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,200
actually start creating tasks as well so

00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,720
if i'm a developer

00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,040
let's say the product manager or the

00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,560
engineering manager has created the spec

00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,319
and if i'm a developer and i just want

00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:59,360
to start creating all the issues

00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:01,599
um or the tasks related to this first

00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:04,159
first version what i can do is pretty

00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:07,280
much just start typing away uh so

00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:08,800
let's say that um let's say that this is

00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:12,080
you know an enhancement uh

00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:14,480
to what's being built and i'm looking to

00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,599
uh build front end of course just for

00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,239
simplicity's sake

00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:19,920
but right there um it's ready to go i

00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:22,480
can assign it to myself

00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,680
allocate the effort as well um and so

00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,720
efforts available in days

00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,440
hours um and i can get started with

00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,640
sprints

00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:32,000
so we'll talk a little bit more about

00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:34,159
what sprints um help you do in tara but

00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,120
really easy and simple you can basically

00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:38,239
allocate it to

00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:40,319
a specific sprint um and and so

00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:41,440
right now um that's my current sprint

00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:43,360
that's active

00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,720
and uh and then you know i have the

00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,799
requirement already in there

00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,840
but here's what's really cool as a

00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,959
developer

00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:53,519
if i use the task id in github or

00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:54,799
in my existing source control

00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:56,879
application

00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:58,080
what it does is that it automatically

00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:01,200
shows um

00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,159
the specific status of the pull requests

00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,200
or the commit

00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:07,120
so um as a team let's say that you know

00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,319
um i'm someone that's just trying to

00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,480
stay in github

00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:11,599
i don't want to keep updating the status

00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,439
of the task

00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:15,680
inside my the project management

00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:16,720
application what happens is when you use

00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,639
your task id

00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,000
it will automatically update the status

00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:22,639
of the task um

00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,080
inside um inside tara so um so that's

00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:27,600
kind of one of the magic features

00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:29,840
uh that 26 000 developers on tara love

00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,639
now let's uh head back into our

00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,840
requirement

00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:34,560
and start sprinting so with sprints

00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,880
we've created

00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:39,040
one click sprints um all you're really

00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,680
doing is creating bi-weekly or weekly

00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,120
sprints

00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,040
we are introducing four-week and six

00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,680
week sprints as well for the next couple

00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,440
of weeks

00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,199
but here's what's really cool um as soon

00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,880
as you get started um you pretty much

00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:51,600
have your sprint ready to go

00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,240
um and uh and then from there um so

00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,080
let's say

00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,840
i've decided to complete the sprint oh

00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,639
i've got the poop emoji because i didn't

00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:59,919
actually

00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:01,120
um complete any of the tasks but um but

00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:01,840
let's say that you know i'm kind of

00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,199
ready to go

00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:06,720
and i want the sprint completed um

00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:09,280
so what it does is that'll complete the

00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:12,479
sprint and i can start the next one

00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:15,199
now um let's you know um let's assume

00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:16,400
that from here um i've started the

00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:18,240
sprint

00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,160
and and there we go i'm actually going

00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,400
to start seeing my recommended effort

00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,000
as well so within the sprint what it

00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,720
actually does so tara is built to be

00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,440
intelligent

00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,720
hence the ai name and so the idea here

00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,440
is that it'll actually start

00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:33,520
calculating your a recommended effort

00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:35,919
for this current sprint to look at your

00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,800
past sprints and your past history as a

00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:38,880
team

00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,080
what your team is typically

00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,639
accomplishing

00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:44,639
in um in a sprint and based on that

00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:46,560
information it will start recommending

00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:47,759
what your recommended effort uh should

00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,479
be um

00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:51,360
and and so uh let's say that my sprint

00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:53,120
has started

00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,600
and so from there i want to start

00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,280
looking and under understanding progress

00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,440
now of course i can also create multiple

00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,240
different teams in the software so let's

00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:03,759
say we are

00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:06,639
split up into multiple pods um or agile

00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,120
uh agile teams uh one other piece is

00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:09,440
that

00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,560
uh the software is basically built so

00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:13,360
that you can very

00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:15,360
quickly and easily create these pods

00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,479
that are working together to build uh to

00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,360
build the app

00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:20,720
uh from there um let's say that you know

00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,199
we've gotten uh

00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,240
we've gotten kicked off and are running

00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:25,759
what i'm actually going to do is i'm

00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,800
going to show you the progress bar

00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:29,600
uh for our uh workspace because this is

00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,840
where we live

00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,360
um this is what we do every day and this

00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,039
is what we use for our daily stand up as

00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:38,160
well so let's say now

00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:38,800
we are a large team that is consistently

00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,560
shipping

00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:44,720
and is um seeing lots of progress

00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,479
what tara helps you do is in one view

00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:49,039
you can also start to see predicted

00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:50,479
effort on the left how effort is running

00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:52,960
and going in terms of

00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:54,639
by um engineer and and by developer and

00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,560
by every person on the team

00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:57,840
and um and then the other thing is you

00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,400
can also see of course

00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,880
um seven levels so sub levels in terms

00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,360
of

00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,080
um specific step levels assigned to a

00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,199
given bug

00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:09,039
or an issue but the other cool thing is

00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:10,639
that i can see the status

00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:13,039
and what's actually happening from a

00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:16,000
status perspective inside github

00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:16,720
so this is really showing me merged stat

00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,560
status

00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,919
and what that means is the task is

00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,560
actually automatically marked as

00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:22,880
complete

00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,479
so once the pr is merged and once the

00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:27,599
pull request is merged

00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:30,880
inside github the application

00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:32,639
automatically moves to birch

00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,400
and and so it actually shows me let's

00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:36,720
say i'm an engineering manager and

00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,400
i want to understand status on an

00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,960
ongoing basis

00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,919
during the sprint um when i log into

00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:45,360
tara and i see

00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:46,560
the progress uh view what's really cool

00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:50,319
is i can start to see

00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:53,039
um the status that's also inside git

00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:55,680
the other piece is um you can also view

00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:58,400
commits and prs so let's say that

00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:01,120
you're a group of three developers and

00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:04,240
github's view can be pretty um difficult

00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:06,560
to really understand commits and open

00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,680
pull requests in a given sprint boundary

00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,160
so let's say you're working on a

00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,840
two-week sprint or a weekly sprint

00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:14,240
so what we've done here is you can

00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,800
easily view the commits that are taking

00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,440
place

00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:19,440
and and so what you're seeing is um what

00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,840
are the most recent commits happening

00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,560
from the team uh the other thing that's

00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:25,199
really cool

00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:27,599
is you can also view uh open pull

00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:29,680
requests so what are the open prs

00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:31,759
um that need attention and that need

00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,519
closing uh within the sprint

00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:35,279
um and then you know of course um you

00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:36,240
can also see if there's any kind of

00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:38,560
pending uh

00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,279
pending reviewers um and you can also

00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:42,399
click in

00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:46,560
to see the actual pull request inside

00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:48,480
github so um yeah we are uh almost um

00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,920
two minutes ahead on the dot um now we

00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,560
can talk a little bit about

00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:54,160
um integrations so one of the other

00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,760
things that we believe makes agile

00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,120
software powerful is you need to be able

00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,560
to use it with your communication

00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,279
software and so

00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:03,279
once you've connected tara to slack it

00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:04,080
will automatically push notifications

00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:06,720
into slack

00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:08,720
and also reporting into slack so in

00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,240
terms of reporting really understanding

00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,640
from a high-level perspective

00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,519
what was completed in the sprint overall

00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:17,519
effort

00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:18,240
tasks and um and just um prs and commits

00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,399
as well

00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,279
you'll actually get automatic reports um

00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:24,480
inside

00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:27,120
uh slack for um specifically

00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,760
for what's happening in your sprint so

00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,839
um

00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,440
the other piece is focus state so our

00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:33,120
home is actually focus state

00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,200
and what this does is so we're a group

00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,880
of developers tara is designed by

00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,800
developers and built for developers

00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:40,160
and the idea here was that in focus

00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,399
state you can actually see

00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,920
the tasks that are assigned to you and

00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:46,080
um so i don't have any tasks assigned to

00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,839
me in this specific workspace but

00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,760
what i can see is you know just overall

00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:53,200
how the team is is

00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:55,200
progressing um within the actual sprint

00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,800
and i can also see pull requests that

00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:00,240
are assigned to me

00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,880
and are created by me that require my

00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,560
attention

00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:04,000
so what's great here is that i can see a

00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:07,920
quick view of

00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:11,120
the prs and that brings us to

00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:14,480
the end of just going to stop sharing

00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:16,560
there we go so that brings us to the end

00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,680
of the session so here's a special

00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:20,880

00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:21,519
