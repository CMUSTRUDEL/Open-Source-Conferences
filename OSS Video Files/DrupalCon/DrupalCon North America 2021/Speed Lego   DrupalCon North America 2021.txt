00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,240
15. let's do it yes so here's here's the

00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:07,839
setup i'm gonna

00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,280
i'm gonna get this started here all

00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:12,480
right so here's

00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:13,679
here's what i'm doing here is my low

00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,400
fidelity

00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,760
uh uh there we go low fidelity drupalcon

00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,199
thing that i'm looking at i'm not just

00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,000
going to recreate this i want to do

00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,160
something

00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,439
a bit more fully featured this is what

00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,439
i've given myself

00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:26,800
i went through my collection and pulled

00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:27,920
out some pieces that i thought might be

00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,920
appropriate

00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,279
um and i'm just gonna have to do it from

00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:34,640
here so

00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:38,559
i'm ready whenever you are psy let's

00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:41,760
let's count me down let's do this three

00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:43,200
two one okay start i'm gonna

00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,559
great i'm gonna talk through the the

00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,520
process a little bit i'm thinking about

00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:47,520
the little like the

00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,120
the sort of the curly part of the the

00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,719
drop so that's where i'm going to start

00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:53,440
that's my strategy

00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:55,039
all right here we are we're doing this

00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,399
now

00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:59,199
all right i'm going to give you a warm

00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:00,719
up question okay what is the plural of

00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:04,320
lego

00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:09,360
uh legos no the plural of lego

00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:12,320
is lego it doesn't matter

00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,640
a hundred pieces of lego it's still lego

00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,400
uh

00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,400
although most most people do call them

00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,720
legos

00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:21,680
okay yeah well there's a debate right

00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,119
like i growing up i just called it legos

00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,799
uh and then there are all these people

00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:26,880
who say no it's lego it's like

00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:28,640
it's a it's a concept not a not a

00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:32,000
collection of bricks

00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:35,520
um yeah okay all right

00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,400
yes here we go okay back in the zone

00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,439
okay lego comes from the danish word leg

00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,880
goat

00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:43,840
i think i'm pronouncing that right what

00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:45,340
does that mean in english

00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,609
um

00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:48,609
[Music]

00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:55,680
build i'm just gonna guess build no

00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,840
it means play well oh um

00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,759
and it's also a play-off of the first

00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,040
two letters of each of those danish

00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:04,640
words

00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:07,119
l-e-g-o okay okay

00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,680
oh that's cool you're at a minute and a

00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:10,720
half

00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,000
oh no okay um so i'm working on i'm

00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,120
trying to i'm doing the top part of the

00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,720
drop here i'm trying to

00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:18,959
get like a nice kind of flow

00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,840
uh going that's that's the that's the

00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:23,840
strategy i want to do sort of a circular

00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,840
shape

00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:31,200
what was the original name of lego

00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:40,160
i don't have a clue i don't have a clue

00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:42,319
what is it very literal name automatic

00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:45,920
binding bricks

00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:45,920
of course of course

00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:50,879
okay that looks okay i think that's okay

00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,480
it's looking good so far you're at too

00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:55,920
many little switches

00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:58,080
okay too much pressure um

00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,040
where are those other pieces this is

00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,879
like the

00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,159
uh this is the worst part it's like it's

00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:05,120
like half puzzle

00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:06,800
half building brick you're like looking

00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,239
for that one particular kind of piece i

00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,519
think this is that's yeah that's the

00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:10,959
thing i want to do here

00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:13,040
that's what i want to do i think that's

00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:14,239
perfect back on the track okay back on

00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,360
track here we go

00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:17,599
let's make this happen all right i got a

00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:20,640
couple of mini-fig questions for you

00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:23,680
each okay lego minifigure is exactly

00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:26,799
this many bricks high without a hat

00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,260
oh that's a good one without a hat

00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:30,080
without a hat

00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:31,599
[Music]

00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,840
it's gonna be either four or five so i'm

00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:34,799
gonna have to commit uh i'm gonna go

00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:39,680
with

00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:39,680
four you're right all right

00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,200
all right how many mini-figs have been

00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:47,840
made

00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,840
since the first one arrived in 1978

00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:53,440
i mean millions i'm sure uh

00:03:54,720 --> 00:04:02,000
10 million 10 million no you're way off

00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:04,560
more than four billion have been made

00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,799
what so if they were alive this would be

00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,680
the world's largest population group

00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:11,599
uh by threefold

00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:14,959
[Laughter]

00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:15,519
okay that's cool it's a little scary

00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:17,440
that's cool

00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:19,120
yeah yeah you're almost at halftime

00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:22,160
you're at about uh three

00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:26,000
minutes 40 seconds okay

00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:29,040
what does the acronym a-f-o-l stand for

00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,040
and you are

00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,320
and i'm one of them

00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:49,759
fan um something life

00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:52,720
a fan uh i don't know

00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:54,800
and like uh like an adult uh i'm i'm a

00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:58,240
nerdy adult who plays with legos

00:04:54,800 --> 00:05:01,600
adult fans of lego oh there we go

00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,720
there we go all right just over the four

00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,800
minute mark

00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,800
okay okay uh so i think i've got i think

00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,120
i've got the top part for the most part

00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,280
uh

00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,440
now i'm gonna work on the i'm just going

00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:13,280
to fill out the the body here

00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:15,680
real quick all right making progress

00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:18,160
look at that super fast

00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,960
all right the tallest lego tower ever

00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:22,800
built

00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:23,600
was 114 feet high how many bricks did it

00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,880
use

00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:29,199
114 feet high 114 feet high

00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,199
um

00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:37,039
[Music]

00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:39,919
like 5 million uh 550 000

00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:41,039
what okay i don't i need to i have no

00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:43,840
scale

00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:45,120
none whatsoever none whatsoever okay

00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,520
let's see about this one

00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:51,120
which lego minifig was the first to

00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:54,160
require a specially molded head

00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:56,800
oh especially multitask um here's what

00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,919
i don't i don't like this this little

00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,919
that looks a little too uh

00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:01,520
uh rigid so i'm gonna i'm gonna smooth

00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:06,080
that out a little bit here okay

00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:07,919
um okay specially molded head

00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,360
uh it's probably gonna be like a star

00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:12,560
wars character because those are

00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:16,160
that seems to be is it okay yes it is

00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,160
all right it's jar jar binks

00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:21,840
of course right of course it always

00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,800
feels like cheating a little bit like as

00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,160
much as i love like

00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,160
like when they do all the really special

00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,440
pieces like where they it just feels

00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,919
like they're kind of cheating into the

00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,919
shape

00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:33,840
you know that's right i agree

00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:35,199
okay we're closing in on six minutes

00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,680
todd oh shoot

00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:38,720
okay okay uh let's do this this is

00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,600
doable

00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,560
this is doable okay we're starting

00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:46,840
another one

00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:48,400
in the bottom of the of the drop at this

00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:52,160
point okay

00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:54,400
we'll just keep going on that um

00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,880
yeah hit me what's what's what's next

00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:59,120
all right let's talk quality control

00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,479
out of every million lego pieces

00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,960
produced how many

00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:04,400
fail to meet company standards out of

00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,639
every million

00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:08,960
like produce like the go like that are

00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:08,960
sold

00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,360
that go through the the factory process

00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:16,400
of being created

00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:20,000
oh no uh i am i imagine it's

00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:21,919
probably very few so like less than one

00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,919
percent

00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:29,199
yes oh hey

00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:31,199
quality control are so

00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:33,280
well engineered they're just like

00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,919
incredibly like they they fit tightly

00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,160
together

00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:36,960
they're all and if anybody's ever

00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,160
stepped on them you know they're

00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,680
indestructible

00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,759
yes that's right i've got a question

00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:44,319
about that to end okay and so

00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:46,400
here's here's the shape but i'm not

00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:49,039
happy until we have the eyes

00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,919
so okay we've got uh we're just at seven

00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:51,680
minutes right now

00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:54,080
okay all right uh where the eyes gonna

00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:57,360
go they're gonna go right about here

00:07:54,080 --> 00:08:00,560
so i'll have to take this

00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:03,759
out um

00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:08,479
okay is that going to be about right

00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:11,759
uh the answer to the quality control

00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:12,720
uh question by the way was 18 out of 1

00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:17,039
million pieces

00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:19,280
whoa that's impressive way to go

00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:21,199
yes all right i've got a couple a couple

00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:24,479
more

00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:27,280
okay lego sells more of this item

00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:28,879
than any other company annually what is

00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:32,000
this item
