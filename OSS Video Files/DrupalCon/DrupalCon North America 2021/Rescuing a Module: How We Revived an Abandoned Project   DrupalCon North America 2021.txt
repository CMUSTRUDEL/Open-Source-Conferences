all right we're gonna go ahead and get

00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:07,279
started

00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:08,160
hello everybody thanks for joining our

00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:10,639
session today

00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:12,000
on rescuing the module how we revived an

00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:14,080
abandoned project

00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,440
we're really excited to be here today

00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,920
and really honored that the drupal

00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:20,080
community has selected us to speak

00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,439
we're excited to share our experiences

00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,760
with rescuing a module

00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:25,599
and getting active in the community

00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,560
before we get started today we have a

00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:28,320
couple questions

00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,080
in the polls tab if you wouldn't mind

00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,920
answering them

00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,920
we have set aside some time at the end

00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,239
of our presentation for discussion but

00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,079
feel free to post any questions to the q

00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:39,680
a tab as we go along

00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:41,840
and we'll look through and answer them

00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,200
at the end

00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,360
in our session today we're going to

00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,440
cover identifying when projects could

00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,640
benefit from your involvement

00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:53,120
reviving interest in a stagnant project

00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,440
leveraging the community developing a

00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,640
plan for moving the project forward

00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,039
and we'll discuss different

00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,719
opportunities for contribution

00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:02,960
hopefully we'll encourage you to find

00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:06,960
your own module like tb mega menu

00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,960
and develop your own contribution story

00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,920
i'm irene dobbs and my pronouns are she

has been there for almost five years

00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,840
and been a drupaler for over ten he

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,400
started with bounties at our chicago

denver area

00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,439
for most of his career he's been a

00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,119
front-end developer though over the past

00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:38,720
few years he has been doing more

00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:41,360
back-end full-stack work he is tv mega

00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,479
menus maintainer and tb is his first

00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,880
major contribution

00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:47,040

she's been working as a drupal front-end

00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:03,600
developer at bounious for

00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:05,439
a year and a half she also started at

00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,920
our chicago office and funny enough is

00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:09,520
about to move to our denver office here

00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,000
fairly shortly

00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,520
she's also a co-maintainer on tb and has

00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,599
been responsible for the amazing

00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,440
documentation on the module

00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:18,640
you can find her on twitter at the

00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,200

underscore dobbs

00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:27,200
now that we've introduced ourselves we'd

00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,280
like to say a few words about the

00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,720
company that we're representing today

00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,720
as we mentioned we both work for

00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:35,040
bounties which is a technology-driven

00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,720
full-service digital consultancy

00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,200
and drupal is one of the big things that

00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,959
we do there we get to work on some

00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,959
really we get to work with some really

00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,640
smart and talented people

00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,000
in both our drupal practice and our

00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,920
company as a whole

00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
we're often hiring so if you're looking

00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,680
to do some really cool things or looking

00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,800
for a team to do some great work for

00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,120
your company

00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,120
please reach out uh bountis is a gold

00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,560
sponsor here at drupalcon north america

00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,720
and we have a virtual booth

00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,400
and as you may already know or will at

00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,400
least find out shortly

00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,400
bounties is passionate about drupal and

00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,319
contributing to the drupal community

00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,760
we also love rescues whether it be

00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:12,000
rescuing modules or

00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:14,080
rescuing animals we want to give back to

00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,920
both of these causes and you can help us

00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,599
for every attendee that visits our booth

00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,599
and chats with us

00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:21,280
we'll donate five dollars to regional

00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:23,120
animal rescues that are local to our

00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,200
bounty's collaboration centers

00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,760
as well as five dollars to the drupal

00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,280
association to continue support for open

00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,280
source technology

00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,519
both irene and myself will actually be

00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,799
at the bounties booth after the session

00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:36,480
like we mentioned we'll answer some

00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:38,000
questions at the end of this but we'll

00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,360
also be available at the booth if

00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,840
anybody wants to move over there

00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,840
afterwards

00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:47,360
so for those that are maybe not familiar

00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,879
with tv or as we like to call it the

00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,640
better mega menu

00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:52,640
it's a module that allows you to build

00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,680
rich and complex mega menus where each

00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,799
parent drop down

00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:58,959
can have a unique and custom layout

00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:00,319
you can you can create separate menu

00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:03,519
items into columns

00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:05,599
and control how each child level renders

00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:08,159
add custom classes at various levels and

00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:10,080
render blocks within drop downs

00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:12,159
it accomplishes all this through an easy

00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,920
to use admin ui

00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:16,239
it has full accessibility features on

00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:19,199
the front end and compatible with d7

00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:21,120
8 and 9. we also have thorough

00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:24,560
documentation covering d7

00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:27,120
8 and 9. tb was started in 2013

00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,960
we didn't discover it until 2017 as an

00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,360
unsupported project and eventually took

00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:33,840
over as maintainers last summer

00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,680
ultimately our experiences from 2017 to

00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,120
now made us feel like this is a story

00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,240
that we could share particularly because

00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,320
of how important

00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:43,840
open source and contribution is to this

00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,840
wonderful community

00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:48,720
so what is open source and why is

00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:51,040
contribution important

00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:53,520
well open source is built on principles

00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:55,600
like collaboration and community

00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,600
in a drupal's case means that anyone can

00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,440
use and share the code base

00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,800
contribution is all about helping

00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:03,840
something to advance

00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:05,360
in our case helping drupal a common way

00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:08,639
we all help drupal advance

00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:10,720
is by contributing new modules or themes

00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:12,479
helping with thriving ones or even in

00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,320
other non-code related ways like

00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:15,919
documentation

00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,600
i imagine that at least some of you

00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:18,400
listening have leveraged a community

00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,320
module

00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,880
and probably just relied on someone else

00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,639
stepping in and taking ownership

00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,639
but this is part of why we have open

00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:27,440
source to benefit from the community's

00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:29,840
work

00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,360
however contribution helps you get to

00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,800
the next level of open source

00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,199
participation

00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,720
and it has the plus of helping drupal

00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:38,880
move forward

00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:41,039
it is also a great way to collaborate

00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:44,160
with others in the drupal community

00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:46,720
learn something new advance a skill and

00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,560
even bring your own ideas to life

00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,160
all of this helps to pay back an

00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,479
advanced drupal

00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,840
contribution is vital to us keeping the

00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:56,319
system alive

00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,840
given that drupal has over 45 000

00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:59,440
modules available

00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,520
contributions have been critical to

00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:04,160
keeping this open source community

00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,160
advancing

00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,960
so what happens when a module used by

00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,080
over 30

00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:14,720
000 websites stops being supported

00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:16,319
you probably panic or at least get a

00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,160
little bit frustrated with the modules

00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,919
lack of movement right

00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,479
you're relying on that module for your

00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:24,720
project and now it's not being supported

00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:27,759
and that can be a scary feeling and this

00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:32,160
is also a common thing in open source

00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:33,919
so now you need to take a deep breath

00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,639
and help to bring that module back to

00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:39,759
life and that's what we did for the tb

00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:39,759
mega menu module

00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:45,039
we identified a four-step process that

00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:48,400
takes you from panic

00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:51,759
to contribution to bettering drupal

00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:54,720
the four steps we use are to identify

00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:56,560
revive leverage the community and to

00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,560
continue moving forward

00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,479
so to help explain what these steps look

00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,000
like we'll go into further details and

00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:04,319
give some examples of how

00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,639
we use these steps to bring tb back to

00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:06,639
life

00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,800
so how do you identify a module to

00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,240
rescue

00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,639
well there are a lot of ways i mean

00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,560
drupal or dot org has resources to help

00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:20,960
you look for modules that have requested

00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,880
new owners maintainers etc

00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,960
but what about the unsupported ones that

00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:28,160
are just sort of fading away

00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,160
that's a bit harder right

00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,599
for one you can start with your own

00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,440
module toolbox

00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:34,880
we all have them whether we realize it

00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,880
or not there's that group of contrib

00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:39,520
modules that we nearly always include on

00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:41,199
a project they are essential to us

00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,880
and occasionally with contrib modules

00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:44,879
for one reason or another

00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:47,120
we may encounter issues that have us

00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:48,960
turn to the project's issue queue

00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:51,599
and this can be a big clue as to whether

00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:53,360
maybe a module needs help or not

00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:54,800
does it mention on the project page that

00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,319
is looking for help

00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,919
are there a lot of issues in the queue

00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:59,520
particularly ones that seem to go

00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:01,280
unnoticed or maybe stuck

00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,639
and reviewed and tested by the community

00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,000
status

00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:06,240
are there enhancements you'd like to

00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,360
make if you could or noticed bugs

00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,240
and possibly even fix them already is

00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,199
the modules

00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:15,120
community still active in any way so as

00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:17,520
i mentioned we discovered tb when we

00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,280
discovered it by accident in 2017 while

00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,160
doing an audit for our prospective

00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,160
client

00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,680
we felt this module had some potential

00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,560
but we didn't really have a use for it

00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,560
right away

00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,919
but as a lot of us do when we find new

00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,680
and interesting modules

00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:32,320
we put it in our back pocket for

00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:34,800
possible usage in the future

00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:36,399
so then fast forward a year later we

00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,959
received a request from one of our

00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:39,039
clients

00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:40,159
wilson sporting goods to rebuild their

00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:42,479
mega menu

00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:43,599
and based on what they were looking for

00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:45,120
we remember tb

00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:47,120
and immediately realized it would be a

00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,880
nearly perfect fit

00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:51,040
so first and foremost though it wasn't

00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,959
accessible and there were a few

00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,240
things that we needed to address on our

00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:56,959
end to make it work

00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:59,120
mostly theme wise we put a lot of time

00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:01,040
and effort into this and gave wilson a

00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,720
pretty amazing menu that is still in

00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,640
place today

00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,080
but at this point i want to take a

00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,760
little bit of a tangent here

00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,680
this is a point where i feel a little

00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,640
personally feel personally a little

00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,800
guilty

00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,480
we did a lot of custom work on tv for

00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,800
wilson and even other

00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,399
projects after that but it wasn't

00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,160
something that i immediately thought of

00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:22,320
as a way to contribute back

00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,760
so fast forward a year i'm working with

00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,320
joseph purcell

00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:28,160
some of you here may or may not know him

00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,839
i was working with joe on a project and

00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:32,160
i was writing patches

00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:33,600
for tb to address some accessibility and

00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,440
some other issues

00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,680
even with additional modules unrelated

00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:40,000
to tv the thing is i was writing these

00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:42,000
patches for our local repo i was not

00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,600
writing these to contribute back to

00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,279
drupal

00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,480
so he brought this to my attention that

00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:48,320
like hey these things should be

00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,760
contributed back to the community he

00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,279
highly encouraged me to take this

00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:54,160
approach whenever possible and that's

00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:56,320
something i really appreciate him for

00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:58,399
so as we use this module more and more

00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:01,839
over the past four years

00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:04,640
or so we were in more of more

00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:05,120
in more of a mindset to fix and enhance

00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,519
it

00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,160
but notice that d8 was still only in

00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:10,800
development

00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:12,480
and d7 only had a release candidate it

00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,079
was five years old

00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,440
there were even several issues that had

00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:17,040
been reviewed and tested by the

00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,800
community in addition to

00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,320
our own that we had posted that just

00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,600
were not being moved forward

00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,519
we're just stuck in that kind of

00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,800
purgatory status that we're

00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:27,600
if you're familiar with any

00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:29,200
contributions you know very well

00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,120
we finally decided that due to how

00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:34,959
important this module was to us though

00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,959
that we wanted to do something about it

00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,360
so that brings us to trying to revive a

00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,519
project

00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,720
so we've identified our module that we'd

00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:45,440
like to rescue but

00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,079
how do you revive it to me identifying

00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,560
the module

00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:49,200
was the easy part doing something about

00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:52,000
it that's

00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:54,000
tougher it can be overwhelming for sure

00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,959
it certainly was for me before i got

00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,480
into this

00:10:54,959 --> 00:11:00,399
but it doesn't have to be so one of the

00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,760
first steps i think is to determine your

00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:03,760
role in a project

00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:05,760
are you just looking to help out maybe

00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,880
be more than a casual contributor in the

00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,959
issue queue

00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:10,079
what about having a bigger say in the

00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:11,920
project's direction

00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:13,839
having more control over what gets

00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,760
committed et

00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:18,079
are you looking to take the lead on the

00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,519
module once you determine your role and

00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:22,320
maybe sometimes these choices will be

00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:24,480
limited say if a module owner is just

00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,240
looking for a little bit of help or if a

00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,320
module has been completely abandoned but

00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,399
i guess in the context of our talk today

00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,000
we are looking at this more of the from

00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:35,519
the perspective of

00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,920
taking over as an owner or maintainer

00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:39,440
so next you should outline a plan now

00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,880
this doesn't need to contain every

00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,959
finite detail of

00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,720
what you want to do but it should least

00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:46,160
be a loose roadmap for once someone

00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,079
hands you the keys you know what you're

00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,519
going to do

00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:51,360
and we believe that these things in

00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:53,200
place will not only help you convince

00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,040
others to let you take over but will

00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:57,120
also eventually encourage users to come

00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:59,680
back to the module

00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:01,120
so now we've identified our module we've

00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:04,399
determined a role

00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:06,959
developed a plan what now

00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:08,000
well now you begin the journey into

00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:09,680
module ownership

00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,760
before you do anything you have to

00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:14,079
follow drupal's process for taking over

00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:15,920
an unsupported or abandoned project

00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:17,120
this includes reaching out to the owners

00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,959
and maintainers

00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,639
through an issue queue ticket this is

00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:21,920
where you can make your case as to why

00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:23,440
you should take over

00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,279
it certainly helps if you've already

00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,120
been active in the modules issue queue

00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:28,480
or at least the drupal community in

00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,720
general

00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,399
if the maintainers are responsive but

00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,279
maybe decline to make you an owner or

00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:35,839
maintainer

00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:37,519
don't be hurt or offended but if they

00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:39,120
are not responsive after a couple of

00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:41,360
weeks you can move your issue

00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,040
over to the ownership issue queue but

00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,560
just be aware that if your module is

00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,320
currently covered under drupal's

00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,920
security advisory policy

00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,600
you will need to have a vetted role

00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:51,360
before you can become an owner though

00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,959
this won't necessarily prevent you

00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,120
from obtaining maintainer or

00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:57,040
co-maintainer status

00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,800
so once you get access now the fun

00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,279
begins remember that road map that we

00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,279
mentioned

00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:02,560
just a moment ago well now it's time to

00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:04,480
put in action

00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,760
it's time to determine the priorities

00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,200
and to understand what kind of

00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,480
commitment you're able to make to the

00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,240
module

00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,839
are you going to be on your own or can

00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,680
you recruit some help

00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:15,120
for tv in particular we were really

00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,880
lucky that we had the support of our

00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,560
company as well as interest from our

00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:20,160
colleagues to help out

00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,760
but i think you can also lean on the

00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,519
community as well but

00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,120
that might take a little bit of time and

00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,880
work on your part in order to revive

00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:29,040
that interest from the community

00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,240
and probably won't happen right away but

00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:33,600
it all depends of course

00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:35,920
on how long the module has been inactive

00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,720
so as i've mentioned earlier we took

00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,920
over tb

00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:42,079
in 20 july of 2020.

00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,680
the d7 version had been stagnant since

00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:46,560
2015.

00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:48,000
d8 had not been updated since 2017 and

00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:50,880
was only a dev version of the

00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,760
time so as you can imagine there is a

00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:56,079
lot of work ahead for us

00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:57,839
we wanted to focus more of our time and

00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:59,839
energy

00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:02,000
to put towards getting a stable release

00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:04,639
for d89 but also while not

00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
neglecting the fact that 85 of our

00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:08,800
modules user base

00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,120
was still using d7 so we wanted to focus

00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:13,279
on a few things out of the gate here

00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,720
so we wanted to add accessibility for

00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:16,880
both d7 and 8.

00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,760
we wanted to fix any bugs particularly

00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:20,480
critical ones

00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:21,360
for seven and eight and finally get a

00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,600
beta release

00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,880
for d8 as well as making it d9

00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,720
compatible

00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:28,639
that felt like the most important and

00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:31,279
highest priorities for us

00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:32,959
once that was done we wanted to pursue a

00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:36,320
stable release of tv that's covered

00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:38,480
under drupal security advisory policy

00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,760
but then something really special

00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,800
started to happen while we were doing

00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:45,199
all this

00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:47,120
the community returned

00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:51,600
and this is the cool part leveraging the

00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:51,600
drupal and tv mega menu community

00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:57,360
to start you need to show that the

00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,519
module is active again

00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:02,079
so one of the first things we did was

00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:03,760
update tv's home page to let people know

00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:05,600
there were new maintainers and that we

00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:07,839
were working on the module

00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,639
as we continued working testing

00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:11,199
reviewing

00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:12,720
committing patches updating the module

00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:15,120
to be more accessible

00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,959
and cleaning up the issue queue overall

00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,279
it showed the community that we really

00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:20,720
were

00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:22,320
active with tb again this action is

00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,839
great for the community that already

00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,000
exists around your module

00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:27,760
because it helps restore faith and that

00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,560
helps the existing community

00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:32,240
be reassured they can continue using it

00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:34,959
this can also bring interest to

00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:36,880
potential new users

00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:40,000
another thing we did to help the tb

00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:43,279
community was update our documentation

00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:46,000
we provided updated versions for d7 8

00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:46,560
and 9. this allows for a simple and

00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,720
concise

00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:50,399
look at our documentation to see if the

00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,240
module will fit your needs

00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:54,880
and it helps new users get up and

00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:56,720
running more efficiently

00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:58,639
as we worked on these enhancements it

00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,399
showed the community we were working on

00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:02,399
advancing the module

00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:05,279
then the community let us know they were

00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:08,480
still there and interested in using tb

00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:11,600
between august 2020 and march 2021

00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:14,320
the d8 and 9 usage went from 1900 to

00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:16,560
2700 users

00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:18,399
as we continued working the community

00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,360
started to contribute and collaborate

00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:22,399
with us

00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:24,399
as a result more issues were logged and

00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:25,519
new requests for support features were

00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:27,680
added

00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:29,120
everybody who is reporting an issue or

00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:31,680
making a request

00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:33,519
is helping us to advance our module and

00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:36,639
also contributing back

00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:38,000
to drupal therefore helping drupal to

00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:39,680
advance

00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,079
it has been amazing watching the

00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:45,199
community get involved with tv mega menu

00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:47,839
again and as we said before open source

00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:50,160
is built on collaboration and community

00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:52,160
and as we're collaborating internally

00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,759
and bringing our plan to action to bring

00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:55,440
back life to tv

00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:58,160
we are now seeing the community

00:16:55,440 --> 00:17:00,720
collaborate with us to help advance tb

00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:02,959
even more this is what open source and

00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,279
contribution is all about and why it is

00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:05,919
so

00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:07,520
important to something like drupal being

00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:08,240
a part of contributing to the drupal

00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,079
community

00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:11,839
and advancing the community forward has

00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:13,520
been an incredible experience

00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:15,839
and we're just getting started started

00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:18,240
with tv and now we need to think about

00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:21,679
tv or the project long term and that

00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,679
brings us to our final step

00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:28,720
continuing to move the project forward

00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:31,039
so how do you continue to move forward

00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:32,720
since tb mega menu is nobody's main

00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:34,960
priority and taking owner

00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,840
over ownership of a project may never be

00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,600
yours

00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:39,600
it's important to come up with some ways

00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:43,520
to keep yourself and others accountable

00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,520
to continue advancing the project

00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,280
we established weekly meetings where we

00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:50,160
would review

00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:52,320
new issue queue items prioritize the new

00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,919
items as well as existing ones

00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,600
and give an update on what we had

00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:56,640
accomplished and we're going to tackle

00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,720
next

00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,559
we also use the jira board to help us

00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,400
organize our prioritization

00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:04,400
and what we were all working on are

00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,640
looking to accomplish

00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:08,720
we also did a lot of internal promoting

00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,720
on the new things we'd add to tb

00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:13,039
like updated accessibility and

00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:15,840
opportunities we have on tv for others

00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:18,400
to get involved in contributing

00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:20,960
we tried to make contributing to tv as

00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:23,200
as accessible as possible to our team

00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:24,000
by dedicating local environments to the

00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,799
d7

00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,720
8 and 9 version of the module and

00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:29,919
providing different ways those could

00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,000
contribute to tb

00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:34,000
other than just writing code like adding

00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,919
the new documentation or reviewing and

00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,760
testing patches

00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:39,840
our goal was to bring as much excitement

00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:41,600
as we have for tv to our drupal team and

00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:45,120
get others excited about contributing

00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:45,120
back to the drupal community

00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:51,039
moving forward is the last piece to our

00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,280
four-step

00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:55,280
process we started with talking about

00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:56,799
how you can identify a project and do

00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:59,600
something about it

00:18:56,799 --> 00:19:01,280
ways to revive a stagnant project how to

00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,640
leverage the community that exists

00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:04,559
around your project

00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:06,480
and some ideas to keep the momentum

00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:07,520
going and to keep the project moving

00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,520
forward

00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:11,360
our journey with tb didn't involve just

00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,679
wade and i but it's not going to tell

00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,600
you

00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:15,919
a bit more about the team behind the

00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,919
journey

00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,240
yeah as we begin to wrap up today i want

00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,919
to just quickly share some appreciation

00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:24,160
for those who have been a huge part of

00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:26,480
tv's successful revival

00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:28,160
first up is michael gurgas he's a senior

00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,360
front-end developer at bounties i've

00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,960
worked with michael at a previous

00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:33,120
company back in 2015

00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:34,559
and spent years trying to recruit him to

00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,720
join bounties

00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:39,200
finally got him too a couple years ago i

00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,960
think at this point

00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,320
he's an incredibly smart and talented

00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:44,720
person i've already gotten to work with

00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:46,720
him directly on a couple of projects

00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,919
and he has helped a lot with bug fixes

00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:50,799
for tv helped us

00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:51,520
organize for applying for security

00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:54,320
advisory

00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:56,000
policy coverage done tons of testing and

00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:57,840
has some really great ideas for our

00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,080
future 2x branch

00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:01,600
next is andrew olson andy's actually my

00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:03,760
career coach at bounties and he's

00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,880
been a big driver in getting me not only

00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,880
to contribute

00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:08,799
but also helped push me towards applying

00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:10,559
for ownership for tb

00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:12,400
i've gotten to work with andy on several

00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:14,480
projects including wilson.com where we

00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,840
first used tb mega minibounias and i

00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:18,159
think both of us have been pretty

00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:19,600
big drivers of its usage just in general

00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:21,520
at our company

00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:23,280
and then andy's also made some great

00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:25,200
contributions to the module as well

00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:26,960
particularly help keeping us on track

00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,480
and organized

00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:30,159
we also want to thank our company for

00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:32,080
not only providing us the time and

00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:34,400
ability for us to contribute

00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:36,320
but also for encouraging contributions

00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,520
it really means a lot to us that we get

00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,960
to do this

00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:41,280
and finally we want to thank another

00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,840
member of bounius who oddly wished to

00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:44,640
remain

00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:45,520
anonymous but uh he's been just a

00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:48,000
massive help

00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:49,039
in both cleaning up the d7 version and

00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,799
has been just

00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:53,039
instrumental in getting us to be able to

00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:54,480
apply for the security advisory policy

00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:56,320
coverage

00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:58,400
and then finally last but not least we

00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,840
want to thank the drupal community

00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:02,960
we want to thank the community as a

00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:04,640
whole and just not just simply by making

00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:06,320
updates to our module and replying to

00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:08,880
items in the issue queue

00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:09,760
this is organically resparked interest

00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:12,799
in our module

00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:14,480
and it's just it's been fantastic i mean

00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:16,000
nobody wants to see problems come up

00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,840
with their module but just the fact that

00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,360
people are there and reporting it

00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:24,640
and just there it's just it's wonderful

00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,640
and we really appreciate it

00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:28,799
so if you'd like to learn more about tb

00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:31,440
mega menu whether it's to consider using

00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:34,159
it or to help out with contributions

00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:35,520
check out our drupal.org project page we

00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:36,640
like i mentioned we're currently in

00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:39,360
progress of trying to

00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,400
obtain security advisory policy coverage

00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:43,760
in fact we are

00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:44,960
nearly there we are also about to start

00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:48,080
work on a whole

00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:49,760
a new whole 2x branch for d89 which is

00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:51,440
going to add lots of improvements and

00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:53,200
new features

00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:55,600
uh we're currently only really

00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:57,440
supporting bug fixes on d7

00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:59,520
however if the community would like to

00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:01,120
see d7 improvements before end of life

00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,080
we strongly encourage you to visit our

00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:04,000
issue queue

00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:05,440
while we're not actively working on any

00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,919
new features for d7

00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:09,919
we'd be really thrilled to include any

00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:12,240
community driven ones

00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:14,400
and then also you know please check out

00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:16,240
the fantastic blog written by michael

00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:19,120
gurgis it goes a little more in depth on

00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:21,600
all what we did for reviving this module

00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:23,360
and it's just a great companion piece to

00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,960
this presentation

00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:26,000
and just also a little reminder as we

00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,600
mentioned at the beginning of this

00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,280
presentation for our company

00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,640
for any attendee that visits our virtual

00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:32,559
booth and chats with us we're going to

00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,440
donate five dollars to regional animal

00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:35,039
rescues

00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:37,120
as well as five dollars to the drupal

association to continue support for open

00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:40,720
source technology you can just head to

00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:43,760
the expo area of hoping

00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:44,799
search for bounties and uh both irene

00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:47,120
and myself

00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:48,799
will be at the booth after the session

00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:50,640
as well as some others from bounty so if

00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:53,200
you want to chat with us or someone else

00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:54,559
we'd love to hear from you and as a

00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,559
reminder we're still going to be doing

00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:58,240
questions at the end of this session and

00:22:56,559 --> 00:23:01,280
then we can continue questions

00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,280
at the booth later on

00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:06,480
so i hope we've inspired you to give

00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,159
back if you know a module or theme you'd

00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,760
be interested in contributing to

00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:12,400
go to the issue queue and see where you

00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:13,360
can help out if you're looking for ideas

00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,039
on where to begin

00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:17,039
we have some links here that give more

00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:19,280
details into the steps for applying for

you can contribute back to drupal

00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:32,559
without having to write any code

00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:34,000
we also have a link at the top here for

00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:34,880

questions

00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:20,480
and what the best fit for you may be

00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:26,720
thank you for attending our session

00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:28,000
rescuing a module how we revived an

00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,520
abandoned project

00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,120
we hope you enjoyed listening to our

00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:33,279
story and that we've inspired you to

00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:35,120
start your own contribution journey

00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:37,039
whether it be giving back to a module in

00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:39,520
the form of fixes or enhancements

00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:40,480
or taking ownership in order to revive a

00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,080
module

00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:46,640
we're sure you'll find it as rewarding

00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:48,320
as we do

00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:50,880
thanks again and we'll go ahead and

00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:52,960
start looking through the questions

00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:54,480
yeah and and while we do that i just uh

00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:57,200
closed up the poll

00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:57,840
um so yeah this this is great so it

00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,559
looks like

00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:02,320
yeah like 53 of you have have

00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:03,039
contributed four so that's that's

00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:06,640
awesome

00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:08,880
um you know i see that 26 percent

00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:10,480
uh said no but they would like to so i

00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:13,600
hope one way or another

00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:14,000
this session has inspired you to to try

00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:17,279
to do

00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:19,440
something um because like we

00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:21,360
like we mentioned before it it can be

00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:23,440
really daunting and overwhelming but

00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:24,640
once we kind of jumped in and did it you

00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:26,640
know we found that it

00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:28,240
wasn't that anymore and it was like

00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:31,360
really rewarding and really fun

00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:32,400
so yeah definitely not anything to to be

00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:34,640
afraid of

00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,640
um

00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:42,000
okay so yeah i guess i see the first

00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:46,720
question was clarify what we mean by tv

00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:49,520
so technically tv means two things

00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:51,120
before we took over tv it was actually

00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:53,600
named tv because it was

00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:54,720
an organization called the theme brain

00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,480
so it was named

00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:58,880
basically after their company so it was

00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:02,000
the theme brain mega menu

00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:05,200
um whenever we took over i mean

00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,799
not to be in any way negative or like

00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:10,240
erase

00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:11,760
you know the the previous maintainers

00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:14,000
we just we kind of wanted to make it a

00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:17,360
little bit more general i mean

00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:19,360
we took over this as a company so

00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:20,559
you know we we wanted to kind of unbrand

00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:23,600
it in that way a little bit

00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:25,440
so one of actually michael uh gergis who

00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,000
i mentioned earlier i think actually

00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:28,000
thought

00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,360
of or maybe it was someone else from our

00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,000
company i can't remember who but anyway

00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:32,400
we thought like oh the better mega menu

00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,679
like

00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:39,840
kind of makes more sense now so that's

00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:39,840
that's basically what that means

00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:45,200
so yeah let's see what are some good

00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:48,480
business arguments for

00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:50,840
devoting resources to a contrib module

00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:52,000
looking for the enlightened

00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:54,960
self-interest

00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:58,480
um that's yeah i don't know how to

00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:58,480
answer that necessarily um

00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:03,760
yeah i guess it's just you know as an

00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:06,320
organization i mean we have a whole

00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:10,720
practice that's devoted to drupal

00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:12,320
um so with that in mind i mean we

00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:14,480
this is this is part of our livelihood

00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:16,480
so we we want to make sure to support

00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:18,559
you know the the open source platform

00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:19,520
that we that we're making money off of

00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:20,000
you know essentially like any

00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,840
organization

00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,840
that's using drupal is making money off

00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:26,320
of an open source platform

00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:27,200
so i think it just it just makes sense

00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:30,159
that you know

00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:31,200
in the with us using it that we we make

00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:33,279
sure to give back

00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,320
and it's yeah that's just really

00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:37,440
important

00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:40,799
and i guess you know as far as

00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:42,640
what module i think you know we chose

00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:44,000
we chose this module just because we've

00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:47,440
used it a lot

00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:50,399
uh in our organization i want to say

00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:51,120
uh you know five six seven sites at the

00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:53,200
very least

00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:54,399
you know anybody that's needed uh a

00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,799
fairly complex

00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:59,039
and custom you know where every single

00:27:56,799 --> 00:28:01,360
menu drop down column needs to act

00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:03,440
completely different from the next you

00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:04,399
know that this module has been essential

00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:07,679
to that so

00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:09,440
it just i think that's maybe yeah from a

00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:10,000
from a business argument like it makes

00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,960
sense

00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,679
you know and also we've just done a lot

00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,159
of our own

00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:19,520
work on the module so again it just kind

00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:19,520
of makes sense to to get back

00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:25,279
all right um what strategies are

00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:28,799
implemented for converting

00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:31,200
uh drupal 7 module to drupal 8

00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:32,720
um that's that's a good question so i

00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,360
will say that when we took over this

00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:36,240
module

00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:37,039
um we already had i mean there was

00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,799
already

00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:40,880
a seven and eight version so the

00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:42,320
previous maintainers had already ported

00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:44,799
it over

00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:45,679
um that's something like i've been

00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:48,399
involved with

00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:50,559
migrations before you know um updating a

00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:50,880
site from seven to eight but as far as

00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:54,320
i'm

00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:55,200
you know moving a module over uh i'm not

00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:57,600
sure that that's

00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,320
that's a good question i i feel like you

00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,520
know there's

00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:02,080
probably got to be some pretty good

00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:05,039
documentation on drupal.org

00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:05,840
for you know for basically porting a

00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:09,039
module from

00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:09,039
from one version to the next

00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:15,440
all right so have you been able to take

00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:17,600
advantage of tools like upgrade status

00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:19,360
drupal rector to set your sites on

00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:21,200
drupal 9 compatibility

00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:22,799
uh yes that is that is definitely

00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:26,080
something that we

00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:29,200
we did um

00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:31,039
the pun uh pun intended great yeah um

00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:33,120
yes we we took advantage of as many

00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:35,760
tools as we possibly could

00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:37,039
um to catch stuff i know that they're i

00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,760
can't remember what it's called but i

00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:40,799
guess there's that

00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:42,720
auto bot in the issue queue that will

00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:45,520
also run tests for you to see

00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:47,760
you know what what deprecated code you

00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:50,960
might have and some things like that

00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:52,399
um so yes you know definitely

00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:54,000
take advantage of those tools because it

00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:56,640
was very very helpful actually

00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,720
made the process fairly easy now i mean

00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:01,279
luckily our module did not have

00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:02,640
a ton of deprecated code or any issues

00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:05,120
that we really needed to clean up

00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:09,679
specifically for drupal 9

00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:11,440
but yeah the tools were huge help there

00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:13,279
how complicated was it to get the

00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:15,039
security team's approval so technically

00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:19,440
we haven't gotten approval yet

00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:22,080
we have applied uh we did get a response

00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:23,200
from the security team uh there was a

00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:26,320
prr review

00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:28,399
that was done we basically had

00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:30,720
a couple of issues we needed to clean up

00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:32,880
there were a few false flags

00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:34,960
we've addressed all of that and we're

00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:37,760
pretty much just waiting for a response

00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:38,720
so we do believe we are very very close

00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,640
to getting

00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:44,799
uh security coverage which means we'll

00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:44,799
have a stable release out for the module

00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:50,159
so any any other questions that we can

00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,520
answer

00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:54,080
i hope i answered everything that's

00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:57,840
there so far pretty well

00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:57,840
or at least a satisfactory answer

00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:05,919
oh yeah somebody in the channel said

00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:09,360
it's the project update bot

00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:12,000
so thank you appreciate that

00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:12,960
um yeah so i guess we're technically a

00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,159
couple of minutes

00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:17,360
over um and i see somebody in the chat

00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:18,240

00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:20,799
current project
