[Laughter]

00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:06,399
rachel has very generously given us the

00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:07,600
first question which is what's

00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:17,680
everyone's favorite thing about

00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:19,920
drupalcon this week so far

00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,279
i love watching the chat in all the the

00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,480
different sessions

00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:28,320
um it's it's not the same as being

00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:30,880
in person but it's it is really nice

00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,760
to kind of like see people like

00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,600
interacting

00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,120
and like getting just excited about

00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,880
stuff um

00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,800

00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,559
popping in and out of the hallway tracks

00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:43,280
as well so that's been a lot of fun

00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:44,079
so the community bit the interaction bit

00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,280

00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,920
is introduce ourselves for those that

00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,519
um we've got some cues coming in you

00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:25,199

00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,280
this one from matthew is how would you

00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,280
like to see

00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,960
agencies or developers at agencies

00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:35,520
better support the drupal missions

00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:37,040
what's kind of most important for

00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:40,840
listeners out there to to know

00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:42,479
about supporting drupal on an ongoing

00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:44,560
basis

00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:46,400
carrie why don't you take them away and

00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,440
we'll let somebody like ryan who's with

00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,960
an agency

00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,960
a service provider kind of give their

00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:53,520
perspective as well

00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:55,759
yeah so from a leadership perspective i

00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:58,720
mean my team deals a lot with

00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:00,560
agency leaders that want to give back to

00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,720
the drupal association because they use

00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:05,199
it at their organization

00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,120
and they want some extra visibility or

00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:10,320
training on how to contribute back to

00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:12,880
the drupal project so as i mentioned um

00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,520
in my introduction a huge focus for us

00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:17,199
this year

00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:18,800
is increasing contribution and um

00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:20,960
one of the best resources that we have

00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,320
right now you know is our huge network

00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,720
of

00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,320
agencies that are currently using drupal

00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:29,039
but might not be giving back

00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:30,800
in the form of contributions so i'd love

00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:31,360
to see more agencies get involved in

00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,479
that

00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:36,639
um path it's just a really good way to

00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:38,560
get your staff more engaged with drupal

00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,919
and the drupal community

00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,919
even if they're not experts in

00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:43,680
particular areas

00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:44,960
if they have different areas where they

00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,479
want to grow their skills

00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:50,000
it's a really good opportunity for

00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:50,000
professional development as well

00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:55,120
how about you ryan anything from an

00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:57,199
agency leader perspective yeah

00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:00,000
i think that each of us as agency

00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:03,039
leaders and as developers at agencies

00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,479
you kind of have to translate

00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:09,199
the drupal association mission into

00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:10,400
like your particular situation or

00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,639
setting

00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:15,199
because the drupal association's mission

00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:17,039
is to you know unite a global community

00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:20,479
to build secure and promote

00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:23,440
drupal but like if you're in higher ed

00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:25,759
or if you're in india versus germany or

00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:27,520
if you're in e-commerce versus not

00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:29,199
whatever like like it means something

00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,319
different to promote drupal within that

00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:32,560
context

00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:33,440
and i think that each of us should feel

00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,240
the freedom

00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:37,440
um to just like put your own

00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,280
interpretation of that

00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:41,039
mission on the work that you do and so

00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:43,120
that's why even like we focused on just

00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:44,639
articulating our vision

00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,720
um for the work that we do with drupal

00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:47,440
commerce really zeroing in on what it

00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,160
means to be

00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:52,000
open source and to protect freedoms and

00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,080
privacy and things like that

00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,520
and that's speaking to our audience i

00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,039
think that any agency

00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,360
you know they have an audience and they

00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:02,080
can translate that mission into

00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,759
their context and use that to kind of

00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:07,280
basically serve as extensions of the

00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:07,280
drupal association in that mission

00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:13,680
awesome yeah um i was going to say too

00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,199
um even if you don't have code

00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,280
experience there are tons of like

00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,000
non-code opportunities to get involved

00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,840
so

00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,680
we we really we're trying to kind of

00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,840
refocus some efforts around our promote

00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,960
drupal initiative which is

00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,360
a way that we're trying to kind of

00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:29,440
gather um folks together just to help

00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,800
spread the word about drupal so

00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,800
if that's of interest to you that's

00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:35,039
definitely a big focus area for us as

00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,039
well

00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,400
and commit code

00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:42,160
if you can

00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,560
another another question here uh from

00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,919
mark audrey this is kind of an

00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,479
operational question

00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:51,440
so why have we chosen sort of this q a

00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:53,120
panel format

00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,720
as opposed to what we've done at some

00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,440
previous drupal cons and just doing sort

00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,319
of

00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:59,680
uh put put the board under glass and

00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:02,720
watch a public board meeting

00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:04,000
um any reason for doing it this way i i

00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,680
saw this question come in i

00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,280
uploaded it as well because i think it's

00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:10,479
a good one um

00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:12,400
yeah so i think um we

00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:14,479
well a couple things happened last year

00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:17,680
with uh obviously with the pandemic

00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:18,080
and it kind of threw things uh into a

00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,080
spin

00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,520
in terms of looking at the way the the

00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,520
board was meeting

00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:25,120
and convening and communicating and and

00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:27,520
things like that and

00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,319
it did give us an opportunity to think

00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:31,440
about

00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:33,120
what was um you know what we were doing

00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:36,760
from a communication standpoint

00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:39,200
and i think that generally weren't that

00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:40,880
satisfied with the um the way that we

00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,360
had been doing things you know

00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,080
like like to mention you know going to a

00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,640
drupal con

00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,480
and then having what was billed as a a

00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,480
public board meeting but really was an

00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,880
executive director update

00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,240
where people had a chance to to ask

00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,480
questions um and

00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,480
i think that those executive director

00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,160
updates are really important so like

00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,959
hearing from heather hearing from the

00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,560
team

00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:04,480
um you know through the newsletters and

00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:07,440
the blog posts and things like that

00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,560
um and and i think the you know where we

00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,080
can be effective

00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:12,560
in communicating from a board

00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:14,320
perspective is things like this where

00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:16,880
where we kind of we can actually kind of

00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:19,519
come and answer very specific questions

00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:22,160
um where it's not necessarily taking up

00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:24,720
the time of an executive director update

00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:26,560
um so because i think those are those

00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:29,760
are kind of two different things

00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:31,440
but it is an area that we would like to

00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,120
expand in terms of what we're doing from

00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:36,320
a board perspective

00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,680
in terms of expanding communications

00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,600
and one of the things that we'd like to

00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:42,720
do this year is

00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:46,160
more of them so um you know

00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:48,720
going to events like drupalcon we we did

00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:50,399
a panel at drupaljam for example a

00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,760
couple of months ago

00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:53,600
where we were able to kind of come

00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:56,000
together staff and board

00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,600
to answer questions and i'd like us to

00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,240
to do that because i think it's i think

00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:02,720
it's a good opportunity for us to hear

00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,320
what people have on their minds and an

00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,200
answer and address address things as

00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,800
they go

00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,040
um and then i think there's probably

00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,000
some other communication opportunities i

00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,839
would like for us to

00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,760
take advantage of maybe you know

00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:15,360
publishing updates on on what's

00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,880
happening from a strategy point of view

00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,839
for example so

00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:21,519
um yeah so we we i hopefully this is a

00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:22,399
slightly better format than what we've

00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:24,000
done in the past

00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:26,720
takes advantage of what we're doing now

00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
virtually but even once we are able to

00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,800
meet in person again i think we'll

00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,640
probably

00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,000
want to separate things out a little bit

00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,880
to where we can have

00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
both executive director updates and um q

00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:38,720
a sessions

00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,079
i hope that answers it dad and just to

00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,839
be blatantly honest

00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:43,120
there are few things more boring for

00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:47,040
someone to watch than an

00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:47,040
actual board meeting that board meetings

00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,320
they're not designed to be informative

00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,399
from a community perspective so i think

00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,839
it's it's less of taking something away

00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:57,440
and it's more of shifting to what's

00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:59,440
going to be the most helpful

00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:02,079
for the community that's a good way to

00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,079
put it i think

00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,839
right and just to hop on the

00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:06,640
communications thing the community

00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:08,480
committee

00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,760
is trying really hard to increase

00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,480
communications this year through

00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:13,279
everything that

00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,680
audra has talked about spoken about also

00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,200
the

00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,880
the d.a staff and some of the board

00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,360
members try to be out in the community

00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,519
more

00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:21,440
they're trying to attend camps and you

00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:23,120
know things of that nature so that

00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,279
they can hear what the community has to

00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:27,600
say and be more um

00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:28,560
you know let them know what the the d.a

00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,000
is doing and also

00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,279
would like to hear what the community is

00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,480
doing so i think where that's an

00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:35,680
emphasis this year

00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:39,680
as well right um related to something

00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:42,560
uh um about

00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:44,560
in-person types of events and activities

00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:48,320
is there a plan to return to in-person

00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:48,320
conferences when it's safe to do so

00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:53,680
yes

00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:57,839
[Laughter]

00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:57,839
jordan answered

00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,200
so here's how i look at it long term you

00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,120
know

00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,720
there's absolutely so much value to

00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:09,120
getting together in person right there's

00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,160
a reason drupal cons were a gathering of

00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,760
people

00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:14,240
for a variety of reasons right and we

00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:16,240
don't want to lose that opportunity

00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,519
there's also things we've learned that

00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,920
are really upside

00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:21,760
factors to holding something virtually

00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,760
so i think what we have to look at

00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:25,200
is what are ways that we can convene the

00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:27,200
community both in person

00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,480
and online and i don't necessarily mean

00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,680
at the same event

00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,160
because that's a little bit of a

00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:35,120
nightmare to orchestrate operationally

00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:37,040
but can we do things online more often

00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:39,440
outside of a traditional drupalcon

00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,560
once once the world opens up and we're

00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,560
able to do things

00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:44,320
and does drupalcon itself in person need

00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:46,160
to look a little different right so

00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:48,399
we don't really know what the landscape

00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:50,320
of 2022 looks like

00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:52,560
but i think you know we're committed to

00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:55,120
doing what makes sense both in person

00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:56,639
and online because you know if you think

00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,639
about a third of the people here this

00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:01,279
week are new to drupalcon

00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:02,639
150 scholarship attendees got to come

00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:03,680
that wouldn't have been able to attend

00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:05,519
otherwise

00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:07,680
you know p so we have to make sure that

00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:08,720
we always have an opportunity to remove

00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,800
barriers

00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:13,040
to a traditional drupal con in addition

00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:15,200
to hosting the in-person version so

00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:17,040
a little bit of a long-winded answer to

00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,639
that but it's a little complicated when

00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,920
we think about what we can do and what

00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:21,839
we should do

00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:23,040
but do we want to be in person and is

00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:25,680
that the plan

00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:27,360
absolutely for a variety of reasons with

00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,040
the caveat that we may also do

00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,959
additional things online

00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:33,440
to better collaborate with the community

00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:35,600
and to get people together

00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:37,680
i can't wait to go back to in-person

00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,440
events

00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:42,240
yeah there's something so personally

00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:44,079
yeah yeah i mean

00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,360
even with our virtual hallway tracks and

00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:45,920
things like that which i think have been

00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,680
awesome

00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:49,519
and like pet buffs and all that other

00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,959
kind of stuff which really helped

00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:53,519
there's still something that we can't

00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:55,360
quite capture

00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:57,440
let's see i'm continuing in order of the

00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,959
most uploaded questions here a question

00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,560
from mike what can we do to help make

00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:02,880
contribution more sustainable

00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:04,720
mike references jake rockowitz's

00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:06,079
discussions about the web form module

00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,160
for example

00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:09,839
what can the da do to help channel

00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:12,240
dollars to maintainers

00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:13,680
important modules or other ways support

00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,920
sustainability

00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:17,440
and i'd love to get a variety of answers

00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:19,199
here and maybe some of our

00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,880
community folks i don't know leslie or

00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:21,360
pedro if you've heard from maintainers

00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,680
sort of

00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:31,839
what the landscape around maintainer

00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:31,839
sustainability is lately

00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:39,440
i can start definitely sure

00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:42,560
um jacob's point are

00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:45,680
are really valid um

00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:46,800
i was reading his vlogs for his blog

00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:49,040
posts

00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:51,360
very eagerly because he remains on valid

00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:53,440
points and he makes a valid point of

00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,800
okay what happens with uh when a

00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,680
developer

00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:58,639
um is kind of driven away from drupal

00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:01,040
like

00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:01,839
i think it was his somehow his case like

00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,519
his company

00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:05,199
decided to do something else and then

00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:10,639
what can you do right

00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:10,639
um in terms of making the

00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:16,320
contribution more sustainable um i think

00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:19,760
this is a problem that

00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:22,480
the d.a needs to to work on and i think

00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:23,519
it's a part of uh of the of the mission

00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:27,120
we should have and

00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:27,920
um i was recently having a conversation

00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:31,360
with um

00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:33,120
a distribution that um focus on farmers

00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:36,079
and it's based on drupal

00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:37,519
farm os and um they're having the same

00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:40,160
problem in their

00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:40,560
in their scale it's like how they make

00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,639
this

00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,600
more sustainable i think the the the

00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:46,240
companies

00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:48,800
play a big role in here and allowing

00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:52,839
contributions more and uh

00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:56,720
focusing more on the on the

00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:59,040
um developer side of of allowing people

00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,600
to contribute and uh fostering that and

00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,279
that's

00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,720
i think that's something yeah so so i

00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:05,199
agree with that um

00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,880
getting new folks in having these

00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:08,320
initiatives this week and getting people

00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:11,199
excited about different

00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:12,720
strategic initiatives and getting them

00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:14,160
to come and contribute

00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,160
will help the maintainers because

00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,839
they'll have now another a whole group

00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,839
of people that can help them

00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:21,440
so that it won't be all on one person's

00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:22,079
shoulder or a couple people's shoulders

00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,360
to maintain

00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:25,279
everything you know the more

00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:27,120
contributors we add uh the more

00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:28,639
excitement we get about contributing

00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,560
you know the better the landscape will

00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:33,920
be for everybody that maintains

00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:35,440
um modules heather you

00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:38,079
i mean i know there's been some work

00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:40,000
from a volunteer programming

00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:41,199
and you know kind of trying to think

00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,360
about matchmaking

00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:44,720
in terms of lining up people who are who

00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:47,199
want to contribute

00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,320
with areas that need to be and need need

00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:52,160
attention

00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:52,160
do you want to add anything to that

00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,759
yeah so you know i think we we started a

00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:58,160
process

00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:59,360
early this year and and put some things

00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:01,360
into place i think they're

00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:03,040
you know the biggest thing we've we've

00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:05,120
got to think through

00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:06,559
as a community when it when it comes to

00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:09,919
maintainers

00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:12,720
and and even kind of key contributors is

00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:13,520
how how are we looking at succession

00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,679
planning and

00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:18,400
it's not that we want anybody to go away

00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:21,039
but succession planning plus support

00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,480
right because not everybody can do one

00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:25,360
thing forever

00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:27,280
in any community in any capacity and so

00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:28,880
how are we supporting people so they're

00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,480
not the only person

00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:32,400
which means we've got to be thinking

00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,080
about who has similar skill sets and

00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,120
interests that we can use that can be

00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:37,760
mentored

00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,960
alongside current contribution leaders

00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,880
and maintainers and

00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:43,039
and how do we kind of keep the pipeline

00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,760
going so that we've got a broader set of

00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:45,520
people

00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,799
with the knowledge to step in and help

00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:49,440
something get done

00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:50,960
and i think that takes time but but i

00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:53,600
think that we've we've gotta

00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,080
we've got an opportunity to be able to

00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,240
map

00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:57,600
people's interests and skill sets and

00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:00,000
availability

00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:01,360
and to take that information in and to

00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,799
do that matchmaking

00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,559
and then be able to get that to the

00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:05,919
people that need help i think the other

00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:08,960
piece is

00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:10,799
most people and this is in any volunteer

00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,280
organization right so this this cuts

00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:14,400
across

00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:16,400
open source and beyond people typically

00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,000
don't ask for help and raise the flag

00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:20,799
until they've already kind of burnt

00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:23,039
out and it's a little bit too late so

00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:24,320
even if people aren't saying hi i need

00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:26,400
help someone come

00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:28,080
let me let me teach you the ropes we've

00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,400
got to be proactive in that

00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:32,320
and help our our leaders understand that

00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,799
it's as much a mental health

00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:36,400
um support system as it is anything else

00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:38,240
because the stress and the burden of

00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:41,360
doing those things on your own

00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:43,120
for a long time is is really harmful

00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:45,280
over time if we don't find a way to

00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:46,720
support that better

00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:48,720
i would also say like i mean the

00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:51,679
question was what can ada do to

00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,160
channel more money to maintainers and i

00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:54,880
think

00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:55,919
today the d8 doesn't do that much right

00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,240
if you think about

00:18:55,919 --> 00:19:00,160
all of the project pages etc etc so i

00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,679
think there's a massive opportunity

00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:05,280
and as heather mentioned we have a lot

00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:08,799
of great ideas of things we could do

00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:09,679
i would also say it's one thing to do

00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:12,400
things on

00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:13,200
maybe drupal.org but we can also talk

00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,600
about

00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,559
what can we change in the product itself

00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:19,840
because

00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:22,480
quite honestly making changes to drupal

00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:24,320
to help sort of channel uh you know

00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:26,640
money to maintainers

00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:28,400
can probably have a much bigger impact

00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:31,840
than making changes

00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:33,440
to drupal the dory itself so i think um

00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:35,840
often when i suggest that people are

00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:37,360
like no way we can do that

00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:39,120
you know but i think there is much more

00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:42,480
we can do um

00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:43,679
even outside of dda2 and you know i kind

00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,600
of like that we're having these

00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:47,440
conversations because

00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,880
you know figuring out how to make it all

00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:51,280
more sustainable

00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:52,720
uh it's really important for drupal as

00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:56,000
well as for open source

00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:57,440
more broadly quite honestly so

00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,520
and there's there's a sense in which

00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,919
like i'm not sure the drupal association

00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:05,200
should be trying to

00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:07,200
solve the problem on its own but

00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,480
have the companies and the maintainers

00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,400
and the stakeholders in the community

00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:12,480
do their experimentation to find out

00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,000
what really moves the needle and then

00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:16,720
the da can

00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,120
help support and amplify that but if

00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,919
just

00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:21,120
just in real numbers i mean everybody

00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:23,520
that made

00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:25,120
requires a different level of income and

00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,159
the amount that they might get from ad

00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:28,799
hoc sponsorship

00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:29,280
unless it's like a company paying them

00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:32,640
to do

00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:34,080
anything it's it's really really hard to

00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,200
create a uniform plan that could really

00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:38,400
move the needle for

00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:39,919
freaking trip uh i mean just look like

00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,880
like if you took my company like i would

00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:42,640
need

00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:44,559
like two to three hundred thousand

00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:47,600
dollars for them

00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:49,280
to cover the salaries of the amount of

00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,880
maintainership that we do on commerce

00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:54,240
right now and when we don't do it no

00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:55,679
we want to do more um and and

00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,360
i don't practically see the drupal

00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:59,440
association being the problem solver for

00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:01,840
how does centauro build a company

00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:04,080
that can invest thousand dollars a

00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:05,600
million dollars a year and more

00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:07,200
into maintaining these modules that

00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,480
feels like a market problem for us to

00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,000
figure out

00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,280
and then to tell the drupal association

00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,720
if you could do this then that would

00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:16,000
help us

00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:17,919
but that that's my two cents

00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,440
one way to think about the problem maybe

00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:22,480
is let's say you are

00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:23,840
a marketer uh maybe a less technical

00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:27,679
person and you're using

00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:29,600
the web forms module in a site

00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:31,360
and let's say you want a feature added

00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:33,840
to this web forms thing

00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:35,039
i mean think about the process that

00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:38,000
somebody has to go

00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:38,960
through to figure out how to actually

00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,760
make a change

00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:43,120
and who to pay i mean it's almost

00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:45,039
impossible

00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:47,039
for most people to figure out well

00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:50,640
that's actually the web forms module

00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:51,600
if i can go here look there's 27

00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:54,799
contributors

00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:55,440
but oh should i pay to do this i mean

00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:58,159
like it's

00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,559
it's we're actually not even trying to

00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:01,440
make it

00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:01,440
easy you know

00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,880
we hadn't really thought about thought

00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:06,799
of it from that perspective as the

00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:09,360
as it's kind of been developed right as

00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:11,760
the processes have been developed

00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:12,400
right yeah wonder what if that's

00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,159
something that

00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,760
could uh come in with the project

00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:18,159
browser

00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:20,159
exactly it seems really well aligned

00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:23,280
with that potential initiative yeah

00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:26,400
yeah um

00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:27,919
our next question here um from matthew

00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,520
is related to the length of sessions

00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:31,520
here at the virtual drupal con and i

00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:33,360
happen to know the answers related to

00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:35,039
it being virtual but why are most of the

00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:37,360
individual

00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:38,960
uh 30 minutes as opposed to hour long

00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:40,400
set

00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,080
i think heather you under you know some

00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:45,919
of the logic behind us

00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:49,039
i do so feedback

00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:50,960
best practices and the reality of of

00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:52,320
people and the way they consume virtual

00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:54,960
events right now

00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:55,679
so one of the things we learned you know

00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:58,559
we were

00:22:55,679 --> 00:23:00,159
one of the first big events out of the

00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:02,159
gate that went virtual in the drupal

00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:03,840
community and in other communities and

00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:05,520
aspects as well last summer when we did

00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:07,520
drupalcon global

00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:09,200
and so we had the perspective that was

00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,640
kind of the complete opposite that we

00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,880
took this summer so it was

00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:14,799
let's do 12 hours a day so we can cover

00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,240
every time zone and let's make the

00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:18,080
sessions as long as they would be at

00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,840
drupalcon and let's have the same amount

00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,400
of stuff and let's just get let's just

00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,080
have

00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:24,720
as much as we can push through because

00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:26,480
it's virtual and we can

00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:28,320
and about three or four months later

00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:29,280
what was becoming obvious is people

00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:32,480
wanted less

00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:34,080
because they're they just the it

00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:36,080
not even an attention span thing right

00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:39,039
just the world the way it is and the way

00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,600
and what we were capable of absorbing uh

00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:41,840
was

00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,720
you know people wanted they wanted less

00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,880
but they wanted

00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:46,000
they wanted more things that were

00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,679
shorter

00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,600
it's kind of how it was what we were

00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:50,240
hearing and it's some of the same reason

00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:53,679
that it's a

00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:55,760
four hours of live content not 12. um

00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:57,440
people wanted shorter days that they

00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:59,039
could blend into their work-life

00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:01,679
integration they wanted to

00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:04,159
they didn't have the luxury of of being

00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:05,600
on site and being able to have a full

00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:07,279
conference day so

00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,799
all of those things played into kind of

00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:10,640
shortening the sessions and then the

00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:11,840
shorter sessions also allowed us to have

00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:13,600
more sessions

00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:15,760
even though the live content time was

00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:18,000
truncated so we we learned a lot of

00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:19,440
things along the way from last summer

00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,200
and implemented some of those best

00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:22,320
practices it doesn't mean that it's

00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,080
going to stay

00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:26,080
that you know when we talk about what

00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:27,360
comes next you know if it's in person

00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,799
that doesn't mean that the sessions

00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,360
would need to be that short again it was

00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:33,840
just

00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:33,840
by virtue of this virtual setting

00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:40,320
oh ruby really

00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,600
oh go ahead well i'm just saying it's

00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:45,120
very consistent with what

00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:46,880
all other organizations have been doing

00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:49,440
the shorter sessions actually i feel

00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:52,320
like nowadays 20 minutes sessions are

00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:53,440
best practice so in a way ours are 50

00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:55,600
longer still

00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:58,400
than what most organizations do today

00:24:55,600 --> 00:25:01,440
yeah i know it sounds crazy but

00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:03,200
that's the new norm is 20 minutes that

00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,880
lightning talk experience where you're

00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,720
just getting kind of

00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:09,600
nuggets of of wizards i think you know

00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,600
there's a longer session

00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:17,200
okay tim and you know this is this is of

00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:19,520
course all going to transform again the

00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:21,120
next time we come around to whatever

00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:24,960
uh the combination of impression and

00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:24,960
virtual are in 2022.

00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:31,440
um question from ruby so are the board

00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:33,039
meetings non-drupal con related board

00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,960
meetings just the regular board meetings

00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:36,799
normally open to the community

00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:40,000
i appreciate the transparency even if i

00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:43,440
don't have a specific question to ask

00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:45,760
i can talk about this a little bit um

00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:46,559
i think uh the the board meetings

00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:49,360
typically

00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:50,960
we are talking about um specific

00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:53,679
strategic issues

00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:56,000
a lot of times there are things that we

00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:58,320
cannot talk about publicly um

00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,919
yet either for legal reasons or privacy

00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:03,200
reasons or what have you

00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:05,520
um so i it's not

00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,480
um i don't think it's typically the type

00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,559
of thing that

00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:10,000
we would be able to open up because of

00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:13,440
the some of the things that we

00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:16,000
talk about um i do i do think

00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:16,640
i would like us to have more opportunity

00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,200
to have

00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:20,240
sessions with that that are open to the

00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:23,600
community though

00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:24,880
um so i think while maybe a typical

00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,400
board meeting

00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:28,880
isn't something that we could open up to

00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:31,200
everybody we should be having more

00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:33,120
opportunities where we can you know we

00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:36,159
can talk about things and we can

00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:39,679
answer questions like this publicly

00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:41,120
um and i i think um i know this is

00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:43,200
somewhat limiting you know where people

00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:45,039
are having to type in their questions

00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:47,360
rather than being able to have a

00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:50,400
dialogue um so maybe we

00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:51,679
set up another session where people can

00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:54,640
actually kind of

00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:56,720
ask on you know um using audio rather

00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:59,919
than having to type things in

00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:01,760
um but i i just don't think

00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:04,080
yeah hopefully that answer that into the

00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,080
question

00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:07,919
a lot of it relates to what we talked

00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:11,039
about earlier right just kind of

00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:13,200
that board meetings aren't designed

00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:14,880
to be all that communicative and

00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,320
interactive and helpful for those that

00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,880
aren't board members so i think it's all

00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,159
about

00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:20,480
what are the ways that we can

00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:21,919
communicate and more often

00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:23,600
in a way that that feels really

00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:24,720
accessible to the community and

00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,960
and that's something we're really

00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:29,440
working on yeah

00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:31,120
yeah i mean i i think oftentimes these

00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:33,600
are their discussions

00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:35,520
um and sometimes we are coming to

00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:37,600
decisions and we're voting on things but

00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:39,039
but oftentimes they are they're kind of

00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:41,840
discussions in progress

00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:43,279
so i'm not sure if any of the other um

00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:45,440
if leslie or pedro or

00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:47,120
ryan if any of you have anything to add

00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:48,880
or dress in terms of how we

00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:52,240
we run them that you think kind of might

00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:52,240
add shed some more light on it

00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:58,000
i i don't think people look at the

00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:05,520
meeting minutes that we have in the

00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:07,520
in the accountability section

00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:09,360
yeah and uh we could publish more in

00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:13,120
there um

00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:14,960
i know i did look at that often

00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:16,880
so i think for me it would be good to

00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:18,000
know like what what problem are we

00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:21,279
trying to solve

00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:23,520
in a way like is it transparency

00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:24,399
are people wondering what we're talking

00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:26,000
about

00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:28,880
that could have one kind of solution

00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:31,279
which is uh maybe we make

00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:33,039
more detailed minutes or maybe even like

00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:33,440
make a recording available of the

00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:36,480
session

00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:38,799
of the parts that um you know are don't

00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:40,720
have sensitive information let's say

00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:42,399
but another problem could be people want

00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:45,440
to provide more inputs

00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:46,799
you know they want to help um they want

00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,520
to be part of the discussion or

00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:49,279
something

00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:51,360
which is different from transparency and

00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:53,919
there's probably different solutions

00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:55,039
for that as well so it might be good to

00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:56,960
kind of

00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:59,520
when we do another survey or something

00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:02,559
to try and gauge

00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:05,200
what problem we're trying to solve yeah

00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:05,200
just a thought

00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,360
because there's really from you know i

00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,760
think we can be

00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:13,120
very transparent for almost every topic

00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:16,799
that we discuss

00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:18,240
quite honestly it's you know

00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:21,120
it's very rare that we have a very

00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,120
sensitive topic

00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:28,720
so tim i've got one for you and

00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:30,640
and and that and that is is there a way

00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:32,159
to track non-code related drupal

00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:34,240
contributions i know we've

00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:35,200
contributions been a big topic this week

00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,880
so for the non

00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,080
non-code folks which is a term we're

00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:40,159
thinking about there was a lot of

00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:41,919
discussion about terminology and

00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:43,120
and how we break things out and not make

00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:44,720
things feel like other from a

00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:46,960
contributor perspective but

00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:48,320
if you're not in an issue cue related to

00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,120
code what can you do to get your

00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:52,080
contribution

00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:52,640
recognized yeah that's a really good

00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:56,320
question

00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:57,840
so um the so today um some of this

00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:00,720
already takes place right we are

00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:01,440
tracking individual documentation edits

00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,720
for example

00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:04,559
we're tracking some of the ways that

00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:06,320
people contribute that aren't just

00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:09,279
code related and that gets built out

00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:12,159
into your drupal.org profile

00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:14,080
we can we also have folks who created

00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:15,600
community projects so people who are

00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:17,520
organizing drupal camps

00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:19,039
might create an issue queue project for

00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:20,880
their drupal camp and credit people the

00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:23,120
way that we normally do for code

00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:24,640
but what we're doing um in the months

00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:26,399
actually following drupalcon is we're

00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:29,120
sort of updating this process

00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:31,279
and making it easier to kind of record

00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:34,000
the kinds of contributions that are not

00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:35,600
code related so again documentation

00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,799
different community roles that people

00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,399
have whether it's membership in a

00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:39,039
working group a volunteer group on the

00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:41,840
board

00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:43,520
maintainership all these things um so

00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:45,840
the idea is going to be

00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:48,240
hopefully that in your in your profile

00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:51,120
you'll have a way to sort of record

00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:52,080
all of the non-drupal activities that

00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:54,080
you do

00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:55,520
um and uh and make that part of the

00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,159
conversation as well there's some

00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,519
there's some

00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:59,279
big plans around that and we talked

00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:01,200
about this a little bit uh

00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:02,559
in um heather's introduction to the

00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:04,240
dries note and a little bit in the

00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:05,200
drupal.org panel as well if you want to

00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,880
take a look at that

00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:08,960
and certainly feel free to reach out to

00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:12,320
me with your ideas i'd love to hear them

00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:14,080
as well um

00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:16,840
jumping into the next oh we have a baby

00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:19,840
on screen that's going to be a

00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:19,840
distraction

00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:39,200
uh awesome um okay we have a question

00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:40,480
here from damian that i think was

00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:43,360
related to that

00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:44,880
maintainership's um uh sustainability

00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:46,240
and succession planning conversation and

00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:48,320
this is a question we've had at

00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:49,840
drupalcon before but dries it's related

00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,960
to your sustainability and your

00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:53,279
succession planning

00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:54,720
which is have you ever thought about um

00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:56,000
you know whether you needed to step away

00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:58,559
from the d.a or from

00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,399
drupal leadership or you know what's the

00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:02,159
emergency plan if you win the lottery

00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:05,519
and decide to move to

00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:07,760
hawaii you know what do we do for to

00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:08,720
handle three succession yeah no it's a

00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:11,840
good question

00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:13,360
um first of all i have no intention to

00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:16,480
stop i love what i do

00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:18,559
i really do but um i i do

00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:19,519
think a lot about succession planning

00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:22,080
and

00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:22,799
uh you know in fact i've spent you know

00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,880
the last

00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:26,720
10 plus years trying to build out a

00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:28,799
succession plan and

00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:30,320
um because you have to remember at first

00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:32,399
they did everything

00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:34,559
you know it was literally just me from

00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:37,840
building the software to

00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:39,600
maintaining the servers um

00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:42,080
and you know like the drupal association

00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:45,200
is a big part of succession planning

00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:46,080
quite honestly right like um and then

00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:48,320
the governance

00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:50,080
on the project site too we have amazing

00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:52,080
teams and people involved we have

00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:54,640
governance documents

00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:56,640
um that is that outline how we make

00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:58,480
decisions so

00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:01,279
i don't know i feel like maybe there's

00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:03,039
more to do but i do feel like

00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:05,840
we have a lot of great things in place

00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:07,440
from core committer themes to the drupal

00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:10,000
association

00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:12,240
uh you know to kind of run the project

00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:15,840
you know i think it kind of runs

00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:18,799
uh with or without me in many ways um

00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:20,240
maybe you feel differently but um what i

00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:23,519
feel is that

00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:26,000
um the project would survive easily

00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:28,399
if i were to step away there's maybe a

00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,320
few things that need to be

00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:31,760
you know need to be dealt with or

00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:35,720
something like

00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:38,640
um but i think

00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:43,279
99.9 percent of all the decisions

00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:43,279
are made by other people they really are

00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:49,679
so i was just looking for more about it

00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:51,360
uh damian if

00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:52,960
there's specific concerns that you have

00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:55,039
it would be great conversation because

00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:57,679
i'm constantly thinking about it and

00:33:55,039 --> 00:34:00,240
trying to make steps to make drupal more

00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:03,760
and more sustainable

00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:09,039
but i can see um

00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:09,039
you know happy to talk more about it

00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:13,280
so somewhat related to that tim i wanted

00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,480
to touch on because i just got a chance

00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:16,800
to scroll through the

00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:18,720
the chat a bit and just to circle back

00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,280
to some of the conversation about board

00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:21,440
meetings so

00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:23,760
it looks like one of the main concerns

00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:26,079
is understanding our strategy

00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:27,200
and one way to do that we have a

00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:29,599
strategic plan

00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:31,200
that we put into place for 2021 for the

00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:34,159
next three years

00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:35,520
i shared those strategic focus areas in

00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:38,079
in the pre-dries note

00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:40,240
and we've got a one-pager we can share

00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:42,000
far and wide with the community

00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:43,760
so as far as like strategically where's

00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,280
the da headed we have that it's it's

00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:47,919
available to share

00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:49,919
um and then we build out the operational

00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:51,919
plan underneath that each year and and i

00:34:49,919 --> 00:34:53,119
think where that ties in to dries what

00:34:51,919 --> 00:34:56,480
you were talking about

00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:58,480
is you know i think the more that

00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:59,839
we align our strategic work with the

00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:02,000
strategic

00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:03,839
desires of the project which is how that

00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,680
strategic plan was created

00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:07,359
the more we can ensure that that what

00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:09,119
you want to see for drupal is being

00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:10,400
operationalized and supported by the

00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:12,560
work that we do

00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:14,320
um so just wanted to touch on that real

00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,960
quick from a chat perspective and hope

00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:17,200
that

00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:18,880
you know and anybody that that wants to

00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:20,400
be able to see that strategic plan we've

00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:22,560
got a one-pager i'll make sure that we

00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:23,839
get that out in a variety of forms to

00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,880
the community

00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:27,760
and that may give you a little more

00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:30,720
information as well

00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:31,440
be curious to um pull that it's probably

00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:33,119
too late to

00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:34,480
create a poll but i'd be interested to

00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:37,520
hear from the

00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:40,320
um audience the participants how

00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:41,040
they're getting their information you

00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:43,359
know like how

00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:45,359
how are they how are you hearing from

00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:46,320
the drupal association and on the drupal

00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:48,079
project

00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:49,440
is it on drupal.org is it through the

00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:51,119
newsletter is it

00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:53,440
on twitter you know like how are you

00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:54,800
getting your information

00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:56,640
because you know obviously we want to

00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:57,599
improve those communication channels and

00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:00,720
it's interesting

00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:03,760
to hear um you know what is working and

00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:03,760
what's not working

00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:12,240
so if you could add to the chat that'd

00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:15,280
be great yeah

00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:17,040
awesome um

00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:18,880
great let's see we've got a couple

00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:21,359
questions here related

00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:23,520
to um i'm going to combine these two

00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:23,520
here

00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:28,160
sorry's question so when can we do

00:36:25,839 --> 00:36:30,320
another drupalcon in india or

00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:32,480
this time i won't miss it and follow up

00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:33,920
um in the past

00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:36,160
and that having kuoni involved in

00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:37,520
drupalcon europe might be an experiment

00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:41,839
that could lead to more regional

00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:41,839
drupalcons and he knew

00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:48,320
that is definitely the long play i think

00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:51,440
the pandemic

00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:52,400
has significantly impact our ability to

00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:56,079
do that

00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:56,960
quickly right so so the the idea with

00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:59,359
quoney

00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:01,440
being able to expand our our footprint

00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:02,880
for drupal crimes is still

00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:04,880
in the works and they're still working

00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:06,960
on that but frankly we're still

00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:09,359
working with crony to make sure that the

00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:12,320
european version is successful

00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:13,760
and um i know there's there's a quoni

00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:15,119
drupalcon europe booth

00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:16,800
here this week there's a lot of

00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:19,200
community conversations about

00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:20,880
how to do that um you know the shift to

00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:23,280
virtual and we talked about this a lot

00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:25,839
last year when we were experiencing

00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:28,000
the first round of impact um it is very

00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:30,480
hard for an organization

00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,440
to make a virtual event be financially

00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:33,200
sustainable

00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:34,480
so we need a little time we need to give

00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:36,560
quoni a little time

00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:38,400
to be able to get back to in person and

00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:40,160
have the financial model that's going to

00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:41,040
work and then we'll be able to do that

00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:43,280
scaling

00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:44,880
and that expansion but you know the

00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:47,760
vision is

00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:49,440
is having more opportunity globally but

00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:51,680
i think too

00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:53,359
we can't we can't undermine the

00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:54,640
importance of all the local and regional

00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:56,000
events that happen that aren't an

00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:57,440
official drupal con

00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,119
and i think the more we can do to

00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,920
support and amplify those in the

00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:01,760
meantime

00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:03,680
might be a good bridge until we can do

00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:06,160
something that that's larger and more

00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:06,160
scalable

00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:11,490
and baddies in the chat with all the

00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:15,370
info about the drupalcon europe plan

00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:15,370
[Laughter]

00:38:16,839 --> 00:38:19,839
um

00:38:30,839 --> 00:38:33,839
folks

00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:41,440
maybe maybe you broke up a little bit

00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:43,040
for me maybe it was

00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:44,800
for others too but i think i got the

00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:47,839
question let me try and repeat it

00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:50,240
um what can we do

00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:52,480
to you know convince javascript

00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:56,320
developers from working with drupal

00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:58,400
i think was a question um

00:38:56,320 --> 00:39:00,720
i mean i think the work that we're doing

00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:03,920
around headless and decoupled

00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:05,520
um is probably the best thing we can

00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:07,920
talk about meaning

00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:09,440
um the reality is that most of the

00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:11,839
javascript developers

00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:13,680
that you know they're very limited

00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:16,000
options in terms of what content

00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:19,119
repository to work with

00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:20,800
and and they really

00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:22,400
need one very often especially if you

00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,920
have a content rich application that

00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:26,880
you're building

00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:29,119
and i think it's not widely understood

00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:29,680
how good of a content repository drupal

00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:32,240
is

00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:33,920
and the kind of richness that we have

00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:36,079
with our apis

00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:37,359
so i think one thing that you can do is

00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:40,240
is help

00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:43,599
javascript developers understand that

00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:45,280
drupal is a great content repository

00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:46,880
that can work really well with their

00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:50,480
javascript

00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:52,640
um you know code but they go you know

00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:55,359
take peanut butter and jelly they go

00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:57,440
well together versus

00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:58,720
most people's minds you know drupal is

00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,839
something that doesn't go well with

00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:02,400
javascript

00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:04,160
but it really thanks to you know years

00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,920
and years of work it actually does go

00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:08,400
well together

00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:09,119
and i think telling that story is

00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,880
important

00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:12,400
because it's not i can tell you it's not

00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:14,400
widely understood

00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:16,560
it's not the sentiment that most people

00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,560
have

00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:21,040
which is why we decided to do the

00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:23,119
decoupled menu initiative

00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:24,560
as an example because we will actually

00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:28,000
have a way of

00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:30,720
doing things that no other

00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,200
as far as i know and i've looked no

00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:34,640
other

00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:37,440
headless cms you know will have as good

00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:39,440
menu management as we will have

00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:40,800
like literally we will be the best at

00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:45,280
managing

00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:47,839
um you know the couple menus

00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:49,520
as a you know as an example right so we

00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:53,839
should really

00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:55,200
um tell that story to the world

00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:58,400
and then we should make more of those

00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:58,400
features obviously too

00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:04,079
awesome time for

00:41:04,839 --> 00:41:07,839
um

00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:23,200
so i don't know if if y'all had the same

00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:25,599
issue tim was a little roboty for me

00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:28,960
that time so i'll repeat the question

00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:30,480
um so amy said uh i love the increased

00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:32,000
scholarship and outreach program this

00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,720
year it was wonderful to meet so many

00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,640
new folks

00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:38,079
do you plan to apply a similar approach

00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:40,079
to future in-person or hybrid events

00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:42,319
so angie do you want to take that from

00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:44,160
uh from your perspective and then i can

00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:48,960
certainly layer in

00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:51,760
yeah sure um i think it's a priority um

00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:52,960
to bring in as many new people as we can

00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:56,400
and also make the

00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:59,440
event as inclusive um as we can

00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:01,359
so that means more new people

00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:03,200
people from different backgrounds so

00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:04,720
that's a priority obviously there's more

00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:07,839
of a challenge in terms of

00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:10,240
cost for bringing folks to in person

00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:13,119
because of flights and hotels so

00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:13,440
the pivot to virtual definitely helped

00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:16,560
us

00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:18,000
be able to expand the scholarship

00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:20,560
program

00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,760
from a budget standpoint more than we

00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:24,319
maybe would

00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:26,560
in person but i know that we're going to

00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:29,359
try to be as creative as possible

00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:30,000
in our budgeting for when we do

00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:33,119
eventually

00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:35,119
move to back to in person so

00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:36,240
um i think we'll we'll try to get

00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:38,640
creative and

00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:39,599
maybe offering opportunities for folks

00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:42,319
to

00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:44,079
um contribute to directly to a

00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:45,839
scholarship program or things like

00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:47,760
that um to make sure that we can

00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:50,240
continue to keep it as

00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:51,440
as big as we possibly can i know that

00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:54,800
it's it's been

00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:58,400
a really excellent um byproduct of

00:42:54,800 --> 00:43:01,839
of moving to a virtual event

00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:04,240
and and just to be

00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:06,720
completely open and honest about it in

00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:09,839
an in-person event we can typically fund

00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:12,400
10 people on a scholarship so

00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:13,920
moving to virtual it was you know

00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:16,319
there's a bit of a

00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:17,680
limitless quality to it because there we

00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:20,079
don't have that fixed

00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:21,359
cost associated and we could reach much

00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:24,160
much further

00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:24,880
so will we be at that scale i don't

00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:28,000
think so

00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:29,119
unless we have some huge fund that

00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,520
appears that

00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:33,520
that helps us with scholarships do we

00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:34,880
want to do more than 10 absolutely would

00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:37,119
i want 150

00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:38,480
people there in person absolutely we

00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:40,160
just have to figure out how to make

00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:40,960
those things happen so that's another

00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:42,880
reason

00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:45,040
that i think we can't abandon the

00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:46,800
opportunities around virtual and getting

00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:47,839
people together and sharing information

00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:50,319
altogether

00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:52,079
because we will lose the opportunity for

00:43:50,319 --> 00:43:53,119
new people to onboard into the drupal

00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:55,520
community if

00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:57,119
if we rely solely on the in-person

00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:59,280
aspect now

00:43:57,119 --> 00:44:01,359
the alternative is drupalcon is not the

00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:04,160
only way for people to connect to drupal

00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:06,480
so i'll go back to my i truly believe

00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:08,000
that the local onboarding local events

00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:10,720
the ability to connect where you

00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:12,400
live is really really really powerful

00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:14,000
and it's a way that most people get

00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,880
connected frankly to the drupal

00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,800
community

00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:19,119
so if we can take that scholarship

00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:20,560
approach and move it to a local level

00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:22,400
where the cost is going to be less

00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:23,440
prohibitive and we can scale it on a

00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:26,720
much larger

00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:28,560
scale then that may help us kind of meet

00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:30,400
both of those goals in a way that works

00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:33,200
for the community and for the da and

00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:33,200
everybody involved

00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:41,440
related to virtual events and

00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:42,800
but just go i saw some questions come

00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:45,040
through about

00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:46,880
the usage of like their virtual tools

00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:49,599
for sponsors

00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:50,000
um and i like it's it's that trade-off

00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:53,200
right like

00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:55,440
like it's very easy then to invite

00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:56,960
um you know people in to increase

00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:58,079
scholarships but it's more challenging

00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:00,079
to know okay well how

00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:01,200
how with this limited user interface can

00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:03,200
we make enough opportunities for

00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:04,720
sponsors to get visibility and find

00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:07,440
their roi

00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:09,280
um i i wonder if we might seem to even

00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:11,040
crowdsource that i'll say like

00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:12,560
i thought the coolest thing that i saw

00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:14,160
was 1x internet

00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:15,920
sponsoring kind of a hallway tracks like

00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:17,839
okay well that seems like a

00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:19,920
way to translate some aspects of the

00:45:17,839 --> 00:45:22,319
physical event to the digital event

00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:24,480
i i wonder you know if we could just

00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:25,599
solicit that feedback from the audience

00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:28,640
you know for

00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:30,319
for folks who are struggling to um

00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:32,480
you know deal with the trade-offs here

00:45:30,319 --> 00:45:33,839
going virtual but i mean

00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:37,280
hopefully next year we'll all be back

00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:41,040
together in person anyways but

00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:42,800
you never know yeah when we designed

00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:43,920
sponsor packages this year we definitely

00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:47,119
had to keep things

00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:48,960
flexible and really focus on branding

00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:51,200
and different engagement opportunities

00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:52,800
because we all know as great as it is to

00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:53,280
have a booth and sort of have a home

00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:55,040
base

00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:56,319
at a virtual event it's just not it's

00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:57,280
never going to be the same as an

00:45:56,319 --> 00:46:00,000
in-person event

00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:02,079
so you might see things like that 1x

00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:04,720
branded hallway track or

00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:05,119
um commercials playing in the live stage

00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:07,119
which
