just get started in a few

00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,759
in a few seconds i think we're about on

00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,759
time

00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:16,400
so uh welcome

00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:19,680
um this is my this is my first time

00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:23,119
uh at a

00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:25,599
north america drupalcon it's not um

00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:27,199
exactly how i imagined it was going to

00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:30,080
be but

00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:32,079
less traveling so that's good now just

00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:36,880
let's have a look bottom

00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:36,880
left slide controls for captioning

00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,079
so let's see

00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,680
i'm not seeing the options for that

00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:49,280
whether

00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,280
that i think that might be

00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:58,079
uh because does that rely on

00:00:54,399 --> 00:01:01,600
i have a feeling that relies on chrome

00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:05,360
and i am using firefox

00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:08,640
right okay i shall just carry on then

00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:12,240

i'm not speaking on behalf of the drupal

00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:05,360
security team

00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,079
um these are the you know these are my

00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,599
own

00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:11,920
opinions um and i know that

00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:13,280
i know lots of people have some quite

00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:16,319
strong opinions

00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:18,720
about um

00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:20,080
about the drupal 7 end of life and that

00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:23,360
type of thing

00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:25,200
i'm not trying to upset anyone um

00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,280
these are just you know some of my

00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:30,000
thoughts and observations

00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,760
um having spent the last little while

00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:37,840
thinking a lot about

00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:37,840
a lot about drupal 7. so

00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:45,840
drupal 7 was released

00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:49,120
um january 5th 2011

00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:52,160
and the newly

00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:55,440
uh updated end of life date is

00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:59,040
november 2022 so

00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:02,400
um it was going to be you know

00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:03,680
i guess just over 10 years with the

00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:07,040
newly extended

00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:10,000
end of life by the time that um

00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,800
end of life date comes along uh it will

00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,720
have been

00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,800
around it will have been supported i

00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:17,840
guess for 11 years

00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:21,120
10 months and some change so

00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:23,920
that's about 140 odd months

00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,560
if the release windows which happen

00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,920
every month

00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:29,120
have um you know happened consistently

00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:33,840
through that time you're looking at

00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:33,840
about 140 odd release windows there so

00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,840
um the this i'm going to talk now about

00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,959
the

00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:46,480
the state of drupal 7 as it is

00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:49,920
today so

00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:53,439
these this is looking at the last few

00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:56,560
uh releases um over the last

00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:59,120
couple of couple of years um

00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,640
we have been doing our best to keep

00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:04,000
drupal 7

00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:06,640
up to date with modern technologies

00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,879
obviously when drupal 7 was released

00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:11,680
um you were looking at sort of you know

00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:14,720
early versions of php5

00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:17,840
um and and you know

00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:20,400
my sequel five dot something i can't i

00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,199
did look this up was it five zero even

00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:24,400
but it was

00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:27,120
you know ten years ago um the the

00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,000
versions of all of the technologies uh

00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,759
involved in

00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,240
in hosting and running a drupal site

00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:34,479
where we're quite a long way back from

00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,680
from where we are today so the last

00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:39,199
couple of years

00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:42,720
um we've managed to update

00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:46,960
um drupal 7 so that you know it works on

00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:49,680
modern versions of php uh php 8.0

00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:52,160
just went out in in the the most recent

00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,800
release i don't think we

00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,479
we're not saying that it's completely

00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,919
and utterly supported and ready for

00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:59,840
production but it's

00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:02,720
close and it's ready certainly ready for

00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:06,240
testing my sequel 8 was a big

00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:08,960
um required a lot of changes was was

00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,360
you know a substantial piece of work for

00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,600
the

00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,639
for the contributors for the drupal 7

00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:16,160
contributors and

00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:17,520
and that was um that was done towards

00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:20,240
the end of last year so

00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:23,280
we're trying to keep drupal up to date

00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:25,199
drupal 7 up to date with uh

00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,960
the the sort of hosting technologies

00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:31,280
there

00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:34,560
um that means that with drupal 7 we

00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:38,720
we do our testing on drupal.org you know

00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,600
drupal ci um at the moment we have got

00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,880
drupal 7

00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:44,560
core being tested with ph as you can see

00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:48,400
here php 8

00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:51,360
uh all the way back to php 5.3

00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,160
um we do our best to make sure you know

00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:56,160
that every every

00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:59,600
commit um that goes into drupal core

00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:01,360
uh is is tested on on all of those

00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,280
versions that you see so we you know

00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,360
we're trying hard to make sure that

00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:07,120
we maintain that compatibility you can

00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,720
see there quite how many different

00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:12,240
combinations

00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:15,360
um of databases and php versions

00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:18,560
uh you can do the testing with and

00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:21,280
that's often uh you know we'll

00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:23,520
we'll certainly try and make sure that

00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:25,360
the older versions are not broken by any

00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,319
changes that go in so that means things

00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,199
like um

00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:30,800
despite the fact that we're supporting

00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:34,479
or working on php

00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:37,840
8 we still insist on using

00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:39,440
um there's there's no short array syntax

00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,319
for example is one of the big things

00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,280
often you know

00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:45,440
copy and paste code from from d8 or

00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:47,440
anything like that or people's ids often

00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,639
want to sort of convert stuff be helpful

00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,560
and convert things

00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:51,919
to shorter a syntax that's something we

00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,319
need to keep on

00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:55,919
um being vigilant about making sure

00:06:54,319 --> 00:07:00,080
we're not committing those into

00:06:55,919 --> 00:07:02,720
into drupal 7 sites we um

00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,280
fairly recently with the my sequel 8

00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:07,360
work

00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:10,080
we got sql light um tests passing

00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,599
um for drupal 7 core which was great

00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:16,080
unfortunately

00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:19,520
um i think we've got yeah sorry

00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:21,360
postgres tests do not pass at the moment

00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:23,280
you know patch is welcome on that

00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,479
i'd love to have them passing again but

00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:27,199
it's not something

00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:29,440
uh we've been able to spend uh

00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:33,360
significant time on recently

00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:33,919
and as i said php versions from 5.3 up

00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,440
till

00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:40,800
up till 8. having said that um

00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:43,840
test coverage in drupal 7 is

00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,560
is thin in some places and non-existent

00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:48,639
in others

00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:49,280
so um i think when we when we're talking

00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:52,479
about

00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:53,680
you know what we what we commit to

00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:57,520
drupal 7

00:07:53,680 --> 00:08:01,280
we definitely have to be careful uh we

00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:02,479
often insist on on tests being added for

00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,720
anything new which is

00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:05,599
you know quite normal but we also have

00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,080
to

00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:09,520
check whether um there's actually test

00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,199
coverage in place

00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,720
for some of the things that we're

00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:15,520
changing and sometimes it's

00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:17,440
it's not the case although i think seven

00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,639
improved a great deal on the test

00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,080
coverage from

00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:22,080
anything that had gone before there's

00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:24,639
still a few gaps and it's not

00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:26,240
uncommon to find you know a part of

00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:27,680
drupal 7 that we're looking at that

00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:32,000
doesn't really have very much

00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:35,440
in in by means of test coverage

00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,399
because drupal 7 was released quite so

00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,279
long ago

00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:41,680
um if you look at something like the

00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:46,959
browser requirements documentation

00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:46,959
although it was um although it was

00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,920
put together it's been updated rather

00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,160
relatively recently

00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,200
the initial you know requirements

00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:58,560
documentation

00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:00,800
for um drupal 7 talked about

00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:02,000
things like internet explorer 6 and

00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,800
various things like that

00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,440
so you know the the browsers that we

00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:10,320
support i think this is something which

00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,279
we probably could do with updating i

00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,360
don't think

00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:14,320
it's realistic to say that anyone is

00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,440
testing

00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,560
any drupal 7 changes that we work on

00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,519
these days

00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:22,160
in internet explorer 6 or anything like

00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,320
that

00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:27,360
um however you know for backwards

00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:30,080
compatibility i think we would probably

00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,399
uh be reticent to go through the list

00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,519
and

00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:34,320
and be dropping support for too much

00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:37,600
stuff but

00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:39,440
obviously it's impractical for to be

00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,200
testing on anything that was there in

00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,839
the original documentation that says

00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:46,160
drupal 7 works well on this stuff

00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:47,680
so in terms of browsers a good example

00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,839
that we came across

00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:51,120
recently or that we've just added a

00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:54,640
change for

00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:55,120
um changing browser behaviors for things

00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:58,160
like

00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:59,120
uh the same site attribute on cookies

00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:02,000
we've just

00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,440
um added some changes to drupal 7 for

00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,160
that so obviously

00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:08,000
um despite the fact the documentation

00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:11,120
looks very out of date and says

00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,320
you know that we we're focused on on ie6

00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:15,920
and things like that

00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:18,640
um we again are trying to

00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,519
update drupal 7 so that it works

00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:22,880
properly with

00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:26,800
with modern browsers

00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:30,240
um i don't know if anyone saw

00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,959
if if anyone has heard um jsxjm talk

00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:35,519
about

00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:39,360
the the security team and the drupal 8

00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:42,480
uh end of life coming up the the

00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:44,560
versions of drupal 8 and 9 i think the

00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,839
the way that they are supported and the

00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:48,399
drupal 8's

00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:49,760
kind of life cycle is largely um

00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:52,560
dictated to

00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:54,880
to an extent by dependencies and things

00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:59,040
like symphony versions and end of life

00:10:54,880 --> 00:11:01,519
of stuff like that drupal 7 um

00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,880
you know one of the big differences is

00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:05,680
it has very few

00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:07,760
kind of external dependencies but jquery

00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:11,760
is one of the big ones that we

00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:13,920
we did um include a version of jquery

00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,279
and the version of jquery which which

00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:17,800
still

00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:19,279
ships with drupal 7 core is this one

00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:21,279
1.4.4

00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:22,320
which as you can see there was released

00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:25,920
you know november

00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:29,279
2010 so a pretty long time ago

00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:31,040
um jquery have not been they they

00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:34,399
haven't had a very clear

00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:35,440
uh documented kind of uh software life

00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:38,399
cycle

00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,279
policy but um you know questions have

00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:42,399
been asked

00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:44,079
in in the public forums it is uh

00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:45,440
you know it seems fairly obvious okay

00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:48,880
the version that

00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:51,120
drupal 7 is on 1.4.4 um

00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:52,880
is almost certainly end of life j the

00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,240
jquery maintainers have actually

00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,000
confirmed yes

00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,519
that you know there isn't a sort of

00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,600
scheduled date when

00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:00,639
older versions necessarily went end of

00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:04,480
life but yes

00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:06,480
um j crew one point x and two point x

00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,079
uh are not being maintained anymore so

00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,120
this is kind of one of the challenges

00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:13,040
with keeping

00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:14,560
drupal 7 up to date and particularly

00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:17,600
with keeping it secure

00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:21,279
um jquery update

00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:25,200
is a a very popular module in drupal 7

00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:26,079
it allows um allows drupal 7 sites to

00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,320
use

00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:30,240
more up-to-date versions of jquery than

00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,399
the one that core shipped with

00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:34,240
but there are some complications there

00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:37,360
about what versions

00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,600
um jquery update actually shipped with

00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,720
the

00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:44,560
you know the version uh that was

00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:46,560
um the the the the released version of

00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:49,040
drupal of jquery

00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,000
update which has the drupal security

00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,920
coverage

00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,079
itself is very old now you know it's

00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:56,240
about five years old so

00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:58,000
um it doesn't have particularly

00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:01,360
up-to-date modern versions of

00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,040
of jquery in it so um

00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:06,399
i think that's one of the challenges of

00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:09,040
keeping uh jquery secure of keeping

00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:11,360
drupal 7 sorry secure and up to date

00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:13,440
uh jquery is certainly one of those and

00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:15,120
i think you know anyone who looks i've

00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,720
having worked in the drupal security

00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:19,920
team for a few years

00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:22,000
um several of the recent core updates

00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:24,320
we've done in drupal 7 have involved

00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,680
essentially back porting

00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:29,519
fixes for jquery to the various versions

00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:32,560
that we're trying to support

00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:35,680
so i you know i have

00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:37,680
i have uh some ideas about

00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,720
how i would like to improve the

00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:41,040
situation

00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,399
in terms of jquery updating the versions

00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:45,519
of jquery

00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:46,720
um which are supported and that's

00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:50,240
something that you know

00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:53,360
i want to kind of steer um

00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,839
drupal 7 in in the right direction uh so

00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:57,040
that

00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:58,959
as we near the end of life of the

00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,880
project and we'll we'll talk about

00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:02,320
exactly what that means in a short while

00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,720
but that um

00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,920
you know the the sites that are that are

00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:09,120
running drupal 7

00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:12,000
are in as robust uh

00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:14,639
a um situation as possible with with

00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,120
things like jquery

00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:17,839
so we've we've had a release schedule a

00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,680
public

00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:20,880
uh published release schedule for the

00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:24,079
last

00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:28,560
a couple of years we we try and follow

00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:31,760
um the the same uh release window

00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:34,160
as drupal 8 and 9 we

00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:36,560
we broadly have released um a version of

00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:39,600
drupal 7 every six months which

00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:40,320
i know some people uh would really like

00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:44,959
us to be

00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:47,040
releasing more regularly than that

00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:49,199
every six months is all that i think we

00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:51,760
can really commit to regularly

00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:53,360
um for the foreseeable future what that

00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:56,880
actually means is that

00:14:53,360 --> 00:15:00,160
you know with the end of life um in

00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:02,480
november 2022 there's

00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:04,240
potentially maybe only about four more

00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:07,760
bug fix releases there

00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:10,000
in the schedule um so any changes

00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:12,160
that people are desperate to get in

00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,399
before that end of life date

00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:15,440
uh the clocks ticking in terms of if you

00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:18,720
want to you know

00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:20,160
contribute and um get your get your

00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:23,279
patches reviewed and

00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:26,320
committed um

00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:27,519
so talking about who cares about drupal

00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,920
7 i would say you know

00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:31,600
the maintainers definitely care very

00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:33,920
much about drupal 7

00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,680
and we have to be really careful when we

00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:38,639
are making changes

00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:40,800
uh on the basis of the fact that i think

00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:43,920
if you contrast it to

00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:45,199
to drupal 8 and 9 some of the some of

00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:47,600
the changes that we've worked on

00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:50,800
recently like the my sequel 8

00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:53,120
um support

00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:55,360
some of the changes that we made there

00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,800
the the drupal 8 and 9 maintainers

00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:59,360
decided that it was

00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:00,320
too risky too significant to make some

00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,079
of the changes

00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,839
in the versions of drupal 8 which was

00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:06,240
supported there and they

00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:08,160
only make the really dramatic changes in

00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,880
the newer versions in drupal 9 because

00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,639
obviously the

00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,800
you know the minor releases are rolling

00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:14,320
all the time um

00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,240
and they've been able to handle it that

00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:18,959
way we don't we because

00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:20,160
drupal 7 just has you know a simpler

00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:22,800
structure and we're just

00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:24,000
we're committing to to the 7.x branch

00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:27,199
all of the time

00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,800
we we have to decide on you know are we

00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:30,720
are we going to commit it or not we

00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:33,839
sometimes have to think about

00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:35,839
our um our change is going to be

00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:38,480
enabled by default sometimes we make

00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:39,199
them enabled by default only for new

00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,560
sites

00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:43,519
and have them as opt-in for existing

00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:46,000
sites because what

00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:47,040
we really focus on you know the

00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,959
stability of

00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,399
of all of the many sites which are

00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:52,000
already out there running

00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:53,519
the software and people don't want

00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,720
unpleasant surprises with the new

00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:56,320
release if we

00:16:54,720 --> 00:17:00,079
if we make sort of dramatic and

00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:00,079
unnecessary changes let's say

00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:04,319
um the way we've been working for the

00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:08,480
last little while

00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:08,880
uh is using meta issues in on d.o so

00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,079
this

00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:13,600
this is an example of the one from from

00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:14,880
a recent release we kind of just give

00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:18,000
ourselves a big

00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:21,039
to-do list and try and work through

00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:24,000
as much of it as we can um as we

00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:24,000
as we go along

00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:29,280
i would say that hopefully you know we'd

00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:32,480
encourage

00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:34,480
um anyone who's interested in the way

00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,240
that drupal so in any changes that are

00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:38,960
being made to drupal 7

00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,400
um to come along and participate in

00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:43,440
those issues you can

00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:45,520
you can you know lobby us to

00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:47,280
to prioritize the changes that you care

00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:50,240
about and if you see us

00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:51,679
working on a change or a patch which is

00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:54,640
going to cause a problem

00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:56,480
for your drupal 7 site then obviously

00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,880
it's ideal

00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:00,400
for us to find out about that while

00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,320
we're actually working on the patch

00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,200
which we do in public here in these

00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:05,200
issues

00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,880
uh rather than finding out you know a

00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,480
week after we've done the release and

00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:11,600
and people kind of

00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:13,919
uh you know come out of uh

00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,960
uh to their silence and tell us that

00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:18,000
we've broken

00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:21,440
loads of websites so if you if you run

00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:24,880
a lot of drupal 7 sites uh and you

00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:27,039
you're interested in in their

00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:28,000
stability then you know i'd encourage

00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:30,640
you to come and

00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,039
participate in the issue queues and and

00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,799
test

00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:34,799
stuff before it gets committed and

00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:36,240
released into the into the drupal 7

00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:38,320
versions

00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,600
i'm going to go quickly in this section

00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,760
um

00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,799
who uses drupal 7 i don't think this is

00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:46,000
an easy question

00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:48,320
to answer so we've there are some

00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:51,760
statistics obviously drupal

00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:54,160
doesn't have uh you know

00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:55,360
it doesn't have telemetry in it which

00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:57,760
which kind of

00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:59,440
gives away lots of detailed information

00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:01,120
about exactly who

00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,960
what's what sites are running it where

00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,919
they are what type of sites they are all

00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,840
that sort of thing

00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:07,600
this usage information that we have on

00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:10,559
on drupal.org is about

00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:11,200
the best information that we have to go

00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:15,520
on

00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:18,080
um it suggests at present that there are

00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:20,559
you know maybe around a million uh

00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:22,080
drupal sites in total and about 60

00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:25,679
percent or let's say

00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:26,480
two-thirds of them um are still drupal

00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:30,000
seven

00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:32,240
uh this will not be accurate

00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,080
lots of the sites there you know might

00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,559
not be production sites you might get

00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:37,679
lots of

00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:39,120
uh dev and staging sites phoning home to

00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:40,799
ddo with the

00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:43,600
with the update module which is where

00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:46,559
this um where these statistics come from

00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:47,840
and i think it also will really under

00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:50,640
report the numbers

00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:51,520
for uh for drupal 8 and 9 which tend not

00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,760
to be

00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:55,919
you know they're much more likely to be

00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,880
run in a different way using composer

00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:58,640
and

00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,000
just totally different workflows so i

00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,919
think it's it's

00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,760
not likely that these are particularly

00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:06,960
accurate statistics but they're

00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:09,280
about as accurate as we they're

00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:10,880
among the best stats that we actually

00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:12,159
have so that's suggesting you know it's

00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:15,679
an overall number

00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:16,240
over half a million um drupal 7 websites

00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:19,440
still

00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:20,559
you can look at other stats from

00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:24,600
elsewhere

00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:27,679
um so you know looking at

00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:30,880
builtwith.com or w3tx

00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:32,880
these are suggesting you know not not

00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:34,080
vastly dissimilar numbers to what we

00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,480
just looked at but but

00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:38,240
a bit different they one of those sites

00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:40,320
for example is suggesting six hundred

00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:42,559
thousand odd drupal sites

00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:44,320
and about half of them so you know fifty

00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:46,880
percent half instead of

00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:49,120
um two thirds of those still being on

00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,840
drupal 7. so i mean it looks like a lot

00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:52,960
of

00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:54,400
uh drupal sites are still on on drupal

00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:57,039
7.

00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:58,320
who uses who uses drupal 7 if there are

00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:59,919
as many you know if there are still

00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:01,120
hundreds of thousands of drupal 7

00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:04,480
websites out there

00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:04,880
who who uses it what's the typical d7

00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,480
site

00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:08,480
again i don't think you can really

00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:10,960
answer this you have to forgive my

00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:12,640
my very poor graphic design skills i

00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:14,640
thought i'll put one or two

00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,679
book covers in here to to kind of

00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:18,000
illustrate

00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:19,520
the the the broad church the diversity

00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,880
of different drupal 7 sites and there

00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,960
were actually there were so many of them

00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:26,159
i was quite surprised and my

00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:28,240
my graphics skills certainly

00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:29,440
weren't up to making a brilliant image

00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:32,720
here but i think

00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:35,760
um who uses drupal 7

00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:38,799
small sites maybe use drupal 7

00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:41,360
more than than you know it's been said

00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:42,320
uh then would be the case for for newer

00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:44,799
versions

00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:45,760
uh it's common i think to have drupal 7

00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:49,120
being used to

00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:52,159
run collections of lots of small sites

00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:54,400
um publishing has always been a popular

00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:56,840
sector as the you know public sector

00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:59,679
government education

00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:02,080
um communities i think in the list that

00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:05,919
we looked at before it's quite common

00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:08,320
for uh you know big sites big companies

00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:10,080
to have their sort of developer portals

00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:11,440
or their support portals running on

00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:15,039
drupal 7.

00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:15,520
um drupal.org is a good example of a

00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:17,760
site

00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:19,600
that runs drupal 7 and it still runs

00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:21,919
drupal 7

00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:23,120
and there are lots of others so i don't

00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:25,200
think i've got anything

00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:26,960
particularly insightful to say about all

00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:30,400
of that but it a lot of

00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:33,919
different um you know people different

00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:37,520
uh use cases for for drupal 7.

00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:40,320
who's who's contributing to drupal 7 or

00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:43,360
who does contribute to drupal 7 now

00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:46,400
the drupal security team still

00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:48,400
contributes to drupal 7 still you know

00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:50,480
cares about drupal 7 spends a lot of

00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:53,919
time reviewing

00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:55,520
uh contrib issues for drupal 7 and also

00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:56,080
spends a lot of time looking at drupal

00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:59,600
core

00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:03,360
stuff for drupal 7. the drush

00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:07,280
maintainers still uh contributing

00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:09,760
um the drush 8 is still

00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:11,360
uh having you know new releases

00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:14,880
published largely

00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:16,559
in order to to keep um support there for

00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:18,720
drupal 7 so you know

00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:19,840
definitely recognize the the

00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:22,159
contribution that

00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:23,600
the drush maintainers are still doing

00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:25,440
contrib maintainers

00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:27,679
lots of people will tell you you know in

00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:31,600
drupal 7 contrib has really

00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:33,120
slowed down a lot a lot of contributor

00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:35,039
contrib maintainers aren't that

00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:36,000
interested in their in the drupal 7

00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:38,799
versions of modules

00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,799
anymore but uh if you actually look at a

00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:43,360
lot of the very commonly used

00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:44,000
modules there there are still quite a

00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,720
lot of

00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,159
releases going on um for the for the

00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,840
important modules so

00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:52,640
that's great there's a lot of country

00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:54,799
maintainers still contributing to it

00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:57,200
um individual contributors and

00:23:54,799 --> 00:24:00,320
organizations contributing to

00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:02,400
drupal 7. i would say

00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:04,320
in terms of you know my own experience

00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:06,400
of working on drupal 7

00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:08,559
the number of actual contributions on

00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:10,080
drupal 7 core issues the number of

00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:13,520
contributors

00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:16,559
has got pretty small um

00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:18,960
there's probably you know around a dozen

00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:19,840
people who i think you know names that

00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:22,400
regularly crop

00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:24,240
up that will review issues and file new

00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:26,799
issues and help it's probably literally

00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:28,720
as small as that so i think um

00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:31,440
in terms of if we're still looking at

00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:33,360
hundreds of thousands of sites

00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:35,760
running drupal 7 and people do still

00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:36,320
care about it and want it to continue to

00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,080
be

00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:39,520
stable and well maintained i feel like

00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:42,080
there's quite a big

00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:43,919
silent majority there who are really

00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,880
relying on quite a small number of

00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:47,279
people

00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:49,039
to continue all this work here so this

00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:49,520
is you know sort of call to action if

00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:51,600
you

00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,960
are running drupal 7 sites and care

00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:55,919
about them um

00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:56,320
we'd love to see you uh helping out with

00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:57,760
the

00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:59,840
with the the maintenance work and

00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:04,159
contributing to drupal 7 as it's

00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:06,000
ongoing um this was very difficult to do

00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:09,279
a good job of but here's a

00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:11,760
a word cloud of of contributors

00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:14,559
from the get log to drupal 7 since

00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:15,360
drupal 8 was released in november 2015

00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:17,279
so this is

00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,559
you know roughly the last five years or

00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:20,240
so um

00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:21,600
i think from memory there's you know

00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,960
four or five hundred different

00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:26,000
contributors

00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:28,720
uh in that list so

00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:31,200
um there we go thank you very much to

00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:31,200
all of those

00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:35,039
uh right so some of the difficult

00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:38,080
questions why don't why don't

00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:40,159
drupal 7 sites upgrade

00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:41,120
the you'll you'll have lots and lots of

00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:44,720
talks

00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:46,559
this um this conference and you won't

00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:48,799
find it difficult if you want to talk to

00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:49,919
somebody about upgrading your drupal 7

00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:52,000
site to

00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:53,919
to drupal 9 presumably now i don't think

00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,960
you'll find it difficult to find someone

00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:56,799
who

00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:58,320
will be happy to talk to you about doing

00:25:56,799 --> 00:26:01,279
it um

00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:03,200
you know there's lots of uh tools and

00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:03,919
projects around about doing the the

00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,880
migration

00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:08,799
up to drupal 9 and there's lots of

00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:10,400
consultancies and agencies who

00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:12,000
will be very happy to talk to you about

00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,840
it but why aren't people

00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,919
want more people doing it what's the

00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:19,120
reasons that people don't

00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:21,039
um you know not saying anything new

00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:22,960
uh dries mentioned this i think in his

00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:25,120
in his dress note the other day but

00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:27,039
you know seven to eight is more like a

00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:29,919
rebuild than an update

00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:30,400
and obviously the story is that uh uh

00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:32,799
you know

00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:34,320
eight to nine and onwards is going to be

00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:36,400
a much um

00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:38,000
smoother transition and a smoother

00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,440
update um which

00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,679
you know hopefully that that will be

00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,640
great but obviously there are lots of

00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:46,000
people who are kind of

00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:49,200
you know feel stuck on on seven and and

00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,320
not not prepared to update eight because

00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:53,279
it's essentially

00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:54,000
you know rebuilding the whole site ten

00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:57,440
years

00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,240
um as we're looking at now is a lot of

00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:01,760
time

00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:02,960
to uh have invested in a drupal 7 site

00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:05,520
and you know perhaps it

00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:07,120
there are sites maybe drupal.org would

00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:08,799
be an example of it which may have

00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:11,919
started out you know as

00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:13,919
drupal 5 drupal 6 drupal 7 updates and

00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:17,200
then that might be 10 years

00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:18,480
worth of uh you know custom code and all

00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,640
these clever

00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,679
systems that people have built around it

00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:24,240
and

00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:26,640
it's just difficult to you know that

00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:28,720
that represents a lot of inertia for a

00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:32,399
lot of organizations where they've

00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:34,880
they've built this you know big

00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:35,679
machine essentially around drupal 7 and

00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,520
and

00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:39,760
there's been enough time now to invest

00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:41,600
an awful lot of development in that

00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:42,880
uh and it makes it very difficult

00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:44,799
actually to to just

00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:46,159
you know make clean break and do a

00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:49,360
rebuild

00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:50,320
um some of the projects another thing

00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:52,399
just to mention

00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:54,159
uh some of the the projects that were

00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:57,360
very commonly used in

00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:58,320
drupal 7 uh didn't haven't really ever

00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:01,039
fully made it

00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:02,080
up to to you know to drupal 8 and drupal

00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:04,320
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:05,840
releases again i don't want to upset

00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:09,120
anyone suggesting that

00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:11,840
uh um you know the the

00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:13,760
the projects never never got all the way

00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:16,080
there but two examples that

00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:17,440
i've had mentioned to me when doing the

00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,799
research for this are things like the

00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:21,039
rules module

00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:23,279
and organic groups there's probably

00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:25,279
replacements for those

00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:27,760
but you know i certainly i've heard

00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:29,279
people say that it's one of the reasons

00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,960
that they're you know their whole site

00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:33,039
is built on og

00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:35,360
or something like that and there's it

00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:37,520
would be you know

00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:38,960
again you know a rebuild to do all the

00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:42,399
same stuff to do it all

00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:43,840
into drupal 8 instead so again

00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:45,600
i think you know lots of people will

00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:46,000
have very different opinions about all

00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,799
of that

00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,760
um i'm going to move on though so what

00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:53,600
happens

00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:58,159
after um the end of life

00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:59,760
so this is the end of support

00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:01,760
the end of life date is the end of

00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:05,919
support from drupal.org

00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:07,919
and the drupal association for drupal 7.

00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:10,159
so that will mean things like we talked

00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:12,880
about drupal ci

00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:14,159
and the testing infrastructure um

00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:17,440
effectively will

00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:19,440
will go away so uh i will

00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:21,200
i will go into a tiny bit more detail

00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:22,880
about that in a minute but it also

00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:25,840
another change will mean that the drupal

00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:29,039
security team will no longer be

00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:33,279
you know accepting submissions uh

00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:36,559
about drupal 7 directly

00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:40,320
and won't be making um

00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:42,960
contrable core releases for for drupal

00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:43,919
7 anymore so this is one of the things i

00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:46,960
just wanted to

00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:49,440
you know to give people a bit of um

00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:50,320
of detail about the way that this works

00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:53,760
at the moment

00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:56,640
uh the drupal 6 long term support

00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:58,559
vendors there's an overlap there

00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,880
deliberately with the drupal security

00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:00,559
team

00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:03,760
and when the drupal security team

00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:04,720
receives um a report of a vulnerability

00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:07,520
let's say

00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:09,440
in core or in a contributed project they

00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:10,240
will look at it and say okay does this

00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:12,159
affect

00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:14,240
the versions that we cover does it does

00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:16,000
it affect drupal 7 drupal 8

00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:18,240
and that's at that point that drew

00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,000
drupal 6 long term support vendors have

00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:23,440
an opportunity to say

00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:25,679
okay and also does this affect drupal 6

00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:27,279
and we also try and collaborate and work

00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:30,799
well with it with the backdrop

00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:33,600
team so when something affects

00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:34,399
uh backdrop as well uh we you know we

00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:37,440
try and

00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:38,480
collaborate on that front so what

00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:41,120
happens

00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:42,960
uh once we go into drupal 7 extended

00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:44,799
support

00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:46,399
well the the drupal security team will

00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:49,200
only be receiving

00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:50,080
uh vulnerability reports at that point

00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,760
for

00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:53,440
uh it was pointed out to me earlier on

00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:55,520
not even drupal 8 because it will be

00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:58,559
past the end of life for drupal 8

00:30:55,520 --> 00:31:01,760
but drupal 9 and drupal 10 um

00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:04,960
reports so the drupal 7

00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:07,039
extended support maintainers will then

00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:08,559
be in that same position as drupal 6

00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:09,440
long term support they will have that

00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:11,200
overlap

00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:13,200
and they will say okay well does this

00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:16,320
does this affect drupal 7

00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:17,919
and d6 lts maintainers as

00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:19,360
long as that goes we'll still be looking

00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:21,600
at okay does it affect

00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:22,880
drupal 6 but what i think is likely to

00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:25,120
happen is you know

00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,919
there's there's less likely to be that

00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:29,200
overlap

00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:32,720
where um reports for

00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:35,679
uh drupal drupal 9 even projects

00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:37,120
uh actually apply to drupal 7 because

00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:39,279
you know the code is

00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:41,039
is often quite dramatically different

00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:42,159
whereas there's more of an obvious

00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:45,039
overlap when

00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:46,480
a problem is found in drupal 7 you know

00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:48,240
the drupal 6

00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:50,240
long term support vendors have been able

00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:53,039
to sort of uh

00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:54,880
piggyback on that benefit from okay

00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:56,960
these reports are often relevant to

00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:59,279
drupal 6. this is less likely to be the

00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:01,039
case i think in you know in my opinion

00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:03,200
with reports going into the drupal

00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:07,200
security team as they're not

00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:10,480
not um actually uh you know

00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:11,760
uh looking to have drupal 7 reports made

00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:13,519
to them it's it's

00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:15,600
i think going to be less and less likely

00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:17,440
that the reports made the security team

00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:19,600
actually will be relevant to drupal 7

00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:22,320
anymore so that's just you know a slight

00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:23,440
an element of risk i think in terms of

00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:27,039
what happens after

00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:28,880
after the end of life so i'm going over

00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:31,600
time a bit here i need to

00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:33,600
i want to get through these last few

00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,000
points about preparing for the end of

00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:37,200
life

00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,720
so if you still run drupal 7 sites what

00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,679
do i think you should do to try and

00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:42,640
prepare

00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:44,559
for this end of life date i think

00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:46,080
compatibility with up-to-date versions

00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:49,600
of php in my sequel

00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:53,600
would be great i think once you go into

00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:54,480
extended support as i mentioned the

00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,559
drupal

00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:57,760
drupal.org infrastructure will not be

00:32:56,559 --> 00:33:01,440
there

00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:04,559
and you know the people backporting

00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:05,679
uh security fixes for example into into

00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:08,559
drupal 7

00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:11,840
are much less likely to be inclined to

00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:12,880
test things on on php 5.3 let's say or

00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:14,880
whatever

00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:17,039
so i think you you would be in a much

00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:18,880
better position if if at the end of life

00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:22,159
your drupal 7 sites

00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:24,000
run well and run run on up-to-date

00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:27,200
versions of php and my

00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,720
sequel um i don't i don't think you

00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,080
could be too surprised if you're running

00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:31,039
on really old versions of those

00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:33,120
technologies if

00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:35,279
if something like a patch that's

00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:36,720
published in the extended support period

00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:39,360
afterwards

00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:41,120
breaks your site um because it it's

00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:42,320
unlikely it will be tested on the old

00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:45,600
versions

00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:50,159
um i think you should go through uh

00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:53,200
contrib modules dependencies libraries

00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:54,159
you know audit what's there uh how well

00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:56,720
maintained

00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:59,440
is it do you actually need it if there's

00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:02,159
a contrib module for a part of your site

00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:04,480
that nobody really uses anymore uh you

00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:06,640
know the most secure code is code that's

00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:07,919
that's deleted essentially so if you

00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:09,760
don't need

00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:11,679
if you can go through and get rid of a

00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:12,399
bunch of country modules your site will

00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:15,200
be

00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:15,520
in a better position uh for end of life

00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:18,240
so

00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:20,079
you know take the opportunity to do do

00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:22,000
some some aggressive

00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:24,000
spring cleaning there i would say if you

00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,720
can and the same with dependencies and

00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,720
libraries

00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:28,079
so yeah uninstall them if you can if you

00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:30,320
really rely on them

00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:31,200
i would you know again encourage you to

00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:33,119
try and

00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:36,240
to contribute and to help maintain those

00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:39,359
those projects and get them in

00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:40,800
good shape um as we approach the

00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:42,800
end-of-life date in terms of their

00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:44,800
compatibility and their security and all

00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:47,919
that type of thing

00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:49,520
um if you don't already have a web

00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:50,240
application firewall in front of your

00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:53,520
drupal 7

00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:54,159
site and and you can intend to continue

00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,079
it running

00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:58,000
after the end of life i would recommend

00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:59,680
that you put a web application firewall

00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,000
in front of your drupal 7 site

00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:03,520
you know even if it's um cloud flares

00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,400
free one or something like that just

00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:07,920
give you

00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:08,960
more of an opportunity to defend the

00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:11,600
site against

00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:12,880
um known or unknown attacks

00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:16,480
[Music]

00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:17,680
in the future just generally locking the

00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:19,599
site down this this

00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:20,960
it really wouldn't apply to all everyone

00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:23,680
but it may apply to

00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:25,119
a few sites that are still on d7 if they

00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:28,079
need to stay around

00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:29,440
if you can turn them into a static

00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:30,880
archive and that might just mean you

00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:33,760
know spidering the whole site

00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:34,720
chucking it up on a static html which is

00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:37,520
very

00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:39,280
secure um that would be great if you

00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:40,960
need to keep on making updates to the

00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:42,800
site maybe have your actual

00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:44,640
live site running you know somewhere

00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:46,160
away off the public internet

00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:48,079
if you only need to make occasional

00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:50,880
updates to it update it there

00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:53,200
update the static archive push it all up

00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:56,000
to the you know to the public site

00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:57,440
and that's just a you know defensive

00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,079
position that you could take

00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:01,839
to to avoid having past end of life

00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:02,800
software out up up on the public

00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:05,280
internet which

00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:07,280
from a security point of view may be

00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:09,920
considered inadvisable

00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:11,680
um follow what's going on as we get

00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:13,520
towards the end of life follow what's

00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:17,200
going on in the issue queues

00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:20,320
and community discussion um

00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:22,079
so you know try and uh if if there are

00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:25,119
announcements being made

00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:27,359
uh about what's going on with drupal 7

00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:30,560
try and keep up with those

00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:32,160
um evaluate the drupal 7 extended

00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:34,960
support

00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:36,240
program there are multiple vendors

00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:38,079
offering that

00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:40,000
have a have a good look at them decide

00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:43,359
whether it's a good fit for you

00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:45,359
uh it seems to me ill-advised

00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:46,400
to carry on with the drupal 7 site

00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:49,839
without

00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:53,680
um working with with an extended support

00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:54,160
maintainer and their provider and there

00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:56,079
but there

00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:58,240
and there are several to choose from

00:36:56,079 --> 00:37:01,280
evaluate backdrop as well you know it's

00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:04,400
it may be a a an option for you

00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:05,440
um to keep to to migrate to from your

00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:08,000
drupal 7 site

00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:09,599
and obviously evaluate migrating to to

00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,680
drupal 9

00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:13,520
make a plan for the site don't just you

00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:14,320
know put your fingers in your ears and

00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:16,240
hope for the best

00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:18,960
beyond end of life i think is what i'm

00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:21,440
saying there so

00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:22,480
okay i had to rush through the last

00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:25,520
little bit there

00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:27,599
thank you very much um just a

00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:29,359
light-hearted moment there this is a

00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:32,640
picture here of a tree house

00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:33,520
in uh west wales where i wrote some of

00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:36,640
this talk

00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:38,720
um uh last week and just thought it

00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:40,720
would be a fun thing to share with you

00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:42,400
a couple of those slides at least were

00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:45,040
uh were dreamt up from that

00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:45,839
from that tree house okay thanks very

00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:48,800
much for your time

00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:49,280
uh sorry for going a little bit over

00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:51,920
there

00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:54,640
um let's have a quick look and see if

00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:57,760
there's a question or two that i can

00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:59,520
address but it looks like i can see um

00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:02,480
you know just some discussion has been

00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:05,760
going on there in in the chat anyway so

00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:07,040
let's see should jquery update be moved

00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:10,079
to drupal 7 core

00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:13,280
uh from damian that's a good question uh

00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:14,960
and yeah i i have

00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:16,320
some opinions about what's going to

00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:19,280
happen on that front

00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:21,520
uh there is some discussion about it

00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:23,520
happening in public issue queues

00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:26,079
uh and i would say you know that's where

00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:28,960
we can we can continue to have those

00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:30,000
discussions but i would i would like the

00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:33,200
situation

00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:34,880
with jquery update to change and i would

00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,680
like by the time we get to the end of

00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:38,240
life

00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:39,839
i would like the situation to be to be

00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:42,880
better more sustainable

00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:45,920
than i think it is now so uh and

00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:48,000
sorry just one more question there um

00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:48,960
up-to-date versions of php in my sequel

00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,400
for d7

00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:52,240
i think i'd mention right at the

00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:53,760
beginning uh we

00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:56,320
the the version numbers are now

00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:57,040
overtaken drupal 7's own version number

00:38:56,320 --> 00:39:00,400
and

00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:00,960
we have at least initial support for php

00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:03,440
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:04,079
and my sequel 8. so hopefully that's

00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:07,920
kind of

00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:10,079
you know buying buying time in terms of

00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:11,200
drupal being compatible with the

00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:14,800
technologies that

00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:16,240
uh that will that will be supported for

00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:19,440
longer so

00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:21,359
okay i am going to wind up there then

00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:27,440
thank you very much everyone for coming

00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:27,440
