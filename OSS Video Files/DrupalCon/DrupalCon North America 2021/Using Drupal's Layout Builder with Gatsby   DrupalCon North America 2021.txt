hi

00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,400
everyone thank you so much for joining

00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,880
this lightning talk

00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,640
uh we'll just get started in a probably

00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,279
about 30 seconds i know we just have 10

00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,640
minutes

00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:23,519
so we'll start right on

00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,240
the clock so thank you for joining the

00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:26,160
session so

00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,920
i'll be giving a quick lightning talk on

00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,519
a drupal plus cat speed right

00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:33,280
and i'll focus on a particular aspect

00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:35,760
of using drupal's layout builder so

00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:38,399
layout builder is a very powerful

00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,960
tool that was introduced in uh drupal 8

00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,840
core

00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,280
right and it's a very handy tool for

00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,200
site builders as well as content

00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:48,239
creators to be able to

00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,360
create new landing pages dynamically it

00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:51,199
allows you to create

00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,039
a different section of the page you can

00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:56,399
create different regions dynamically and

00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:58,320
configure components and it's it's

00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:00,160
a very commonly used tool when you're

00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,600
using a traditional drupal site

00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,400
uh but i don't think a lot of people

00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,640
have tried using the layout builder with

00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,080
uh decouple implementation and

00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,000
especially with

00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:12,479
uh something like gatsby on the front

00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
end which is a static site generator

00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:16,320
uh right so i'll give you a quick demo

00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,759
of

00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:21,280
how we've done that i have posted a few

00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:22,880
links here in the chat as well

00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,720
since we just have 10 minutes i've

00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,400
posted a few links in the chat which you

00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,960
can check out later on

00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,439
uh they there are some more demos in

00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,840
there

00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:32,880
uh which you can watch in youtube as

00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,400
well as uh

00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,799
some more information about the easy

00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:39,600
content drupal distribution right uh

00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,479
it's an open source distribution that is

00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,439
maintaining

00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:45,119
uh with the focus on providing

00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:46,799
integration such as

00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:48,479
the layout builder with decoupled

00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,159
projects and

00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:51,520
that is what i would use for today's

00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:55,920
demo so i have

00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:57,520
a drupal 8 website here set up using the

00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,320
easy content distribution this is the

00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,200
back end

00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,920
and what i also have here is we have a

00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,200
front end

00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:07,759
application hosted on gatsby cloud uh so

00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,319
i will show you how i can create a new

00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:12,400
page

00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:14,400
on the drupal backend and

00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,640
let me get into that right now so i'm

00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,640
going to go to add content

00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,800
we have a content type here in the

00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:23,440
sandbox site called landing page

00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,160
so this is a very basic uh content type

00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,480
you can see

00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,599
it has just a couple of fields in the

00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:31,760
backend

00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:34,959
and let's create a page for

00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:36,239
the demo today and

00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:38,239
the integration is not just for the

00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:41,760
layout builder so you know you can also

00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:42,480
uh you can you know preview unpublished

00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,239
content

00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,760
that works here as well but i'm just

00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:47,360
going to publish it directly since we

00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,840
have limited time

00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,440
so it follows your workflow if you have

00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,800
a scheduler enabled it works with

00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,959
scheduling as well so you can schedule

00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,200
this content to be published later on

00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:59,840
you can even control the url on your

00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:03,519
gatsby site from here so

00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:06,959
let's just say that's p landing page

00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:07,680
demo so i'm giving a custom url alias

00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:10,640
here as well

00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,680
and i'm gonna hit save and this will

00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,319
bring up the

00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,120
uh layout builder interface that drupal

00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,640
provides

00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:20,319
right so you can see it's completely

00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:22,159
empty right now and

00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:23,840
i click on layout it shows me the

00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:25,680
interface so

00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,959
uh i'll take a pause here because i've

00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,560
just created this page and i'm going to

00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:29,519
show you how the integration with gadget

00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,239
cloud works

00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:34,959
so if i go to my gatsby cloud

00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:36,879
application here you can see that

00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:38,720
we just got a new build that was created

00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:40,080
in about seven seconds right so

00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:42,239
this is completely integrated with

00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,480
incremental uh

00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:45,599
integration incremental deployment with

00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,680
gatsby so

00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:50,080
only the page that i create or change

00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,280
gets rebuilt in in the gatsby cloud

00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,760
so you can see this new page is

00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,360
available and before i

00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,720
open that page on gatsby and show you

00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,159
how the preview works let's add some

00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,000
content to this page

00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:02,159
so using the layout builder i can add

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,680
some components let's say i want to add

00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:06,799
a hero media block here

00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:12,000
so let's just say let's be demo

00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:12,000
hero let's quickly select a background

00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,840
image

00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:21,359
and let's give some more text here

00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,400
right so you can see this is a custom

00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,080
block built in drupal

00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,919
which is being added by the layout

00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,880
builder you can have of course different

00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:33,120
kind of fields on

00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:35,199
uh your custom blog this one has a bunch

00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,520
of different configurations like you can

00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,800
uh add a cta here you can change the

00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,320
positioning of the text i'm just gonna

00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,040
make it center line

00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,600
it also lets you change the background

00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,680
color

00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,720
uh of the hero you can control the

00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,440
opacity

00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,919
so typical site building features that

00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,000
you might

00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:52,960
expose to your content creators in a

00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,040
drupal site

00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,000
uh you can do that and all of these work

00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,240
with gatsby

00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,680
so i've added one let me add a couple of

00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,600
more so

00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,960
i think adding a social media should be

00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:06,800
fairly quick so i'm gonna

00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:11,840
include a tweet here let me just grab

00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:11,840
that twitter link

00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,240
and then we'll probably add one more

00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,440
component here and then i can show you

00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,240
how the

00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:25,120
live preview works with gatsby so let's

00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:27,120
also add a map block

00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,560
so you can see there's a variety of

00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,280
different components that

00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,800
we have here uh integrated with our

00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,479
gasoline side okay so i've made some

00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,919
changes using drupal's layout builder

00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:38,720
i'm going to save this

00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:39,680
and as soon as i've done this you'll see

00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,400
a new queue

00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,199
uh a build is happening on gatsby again

00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,840
it's gonna take a

00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,400
few seconds to build that page so this

00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,039
is my

00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,479
gatsby live site that is being built uh

00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:52,240
also if i go back so you can see that

00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:54,639
build was completed in six seconds

00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,639
also if i go back to the site uh we also

00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:58,319
have the gatsby cloud live preview

00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:00,080
enabled here as well so you can see that

00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:01,600
also updated

00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,039
and how this works is i'm going to show

00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,000
you the difference between the gatsby

00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:06,960
live preview

00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,400
versus the gatsby side so i go back to

00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,000
my easy content back in

00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,520
and within the layout builder itself we

00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,120
have a preview button

00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,800
and if you click on the preview button

00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,479
it shows the mobile version first you

00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,240
can go full screen

00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:20,000
and we don't want to look at the drupal

00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,240
right now so since we have

00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,840
we're talking about gatsby today i'm

00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,479
gonna show you the catchphree cloud live

00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,479
preview

00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:27,919
so you can see uh this is the page that

00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:30,639
i just created

00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:31,680
uh and i'm able to see uh an inline in

00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:34,000
contextual

00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,600
preview of this page uh within the

00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,880
drupal interface so this is actually a

00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,720
gatsby page

00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,639
uh in which we place the hero component

00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,720
the texture center line there's the red

00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,400
background you have the social media

00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,919
and then you have the google map and

00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,520
just to confirm this is a gatsby page

00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:48,800
i'm going to copy the url and open it in

00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:51,199
a new tab as well

00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:53,360
just to show you so you can see this is

00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,000
on uh gatsby cloud this is the preview

00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,039
link

00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,160
and like i mentioned uh this is the live

00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:59,759
leave and then you have the

00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,960
actual incremental site and i'm going to

00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:03,599
show you the difference between these

00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:05,440
two so i'm going to copy the url

00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:07,120
so this is my actually gatsby front-end

00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,479
site this is what the visitors

00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,560
will see right this is where you

00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:13,120
configure your domain and you can see

00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,560
uh the url that we provided is the

00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,280
custom one that we controlled we are

00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:19,120
controlling from the drupal backend

00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,400
uh so to also show you how the live

00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,319
preview works uh

00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,160
you know if your editors make some

00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:25,440
changes to the content so

00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,599
the layout builder as i mentioned you

00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:30,000
can even add sections so let's add

00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:30,720
a two column section here so you can see

00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,160
i've added a

00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,919
two column section i'm gonna drag and

00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,160
drop some blocks here so i'm gonna drag

00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:39,039
the social media on the left

00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,000
i will drag the map block on the right

00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:41,680
right again

00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,599
uh all these features are provided by

00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:47,039
layout will drop out of the box

00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:48,560
i hit save and edit and now you will see

00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:50,479
uh the difference between the live

00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:53,039
preview so this is the live preview

00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:53,840
i don't have to refresh this page so i

00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:56,479
can open it

00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,199
in within easy content back in using the

00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:59,759
layout builder

00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:00,240
or i can open it in a new tab but you

00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:01,759
can

00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,680
you'll see that just take a couple of

00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:05,039
seconds and then automatically it's

00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,280
showing the live preview

00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:09,440
so i can do these changes in the draft

00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:12,319
mode before my node is published

00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:13,919
and once i'm satisfied i can push this

00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:15,759
and publish this content

00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:17,280
so the live preview automatically

00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:19,120
refreshes as you make these changes and

00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:21,599
you can see here

00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,319
we added a two column layout below the

00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:23,840
hero

00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:25,759
and now we have a one column layout

00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,120
followed by two columns and i was able

00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:31,120
to drag and drop and

00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:32,719
place our custom blocks and uh

00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,240
if i go to my front-end side which is

00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:35,360
what the resistor see since this is a

00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,599
published node

00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:39,519
this changes reflected automatically i

00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:41,360
can refresh this

00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,360
and you can see the change was also

00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,800
pushed to the uh production site on

00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:48,560
gatsby cloud

00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:51,200
so this is how you know

00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:53,200
it's possible it works really well uh

00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,760
you can try this out as well uh easy

00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,600
