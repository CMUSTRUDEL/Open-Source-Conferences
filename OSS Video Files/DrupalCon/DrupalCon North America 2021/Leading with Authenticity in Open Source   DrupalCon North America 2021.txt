00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:46,800
narcy

00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:53,440
hi everybody thank you so much

00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,719
all right so let's dive right in and

00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:57,840
thank you for attending

00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:00,079
this talk leading with authenticity in

00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,640
open source

00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:03,440
as audra mentioned my name is nurizi

00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,760
sanchez

00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:07,920
and i am the senior open source program

00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,000
manager at get lab

00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,600
and she's already mentioned a lot of

00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,080
this so i'll just say that

00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:15,600
my background is in product program and

00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,880
project management

00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:22,080
and in business operations and so i'm

00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:25,200
not a developer um but that's

00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:28,479
i use that background as a strength

00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,880
within the open source world

00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:32,079
and today i want to talk about how to

00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:35,840
become a leader

00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:37,360
in open source and

00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,520
in order to do that i want to

00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:41,040
acknowledge that there are many steps or

00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:44,000
there are several steps along

00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,680
people's journey sometimes people

00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
identify as a beginner

00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,920
or that they've been around for a while

00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,880
or they consider themselves false

00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,520
veterans

00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,159
and i kind of made up these year

00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,119
estimates

00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:59,200
but i personally consider myself to be

00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:01,360
around for a while

00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,560
because i've been an open source for

00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,399
nearly a decade

00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,399
but i still don't feel like a boss

00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:08,479
veteran

00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:10,319
and i wanted to mention that because

00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,959
oftentimes when we think about

00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:13,440
becoming a leader some of us feel like

00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:17,120
we

00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:19,599
can't be one because of various factors

00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,840
sometimes there's imposters syndrome or

00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:23,599
we experience

00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:25,760
microaggressions we may not know how to

00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:29,680
handle negative feedback well

00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:33,360
or when we try to engage in a community

00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,360
there's a lack of response

00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:37,440
another reason might be that there are

00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,599
just so many

00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,360
open source projects in the world that

00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:43,040
we might not feel like we have a good

00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:46,080
grasp of them

00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:47,120
all of them so we might feel like even

00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,599
though we're

00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,400
an open source leader what does that

00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:52,720
really mean

00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,720
you know if we don't actively contribute

00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:57,040
to every single open source project

00:02:54,720 --> 00:03:00,239
so it could uh factor into the imposter

00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,239
syndrome for example

00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,319
today i want to talk about how to become

00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,599
a leader

00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:12,800
and how we can bring our full selves

00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:12,800
to our projects and our communities

00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:20,640
we'll go over two things or two

00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:22,239
main areas first i'd like to share

00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,680
things that i think that everybody

00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:26,640
should know about

00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,159
leadership in general and then i'd like

00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:31,280
to share a little bit about my

00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:32,959
own journey in open source and

00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,959
what i bought bit what i've already

00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:35,840
tried where i think that i can still

00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:39,200
grow

00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,680
um and a little bit just more about my

00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,200
journey

00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,760
in order to um inspire others perhaps

00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:48,640
with

00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:48,640
with what i've uh overcome

00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,680
all right so let's start with things

00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:57,360
that i think that everybody should know

00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:59,920
about leading with authenticity

00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,400
and i want to start off by prefacing

00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,239
that

00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,760
a lot of what i'm going to talk about

00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:06,560
today is

00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,599
are things that i learned during a

00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,080
workshop

00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:11,680
a four-day workshop taught by denise

00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,000
rabius

00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:16,320
that is part of the stanford continuing

00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,479
studies curriculum

00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,079
the course is called women leaders

00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:23,040
mastering influence

00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:23,600
authenticity and power but i think that

00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,440
a lot

00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:29,680
of what i learned there can be

00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:31,360
that would benefit anybody so i'd like

00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:34,560
to share that with you all

00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:37,600
today the first

00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:39,120
is overcoming your fears because in

00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:43,280
order to be a leader

00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:45,520
we need to do just that

00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,639
and one of the things that we need to

00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:49,680
become aware of

00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:50,400
is our mental models because we're often

00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,759
limited

00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:57,360
by our mental bottles this

00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:59,759
uh for those of you that are not um

00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,120
that don't know what a mental model is

00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:04,240
these are things like

00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,039
perhaps thinking that uh women should be

00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,440
modest

00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:09,120
or that men are the ones that should

00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:12,240
become firefighters

00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:16,400
or any other sort of construct

00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:19,120
that we have of how the world should be

00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,600
there's a lot of power in understanding

00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,720
which

00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:24,240
mental models we already have because it

00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:27,440
then allows us to

00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,080
change them as necessary because after

00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,880
all

00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:33,600
it's all in the way that you look at the

00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,600
situation

00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,320
another thing that's really important is

00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:41,680
overcoming

00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,680
our negative self-talk

00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,280
in the course they talk about our or

00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:48,000
they mention

00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:49,280
um negative self-talk as being a

00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
saboteur

00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:53,600
so basically killing our chance of

00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,479
success

00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,960
and one of the strategies for overcoming

00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:00,080
this

00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:02,880
is naming your saboteurs so

00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,880
thinking about the types of voices or

00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:07,280
the types of

00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,880
that negative self-talk that you hear

00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:12,160
and giving in a name like

00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:15,759
anxious annie or demeaning daryl or

00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:18,240
comparative kathy or fearful frank

00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:20,560
and being able to give them a name gives

00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,520
you power over of them and lets you

00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,560
identify them

00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:26,400
more easily when you hear them

00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,560
this other book that i read a few years

00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:31,440
back was talking about how

00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,639
um you can also think of these saboteurs

00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:36,080
as almost like an

00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:36,800
abominable snowman and when you shine a

00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,440
light on it

00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,800
it melts the negative self-talk or the

00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,360
saboteurs

00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,080
so i've included this picture of shining

00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,120
that light

00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:49,840
because that's how we can overcome our

00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,840
negative self-talk

00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:55,680
when we uh are overcoming our fears we

00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:57,280
need to take risks

00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,840
because that's how you learn and that's

00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:02,319
how you grow

00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,360
during the course denise shared this

00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:05,759
onion model

00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,840
where you need to keep pushing yourself

00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:11,280
outside of your comfort zone

00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:12,639
and she suggested taking a 15 sleep each

00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,400
time

00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:15,680
that way you don't put yourself directly

00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:19,680
in the danger zone

00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:21,599
but you keep growing and as you succeed

00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,720
you keep building your confidence as

00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,800
well

00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,479
and what this might look like is let's

00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:29,680
say for example that you want

00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:31,520
to pitch an idea to your executive team

00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,720
but you're not quite sure how they will

00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:37,280
take it

00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:39,440
so decreasing that risk to 15

00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,400
might mean instead making the

00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,840
presentation

00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,240
and giving it to your manager first for

00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:46,879
input

00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,720
and then perhaps going a step above that

00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:51,039
and pitching it to a wider set of

00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,879
people and each time you keep pushing

00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:54,960
yourself a little bit more

00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:58,479
gaining confidence and then you're more

00:07:54,960 --> 00:08:00,160
likely to succeed

00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:04,479
all right the next thing i want to talk

00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:07,280
about is identifying your values

00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:08,240
as a leader it's important that you know

00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:11,280
what your values

00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,000
are and you can regularly speak to what

00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:15,360
they are

00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,120
to voice them i included an image of

00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,039
this lighthouse because

00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,360
during the course they mentioned that

00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:24,960
your value should be like a lighthouse

00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:27,360
really lighting your path forward

00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,400
and you're once you have identified your

00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,639
values

00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:32,000
it helps to guide your career and really

00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:34,000
everything that you do

00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,680
within open source projects and just

00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,839
anything else

00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:40,159
so something that they asked us to do is

00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:43,279
identify your top three

00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:46,160
and try to write down what

00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:50,240
those values mean to you and to provide

00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:50,240
an example for each kind of value

00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:55,519
then you should regularly practice

00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:59,360
speaking from your values

00:08:55,519 --> 00:09:01,360
and identifying other people's values

00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,720
so what they had us do in the course

00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,519
again was to

00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,160
practice speaking and speaking about

00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:08,399
what we

00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,680
do like basically just introducing

00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:12,399
ourselves

00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:13,600
and then the listener tried to identify

00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:16,000
values

00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,519
um that we had just giving that

00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,680
introduction

00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,640
and it was really interesting because

00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,600
sometimes there was

00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:24,399
a mismatch between what we identified as

00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,680
our values

00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:30,720
and what the listener was hearing and so

00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:33,120
regularly practicing that helps you

00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:35,200
choose words that align with your values

00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:38,080
and promote that

00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,720
and then it also helps you learn to

00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,959
identify

00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,959
other people's values and when there's

00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:44,640
an alignment between your values and

00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:47,519
somebody else's values

00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,720
that's when real connection happens and

00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:52,959
you're able to

00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,959
uh be your most authentic self

00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,320
aligning your values is incredibly

00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:00,000
important

00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,600
because society might tell you that

00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,800
something is

00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:06,880
great that you're incredibly successful

00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,160
but if your values are not aligning to

00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:10,480
that you won't

00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:13,120
feel like you're succeeding you might

00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,720
feel unfulfilled

00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:17,200
an example of that would be that you

00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,079
have a dream career what others refer to

00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,720
as a dream career

00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:22,480
but you might not be happy and in open

00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,160
source that might be that you're

00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,839
pouring in all your effort into a

00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:28,959
particular uh

00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:30,839
project and somehow you feel

00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:32,720
uh burned out or just you know

00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:34,720
unfulfilled and again

00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,640
when you're able to align your values

00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:39,839
that's when you're able to

00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,839
see the most success

00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:46,560
all right the next thing is learning to

00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:48,720
self-promote

00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,600
and there is this somewhat confusing

00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,360
sentence

00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,200
that they mentioned which i'll read out

00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:56,640
loud it's not

00:10:53,200 --> 00:11:00,160
what we know it's not who we know

00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:03,839
it's who we know that knows what

00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:06,880
we know give voice to your value

00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:08,160
and what this means is basically that no

00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:10,720
matter how smart you are

00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:12,240
no matter how accomplished and competent

00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,800
you are

00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,880
you're not going to truly succeed to

00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:19,600
become a leader to be well known

00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:20,480
unless other people recognize that you

00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,800
know that

00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:24,399
thing that you're the expert so that

00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:27,120
other people say ah

00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:28,240
naritzi she's the person that does x y

00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,800
and z

00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,560
so the more people that know that you're

00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,399
the expert in this so that you should be

00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:37,279
approached for that

00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:38,720
the more that you'll be able to succeed

00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:40,839
and the more opportunities that you'll

00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:43,200
get

00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:45,279
naturally and when

00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,120
we're self-promoting or when we think

00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:49,440
about self-promotion

00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:52,000
it's important that we check our

00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:54,959
perceptions

00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,959
for those of you who uh may not know

00:11:54,959 --> 00:12:00,000
google has put on this

00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:01,360
series called i am remarkable which

00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,160
talks about

00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:05,519
which which helps women especially learn

00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:08,880
how to self-promote

00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:09,519
and there's a study that they referred

00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:12,880
to

00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:13,440
that shows that women and men don't like

00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,519
women

00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,360
who promote themselves that it's

00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:20,800
socially frowned upon

00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:23,600
and a lot of this has to do with women

00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,160
are oftentimes seen as needing to be

00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,839
modest

00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,839
in most cultures so when they're

00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:28,560
self-promoting it's seen as something

00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:31,600
that

00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:33,920
shouldn't be happening and there's uh

00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,639
perhaps there's bias that happens from

00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:38,800
both women

00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:42,079
and men for that

00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:44,880
so when we're self-promoting

00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:47,279
we need to understand that we have the

00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:50,560
ability to craft our own story

00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:52,560
we're the ones in control and so

00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:54,160
it's important to learn how to speak

00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:57,279
about ourselves

00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,839
um and what we're saying and what we're

00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:00,800
doing

00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:02,000
all of that creates our story and

00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:05,760
opportunities

00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,200
happen as a result of that perception

00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:11,040
careers can happen

00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:12,959
as a result of your intention so

00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,399
be mindful of the words that you're

00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,120
saying and how you're presenting

00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:20,320
yourself

00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:22,880
as that defines your story

00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,760
it's also important for us to work on

00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:26,240
our presence

00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,839
as leaders and there was this really

00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:30,880
cool graphic that they showed

00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:34,320
about how uh how important

00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:35,600
the visual and vocal part is in what in

00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:38,639
your presence

00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:40,720
in fact 55 of perception is based on

00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:44,800
visual things like body language

00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:48,000
eye contact gestures 38 of perception

00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:50,000
is based on the vocal so the

00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,040
tone the volume and cadence of your

00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
speech

00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:55,920
and only about seven percent is actually

00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,800
the words and the content of what you're

00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,800
saying

00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:02,160
so remember that the next time that

00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:04,720
you're speaking

00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:07,519
another tip is to create strategic

00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,519
alliances

00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:15,120
one of the things that the course

00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:18,240
mentioned is that women in particular

00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,800
are very uh are often very good at

00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,440
forming

00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,000
deep relationships but they're not as

00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:25,440
good at

00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,639
casting out a wide net and uh networking

00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:30,079
outside of their

00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:32,800
their existing network so it's important

00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:34,000
for us all to remember to cast a wide

00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,399
net

00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,920
and to take on networking as part of

00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:40,399
your day job

00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,440
and that can be again within a company

00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:45,279
that you work

00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:48,160
at or within an open source project

00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:49,199
and we need to push ourselves to network

00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:53,120
outside of those

00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:55,120
areas so they suggest

00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,320
networking with somebody at least once

00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:59,600
per month

00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:03,040
that is outside of your organization

00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,040
or your open source project

00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:08,160
the other thing is too as we're forming

00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:10,079
these strategic alliances

00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:13,360
and just networking with people getting

00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:16,800
to know each other elevate others

00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:19,680
mindfully it's really important

00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:20,399
to give recognition and thanks gratitude

00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,240
to

00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:24,320
people at all levels not just the

00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:26,160
leaders to try to get noticed

00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:27,600
but everybody who's contributing to your

00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,360
project everybody that you're

00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,360
interacting with

00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:33,199
and they mentioned this concept of an

00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,959
emotional bank account which i thought

00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:36,800
was really interesting

00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:38,320
where they said that we should try to

00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:41,440
make sure that people have

00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:42,480
a positive deposit in their emotional

00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,800
bank account

00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:46,720
and this helps us then deliver negative

00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:49,199
feedback or critical feedback

00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,560
when necessary because people overall

00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:54,959
have this positive

00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:56,880
emotional bank account or deposit

00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:58,480
and the reason why i mentioned that we

00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:00,880
should do this mindfully

00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,920
is again that because women are often

00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:04,720
expected

00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:06,399
to put others in front of themselves

00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:08,399
they can sometimes forget to

00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:10,560
self-promote and to elevate themselves

00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:13,920
as well and it's just really important

00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:16,880
again to to elevate everybody equally

00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,880
don't forget yourself

00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:24,079
personal power for the

00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,720
purposes of this presentation personal

00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:27,199
power

00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:29,519
is your ability to get things done and

00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:31,440
to influence people

00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:33,279
and during course they mentioned that

00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:36,959
jeffrey pfeffer

00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:39,279
has created this model called the seven

00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:42,079
pillars of personal power

00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:43,839
which helps to explain how people

00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:46,160
actually build their own

00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:48,000
influence this has to do with

00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:50,800
influencing without authority

00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,800
which means that if you know i'm not

00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,680
your manager but i ask you to do

00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:56,000
something and you

00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:57,120
you do it i somehow have influenced you

00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,560
without having that

00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:02,800
direct authority so um i thought it was

00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:05,600
really awesome to see that empathy with

00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:06,880
others was one of the pillars of

00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,640
personal power

00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,240
and i think that sometimes we see

00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:14,880
leaders as

00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:17,839
being as not being the most empathetic

00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:19,120
and i think that it's really cool and

00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:21,600
validating to see that

00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:22,319
it is something that is one of the core

00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:25,439
pillars

00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:27,280
for building your personal power the

00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:30,080
other thing i want to call attention to

00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:31,679
is the ability to tolerate conflict and

00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:33,679
i'll mention that a little bit later but

00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:36,880
i think that this is something that

00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:40,000
um is exceptionally important as we

00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:40,000
build our personal power

00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:46,480
so how do we lose our power i

00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,960
did this exercise and i was thinking i

00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,840
lose

00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:51,919
power by having a negative attitude

00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:54,480
towards holding power

00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:56,559
wanting to be liked i'm oftentimes a

00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:59,679
people pleaser so that can

00:17:56,559 --> 00:18:00,000
make me lose power believing that hard

00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:02,400
work

00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,799
is enough for creating high visibility

00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:07,760
we need to self-promote

00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:08,320
giving credit to the team and not myself

00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,720
again

00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:12,480
needing to elevate everybody not

00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:15,039
forgetting myself

00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,760
and not wanting to fail this can hit

00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:18,480
people who

00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:19,600
are perfectionists or who really care

00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:22,799
about excellence

00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:24,559
very hard but we need to make sure that

00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:27,200
we understand that failure is a part of

00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:27,200
every journey

00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:31,600
all right improving your communication

00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:34,080
this is something that i

00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:35,840
i think is key and it's something that

00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:40,000
um i've given other talks about

00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:42,080
so uh feel free to check those out

00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,039
the first which i mentioned before is

00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:46,480
learning to handle

00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:49,919
conflict gracefully because top

00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:52,640
level professionals are able to

00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:54,080
engage in difficult conversations

00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:57,200
tolerate conflict

00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:59,120
and form strategic alliances again

00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:01,120
this has to do a lot with the way that

00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:05,679
you communicate and your ability

00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:05,679
to navigate difficult situations

00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:10,000
it's also important to pay attention to

00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:13,360
your speech

00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,160
and i mentioned earlier that there are

00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,880
different

00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:18,000
things that weigh into perception but

00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:20,640
something that

00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,600
i've seen a lot of women do and people

00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:24,799
in general

00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:25,280
is speaking very fast and when you do

00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:27,679
that

00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:30,320
there are a lot of hidden messages in

00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:32,480
that speech pattern

00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,679
when you speak too fast it might signal

00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:37,039
for example

00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:38,960
that what you're saying is not important

00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:41,600
and in that way you might be giving away

00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,600
your power

00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:45,120
something that i struggle with is

00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:48,640
sometimes being verbose so

00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:49,440
going on and on and so one of the things

00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,840
to do

00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:54,240
and which will help with making sure

00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:57,840
that your speech is more moderate

00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:58,400
is are moderated in speed is that you

00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:02,000
should learn

00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:02,320
how to speak concisely and know what to

00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:07,840
leave

00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:07,840
out this is a muscle that we can build

00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:11,760
all right and then this last thing is

00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:15,600
about

00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:15,600
feedback and introspection

00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:18,799
i'm not an expert in this model it's

00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:22,720
called the

00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:25,200
johari window but essentially what it

00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,919
is is saying that there are things that

00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,679
we know

00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:28,960
and there are things that other people

00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:32,960
know

00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:36,480
and we need to ask for feedback

00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:40,720
in order to understand our blind

00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:41,520
areas so in other studies they've shown

00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:44,080
that

00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:45,200
um asking for negative feedback for

00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:48,240
asking for feedback

00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:50,720
leads to higher job performance

00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,360
and specifically asking for negative

00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,360
feedback

00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,799
is the best thing that you can do

00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:58,080
because it can

00:20:54,799 --> 00:21:01,200
again help you identify what it is

00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:03,760
that you need to improve and

00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:05,280
uh sometimes receiving negative feedback

00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:09,200
is really difficult

00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:10,000
so um building that muscle and being

00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,919
able to

00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,440
deal with that is something that is

00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:16,720
incredibly important

00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:18,960
as a leader

00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,919
it's important for us to take time

00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:23,600
regularly

00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:27,200
to be introspective i try to do this

00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:29,600
like intentionally at least once a year

00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:31,360
usually much more often than that but

00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:34,480
not nearly as formal

00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:37,520
um i book a retreat place usually

00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:40,159
like an airbnb and go and

00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:42,159
think through my values like my

00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:43,039
priorities how things have shifted in

00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:45,440
the past year

00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:46,480
what i'm doing well what i'm not and

00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:51,280
this can help

00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:52,720
to help you unlock again that true

00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:54,640
authenticity because

00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:56,000
you're able to see whether or not the

00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,640
actions that you've done throughout the

00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,240
year

00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:00,240
have aligned with your values

00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,440
okay so we have just a few minutes left

00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,840
and i

00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,640
want to share some of my own journey and

00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:10,400
open source

00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:14,000
with you all i helped start

00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:14,720
endless in 2012 which is a company that

00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,960
makes

00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:20,480
linux computers for people with little

00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,480
to no internet access

00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:27,919
during that time we identified gnome

00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,320
as the technology that we would use in

00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:30,400
our

00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:32,320
system and that was really my

00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:34,720
introduction to open source

00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:35,440
before that i was really just a mac user

00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:38,640
windows

00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:39,200
but um i i didn't even know that open

00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:42,480
source

00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:44,799
software existed and so i

00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:46,720
started to get more plugged into the

00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:50,320
open source community i thought it was

00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:51,440
incredible how how many applications

00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:53,840
existed

00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,799
how they could really help our users

00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:57,520
because

00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:58,480
oftentimes we could modify them in order

00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,320
to

00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:02,880
make them better but also they were free

00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:05,120
of cost so people didn't have to

00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,400
you know spend all of their hard-earned

00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:09,280
money paying for

00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:10,559
a license for a software for just one

00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:14,320
application

00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:17,520
um so it it was something that that i

00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:19,120
fell in love with very quickly and one

00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:22,080
my manager at the time jonathan

00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:25,360
blandford invited me or encouraged me

00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:28,480
to speak at guadac 2015

00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:31,520
about um basically our learnings at

00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:34,000
endless so far during that

00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:36,720
time i ended up participating in an

00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:39,679
engagement birds of a feather session

00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:40,880
and as a result i became an engagement

00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:44,640
team member

00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:47,679
and i got really excited about

00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:49,760
improving the general

00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:51,440
community processes helping to make it

00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:53,840
easier for newcomers

00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:56,000
and just generally thinking through the

00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:59,039
strategy of how to expand

00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:02,799
and grow the gnome community

00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:04,799
because of my excitement for that i was

00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:06,880
encouraged to run for the board of

00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:08,080
directors within a year of my starting

00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:11,039
at the gnome foundation

00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:12,240
the gnome project and i was elected to

00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:15,600
become the president

00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:18,640
and chairperson of the gnome foundation

00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:21,279
um for three consecutive terms i

00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:22,080
loved it and i tried to think through

00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:26,799
again

00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:29,760
the longer term strategy of how to

00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:30,240
make gnomes successful during my time

00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,840
there

00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:33,919
we went from having just a single

00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:36,640
employee to seven employees

00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:39,039
because i think that for open source

00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:41,760
software foundations to really

00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:43,679
um succeed you need to have paid

00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:46,799
full-time

00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:48,960
people to be thinking about this

00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:49,840
and then because of my experience at

00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:52,960
gnome

00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:55,600
um i ended up looking for

00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:56,960
other open source related job

00:24:55,600 --> 00:25:00,080
opportunities

00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:02,880
and i became really excited about the

00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:03,679
opportunity at git lab where i would be

00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:06,880
able to run

00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:08,799
the open source program and

00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:11,120
it's an open core company itself and i

00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:12,000
was really intrigued by the business

00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:15,200
model

00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:17,600
and just the ability to enable ecosystem

00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,600
growth

00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:24,880
as i continued in my journey i

00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:26,480
you know and and even through the the

00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,360
course of the the workshop that i

00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:31,520
mentioned

00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:33,679
i've tried to identify my values

00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:35,760
and to really make sure that what i'm

00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:39,760
doing aligns with that

00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:43,039
three of my top values are collaboration

00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:44,559
inclusion and impact and these all kind

00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:46,480
of go together

00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:47,679
at the beginning audrey mentioned that

00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,760
you know i

00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:50,720
bring a people-focused lens to all that

00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,720
i do

00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:53,919
and i think this really speaks to it i

00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:57,279
care about

00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:59,600
everybody being able to contribute um

00:25:57,279 --> 00:26:01,039
my my parents are both from mexico i

00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:03,120
like always cared about

00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:04,080
uh doing something that it would include

00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:08,000
my family there

00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:09,520
so kind of a global perspective and um

00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,520
and it's it's just something that's very

00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:15,279
important to me

00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:18,000
and in my job i have been extremely

00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:19,279
happy to find that gitlab's values align

00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,279
with my own

00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:22,640
i've listed them out here they have this

00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:26,080
cool acronym credit

00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:28,240
that's collaboration results efficiency

00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:29,120
diversity inclusion and belonging

00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:31,360
iteration

00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:33,440
and transparency and i've just

00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:34,400
highlighted three that kind of directly

00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:36,880
map to my

00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:38,320
top three which is about collaboration

00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:42,240
results and

00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:42,240
diversity inclusion and belonging

00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,559
and the reason why i mention all of this

00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:49,440
is that

00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:49,840
during my time contributing to open

00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:52,640
source

00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:54,720
projects and specifically to gnome i had

00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:56,799
so much fun i was so in love with the

00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:59,919
community i still am

00:26:56,799 --> 00:27:01,919
and i experienced burnout because i was

00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:05,440
working on weekends i was working

00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:09,440
after my day job i was just non-stop

00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:11,360
contributing and after several years

00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,799
it's just something that i couldn't keep

00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:15,120
up

00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:16,799
and what that forced me to do was to

00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:19,279
really prioritize my

00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:20,159
efforts and to think more strategically

00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:22,799
about how

00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:23,360
i could create the impact that i really

00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:25,760
wanted

00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,760
to make

00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:32,000
i decided that creating impact for me

00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:33,440
would be partially focusing on

00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:37,039
collaboration

00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:40,559
with other open source projects and

00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:43,679
the most obvious one to me was working

00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:45,279
along with the kde community who had

00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:46,799
previously been seen as sort of a

00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:48,720
competitor to gnome

00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:50,480
but i thought that there could be a lot

00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:54,000
more that could be done together

00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:57,360
to advance the linux desktop

00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,159
ecosystem and so along with some other

00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:01,520
people

00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:04,799
i hope to start the linux app summit

00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:07,360
um which has now been happening annually

00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:10,240
and has been attracting people beyond

00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:12,640
just the gnome and kde communities

00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:13,279
and this is really meant to help again

00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:17,279
further

00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:19,440
the entire linux application ecosystem

00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:21,600
and i i wanted to mention this because

00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:23,120
again this is an example of how i've

00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:26,399
been trying to line

00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:27,919
what i'm doing with uh my values

00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:29,520
and again with that ruthless

00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:31,600
prioritization that

00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:34,640
you kind of have to have when you are

00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:34,640
trying to avoid burnout

00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:39,840
and along with that i have

00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:42,480
thought about how i can make the biggest

00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:46,240
impact with my time

00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:46,960
at get lab i am enabling ecosystem

00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:49,600
growth

00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:50,720
through the open source program um the

00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:53,440
program that i run

00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:55,520
gives our top tier for free and 50 000

00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:57,760
ci minutes to organizations

00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:59,360
so for organizations that couldn't pay

00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:02,880
for it otherwise i'm

00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:06,559
i feel that my program is really helping

00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:09,360
um i also am trying to

00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:10,840
help create metrics to help both the

00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:14,480
gnome foundation

00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:16,960
kde and any other open source

00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:17,840
foundation through the app ecosystem

00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:20,000
working group

00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:21,760
where we're defining different personas

00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:25,279
like event organizers

00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:26,240
or governing boards etc and really

00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:28,880
thinking through

00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:29,600
the metrics that need to be collected in

00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:32,480
order

00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:34,960
for us to be able to have more impact

00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:37,440
within our organizations

00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:38,720
and then the most recent project that

00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,960
i've taken up

00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:42,320
is contributing to the community

00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:45,440
advisory group

00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:47,760
at ieeesa open

00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:50,399
and this is around creating best

00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:53,200
practices for community handbooks

00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:54,080
because i have had an incredible

00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:57,440
experience

00:29:54,080 --> 00:30:00,000
onboarding at get lab git lab is an

00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:00,720
all remote company and again open core

00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,200
so it has

00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:04,720
many similarities to just regular open

00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:06,480
source projects

00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:08,080
and so having a community handbook i

00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,880
think is one of the key things that

00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,799
enables

00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:12,080
its success and i'd love to see that

00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:15,520
replicated at

00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:17,679
other in other communities i'm doing

00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:19,200
this work primarily with jessica singh

00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:20,960
and i want to just give a quick shout

00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:23,440
out to him

00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:24,080
and to all of the essay open people for

00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:27,440
joining

00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:30,559
us uh

00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:31,200
i just wanted to end with this fact that

00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:33,360
or this

00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,960
idea that we need to always be learning

00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:37,200
and to share back

00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:39,360
um have some people that i'd like to

00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:42,480
recognize there

00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:46,320
and this is uh

00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:49,279
an incredible quote for me um by jessica

00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:51,440
uh williams that says for me so far

00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:53,679
confidence has been a journey

00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:55,679
not a destination and i think that

00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:58,080
leadership is the same thing

00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:58,960
um you have to be confident in order to

00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:00,880
be a leader

00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:03,519
and just remember that it's always a

00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:05,760
journey not a destination

00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:08,480
i hope that i've contributed to your

00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:10,720
journey today

00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:12,720
thank you very much and i encourage you

00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:17,919
to connect with me on twitter and

00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:17,919
