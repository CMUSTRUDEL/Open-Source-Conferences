	00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,040
started we're a minute in so it's web

00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:08,000
form choose your own adventure

00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:10,559
start from my intro uh yeah chad you

00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,679
brought up the q a

00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:15,599
i'm willing okay let's try the q a and i

00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:16,880
can switch over to it my concern with

00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:19,119
the q a is

00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,480
i think there's an opportunity here i

00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:22,000
let's stick to the chat because look if

00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,920
someone asks a question in a queue and

00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,160
someone else can help me and knows the

00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:28,080
answer or can link to a resource

00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,840
that could help the discussion and i

00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,720
feel like the q a is going to be very

00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:32,320
isolated

00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,239
and i'll have to answer every question

00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:37,280
which won't be possible with

00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:39,040
wow 295 people in the room so let's

00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,719
stick to the chat

00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,239
and i'm good at this i can manage the

00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:44,480
chat and i look over here and you'll see

00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:46,160
me be distracted um

00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,000
all right i'm jacob brockowitz known as

00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,840
jayrocko it's on the web i'm a drupal

00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,360
developer and software architect i built

00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,190
and maintained the web4 module for

00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,840
drupal 8.

00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:57,120
[Music]

00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:59,840
so this is kind of like

00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,800
a an amalgamation of all my past

00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,719
presentations

00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,479
and i actually this slide includes links

00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:06,080
to all the past decks that i've done

00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:07,920
and what i did is i pulled information

00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,840
to one giant deck

00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,600
so we could choose our own adventure and

00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,760
go through lots of different topics that

00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:16,000
are developer specific or business owner

00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,680
specific

00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,040
and if you're working in government i

00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,640
definitely recommend checking out the

00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,000
web forms for government presentation

00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,880
the slides and by the way with each one

00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,520
of these decks

00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:27,680
if you google the name of the slide the

00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:31,280
name of the presentation you'll find a

00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,759
a video on youtube um i just love this

00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,520
slide

00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:35,200
jeff who is on here saw this

00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,720
presentation many years ago this is the

00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,960
first presentation i ever did

00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,960
about web forms when it was called yaml

00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,960
form i just think it's a funny slide

00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:45,600
because of the color scheme and

00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,960
uh the first presentation i ever did

00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,560
where i actually started getting

00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:52,079
comfortable doing this

00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:54,000
um so this is a massive deck

00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:55,600
with 24 different segments that we're

00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,240
going to go through

00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,680
um and yeah jessica i'll talk about the

00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,439
gov summit at the end because i think i

00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:04,479
can inspire people to attend that

00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:06,799
and remind me at the end um i'm going to

00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:08,080
go there's all these topics i put stars

00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:10,800
next to the topics that i feel

00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,640
i have to go through and we could jump

00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,400
around if someone asks a question and i

00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,480
have slides

00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:19,360
that you you know would help answer the

00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:22,000
deck um

00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,760
okay yep you're asking about designing

00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,640
and layout i can get to that that's

00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:28,160
cues always help that's okay so i'm

00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,360
going to start

00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,519
you guys are looking i'm not going to

00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,720
read through all of these my goal is to

00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:34,480
answer your questions

00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,920
spam is at the end and we can talk about

00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,280
that and to let you choose your own

00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,800
adventure in this presentation and get

00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,400
the most

00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,160
out of it there's a link to the slides

00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,879
in the chat and someone else can repost

00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:46,560
it

00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:49,440
um and the first thing we have to do is

00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:52,560
why use the webform module

00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:54,000
um i'm actually making notes between of

00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,040
some people

00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,159
comments all right d8 by the way hold on

00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,000
to your cues

00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:01,519
until i say you can because i think it's

00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,720
going to be hard for me i see how fast

00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:04,000
this is going okay

00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,360
the web web4 module powerful and

00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,480
flexible form builder and submission

00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,920
manager for drupal 8

00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:11,519
9. the use case i boiled it down to this

00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,040
simple three steps you're building a

00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:14,959
form you're collecting data and you're

00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:17,680
distributing that data

00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,000
and this is the only live demo i have

00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,239
set

00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,280
up okay let's go with sticking questions

00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:23,360
in the q a tab

00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,040
i see the problem and i agree with you

00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,680
and i'll jump over to it and i'll look

00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,440
at them

00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,360
let's move in that direction just put

00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:31,840
them in that tab

00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,440
um it's only a live demo where it's

00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,280
really just a walkthrough of the web

00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:37,200
form module to get people started i do

00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,440
this over and over again

00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,879
so the way i start out is i say hey

00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,640
here's a contact form everyone knows

00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:44,080
what a contact form in

00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,680
is and my goal is to walk through these

00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,519
steps and look we're at the form and we

00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,440
want to tweak this form

00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:51,360
i want to add a company so i go over to

00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,200
the builder

00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,360
and here's the form and i can add an

00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:58,480
element

00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,480
and here's a text field

00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:03,439
i'm going to call it company i'm not

00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:06,879
going to change any of the settings i'm

00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:06,879
just adding it to the bottom of the form

00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:11,760
i'm going to switch over to the view tab

00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,280
and you guys can see that there's a

00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,159
company element at the bottom there's a

00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,519
slight

00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:18,799
mistake here where it should be at the

00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:20,400
top below your name and be required

00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:21,840
um so what i'm going to do is switch

00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,440
over to the build tab

00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:26,000
and you can do the same thing you could

00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:28,560
drag it up check required hit save

00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,160
edit it it's a good opportunity a very

00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,840
advanced feature to the web 4 module

00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,520
which is editing the source

00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,960
and it's one of my favorite features and

00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,040
it

00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,400
this is yaml and it's showing you the

00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,639
render array behind the form

00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,400
we can talk more about this but what i'm

00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:44,479
doing is editing the forum and i'm

00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,000
changing your company

00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:49,600
getting the label and i'm making it

00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,280
required and i'm hitting save

00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,280
this is very powerful because you can

00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,400
add every single label on your form at

00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,840
once

00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,880
i'm going to jump to the test tab so

00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:59,440
instead of viewing it i'm going to go to

00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:01,199
the test tab which will fill out

00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,800
the form for you with reasonable

00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:05,120
defaults

00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,560
now i'm going to hit send and we have

00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,080
switched we've built a form

00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,560
we're collecting a submission we've

00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:12,479
collected a single submission here

00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,680
and now we're in that collect mode and

00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:16,320
we have that submission come in we're

00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:19,039
going to go over the results down

00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:20,880
and we can see the single submission we

00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:21,919
can click through on it

00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,000
we're going to go into this in a little

00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:27,199
more detail um you can view

00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,600
it i did take out you can download pdfs

00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:30,960
this feature exists it's just very cool

00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,759
where you can convert this submission to

00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,400
a pdf it's

00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:36,080
very useful for archiving the pdf that

00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,440
you're seeing can be customized in any

00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:40,320
way shape or form

00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:42,320
you can attach it to an email um i don't

00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:44,400
need to go much more into that feature

00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,840
so now we've reviewed these results and

00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,360
keep in mind the distribute

00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,440
nature of the webform module when i

00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,880
click submit it did send an email that's

00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,800
distributing

00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,720
the email you know basically it's a way

00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,479
of distribute you send an email

00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,479
another thing you might want to do is

00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:02,240
pull down all your submissions

00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:04,800
in a csv and that's in the download tab

00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,720
so i'm going to go here and i'm going to

00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,919
do it as an html table which could be

00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,520
open in excel

00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:10,880
you can customize this table that's

00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,919
going to open in excel but in this case

00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,319
i'm just going to scroll down to the

00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:14,000
bottom

00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:15,600
and just show it on screen it's really

00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,880
just showing you that yes you get this

00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,560
nice table

00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,160
and this is a plug-in that you could

00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,600
customize this table to your heart's

00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,960
content

00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,680
i mean we just walked through the

00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:27,600
end-to-end usage of the web4 module

00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,960
i'm going to go back up i can't believe

00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:32,720
there's this many questions

00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,720
so i'm going to go

00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:38,479
pause here look at some questions and

00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,479
see if i can answer them

00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:43,600
and maybe say yes okay i'm gonna run

00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,680
oh there's not that many questions and

00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,440
this helps are the pdf successful do

00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:50,400
they have the tags in place

00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:51,680
they're the html we're using a wk html

00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,840
generator there's lots of ones

00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,039
it's the entity print module so you

00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,639
don't know the accessibility but

00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:59,520
basically the concept is you take

00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:01,360
html and you put it into the pdf and i

00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:03,759
think generators do do some conversion

00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:07,360
of html's accessibility

00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:09,039
um are there payment donation options

00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,479
we'll get to add-ons

00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:12,479
there's a list of add-ons and we could

00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:14,560
talk about that i'll make a note

00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:16,160
toward the end about payments i think

00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,680
that's fine

00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,440
storing submissions alternative

00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:22,800
mechanisms yes um

00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:25,360
i will definitely spend time on that iso

00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:27,199
standards in web forms i'm gonna have to

00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,479
hold off on that until the end

00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:31,120
because i don't know exactly what you

00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:33,039
mean which is fine oh the spam

00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,599
i'm we have dedicated i'm making a note

00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:38,400
about spam

00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:39,039
okay so i'm seeing chris's question is

00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,039
there

00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:43,039
a limit by the way i have to read this

00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:46,319
out loud limit of the number

00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:47,919
of web forms an install can have

00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,440
there is a limit we have to work around

00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:51,440
for performance is web forms or

00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:54,080
configurancy's a little technical

00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:55,919
and if you have a thousand web forms you

00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,440
start hitting a slight bottleneck and we

00:07:55,919 --> 00:08:00,319
need to kind of sort that out and have

00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:03,759
that sponsored and work out that detail

00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:05,199
um i'm going to keep going and i

00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:07,039
i'm reading some questions and i will

00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:09,199
answer them as i go through

00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:10,319
so i'm going to skip one why did i build

00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:12,240
a webform module because i don't think

00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,560
that's as important as going to what are

00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,160
some

00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,280
features included in the webfort module

00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,199
because i think people are asking that

00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:19,680
type of question

00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:20,240
so we've seen this is a good list and

00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,520
and

00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,039
i think it answers some questions

00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,400
because people are curious like there's

00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:26,080
a drag and drop form builder you can

00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,680
have multi-column layouts so you can

00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:30,000
have

00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:32,000
elements or inputs side by side you can

00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,680
also have forms open in modal dialogs

00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,440
and even the confirmation message open

00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:38,560
in modal dialogues

00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:40,519
conditional logic is supported opening

00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:42,240
and closing scheduling submissions

00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:43,919
pre-population

00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,920
email handling is what we've talked

00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:48,160
about remote post is this idea of taking

00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,920
data and putting to a third party

00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,680
options are really heavily support that

00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:53,200
means like select menus or even building

00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,720
your own image select elements

00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,080
you'll see a demo of that on the

00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,680
right-hand side it's kind of more about

00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,720
submission i think people do ask this

00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,640
question i saw the limit

00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,839
of web forms you can limit the number of

00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,760
submissions

00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:06,240
and you could people can preview you can

00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:08,560
autofill draft

00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,399
you can have purging access controls we

00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,760
can spend some time on

00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,880
i'm really proud of the confirmation

00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,560
message handling because there's all

00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,640
these different aspects you can even

00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:18,160
share your forms with third parties

00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:21,200
there's someone asking a question about

00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:22,959
the differences from d7

00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:25,600
the quick explanation is a completely

00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:27,680
new code base in drupal 8 9

00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,360
and there is a web form migrate module

00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,880
that does move your forms and

00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:34,000
submissions over

00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,480
there is feature parity with web forms

00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,839
from

00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:39,440
drupal 7 how web forms are used on your

00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:41,680
site is different

00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,880
um and we can get into that that's

00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,399
probably the biggest like

00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,839
building a form is kind of the same

00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:46,640
experience and the same features but

00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:48,399
then when you start

00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:50,560
using them on your site it's a slightly

00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:53,839
different user experience

00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:55,519
and i'll come back to it with elements

00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:57,360
there's just a massive amount of

00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:59,040
elements it's like 80 plus elements from

00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,440
the standard ones you'd expect to

00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,480
advance

00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,920
html file uploads there's even a

00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,760
signature element i'm going to do a

00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:07,279
little demo of those in a second

00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,720
but then when you get into your elements

00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:09,440
and i kind of glossed over when i did

00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,839
the demo

00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:14,399
is there's just a ton of features and

00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:16,160
settings for each individual element

00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:17,760
now you can enhance select menus you

00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,399
also have dedicated computed elements

00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,640
but each

00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:22,560
you have tool tips slide outs input

00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,720
masks character counters

00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:27,760
there's all these different ways to

00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:29,519
tweak the behavior of your form

00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:31,440
but it's really this is a very important

00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:32,720
slide for anyone who feels overwhelmed

00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,560
when they look at the webform module it

00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:37,680
ships with reasonable defaults you don't

00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:39,600
have to customize everything but you can

00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:41,040
you saw on the demo i created an element

00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:44,880
and just hit saved

00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:47,200
there's nothing to worry about there um

00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:48,240
there are a lot of configuration

00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,160
settings and this

00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:52,240
is just walking through that simple one

00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,839
of the confirmation message and showing

00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,920
that there's

00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:57,600
seven different ways to display it as a

00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,200
page a message

00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,279
a modal dialogue and that's what i'm

00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:04,560
just going to show you here is

00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:08,079
you can click and

00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:08,079
hit save go to the test tab

00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:13,120
and you'll get a little modal dialogue

00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:15,760
and then someone can dismiss it

00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:17,920
okay i'm going to keep going kind of

00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,680
looking at the the chats going on

00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,680
so there's this style guide so there's

00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,360
an examples module the webform example

00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,519
module just

00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,720
ships with some examples of all the

00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:28,000
elements that are available this is like

00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,920
the kitchen sink

00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,279
this is even useful for your designers

00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,480
to see what the forms are going to look

00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:34,880
like when they

00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,560
in a dedicated theme and it's just

00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,120
showing you got little image select cute

00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,519
kittens

00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,200
signatures likerts there's a terms of

00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:42,079
service element just to kind of improve

00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,560
the ux

00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:46,160
all entity references are supported and

00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,600
this is showing composites i'm not

00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,519
actually going to spend a lot of time on

00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,639
composites but it's a group of elements

00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:52,079
working together and then at the bottom

00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:54,839
you get in the styles here's all the

00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:58,240
messages that are available

00:11:54,839 --> 00:12:00,079
um okay so we're on

00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,480
some features we're gonna take some of

00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:05,760
the questions and we're gonna go

00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:09,519
okay oh this is wow the q a is great

00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:12,240
because it's archiving them so

00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:14,000
conte oh wow someone's asking what is

00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,040
there a scenario where a contact form

00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,320
would be better

00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:21,519
than a web former or vice versa i

00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,800
actually have what are some alternatives

00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:24,160
i am going to jump around because this

00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,480
is choose your own adventure

00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,440
i'm going to answer that question here

00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,279
so

00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,800
this is one of the a slide from one of

00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,680
my first presentations where i felt like

00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,360
i needed to say

00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:35,200
web forms is not the end-all be-all

00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:37,279
solution there are proprietary

00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:39,360
form builders and you can embed those on

00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:40,639
your site there's open source ones

00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:43,040
i'm going to give a shout out for the

00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:46,320
middle one of formio which is a great

00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:49,680
solution where it's open source

00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:50,880
it's rich json powered forms and you can

00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,959
embed them on your site and they

00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:55,839
actually have some drupal support

00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:58,079
for core there is a contact module for

00:12:55,839 --> 00:13:00,399
building simple contact forms

00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:01,120
that integrate better in core but you

00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:04,079
don't get

00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,560
you can't build massive forms with that

00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:07,519
system

00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:09,120
and you can't have a lot of them so i

00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:10,880
always recommend starting out with the

00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,079
contact form module that starts and core

00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,760
to see if it meets your project's

00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:16,079
requirements and then switch to web

00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,079
forms

00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,360
going to some other questions by the way

00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,720
this is the whole point of choose your

00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,399
own adventure because i can just jump

00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:26,560
around

00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:28,560
um oh so people are really

00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,760
bothering me about spam this is

00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:32,079
hilarious

00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:33,600
i'm this is where i'm gonna just play

00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:35,120
with this deck and that's why i did this

00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,120
because i can jump to spam

00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,320
and just end this discussion all right

00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,480
spam

00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:44,480
these are three key spam modules i

00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:46,480
recommend honeypot antibot and captcha

00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:48,079
honeypot adds a hidden field antibot

00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,760
puts a little javascript and capture we

00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:50,720
all know is annoying as hell but it

00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:53,279
works

00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,000
um yep that's what i'm saying here um

00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:57,360
honeypot

00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,880
can be really good enough here's the

00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,839
thing that people are missing about spam

00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,480
protection is it can disable page

00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:05,360
caching capture is

00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:06,560
really guilty of doing this it will shut

00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,560
it down

00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,760
and that could be a huge performance hit

00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,920
there is a recipe

00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:13,600
that doesn't do that it's honeypot and

00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,880
antibot and the idea is to have the

00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,360
hidden field

00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:19,360
and the javascript and that usually

00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:22,800
stops robots

00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:24,880
but doesn't kill the page cache um

00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,920
it depends on how you want to handle it

00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,360
you could think about

00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:29,360
you know experimenting with other

00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:34,639
mechanisms

00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:34,639
um other questions okay

00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:41,120
oh okay um

00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:43,600
is there an element to match

00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:45,920
instructions all across the site

00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,440
shared with a jss library oh this is

00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:50,560
someone's got me on like

00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:52,880
how do you get a form to kind of work

00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:54,320
use a shared component library i don't

00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:57,519
have a good answer for that

00:14:54,320 --> 00:15:00,720
um i am going to talk about composites

00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:03,920
that's a question that someone's asking

00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:07,360
um okay computed elements let's get

00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:08,320
in that direction so

00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,920
i'm going to jump back so i'm going to

00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:13,519
ask about computed elements there are

00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:15,760
some good examples

00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:17,360
and you can learn from the example so

00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,639
the web form examples module shows

00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,480
examples of all the elements which we

00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:21,440
looked at examples of computed elements

00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,040
and how to

00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,560
use them and then there's also just you

00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,320
know a multi-sub form

00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:28,959
we know it's there but let's see one

00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:30,480
working and even multi-column layout

00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:31,920
some conditional logic and then there's

00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,199
the web form templates which just gives

00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:36,240
you really working

00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:37,600
real world examples and

00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:40,079
you know finding and choosing element i

00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,600
showed you that style guide but there's

00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:43,040
also a preview when you're adding it

00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,040
and this is a good way to just see all

00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:47,120
the different possibilities

00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,880
um when you're building your forms and

00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,560
this is an example of a computed element

00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,839
of just adding two numbers again i think

00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:55,279
this answers that question

00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:57,120
so using twig on the back end it hits

00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:58,399
the server with ajax and adds two

00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,880
numbers together and this is

00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:01,600
kind of sure this is showing you here's

00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,199
the numbers

00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,560
you go to the computer twig element and

00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:05,519
you see the little twig snippet that

00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,839
adds two numbers

00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:09,680
together there's also support for

00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:10,639
computed tokens which is the idea that

00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,160
you might want to

00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:14,079
have someone select an entity reference

00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:15,839
like a user and then pull some extra

00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:16,720
user data into your web form and

00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:19,839
submission

00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:21,199
and it uses tokens for that i am going

00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:24,320
to give a caveat on this

00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:27,440
this can be very performance intensive

00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:29,519
computations and i definitely recommend

00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,639
not doing too many of these and tracking

00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:32,959
them and not

00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:34,720
cascading computed elements that can

00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:36,000
cause problems the alternatives to write

00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,639
a little javascript and custom

00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,720
code and this is just an example of a

00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:41,839
multi-step form breaking it down into

00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,160
individual steps

00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:45,920
this this example does use ajax and

00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:49,040
shows that that's supported

00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:51,279
it also what it will do is this

00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,639
demo i'm showing it when it hits preview

00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:53,920
shows you that you have these settings

00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:55,519
you can say well i'd like to let people

00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,720
edit the information and they can jump

00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:58,320
back and forth

00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:00,160
all of these are configuration settings

00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:02,160
wizards have a lot of configuration

00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:05,919
options

00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:08,400
okay we're on examples

00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:09,839
let's see encryption i'm going to go

00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,799
back to

00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:12,799
that's security

00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,559
oh okay someone asked this question i

00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:20,000
like this question have you come across

00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:22,319
a scenario using

00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,319
context module with web form hiding and

00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:25,919
pre-filling form fields based on context

00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:28,799
like the current page

00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:30,160
heck yes happens all the time there are

00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:32,960
so many features around

00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:34,400
tweaking a web form based on a gazillion

00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,360
things like

00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,679
you know the fact that you could

00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:38,320
pre-populate a form well one we're

00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:40,080
tracking

00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,919
the source entity of a form where it's

00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:44,000
being submitted from and you can change

00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:46,400
a form based on that so someone's on

00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,600
a certain node and they're filling out a

00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,039
form

00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:52,000
you can fill out different information

00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:54,160
you can set different information

00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,000
um i actually think there's an

00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,679
opportunity

00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,320
to go there let's see what other

00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:03,679
questions styling

00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:04,480
that's a great question wow so many

00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:07,840
questions

00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:10,400
because there's 400 people

00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,400
okay

00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:16,080
we could go down every question here

00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:18,080
okay

00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:19,440
i am going to skip the technical deep

00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:21,440
dive and i think that's

00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:23,360
a good way to go where we're not going

00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:25,760
to go into

00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:27,520
how form api works in a form you can

00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,160
look at those slides you can ask me some

00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:31,200
questions

00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:34,320
at the end but i think this question

00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:37,440
about context comes down to how to

00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:39,919
publish a web form on a site

00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:42,160
so you can publish a web form as a node

00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:43,600
block or even in custom code

00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:45,120
and when we're talking about node

00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,720
there's a web form node module and

00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,720
basically you build your web form think

00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,080
of it like a view

00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,600
and you place it on your site so you

00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:53,039
build your web form and then you place

00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,720
it on a node

00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:56,320
and when using the web form node module

00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:58,799
it will capture

00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:59,840
results specific to that node the best

00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:01,600
way to describe

00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:04,080
web form nodes is if you were building

00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:06,480
an event registration system

00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:08,160
an event would be a node and let's say

00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:10,320
you wanted people to register you create

00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,919
one single registration form that you

00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:13,679
would attach to all those events

00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:15,840
and it actually tracks that information

00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:17,440
for each event

00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:20,080
that's called the source entity and we

00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:22,240
could go into that a little bit more

00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:23,520
blocks we all know just place a block on

00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:26,080
your site

00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:28,000
every pl wherever you place the block it

00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:29,280
will track also the source entity url

00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,799
where it's being submitted from there's

00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,400
lots of use cases for that

00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:34,240
i just want to emphasize in custom code

00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,240
you can actually just say i want to put

00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:38,160
a form here and it will just render it

00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:40,080
it's like pound type equals web form and

00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:42,480
that's an element

00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:44,960
um blocks just make it easier to include

00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:48,400
web forms anywhere panels layouts

00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:50,480
um any page on your site and yeah to

00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,919
place a block is as simple as go in and

00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,919
say i'd like to place a block and

00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:55,280
there's a web form

00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:57,520
starter block and i think i'm even going

00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:59,679
to let it be like here

00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:01,039
boom you select your form you can select

00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:02,880
your default values

00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:04,720
by the way the default values allow you

00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,880
to add more contacts because you can say

00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:08,640
what's the settings you know like what

00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:11,600
do you want to default to

00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:13,440
um nodes we went into this a little bit

00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:15,120
there's also a references tab so when

00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,559
you build that event registration system

00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:18,880
you have your registration form

00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:20,000
you can get this references tab that

00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:23,760
shows you every

00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,919
single event this form is used on

00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,960
so it's pretty easy to manage these

00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:29,039
massive

00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:31,919
ins like very many instances of a single

00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:31,919
form on your site

00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,440
this is i'm going to skip ahead from

00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:38,960
this because this really walks through

00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:41,039
that system of basically creating

00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,559
a dedicated instance of a contact form

00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:43,280
where i mean you see it's clicking the

00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:45,280
reference tab

00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:47,039
and adding a web form and you're

00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:49,120
basically saying my dedicated instance

00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:50,320
of this contact form

00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:52,720
it just shows you kind of the user

00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:54,159
experience behind it

00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,640
okay let's go back through some

00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:56,640
questions

00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:02,559
okay secure information we need to get

00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:05,440
to

00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:06,880
i love this question can web form

00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:09,440
submissions be converted

00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:11,200
into content like node content which is

00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:12,240
made public on the site what about views

00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,480
integration

00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:16,480
you've just asked like the big questions

00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:19,919
that i are worth answering

00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:23,120
um what i can do

00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:26,080
to answer that is start in how to extend

00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:26,080
the web form module

00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:31,440
so both the answers to your questions on

00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:33,440
you know

00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:35,200
can you generate content and views comes

00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:37,200
down to add-ons so add-ons are drupal

00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,640
modules and projects that extend and

00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,600
provide additional functionality to the

00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:42,320
webform module

00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:44,080
and drupal's form api and when you

00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:46,080
install the module you get a tab which

00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:49,600
lists out all these add-ons

00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:52,159
and there's almost 200 of them and

00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:53,120
i would like to do so this is showing

00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:54,799
you spam

00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:56,080
and i'm going to jump and go to that tab

00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:57,919
because i think i can answer your

00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:00,159
question by saying you go to the add-ons

00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:03,360
tab and you kind of look around

00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:04,320
so for views if i search reviews there's

00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,320
a web form

00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:07,360
views module that provides views

00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:09,120
integration

00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,799
there's also the web form views token

00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,120
field which i also like it's just a

00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:13,120
quick

00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:14,559
simple way to get submission data into a

00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,159
view

00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:17,679
that's one way so you can generate a

00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:19,440
view for your web forms also there's a

00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:20,640
dedicated video to show how to put those

00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:23,360
views

00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,159
onto your site but what i really like to

00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:26,000
promote

00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:27,280
is this content i don't even know the

00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,799
maintainer of this it's called the

00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:31,120
content

00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:33,440
web form content creator module what

00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:37,360
this is is a handler that generates

00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:40,400
nodes on your site this is awesome

00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:42,080
this one it creates a node hence totally

00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,760
available to views and also sometimes we

00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:46,000
just want nodes we want web forms to

00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:48,480
kind of front-end that user experience

00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,280
to create a node and this is a really

00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,520
popular

00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:52,480
powerful module and frankly it's well

00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,559
maintained

00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,760
i mean this i strongly recommend

00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:57,760
checking it out

00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,799
along the way you also might find code

00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,320
snippets so

00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:01,840
you know someone brought up like user

00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:03,360
you could also create users

00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:05,440
there's code snippets to do that you

00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:07,280
create a web form handler and i get into

00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:10,799
that in a little bit

00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:10,799
um i'm going to go back here

00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:16,240
okay i'm going to finish on add-ons to

00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:18,559
say listen this is the breakdown

00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,919
spam protection integrations someone

00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:21,120
brought up payment

00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:22,880
this is the way to answer payment

00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,440
there's an integration with most payment

00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,960
systems

00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:26,559
it and i think this question was about

00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:30,880
authorized.net

00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:34,400
um if there's not an authorized

00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:35,039
net add-on you could use the commer

00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,039
there is a

00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:38,320
commerce integration module web form

00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:40,240
commerce integration so you could use

00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:41,520
the commerce ecosystem to get that

00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:44,240
support

00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:45,279
or you could look at other payment

00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:48,799
modules i'm

00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:50,480
pretty sure there's a paypal one

00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:52,159
and you can copy the code and basically

00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:53,840
it's kind of like syncing up the apis

00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:55,840
it's where someone submits a form you

00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:58,799
have this handler it's a plugin

00:23:55,840 --> 00:24:00,159
a snippet of code and you make the

00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:02,159
payment and then bring the person back

00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:06,760
to the form

00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:09,520
um okay i'm going to keep going down

00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:10,880
accessibility oh boy i'm making a note

00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:13,520
there when i'm going to come back to

00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,520
that question

00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:19,039
oh someone asked a really good feature

00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:21,360
question ken asks is there a way to make

00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:23,120
radios and check boxes customized for an

00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:25,679
answer to a previous question

00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:27,120
the answer is no i had never thought of

00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:30,400
that and someone brought that

00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:32,400
up and it kind of blew my mind i saw in

00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,760
another system and i'm not really sure

00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:37,600
how i would implement it

00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:39,360
uh frankly it does bring up ready

00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,880
this is not the best answer to a

00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:42,240
question like that but it lets me jump

00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:46,320
to a segment

00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:49,440
about adding custom css in javascript

00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:52,000
to a forum so

00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:53,520
if i go over to here and i want to make

00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,360
sure i'm in the right segment yes i am

00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:56,720
okay this is going to address a couple

00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:59,039
of questions about design

00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:00,400
and tweaking the web forms look and feel

00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:01,440
so how do you change the look and feel

00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:04,640
of a web form

00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:05,200
well everything that's displayed on

00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:07,120
screen

00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:08,640
you can i go out of my way this is like

00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:10,400
a core thing if you're rendering

00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,799
something you can add custom classes you

00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,760
can add

00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:14,880
even custom styles and you can add

00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,880
custom attributes

00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:18,320
and classes i think people are familiar

00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,880
with styles would be adding a little

00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,480
padding

00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:22,720
attributes i use for tracking codes

00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:24,159
usually and yeah

00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:26,559
this screenshot is showing you an

00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:28,159
element where you can go in and change

00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:29,440
the wrapper think of it as the whole

00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:33,760
container

00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:34,480
around an element and you can go and add

00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:37,440
classes

00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:39,200
and styles to the actual element and

00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,960
then you can add attributes there's even

00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:43,120
the ability to change the label

00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:44,720
associated with the text field so that

00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:47,200
your name you could change the look and

00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:49,360
feel of that

00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:50,640
this is starting to answer the the we

00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:52,640
don't have the ability to do

00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:54,640
you know conditional logic on radios and

00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:57,520
check boxes on the options

00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:59,120
but there's some ways to do it frankly

00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:00,960
but anyway we'll start here

00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:02,320
you can add custom css and javascript i

00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,600
think people understand just a little

00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:05,440
snippet of css

00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:07,200
with javascript you can add custom

00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,960
client-side conditional logic so you

00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,880
could do that based on a question using

00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:13,679
a little jquery

00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:14,640
um this is a good example it's just

00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:17,919
showing you the ui

00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:19,520
it's a tab i'm adding basically a border

00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:22,400
around each element

00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:25,360
and an alert to the form and you can do

00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:28,240
a lot more from there

00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:29,120
um moving down kaleem asked about zapier

00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:33,200
integration

00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:34,480
um this is totally supported uh there's

00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:37,440
a dedicated video

00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:39,279
and i'm going to show you this because

00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:42,640
sorry about that i lost you for a second

00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:45,039
i'm gonna go back over i see what my

00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:46,720
problem is

00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:48,799
i'm gonna go over here and show you

00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:51,600
there's a videos a help section

00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:55,679
which is videos and someone i don't know

00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:58,400
if zapier is going to come up let me see

00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:58,799
us using web forms to send a submission

00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:01,120
is

00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:02,799
safe here done by webwash that helps

00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:04,559
explain it's pretty easy because there's

00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:06,559
a remote post handler

00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:08,400
that allows you to push data to a third

00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:09,919
party and i can demo that i'm going to

00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:12,720
walk through some of the other questions

00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:16,400
and see if i want to go there

00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:17,440
um i like this okay so pdfs we'll talk a

00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:19,440
little more about it

00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:20,960
pdf generation is available via dross in

00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,240
the sense of you can export your

00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:24,720
submissions

00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:26,559
via drush and you can convert your

00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:29,600
submissions to pdf you'll get a zip

00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:34,480
it'll write a zip out to a file

00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:38,080
um okay i'm going to keep going

00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:41,279
oh good we're i can now

00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:43,760
look at my little list here and

00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:47,120
we're at two so we have till three

00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:47,120
o'clock we have 20 minutes left

00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:52,159
i can answer some more questions and do

00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:57,600
some better demos

00:27:52,159 --> 00:28:02,480
um i'm going to go

00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:04,720
to securing a web form

00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:06,159
well actually i'm going to jump back to

00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:07,279
to sharing a submission because i like

00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:09,840
just showing this feature

00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:10,480
it makes me happy um you can share your

00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:12,320
web forms

00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,760
so there's a web form share module and

00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:15,200
all it does is add a tab

00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:17,039
you have to enable this and say i'd like

00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:19,760
to let a third party look at my

00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:21,520
web form but basically in that tab you

00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:23,120
can get a little javascript snippet that

00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:25,279
you can embed on any third-party

00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:27,600
website and they will embed the form

00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:29,200
this is a little iframe that gray box is

00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:32,399
your form in an iframe that

00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:34,320
could be outside of drupal now

00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:36,320
i'm going to keep going to talk about

00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:38,880
securing a web form submission i i think

00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:40,720
this is really really important

00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,919
you can encrypt the data being written

00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:44,399
into drupal

00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:45,360
that is one way to secure your data the

00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:48,080
other way

00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:50,960
is to not store the data in drupal

00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:54,799
disable the saving of results

00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:56,320
and you can send it the email or use a

00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:59,279
web form handler to push it somewhere

00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:00,640
else remote posted to a crm for example

00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:02,399
just a screenshot of the web form

00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:04,799
encrypt module which is listed in the

00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:06,240
add-on section

00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:07,600
i'm just showing this feature just

00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:09,200
important everyone knows that this

00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:10,960
exists there's a little check box you

00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:14,159
disable it

00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:15,600
and data's not going it's drupal ever

00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:16,799
that's it if you upload files they're

00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,000
going to get written to the server but

00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:20,799
then they get deleted because they're

00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:23,600
marked as temporary

00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:25,760
now i'm going to go to this distributing

00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:27,200
one to continue this discussion

00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:29,039
and really talk about handlers because

00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:31,360
i've mentioned this term and this is an

00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:34,480
essential concept

00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:35,919
a handler handles data coming in to a

00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:37,600
web form a submission

00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:40,080
and the use case is our email which we

00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:41,440
talked about pushing data to a crm

00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,799
remote posting but there's also

00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,840
subscribe to a mailing list so there's a

00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:46,159
mailchimp module

00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:47,760
a handler so that module provides a

00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:49,200
handler that subscribes someone to a

00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:51,360
mailchimp list

00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:53,039
and you can also do stuff like flag a

00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:54,640
submission based on submission values

00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:56,399
like conditional logic

00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:57,679
you can even change the confirmation

00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:59,440
message and

00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:01,360
this is showing you the four kind of

00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:02,880
types of handlers that are coming

00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:04,880
shipped with the webform module email

00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:06,159
we've we've talked about remote posts

00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:08,000
were in a demo

00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:09,600
but actions and settings are worth just

00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,799
discussing here and saying

00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:14,320
an action would be someone enters a

00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:16,640
certain value and you want to flag a

00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:17,679
submission so actions act on a web form

00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,520
submission

00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:20,880
and most actions and settings usually

00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:22,080
work best with conditional logic

00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:24,960
honestly so

00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:26,480
someone enters uh if it's healthcare i i

00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:28,080
don't feel well you could put an action

00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:31,200
that flags a submission

00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:33,279
now settings act on a web form

00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:36,000
so you could change a web forms behavior

00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:36,720
so the example of settings would be go

00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,919
back to the

00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:40,240
situation where someone says i don't

00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:41,679
feel well well you probably want to

00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,960
change the confirmation message i'm just

00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:44,159
thinking like someone's filling out an

00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:47,200
appointment request form

00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:49,360
or whatever notification and

00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:52,320
you can use a settings handler to change

00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:54,080
it the confirmation message or the url

00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:55,360
to be more specific to the user because

00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,080
you know a little bit about them so you

00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:58,799
conditionally

00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:59,440
change the message to say we will reach

00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:02,799
out to you

00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:04,080
in just a few hours and the last one is

00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:05,519
the debug it

00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,960
shows you the information coming through

00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:08,080
i recommend just using it when you're

00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:09,039
getting familiar with handlers

00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:11,039
especially if you're doing your own

00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:12,559
custom

00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:14,320
and this one's going to walk through a

00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:15,840
nice feature with emails i think it's

00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:18,960
just a powerful one

00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:20,000
where it besides

00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:22,240
picking where you're going to send an

00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:25,360
email you can actually route the email

00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:27,840
to different email addresses based on

00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:29,120
a selection in a drop down menu or radio

00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:30,799
buttons this is just showing you the

00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:33,600
tweak template where you can actually

00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:34,880
set tweak templates to build an email

00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,200
but look it's just gonna pull down the

00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:37,760
two

00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:39,120
and select the type of feedback

00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:41,039
someone's selecting well

00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:42,960
is it a comment send it to comments at

00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:44,399
example.com if it's a bug

00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:47,120
send it to bugs an example this is a

00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:48,799
very nice simple ui for that

00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:50,320
this is a really important one for

00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:52,399
anyone doing enterprise stuff

00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:53,360
this is showing you how to add a remote

00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:56,159
post handler

00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:57,519
so what i'm going to do is in here say i

00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:59,240
would like when someone fills out this

00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:02,559
form to post it to

00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:04,880
mycrm.com and you can pick the data by

00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:06,320
default it's just the data a user enters

00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:09,039
and no metadata

00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:10,240
the most important thing in this is that

00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:12,000
check box at the bottom

00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:13,519
enable debugging because it shows you

00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,159
what's going to happen

00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:17,840
so when i go to the test tab and hit

00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:19,679
submit this is going to fail

00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:21,200
because my crm doesn't exist and it's

00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:23,200
not really happy that i keep posting

00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:26,480
data to them but it shows you the error

00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:28,159
it shows you the data packet going out

00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:30,080
and this is exactly how you'd integrate

00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:32,000
with zapier zapier has endpoints that

00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,399
are so simple that you just push data

00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,760
too

00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:37,919
um i mean it's a really powerful

00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:39,760
approach to web forms i've also seen

00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:43,279
organizations make a policy of sort

00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:44,720
no data in drupal ever and always remote

00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:48,240
post it to their crm

00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:52,960
and it is a really good approach

00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:52,960
um okay i'm gonna go back to questions

00:32:54,840 --> 00:33:01,440
okay

00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:01,440
wow are there any more questions

00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:07,600
latest oh people are voting on them

00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:09,600
sorry guys that i wasn't familiar with

00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:12,000
this

00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:13,039
okay i'm gonna do with the voting system

00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,480
let's go down there

00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:17,760
okay i've answered security oh privacy

00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:20,720
and gdpr

00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:22,080
okay so i you've gotten the idea that

00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:23,039
you don't have to store data in the

00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:25,039
database

00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:26,080
but to address gdpr which is a standard

00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:27,840
that users

00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:29,200
and boy i hate the captioning got that

00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:33,279
wrong g d

00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:35,600
p r um is a standard where users need to

00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:38,320
be able to control their data

00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:40,080
and i think this is a good moment to

00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:41,440
talk about access controls because it

00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:44,000
starts to address

00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:44,640
those requirements let me find the

00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,480
section

00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:48,480
how do you limit access to a web form

00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:52,399
so we've got like four levels and these

00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:53,919
there's some more but you can set

00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:54,480
permissions i think people in the drupal

00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:56,799
community

00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:59,919
are used to that you can set form level

00:33:56,799 --> 00:34:03,279
access controls element access controls

00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:05,519
and there's a web form access module

00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:07,120
and here there's permissions and you can

00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:08,800
say who can edit what and i want to

00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:11,119
emphasize you can say anonymous

00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:12,800
not anonymous but if someone logs in

00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:14,320
that's kind of tied to gdpr

00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:16,320
is if they're giving you data you need

00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:18,320
to let them edit the data

00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:19,599
by the way this is showing you key

00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:21,280
permissions

00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:22,800
you want to pay attention to don't let

00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,839
everyone edit the source mode it's not

00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:26,480
on by default

00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:28,240
you got to turn it on but you can give

00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:30,240
people permission to access their

00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:30,879
submissions and permission to delete

00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:32,800
them

00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:34,320
and if you do that and they go to their

00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,440
user tab

00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:37,599
i'm going to actually show that because

00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:39,839
it's a hard thing to kind of emphasize

00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:42,800
i've been filling out this form and i go

00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:42,800
to my profile

00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:50,879
users get to view all their submissions

00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:50,879
and they can go in and delete them

00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:54,639
and that kind of addresses a ddpr

00:34:53,919 --> 00:34:56,320
requirement

00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:57,680
you can also delete it for that it's the

00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,400
idea of letting users own their

00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,520
information

00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:02,720
this is if you're storing it in the

00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:06,000
database um

00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:07,200
so jumping back to access controls just

00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,960
it's really important people just wear

00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,359
it you have full control you can side by

00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:13,040
roll

00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:16,160
user permission who has access to what

00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:16,960
on the form level on to who can purge

00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:20,400
view their own

00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:22,960
view all administer

00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:24,480
element levels i haven't seen anyone ask

00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:25,200
about workflows but i think it's

00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,800
important this

00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:28,560
starts to get into creating custom

00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:30,960
workflows in the webform module

00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:32,880
so you can create a form where only

00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:34,640
certain elements are accessible to

00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:37,119
administrators after someone filled out

00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:39,839
a form you could create a review process

00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:40,160
and you could give someone a rating you

00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:41,839
could

00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:44,560
do a little drop down to say this is

00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:45,119
approved or not approved that opens up a

00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,880
lot of

00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:48,240
possibilities this is admin notes just

00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:50,000
adding an admin note that's only

00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:51,440
available to admins not when you view

00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,240
the form only when you go

00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,240
and edit it

00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:59,359
other questions the best way to migrate

00:35:57,839 --> 00:36:02,560
is the web form migrate module

00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:04,079
or you re recreate your web forms

00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:05,680
people don't know this but i think it's

00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:07,280
kind of a good one

00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:10,000
you can recreate your web forms which is

00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:12,720
totally a legitimate use case

00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:15,359
and there's actually a web form input

00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:17,520
module which lets you do csv imports for

00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:18,720
small sites this is a really good simple

00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:20,400
workflow where you don't have a lot of

00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:23,040
money to build a migration

00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:25,200
for web forms and you can actually do

00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:27,200
the opposite of downloading and import a

00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:28,720
csv so you can basically take it and by

00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:30,240
the way what's powerful here is this is

00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:32,160
just not applicable for

00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:33,839
migrating this is coming from other

00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:35,440
systems this is a

00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:38,839
really quick way to get data from

00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:42,160
anywhere into your web forms

00:36:38,839 --> 00:36:44,160
um i'm gonna keep going

00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:46,000
customizing email templates there's a

00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:49,599
ton of documentation you have

00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:52,720
the ability to tweak the twig inside

00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:54,000
um if you turn on uh you know twig

00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:57,280
debugging you're going to see all the

00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,280
email templates available

00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:02,240
is there a way to purge submissions

00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:04,240
using a check box method

00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:05,680
selecting which submission to delete or

00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:08,160
not all forms

00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:11,520
no linda's asking that question when you

00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:11,520
go into the admin ui

00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:17,200
you can't here i'm going to generate 50

00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:17,200
submissions

00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:20,960
so this is the ability to use the

00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:23,599
develgenerate module to really

00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:25,359
fill this form you can't pick and choose

00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:26,240
check boxes here we just haven't done

00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:30,160
that you can do that

00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:32,960
in views but really it's a purge all

00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:34,400
or purging one by one granted you can do

00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:37,760
it here

00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:40,079
it's a fair feature to ask for

00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:40,079
okay

00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:45,839
let's see i'm going to go to latest to

00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:47,280
be fair to anyone who's posting a

00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:49,200
question that's not going to get voted

00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:51,839
up

00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:52,480
two minutes ago do users have to delete

00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:54,240
one by one

00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:56,079
is there a plan to add revisions into

00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:59,520
webform no

00:37:56,079 --> 00:38:02,320
that um there are add-ons so

00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:03,440
someone did do a revision add-on so

00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:05,599
there's

00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:06,800
two kind of things happening there's a

00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:08,960
web form submission

00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:10,560
log module that ships with the web form

00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:12,480
so it'll track all the changes that are

00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:14,720
happening to a submission

00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:16,240
um one of the challenges with revisions

00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:17,920
is what happens if someone starts

00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:19,200
changing a web form and then how do you

00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:21,280
update the submission

00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:22,320
it could become really hard to keep

00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:24,000
track of

00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:25,680
so what the submission log does it will

00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,119
keep track of the state tell you who

00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,680
updated the submission you could even

00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:30,480
see what

00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:32,079
values they updated but you can't really

00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:33,760
restore it

00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:35,839
it's kind of a middle ground there's

00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:37,040
also a module to help with that

00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:40,720
and i think you'd have to look in the

00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:40,720
add-ons um

00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:48,000
oh someone's asking about translations

00:38:44,839 --> 00:38:50,079
so you can definitely translate web

00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,359
forms it ships out of the box you can

00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:53,440
translate

00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:55,440
the form using you know it's config

00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:57,280
entities but there's a ui

00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:58,880
you don't have to create new forms you

00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:00,480
can it actually translates all the

00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:03,760
labels there's been a ton of work

00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:06,160
especially in the 6.x branch

00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:07,680
which is has some major improvements to

00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,880
just the user experience around

00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:11,119
translating web forms

00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,920
i just recommend trying it out there's

00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:15,839
some videos

00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:15,839
dedicated to it

00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:21,920
going to other latest ones accessibility

00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,280
the web 4 module i like i'm going to say

00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:24,960
it is one of the most accessible form

00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:27,200
builders on the market

00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:28,400
partially because drupal is accessible

00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:30,560
and also

00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:32,160
it's important to note that the ui in

00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:34,240
drupal is accessible that's a

00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:35,599
big change from a lot of systems

00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:37,119
especially form builders

00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:38,400
some form builders will output forms

00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:40,880
that are accessible but when you get in

00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:42,640
the ui and try to build a form it's not

00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:45,599
and the webform module you can navigate

00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:47,680
with a keyboard it has good labeling

00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:49,280
i try to do my best to do monitoring if

00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:52,160
someone comes up with an issue i look

00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:52,160
forward to fixing it

00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:56,079
lots of governments and in canada they

00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:58,560
have very

00:39:56,079 --> 00:40:00,079
strict accessibility requirements yeah

00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:01,920
canada's a great example where they have

00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:04,240
strict accessibility requirements and

00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:05,920
translation requirements so they have

00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:08,240
tested things a lot and contributed a

00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:10,319
lot to it um that's the best answer i

00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:14,079
could give there

00:40:10,319 --> 00:40:16,800
the scalability of web forms um

00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:19,359
with submissions you can have millions

00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:22,000
of submissions i have not seen

00:40:19,359 --> 00:40:22,480
an issue there i have seen some it's got

00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,319
to say

00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:26,240
some forms that were poorly built that

00:40:24,319 --> 00:40:28,640
create bottlenecks

00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:29,280
um there is a bottleneck with um if you

00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,720
have

00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:32,240
thousands of people filling out a form

00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:33,359
there's some cereals that like there's

00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:35,440
the unique id

00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:37,280
has some bottlenecks that there's some

00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:39,200
workarounds for where you can turn off

00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:41,440
the automatic generation

00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:43,760
of the basically per web form

00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:47,359
incremental id and use the global

00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:49,040
incremental id um

00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:50,480
i think when you're getting if you say

00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:51,280
you want to have 80 million submissions

00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,960
i think it's good

00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:54,400
this is a great opportunity i'm kind of

00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:57,280
near the end to plug

00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:58,240
my presentation at the gov summit i'm

00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:00,480
going to be talking about

00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:02,319
project planning for web forms and

00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:04,319
thinking these things out

00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:06,160
and you need to get your requirements up

00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:07,440
front if you're doing a site with 80

00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:10,640
million submissions

00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:10,960
then you need to think it out and plan

00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:12,240
it

00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:14,560
and the example be if you're going to

00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:15,920
have 80 million submissions and 500

00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:17,040
inputs you're going to run into a

00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:18,480
problem

00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:20,319
if you have 200 you just need to make

00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:21,920
sure you design it right i have seen

00:41:20,319 --> 00:41:23,760
sites where they've overdone conditional

00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:25,040
logic and that creates a bottleneck

00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:26,960
and it was unnecessary i want to

00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:28,720
emphasize that sometimes it's just a

00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:30,560
plan it's like being like well how do i

00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:32,560
do this as optimal

00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:34,160
as possible and i'm going to talk about

00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:36,480
that a lot at the gov summit it's going

00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:39,520
to be totally different deck

00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:41,359
um okay

00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:43,119
oh someone's asked about moving web

00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:45,200
forms from environment to environment

00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:46,640
web forms are configuration entities

00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:49,760
that's the system you want to get

00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:51,599
familiar with and basically

00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:53,599
you can do lots of different tricks with

00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:54,480
that that's a powerful thing in the web

00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:55,839
form

00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:57,040
uh not web form but drupal's

00:41:55,839 --> 00:41:58,240
configuration system so there's an

00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:59,599
export tab

00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:01,200
and this allows you and there's some

00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:02,800
notes about this that you can this is

00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:04,960
the web forms configuration that you

00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:06,640
could download and literally copy onto

00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:08,240
another site this is just one workflow

00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:11,440
to address that

00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:13,520
that requirement um

00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:16,160
it you got to get familiar i have a

00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:18,240
dedicated blog post about managing

00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:19,280
web form configuration and go into it

00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:21,920
more

00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:24,160
um i find this incred by the way if you

00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:25,280
have an issue this is an awesome way you

00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:28,560
duplicate the issue

00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:29,920
you download this and

00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:32,960
then you can put it in the web form

00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:34,640
issue queue my god we've got a huge

00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:36,160
number of questions okay

00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:38,880
sharepoint integration it has to be

00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:42,400
dedicated module i don't know

00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:42,960
um pros and cons of web forms first

00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,480
content

00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:46,079
it's a hard one to address but it's just

00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:48,400
a performance thing

00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:50,400
you can content types get better

00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:52,319
integration with drupal core

00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:54,240
but you can't have hundreds of

00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:55,920
individual content types but you can

00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:58,560
have hundreds of web forms

00:42:55,920 --> 00:43:01,040
with hundreds of fields and that's it's

00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:03,280
kind of the decision between the two

00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:04,960
that you have to think about um depend

00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:06,319
like if you're building a very rich

00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:08,319
application and you only have two or

00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:09,920
three forms i would lean toward using

00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:12,720
content types or the contact

00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:15,760
module on core but if i have hundreds of

00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:17,520
forms the web form tends to address it

00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:20,000
address validation with google maps

00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:21,520
there's a web form location module that

00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,920
does have google map

00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:25,119
integration it's kind of deprecated

00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:27,359
because the library

00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:29,119
is no longer maintained there is a

00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:32,400
support for algolia to do location

00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:35,119
validation which is very nice

00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:36,319
um let's see what other all right now

00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:38,480
i'm going to switch gears

00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:41,119
and vote well if i go back to the latest

00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:43,119
we're at the five minute mark

00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:46,400
um i'm gonna switch the chat for a

00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:48,720
second because i got five minutes left

00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:48,720
okay

00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:57,920
i'm um for a second to breathe i can

00:43:55,839 --> 00:43:58,640
stay on after this stays open so i'm

00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:02,079
going to

00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:04,160
basically take questions in five minutes

00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:05,680
and try to wrap up a little bit because

00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:06,839
there might be something i missed

00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:09,680
because i'm just

00:44:06,839 --> 00:44:11,440
talking non-stop

00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:13,599
we can look at this we've gone through a

00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:17,280
lot not all which is totally

00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:17,280
fine um

00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:22,160
let's see i like that i put stars in

00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:25,359
because we covered

00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:27,520
most of the star things that

00:44:25,359 --> 00:44:29,520
stars are important things that need to

00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:32,000
go through

00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:33,520
i'm going to work on wrapping up i'm

00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:36,720
going to

00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:38,160
talk about getting help so

00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:39,920
because i'm not going to answer all your

00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:41,680
questions here how do you get help with

00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:44,640
the web 4 module

00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:46,800
well there's a documentation there's a

00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:50,079
cookbook there's screencasts in the ui

00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:52,160
on drupal.org drupal answers is the best

00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:53,680
place every single question that someone

00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:56,000
asked should go to drupal answers and

00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:57,520
actually not the web form issue queue

00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,119
because first you wanted to see if this

00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:00,560
is supported or someone has some

00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:03,119
knowledge about it

00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:04,000
if you find bugs or you really need a

00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:05,599
feature

00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,280
that makes sense you can go to the issue

00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:09,680
queue

00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:10,560
and i mean some people are following my

00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:12,560
blog

00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:14,000
you know i you got to go to my blog to

00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:15,440
kind of understand what to drupal or not

00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,440
to drupal means but you know my

00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:18,720
organization's moving away from drupal

00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:20,079
i still want to maintain the webflow

00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:21,440
module so i'm trying to figure out how

00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:23,920
to make

00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:25,760
my effort more sustainable i used to

00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:27,359
have a couple of slides about that and

00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:30,000
i've kind of optimized it because

00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:30,480
i updated the project page recently to

00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,560
kind of

00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:34,160
encourage people one always to encourage

00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:35,760
people to get involved

00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:38,319
there is an open collective where you

00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:39,599
can help fund development at this point

00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:41,440
i'm going to start using these open

00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:44,400
collective funds to deal with the issue

00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:46,800
queue and to go and fix bugs

00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:48,000
and finally i'm making very clear that

00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:49,440
if someone's doing

00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,119
by the way i think this is why i'm doing

00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:53,520
the gov summit presentation

00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:54,240
if you're doing a big web form project

00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:56,640
hire me

00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:58,560
for support because i can help you

00:45:56,640 --> 00:46:01,119
before you start having problems

00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:02,800
and avoid them i can tell you i know

00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:05,280
it's worth the money i've been on

00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:06,800
projects that have had major problems on

00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:08,960
a call with

00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:10,560
78 developers trying to figure out the

00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:11,839
problem that if i was there from the

00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:12,640
beginning i would have said don't do it

00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:14,000
that way

00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:16,960
i would have prevented that from

00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:19,520
happening so it's definitely worth

00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:20,640
you know bringing in the expert or the

00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:22,599
sme

00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:24,400
um and you can learn more about me at

00:46:22,599 --> 00:46:28,319
jrockowitz.com

00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:30,480
i'm gonna stay on wow the number is huge

00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:32,480
we're at like 400.

00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:34,319
i'll stay on as long as there's people

00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:35,760
in the chat and there's questions being

00:46:34,319 --> 00:46:37,839
asked

00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:39,839
thank you everyone for the comments

00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:40,800
attending i mean this is the largest

00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:43,920
turnout i've

00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:48,240
ever had um

00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:51,520
god bless virtual for that um

00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:53,119
let me take a sip of water yeah and bill

00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:55,680
thank you so much for posting

00:46:53,119 --> 00:46:58,160
the survey and the the slides over and

00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:58,160
over again

00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:02,800
so as people kind of sign off with the

00:47:01,359 --> 00:47:05,920
numbers are going down i'm going to go

00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:08,000
to the q a i am going to sort them

00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:09,359
by the latest so that i can you know

00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,720
really that means someone's here and

00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:11,359
they're asking a question and want me so

00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:13,520
you could

00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:15,040
please repost your question if i did not

00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:17,599
answer it

00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:19,680
um can you create a blocker component of

00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:22,000
form fields for example name address

00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:24,559
yes that is a great question at least

00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:26,720
asking about composite elements

00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:28,000
i it always goes down a rabbit hole so i

00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:28,319
don't go there that much but i'm going

00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,720
to

00:47:28,319 --> 00:47:32,480
do go there here in the ui and demo but

00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:33,520
i'm surprised i did not do a lot of

00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:35,599
demos so

00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:38,720
let's add a composite element to this

00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:40,400
and talk about that so composite

00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:41,680
elements and i did have that in the deck

00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:43,680
but are multiple

00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:45,440
inputs working together so i can click

00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:46,480
add element and these are some out of

00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:48,960
the box so if i do

00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:49,920
address there's two composites there's a

00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:51,599
basic address

00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:53,599
and advanced advanced address is the

00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:54,800
address module basic is the one i want

00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:57,200
to work on

00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:58,319
this is by the way out of the box a

00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:59,680
bunch of

00:47:58,319 --> 00:48:02,880
you can collect an address so let's just

00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:02,880
look at this address

00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:07,040
you have address one two you can tweak

00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:08,319
little settings about it

00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:09,760
i'm not gonna go too far i'm just gonna

00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:12,079
show it to you by the way you can say

00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:13,520
you wanna collect multiple addresses

00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:16,240
i won't do that right now but i'm gonna

00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:20,880
hit save and show you the

00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:22,800
output so this is

00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:24,079
a composite element you're collecting an

00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:28,480
address

00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:28,480
now i can also go in

00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:31,920
and you can even collect multiple

00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:34,240
addresses but what's more powerful the

00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:35,839
demo to answer that question about

00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:37,760
composites is if i do a search for

00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:40,880
composite

00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:42,240
and create a custom composite this is

00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:45,119
like your own version to collect

00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:49,200
multiple values so if i say custom

00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:50,480
composites let's just do

00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:52,400
let's say you're going to get an event

00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:56,079
registration system first name

00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:59,680
oh wait this is the key first

00:48:56,079 --> 00:49:02,880
name first

00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:05,839
name text field

00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:05,839
i'm gonna add one

00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:10,240
sorry that i scrolled last name

00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:17,839
by the way see

00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:21,520
that's nice client side validation kick

00:49:20,319 --> 00:49:24,720
in

00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:30,000
there we go text field

00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:33,760
i'm going to hit save

00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:37,359
gonna go here and

00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:39,520
you get this awesome custom composite

00:49:37,359 --> 00:49:40,640
that you can collect multiple values

00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:43,599
with

00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:44,160
this is incredibly flexible elements so

00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:45,839
every

00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:48,960
single widget or piece you're seeing

00:49:45,839 --> 00:49:52,559
here you can tweak

00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:54,160
this and you can you can say i want plus

00:49:52,559 --> 00:49:55,839
and minus is yours i don't want them i

00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:58,079
want 10 default items

00:49:55,839 --> 00:49:59,920
you can do that you can make the

00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:02,160
sortable or not sortable

00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:03,680
incredibly powerful feature you can also

00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:04,800
write these in code i'm not i didn't go

00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:06,160
into code but

00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:08,000
i do make a note that if you're building

00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:09,359
a large site writing a custom composite

00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,839
in code is really good because it's

00:50:09,359 --> 00:50:14,079
stable

00:50:10,839 --> 00:50:14,559
um uh dana's asking how to make contact

00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:17,520
with me

00:50:14,559 --> 00:50:19,040
my website there's a contact us form

00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:20,559
there if you want to hire me that's the

00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:21,440
best place if you don't want to hire me

00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:23,200
use

00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:25,200
the web form issue queue post your

00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:26,640
questions there i try to you know get to

00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:28,720
them as much as i can

00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:31,119
that's why i like drupal answers because

00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:34,640
other people can help with it

00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:38,079
um wow we're still at 300 i know people

00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:38,079
are eating right now too but

00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:43,680
uh let's see any other

00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:45,280
yeah you're gonna have to repost your

00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:45,599
questions i'm gonna start wrapping this

00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:49,599
up

00:50:45,599 --> 00:50:49,599
we're only two minutes over which is not

00:50:49,839 --> 00:50:55,920
a big thing

00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:57,280
reading through branching logic well

00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:58,480
that's conditional logic if someone's

00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:00,000
talking about branching you do

00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:02,079
conditional logic

00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:04,079
and um multi-step forms support

00:51:02,079 --> 00:51:05,920
conditional logic on each step so you

00:51:04,079 --> 00:51:09,599
can branch from there

00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:11,200
um i mean i yeah i didn't talk a lot

00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:13,200
about multi-steps which it really

00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:14,559
it's been it's evolved a lot in the last

00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:16,079
few years because there's a new system

00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:22,000
called cards

00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:25,680
which if there's okay

00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:27,599
um let's see

00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:29,520
i i'm not going to do cards because adam

00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:31,760
asked a question is there a way to post

00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:35,760
web form submission to a block

00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:37,440
or paint um you can do stuff with views

00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:39,119
like if you want to show results you can

00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:39,760
do views and embed them on different

00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:41,280
pages

00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:42,880
there are a lot of web form blocks that

00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:43,920
you can kind of play with um they'll

00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:45,920
show count oh

00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:47,760
there's blocks to show counters that

00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:49,119
help a lot like if you want to build an

00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:50,000
event registration system and you want

00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:52,960
to count the number

00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:54,319
of available slots there's a lot and

00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:55,040
that's a submission limit so there's

00:51:54,319 --> 00:51:59,680
lots of

00:51:55,040 --> 00:52:01,839
there um how to pre-populate a wizard

00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:04,559
if a visitor is known to a market oh

00:52:01,839 --> 00:52:06,079
yeah crm

00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:08,480
well that's where handlers kick in

00:52:06,079 --> 00:52:11,839
nicely is handlers allow you to tweak

00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:13,760
any aspect of a web form so this is like

00:52:11,839 --> 00:52:15,040
if you want to do a good crm integration

00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:16,559
you have a developer create a handler

00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:16,960
and then you decide how you want that to

00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:18,559
work

00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:21,119
and it could definitely pre-populate the

00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:22,880
values based on the user account

00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:24,480
that's that's really how people are

00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:25,920
doing it um

00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:27,520
if you want a really tight integration i

00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:29,920
generally lean to writing your custom

00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:29,920
handler

00:52:31,119 --> 00:52:35,440
can you create a web form on the fly

00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:36,720
looks like one form to the user but

00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:38,319
pretending on the value set in the

00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:40,400
database

00:52:38,319 --> 00:52:41,760
oh enclosure doesn't include certain

00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:44,319
parts okay so

00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:46,000
conditional logic does get you there

00:52:44,319 --> 00:52:48,720
there's also a system called

00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:49,920
variance that allows you to personalize

00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:52,240
a web form

00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:53,599
there's a dedicated video to it i don't

00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:56,960
know if i have a great example let me

00:52:53,599 --> 00:52:56,960
see if i have a variant example

00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:04,720
so variants get i do

00:53:01,599 --> 00:53:06,960
oh let's see if we have a good example

00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:06,960
here

00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:12,079
ah i'm gonna look i mean basically what

00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:13,680
variants do allow you to make subtle

00:53:12,079 --> 00:53:15,359
tweaks of the form based on the audience

00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:17,839
type so you could say

00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:19,680
i use it in healthcare if a person's a

00:53:17,839 --> 00:53:20,960
patient i show them one type of form if

00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:22,960
they're a caregiver i show them

00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:24,800
it's the same form but i'm changing

00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:27,040
every this is important conditional

00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:29,760
logic allows you to hide and show things

00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:31,680
that is not personalization that's hide

00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:33,440
and showing

00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:35,440
what you really want to get into is you

00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:37,040
want to change the labels of the form

00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:39,920
if a patient's filling out a form you

00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:41,920
might say enter your contact information

00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:43,599
the caregiver is entering filling out a

00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:46,160
form you want to say enter the patient's

00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:48,240
contact information

00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:50,079
i actually tend not to demo it because

00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:53,359
it's such a complex thing there is a

00:53:50,079 --> 00:53:55,920
dedicated video about this

00:53:53,359 --> 00:53:57,599
um oh yeah see the variance i'm just

00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:59,760
going to show you the ui and the idea

00:53:57,599 --> 00:54:02,079
what i have i have built forms with

00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:04,160
massive amounts of variations

00:54:02,079 --> 00:54:05,599
so basically the form has a text field

00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:06,960
but you could test by the way what's

00:54:05,599 --> 00:54:07,440
cool about variants is you can do a b

00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:08,839
testing

00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:10,640
because it has little pieces of

00:54:08,839 --> 00:54:12,400
functionality so

00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:13,680
i can go in here and say i would like to

00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:16,400
test a variant

00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:17,359
i would like a long form for an

00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:19,760
organization called

00:54:17,359 --> 00:54:21,119
a and it will generate a test and you

00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:22,480
can also display this on your site and

00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:24,319
the idea is

00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:25,760
here's the form type it's a long form

00:54:24,319 --> 00:54:26,800
this old i'm just showing data in the

00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:28,640
back end

00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:31,440
but now i'm saying hello to organization

00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:34,640
a and i'm giving them a text field

00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:38,240
a really powerful feature

00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:41,280
um okay

00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:43,119
anonymous do you suggest or are you

00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:45,200
included in a resource to learn about

00:54:43,119 --> 00:54:46,799
web forms step by step from a novice to

00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:48,160
expert

00:54:46,799 --> 00:54:51,200
that's a great question this is

00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:52,799
something i have to start working out

00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:54,559
frankly if an organization asked me to

00:54:52,799 --> 00:54:55,839
do training i would do it in a heartbeat

00:54:54,559 --> 00:54:57,680
i think it would be a real if an

00:54:55,839 --> 00:55:00,319
organization's

00:54:57,680 --> 00:55:01,520
going head head first into drupal and

00:55:00,319 --> 00:55:03,359
they're going dxp

00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:04,720
and aqua and they're going to use web

00:55:03,359 --> 00:55:07,440
forms as part of their

00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:07,920
their project they should probably bring

00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:10,000
me in

00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:10,960
and have me help them walk through it i

00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:13,040
do have those

00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:14,880
videos throughout the webform module to

00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:16,559
help you go from novice

00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:18,240
to an expert and i just want to say like

00:55:16,559 --> 00:55:19,920
the example is

00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:21,200
i'm just showing this and there was a a

00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:23,280
slide of this there's just videos

00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:25,839
walking through each step

00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:27,520
um i don't have a step by step from

00:55:25,839 --> 00:55:29,520
novice to expert keep in mind i tried to

00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:32,240
make this as novice as possible while

00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:34,319
advanced as possible so most people can

00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:38,240
start building forms from day one

00:55:34,319 --> 00:55:42,000
okay ah let's see

00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:42,000
wow there's still 250 people here

00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:46,960
is there a way to add a field which

00:55:44,799 --> 00:55:48,000
allows unlimited files attachments to a

00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:49,440
d7

00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:51,920
web form submission can't answer that

00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:55,760
because i don't know d7 sorry

00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:58,799
uh oh will web forms have views blocks

00:55:55,760 --> 00:56:00,720
operations to resubmit and number of

00:55:58,799 --> 00:56:02,720
previous submissions i don't totally

00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:04,319
understand that i'm sorry

00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:06,160
can i access fields inside a composite

00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:10,319
individually for handlers

00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:11,440
um yes and no sometimes it depends on

00:56:10,319 --> 00:56:13,440
the use case i mean if you build your

00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:14,880
own custom handlers absolutely

00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:17,599
for rendering those are individual

00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:18,559
values like the example would be here's

00:56:17,599 --> 00:56:20,240
the challenge i have

00:56:18,559 --> 00:56:21,440
i'm trying to generate a spreadsheet i

00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:23,359
have a comp there's a question about

00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:26,400
composites i have a composite element

00:56:23,359 --> 00:56:26,799
it's very hard to represent something

00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:29,040
that's

00:56:26,799 --> 00:56:30,799
a composite multiple values that are

00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:32,640
unlimited in a spreadsheet

00:56:30,799 --> 00:56:34,640
and what happens in that scenario is

00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:36,880
we're dumping yaml into the column and

00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:39,839
that is parsable but it's not the ideal

00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:43,119
situation in that case you might need to

00:56:39,839 --> 00:56:46,160
look at the data as xml

00:56:43,119 --> 00:56:48,960
um is there a way to update

00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:50,720
the contact form to break the name into

00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:51,920
oh

00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:53,760
i didn't answer that question you could

00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:55,520
break the contact element to break the

00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:56,559
name field into the first and last name

00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:58,480
either

00:56:56,559 --> 00:57:00,720
this specific element oh the contact

00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:02,400
element no okay

00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:04,319
i now understand this question so you're

00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:05,440
asking so someone's asked about this

00:57:04,319 --> 00:57:07,359
contact element

00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:09,440
and i guess what the question comes down

00:57:07,359 --> 00:57:13,119
to and i know i'm on this forum but

00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:15,839
i can kind of illustrate it here

00:57:13,119 --> 00:57:18,480
if i had add element and search for

00:57:15,839 --> 00:57:18,480
contact

00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:24,160
you get this element which is like an

00:57:21,359 --> 00:57:26,319
address recollecting contact information

00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:27,680
it has a name it's not broken into first

00:57:26,319 --> 00:57:29,599
and last name and i'll just show you the

00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:32,079
element hit save

00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:33,119
and they need it broken down the answer

00:57:32,079 --> 00:57:34,720
really is uh

00:57:33,119 --> 00:57:37,040
i can't even go there the answer really

00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:39,200
is you're gonna have to either

00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:41,119
you're gonna have to copy and extend

00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:44,480
this and make the change

00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:45,280
but what i can talk about is there's

00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:49,839
examples of

00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:52,559
everything so if i go into

00:57:49,839 --> 00:57:55,119
extends there's a webform example

00:57:52,559 --> 00:57:56,640
composite module which shows you

00:57:55,119 --> 00:57:58,079
how to build your own composite so you

00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:59,440
can basically create your own contact

00:57:58,079 --> 00:58:00,079
element with the first and last name

00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:01,680
separate

00:58:00,079 --> 00:58:04,559
you could also in that example just

00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:07,200
extend the existing context so if i do

00:58:04,559 --> 00:58:09,920
composite

00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:11,520
you see there's an example composite and

00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:12,799
that's really code snippet that you can

00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:14,240
you can go in there and copy it shows

00:58:12,799 --> 00:58:16,400
you kind of the

00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:17,440
there's a nuance for any developer is

00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:20,319
you need to create a

00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:21,760
form api element and a web form element

00:58:20,319 --> 00:58:23,280
so that there's a bridge between

00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:24,720
drupal's form api and the web form

00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:26,400
module and that's what these examples

00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:28,559
are kind of getting to

00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:31,200
and once you have that those two pieces

00:58:28,559 --> 00:58:32,960
set up you're pretty much good to go

00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:34,400
and i can't get into the code but it's

00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:36,640
literally a render array

00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:39,440
and when i say render array by the way i

00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:39,440
can go back to

00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:48,480
this little thing form api render arrays

00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:50,240
i have a slide about this in the

00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:52,400
example of a composite you're going to

00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:54,079
see code like this it's literally

00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:55,760
you're just listing out what you want

00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:57,680
the composite to look like and this is

00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:59,920
form api this is just saying what type

00:58:57,680 --> 00:59:01,680
elements a text field and name

00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:04,079
and it really can get you going pretty

00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:04,079
fast

00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:14,559
crm you referred to crm several times

00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:16,559
that's a

00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:19,760
customer relational management database

00:59:16,559 --> 00:59:21,839
so it's the idea of like salesforce

00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:23,280
they're the experts on managing user

00:59:21,839 --> 00:59:25,040
data and

00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:26,640
web forms are pretty much engaging in

00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:28,319
your users and collecting data and

00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:31,119
that's why i keep talking about crms

00:59:28,319 --> 00:59:32,720
because in the enterprise

00:59:31,119 --> 00:59:34,960
more and more i would just recommend

00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:36,240
having a crm and not using drupal to

00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:37,839
store your user data

00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:39,359
you know the user data in drupal should

00:59:37,839 --> 00:59:41,280
be about people who are building pages

00:59:39,359 --> 00:59:43,359
or content

00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:45,520
just a direction it depends on the scale

00:59:43,359 --> 00:59:47,359
of your site

00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:48,799
even similar like with comments lots of

00:59:47,359 --> 00:59:49,920
people use third party to manage their

00:59:48,799 --> 00:59:52,319
comments

00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:53,520
so crm it's just a matter of someone's

00:59:52,319 --> 00:59:54,960
filling out a form do you really need

00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:56,799
that data in drupal are you going to do

00:59:54,960 --> 01:00:01,839
a lot of date with that data in drupal

00:59:56,799 --> 01:00:01,839
if you're not put it into your crm

01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:04,400
okay

01:00:04,590 --> 01:00:07,849
[Music]

01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:12,839
oh so someone's really asking about

01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:15,520
translations this is um

01:00:12,839 --> 01:00:17,680
hmm

01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:18,640
i can answer it best but boy i want to

01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:20,160
just go to my

01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:22,880
you don't have to rebuild the form every

01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:24,799
time um

01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:26,240
there's videos dedicated to walking

01:00:24,799 --> 01:00:28,400
through web form translations and

01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:30,480
basically i see i don't have that on

01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:32,240
probably should for the demos they do is

01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:33,760
you get a tab on the web form

01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:35,200
and you can go and translate just the

01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:36,319
labels of the elements you don't have to

01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:38,640
build a new form

01:00:36,319 --> 01:00:40,000
and i i mean i do a lot of translations

01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:43,599
with web forms

01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:45,359
i hope ted that answers it um

01:00:43,599 --> 01:00:48,240
i can direct you so when i say there's

01:00:45,359 --> 01:00:51,839
help videos if i go here

01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:51,839
and do a search for translations

01:00:52,079 --> 01:00:55,359
this dedicated video about translations

01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:57,520
i link to

01:00:55,359 --> 01:00:59,040
some notes on drupal.org i do have a

01:00:57,520 --> 01:01:01,040
blog post on my blog

01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:02,160
about the improvements of translations

01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:03,839
in core

01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:05,920
i mean this is a good opportunity to

01:01:03,839 --> 01:01:09,280
plug that i'll go there

01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:11,920
um here we'll scroll down

01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:12,400
let my blog load ah shouldn't be this

01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:15,599
slow

01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:17,440
we just max my machine out

01:01:15,599 --> 01:01:19,280
all right it's funny i call this a

01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:21,280
mistake because i've improved the

01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:22,480
the experience but what's important here

01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:24,480
is so

01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:25,920
previously you could just this is the ui

01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:29,200
and drupal 6. uh no

01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:31,040
in drupal 8 in 5.x branch where it's

01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:32,720
just you're editing the yaml and we

01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:34,720
improved it where

01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:36,640
you're just editing the label so this is

01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:37,119
when you get turn on all the translation

01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:38,960
stuff

01:01:37,119 --> 01:01:40,480
you can click on translate this contact

01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:42,480
form into spanish

01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:44,400
and go in and just change the labels of

01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:45,040
it i hope this helps this is a good blog

01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:48,160
post

01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:50,319
it's on my blog jayrockwoods.com

01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:53,520
um i'm going to go down there's some

01:01:50,319 --> 01:01:57,680
questions from 10 minutes ago

01:01:53,520 --> 01:02:00,000
okay i'm surprised there's 200 people

01:01:57,680 --> 01:02:01,920
still in the room

01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:04,480
i'm gonna go to the chat and see what's

01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:04,480
going on there

01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:09,039
will this session recording after the

01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:12,240
official session end up i think this

01:02:09,039 --> 01:02:14,720
oh i don't know if the recording

01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:17,119
will uh keep going uh that's a good

01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:17,119
question

01:02:19,359 --> 01:02:24,160
mike you just made me laugh so basically

01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:25,690
you're eating a sandwich while

01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:29,520
you're uh

01:02:25,690 --> 01:02:32,640
[Laughter]

01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:34,960
uh wow do stakeholder reviews on forums

01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:37,839
okay so let me see if there's anything

01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:37,839
i'm missing in here

01:02:38,799 --> 01:02:42,640
ah bob you're asking a great question so

01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:44,240
how do i pre-populate

01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:45,920
web form components from a node where

01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:47,359
the node id is passed to a web form for

01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:48,160
your url parameters you can definitely

01:02:47,359 --> 01:02:50,240
do that

01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:51,760
it's a source entity id and i'm actually

01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:54,559
i have slides on that

01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:55,599
so i'm going to do that let me see if i

01:02:54,559 --> 01:02:58,880
can get there

01:02:55,599 --> 01:03:00,960
i i like this this is this concept

01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:02,480
behind a form so a source signing tracks

01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:04,079
and creates a relationship from the

01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:04,880
drupal name from which a web form was

01:03:04,079 --> 01:03:07,119
submitted

01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:08,960
a node a web form is attached to a node

01:03:07,119 --> 01:03:10,880
the node is the entity

01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:13,599
laos web forms are used multiple times

01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:15,200
and it's the current route so you could

01:03:13,599 --> 01:03:17,200
if a web form is attached to a node it

01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:19,039
will no it's on a node

01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:22,000
and look at the current route it also

01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:24,160
can be passed through the query string

01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:25,760
and this is just showing you in the ui

01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:27,440
if you had an event registration system

01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:30,000
you'd see this column called submitted2

01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:31,839
and those are individual nodes

01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:33,760
and i want to answer your question about

01:03:31,839 --> 01:03:35,920
the url and just get you to the settings

01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:35,920
so

01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:41,440
let's go here i have an event

01:03:39,839 --> 01:03:42,079
registration demo and i'm going to go to

01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:43,200
this form

01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:45,839
and just walk through some of the

01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:45,839
settings here

01:03:46,799 --> 01:03:50,240
so if you go to forms there's behaviors

01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:51,599
and

01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:53,319
i didn't get into this there's lots of

01:03:51,599 --> 01:03:55,039
check boxes but at the bottom is all the

01:03:53,319 --> 01:03:57,039
pre-population

01:03:55,039 --> 01:03:58,079
so you could pre-populate values on the

01:03:57,039 --> 01:04:00,000
form but there's a checkbox

01:03:58,079 --> 01:04:01,359
to pre-populate the source entity and it

01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:04,240
will walk you through

01:04:01,359 --> 01:04:04,720
the parameters so you can go in and when

01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:06,400
something

01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:08,720
you could direct someone to a form and

01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:11,119
say well the source entity type is node

01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:12,960
and the id is one two you know one this

01:04:11,119 --> 01:04:14,799
is also used when you open web forms and

01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:16,160
modal dialogues this is heavily used

01:04:14,799 --> 01:04:17,680
because those modal dialogues are

01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:19,200
separate pages

01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:21,680
there's also these check boxes for

01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:24,720
validation and tracking

01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:26,799
very powerful this is also applied to

01:04:24,720 --> 01:04:28,480
shared web forms so you can pass that

01:04:26,799 --> 01:04:32,000
into a shared web form

01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:34,400
i hope that answers um that question

01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:38,839
that bob asked

01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:40,079
okay yeah everyone's doing their

01:04:38,839 --> 01:04:42,400
sandwiches

01:04:40,079 --> 01:04:44,160
multiple okay yeah also these are great

01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:47,200
questions i can't believe how many well

01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:49,200
you get 400 people on a call

01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:51,119
oh is there a good way to set up a web

01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:52,240
form to have some intro questions in a

01:04:51,119 --> 01:04:54,880
block that

01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:56,559
yes that is really supported there's

01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:57,760
like some intro questions so you put the

01:04:56,559 --> 01:04:59,119
block up there and you say hey

01:04:57,760 --> 01:05:01,440
start filling out the form and then

01:04:59,119 --> 01:05:03,440
after they submit they go to the next

01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:06,720
question i think there's a way to jump

01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:09,920
it off i'd have to look it's a great

01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:11,200
question let me see if it's not it

01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:14,240
should be a feature

01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:17,440
um one trick

01:05:14,240 --> 01:05:17,760
this is a really crazy trick is there's

01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:19,680
a

01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:22,480
really popular video and this question

01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:24,000
okay so a web form in a block that then

01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:24,480
goes to what you know like you click

01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,640
submit

01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:28,079
it goes to a different web form it

01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:31,359
reminds me of

01:05:28,079 --> 01:05:33,599
there's a video it's

01:05:31,359 --> 01:05:35,119
really popular because it shows the

01:05:33,599 --> 01:05:38,319
scenario

01:05:35,119 --> 01:05:40,880
so if i go over to help and i do

01:05:38,319 --> 01:05:40,880
views

01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:51,839
that's not it oh boy give me a second

01:05:55,119 --> 01:06:01,520
ah i guess i'm stuck describing it

01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:03,680
okay here's the scenario you can create

01:06:01,520 --> 01:06:04,079
kind of like a starter web form so you

01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:05,599
have your

01:06:04,079 --> 01:06:07,119
massive form let's say you have 400

01:06:05,599 --> 01:06:08,160
questions on that form if you want to

01:06:07,119 --> 01:06:09,200
just show some of the first two

01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:11,359
questions in a block

01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:13,119
create a new web form called web form

01:06:11,359 --> 01:06:14,559
starter and it doesn't need to save

01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:16,640
anything to the database

01:06:14,559 --> 01:06:19,039
they start filling out that form and

01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:19,599
they click submit and then you redirect

01:06:19,039 --> 01:06:21,680
them

01:06:19,599 --> 01:06:22,880
to the master form with the values

01:06:21,680 --> 01:06:25,039
passed in the url where you're

01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:27,280
pre-populating those values

01:06:25,039 --> 01:06:29,760
it's a really great pattern it's also

01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:31,440
usable for views so that

01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:32,880
you create a web form that's like you

01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:34,400
know views have filters like you could

01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:35,920
have massive drop downs it gets really

01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:38,079
complex but maybe you just want a block

01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:39,520
on your homepage that says search for

01:06:38,079 --> 01:06:41,039
this piece of information and select

01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:41,520
this drop down you can use web forms for

01:06:41,039 --> 01:06:43,280
that

01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:45,119
and basically you disconnect the web

01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:46,799
form from the back end where just a form

01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:50,000
where someone's hit submit

01:06:46,799 --> 01:06:53,039
and it redirects to the view with

01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:55,760
the exposed filter pre-populated

01:06:53,039 --> 01:06:57,200
it's a really good pattern if you ask in

01:06:55,760 --> 01:06:58,000
drupal answers people will actually help

01:06:57,200 --> 01:06:59,359
you with it

01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:01,599
i see people are throwing up stuff in

01:06:59,359 --> 01:07:04,240
the q a so i'm going to hop back there

01:07:01,599 --> 01:07:04,880
luke any out of the box integrations

01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:08,079
advanced

01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:09,680
visual advisors no all of that's being

01:07:08,079 --> 01:07:11,440
handled by third parties

01:07:09,680 --> 01:07:13,359
i think we just there's a web form

01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:14,960
analytics module

01:07:13,359 --> 01:07:17,119
zapier that's kind of why i push people

01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:18,160
to crms because crm can crunch the data

01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:22,400
better

01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:24,160
than um i could in drupal

01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:25,680
let's see in the chat oh well it's great

01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:27,599
there's a little red thing okay people

01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:29,680
are just saying thank you

01:07:27,599 --> 01:07:32,319
wow yeah 8 pm oh i forgot you're not

01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:35,359
eating sandwiches you're eating dinner

01:07:32,319 --> 01:07:38,400
um yes please provide

01:07:35,359 --> 01:07:40,319
feedback it helps a lot to get it

01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:42,480
this was the first time i tried this

01:07:40,319 --> 01:07:44,880
massive kind of like

01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:45,920
smorgasbord session where i'm just

01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:48,079
giving you

01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:49,200
more information than we could possibly

01:07:48,079 --> 01:07:53,359
go through

01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:53,359
and i've gone 20 minutes over

01:07:53,599 --> 01:07:56,640
yeah i like the three fun i'd like to

01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:59,119
give three

01:07:56,640 --> 01:08:00,000
thumbs up wow say that three times in a

01:07:59,119 --> 01:08:03,280
row

01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:04,000
um okay we're at 187 the numbers are

01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:05,440
going down

01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:07,520
i think people should enjoy their

01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:09,440
sandwiches

01:08:07,520 --> 01:08:10,960
and their dinner enjoy the rest of

01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:12,640
drupalcon

01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:14,480
um if you really like this session i

01:08:12,640 --> 01:08:16,159
know there's 187 people i think it might

01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:17,920
be worth checking the gov summit session

01:08:16,159 --> 01:08:20,880
now especially if you have big projects

01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:21,920
um oh thank you ivan for plugging my uh

01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:27,359
funding

01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:31,839

01:08:35,279 --> 01:08:38,719

01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:40,159
pandemic is over so we can go back to

01:08:38,719 --> 01:08:42,080
normal

01:08:40,159 --> 01:08:45,359

with your registration so yeah

01:08:45,359 --> 01:08:48,159
maybe we do by the way i think if you're

01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:49,359
tweeting about this tweet that you

01:08:48,159 --> 01:08:52,960

01:08:49,359 --> 01:08:55,109
besides watching this video um

01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:58,000

to my blog is jrockowitz.com uh

01:09:04,839 --> 01:09:07,839
https

01:09:10,319 --> 01:09:15,279

01:09:15,279 --> 01:09:17,520

oh boy the redirect on

01:09:24,159 --> 01:09:28,000
i just saw the redirects broken on

01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:29,839
strikingly by the way i don't use drupal

01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:31,359
but i think that's very funny

01:09:29,839 --> 01:09:32,400
yeah guff summit yeah jessica i love

01:09:31,359 --> 01:09:33,440
that guff summits at the end of the

01:09:32,400 --> 01:09:35,520
month i can't

01:09:33,440 --> 01:09:38,000
as the best thing they ever did for

01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:40,000
presenters is to spread out the summits

01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:41,440
it makes it possible for people to kind

01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:44,400
of balance their time a little better

01:09:41,440 --> 01:09:46,159
um i made me like because yeah i could

01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:48,400
just look forward to it

01:09:46,159 --> 01:09:50,080
in you know at the end of the month and

01:09:48,400 --> 01:09:51,759
i haven't even finished the deck yet but

01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:54,239

01:09:54,239 --> 01:09:56,560
um

01:09:57,840 --> 01:10:02,080
