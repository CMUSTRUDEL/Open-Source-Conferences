excellent time for me to wear my

00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,159
drupalcon shirts but i wore them all out

00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,040
during the week and have had no time for

00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:48,960
laundry so

00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,560

00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,200

that was a slight about dries's

00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:09,120
challenge to see if we can expand our

00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:11,440
drupalcon engineering team to get that

00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,199

that are going to last us through the

00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,720
rest of the year and beyond

00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:34,639

engagement it's great to see that this

00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:38,400
experiment this year of doing a

00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,320
really heavily contribution-focused

00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,080
drupalcon went so very well

00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,919
and that so many people participated and

00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:46,160
picked it out

00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:48,160
yeah and and just a special thanks to

00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,400
everybody that made that transition with

00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,080
us

00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,080
because it was a pretty tight turnaround

00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:54,000
by the time in late december

00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,759
when we said hey we want to really we

00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,280
want to go all in and contribution it's

00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:58,960
a strategic objective

00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,479
and we want to better enable people to

00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,840
be able to contribute in a way that

00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:02,800
works for them and that drives the

00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,240
project forward

00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,840
so it's a quick turnaround for everybody

00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,440
to figure it out with us but it was

00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,240
really awesome and i just appreciate

00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:12,160

00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:23,360
who've stepped up to

00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:25,199

00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,560
lot for all of us to make this community

00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:28,960

00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:32,240
such a broad and deep bench

00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:34,479
of support for the project

00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,080
so heather let's see what was your

00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:37,519
second favorite session

00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,519
at drupalcon this year because i know

00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:42,880
your first was that was the

00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:44,959
um a penguin core for sure always always

00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,680
can't help myself stem education gets me

00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:47,680
every time

00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,600
you know i i i don't know that i can

00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,120
pick a second favorite i

00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,720
i know we talked about the initiative

00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,200
keynotes but i thought that was such a

00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,880
cool way for those teams to get together

00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,120
and share not only what they're doing

00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:02,320
but how they're driving the project and

00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:04,240
um i don't know tim did you have one um

00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,760
i thought cherie's presentation was

00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,760
really really powerful and i'm looking

00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:10,480
