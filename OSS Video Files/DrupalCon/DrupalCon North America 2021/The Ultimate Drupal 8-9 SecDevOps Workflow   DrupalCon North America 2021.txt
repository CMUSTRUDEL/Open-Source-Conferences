	00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:05,839
all right i'm ready to go ahead and get

00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,280
started

00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:09,920
um so uh welcome to this uh lightning

00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,719
talk

00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:15,040
the ultimate drupal 8 versus 9 sec

00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:17,199
devops workflow so uh

00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,400
essentially a lot of the things we've

00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:21,760
been talking about

00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:23,840
at black mesh is related to security and

00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:27,119
you'll see some of that today

00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:30,080
and uh with our workflow tool um

00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:31,199
a big area that we have been focusing on

00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,520
is creating

00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:34,960
the best sec devops workflow and i

00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,559
wouldn't definitely say we're there yet

00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:39,680
we're getting there

00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:42,480
right now we are just focused on

00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:44,079
gathering a lot of the requirements and

00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,360
our tool that we'll show a little bit of

00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:50,079
today

00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:51,840
we call it cascade has a flexible way to

00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:54,000
to do a lot of these steps in it and we

00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,760
are in active development adding

00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,559
additional

00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,680
features every day but i'll start by

00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:01,680
introducing myself

00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,920
and kelly uh i'm solomon gifford senior

00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:07,119
director of cms product development

00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:09,040
here at black mesh and kelly beck a 15

00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:10,400
year old drupal veteran

00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:13,200
doing development like i said for about

00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:17,439
15 years so

00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:19,439
our our emphasis today is on

00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:20,799
talking about what does it mean to have

00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:24,320
a great sec devops

00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:25,759
workflow and i'll start by saying that

00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,840
you know the devops and the agile

00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:31,360
methodology have really changed

00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:34,400
how we approach dev and and operations

00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:36,079
you know in the past 10 years and it's

00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,520
now really changing how we approach

00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:40,479
security as well

00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,759
and that's uh a big piece of what we

00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:44,960
want to talk about

00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:46,640
a quick look at black mesh again my

00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,880
focus is not to just push black mission

00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:52,240
but to really get to

00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:53,600
the content of of security in exec

00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,600
devops

00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,719
but just wanted to to kind of give a

00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,159
little bit of introduction of where

00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:00,399
we're coming from

00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:01,759
we specialize in managing complex cms

00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:05,280
websites securely

00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:08,319
at scale and that really does mean

00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,399
that uh that we're focused on on

00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:13,599
providing solutions around

00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:14,560
security and sect devops we have devops

00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:17,360
experts

00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:19,120
available we have a support team 24 7

00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,599
365.

00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,800
compliance and security is a big piece

00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:26,000
of what we do

00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,560
whether it's fedramp or hipaa or pci uh

00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,440
others

00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,040
uh we manage in our own data centers we

00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:33,360
manage on aws

00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:35,200
other customers may have infrastructure

00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,319
and we can manage that

00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,319
in other words we don't bring the

00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:39,280
infrastructure ourselves and we go

00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:41,360
beyond just

00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,680
drupal drupal's a big component of what

00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:46,800
we do it's a large part of our business

00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:49,680
but we also provide support for those

00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,280
platforms that need drupal plus whether

00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:54,560
it be

00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,760
so some windows boxes or containers or

00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:59,440
whatever else

00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:01,440
and i focused a second ago on

00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,959
the different ways that we deliver

00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:05,519
hosting

00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:07,040
it could be shared it could be hybrid um

00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,280
dedicated clouds

00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,159
uh we could do containers physicals even

00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,239
have a fact server

00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:13,760
or data center that a customer needs so

00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:15,760
a lot of different

00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,879
uh scenarios that that's not just

00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,400
hosting

00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:20,239
but it's also the services that are

00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,519
built on top of that

00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:26,159
we don't do development that is focused

00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:27,920
we leave that to our agency partners but

00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:29,840
when it comes to devops which

00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,680
is a new form of development yes we do

00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,879
that and so that's kind of the

00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:36,640
background

00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:38,799
of where we're coming from at black mesh

00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:41,280
and i mentioned the security standards

00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:44,159
so we are fedramp authorized

00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:46,879
our all of our clouds have some type of

00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:50,000
certification whether it's hipaa pci

00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:53,040
or fedramp and uh yes we can

00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,200
work with gdpr and ferpa

00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:57,040
and fisma and a bunch of the other

00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,360
acronyms i can drop all day

00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,040
but the point is is uh we were the first

00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,519
drupal hosting provider

00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:05,120
to focus on security and we've been

00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:07,760
doing this for a long time

00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,640
so that's a little bit of a background

00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,159
on

00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,319
on who we are and what we do as a

00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:14,560
company but i think what's more

00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:16,079
interesting is our workflow that we're

00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:19,280
working on cascade

00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:20,959
is our dev stage prod workflow tool

00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:22,320
uh has a bunch of quick starts for

00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:25,600
drupal and wordpress

00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:29,280
but at its core it allows

00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:30,560
us to have and pipelines like like

00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,840
jenkins and like some other tools that

00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,800
do ciacd

00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:36,320
it's really customizable and flexible so

00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:40,160
that kind of gives the

00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:43,919
the background of the backdrop for um

00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:47,280
our the way we approach um our our sec

00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:50,080
devops and uh when starting to

00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:51,600
approach sex devops i know it can feel a

00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:54,639
little bit challenging at first

00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:56,240
but uh the normal way that sective

00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:57,759
office has been or security has been

00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,479
approached in the past is really as

00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:01,840
a a step that is done at the very end of

00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:02,880
the process

00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,039
and one of the things that we're

00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,400
preaching is shift left that really

00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:08,800
means let's let's start talking about

00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:11,520
security much earlier in the process

00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,440
and that provides that feedback loop and

00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,960
the ability to start doing radiations

00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,639
much earlier in the process it also

00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,600
provides a shared responsibility and

00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:19,280
ownership

00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:22,320
among the whole team security is no

00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:24,560
longer that other team it's now our team

00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,240
if you feel overwhelmed start small and

00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,720
work on continue improvement

00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,680
um the ultimate workflow is not built in

00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,360
a day

00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,360
but one of the pieces that really helps

00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,479
with this process is automation

00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,680
so whether we'll talk about some

00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:37,120
scanning tools and some other things

00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,080
like that in a second but

00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:42,080
really focusing on being able to test

00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:44,880
scan and monitor early on the process is

00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:46,240
extremely important

00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,240
there's a couple pieces that are really

00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,440
important just to have as

00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,720
like a backdrop for the entire

00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,759
environment you have to have separation

00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,800
of duties

00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:57,280
and separation of data and attribution

00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:59,440
we're talking about logging so

00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,880
the separation of duty is is least

00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,560
privileged

00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,560
when we talk about data separation

00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,319
trying to keep your production data out

00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,080
of your development environment

00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:09,520
and attributing is really important for

00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,000
reconstruction of events you need to

00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,639
know

00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,479
who did what when where at all times and

00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:16,560
so that's extremely important

00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:18,160
kelly will talk about securing the

00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:21,840
supply chain which is extremely

00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,840
important as well

00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:27,199
kelly you're on mute

00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,440
solomon and thanks for the nice

00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:36,240
introduction

00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:38,160
as a veteran drupal developer developer

00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,919
my role has been to build end-to-end

00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,160
solutions which many times

00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:43,919
means bringing third-party modules or

00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,160
packages from a library

00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:47,199
but that introduces the risk of software

00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,880
supply chain

00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:51,120
attack vectors so when we think about

00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,240
sec devops in this context we have to

00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,120
think about

00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,080
securing the entire supply chain and it

00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,319
brings me to

00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,520
sort of a prime directive of security

00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:01,919
which is

00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:03,680
all changes regardless of their source

00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:05,759
must be reviewed before they are

00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,039
deployed into production as a deployment

00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,680
artifact

00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:12,000
and when we talk about changes like this

00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,680
so we're talking about

00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,400
your code meaning the code that you

00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:18,960
write and nowadays increasingly we use

00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:21,440
a thing which we like to call to or like

00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:23,440
to refer to as a thin repository

00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:25,520
um and you know we're only maintaining

00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:27,680
the code in these repositories

00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,880
that is yours to maintain and we bring

00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,680
all kinds of other code

00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:33,039
in via library packaging systems like

00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:36,639
composers

00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:40,240
or composer another one is npm it's yarn

00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:43,759
and we bring those changes in

00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:46,720
via via ci cd

00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:48,319
pipelines and things like that and those

00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,160
kind of changes brought in by packaging

00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:52,639
systems can include

00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,599
uh third-party libraries they can

00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:56,240
include

00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,960
dependency updates they can include

00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,240
upstream

00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:03,759
changes and

00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:06,240
all in all uh very many ci cd systems

00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:08,160
are not putting these changes in front

00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:11,280
of reviewers

00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:13,360
so one of the things that we want to do

00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:15,199
is make sure to capture changes brought

00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,080
in by composer capture changes brought

00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,000
in by yarn

00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:20,479
and be able to put them in front of a

00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:24,000
reviewer for security purposes

00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:25,520
um and all of these uh another place

00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,280
where you can bring changes in

00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:29,520
is you know through your standard manual

00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,160
packaging process either through drush

00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,880
or through

00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:34,240
you know grabbing tar balls uh directly

00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,399
from d.o

00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,000
but at the end of the day uh what your

00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:40,399
security team needs

00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,680
is the ability to review what is being

00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:43,680
deployed to live

00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:46,399
and for that reason one of our pro tips

00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:48,560
is take your thin repository

00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:49,600
and turn it into a thick repository and

00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,800
have your ci

00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:55,760
cd system do that for you

00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:57,440
also remember to secure that build

00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,920
environment and secure that

00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,959
the the ci cd pipeline environment

00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:03,360
itself

00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:04,240
as there are a lot of modern attack

00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,720
vectors out there

00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,320
solar winds comes to mind and others

00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,800
that will target

00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,600
ci cd systems and and these attack

00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,640
factors are

00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:16,240
often overlooked and thankfully you know

00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,880
with all this work we do

00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,800
have a lot of automation uh

00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:23,200
opportunities in our pipeline

00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:26,000
in our ci cd pipeline we can bring in to

00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,839
help scan for vulnerabilities

00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,600
all right so i'd like to hand it over to

00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:31,839
salomon for that one yeah and as a

00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,200
as a two-minute overview of what cascade

00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:36,320
does and how it works

00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:38,720
you can add new projects different types

00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:40,560
and then you can go to that project and

00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,240
you can deploy your code from dev to

00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:44,560
stage to production

00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,399
but underneath is a pipeline just like

00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,680
jenkins that allows you to edit those

00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:49,680
pipelines

00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:51,279
and then ultimately change the different

00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,640
tasks that are happening and you can

00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:54,959
change the order

00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:56,480
you can add additional text or actions

00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:57,519
we call them whether it's a search and

00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,880
replace

00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:01,839
or whether it's a a script or changing a

00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:04,959
service

00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:06,720
and this is all built on top of ansible

00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:08,399
ansible allowing us to be ultimately

00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,480
flexible so

00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,959
i'll uh i'll stop there i'll be happy to

00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:15,120
give anybody a demo a full demo of the

00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:16,640
uh of the application later but the

00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,000
point is is that we're thinking about

00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:21,440
security and

00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:24,079
our ci cd tool works with security

00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:26,000
and compliance and um we definitely are

00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:29,120
interested in having a conversation

00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,440
with anybody about uh cascade or about

00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:33,600
security and thick within repos

00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,480
and creating that ultimate devops

00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,600
workflow

00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,800
let us know if you have any questions

00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,800
we'll stick around for a few minutes

00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:47,839
here

00:10:53,120 --> 00:11:01,839
i will get that link to you right here

00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,800
start there

00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:17,279
we are currently building out out this

00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,399
is a six year project we're currently

00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:21,440
building out

00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:23,839
a full public facing documentation for

00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,360
for uh for people but uh give me a

00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:29,839
second i'll

00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,839
provide another link as well

00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,120
for code scanning i had another slide

00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,680
that i was going to present but i ran

00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:42,320
out of time but essentially

00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,880
there's three different types of

00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,000
scanning

00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:47,680
sas desks and i asked and

00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,200
it just depends on where they are in the

00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:51,600
process

00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,880
most of our customers bring a tool to us

00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,839
and then we implement it into the

00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,680
pipeline

00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:57,040
but we would be happy to help evaluate

00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:00,880
some of those

00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:00,880
as well for customers um

00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:04,880
that's a quick quick answer hopefully

00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:11,839
for the uh for the code scanning

00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:11,839
question for you scott

00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:20,480
question from chris are we building our

00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:23,600
own packages clones

00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:27,360
uh no we don't um instead

00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:28,399
our model is to make sure that that you

00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,160
are reviewing

00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:31,519
that in your pipeline you get to review

00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:33,680
those um

00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:35,040
obviously as a as a cut as a company

00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,560
that provides services

00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,720
we'd be happy to do that at a price

00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:40,880
point but that's

00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:53,839
not part of a core offering that's just

00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:53,839
available to all customers

00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:08,880
i share a link to the slides i would be

00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:08,880
happy to share a link to the slides

00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:21,360
oh i love the question on lando d dev

00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:24,320
and doxo and other local dev

00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,839
uh the answer is yes in a number of

00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:28,880
forms

00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:31,600
we are working on a official integration

00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:33,680
um with we're in talks i should say with

00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,680
tandem to build an official

00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,800
uh integration with lando however we do

00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:40,160
have a relationship

00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:43,360
with the lando team with tandem and

00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:45,120
we can provide lando files

00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:47,199
that work with our infrastructure so

00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:50,720
there is a unofficial if you will

00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:54,399
integration there um as for ddev

00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:57,440
um and doc's old no

00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:58,800
however um because we provided git

00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,639
repository

00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,240
as part of cascade we actually installed

00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:05,440
git lab as part of that

00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:06,880
we find that most of those environments

00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:17,839
do work

00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:17,839
pretty seamlessly with with us

00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:27,600
i think if i understand that question

00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,920
from evans

00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,800
we provide a lando file and cascade

00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:33,600
comes with a git

00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:35,199
implementation gitlab implementation

00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:39,600
obviously gitlab is the

00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:42,399
preferred drupal git repository software

00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:44,560
and with that it creates a pretty

00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:46,639
seamless process where you're doing

00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:48,959
local development in lando

00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:49,920
and when you push your code to your

00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:51,839
gitlab instance

00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:54,079
it automatically gets checked out into

00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:55,839
dev with cascade and then

00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:59,199
within the cascade interface you can

00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:59,199
push from dev to stage to pride

00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:13,839
great questions anybody else

00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:27,839
so

00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,639
we absolutely support that workflow

00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:57,360
admins

00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:59,120
of branching and uh pulling working

00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,480
pushing back testing merging um

00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,240
absolutely

00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:04,079
again that's a lot of that's basic get

00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:05,759
functionality and obviously git lab is

00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:08,720
associated with

00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:09,680
um is installed with cascade within

00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,639
cascade

00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:13,920
and i can show a little picture of this

00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:17,600
um

00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:20,839
but so for example uh you can assign

00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:22,240
different environments to different

00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:23,519
branches

00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:26,720
and obviously this doesn't have to be

00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:29,839
master this could be you know my branch

00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:31,440
but when you make those changes

00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:32,880
then i'm not going to make that change

00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,240
since that doesn't exist but when you

00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,079
make those changes

00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:38,000
when you do a deploy whether it be an

00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:38,560
automated deploy because you committed

00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,399
to that

00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:43,759
branch or otherwise it will

00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:45,920
automatically deploy to that environment

00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:47,839
you could do promote to actually move it

00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:49,279
between environments

00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:51,759
so the answer is yes and by the way i

00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:54,800
can show you um

00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:58,160
that a full git lab

00:16:54,800 --> 00:17:01,360
is included as part of

00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:02,800
cascade here and so we tightly

00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:05,839
integrated with

00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,839
with git lab

00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:19,839
any other questions

00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:41,600
yemen's and anyone else definitely feel

00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:44,320
free to uh reach out on

00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:46,400
on drupal slack or send me an email

00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,760
definitely would love to continue the

00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,280
conversation i'll stick around here for

00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:52,080
a little longer but i'm just saying if

00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:53,679
anybody wants to get a personalized demo

00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:57,120
of cascada would be more than happy to

00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:59,760
talk about that and set devops and

00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:03,919
we're definitely very interested in

00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:03,919
