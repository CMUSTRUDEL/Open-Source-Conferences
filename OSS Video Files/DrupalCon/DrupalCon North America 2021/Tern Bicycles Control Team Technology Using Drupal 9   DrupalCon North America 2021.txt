me in taipei

00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:38,800
and so that's a little bit too late a

00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:41,120
little bit too early for me to stay up

00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,720
and that is why i'm unable to attend

00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,560

i'm currently the brand director at term

00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:50,640
bicycles which is a brand that designs

00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:51,280
and manufactures electric and folding

00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,239
bikes

00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:56,080
for everyday use we have people all over

00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:59,280
the world that use their bikes to

00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:01,920
commute to work to go grocery shopping

00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,959
to take their children to school and i

00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,280
personally take

00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:06,800
my son every weekend to soccer practice

00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,280
with our bikes

00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,560
we pride ourselves in designing bikes

00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,920
and accessories

00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,440
that'll help people drive less and cycle

00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,599
more

00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,040
i'm very excited to have michael share

00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:22,800
with everyone here

00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:25,040
how tag one helped us keep and maintain

00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,159
a fully and highly functional website

00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:29,040
with drupal 6

00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:30,000
for about 10 years and with their

00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:33,920
assistance

00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:37,040
how we were able to finally upgrade and

00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,599
migrate our site to drupal 9. thank you

00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,680
very much

00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:42,239
and i will turn this presentation over

00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,239
to michael

00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,000
all right so we're going to cover a lot

00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:49,120
here we're going to start with an intro

00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,560
to turn why they first adopted drupal 10

00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,799
years ago

00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,560
how they navigated drupal 6 going end of

00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:57,200
life which is a topic that a lot of

00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,000
drupal 7 users are wrestling with right

00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,120
now

00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,200
we're going to go over the business

00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,360
goals for the project why they decided

00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,920
to continue using drupal and migrate to

00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,120
nine

00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,560
we're gonna show off a little bit of the

00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,360
site and i urge you to check it out

00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,799
yourself

00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,640
uh as well some of the really cool

00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,000
technical solutions that we built to

00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,280
meet those goals

00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
we'll touch on our approach to

00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:18,959
migrations and how we manage working

00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,639
a world apart uh i encourage you to put

00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,160
your questions in the chat we'll save

00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,160
some time at the end

00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,160
and if we run out of time i'll hang out

00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:30,639
at the tag one booth for a while

00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:31,759
as well so here's terry to tell you a

00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:34,000
little bit more about

00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:34,000
turn

00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
as i mentioned in my intro slide turn is

00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,479
committed to building

00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,440
a more sustainable future by designing

00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:46,400
bicycles

00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:47,040
that help change the way people move get

00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,080
around

00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,720
cities and in their daily lives we were

00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,600
founded

00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,960
in 2011 and turn is headquartered here

00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:58,320
in taipei taiwan

00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:02,160
and we have branch offices in finland

00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:05,440
us the uk and in china and we have about

00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,240
78 team members worldwide our product

00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:09,600
portfolio

00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,400
includes cargo bikes electric cargo

00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,600
bikes

00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:16,639
holding bikes electric folding bikes and

00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,440
stylish street bikes our bikes are

00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:20,960
distributed

00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:23,840
in over 45 countries around the world

00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,560
and we work with over 35 different

00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:27,280
distributors

00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:29,039
that represents these countries because

00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:31,680
each distributor

00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:32,639
purchases a unique product portfolio

00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,400
whether it be

00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,960
an accessory that they want to sell in

00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:39,759
their countries or maybe a bike model

00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:41,280
with a certain color or spec

00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:44,560
configuration

00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:46,400
we needed to have a website that allowed

00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,160
them to showcase their individual

00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,560
plumbing

00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,800
we also needed to have a website that

00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,759
allowed our distributors to translate

00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,000
pages

00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:57,840
and to control and maintain their

00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,120
individual country website

00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:07,840
without interfering or messing up

00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:07,840
another country's website

00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,440
so let's talk about why turn first chose

00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,720
drupal

00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:19,199
10 years ago turn bicycles was founded

00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:21,120
in 2011 as a new brand and they needed a

00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,880
site really fast

00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,240
the team had used drupal in the past and

00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,240
so they were confident that it would

00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:29,120
meet both their immediate needs

00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,160
as well as their long-term need and

00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,400
while drupal

00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:34,319
has a steeper initial learning curve its

00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:37,199
overall capabilities were really

00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:39,039
well worth that upfront investment no

00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:41,680
platform could match drupal's

00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:43,199
low code capabilities um you know the

00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,720
site building features that include

00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,319
things like the ability to create a

00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:49,280
content bicycle type

00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:51,199
uh and the fields associated with that

00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,560
creating a page listing bicycles

00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,960
being able to translate all those

00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,479
bicycles and do all that by pointing and

00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:59,680
clicking with no code and no

00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:01,440
dependencies or developers required

00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,280
the most difficult decision for turn

00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,599
actually wasn't should they use drupal

00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,400
but

00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:08,160
what version of drupal should they use

00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,960
if you remember drupal 7 was scheduled

00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,360
to go live

00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,880
later in the year in 2011 but

00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,599
unfortunately some of the key modules

00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:18,160
wouldn't be ready for about another year

00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:20,479
so ultimately turn decided to use drupal

00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,919
6 so that they could launch quickly

00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:24,160
and with confidence that it was going to

00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:25,840
be a really stable platform with all the

00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,360
features and functionality that they

00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,919
needed

00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,120
they rarely needed developers to update

00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:32,960
or manage the site

00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,400
after launch it's pretty amazing what

00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,919
they've done drupal's

00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,680
site building capabilities really

00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:39,840
delivered what they needed

00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:43,360
and their business and marketing teams

00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:46,639
were in complete control

00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,759
about five years later though in 2016 d6

00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:49,919
reached end of life

00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:51,280
and you know users of drupal 7 are going

00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:52,720
through this right now

00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:55,280
trying to figure out you know what do

00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:57,599
you do after your platform goes

00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:59,840
end of life and is no longer supported

00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:03,199
by the community

00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:05,360
well turns d6 site was

00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:06,879
exceeding expectations so from a

00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,560
business standpoint and from a

00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:10,720
functionality standpoint

00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,240
they didn't really need or want to

00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,479
migrate and

00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,879
migrations are really time consuming and

00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:18,639
expensive so from a company standpoint

00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:20,160
there was way better you know places

00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:21,680
that they could invest that money at

00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,199
that time to grow the business you know

00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,560
they weren't looking to invest in their

00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:26,800
website

00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,720
but even if they wanted to migrate the

00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:31,440
key modules weren't mature enough

00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:33,039
um and didn't exist yet and so it would

00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,880
have been really expensive to migrate

00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:37,200
compared to waiting so there was a big

00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:39,760
incentive to wait for them

00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,839
um and you know a big reason for turn

00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,440
adopting drupal was you know freedom

00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:44,800
from being held hostage by

00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,360
technology right you know the

00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:48,240
independence of uh you know reliance on

00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,200
developers

00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,480
business people being in control um and

00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,600
you know they didn't want to be

00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:57,600
forced to you know upgrade and

00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:00,240
with drupal's extended support that's

00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:03,920
just what they were able to achieve

00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:06,480
and so tag one's

00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:08,080
extended support enabled turn to

00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:11,600
securely run and manage their

00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:14,399
d6 site for another five years after

00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,760
eol a 10-year return on investment which

00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:17,839
is just astounding

00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:19,360
so if you're running drupal 7 please

00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:21,519
know that you can extend

00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,040
and run seven for at least another 7

00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:25,600
years if you want to

00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:27,279
using the drupal 7 extended support

00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,560
program and that you can make a business

00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:31,600
decision to upgrade

00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,399
when you need to speaking of business

00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,200
decisions

00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:36,640
let's talk about what turn wanted to do

00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,760
with their new website you know what

00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:41,760
were their goals for upgrading

00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,279
all their stats had been growing since

00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,040
inception and there were some really

00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:48,160
noticeable jumps

00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:50,080
in 2017 traffic increased around 30

00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,839
percent when they launched their gsd

00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,279
electric cargo bike which was hugely

00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:54,800
successful

00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:56,720
and with increased interest in cycling

00:09:54,800 --> 00:10:01,040
during the pandemic monthly unique users

00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:03,279
went up 130 percent this time last year

00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,480
very interesting is that turns traffic

00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:06,079
is highly global

00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:08,000
really distributed as you can see here

00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:10,640
in this chart and they're seeing

00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,320
explosive growth over 240 percent

00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,760
in many of their markets and regions

00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,680
around the world

00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:18,240
they've long been wanting to you know do

00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:20,240
a major revamp of their website and

00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,600
with less travel and events going on

00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,600
during the pandemic

00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,360
turn had an opportunity to focus

00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,000
marketing budget on their ever

00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,959
increasing

00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,880
popular online presence and do their

00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:33,600
project

00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:35,279
so some of the key reasons for upgrading

00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,160
drupal and what they wanted in a new

00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:37,920
site

00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,760
they wanted a faster site they wanted to

00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,680
provide even more relevant information

00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,079
to users and they wanted the site to be

00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:45,279
even

00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:46,000
easier to use for consumers uh

00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:47,440
distributors

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,800
you know that's how they get their bikes

00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,519
out there through distributors and then

00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,839
dealers

00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:53,920
so distributors was a top priority for

00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:56,480
them and turn wanted to be able to

00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:58,480
enable them to do more like making

00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:00,640
translations and managing content and

00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,240
the site so much easier

00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,480
of course there were tons of feature

00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,079
requests and feature enhancements

00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,920
uh site building you know which had made

00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:09,519
the company so successful

00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,360
you know it had to be even easier for

00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:12,240
non-technical people to update the site

00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,000
in the future

00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,279
they wanted even more control than they

00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,440
could previously

00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:19,440
and again post launch you know they

00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:21,839
didn't think or want developers

00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,360
to be needed for managing the day-to-day

00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:24,160
of the site and they don't have to have

00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,079
that you know

00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:29,040
they only want developers to come in for

00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:30,800
enhancements and adding functionality

00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,399
a big part of this is limiting

00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,480
proprietary code

00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:36,079
so it's really important to turn in this

00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,240
project that we either

00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:40,800
use drupal's built-in capabilities or

00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,800
enhanced drupal's built-in capabilities

00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:45,360
so that they weren't saddled with a lot

00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:48,480
of proprietary code

00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:50,480
and lastly um turn didn't just lead this

00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,399
project but they were heavily engaged in

00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,480
participating in it and so

00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:56,480
you know a big part of it was for them

00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:59,040
to learn the technology and make sure

00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,639
that they could own and control this

00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:02,959
independently and achieve all their

00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:05,040
goals so

00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:06,959
turn considered all their options when

00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:09,600
they were doing their upgrade

00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:10,320
process and they chose to rebuild on

00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,839
drupal

00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:14,800
so why did they stick with drupal they

00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:17,839
could have gone to any other platform

00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:19,920
from a development standpoint d9 is an

00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:20,320
entirely different platform than d6 and

00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,000
seven

00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:24,000
and so given this you know it behooves

00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,959
companies to do that kind of

00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,839
in-depth analysis but ultimately they

00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:30,240
chose

00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:32,000
drupal for many of the reasons that they

00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,600
originally chose drupal

00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,920
you know all of that no code and low

00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,120
code functionality had really matured

00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:40,240
and improved

00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:42,079
beyond what they had originally you know

00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,000
new tools like layout builder

00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:45,839
would give them even more control and

00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,880
their distributors more control over the

00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:49,760
layout of pages

00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:51,279
and the content uh with over 45

00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:53,560
international websites

00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:55,519
there have been massive improvements in

00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:57,760
internationalization and translation

00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:59,279
workflows

00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,639
from an end you know from a user

00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,519
standpoint internally with their

00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:03,040
distributors

00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:05,120
while the underlying technology was

00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:06,079
different a lot of the terminology and

00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,399
concepts were the

00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:10,320
same which made it uh easier for the

00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:14,480
people actually using the site

00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:15,600
to migrate um and you know not having to

00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:18,000
you know deal with what they did in the

00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,760
past they were on drupal 6 for 10 years

00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
one of the really exciting things about

00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,880
nine is that the seamless upgrade path

00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,959
from nine to ten

00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:26,639
ten to eleven so they expect to get

00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:27,600
another decade out of drupal with this

00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,839
investment

00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:32,720
uh with seamless upgrades getting more

00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:35,200
and more functionality over time

00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,880
and lastly uh and and i think this is

00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,720
really important for organizations

00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,720
we had worked together for a long time

00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,720
turn had confidence and a partner

00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:45,120
that could deliver you know an upgrade

00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,399
is time consuming and expensive

00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,839
and it's important for you to know that

00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:50,320
you have a technology partner that's

00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:52,880
going to deliver

00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:54,320
give you a sneak peek of the new site i

00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:56,480
really suggest you check it out because

00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:58,800
we don't have a lot of time

00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,839
the new site is designed by terry and

00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,839
it's beautiful

00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,760
it's rich with this imagery that puts

00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:06,079
the focus on the products

00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,760
and the culture of turn and the people

00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:09,199
who ride their bikes

00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,800
when you first hit the site you'll see

00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:14,000
in the upper right hand corner

00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:16,240
you're directed to your country

00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,480
in the default language for that country

00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:20,480
and the site is broken down into

00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,680
six main sections with a lot within it

00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:24,480
i'm just going to touch on the bike

00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:27,519
section real quick to give you a taste

00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:29,440
bike section shows off uh all of turns

00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:31,360
platforms different you know bikes like

00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:33,600
the gsd system

00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,959
and all the individual bike models

00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,120
within that platform

00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:38,880
there's this great filter where you can

00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,480
find the bike that best matches your

00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,920
interest like i'm looking for a commuter

00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,760
bike with a seat

00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,920
for someone to sit on in the back and

00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:47,680
then there's this new comparison feature

00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:49,440
which lets you check out the bikes and

00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,720
then you can dig into a bicycle and

00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,880
learn everything about

00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,000
its accessories and you know its

00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:57,120
technology

00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,639
and get reviews and other information so

00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:01,040
uh please you know check out the new

00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:03,600
site it's really beautiful

00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:05,360
um and you know here's where things get

00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:08,560
complicated with the new site

00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:10,240
um and that's you know the 45

00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:12,000
plus multilingual websites that are

00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,440
going on you know that that you're

00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,440
not necessarily seeing and i'm trying to

00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:17,360
show these off in the different slides

00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:19,199
that we have here the photos

00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:21,199
as terry mentioned each distributor

00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:22,560
exclusively owns one or more country

00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:24,720
specific sites

00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:26,560
and it's up to them what bicycles they

00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,240
offer what configurations of those

00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:30,560
bicycles they offer

00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,480
in any particular country in addition to

00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:34,079
all that configuration they can add

00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:37,120
pages remove pages

00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:40,720
change layouts and turn has control over

00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:43,839
everything that they can or can't do

00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:44,959
um and you know if you're uh you know

00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:47,120
dealing with a a

00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:48,560
a country like canada for example that

00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,920
has french and english you know most

00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:52,160
countries have at least

00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,959
you know two languages that's a lot to

00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,399
manage so

00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:56,079
you know even a distributor that just

00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:57,040
has one country like canada with two

00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:59,120
languages

00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:01,360
they're juggling a lot of content and if

00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:03,440
you have multiple countries or your turn

00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,560
managing all of these distributors

00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,839
that's a lot to deal with and we're

00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,800
going to show off some cool tools that

00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:10,000
we built to

00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:12,160
to manage that so here are some really

00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:15,279
cool solutions that we built to meet

00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:17,440
turns goals all of them are open source

00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:20,000
that you can benefit from these two

00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:22,079
with your websites i'm sure you guys are

00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,519
all familiar with layout builder

00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:25,199
you know gives you the ability to have

00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:25,920
tremendous control over what's on the

00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:29,120
page

00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:31,120
i'm logged in here and i'm going to show

00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:33,600
you how to edit the bike page just by

00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:35,600
clicking layout

00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,279
you know let's say a new accessory

00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,399
launch and i want to feature it at the

00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:41,120
top of the page

00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:42,320
well i can easily add a new block add

00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,240
photos or videos

00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:46,000
and just as easily move content around

00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:48,639
the page or remove content

00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,560
and again no code no deployments very

00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:54,079
easy to update your site

00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:56,240
but while layout is really impressive

00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:57,680
it offers very little control over the

00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,120
theme or the style

00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,639
and turn sight is beautiful you know

00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,839
that's really important to them and a

00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:03,680
lot of organizations

00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:05,679
and you know there are ways to get

00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:08,240
around this like embedding html

00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:09,760
and css directly into your content and

00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:11,199
while that's a nice hack

00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:13,199
it's a really bad practice to be

00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:15,360
hard-coding things all over the place

00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:17,600
and so in this project what we did is we

00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:18,400
extended layout builders capabilities to

00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:21,280
address

00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:23,039
this feature gap we added components to

00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:26,240
drupal which is a concept that's really

00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:28,640
popular in other frameworks like laravel

00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:30,480
a component can be anything on a page so

00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,600
in this simple example underneath quarry

00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,280
basket there

00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:36,000
you have a really simple component that

00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:40,000
we call tagline

00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:43,360
now using our new system you can control

00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,039
its css and styles via configuration

00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:47,200
again in this basic example you can

00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:48,240
change the classes of what this tagline

00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:51,280
is going to look like

00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,400
on various different devices and this

00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,000
functionality is going to be open

00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,520
sourced in the near future so that you

00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,919
can use it too

00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:59,120
it gives you a lot of control over the

00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:01,120
look and feel of your site

00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:03,360
but it doesn't yet go that last little

00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:05,200
bit and give you complete control

00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:07,039
you can't edit the classes without

00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,600
editing code but i'm going to come back

00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:09,039
to it

00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,160
and come back to this in a minute and

00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:11,200
show you how we're going to make that

00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:14,320
happen

00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:15,600
but first remember that country selector

00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:17,520
up in the right hand corner

00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:19,760
well that's a component too and the

00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,160
really cool thing is that components can

00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:22,960
have

00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:24,559
actions that you can control so this

00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,559
component on action

00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:28,080
so it has an on click action that shows

00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:30,320
you a drop down

00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:32,480
of all of the country language options

00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:34,400
that you can choose from

00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,760
and so for another client project that

00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,919
we're working on currently

00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:39,919
we're extending this layout capability

00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:42,240
that we built to give site builders that

00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:44,960
complete control that everybody wants

00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:46,160
the ability to add or edit new styles or

00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:49,120
create and modify

00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:50,000
actions as configuration with no code

00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:52,559
updates

00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,480
it's really low code and super intuitive

00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:57,280
you don't even need to know css to make

00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:59,840
simple changes we also use the

00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:00,400
alpine js framework to make adding and

00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,480
editing

00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:04,240
actions super simple so you don't need

00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,919
to be a javascript developer to make

00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:08,960
really cool things happen

00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:11,679
again all via configuration simple

00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:15,120
example here i remove the word uppercase

00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:17,440
and change the text from gray to black

00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:19,440
um there is a real time preview so you

00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:21,520
can see exactly what's happening and

00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:23,440
what it's going to look like

00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:25,200
and you know the really cool thing here

00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,559
is that this is going to be open source

00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,640
the near future when we're

00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:29,760
uh further along in this other client

00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,679
project and

00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:33,600
we do this for a lot of our clients and

00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:35,039
projects it has a huge impact for

00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:38,080
everybody that we work with

00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:40,559
as well as users of drupal so you can

00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:42,240
benefit from this as well

00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:45,039
there's a great talk coming up later in

00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:46,720
drupalcon on components on thursday with

00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:48,080
peta and fabian

00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:50,480
please check it out if you want to learn

00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,960
more about it you can also learn more

00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,280
about

00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,720
components in our tag one team talks our

00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:56,480
podcast and vlog

00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,679
we cover a bunch of other exciting

00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,280
things like adding real-time

00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:01,120
collaboration to drupal

00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,720
and performance and scalability and load

00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:06,240
testing with our open source

00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:09,360
goose framework so please dig in

00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,240
um i talked earlier about managing

00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:12,159
translations

00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:14,159
across so many different websites and

00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:16,240
how time consuming that can be

00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:18,400
if you want to update content and so we

00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:21,679
added the ability to granularly

00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:23,520
bulk copy translations across websites

00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:24,720
now this is really similar to how views

00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,400
bulk edit works

00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:28,159
you know you select the content in the

00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:30,640
languages that you want to update

00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:32,720
and you hit synchronize you can sort and

00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:34,159
filter to get at just the content that

00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,520
you want

00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:37,919
and then you pick the language that you

00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:38,799
want to copy from and you can choose the

00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:40,640
individual

00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:43,200
fields that you want to sync so you can

00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,600
take you know a spanish translation that

00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,240
you

00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:48,320
you know mastered and you know copied

00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:50,720
across uruguay and paraguay

00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:52,000
and then update it for individual local

00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:54,480
changes so you're doing

00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,679
really much less work in individual

00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:58,000
countries

00:20:55,679 --> 00:21:00,320
um again you know minimize proprietary

00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,320
code improve drupal as a platform

00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:04,320
so this was open source as well you can

00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:06,480
use this today

00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,679
um you know and for the same reason that

00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,440
we've been talking about

00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:11,360
um you know not wanting to be held

00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:13,520
hostage by technology easy

00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:15,679
upgrade pass turn really wanted to

00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,880
minimize their technical debt as part of

00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:18,559
this project so that's something we

00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,960
really carefully managed

00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:22,640
a small time investment up front to make

00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,280
some simple changes that made the site

00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,679
more

00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:26,799
d10 compatible is going to reduce their

00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:28,880
future effort

00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:30,000
you know turn isn't as reliant on

00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,799
developers down the

00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,320
line and before you know it d10 is going

00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:34,720
to be here we're talking almost a year

00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,440
away

00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:39,360
it's amazing how time flies so as a

00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,919
result their d10 upgrade process is

00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:42,880
going to be

00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:45,200
really easy we patched over 60

00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:48,159
contributed modules in the process

00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:50,480
so making them more d10 ready which

00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:52,400
helps everyone in the community

00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:54,000
ultimately there were only six issues

00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,200
that we couldn't address because they

00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,240
just couldn't yet be

00:21:55,200 --> 00:22:00,320
deprecated in d9 but we have a list and

00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:02,480
we're managing to our technical debt

00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:06,480
and we know exactly what we need to do

00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:06,480
when we come back to this in the future

00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:12,240
example um core jquery's library is

00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,960
going to be removed and deprecated in

00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,200
d10

00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:17,679
so we just switched out you know uh that

00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,799
mod that code for the core js cookie

00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:21,360
library so any

00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:22,000
modules using the you know the jquery

00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:25,120
cookie

00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:28,799
we just changed them over to the js core

00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:31,440
cookie very simple let's talk about

00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:32,720
uh data migrations uh i think you know

00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:35,679
anyone who's done

00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,320
a large platform upgrade or migration

00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:38,720
project

00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:41,039
knows that the actual data migration

00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:43,760
itself is one of the most time consuming

00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:45,120
and challenging aspects of a project so

00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,640
i really want to touch on some cool

00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:48,320
things that we did in our approach to

00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:50,720
migrations

00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:53,200
we always have migration resources

00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,559
working in parallel they start early

00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,159
and they want to have a clear sense of

00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:58,080
what needs to get done and make sure

00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:59,919
that they have the time to do it

00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:02,559
in this case migration was led and owned

00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:04,799
by a single developer working part-time

00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:06,400
with other developers helping out along

00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:08,400
the way

00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:10,080
we split things up so that it we had

00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,520
really granular control

00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,919
so for example when you're doing a

00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:16,640
migration run you could include or

00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:19,760
exclude very specific data sets and only

00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:20,799
process what you needed

00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:22,960
another really cool thing is the

00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:25,679
migration system could support

00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:28,640
multiple sources of course the main

00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:30,559
source was their existing d6 site but

00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:32,640
we also enabled them to work in

00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:34,080
spreadsheets which made it significantly

00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,520
more efficient to handle the large

00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,000
amount of data that they had and the

00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,799
changes

00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,559
in importing new data and we set up a

00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:40,960
more stable version of our development

00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:42,720
site

00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:44,799
and so this enabled them to work

00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:47,039
manually in the new system

00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:47,840
independent of the constant change going

00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:50,000
on in

00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:52,320
the in the background and so the

00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,720
migration system could pull from any or

00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:55,760
all of these systems in any given run

00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,080
and then insert

00:23:55,760 --> 00:24:00,080
into any environment and it also

00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:01,919
supported exception handling

00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:04,880
which i'll come back to and explain in

00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:08,480
more detail in a minute

00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:10,960
so handling data migrations has

00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:12,159
a lot of challenges just to give you an

00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:14,000
example

00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:16,240
the sheer amount of data over half a

00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,120
million record sets built up over 10

00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,960
years

00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:20,559
with data formatting and other changes

00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:22,320
in that data leading to a lot of

00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:24,080
variability we needed to detect and

00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:25,520
count for

00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:27,840
all the new functionality and just

00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:29,840
changing from six to nine while 80

00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:32,000
of the entities were able to map

00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:35,520
one-to-one for the most part the

00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:38,720
remainder needed considerable remapping

00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:40,400
permissions critically important

00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:42,320
you know when you introduce new features

00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:45,039
and functionality like groups

00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:46,240
that change access control you really

00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:48,720
need to be meticulous

00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:50,320
in your conversion and your testing to

00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:52,240
make sure you don't give people access

00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:55,279
to things that they shouldn't have

00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:55,760
um multilingual changed a lot from six

00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:58,000
to nine

00:24:55,760 --> 00:25:00,159
in six every node and every translated

00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,240
node had its own nid

00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:04,159
but in nine there's only one id for all

00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:07,679
of a node's translations and with

00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:09,360
over 45 uh multilingual sites and

00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:11,840
multiple languages can you know per

00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:14,960
country that was a lot to kind of pull

00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:17,120
together and manage and another big

00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:19,200
thing was data validation

00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:21,600
we created migrate plugins to do

00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:24,799
validation for different things

00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:26,400
for instance we check dealer addresses

00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:28,640
you know every country has hundreds of

00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:30,080
dealers thousands of dealers

00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:32,080
and you know we wanted to make sure that

00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:33,919
their state and country code for example

00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:36,400
was perfectly mapped to

00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:38,480
iso standards kind of clean up that data

00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,039
and any exceptions that were detected

00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:41,200
were then

00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:42,720
exported via spreadsheet so that churn

00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:44,720
could manually review

00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:46,720
fix them and then re-import just that

00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:47,279
data back through that spreadsheet

00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,440
system

00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:50,880
so really powerful what it enabled them

00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:52,400
to do

00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,080
another challenge in you know that

00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:56,480
variability of data and how things

00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:59,520
change is that in the d6 site

00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:01,120
a lot of data was in a single string

00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:03,360
you know so all of the bike

00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:04,880
specifications in certain cases

00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:07,679
you know we're just stored as a lot of

00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:08,880
text so for example you know the data

00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:11,360
about the distance from

00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:12,480
the seat post to the handlebar all that

00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:15,360
information is one

00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:17,120
field so we had a lot of write a lot of

00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:18,240
write a lot of regular expressions to

00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:21,360
split up that info

00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:22,080
into individual values so that we can

00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,799
support

00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:26,159
things like enhanced search metric

00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:29,520
conversions that really cool

00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:30,880
bike filter that we showed off the last

00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:32,320
thing that i want to touch on real quick

00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:34,799
i know we're running out of time

00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:35,440
is uh you know another big challenge and

00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:38,480
that was

00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:41,919
working a world apart um

00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:43,279
there was a 15-hour spread between a lot

00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:45,200
of the resources

00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:47,279
which really limited our overlapping

00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:49,039
hours so we relied heavily on

00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:51,360
collaboration tools

00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:53,440
to try and get things done we did as

00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:55,840
much as possible asynchronously

00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:57,760
using things like uh recorded sprint

00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:59,120
demos that could later be viewed at a

00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:01,279
better time for you

00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:02,799
and stand-ups done asynchronously in

00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:04,960
slack

00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:06,880
really critical was planning you know we

00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:08,720
tried to identify things in advance that

00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:10,720
would require a lot of time

00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:12,320
and get started on them early or a lot

00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,600
extra time so we didn't run into

00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:16,960
blockers or

00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:17,360
large schedule slips um you know but a

00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,679
big

00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:21,600
goal for us was to work together as one

00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:23,919
team collaboratively make sure that

00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,880
churn can own that technology and so

00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:26,480
ultimately

00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:28,080
everyone had to go out of their way to

00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,880
accommodate each other so we're talking

00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:32,559
about a lot of

00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:34,720
6 a.m and 10 p.m meetings on weekends

00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:36,080
you know for months to get this done and

00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,440
so ultimately

00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:40,320
this project wouldn't have been

00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:42,559
successful without the team's dedication

00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:44,720
terry is just inspiring and insanely

00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:46,799
prolific in what she gets done

00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:48,080
she and her team are are really amazing

00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:51,360
and i want to thank them for the

00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:53,919
opportunity to work together on such

00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:56,000
an awesome project and i want to thank

00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:57,760
the tag one team for all their help in

00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,760
getting us here

00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:01,039
and thank you guys for joining us for

00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,720
the presentation

00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:04,399
uh we should have a few minutes left for

00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:06,080
q a and uh

00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:08,000
we'll we'll do that via chat and if we

00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:08,960
run out of time we can hop over to the

00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,480
tag one booth

00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:12,480
so that others can use the room

00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:20,399
awesome cool um

00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,880
so there is a tab for q a that is pretty

00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:24,960
cool

00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:28,559
any idea how do i read these things um

00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:30,559
they're grayed out select questions here

00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:33,440
we go any idea where we might see

00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:35,039
updates on these open source components

00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:37,440
coming from richard allen

00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:38,720
yeah richard check out our our blog

00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:40,880
we'll announce them

00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,840
and make sure that you can find them

00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,120
definitely

00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:45,600
and fabian i'm sure is going to talk

00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:47,520
more about that in his presentation

00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:49,279
i know that um some of the work we're

00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:52,080
doing on that other client project

00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:52,720
is months away uh it's a really big

00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:55,120
project

00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:56,559
and um we're in the early phases so it's

00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,760
gonna it's gonna trickle but there are

00:28:56,559 --> 00:29:00,399
definitely some things that are coming

00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:03,919
sooner rather than later

00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:05,120
another individual said any ideas where

00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:08,960
you might see the updates

00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:09,760
yep same thing 45 plus multilingual

00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,440
sites

00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:13,200
using a setup something like domain

00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:16,399
module okay so john yeah

00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:17,440
um in the past it used domain access and

00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:19,600
d6

00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,559
the new site was actually handled via

00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:24,640
translation

00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:28,000
so each individual country language com

00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:30,960
combination is a translation uh

00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,640
like uruguay spanish or you know canada

we will take the rest of your questions

00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:26,720
there wait i do see uh you mentioned

00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:29,200
regex for migration did you still find a

00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:31,200
lot of manual cleanup from timothy

00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:32,799
um yeah timmy we definitely had

00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,480
exception handling

00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:36,000
uh getting those regex right you know

00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:38,720
that's why we had that granular

00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,440
control we were repeatedly processing

00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:42,399
information

00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:43,600
over and over again um you know there's

00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:46,880
so much data that we

00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:48,559
couldn't possibly do it manually so we

00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:49,679
did have to rely on a lot of automated

00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:52,640
systems but

00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:54,080
you know like that iso example uh you

00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:57,840
know we could automate everything or

00:30:54,080 --> 00:31:00,399
at least it wasn't practical or um

00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:01,760
you know uh cost effective to automate

00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:05,919
everything and so

00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:09,039
we definitely did try and segment out

00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:09,679
and um and do them manually so i would

00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:11,600
say

00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:13,279
almost everything automated with some

00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:15,760
exceptions that were more on the

00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:17,360
practical standpoint

00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:19,039
so we're over time i see there's more

00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:22,000
