	00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:09,280
cool so

00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:10,880
um hopefully you can all hear me if

00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:13,440
someone can give me a

00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,440
thumbs up

00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:20,480
cool so um yeah

00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,840
fantastic so i'll kick off um so i'm

00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:25,279
here to talk about the

00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:28,080
uh the war on their pdfs

00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:28,880
and i'm just gonna cover the um a quick

00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,079
recap

00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:34,239
on pdfs you know why they're here

00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:36,079
and what sort of future i guess they

00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:39,920
they have

00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:42,960
um so is is there a war on pdfs

00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:45,440
um so it all started one as you can tell

00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,280
i'm from london uk hence my accent but

00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:50,800
it all started one

00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:53,360
december uh evening where i um

00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,000
i changed a nappy went for a run came

00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:57,039
home

00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,960
turned on the ipad and basically saw a

00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:01,680
tweet that made me think

00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:03,359
um it was by an official at government

00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:06,479
digital services in the uk

00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:08,720
and basically he he said that the war on

00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:11,680
pdf being a primary format on gov

00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,799
uk is finally over so it just made me

00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,000
think

00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:18,080
um obviously at cyberduck we're a

00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,640
digital agency we we have to deal with

00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:23,840
pdfs on a regular basis

00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,840
so it prompted me to write an article um

00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,280
that's not really the death of the pdf

00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,040
but it's still great news for

00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,280
accessibility

00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,159
so in in this talk today i'm exploring

00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:36,079
this kind of whole

00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:38,799
notion just a few words about cyberducks

00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:41,360
we're a global digital agency

00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:42,640
um and we're focused primarily on

00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,960
digital transformation

00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:47,040
through um inclusive design ux and

00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,320
obviously drupal so drupal is is not

00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,159
clearly

00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:52,079
a big thing for us otherwise we wouldn't

00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,880
be here today

00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:56,159
um just a couple of stats on the agency

00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:59,360
below

00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,920
um but yeah one p one billion people uh

00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:04,560
today

00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:07,360
live with a disability that makes um

00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,039
15 of the global population living with

00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,360
some type of disability now they could

00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:14,480
include temporary disabilities

00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:16,560
what we probably don't know is how many

00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:18,879
unreported cases of

00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,640
disabilities there are and there's also

00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:22,000
something called invisible disability so

00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,400
even if someone is disabled

00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,160
we may not even know that so roughly

00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,640
makes that one in five

00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:30,160
people in the uk have some sort of form

00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,959
of disability and one

00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:35,200
in four people in the us have some type

00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:38,000
of disability as well

00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:40,080
so are we moving towards a more

00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
accessible internet

00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,640
so first of all no other invention has

00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,760
really been more pivotal to humankind

00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:50,080
since uh gutenberg's printing press in

00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,840
in the 1400s

00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,599
so the world can definitely be at your

00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,599
fingertips if you can use a mouse

00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:56,800
and obviously see the screen and not the

00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:59,360
issue is not every

00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,879
everybody can saying that the internet

00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,760
is one of the best things

00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:05,920
that has ever happened to disabled uh

00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:08,159
people or people with disabilities

00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:10,959
um i just want to play a quick video

00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:13,920
from 2007 that shows what

00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:16,000
the inaccessible internet can do to to

00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,920
to people

00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,920
david morris is the senior policy

00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:22,080
adviser of the great london authority

00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,120
advising the london's male accessibility

00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,000
issues

00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,680
he has spinal muscular atrophy and uses

00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,959
a number of technologies to get up with

00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,480
his busy schedule

00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,720
but his favorite one is voice

00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,760
recognition accompanied with a bluetooth

00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,440
headset

00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,200
he's been using speech recognition

00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,120
software for almost 10 years

00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,239
and currently uses dragon naturally

00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:44,080
speaking

00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:47,120
price activated software enables me to

00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,599
actually compete on an equal basis in

00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,920
fact

00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:51,200
probably gives me an advantage because

00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:54,239
those people who are smart

00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,200
know the um voice activated software has

00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:57,840
reached a point

00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,760
now where it's very functional speech

00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,439
recognition software generally needs a

00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,840
bit of training before it can be used

00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:03,920
which

00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,439
puts most people off but the recently

00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,480
released dragon naturally speaking

00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:08,319
version 9

00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,920
plaintiff has overcome that hurdle and

00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,730
now could be used straight out of the

00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,200
box

00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:14,959
[Music]

00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,720
the blackberry is another bit of kit

00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,720
that david has in his bag

00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,840
although he likes the wrong functions he

00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,519
believes the design

00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:23,759
could be improved for many people

00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:26,000
disabled and left-handed

00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:28,000
for the first time in a long time i can

00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,400
act as a keyboard

00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,880
but it's also really inaccessible to me

00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:35,520
as a one-handed left-handed person

00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:37,120
with a stupid job wheel which is really

00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:40,479
difficult to use so i have to

00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:42,800
clone it upside down and it's

00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:44,800
a strange way of accessing emails but

00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:48,639
it's still very important

00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,639
the library who remembers that huh

00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:53,600
wow memories but anyway there's a

00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,960
variety of situational

00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,639
impairments as well so it's not

00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,840
permanent uh disabilities but

00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,960
situational so

00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:03,120
so when i for example had a baby i i had

00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,160
a sort of a situational motor impairment

00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,039
where

00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,720
you know it's essentially holding a baby

00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:11,600
in one hand constantly

00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:13,600
um my wife was doing a lot of traveling

00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,960
and literally had to use a laptop and a

00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,280
mobile phone

00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:19,759
equally like if if if you know one of

00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:21,360
our parents has a cataract removal then

00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:23,919
they'll have side issues and

00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,880
and all of a sudden you know they'll

00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:27,840
have the same

00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:29,919
problems that low vision users have so

00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,520
so it it's all kind of

00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:33,759
relative and we just need to be aware of

00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:36,960
these situations situational impairments

00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:37,440
that that exist so how does this sort of

00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,759
type

00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,120
how does this fit into my world and this

00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:44,160
whole kind of

00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:46,560
accessibility and pdf topic um so this

00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:49,039
is our client sport england

00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:51,360
cyber doctors help them to re-platform

00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:54,800
and rework their content on

00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,759
the drupal cms they have obviously

00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,919
thousands of

00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:59,919
pages and other websites we had to

00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:00,880
migrate there was a it was a migration

00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:02,960
project

00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,960
and they also have hundreds of pdfs as

00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,560
well

00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,000
and as part of obviously working with

00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:11,360
them we we pulled in

00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,520
um users with disabilities to basically

00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,479
look at their experience so this is the

00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,720
real deal and

00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:18,160
it's kind of ongoing uh work that we're

00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,440
doing with them and in this particular

00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,440
user test

00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,880
the pdfs are accessible but they're a

00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,560
lot more fiddly

00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,240
it's also important to mention that

00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,560
these pdfs we're looking at

00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,759
in this particular test that before

00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,520
they've been optimized

00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:33,520
to one of the jobs that we have at the

00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,520
moment is to help support england

00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:37,360
improve some of their pdfs because they

00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,479
will probably keep some of them but we

00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,919
can improve them

00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:41,840
and that's what we're doing but in in

00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:43,199
these particular older pdfs the keyboard

00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:46,400
shortcuts

00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:48,400
are not working um the blind users don't

00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:51,120
have that familiarity with the document

00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:53,039
unlike html where they can move around

00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,039
at greater ease

00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:57,599
so pdfs should really have a table of

00:06:55,039 --> 00:07:00,720
content at the beginning that

00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:02,960
are available um pdfs can remember the

00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:06,400
last page which is good for sort of long

00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:07,120
form contents but in html they can also

00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,800
have

00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,319
links that help them with heading tabs

00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,319
to quickly navigate through the document

00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:14,080
so i just wanted to show you

00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:16,800
a really quick video now what you'll see

00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:19,599
here is is is a blind user

00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,400
um talking about his experience viewing

00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:23,919
a pdf

00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:31,520
on a on a smartphone so if he's using um

00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:33,280
apple uh voiceover

00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,560
more inclusive despite more than one

00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,840
hundred thousand organizations

00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,039
delivering a wide range of physical

00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,080
activity offers many people in

00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:39,759
communities

00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:41,599
often unconsciously stop what is

00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:44,960
happening level it also means our talent

00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:44,960
pathways don't represent our

00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,800
more than physical activity by

00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:59,039
organizing arranged by people it could

00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,039
be anything

00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:13,120
the pdf on the mobile is the

00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:13,120
hardest terms

00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:29,840
and he's a very uh very smart guy very

00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,199
sort of technically savvy with with

00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:34,240
computers he can

00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:36,240
talk at ease at like you know w3c uh

00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,399
wackex standards he knows a lot about

00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:41,440
accessibility

00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:43,760
and just moves on here um

00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,200
so so the results from um this

00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:48,560
particular test

00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:51,279
um is as per what um

00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,399
the user said is html offered the best

00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:54,880
particular experience

00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:55,519
he scored that nine nine stars out of

00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,399
ten

00:08:55,519 --> 00:09:00,080
or nine and a half mobile on html was

00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:02,880
kind of the second best

00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:04,560
experience with um the desktop kind of

00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:07,120
pdf being

00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,720
okay i mean he did complain about you

00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,120
know navigation through the document

00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,680
wasn't good and mobile was definitely

00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:15,040
the worst

00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:18,560
experience uh for him

00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:20,800
so our pdfs and and and the web broker

00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:23,200
so so before we answer that question

00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:26,720
let's look at why the pdf was invented

00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:28,240
um it was basically invented as a way to

00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,839
send documents i mean we all probably

00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,040
remember this in the late 90s where you

00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:33,279
would get an attachment and you

00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,240
basically you just couldn't open it

00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:36,560
because you didn't have the right

00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:38,240
software or plug-in so it was kind of

00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:41,040
created as a universal

00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:43,120
format um you know to create that

00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,600
element of portability that anybody can

00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,160
open

00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:48,000
a document anywhere and in an interview

00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,600
the founder of kind of the

00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,279
co-founder of adobe john warnock

00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:54,399
invented the pdf said that

00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:56,160
html you know is a joke and they've

00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:57,680
spent 20 years trying to fix it so

00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:00,160
clearly there's a bit of a

00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,880
you know conflict going on there um

00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:03,440
between

00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:05,200
you know the inventor of the pdf and in

00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:07,279
html

00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,519
but why do pdfs exist they're a

00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:11,519
universal standard for consistent uh

00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:14,560
print design that their standardized

00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:16,399
format recognized by governments and

00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:18,480
officials all over the world that

00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:20,959
they're portable they're easy to send

00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,399
to save and read offline and arguably

00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:24,240
archive as well

00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:25,519
and it's also a good format if you if

00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,320
you have sort of pieces of paper that

00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:28,160
you need to scan

00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:30,800
and sort of digitize it uses something

00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:32,880
called ocr technology

00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:34,320
and also it's a very low barrier for

00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,640
production so anybody that uses

00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:39,839
microsoft word can use a

00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:41,360
you know can create the pdf so are our

00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:43,920
pdfs popular

00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,720
in 2021 you'd think that they aren't but

00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:48,079
actually

00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:50,079
um adobe's vp of engineering estimates

00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:52,320
the 2.5

00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:54,240
trillion pdf stock documents in the

00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:56,320
world and it's essentially if you type

00:10:54,240 --> 00:11:00,000
in how do i convert to

00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:02,480
um pdfs essentially overtake

00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,920
major religions which is which is i find

00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,560
hysterical

00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,760
um and if you look at the search volume

00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:10,079
on google

00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:13,120
trends you'll see that over time since

00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:16,320
2004 there's arguably even more

00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:18,720
people searching for pdf documents on

00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,920
online so there's a lot of chatter

00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,320
online saying that

00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:24,160
pdfs are not accessible and i completely

00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,440
understand if many of you have have

00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,200
strong views on

00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,120
on this matter so i'd love to kind of

00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,360
see you know your

00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,240
your kind of thoughts in the chat later

00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,880
um but do

00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:36,320
do do actually pdfs this is the big

00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:39,519
question here do they have a role

00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:41,279
on on the web um so i think i think

00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:43,360
before we answer that there's

00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:44,320
there's a startup called accessory that

00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,160
did a um

00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,360
a survey they actually found that even

00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:50,480
on html

00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:53,760
uh websites 98 of navigation

00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:57,760
menus do not work another study

00:11:53,760 --> 00:12:02,160
here by usablenet said that 97

00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:05,760
top websites fail the ada test

00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:06,720
so if we if we frame that with a pdf in

00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,959
mind

00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,160
the internet is not just about pdfs

00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:13,279
users use word

00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:16,959
and you know other formats like epub

00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:19,440
and some industries um sort of require a

00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:20,959
pdf almost by kind of

00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,480
the very nature of how they do things

00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:23,680
like annual reports for listed

00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,160
businesses

00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:27,360
posters that need to be circulated in in

00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,519
in police stations

00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,040
that need to be emailed and some of them

00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:33,680
printed

00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:35,760
there's um also the publishing

00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:37,839
experience that some of us may prefer

00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:39,839
to to create pdfs simply because it's

00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:42,880
easier and the other i guess

00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:43,680
topic around pdfs is it's it's hard to

00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,920
test them

00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:47,519
so there is obviously tool validation

00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:49,680
but it's not it's not really enough and

00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:51,600
we'll talk a bit about that later

00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,200
and obviously pdfs are still popular so

00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:56,639
there's no kind of hiding

00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:58,320
from that and in stock markets annual

00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:00,480
reports are arguably

00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:02,399
driving the pdf boom it's probably due

00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:05,120
to the print heritage

00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:05,440
um and a lot of the users that we speak

00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,560
to

00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:11,440
see pdfs as being kind of robust safe

00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:14,399
and unhackable even the blind user that

00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,279
i showed you earlier he he saves his own

00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:18,480
kind of notes

00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:20,160
and documents as pdfs because he sees it

00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:23,519
as a very robust

00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:25,200
format certain kind of eu regulated

00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,560
listed companies now must produce their

00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,880
annual reports not as

00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:30,560
pdfs but something called the european

00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:32,240
single electronic format which is

00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:34,959
essentially an xhtml

00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:36,639
xml file and so that's an interesting

00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:38,320
trend that we've spotted

00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:40,240
and certain visually impaired users that

00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:42,560
we spoke to prefer kind of long

00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:44,079
form pdfs particularly reading those

00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:45,040
kind of pdfs providing that they're

00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:47,600
accessible

00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,240
on ipads because if they close down the

00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,360
um

00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:52,000
you know their ipad or or the app when

00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,399
they open

00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,839
uh apple books they come back exactly to

00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:57,279
the same place

00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:59,440
that they're on so they don't have to go

00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:01,040
through the web browser or google

00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,800
to basically to find things and they

00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:06,079
just find that um

00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:07,120
easier um but many pdfs are completely

00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:08,800
inaccessible so

00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,800
i'm just trying to look at all sides of

00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,480
the story here so in this particular

00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,880
video that you see

00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:17,519
um the pdf has essentially been been

00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:18,800
sort of scanned and it's inaccessible

00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:21,279
because it probably hasn't gone through

00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:23,120
the ocr conversion and even when they do

00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:26,079
go through the ocr conversion you do

00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:29,839
tend to get a lot of a lot of garbage

00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:31,360
out of that as well obviously um

00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:32,000
governments are playing a major role

00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:35,120
here

00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:39,120
in the uk pdfs must be um so pdfs are

00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:41,199
used they need to comply with 2018

00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,560
accessibility regulations so that that's

00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:45,360
an interesting one

00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:48,000
and in the us pdfs need to be section

00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:50,800
508 compliance and also accessible

00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
machine readable it's again going to be

00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:54,639
tagged properly

00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,240
so there's it's very positive to see

00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:58,560
these sort of things

00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,519
happen as well and despite the amazing

00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,920
strides that

00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:02,959
um at least government digital services

00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,279
are making

00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:06,880
they were sued uh literally two months

00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:09,680
ago by a blind woman

00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:10,480
who was complaining that she's receiving

00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:13,519
a print

00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,480
um format about covert guidance and she

00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:17,760
would rather receive

00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:19,120
emails or audio cds because she prefers

00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:21,600
to get information

00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:24,480
um in an audio format and not in a

00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:26,720
printed format so it's quite interesting

00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,560
that even with all the kind of the um

00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,240
advancements that governments are making

00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,079
they still can't seem to get certain

00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:35,680
things rights

00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:36,800
so the war on pdfs i think is a symptom

00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,639
of a wider problem

00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,800
are we in fact obsessing over the wrong

00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:43,040
issue there are other

00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:45,279
issues like inaccessible html apps and

00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:47,360
even inaccessible ebooks the war

00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:48,639
should not be on pdfs the war should not

00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:51,120
even be a war but

00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:53,360
a battle for inclusivity this can only

00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:55,680
be done if we collaborate with

00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:58,480
users with disabilities so i think the

00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:01,279
designers and developers need to work

00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:02,720
with users with this disabilities like

00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:04,560
blind users and

00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,320
deaf users and people with people with

00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:08,399
motor impairments

00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:10,639
and and just sort of design solutions

00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:14,240
that work for these audiences

00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:15,920
um despite all of this legislation um

00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:18,560
visually impaired users are still not a

00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:21,600
priority for many sectors

00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:23,440
so so only you know 44

00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,120
of blind people are unemployed compared

00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:27,920
to 77

00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:29,519
of people without disabilities so it

00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:32,560
shows you that there is

00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:34,639
a problem um but blind

00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:37,360
people make a huge contribution to our

00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:39,680
society from obviously engineers

00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,959
facebook all the way to artists like

00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:43,759
stevie wonder

00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:46,079
and olympic athletes who who who are

00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:46,079
blind

00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:50,800
and obviously what we're seeing now um

00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:54,480
is is kind of

00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:57,519
activists and blind users basically

00:16:54,480 --> 00:17:01,279
starting to complain and and and

00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:03,360
there's lawsuits now um around kind of

00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:05,360
job application processes on websites

00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:07,120
that we're seeing more and more and more

00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:09,439
so i think it's simply because the

00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:10,319
barrier for someone blind applying for a

00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:13,679
job

00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:15,439
is it isn't um it's just there are a big

00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:18,160
barriers there at the moment on

00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:19,600
on the internet and that's with html

00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,959
websites as well

00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:23,919
so this is where i think inclusive

00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:27,520
design is really really important

00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:28,799
um so if everybody lives long enough

00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,559
they'll experience at least

00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:32,400
one kind of eye condition in their in

00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:35,520
their lifetime so

00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:39,280
to 2.4 percent of americans have

00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:41,679
are blind or have low low low vision

00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:44,559
um so we need to be able as designers

00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:46,559
and developers and engineers

00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:47,919
to understand the disability categories

00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:51,039
obviously there's sites

00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:53,520
which is kind of impaired users um

00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:54,320
or no vision and then there's users that

00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:57,679
have motor

00:17:54,320 --> 00:18:00,400
motor issues over limbs and control

00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:02,400
and then there's users with cognitive

00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:04,080
impairments around learning and language

00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:07,520
as well as well as auditory

00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:10,400
um as well so

00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:12,880
to make things better for blind people

00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:15,039
society needs to transform

00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,400
on a social attitudinal and

00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:18,240
environmental level and when we talk

00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:21,600
about environment it's not just

00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:23,360
a user entering a building you know

00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,880
easily with a wheelchair it's also the

00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:29,440
digital environments the

00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:33,520
the internet the world wide web as well

00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:35,840
at least 2.2 billion people have um

00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:36,880
some sort of vision impairment and low

00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,720
vision users

00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,919
are continuing to struggle this is a

00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,720
fight for them and

00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:45,360
and i want us to be part of the solution

00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:47,919
not part of the problem

00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,720
assistive technology is also changing um

00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:50,480
to screen

00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,640
readers and audio books are gradually

00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:56,320
replacing braille in the uk and the us

00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,880
to a point where in in the uk and in the

00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:00,000
us

00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,880
less than ten percent of um of blind

00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,679
people now

00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,160
are actually using braille um which is

00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:07,840
um

00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:09,760
again a revelation um and also

00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:11,520
um the world of technology is constantly

00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:14,880
introducing new formats

00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:17,440
so so like epub for example where

00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:19,120
that's kind of replacing uh the pdf now

00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:21,760
as a format of choice for

00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:23,679
for for ebooks it's got better

00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:25,440
connectivity to things like screen

00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:28,799
readers it allows users to

00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:31,679
sort of reflow the text so it's a really

00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:34,799
really interesting

00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:38,799
developments as well so can

00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:40,640
accessibility be mainstream well

00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:42,880
mainstream technology like alexa has

00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:45,760
actually really helped

00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:46,880
visually impaired users where they can

00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:49,760
now set reminders

00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:51,919
check check the weather get the news use

00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,559
incidents of things at home that's iot

00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:54,000
there

00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:55,919
manage their calendars and listen to

00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:59,200
music i just want to share a video

00:19:55,919 --> 00:20:00,640
a quick one-minute video from the royal

00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,360
national institute of blind people in

00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:07,840
the uk

00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:07,840
and amazon

00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:32,840
alexa what's the time it's 6 am

00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:35,840
[Music]

00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:35,840
oh

00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:40,220
[Music]

00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:48,620
alexa what's the weather like right now

00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:52,100
currently it's my train

00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:52,100
[Music]

00:20:56,330 --> 00:20:59,410
[Music]

00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:11,120
so there are still limitations around um

00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:13,360
alexa's capability to read the web and

00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:15,919
and pdfs obviously if you look at this

00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:17,760
um thread from reddick it kind of

00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:21,760
summarizes it it's not really

00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:25,679
possible but what about accessibility

00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:27,760
it kind of benefiting all of us

00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:29,120
does it benefit all of us so i just

00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:31,360
wanted to

00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:32,559
play another video here again very very

00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:36,080
quick video

00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:36,080
that talks about the power of

00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:47,200
could help subtitles your child's life

00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:51,440
forever

00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:52,320
yes that's it just turn on the subtitles

00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,400
extraordinary

00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:55,760
research has shown that they can double

00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,080
the chance of a child

00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:59,600
becoming good at reading you don't have

00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:01,600
to tell them you're doing it

00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:04,640
they probably won't even notice it'll

00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,640
work it's magic

00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:10,159
so as we've seen um in this video from

00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,400
stephen fry

00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:14,320
it's it's the power of accessibility is

00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,880
is is tremendous and i think this is

00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:18,240
where

00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:21,280
um you know the w3c is put is pushing

00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:22,240
uh the poor guidelines where essentially

00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:24,240
what that means is

00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:26,720
its content needs to be perceivable so

00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:28,880
available to all of the sensors

00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:30,559
operable where users can interact with

00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,960
with controls and that doesn't have to

00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:32,400
be

00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,880
you know button controls it could be

00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:37,919
voice controls content needs to be

00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:41,440
understandable clear without jargon and

00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:45,039
confusion and it also needs to be robust

00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:46,320
to not only um legacy technology but

00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:49,280
also future

00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:49,679
technology like personal assistance and

00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:52,960
and

00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:54,320
voice as well so what about the drupal

00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:57,120
community

00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:57,679
um love this photo um so we recently had

00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,480
dries

00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:01,360
coming into our cyberduck developer town

00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,600
hall

00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:05,120
saying that accessibility is at the core

00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,960
of drupal and that's something that i

00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:08,799
love and i'm so proud to be part of this

00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:10,880
community

00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:12,400
so proud because i think the reason why

00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:15,600
drupal is so

00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:18,799
popular is because of its emphasis on

00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:22,240
accessibility um so this is a quote from

00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:25,919
reese in 2013.

00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:27,280
now um there's a sort of an obvious

00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:29,280
rallying cry around

00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:31,280
accessibility from the drupal community

00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,880
and nothing gets signed off

00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:34,320
within the drupal core without an

00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,960
accessibility review

00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:38,080
there's also accessibility reviews of

00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,919
other modules

00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:41,120
and obviously drupal has many built-in

00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:44,159
features around

00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:45,919
um accessibility that you'll be aware of

00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:47,200
here are some of them and it's not just

00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:49,840
html

00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:51,440
drupal guidelines also encourage

00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:54,640
accessibility to other types of

00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:56,799
documents like pdfs

00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,919
so so i think we can use and should be

00:23:56,799 --> 00:24:00,159
using

00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:01,440
methodologies to make the web more

00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:03,120
accessible

00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,720
so as i mentioned earlier governments

00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,520
are driving accessibility forward

00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,840
through inclusive

00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,640
design government digital services in

00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,480
the uk

00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:13,520
are making tremendous strides with the

00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:16,400
accessibility regulation 2018

00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:17,120
it became law and then um recently

00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,360
there's been

00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:21,279
been further further developments and

00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:23,200
further laws as well

00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:25,440
um but yeah there's some fantastic

00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:27,039
developments

00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:29,120
one thing that we need to remember and i

00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:31,120
think the the lawsuit that we saw from

00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:32,720
from the blind person is is kind of a

00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:34,400
reminder it's not all

00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,919
impairments or equal there's a large

00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:39,360
scale especially around

00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:42,320
visual impairment where obviously 20 20

00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:44,320
um is considered the best vision and and

00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:45,600
if if if the vision fits within like a

00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:47,279
20 70 range

00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:49,039
the users will probably start using

00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:52,559
magnifying tools

00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:54,720
and then anything above 2200

00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:57,039
essentially means that users would be

00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,360
probably using screen readers like jaws

00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:59,760
or

00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:01,760
apple voice servers it's just something

00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:04,000
that as designers and developers we need

00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:06,000
to remember

00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,159
um this is where i think you know

00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,960
inclusive design principles can really

00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:10,480
help us

00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:12,720
i mean i love this particular one and

00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:14,000
you can you can get i'll obviously post

00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:16,320
these slides online later

00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,200
where you can get um access to all of

00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:19,919
this

00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:21,360
but you can see here that um you know

00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:22,960
there's some really good principles

00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:25,120
around accessibility and

00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:26,480
you know a web for everyone with

00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:28,080
cyberduck we also

00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,760
everything that we do involves a lot of

00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:32,720
research with with users

00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:33,440
and all types of personas um i really

00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:37,360
love this

00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:38,960
um this quote from from mike as well

00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:40,240
where he's saying that in html for

00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:42,720
example

00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:44,559
um you can almost bookmark a place on

00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,960
the page i wasn't even aware of it until

00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:46,400
mike

00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,880
told me about it so it's almost kind of

00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:51,120
mimicking the bookmark function

00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:53,279
of what you can do in a pdf doing it in

00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:55,279
an html which is extremely

00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:56,799
amazing news for accessibility so thanks

00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:59,760
again mike

00:25:56,799 --> 00:26:01,440
fit for your words of wisdom there so

00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:02,240
does all of this mean that pdfs will

00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:04,080
disappear

00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:06,080
well some things i think will remain as

00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:08,840
pdfs like if you're if you need to

00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:10,080
publish or print um or save a

00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:12,240
certificate

00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:13,600
i think you know what what are you going

00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,720
to do are you going to save it as an

00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:17,600
html file

00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:19,039
or as a pdf also somebody sends you a

00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:21,919
document to print

00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:24,880
for a web signature would you be

00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:26,799
inclined to print an html file or a pdf

00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:29,039
and if you need to capture let's say

00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:31,679
strategic um

00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:33,600
minutes would you rather how which

00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:35,600
format would you prefer to save those

00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:38,159
those records with a view that you need

00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:39,840
to view them in like 15 years or or 20

00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:42,080
years what sort of format would you go

00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:44,640
for and why

00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:46,000
so to create accessible so clearly i

00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:48,320
don't think that pdfs are going to

00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,640
disappear and i think

00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:52,559
there are some really good guides that

00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:54,080
allow you to make pdfs more more

00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:56,400
accessible for example

00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:58,000
cyberduck have created a pdf

00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,880
accessibility checklist that you can

00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,880
download

00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:02,320
there's a really good guide for word

00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:04,640
docs in particular

00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:06,400
from the university of washington and

00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:07,840
adobe provides some really good

00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:10,559
guidances around

00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:11,520
using adobe indesign so so this is

00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:13,600
because if you want to create an

00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:15,679
accessible pdf you need to do it

00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:17,200
using the talk you need to start by

00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:20,000
doing it using the tool

00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:21,440
and obviously involve users as well we

00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,320
also created a

00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:24,960
pdf audit template on air tables if you

00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,960
have

00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:30,080
hundreds of pdfs that you need to

00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:33,440
download feel free to use this this free

00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:34,720
airtable resource as well that we

00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:37,120
created

00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:38,640
um back to html you know there's a lot

00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:40,480
more i think it's much more mature so

00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:42,320
html is clearly

00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,840
much more kind of mature when it comes

00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:46,399
down to inclusive design

00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:47,039
it has like if you're a designer figma

00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:48,880
provide

00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:51,039
you know accessibility kits that you can

00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:52,720
use the bacon kind of

00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:54,720
accessible pattern libraries from the

00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:57,840
very beginning

00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:58,960
what else can we do to make content more

00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:02,880
accessible

00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:06,080
so i think um

00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:08,480
yeah this is a really really good um

00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:09,840
point here that the average reading age

00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:12,080
of a sizable

00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:12,880
uh proportion of the adult populations

00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,799
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:16,000
is similar to an 11 year old and i know

00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:18,240
in the us

00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,440
you know you guys are really working

00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:21,840
hard making

00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:23,600
content um much more readable and that

00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:26,320
the flesh kinkade test

00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:27,200
sort of helps you to almost and there's

00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:29,760
some really good

00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:30,640
um tests online you can put your content

00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:32,880
in to see

00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:34,159
how readable it is but the complex text

00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,679
is a huge barrier

00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:37,840
and this is where kind of the flesh

00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:40,640
kinky test comes in

00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:42,640
you can i guess the steps you need to

00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:44,080
take is short in your sentences reduce

00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:46,399
the number of long words

00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:48,480
write for your audience get rid of all

00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:50,799
the jargon that you would normally use

00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:52,240
and make punctuation your friend and

00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:56,399
have a a great

00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:57,039
structure as well what about sort of ai

00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:59,679
or in

00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:01,279
in publishing so it's it's a drupal and

00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:04,000
there's a module in drupal

00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:06,559
which we haven't used before but

00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:09,919
somebody's pointed it out to us

00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:13,120
it allows you to create um automatic

00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:13,760
all tags using microsoft cognitive

00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:16,080
services

00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:17,039
it's using like ai to basically describe

00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,559
images now

00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:20,399
we still feel that it's going to need

00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:21,600
some human intervention and human

00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:23,200
supervision but

00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:25,120
if you have hundreds of images that you

00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:27,039
need to put into

00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:28,240
your content it could or thousands it

00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:31,600
could potentially

00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:33,279
save you a lot of time um so i just want

00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:36,080
to quickly talk about testing

00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:37,120
um accessibility toolbars and not a

00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:39,200
substitute for

00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:40,880
good accessible design development

00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:43,840
research and testing

00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:45,279
don't rely on a third party toolbar to

00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:48,720
make your website um

00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:51,039
accessible we still have a long way to

00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:53,120
go i mean when print prince philip died

00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:56,159
last week

00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:59,279
the national rail which um basically

00:29:56,159 --> 00:30:01,360
um made their website grayscale um

00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:03,760
there was a massive backfire where you

00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:05,120
know mass media jumped all over this and

00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:07,120
said you know

00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:08,240
we've lost the plot in the uk that we

00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:10,159
make a website

00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:12,480
grayscale and therefore inaccessible and

00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:14,480
actually this gentleman here

00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:16,240
is saying you know hate to be pedantic

00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:18,480
but um

00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:19,440
there were already accessibility issues

00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:22,480
on that website

00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:25,279
even before it became gray scale and

00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:26,000
in fact it could have remained grace

00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:27,919
accessible

00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,120
as a grayscale website so it's quite an

00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:31,039
interesting debate

00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:33,200
on twitter there if you really want to

00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:34,880
um look into that

00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:37,520
um and i think that this is a really

00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:40,960
good principle uh from sandy uh

00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:44,720
westmore who is a fantastic um

00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:46,880
lady she's blind herself and and used to

00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:48,559
design things and and work in various

00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:50,399
kind of organizations

00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:52,640
but she said you know be welcoming don't

00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:55,440
discriminate engage with people

00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:56,320
create user experiences and make sure

00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:58,320
that they have

00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:59,519
really valuable outcomes and i think the

00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:01,919
only way you're going to generate

00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:04,559
valuable outcomes is taking your html

00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:06,080
or or pdfs or ebooks or whatever it is

00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:06,480
that you're publishing and just testing

00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,880
them

00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:10,640
with users throughout the entire project

00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:12,159
life cycle

00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:14,159
so just some we're out of time now i

00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:17,679
just wanted to summarize

00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:20,399
um only together we can make

00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:22,240
the internet a more accessible place we

00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:24,720
need to consider the poor principles

00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:26,440
and bake them in um it's horses for

00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,600
courses so there's no sort of

00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:31,200
one-size-fits-all

00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:32,480
approach pdfs are here to stay

00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:34,880
especially around

00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:36,080
official documents and portability and i

00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:39,279
spoke to a number of

00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:40,720
um blind users about this who feel that

00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:43,440
when i was preparing for my talk you

00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:45,519
feel the pdfs are here to stay and that

00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:47,120
they can be made more accessible

00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:49,679
so we should we should look at that i

00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:51,120
still feel that html is generally the

00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:53,840
better format just for

00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:55,440
quickly reading information and viewing

00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:56,880
things online for sure there's no

00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:58,559
there's no question about it

00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:01,360
and you need to test test and test and

00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:04,320
employ specialist agencies or

00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:05,360
bring in less abled uh users to do those

00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:07,760
tests for you

00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:09,919
and when producing content consider you

00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:12,399
know ai not only as a

00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:13,120
on the user side but also from the

00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:16,480
publishing

00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:18,559
uh perspective as well um

00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:20,240
we do have a booth here at drupalcon so

00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:21,600
we'd love to to meet you here

00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:24,080
one of my colleagues did a talk

00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:26,840
yesterday about how you can bake in

00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:29,279
accessibility uh throughout the project

00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:29,679
um life cycle as well i just wanted to

00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:32,640
say

00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:33,279
a couple of thanks to um mike gifford

00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:36,799
from

00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:38,000
civic actions for the tips around html

00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:41,440
accessibility

00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:45,039
and of course to sandy uh westma

00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:48,159
and then steve green at um test partners

00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:49,679
so thanks a lot um

00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:51,360
yeah obviously i don't know how much

00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:54,840
more time i i have

00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:57,840
and whether there is an opportunity for

00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,840
questions

00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:03,119
[Music]

00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:16,240
so i'll just quickly go into the q a um

00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:18,159
yeah in terms of two uh tools for

00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:19,360
testing the accessibility of pdfs i mean

00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:22,880
i think one of the first

00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:24,880
places is acrobat professional um

00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:26,240
i think there are a couple of links in

00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:28,480
in the deck as well and

00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:30,960
and i will to answer shannon i will

00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:34,159
share um the link to the deck

00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:36,480
um but yet to answer your question josh

00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:38,559
there'll be some some i'll provide some

00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:40,399
links as well to various tools

00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:42,320
but ultimately nothing's going to

00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:43,919
replace

00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:45,919
you know let's say a visually impaired

00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:48,320
user who can test the pdf

00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:48,320
for you

00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:53,840
um

00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:58,399
yes in terms of making pdfs um

00:33:56,159 --> 00:34:01,279
accessible there's an anonymous

00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:01,519
question there i think it needs to start

00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:04,559
in

00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:07,760
in whether using indesign or or or word

00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:09,599
if there's a slide in in my deck that um

00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:11,760
it's got some great links so we we we

00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:14,720
produced it we produced um

00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:15,440
a checklist ourselves you can you can

00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:19,679
use

00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:20,960
um and in terms of um eileen's question

00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:24,639
um

00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:25,679
converting um pdfs and websites that

00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:28,000
have valuable

00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:29,919
uh backlinks what is a best practice to

00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,879
convert the pdfs without breaking the

00:34:29,919 --> 00:34:32,399
backlink

00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:34,560
i mean again it depends it really does

00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:34,879
depend does it really need to be a pdf i

00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:38,079
mean

00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:39,919
i'd you know if it can be an html

00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:42,560
page it's probably better if it has to

00:34:39,919 --> 00:34:44,960
be a pdf for various reasons

00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:46,639
then um you know you could you could

00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:48,000
potentially use the same link put an

00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:50,399
html page there

00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,320
and then offer both an html version and

00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:54,480
a pdf version that i mean

00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:56,399
in you know what government digital

00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:57,760
services is saying in the public sector

00:34:56,399 --> 00:35:00,960
that it's law now

00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:02,160
to have an html equivalent of every pdf

00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:04,960
page as well so

00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:05,280
so i think it's just that's probably

00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:08,560
where

00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:08,560
where we're heading in the future

00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:13,520
so hopefully i've answered um all your

00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,160
questions i don't know how much more

00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:17,839
time

00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:17,839
