	00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,080
uh we're gonna do uh technical

00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:05,040
architecture with drupal and other

00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:08,559
systems

00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:11,840
uh today uh so that

00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:13,280
a nice brief title um

00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,280
means basically what we're gonna do is

00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:18,560
we're gonna go over a little bit

00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:19,359
of how i and sort of how uh us at acro

00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,800
as well

00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:24,080
um go over top level technical

00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,599
architecture planning when we're

00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:28,720
integrating drupal with

00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:30,160
a much larger uh setup usually for sort

00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,239
of an enterprise client or something

00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:35,040
like that although it can vary

00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:37,120
uh you know some we've got some clients

00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,040
that you know are a three-person team

00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:41,040
and they have very complex technical

00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,160
setups

00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,079
uh this is going to be a bit of a

00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:46,480
hypothetical example um

00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:48,640
i didn't take a specific client although

00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:52,000
it's kind of based off of a few

00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:55,520
uh that we have it's also going to be

00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,079
a little bit uh

00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,600
e-commerce focused we tend to do a lot

00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,199
of e-commerce that's that's mostly what

00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,359
we do is we do drupal and we do

00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:05,600
e-commerce uh so that's what the idea is

00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:06,560
or the demo is a little slanted for uh

00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:11,119
but the same

00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:12,400
principles should uh work for

00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:14,320
anything else that that doesn't have

00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:17,920
e-commerce and i'll try not to to have

00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:17,920
it too e-commerce focused

00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:24,000
okay uh who am i uh and that arrow

00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,960
actually appears to have worked out

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,240
correctly

00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:30,720
um sean mccabe i'm the cto at acromedia

00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:33,840
i've been doing drupal for

00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:35,680
13 or something years um

00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,759
it's probably about what my d.o profile

00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:40,960
says i've been working at acro for 14

00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:42,479
or almost 14 years now doing technical

00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,159
architecture for a lot of that although

00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:45,920
i did start as a junior developer so it

00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,479
took a bit to work my way up before i

00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,159
was doing

00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:50,000
architecture but hopefully i have lots

00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:53,520
of experience at this and

00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,720
should do a good job um i did actually

00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,159
have one more slide i was going to put

00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,920
in here which i was in the process of

00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:00,479
editing when i thought this was

00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,680
happening at 11 pacific and not 9

00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:03,920
pacific

00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,880
um in my defense i have a three month

00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,239
old uh

00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:10,239
baby so i'll use that um as an excuse

00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:12,000
for why i couldn't understand time zones

00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:14,879
although i know ryan serrama

00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
did his talk on time um and he is like a

00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:19,200
three week old baby

00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,400
so maybe it's not a perfect excuse

00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:24,160
um but uh what we're going to do here is

00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:28,239
i have sort of a hypothetical

00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:32,239
site example um

00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:34,080
that a client uh has an existing site

00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:37,840
they're looking to sort of move away

00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:39,440
you know from maybe a couple of

00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,120
you know platforms and we're gonna be

00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,120
sort of adding drupal into their system

00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,319
to give them cms functionality and also

00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,920
maybe replace

00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:47,519
uh some of their other systems and so

00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,239
i'm gonna sort of do a quick walkthrough

00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:51,360
of

00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:52,800
what we do uh for that process uh we

00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,239
have templates instead that we use i've

00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,120
sort of simplified them a little for the

00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:57,040
slides

00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,879
uh so that things will move along and

00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,959
this this is gonna be maybe go a little

00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:02,000
fast but uh i hope to get sort of all

00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:05,120
the detail

00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,720
um in here so first of all

00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,400
uh what we usually like to do is we

00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:11,840
start off with an

00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,840
audit of

00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:15,760
uh what um

00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:21,519
uh systems you know or pieces of

00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:24,239
functionality that uh

00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:25,920
a client probably does already have um

00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:26,319
this is actually a slightly truncated

00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,920
list

00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:29,440
of the one we use normally i just had to

00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:32,480
truncate it to fit it all

00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,840
um on one slide here um and as you see

00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,360
it's a little ecommerce focused and

00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,200
sometimes we'll we'll tune this for

00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,799
different clients here

00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,879
but we sort of try to say hey here's all

00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:44,400
the kind of pieces of functionality that

00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:44,400
you'll have um

00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:49,440
and you know what do you use currently

00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:51,200
to maintain this and and we provide this

00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:54,319
list because we find if we just ask

00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:56,000
clients uh about their

00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:57,920
systems and what they have they'll list

00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
like three of the eight systems they

00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:02,640
actually have because they won't

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
uh you know remember certain parts that

00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,439
are done or that that'll come from a

00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,720
different department and then

00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:08,159
you know whoever we're talking about

00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,519
won't have this perfect knowledge of

00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:12,640
sort of the whole

00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:14,000
uh system so we'll sort of go through

00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,439
and we'll maybe ask

00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,519
you know the client to get some initial

00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:18,400
stuff and we'll get a list sort of

00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,239
something like this

00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:22,000
they'll say okay you know products or

00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:25,360
product data comes from netsuite

00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:29,280
you know we're using magento for catalog

00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,919
cart checkout um you know our customers

00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,440
are sort of

00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:32,960
or in this case i put users to be a

00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,080
little more generic but they're stored

00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,320
in salesforce

00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,120
we sort of do erp functionality with

00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,280
netsuite

00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,800
if you don't work in commerce much erp

00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,880
is just like an awful buzzword that

00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,919
could mean almost anything

00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:47,759
usually means does order stuff

00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:50,560
but it could be accounting it could be

00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:53,199
uh whatever and let's say then they do

00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,639
order management through magento um and

00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:55,199
then they've forgotten sort of what they

00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:57,360
do

00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:58,720
over anything else and then once we give

00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,600
them this list

00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,560
uh we'll sort of prod them a little bit

00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,919
and it'll

00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,600
usually turn out that there's actually a

00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:08,080
few more things

00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:10,880
that they forgot that for search uh in

00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,919
fact they do use elasticsearch

00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,919
and they have that running you know

00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:15,440
they'll talk to someone i t in it and

00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:17,039
we'll figure that out and then we'll get

00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,800
you know analytics oh no one ever

00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:20,160
remembers to mention analytics and we

00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,479
say what do you use oh it's usually

00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,919
google analytics or something but

00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:25,360
we'll get that in there because you know

00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:27,039
it is important to make sure that still

00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,440
gets hooked up and

00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:31,120
uh do they have any marketing staff uh

00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,600
sure mailchimp you know we'll put that

00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,240
in there

00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,199
it's maybe a pretty simple setup and

00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,919
then what we'll usually

00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:40,080
uh do next and this can be done sort of

00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:41,759
formally or a little bit informally

00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,520
um and some of this might come from say

00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,080
an rfp or something but we'll ask them

00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,960
sort of

00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:48,560
what's their how much do they like or

00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,320
dislike the various pieces of software

00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,240
that they're using what are they sort of

00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,919
you know what do they like uh what are

00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,199
they tied to that kind of stuff and so

00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:57,919
we'll sort of go through

00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,880
and we will get things like you know we

00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:00,960
hate hate hate

00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,000
you know using netsuite for managing

00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,080
products or something

00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,840
here um i made these arbitrarily

00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,199
although netsuite is a little used or

00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,800
unfriendly so hopefully there's not a

00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:11,919
rep from netsuite

00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:13,039
in the audience or anything here um

00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:15,520
you know and then we'll sort of go

00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:18,800
through of how they feel

00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:20,000
of various you know parts of the system

00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,600
and there'll be lots of ones where they

00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,039
have sort of no strong feelings say

00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,400
whoever we're talking to doesn't work

00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:25,919
directly with them or they just they

00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,960
just don't care either way but we're

00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,319
looking for sort of

00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,160
the ones they really love and they don't

00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:32,960
want to remove

00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:34,400
or parts that they really dislike and

00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,000
it's like okay well those are prime

00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:39,199
candidates to

00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,919
switch up then um and then we'll usually

00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,919
do a third

00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,919
option which is uh

00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,639
you know how much do they have to keep

00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,440
these or you know what's the sort of

00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:53,840
internal resistance or desire to switch

00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,120
these

00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,880
because oftentimes we'll have something

00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:59,520
that we would love to replace

00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:01,280
but there's just absolutely no business

00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:04,880
um

00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:06,639
uh interest in moving those

00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,160
so you know it might just be they've

00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:09,599
just transitioned to it or

00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,120
there's a whole other department that

00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:11,919
uses it and they don't want to get rid

00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:15,039
of it

00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:16,080
you know or just you know the transition

00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:17,599
to it is going to be so

00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,360
difficult that they can't do it as part

00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:21,840
of this uh

00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,840
project

00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:26,560
uh and so we'll kind of go through

00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,319
theirs and so we'll go okay

00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,160
we have identified that magento they

00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,680
actually need to replace it say in this

00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,000
case they're using you know a magento

00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,479
one

00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,240
it's end of life now and they want to be

00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:40,000
moving to something else but it's not

00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:41,599
necessarily uh you know magento two

00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,400
maybe it's something else

00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:46,160
um you know and then things like okay

00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,000
netsuite we say we basically have to

00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,840
keep that

00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,280
you know we need to add a cms that's

00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:56,160
probably why they're talking to us

00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:58,479
uh to begin with um we're gonna

00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,080
you know bring that one in and then we

00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:01,919
say okay they have no desire for

00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,599
an lms say so we're gonna we're not

00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:05,759
gonna worry about that at all

00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:07,280
at all you know they don't care about

00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:08,720
oauth

00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,479
et cetera this is actually sort of a

00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,080
bigger even grosser spreadsheet that i

00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:13,759
use uh normally but

00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,520
you know i've simplified it in here to

00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:19,360
fit in this uh slide

00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:21,280
so um this is kind of what we end up we

00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,960
end up with their sort of opinions

00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:25,680
on some of these stuff and then we'll

00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:29,280
usually try to get

00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:32,000
uh technical uh

00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:33,919
map from them of some sort you know some

00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,399
sort of architecture map or something

00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:37,760
these will basically a hundred percent

00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:40,560
of the time be

00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,839
of low quality uh usually they are

00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:45,279
either done

00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:48,480
hurriedly to pass them off to us or they

00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:51,600
were done five years ago um

00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:54,160
they're semi inaccurate and someone's

00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,959
maybe quickly gone and deleted you know

00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,519
all the nice

00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:58,959
or all the parts that don't uh fit

00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:00,720
anymore

00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:02,880
and so we'll get some sort of crude flow

00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:05,120
like this but it usually contains

00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,720
some sort of a useful piece of

00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:10,080
information if you'll see

00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:11,839
there's this mysql section in here um

00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,839
and this is this is pretty much stolen

00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:15,680
from a an actual client

00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:17,040
uh thing so i'm not just making this up

00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,279
and you'll go okay why

00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,080
why no one mentioned you know mysql as

00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:21,760
one of this

00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,959
directly as one of the systems being

00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,160
used and it'll turn out there's

00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:26,080
something like

00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:28,240
you know the products are pushed from

00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:30,160
netsuite into a mysql database

00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,800
and then magento and elasticsearch are

00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,600
both connecting into mysql and so we'll

00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,720
have this

00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:38,080
kind of hidden sort of dependency in

00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,160
here that we actually

00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:42,160
uh have to care about and then we'll

00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,760
also learn what stuff sort of is and

00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,640
isn't connected like we have salesforce

00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,279
and mailchimp

00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,880
they're not connected to uh anything at

00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:51,680
all here

00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,480
and so we'll sort of get this kind of

00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:55,680
so-so

00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:58,000
technical uh mapping here

00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:59,279
and we'll say okay you know usually the

00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,440
first step we'll do is we'll actually

00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:05,440
clean up sort of their existing one

00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:07,200
um and try to uh get a good

00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,640
feel of what is actually happening sort

00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,920
of how data's flowing if we have

00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,440
anything missing

00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,440
uh so for example in here we'll notice

00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:17,120
that we have magento

00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:20,480
uh and elasticsearch but we

00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:23,600
there's no way that they um

00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,959
connect or that how does a user access

00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,760
this right are they are they just

00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:28,480
sending

00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:30,240
you know api queries directly to

00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,839
elasticsearch to get information

00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,680
you know that's obviously not happening

00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:36,560
so we're clearly missing

00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:37,200
uh something in here so usually we will

00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,800
uh

00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,640
go through and clean it up a little bit

00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,880
also apologies in advance for the colors

00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:45,440
i made them extra garish so

00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:48,160
uh they could be seen hopefully really

00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:50,399
easily on slides for people

00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,839
i didn't let our creative director go in

00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:53,920
and clean them up to be something more

00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:55,600
palatable

00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,120
um but so we'll actually figure out that

00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:00,480
maybe they have some sort of

00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:02,240
you know simple html javascript

00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,920
uh front end that's somewhat that's sort

00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,839
of static that someone's put in front of

00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,680
elasticsearch that is meant to sort of

00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:09,920
look like it's part of magento

00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:11,279
you know an nginx is is pushing off to

00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,160
these and so we'll figure out these

00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:14,000
different little

00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:16,079
quirks hopefully as as we sort of go

00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,279
along anytime we identify an area that

00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:20,240
looks like

00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:22,000
um you know it's missing or there's

00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,600
there's something that won't work right

00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,680
or something like that

00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,640
um we don't normally include stuff like

00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,079
nginx

00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,519
on these maps because it's usually

00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:31,519
pretty straightforward but in this case

00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:33,839
it sort of matters for how this

00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:35,839
uh flow is done so we will include that

00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:37,920
same times as we will sometimes you know

00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:39,760
put databases directly or something if

00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,640
if they have a direct connection like

00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,240
this

00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:44,560
um we've given this some little color

00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:47,200
coding to show sort of what business

00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:49,920
units interact with which parts um for

00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,839
us that's actually pretty important

00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,120
because it usually means who we're going

00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:56,959
to have to talk to

00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:58,399
with the client to get approval to do

00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:01,360
various things or to get

00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:03,519
um you know feedback on whether an

00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:05,360
integration is going to work correctly

00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:06,880
uh that kind of thing and the clients

00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,720
will not always be

00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:10,720
uh super good at doing that on their end

00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,000
ideally they they coordinate everything

00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:14,079
on on

00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,519
the sort of their side of things and we

00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:18,480
just interface with you know

00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:20,240
uh you know one primary product owner or

00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,680
something but that's rarely the case so

00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,279
we sort of have to be like hey

00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,880
you know this is sales did you talk to

00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:27,040
anyone in sales can we talk to someone

00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:29,600
in sales directly you know a head of

00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:30,320
sales a vp of sales something like that

00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,160
um

00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,839
you know same with sort of marketing and

00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,040
other things so we sort of split this up

00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:36,480
and we realized that

00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:40,000
there's actually a whole bunch of stuff

00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,000
here that's maintained by it

00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:45,120
and there's also uh in this netsuite

00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,720
part

00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,880
it's run by sort of some of the business

00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,560
divisions and also by customer service

00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:53,200
so there's kind of overlap

00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:54,320
for how it's handled here so that's

00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,839
something we're kind of going to have to

00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,959
be extra

00:12:55,839 --> 00:13:00,079
careful about is okay you know there's

00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:01,600
two

00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:02,800
whole groups that we have to worry about

00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,160
this piece of software and that's

00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,600
actually pretty common i i sort of

00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,279
simplified this a little but

00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,880
you know you might have two three

00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:09,760
different people all sort of interacting

00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,480
with one

00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:14,240
set up so now that we've sort of cleaned

00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,680
up this map a little bit

00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,360
what we're going to do is we're going to

00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:19,680
kind of go back uh

00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:21,200
to this list and we're kind of gonna

00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:25,600
make up a new

00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:28,480
version so we're gonna say okay what can

00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,600
what are we removing um and sort of what

00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:32,079
are we changing

00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,279
around here uh so obviously we're

00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:35,519
getting rid of magento

00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:37,200
we already knew that in this case maybe

00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:38,639
we've identified we're going to replace

00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,680
it with drupal commerce

00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:44,800
um we're you know fairly uh

00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:46,399
slanted bias towards drupal so you know

00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,839
we might recommend something like drupal

00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:49,040
commerce here you know we in different

00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:51,199
instances we might

00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:52,800
uh recommend a sas platform or something

00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:56,240
like that as well

00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:57,760
um and then we've also will maybe do

00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,519
a bit of a change like you see here i've

00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:01,199
actually put drupal in for the products

00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:02,720
next to netsuite even though netsuite

00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:05,920
was listed as

00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:07,199
you know uh cannot get rid of kind of

00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:09,600
thing but once we looked at the

00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:13,199
architecture we actually saw that

00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:14,240
um we weren't really using netsuite

00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:15,600
we were sort of using it for the

00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:18,240
products but we were actually using this

00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,360
sort of intermediate mysql database

00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,360
so you know this might be a thing where

00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:25,680
we go back and forth with the client

00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:28,000
we talk about um

00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:29,279
you know what they need for products

00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,600
maybe this is the case where they you

00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:31,440
know

00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,800
with adding cms functionality they

00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,880
really want sort of really rich

00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:37,839
products so they want you know lots of

00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:41,120
media you know lots of

00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:43,279
you know fancy custom

00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,880
uh layouts that kind of thing for them

00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:46,399
you know maybe paragraphs will be a good

00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,320
choice or something like that for them

00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:50,480
to build you know really rich pages

00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,600
we sort of use the example sometimes you

00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,519
know do you want like a

00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,959
a product page like amazon has you know

00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:55,920
would you want a product page you know

00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:57,600
like an iphone

00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,040
product page looks like or something

00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,480
like that you know where

00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,079
it doesn't even look like you know it's

00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,160
a big long uh

00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:05,519
page you know with text and lots of hero

00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,959
images and banners and

00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:08,480
you know things like that as you go

00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:10,000
through and it's really in-depth to sell

00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,760
sort of a single product

00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,440
you know versus something that's generic

00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,160
to every kind of product and so maybe

00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,240
we're adding

00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,839
that type of flexibility in which case

00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:20,720
drupal will be really good and

00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:22,000
just using um something that's a

00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,240
straight sort of

00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,839
uh product management tool you know a

00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,320
netsuite or even a magento or something

00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:28,240
like that

00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,839
isn't going to be able to handle that so

00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,959
we say hey you know let's switch in

00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:32,480
drupal there

00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:34,240
we're going to keep elasticsearch we

00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,839
have you know no complaints they seem to

00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:38,839
like it we have nothing against it it'll

00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:42,320
work easily with drupal search api

00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:44,720
um and then we say

00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,320
for the oms part that was sort of being

00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,079
handled by netsuite anyways

00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:50,399
you know for order management uh

00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:53,440
apologies for all the acronyms

00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:55,680
um and we're gonna actually

00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,880
just go to using netsuite for that so

00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:59,199
we're going to we're definitely keeping

00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:01,519
netsuite but we're just sort of changing

00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:03,120
what it does a little bit and lms and

00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:04,560
say authentication we're not changing

00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,720
authentication things like single

00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:10,160
sign-on oauth something like that

00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:11,920
we're not going to change those so

00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:13,519
what that means is we're going to come

00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:17,920
up with a

00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:22,079
new sort of mapping here

00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:26,399
so we're going to try to simplify things

00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:30,000
uh first off and then we're also um

00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:31,839
gonna try to uh connect

00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,279
you know things together as nicely as

00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:34,800
possible so

00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:36,399
uh this is maybe a little a little bit

00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:38,800
sort of uh

00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:40,000
you know can for the demo to look maybe

00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,839
a little nicer than we always

00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,160
uh will end up getting an architecture

00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:45,279
to look but this is kind of the idea so

00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,600
what we're going to do is we're going to

00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:49,440
get rid of that little bit of static

00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,040
you know html that we had up here with

00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:53,040
elasticsearch we're going to pipe

00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:55,120
elasticsearch right into drupal

00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:57,199
that also allows us to get rid of that

00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,480
sort of nasty little mysql database that

00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:59,839
was floating around

00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,680
so we can go back and forth between

00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:03,600
elasticsearch here pushing products

00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:05,600
you know or indexing products with it

00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:10,400
and then getting search results

00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:13,039
uh out of it um we are going to

00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:15,280
hook up uh analytics into drupal just

00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:17,520
like they were hooked up into magento

00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:18,640
uh you know we'll maybe hook salesforce

00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:21,120
in to sync

00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,160
you know customer you know names and

00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:23,919
emails

00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,760
in this case um and then we're gonna

00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:27,360
hook mailchimp into drupal again that's

00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:29,520
an easy thing you know drupal has a good

00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:33,039
mailchimp integration just for

00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:36,880
uh you know newsletter sign up

00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:38,720
uh you know and uh unsubscribe

00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:40,080
simple stuff but it gets you know

00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:42,480
everything integrated and

00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:43,760
uh working a little bit more together uh

00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,799
and then we're gonna sort of show what

00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:48,240
we're gonna have

00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:50,480
for data moving between

00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,480
netsuite and drupal and so since we're

00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,919
actually storing products in drupal

00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,240
drupal's going to be the main source

00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,440
there

00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,240
although we are going to have to push

00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:01,280
the products down to netsuite

00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:02,960
so that people managing orders uh have

00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,000
access to products and pricing although

00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,760
that would be simple we're not going to

00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,720
push all the media or anything we're

00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:09,919
just going to push

00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:12,000
you know pricing um you know

00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:14,640
title description sku or something like

00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,080
that and this is not like a hard and

00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,600
fast rule that we'd always do maybe that

00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:19,039
will come from netsuite you know maybe

00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,400
that would come from something else but

00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:23,039
in this example we'll push it from

00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,480
drupal um

00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:26,160
and then orders are actually going to go

00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,280
both ways is maybe how we'll come up

00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,440
with here so

00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:31,360
we do something like orders will come

00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,960
into drupal they'll go through once they

00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:35,840
complete checkout

00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:37,200
um they will go down uh they will push

00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:39,200
to netsuite

00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,640
and then drupal basically stops being

00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,080
able to change orders

00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,919
at that point and all the changes from

00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,600
that onwards happen from netsuite

00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:47,919
and any changes are pushed back up to

00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:49,840
drupal purely for read-only information

00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:50,799
so say a customer can log in see their

00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,880
account

00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:54,400
um and see what the status of their

00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,799
order see if a tracking number has been

00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,280
added

00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:58,720
you know that kind of thing and that you

00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,440
know something like that would let us

00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:02,240
keep the

00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:04,080
you know the two-way sync as simple as

00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:06,320
possible two asyncs are sort of

00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:07,200
always a little bit of the devil because

00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:09,919
you know

00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,039
if they you know something gets changed

00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:13,520
on both ends

00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:14,799
you know what happens what takes over

00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,480
what do you do with the data that's

00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:17,760
going to get lost how do you notify the

00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,200
user so if we can

00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:22,160
do a pretty good split there that

00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:23,919
everything up and including checkout

00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,840
happens on the drupal side everything

00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:26,559
post checkout happens on the netsuite

00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,400
side

00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:30,240
and the other side is just sort of

00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,640
mirroring that data for

00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,919
um informational purposes or in this

00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,360
case we probably wouldn't even send the

00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:38,559
data to information or

00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:42,720
the data to netsuite until

00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:46,000
uh the checkout was complete um

00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:47,440
so that is sort of a really uh top level

00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,280
of what we would do maybe when

00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:52,640
absolutely first talking with the client

00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:54,320
um sometimes i do this stuff even in uh

00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,760
you know just in our sort of pre-sales

00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:58,480
phase we might come up with some

00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:59,520
very generalized stuff like this to sort

00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,520
of show what our plan

00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:04,960
is to the client and then it's actually

00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,960
going to go into a big

00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:09,440
technical architecture that uh we would

00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,720
do and everything uh josh miller is

00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,600
actually in the chat there he's he's

00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,440
written many big

00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:15,039
technical architectures for us i usually

00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,720
get to um

00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:18,880
pawn it off once i've done the you know

00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:20,320
the easy top level stuff

00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:22,159
but that's going to be much bigger that

00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:24,320
might be a 25-page document

00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:25,600
that's going to talk about exactly how

00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:28,000
say these orders

00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:30,080
go from drupal to netsuite and back you

00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,919
know what we're handling for products

00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:33,600
you know what's going to connect in here

00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:34,960
how much of the customer information

00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,720
we're going to pass back and forth

00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:39,280
between salesforce

00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:40,880
that kind of thing so those are going to

00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,559
have

00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:44,159
you know a lot more detail we'll

00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:45,200
probably have a couple more diagrams

00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:48,159
lots of tables

00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:50,240
all that sort of fun stuff um i might

00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:52,240
even be able to post uh afterwards uh we

00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:54,960
have some samples of sort of how those

00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:58,080
uh work that we sort of show out um and

00:20:54,960 --> 00:21:03,039
of course i'll post the slides as well

00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:04,480
um i think uh after that yeah we'll

00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:06,000
i should still have a few minutes even

00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,360
though we started a little late here i

00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,480
tried to kind of be pretty prompt on

00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:13,360
that presentation

00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:15,039
uh to answer questions and then also um

00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:16,799
i will be at our booth although not

00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:18,799
immediately after this session which i

00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:20,080
like we know before i thought took place

00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:23,440
at a different time

00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:25,680
um but i when booths are open

00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:27,679
i will be at across booth

00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:30,799
[Music]

00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:34,880
oh sorry i just saw the comment there

00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:36,480
uh brian sharp uh is trolling me he

00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,240
he is a drupal developer i've known for

00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:41,679
a very long time who uh

00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:44,400
used to work for um acro

00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:45,520
uh and of course he would troll me um

00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:48,400
just mentioned that he

00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:49,760
he uh is probably going to owe me beer

00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:52,880
again this year when he's

00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:53,200
again bad at betting at hockey um as i

00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,360
have

00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,640
uh quite the winning record against him

00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:59,280
so uh

00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:00,720
anyways uh on that note um i will be at

00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,600
the booth later today if anyone wants to

00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,919
talk to me

00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:05,440
um and uh also i'll be around you can

00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:08,880
always find me on drupal slack

00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:11,280
uh and stuff like that um and let's pop

00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:15,520
over to that qa tab

00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:17,840
uh now see what we got going here

00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:19,950
um will the slides be in the con dropbox

00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:22,400
uh they are not now

00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:24,880
[Music]

00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:26,640
but i will drop them off as well as

00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:29,919
maybe some other samples if i can

00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:32,320
um after uh this is over

00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:32,320
um

00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:36,559
less content types you create the better

00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:41,679
how do you implement this

00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:45,200
uh practically um

00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:45,200
that's a

00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:52,559
really hard question

00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:54,640
um we

00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:56,080
that it depends a lot actually say on

00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:58,320
our corporate site for example

00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:00,480
we actually use relatively few content

00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:01,919
types and we make them very flexible

00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:05,679
with paragraphs

00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:09,280
um that one probably the most depends

00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:11,440
on the sort of technical savviness of uh

00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:12,320
the client and how many sort of business

00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:15,039
divisions

00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:15,679
uh they have so how we want to split

00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:17,919
them up

00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:20,000
uh personally i sort of prefer more

00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:24,000
content types that are more specific

00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:26,720
it's a little less prone to uh

00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,400
error and so we will try to make fairly

00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:30,159
specific content types

00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,600
um that are fairly locked down with

00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:33,200
limited customization

00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:35,919
but for certain clients we will actually

00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:37,919
make very wide open ones

00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:40,000
and we will make heavy use of paragraphs

00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:42,880
or starting to become a little bit more

00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,400
layouts as well although we still lean

00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:47,760
pretty heavily on paragraphs because

00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,760
layouts isn't sort of quite there

00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:53,600
to have those be functional

00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:55,520
but it it has its own difficulties i

00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:57,120
know that's not sort of a perfect

00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:59,600
answer but that's how we try to sort of

00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:02,400
split it up

00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:03,679
things like products and stuff we try to

00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:06,240
be more specific

00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:06,240
so that

00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:11,600
if we have to be passing data back and

00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:13,039
forth through integrations and stuff

00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:16,559
we have to be a little a little more

00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:16,559
strict on how we handle that

00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:22,880
so then we'll get a little more uh

00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:24,400
inflexible there um and we'll have uh

00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:26,240
you know where say a blog article or

00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:29,039
something we could be really flexible

00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:29,520
um layout builder and paragraphs do work

00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:32,320
together

00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:33,679
um there are sort of some uh modules to

00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:36,720
sort of glue that together

00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:39,679
it is imperfect uh at best um

00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:41,600
it ends up being a little cumbersome

00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:42,799
it's more cumbersome from the ui than it

00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:45,919
actually is from

00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:47,120
a sort of programming standpoint um but

00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:49,200
it can be sort of fairly

00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:50,880
complicated as you have this sort of

00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,880
drag or you have the sort of list

00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:54,159
tables kind of view that paragraphs use

00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,200
and then you have sort of the drag and

00:24:54,159 --> 00:25:01,200
drop

00:24:55,200 --> 00:25:02,960
view that um

00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,559
layouts uses to sort of map it and it

00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:06,080
can be pretty pretty difficult for

00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:09,200
clients to understand sometimes

00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:10,799
so um let's see what else do we have for

00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,640
questions who do i cheer for vancouver

00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:14,880
canucks even though they can't even play

00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:18,320
because they all got riddled with covid

00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:22,960
and it's a big controversy right now

00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:22,960
so try not to think about that um

00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:29,039
centralized architecture for commerce

00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:32,080
could be risky what if the drupal site

00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:33,679
is slow or down

00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:35,360
what do we do for a secondary backup

00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:37,200
service um

00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:39,200
actually we don't have too many problems

00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:43,679
with that uh we're pretty good at

00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:45,039
having um uh pretty performant uh drupal

00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:48,000
sites and having that be

00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:48,720
a main hub of commerce you know we can

00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,760
take

00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:54,000
you know ten thousand orders an hour

00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:55,520
no problem uh that kind of thing i've

00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
actually done entire talks and we have

00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:58,720
lots of

00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,080
blogs posts and stuff on our sites uh

00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,039
all about drupal and commerce

00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,480
performance

00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:04,240
um you know and we can do you know we

00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:06,320
can run them through multiple you know

00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:08,000
load balance servers and and things that

00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:09,039
scale up automatically and everything

00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,640
like that so

00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:12,559
um we're actually pretty confident at

00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:15,760
having that be a big hub

00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:17,600
uh as far as e-commerce is concerned um

00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:19,520
you know like i said we don't always do

00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,799
it that way um and as we're going sort

00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,880
of more headless

00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:24,159
uh these days it's not always the case

00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:25,760
but um

00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:27,520
we're pretty good at having our drupal

00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:29,840
sites be very very

00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:31,600
uh reliable so it's it's not actually a

00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:33,919
big worry and we deal with some

00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:34,720
fairly high volume you know we do some

00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:36,480
big telecom

00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:38,000
stuff with iphone pre-orders and things

00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:42,240
like that which can be you know pretty

00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:45,440
crazy as well as sort of standard uh

00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:47,600
black fridays uh let's see

00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:49,600
if a client is willing to accept an mvp

00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:51,279
is it better to move forward on an mvp

00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:54,000
or spend time on architecture and

00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:57,039
discovery um

00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,799
if we can we prefer the mvp uh route and

00:26:57,039 --> 00:27:01,520
so we would do sort of just enough

00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:02,720
discovery and strategy to build said mvp

00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,760
and then we would kind of continue

00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:05,679
working on it

00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:07,440
as we went along so it's going to depend

00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:08,240
on the client how much of the site we

00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,400
have to

00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:12,000
replace sort of all at once oftentimes

00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,799
we're coming in and we're not the first

00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,919
build

00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:17,440
you know we're uh a build for someone

00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:19,679
that already has a lot of existing stuff

00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:21,200
so the mvp still has to be fairly large

00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:22,880
because it's replacing a fair bit of

00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:26,960
functionality

00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:29,919
which lends itself to a bit more upfront

00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,919
planning from us

00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:34,559
although if we have a site where we can

00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:36,399
do simple mvps and work from there

00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:38,320
we prefer that there's you know less

00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:39,120
risk of clients not getting what they

00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:42,880
want

00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:44,720
um that kind of thing so

00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:47,279
it's a bit of a mix and it depends a lot

00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:51,360
on budgets from clients too

00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:52,960
they'll have uh issues with um

00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:55,279
you know they might need to to get

00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:56,559
approval for a fiscal year or if we work

00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:57,840
with you know a university or a

00:27:56,559 --> 00:28:00,240
government or something like that

00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:01,840
getting budget approvals are you know

00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:03,360
really slow and cumbersome and so they

00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:04,640
might need to do this whole planning

00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:07,360
phase and so we can

00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:08,799
you know budget out kind of a whole huge

00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:10,720
chunk of a project

00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:12,480
um at once uh that said we don't

00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:13,200
actually hard quote anything these days

00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:15,360
anymore

00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,799
everything is timer materials from us

00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:19,919
but we try to still give

00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:19,919
fairly good estimates

00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:25,760
let's see next question do you get down

00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,640
to the content type

00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:29,520
level in the sales process or do you try

00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,679
to be higher level

00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:33,919
in the sales process we try to be higher

00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:34,880
level and not get down to content types

00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:37,440
we try to stick

00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:38,960
away or stay away from that um and work

00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:41,360
more with systems

00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:42,720
um you know whole systems of hey drupal

00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:44,159
will handle these

00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:46,000
you know few sections we might say like

00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:46,799
drupal will handle you know products and

00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,480
pricing or

00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:50,240
you know and blog posts or something

00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,520
like that but if products are actually

00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:53,039
made up of six different

00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:55,200
you know types of products or something

00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:56,000
like that we try to not get into that

00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:59,039
part

00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,559
um that will happen in you know a

00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:02,399
technical architecture or something that

00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:04,240
will get into that level of detail

00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:05,840
it depends a little bit on the savviness

00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:07,360
of the client if it's a very drupal

00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:10,720
savvy customer

00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:13,039
um uh

00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:14,559
then you know we might get into that a

00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:16,559
little more but mostly we'll push that

00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:18,799
sort of after sales and say hey we'll

00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:20,799
we'll handle that in planning it tends

00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:24,799
to to work pretty well

00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:28,480
um that way um

00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:30,399
uh do you ever engage in process mapping

00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:31,919
and assisting the client in changing

00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:32,880
business workflow through your mapping

00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:35,200
discovery process

00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:36,399
uh quite a bit um and it can be

00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:40,000
difficult to sort of

00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:42,720
uh stay in our lane

00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,200
a little bit there um and sort of work

00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:46,559
where

00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:48,240
we are uh skilled and

00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:50,080
stay out of where we are not if it's

00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:52,480
something like e-commerce you know order

00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:54,000
process flows and things like that

00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:55,520
we're quite experienced in that and we

00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,120
can say hey let's you know

00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:58,720
manage this here then let's you know at

00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:00,480
this point in the flow we'll push over

00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:02,480
to this process and you know maybe your

00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:04,880
csr should be involved here

00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:06,159
that kind of stuff um once it gets

00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,840
outside of that flow if it's sort of

00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:09,200
like how an accounting flow should work

00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:12,559
or something like that

00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:15,679
um we're less involved

00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:17,679
um although we kind of still end up

00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:20,240
being fairly involved with workflows you

00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:21,840
know uh there a lot so we're pretty

00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:23,360
involved in those even if it's just to

00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:25,679
sort of recommend

00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:27,120
um you know that they change something

00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:29,039
or we might have a partner that we try

00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:30,880
to get involved to help with say

00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:32,399
you know if it gets to the side of like

00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:33,760
shipping and order fulfillment that's a

00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:34,480
little outside of our wheelhouse you

00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,559
know actually

00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:38,000
managing warehouses or something and we

00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:40,080
recommend they bring in a different

00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,919
uh consultant or something there

00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:44,480
although we we do get quite

00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:45,679
uh involved in that we try to be very uh

00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:50,000
consultative

00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:52,320
so um in an ideal world what's the best

00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,880
way to sync the crm customer data with

00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:58,640
drupal users cron web hooks

00:30:54,880 --> 00:31:00,480
um etc um and how do you plan which

00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:01,919
fields need to be synced uh we plan

00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:04,240
which fields need to be synced

00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:05,679
uh in pretty great detail usually in

00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:09,039
technical architecture

00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:12,080
we try to sync the ones that um

00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:13,519
will be relevant uh and

00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,880
you know only the ones that are that

00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:16,159
they're actually going to use in the

00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:19,039
other system

00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:20,399
um and limit that and then we try to be

00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:22,000
very careful with what's going to need

00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:24,960
to change back and forth

00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,960
it can be quite difficult um to sort of

00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:29,760
map that in in a two-way

00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:31,200
uh setup um cron is probably my least

00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:34,320
favorite way of doing that

00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:36,399
um a web hooks or even uh

00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:37,919
what we prefer actually is that say if

00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:40,559
drupal um

00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:42,320
can connect to an api from say like

00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:45,120
salesforce and then

00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:46,960
uh drupal will basically do them in in

00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:48,720
near real time to push them over

00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:50,399
basically sort of asynchronously

00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:52,399
in real time so the minute they get put

00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:54,080
in um they're being pushed over to the

00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:55,200
new system but not so much that they're

00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:57,200
blocking

00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,640
um so in some cases they might have to

00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:00,320
be blocking but for the most part they

00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:01,679
don't so

00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:03,760
that's how we would try to do it is

00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:05,600
basically have a non-blocking

00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:07,279
setup so like just after say the order

00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:09,120
gets completed um

00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:11,039
then a job gets run you know triggered

00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:12,720
off of an event hook on the

00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:15,200
order completion or something like that

00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:16,960
so it can be a little fussy with php to

00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,559
make things you know asynchronous there

00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:22,159
or whatever but

00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:24,559
it's not too bad um i think we're

00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:24,559
probably

00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,159
use using up our time here but no one's

00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:31,840
kicked us out yet so

00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:33,279
i can answer at least uh one more

00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:35,279
question here um

00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:36,880
what's the average time to build a

00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:40,799
commerce site considering basic

00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:43,919
variables into consideration um

00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:45,360
we do fairly big sites you know

00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:47,279
we would do something where even a

00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:50,559
planning phase from us might be

00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:52,960
25k or something like that um

00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:54,080
you know so six months would be a pretty

00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:57,039
fast build

00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:58,399
uh for us oh we tend to not do if you

00:32:57,039 --> 00:32:59,679
just need out of the box stuff that

00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:01,279
tends to not be us

00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:03,200
you know we're usually if you need a

00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:05,200
bunch of customization

00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:07,519
um built and that's why you come from us

00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:10,640
it's you know six months to a year

00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:14,559
uh for a build process for us um

00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:17,760
and also we tend to be an ongoing uh

00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:21,440
kind of agency so 80 plus percent of our

00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:23,760
um uh work is recurring work

00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:25,120
for clients so lots of rsas and stuff

00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:26,480
like that as we're continuing to sort of

00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:27,919
tweak and improve and add new

00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:31,039
functionality and

00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:32,799
um things to existing uh

00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:35,120
commerce sites so that's what we're

00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:36,640
doing a lot of doing you know ongoing

00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:39,120
work the clients we've been working with

00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:40,799
for sort of years and years

00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:42,799
integrating to new systems tweaking

00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:44,159
integrations adding new functionality

00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:46,320
upgrading tech

00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:48,399
uh all that sort of stuff as we go along

00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:50,640
but our builds are are fairly high

00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:52,559
um that said we're looking to speed up

00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:55,600
that setup now that we're sort of uh

00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:57,039
switching to um

00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,640
as part of how we're switching to more

00:33:57,039 --> 00:34:00,960
headless setups um

00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:02,320
and we're trying to be a little uh

00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,919
leaner on how we can get

00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:05,919
parts up you know with sort of a

00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:08,079
services setup of maybe we can replace

00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:10,159
parts with microservices and a d

00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:12,800
coupled front end and that kind of thing

00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:14,720
that is very very early on

00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:17,280
in our process and we won't be building

00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:19,280
sites like that too much until probably

00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:21,359
next year

00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:22,879
i think i got all the questions if i

00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:25,040
didn't get your question

00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:26,240
uh i apologize but i'm pretty sure i was

00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:30,399
able to scan

00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:33,679
um through all of them there

00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:36,800
uh so um

00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:39,119
hopefully uh that went well

00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,119
um

00:34:39,919 --> 00:34:43,599
uh yeah um i will be at the booth later

00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,440
on

00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:46,839
um and i'm also on slack uh if anyone

00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:50,000
has any questions

00:34:46,839 --> 00:34:52,000
so uh thank you for that oh and

00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,839
