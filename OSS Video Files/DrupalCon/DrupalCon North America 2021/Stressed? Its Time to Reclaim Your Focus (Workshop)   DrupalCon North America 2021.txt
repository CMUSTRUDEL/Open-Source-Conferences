so welcome to stressed

00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,080
it's time to reclaim your focus and i

00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:19,439
thank you all for

00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,880
sharing your autobiography titles in the

00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:23,039
chat

00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,519
we're going to talk about the science of

00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:25,519
stress

00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:31,199
because you really can't rid your life

00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:33,200
of stress it's going to happen

00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:35,040
but you can change your relationship to

00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,520
stress

00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,719
so i invite you to put down your phone

00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,680
to put down your work

00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:43,120
to stop multitasking and have some paper

00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,280
nearby

00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,480
and as we're doing be open to the

00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:49,200
possibility

00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,200
of sharing

00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:57,120
so my name is dory kellner and

00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:58,879
i am the managing partner of sleight of

00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,640
hand studios

00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:02,559
we've been in the drupal community for

00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:05,760
well over a decade

00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:09,520
and my autobiography

00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,520
is going to be called she was enough

00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,000
and that is because i have suffered from

00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,840
stress

00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,640
my entire life it was anxiety

00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,600
it was depression it was burnout it was

00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,840
panic

00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:29,040
i've seen it all and

00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:33,680
most of the time it was work related

00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:37,920
i left two jobs over stress

00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:41,360
and then i decided a few years back

00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:45,680
when drupal 8 was launched

00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:48,399
and my time as a site builder and themer

00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:50,399
looked like it would require an awful

00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:52,640
lot of retraining

00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:54,000
i finally decided that i was going to

00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,040
move in the direction

00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,759
that my heart told me to go which was to

00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:01,040
become

00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:02,399
a meditation teacher so i studied at

00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:05,680
brown university

00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,680
and i have my

00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,080
certification and mindfulness-based

00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,000
stress reduction

00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:15,599
and i also have a certification in

00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:20,000
facilitating workplace mindfulness

00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:22,879
so we're going to start today

00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,319
by looking at some of the statistics

00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:26,400
about stress

00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:28,879
and then moving on into the science and

00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,920
then into some ways that you can

00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:35,519
learn to reshape

00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:39,440
your relationship to stress

00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:41,120
so in july 2020 the national bureau of

00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,560
economic relations

00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,640
published a study that was done by

00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:48,080
harvard and

00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,879
new york university over 3 million

00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,760
people

00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:53,040
21 000 companies across 16 cities in

00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,200
north america

00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,319
the middle east and europe and they were

00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,920
discussing the

00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:02,159
impact of covet 19 on the nature of work

00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,840
and we're all working longer days we're

00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:05,680
holding more meetings we're sending more

00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,400
email

00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,440
other studies of vpn data show that

00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,319
people are putting in

00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,920
extra three hours a day and working at

00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:16,720
really odd hours

00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:19,840
basically due to blurred schedules and

00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:22,080
boundaries between home and work life

00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:24,319
and then other studies like from

00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:27,440
stanford

00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:29,920
was a study of 228

00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:31,599
studies so it was a meta-analysis and it

00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,560
examined how 10 common workplace

00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:38,280
stressors affect a person's health

00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:41,840
so we're all sitting in this place of

00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,840
unbelievable stress

00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,640
and so you're in good company if you're

00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:49,519
feeling stressed right now

00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:51,599
i think i was stressed even before the

00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:54,640
pandemic

00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:57,200
but this was certainly a banner year for

00:03:54,640 --> 00:04:00,239
my stress levels

00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:03,360
so you could see that stress results in

00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:05,680
death that's comparable to

00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,120
heart disease and accidents it's like

00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:10,640
the fourth and fifth

00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:12,959
largest causes of death so what i'd like

00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:16,720
to do to start

00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:19,440
is for us to examine our own

00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:21,359
place right now where where are we

00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:24,080
sitting

00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:24,560
so i'm going to ask everyone invite you

00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,199
all

00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,080
to come into a comfortable posture in

00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:31,120
your seat for

00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,120
just a few moments

00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:39,440
so posture that's both at ease

00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,720
and also dignified when you keep your

00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:43,199
back straight

00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,080
you bring strength into your body which

00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:47,199
is really

00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:49,199
helpful against stress

00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:52,080
and you can keep your eyes open or you

00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:53,919
can close them if you'd like

00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:57,840
and begin to notice the thoughts that

00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:57,840
are swirling around in your mind

00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:05,759
and be very specific what are you

00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,759
thinking about

00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:11,840
where is your mind going

00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:25,840
how are you mentally feeling

00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,840
now let's move to what you're

00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:43,440
experiencing

00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,440
right now in your heart

00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:48,880
what specific feelings can you label

00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:54,560
what is your general mood

00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:01,759
and use words of emotion like joy

00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:07,840
or peace or discomfort

00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:07,840
fear frustration exhaustion

00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:28,560
and now notice what you're experiencing

00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,560
in your body

00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,479
your posture

00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,560
your senses

00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:46,560
sights sounds tastes

00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:46,560
point of contact with the chair or the

00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,840
floor

00:06:53,199 --> 00:07:00,479
maybe scan your body from your feet

00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,479
your legs

00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:06,240
your hips torso

00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:11,840
arms hands

00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:19,599
neck

00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,599
head

00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:31,840
what are you noticing right now

00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:45,840
i invite you to take a couple of breaths

00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:51,280
and if your eyes were closed you can

00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:54,319
open them now

00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:58,080
and i'd like everyone to switch over

00:07:54,319 --> 00:08:01,280
to the poll tab then button

00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:03,840
right next to chat

00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:07,199
and you're going to see a poll there

00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:10,400
what is your level of stress

00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:12,800
there are five options

00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:14,400
now that you're in touch with how what

00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,879
you're thinking

00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:19,360
what you're feeling and the state of

00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:19,360
your body

00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:25,120
choose one of the options for your

00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,120
stress level

00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:33,120
i'm great doing okay

00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:36,000
i've been better pretty bad

00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,000
or distressed

00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:39,680
i'll give everybody a moment to put in

00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:41,919
their answers

00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:45,360
i don't know how to figure out that

00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:45,360
people have put in answers

00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:55,839
so we'll just give this a try

00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:13,360
and michael i don't see any results

00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:22,480
dory do you see him now do you see the

show results i see

00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,080
a show results button and when i click

00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:34,399
it nothing happens

00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:34,399
i just clicked it and i'm seeing them so

00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,839
can you share that with us please so

00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:40,640
there's got

00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:42,399
one vote for i'm great 13 votes for

00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:46,320

00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:47,680
20 votes for i've been better 13 votes

00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:51,760
for pretty bad

00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:55,040
and one vote for distressed

00:09:51,760 --> 00:10:05,839
well that's a perfect bell curve thanks

00:09:55,040 --> 00:10:05,839
michael for your help with that

00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:14,000
so this is

00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:18,000
the guidance um that we can provide

00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:21,040
for stress levels you know if you're

00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,079
feeling great or you're okay then you're

00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,160
at a low stress

00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:26,320
level and you pretty much have some good

00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:29,360
coping techniques

00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:31,440
if you've been better maybe your radar

00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:33,120
can go up a little bit

00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,720
you're maybe findings that some things

00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,880
are a little more difficult than they've

00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:39,040
been in the past

00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:40,800
but if your stress is bad or you feel

00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:43,600
distressed right now

00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:46,640
maybe you're tending to avoid things

00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:50,160
maybe you're shut down

00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:51,519
you really aren't functioning optimally

00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,760
and certainly if you're in the

00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:56,959
distressed state

00:10:53,760 --> 00:11:00,079
i recommend reaching out

00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:01,839
to somebody for guidance and help the

00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:03,040
things that we're going to talk about

00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:05,360
today are not

00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,640
a substitute for any mental health

00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:09,839
support

00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:12,560
they are in addition to

00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:15,040
and they align very beautifully with a

00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:18,399
lot of mental health counselors

00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:20,240
provide to their clients

00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:23,839
let's start by talking about what is

00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:24,320
stress so a stress is a reaction to any

00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:27,760
type

00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:30,800
of real or perceived threat or demand

00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:32,560
so notice it says real or perceived so

00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:35,760
that means anything that's a

00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:37,680
physical threat to you or

00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:40,160
perhaps an emotional threat a

00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:42,800
psychological threat

00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:44,640
these are all causes of stress it could

00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,640
be illness as well

00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:48,880
it could be longer short term it could

00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:52,399
be minor major or extreme as

00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:53,040
extremely difficult to measure there are

00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:55,680
very

00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:57,519
few ways that we have to measure a

00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:59,760
person's level of stress

00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:02,639
other than the self-reporting that you

00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:05,600
all just did with the poll

00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:06,639
so you might have personal stress so

00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,839
illness

00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:10,720
a loss of relationship some financial

00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:14,720
stress you might have

00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:17,600
a family stress a marriage and divorce

00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:19,600
issues with children moving your home or

00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:23,200
death in the family

00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:28,079
it might be work stress a job

00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:31,519
a new job a boss some bias

00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:33,519
the workload unemployment or there might

00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:35,120
be environmental stress

00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:37,600
we're all experiencing that now

00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:42,800
technology political stress

00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:47,200
natural disasters the pandemic obviously

00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:50,240
so let's say

00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:54,079
what this is what is this to you

00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:56,639
this is instinctual fear in the chat

00:12:54,079 --> 00:13:07,839
type in what you would do if you saw

00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:07,839
this tiger coming at you

00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:17,519
marsha says scream and run

00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:18,839
sarah says freeze and then run when the

00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:24,399
adrenaline hit

00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:27,839
right make yourself small and protected

00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:28,639
thank you larry take a photo freeze or

00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:32,399
run away

00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:33,200
freeze panic yes this is our survival

00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:37,279
instinct

00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:40,320
kicking in survival instinct is designed

00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:44,160
to protect us from physical threat

00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:46,399
and we can see that in the brain

00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,519
so we're being protected from physical

00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:50,800
harm

00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:53,920
and the part of the brain that

00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,320
manages that for us is the amygdala so

00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,959
this

00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:58,720
is the part of the brain that is our

00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:01,199
primitive brain

00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,399
and what it does is it kicks in the

00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:04,800
adrenals

00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:07,040
so we get our cortisol our blood

00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,800
pressure goes up our post goes up and we

00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:11,680
get that tendency

00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,320
which we call fight flight freeze tender

00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:15,440
bef

00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:19,199
befriend so we actually

00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,199
feel this happening to us

00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,720
so yeah maybe some of us can outrun a

00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:26,079
tiger

00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:30,560
but mostly we're going to run away

00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:33,920
and we're going to feel this in our body

00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:35,920
so now in the chat tell me

00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:45,839
you've been you're engaged with this

00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:45,839
tiger where do you feel it in your body

00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,959
stomach legs

00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:58,000
chest everywhere in your gut

00:14:54,880 --> 00:15:01,839
in your spine chest and stomach

00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:03,199
yeah so this is an actual physiological

00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:06,560
reaction

00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:10,959
to our stress our pupils dilate

00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:13,600
the mouth gets dry the muscles tense

00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:15,680
we start to sweat our palms get sweaty

00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:18,240
our body gets sweaty

00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:19,680
um the heart starts to race our breath

00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,440
is faster

00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:25,279
our blood pressure goes up and our

00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:28,399
digestion completely shuts down

00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:31,360
okay so that's why

00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:32,880
we start we want to engage with how our

00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:36,000
body feels

00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:36,800
the reality is your body feels these

00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,839
reactions

00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:42,240
before your brain kicks in so the better

00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:44,720
connection we have with our bodies

00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:48,399
the quicker we can find that response

00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,399
and understand what's going on

00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:54,560
so now there are

00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,360
other things that trigger us besides a

00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:57,920
physical

00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,560
reaction right so we had a physical

00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:01,600
threat

00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:02,880
tiger came at us we froze we ran our

00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,480
heart raced

00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:06,000
but there are emotional and

00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:09,600
psychological

00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:12,639
pain that cause real

00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:14,000
fear we really feel like we're in grave

00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:15,519
danger

00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,519
a lot of people get that like just from

00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:19,759
public speaking

00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:21,199
people who don't want to submit a

00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:23,839
session to drupalcon

00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:24,800
because there's intense fear of public

00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:27,519
speaking

00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,399
and the same thing happens your palms

00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:31,680
get sweaty

00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:33,759
your shoulders get tight right so which

00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:37,600
one of these

00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:41,199
identity fears resonates with you

00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,199
you can put that into the chat

00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:45,759
and think about how do we keep these

00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:47,839
fears from holding us back

00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:51,839
so that they don't create so much stress

00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:51,839
in our lives

00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:02,959
so there's that loss of freedom that

00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,959
fear of being judged

00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:07,600
getting hurt feeling inadequate

00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:19,839
you know that imposter syndrome

00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:24,720
yeah something bad happening change

00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:28,000
rejection inadequacy

00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:31,840
all of them inadequacy failure

00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:36,240
uncertainty something bad happening

00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:36,240
yeah these are real

00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:41,840
severe fomo which stresses me out

00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:44,720
absolutely

00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:45,360
and it's hard to choose and these are

00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,640
real

00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:53,039
and our bodies respond

00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:58,320
as if they are physical threats

00:17:53,039 --> 00:18:02,960
right so here is that amygdala again

00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:06,320
seeing this type of innate fear in us

00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:09,840
these psychological and emotional fears

00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,840
and it's going to trigger

00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:14,080
now when it triggers the part of the

00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:16,080
brain

00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:18,000
that is actually supposed to help you

00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:20,880
through this

00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,080
goes offline and that's your prefrontal

00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,240
cortex

00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:26,400
your prefrontal cortex is the center for

00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:28,720
problem solving it is where all your

00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,960
critical thinking happens

00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,240
but what's happening in your brain is

00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,880
yet your amygdala

00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:37,039
is shutting off the prefrontal cortex

00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,960
it's also shutting off the hippocampus

00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:42,720
which is your memory center

00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:44,960
so the primitive brain is hijacking

00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,240
all your higher level functions your

00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,520
brain shuts down

00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:50,080
and you can't think your way out of

00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,559
problems you can't empathize with

00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:53,360
yourself

00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:54,320
you can't understand where other people

00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,160
are coming from

00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:58,960
and we're basically stuck in this

00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:02,799
autopilot situation

00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:04,720
okay everything shuts down

00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:06,160
and this has happened to me over and

00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:08,720
over and over again

00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,360
and the key to this is how do we bring

00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:13,039
the brain

00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:13,360
back online because we really don't need

00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:16,480
a

00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:18,240
fight flight free syndrome when we are

00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,360
confronted with these emotional

00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:22,160
challenges

00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:25,600
what we need to do is think our way out

00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:30,240
of them

00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:34,720
so when we have a stressor

00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:37,039
it kicks off your stress baseline

00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:39,120
so here's that tiger now let's pretend

00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:42,400
the tiger is approaching a zebra

00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:45,200
the zebra is merrily eating his grass

00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,679
enjoying his day in the sunshine looks

00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:50,400
up

00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:50,400
here comes the tiger zebra takes off

00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:55,120
he doesn't think about taking off the

00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:58,559
amygdala tells him

00:19:55,120 --> 00:20:01,520
time to run and he runs and when he

00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:04,400
outruns that tiger

00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:07,039
he does what we've seen all our pets do

00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:09,360
he stops and shakes

00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:10,480
he's shaking out all the adrenaline he's

00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:13,520
shaking out all the

00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:14,240
cortisol from his body and then he goes

00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:19,840
back

00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:22,640
to eating well we don't do that

00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:25,120
because we have higher brain function

00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:28,720
what we tend to do

00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:32,080
is hold on to our stress so we have

00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:34,320
that initial stressor and then

00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:35,760
we don't go back down to our baseline we

00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:39,360
don't shake it off

00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:41,039
we hold on to it we say oh i should have

00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:43,760
done that differently

00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:46,400
well what if that happens again and we

00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:48,799
raise our stress level a little bit

00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,840
and then we hit another stressor and we

00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:52,320
do the same thing

00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:53,919
and we continuously raise our stress

00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:56,960
level

00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:58,240
so what's happening is that our adrenals

00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,000
kick in

00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:02,559
the cortisol goes up the blood pressure

00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
goes up the pulse goes up

00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:06,480
and our perception is that we're in

00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,880
danger so we hit fight flight freeze

00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:12,240
right there

00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:15,440
and when we do this on a chronic basis

00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:18,440
over and over again we

00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:19,840
start to experience high blood pressure

00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:23,120
hyperarousal

00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:25,760
headaches back aches sleep disorder

00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:28,799
anxiety depression

00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:32,559
and in order to overcome those things

00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:35,440
we overwork we over eat

00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:36,080
we get angry a lot substance abuse

00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,480
gambling

00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:40,159
all sorts of self-destructive behaviors

00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:42,720
start kicking in

00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:45,360
and if we let that go too long we

00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:48,080
ultimately end up in breakdown

00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:50,320
this is when we're exhausted we have a

00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:51,600
complete loss of drive and apathy

00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:54,720
towards our work

00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:56,400
we feel alienated we feel depressed and

00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:59,840
literally disease

00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,840
can come into play here

00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:07,280
so your perception and your behavior are

00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:10,080
guided by these

00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:11,840
mental models in your mind okay this is

00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:14,080
a thought process that you use to

00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:15,039
examine a problem or make sense of

00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:17,200
things

00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:18,400
so you try to apply your mental model to

00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:21,200
every situation

00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:22,640
and you become very limited so let's

00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,799
give an example here

00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:26,720
somebody came to me who was offered a

00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:28,000
vice presidency job

00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:30,480
and they thought they weren't good

00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,880
enough they said

00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:34,880
they're not ready for that even after

00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36,880
over 10 years in the workplace they said

00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:39,919
they weren't ready for that

00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,799
instead of grabbing this opportunity for

00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:42,480
growth

00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:44,240
so we've built these models over our

00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,440
lifetime and we're constantly telling

00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:48,080
ourselves

00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:49,280
you know we're not good enough or we're

00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:52,880
too busy

00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:56,240
or that's not for me and we really

00:22:52,880 --> 00:23:00,640
end up becoming stuck and on autopilot

00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:00,640
and we allow our brains to shut down

00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:05,440
so the thing that brings our brain back

00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:08,720
online

00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:12,320
is simply awareness and

00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:13,520
awareness is actually a synonym for

00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:15,280
mindfulness

00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:17,440
i know we're throwing the term

00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:19,600
mindfulness around a lot these days

00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:22,480
you're seeing it a lot in the news

00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:23,200
people are considering it a fad but 40

00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:26,000
years ago

00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:28,159
john kabat-zinn created a program called

00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:31,039
mindfulness-based stress reduction

00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:31,840
and he defined mindfulness as paying

00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:34,960
attention

00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:38,320
on purpose in the present moment

00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:42,000
and without any judgment and

00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:43,919
after over 40 years now this was in 1979

00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:47,039
so over 40 years ago

00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:51,520
we have enough data to know

00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:54,559
that this type of awareness in the brain

00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:56,960
allows us to take our control back it

00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:59,200
helps us get out of autopilot

00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:00,880
and it allows you to discern what you're

00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:04,240
feeling in the moment

00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:07,760
without discounting your needs

00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:09,919
by accepting a situation for what it is

00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:11,520
by understanding that other people might

00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:14,559
have a different perspective

00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:16,720
and maybe limiting our judgment of them

00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:20,000
and of ourselves

00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:22,799
so what awareness does is

00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:25,520
it turns on the connection between the

00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:27,919
amygdala and the prefrontal cortex

00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:29,679
and the amygdala and the hypoth and the

00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:32,799
hippocampus

00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:33,600
so that when the amygdala triggers and

00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:36,559
says

00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:37,520
we're in danger here the other parts of

00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:40,080
your brain can

00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:42,480
bring you back and say wait a minute

00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:45,840
this isn't physical danger

00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:46,640
what other way can i respond to this

00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:49,760
okay

00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:51,440
so i know we all have that situation

00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:55,360
where somebody comes at us

00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:58,880
with a request or a desire or an opinion

00:24:55,360 --> 00:25:01,919
that we don't like and oftentimes

00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:04,960
our reaction is simply to

00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:08,799
argue with them get angry

00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:10,240
get hurt and instead can we turn on our

00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:12,799
minds

00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,679
and come up with a more effective way of

00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:16,720
dealing

00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:16,720
with what's going on

00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:23,919
so that will shut off the amygdala

00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,919
at the right time

00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:29,679
so we have this merry-go-round of life

00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:32,240
right and we're trying to jump off our

00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:35,200
minds are racing we're busy

00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:37,200
and there are three ways to get off

00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:40,640
which are also the three doors

00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:42,159
that can get you into awareness so you

00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:45,279
want to catch yourself

00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:47,360
before you react the way you always have

00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:50,000
okay so instead of jumping at somebody

00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:52,880
who asks you for a favor

00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:55,039
we want to take a breath and go okay how

00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:57,520
am i feeling right now

00:25:55,039 --> 00:26:00,480
getting out of that autopilot reaction

00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:04,000
is going to help lower your stress

00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:05,679
so the first thing to do is be aware

00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,159
that all those thoughts running around

00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:12,159
in your head they're not really facts

00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:14,159
they're stories this is physiologically

00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:16,400
how our brain works

00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:18,559
it just sees what's around it and then

00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:20,880
starts creating all these thoughts that

00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:22,640
come racing into your mind

00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,080
so we're going to do a visualization

00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:28,480
right now

00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:30,080
so imagine that you were just received a

00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:33,520
new assignment

00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:33,520
and your plate is full

00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:37,600
you're also concerned that maybe you

00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:38,480
don't really have all the skills you

00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:41,679
need

00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,679
to do that assignment

00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:49,760
where in your body are you feeling this

00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:50,559
what fears are being triggered and what

00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:54,159
are you thinking

00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:55,679
and feeling and if you don't you know

00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:59,200
you can put this in the chat

00:26:55,679 --> 00:27:01,200
if you'd like to come on on the stage

00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,240
and talk about what you're thinking on

00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:06,720
this

00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:09,440
love to have you join on stage as well

00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,880
so a new assignment it's a lot of work

00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:13,919
you're not really sure

00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:21,840
if you know how to do it

00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:21,840
what are you thinking and feeling

00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:30,880
feel it in the chest and throat

00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:35,840
thank you kelly

00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:52,080
does anybody have a fear of saying no

00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:52,080
ah larry feels it in the gut

00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:55,840
yeah fear saying no maybe a fear of

00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:03,840
looking

00:27:55,840 --> 00:28:03,840
silly that you or looking stupid

00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:10,399
can't say no fear of doubt avoidance

00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:13,279
definitely a fear saying no

00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:14,080
my mind is racing i feel it in my entire

00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:17,679
viscera

00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:20,960
and i want to just and i and i wanted to

00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:21,919
just exhale a lot all the time fear of

00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:25,520
failure

00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:29,039
right so all these fears just freeze us

00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:29,039
up and we can't say no

00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:34,640
so what if we could what if we could

00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:37,039
learn to say no

00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:40,799
so here is the stress response that

00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:40,799
everybody's going through right now

00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:48,240
okay

00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:50,080
and here is a different way to look at

00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:52,000
it

00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:55,200
so of course we still have that

00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:59,440
physiological response

00:28:55,200 --> 00:29:03,279
right but our next perception is very

00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:06,480
similar to the first exercise we did

00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:12,240
right so becoming aware

00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:15,760
where is my mind where is my heart

00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:15,760
what is my body telling me

00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:27,120
just that one pause

00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:29,679
allows us to turn on the prefrontal

00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:32,880
cortex

00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:34,080
just bringing that awareness into the

00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:38,000
mind

00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:41,039
into the body and into the heart

00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:45,120
gives us the opportunity to reframe

00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:45,120
and say what do i need right now

00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:53,039
to be able to assess

00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:56,240
the options and strategies access this

00:29:53,039 --> 00:30:00,720
with from with inside ourselves

00:29:56,240 --> 00:30:02,799
and instead of building up stress

00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:05,840
we start reaching for more positive

00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:05,840
coping techniques

00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,559
and what all of this ultimately brings

00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:14,159
us to instead of breakdown

00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:17,120
is resilience where we can come up with

00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:18,799
problem focused strategies we can

00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:22,080
recover our equilibrium

00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:24,159
our comments our balance of mind

00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:25,919
and determine what are we going to do

00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:29,039
with this situation

00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:30,480
that has us so inflamed

00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:32,559
and we're going to talk about this a

00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:35,840
little bit more in detail

00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:37,919
a little later in the session

00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:38,960
before you're able to change your

00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:42,240
behavior you

00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:45,039
actually need to do some inner work

00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:45,039
you need to

00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:50,000
consider whether a mindfulness practice

00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:52,240
is going to be helpful

00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,080
in your life and what mindfulness

00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:57,360
practice does it makes you more aware

00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:59,200
and present there are three types of

00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:02,159
mindfulness practices

00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:02,799
there's meditation there is mindful

00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:05,919
walking

00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:08,000
where you literally walk nowhere

00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:09,840
and there's mindful movement so if

00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,559
you're doing yoga or qigong

00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:13,440
or tai chi you're already there with

00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:16,320
that one and you

00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:18,320
understand how the mind-body connection

00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:21,440
is really supported

00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:23,840
by a mindful movement practice

00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:24,640
meditation practice unlike what most

00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:27,440
people think

00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:29,760
is not about clearing your mind and it's

00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:33,200
not about relaxing

00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:36,080
you literally just have

00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:36,720
an anchor so you either use your breath

00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:39,200
or

00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:41,279
your body sensations or you could even

00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:43,279
use sound or sight

00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:45,039
and every time your mind starts to

00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:48,720
wander and spin off

00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:51,200
you bring yourself back to that anchor

00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:52,080
you do it over and over again and we see

00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:55,200
scientific

00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:58,000
proof that the prefrontal cortex

00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:59,360
actually grows so in people who are 50

00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,399
and 60 years old

00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:04,640
who have a mindfulness practice their

00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:06,480
prefrontal cortex looks like that of 20

00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:08,480
and 30 year olds

00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:10,159
so we all know that the brain just

00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:12,320
starts to thin

00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:13,840
as we get older but a mindfulness

00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:15,519
practice can help keep your brain

00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:17,919
resilient

00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:19,679
now we don't have time today to go into

00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:21,919
how to meditate

00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:24,720
so rather than doing that what i would

00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:27,760
like to do with the rest of our time

00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:31,120
is talk about mindfulness

00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:32,480
in daily life so just these kinds of

00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:34,399
situations

00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:36,080
like the fear of getting an assignment

00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:38,720
we don't have time for

00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:39,760
and figuring out how can we be more

00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:43,039
mindful

00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:46,480
when these situations face us

00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:49,360
so uh i'm a believer in that

00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:50,720
a nice nature walk and a cup of tea and

00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:53,360
a bubble bath

00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:54,240
those are all great and i'm sure we've

00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:56,880
all been told

00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:57,840
that those are solutions to our stress

00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:00,880
but really

00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:02,399
you know they're just temporary and they

00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:03,279
might make me feel good for a few

00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:05,200
minutes

00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:08,320
but then i'll get back to my desk and

00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:10,240
i'll feel the stress all over again

00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:11,360
and then there's the camp that talks

00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:16,000
about work-life

00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:17,840
balance and honestly that's not a thing

00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,000
it truly isn't you really need to

00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:22,000
optimize your life at any given moment

00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,960
and sometimes that means work takes your

00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,720
attention

00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:26,399
and sometimes that means your family

00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:27,039
takes your attention and sometimes that

00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:30,559
means your

00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:32,559
yourself takes that attention so

00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:35,760
thinking about work-life balance isn't

00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:39,440
really helpful either

00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:42,640
what you can do is recognize

00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:45,200
that you can't prevent stress

00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:47,440
so that's the thing thing number one

00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:50,080
you're not going to be able to prevent

00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:50,080
your stress

00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:55,440
come at this rest of this session with

00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:58,880
that acceptance

00:33:55,440 --> 00:34:02,559
what you can do is change your response

00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:04,159
to your stressors okay you can observe

00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:06,799
how you feel

00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:08,240
you can learn to control only what you

00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:10,879
can

00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:13,280
you can reframe challenges in your life

00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:16,240
as opportunities for growth

00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:18,079
and you can embrace digital well-being

00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:21,599
so we're going to talk about these four

00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:25,839
areas of stress and how and some

00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:28,560
some exercises that we can do to combat

00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:30,800
the stress and help us change our

00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:34,480
relationship to it

00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:36,320
the first one is the busy mind

00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:38,320
that constant chatter that goes on in

00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:41,359
your head and you think you're the only

00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:45,520
one who has that crazy busy mind

00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:49,359
right you're not

00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:51,679
okay everybody sits there with this

00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:54,159
mental to-do list planning and

00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:54,879
organizing and thinking if they don't do

00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:56,879
it

00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:58,160
themselves it's not going to come out

00:34:56,879 --> 00:35:01,280
right

00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:02,079
okay we all sit there saying why did i

00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:04,960
say that i

00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:07,440
should have done that differently or

00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:09,440
what if i don't make the right choice

00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:10,800
it's going to spiral out of control what

00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:12,640
if i say no

00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:14,160
my boss is going to get angry with me

00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:16,480
you don't know that because you didn't

00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:18,160
say no yet but that story is running in

00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:21,200
your mind

00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:23,680
right and then multitasking adds to this

00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:25,200
you're doing 10 things at once and your

00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:28,960
mind is designed

00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:31,119
to do one thing that's how you optimize

00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:34,079
your prefrontal cortex by doing

00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:34,720
one thing at a time so i'm going to give

00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:37,440
you an

00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:37,440
exercise

00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:46,960
to stop the chatter

00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:50,160
so when that exercise that we had

00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:52,400
with your big to-do list and

00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:54,079
somebody comes in your office and throws

00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:56,800
a new project at you

00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:59,119
that is questionable at best for your

00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:03,040
skill level

00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:04,880
you don't need to immediately react

00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:06,160
when you immediately react you're giving

00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:08,160
away your power

00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:09,599
because you haven't had the opportunity

00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:13,119
yet to think

00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:15,599
about what you want to do okay

00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:17,760
so now visualize you've got this big

00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:22,960
to-do list

00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:22,960
somebody came in and gave you more work

00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:30,720
now just like we did in the opening

00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:32,960
state what's happening within and around

00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,960
you

00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:38,720
every time you make a statement say to

00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:43,359
yourself

00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:47,760
what else what do you see

00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:49,839
what do you hear how do you feel

00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:50,960
you can even do that little body scan

00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:52,880
that we did

00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:54,560
starting at your feet working your way

00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:57,599
up your body

00:36:54,560 --> 00:37:00,160
noticing the places of stress

00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:02,720
noticing where the fear is sitting in

00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:02,720
your body

00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:09,680
not judging yourself not saying i should

00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:12,240
know how to handle this

00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:13,599
negative feelings are normal just don't

00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:17,680
identify with them

00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:20,079
it's okay to be say i'm scared right now

00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:22,640
i'm not sure what to do right now i'm

00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:25,520
stressed right now

00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:26,560
okay so it's not about stopping your

00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:28,480
thoughts

00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:30,560
it's about guiding your thoughts to

00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:33,839
become in tune

00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:36,640
with the present moment

00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:38,400
what is the context that you're in right

00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:41,359
now

00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:43,040
and by engaging in this practice by

00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:45,680
stopping

00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:48,160
taking a breath and observing what's

00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:51,200
going on around you

00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:52,720
you can put things in perspective and

00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,520
you can come back into the present

00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:55,760
moment

00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:57,280
just the action of going through these

00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:59,680
questions

00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:00,800
is enough for the amygdala to give

00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:03,359
control back

00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:05,920
to the other parts of your brain and

00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:08,240
turn them back on

00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:09,599
now sometimes you'll have an answer

00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:12,720
right away

00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:16,400
and sometimes you don't

00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:19,920
sometimes that answer takes a week

00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:22,000
or a month i had it once take me a year

00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:24,240
to figure out what the answer was to a

00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,720
big problem that i had

00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:27,520
okay but you'll proceed when you're

00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:30,400
ready

00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:32,640
because you've turned your brain back on

00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:34,560
so this is a really really powerful

00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:38,480
technique especially if you are

00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:38,960
not a meditator this will give you a lot

00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:41,839
of

00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:42,720
similar capabilities to turn your brain

00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:44,839
back on

00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:47,839
when it's just running in 10 different

00:38:44,839 --> 00:38:47,839
directions

00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:53,599
so earth put in the chat actually my

00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:57,040
boss taught me this trick

00:38:53,599 --> 00:39:00,720
ask about what should be prioritized and

00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:04,320
that is also going to turn your brain on

00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:04,720
because you're asking a question however

00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:07,359
when

00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:08,079
we're asking for prioritization we're

00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:12,079
already

00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:12,079
giving away our power to say no

00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:16,800
so we can maybe combine those two things

00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:19,839
together

00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:22,320
and say perhaps i can take it

00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:24,240
on if you can help me understand what

00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:27,119
the priorities are

00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:29,839
and that way you haven't already said

00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:29,839
yes

00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:41,119
so this first tip

00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:44,960
is to start to focus on

00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:46,800
all your senses you've got six of them

00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:48,880
the five that we learned in school and

00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:51,599
the sixth one is your mind

00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:54,560
focus on all your senses and bring your

00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:54,560
brain back online

00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:58,560
so the second one we're going to talk

00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:01,040
about

00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:02,800
is the inner critic and imposter

00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:04,800
syndrome

00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,839
that script that's running through your

00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:08,960
head

00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:10,880
is trying to keep you safe but it plays

00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:13,119
off your anxieties

00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:16,400
your fear of failure and rejection and

00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:18,079
inadequacy and uncertainty

00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:20,800
basically it's questioning your

00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:23,040
self-worth okay

00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:24,560
and sometimes this is actually a voice

00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:28,480
from the past

00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:30,880
maybe a parent or a teacher

00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:32,880
a boss it could have been an offhand

00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:34,560
remark from a friend

00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:35,920
and these voices start to become part of

00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:40,319
our identities

00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:44,400
and they aren't necessarily true

00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:46,319
okay at the same time

00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:48,079
many of us are judging everyone else

00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:50,839
around us

00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:52,079
okay so we're in this endless cycle of

00:40:50,839 --> 00:40:54,880
judgment

00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:58,319
and we have a choice we have a choice

00:40:54,880 --> 00:41:00,400
whether to believe this inner critic

00:40:58,319 --> 00:41:01,520
right we don't have to listen to these

00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:04,079
thoughts in our head

00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:05,599
they're just there they're there because

00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:08,880
we're trying to remain

00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:12,480
safe but they're just thoughts

00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:14,800
you're doing your best so

00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:15,839
the key here is becoming your own best

00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:18,839
friend

00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:21,680
and cultivating an inner coaching

00:41:18,839 --> 00:41:24,079
technique so if your friend came up to

00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:27,680
you your best friend came up to you

00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:31,440
and said i really think

00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:35,839
i messed up that project

00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:35,839
what would you do

00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:46,640
you likely put your arm around your

00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:50,000
friend

00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:51,920
and ask them to elaborate on it ah

00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:54,160
marcia says i would tell them i'm sure

00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:58,079
they did their best

00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:58,079
but we don't do that for ourselves do we

00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:02,079
can we learn to be our own best friend

00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:05,520
our own inner

00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:08,240
coach and treat ourselves with the same

00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:09,839
understanding and kindness that other

00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:13,839
people

00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:15,119
extend to us shanti says i would never

00:42:13,839 --> 00:42:18,079
talk to a friend the way i talk to

00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:20,880
myself yeah

00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:21,839
you need to be your own best friend so

00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:25,760
we're going to do

00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:30,079
a very short mindfulness practice

00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:30,079
on eliminating that voice of judgment

00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:32,880
so again

00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:36,560
let's start this practice by taking a

00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:39,760
few breaths

00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:43,040
when you hear that inner critic

00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:43,040
take an easy breath in

00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:48,000
and take an even slower breath out

00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:58,000
doing the best you're able to breathe in

00:42:54,480 --> 00:43:01,200
easy and breathe

00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,200
out slowly

00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:10,480
return back to that posture of both

00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:13,200
ease and dignity

00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:15,119
with your back straight relax your

00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:19,040
shoulders

00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:22,000
soften your belly release your tongue

00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:27,839
from the roof of your mouth

00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:27,839
that's one place nobody mentions stress

00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:32,319
but that helps relax your jaw

00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:41,839
and just keep breathing in and out

00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:51,760
so now bring to mind a time

00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:51,760
where you have felt judged

00:43:53,359 --> 00:43:58,560
maybe at school at work

00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:02,400
by a parent

00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:09,839
maybe it was when you were a child

00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:20,560
and notice right now how that judgment

00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:25,200
is more than just a thought

00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:33,680
maybe it affected how you felt

00:44:34,839 --> 00:44:39,920
emotionally

00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:50,560
maybe it created some tension or an ease

00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:53,119
somewhere in your body

00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:56,000
so when you're experiencing this kind of

00:44:53,119 --> 00:45:00,079
self-criticism

00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:00,079
notice where your thoughts go

00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:05,839
notice the patterns that begin to arise

00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:13,520
i'm never good at this i always need

00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:15,359
help with this

00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:18,240
i don't want other people to know i

00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:21,599
can't do this

00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:21,599
what if i make a mistake

00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:33,839
notice the patterns

00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:52,880
now leave that inner critic alone

00:45:53,200 --> 00:46:01,680
stop wrestling with it stop appeasing it

00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:05,440
don't even push it away

00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:08,000
just recognize what it feels like

00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:09,520
and let it be and stay with this

00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:14,960
experience

00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:17,599
without the self-criticism

00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:19,280
creating some distance between the

00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:29,839
situation

00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:29,839
and who you are

00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:42,720
every time you breathe in acknowledge

00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:47,119
and accept what you're experiencing

00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:47,119
in your body your emotions your thoughts

00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:51,760
there's nothing to fix or to change this

00:46:50,319 --> 00:46:57,839
is just the reality

00:46:51,760 --> 00:47:01,200
of what's going on right now

00:46:57,839 --> 00:47:04,720
and each time you breathe out

00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:04,720
offer yourself that relief

00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:11,200
talk to yourself as you would

00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:13,920
talk to your best friend in the same

00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:13,920
situation

00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:28,800
what would you say to that close friend

00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:31,680
breathing in this is how things are

00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:31,680
breathing out

00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:39,839
offering relief

00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:55,760
and to close this meditation wish

00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:57,680
yourself well

00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:59,440
not because you deserve it more than

00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:02,000
anyone else

00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:07,839
but because you deserve it as much as

00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:07,839
anyone else

00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:14,319
a few more deep breaths

00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:18,240
easy in breath

00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:21,839
longer out breath

00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:29,280
and if your eyes were closed you can

00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:29,280
open them now

00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:37,760
and just notice how that helped to

00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,680
separate

00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:42,319
those voices in your head from who you

00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:45,920
truly are

00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:49,200
treating yourself with greater kindness

00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:50,960
not only helps yourself but you then

00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:53,119
begin to extend that kindness to

00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:56,559
everyone around you

00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:56,559
we really need that right now

00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:02,800
okay the next thing we're going to

00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:06,079
discuss are obstacles

00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:10,559
obstacles that derail you and

00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:10,559
they keep you stuck in the past

00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:16,079
so this is truly a limiting belief this

00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:18,559
is the mental model we talked about

00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:19,599
earlier that keeps us from doing what we

00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:23,119
want

00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:25,839
okay so we don't make time to exercise

00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:27,920
or we sit in our jobs even if we're

00:49:25,839 --> 00:49:30,000
dissatisfied because we don't really

00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:32,880
want to go after that new job because

00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:35,119
maybe we're fearful that we're not good

00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:37,040
enough or we don't know enough

00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:39,680
maybe we're fearful that we don't have

00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:41,839
enough time or money to do what we want

00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:43,680
maybe we just feel like there are no

00:49:41,839 --> 00:49:45,839
options

00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:47,760
so you become ruled by these obstacles

00:49:45,839 --> 00:49:49,520
in your life and they begin to sap your

00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:51,359
energy and your focus and your

00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:53,760
motivation

00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:56,000
and the key to resolving this is to

00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:58,800
build your resilience

00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:00,880
we build resilience by taking control

00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:05,040
when we can

00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:07,280
and by accepting when it's not possible

00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:09,359
to give to own the control of the

00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:12,160
situation or a person

00:50:09,359 --> 00:50:13,200
okay we try to not dwell on i should

00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:16,240
have or

00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:19,359
what if and we start to reframe all our

00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:21,280
challenges as opportunities for growth

00:50:19,359 --> 00:50:23,280
and we do this by connecting to our

00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:28,000
sense of purpose

00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:30,319
okay so in this next reflection

00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:33,599
reflect on something that sparked joy or

00:50:30,319 --> 00:50:33,599
fulfillment in your life

00:50:36,079 --> 00:50:42,319
and if that's difficult for you

00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:45,599
maybe just list down on your paper

00:50:42,319 --> 00:50:48,559
three people that you admire

00:50:45,599 --> 00:50:48,960
so we're trying to get at what makes you

00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:53,359
feel

00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:58,400
fulfilled and connected

00:50:53,359 --> 00:51:01,440
give you a moment to come up with

00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:04,559
an and a situation in your life

00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:07,760
that gave you this

00:51:04,559 --> 00:51:10,240
feeling of connection with the world

00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:12,000
or coming up with three people that you

00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:13,760
admire

00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:16,000
and if you're doing the three people you

00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:16,880
admire start to write down the traits of

00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:23,839
those people that

00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:25,920
resonate with you why do you admire them

00:51:23,839 --> 00:51:28,240
if you're reflecting on what sparked joy

00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:30,400
and fulfillment in your life

00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:34,480
write down why what made you feel

00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:34,480
connected to that particular

00:51:34,839 --> 00:51:37,839
event

00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:43,920
so you're going to begin to notice some

00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:51,839
patterns and these

00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:51,839
patterns are going to reveal your values

00:51:54,240 --> 00:52:02,640
reconnecting with your values allows you

00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:05,200
to refine your sense of purpose

00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:07,119
and when you have a sense of purpose you

00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:09,760
can become more intentional

00:52:07,119 --> 00:52:11,599
in all your decision making by keeping

00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:14,640
your values in mind

00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:18,079
so that things don't become obstacles

00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:18,559
so if you think that you wake up too

00:52:18,079 --> 00:52:22,240
late

00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:24,160
to go to the gym and you're like i'll

00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:29,200
never be able to do this and i

00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:32,559
should be able to do this should you

00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:35,599
is health of value to you

00:52:32,559 --> 00:52:37,920
or are you basically just bumping up

00:52:35,599 --> 00:52:41,680
against an obstacle that you put in

00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:45,040
place that doesn't need to be there

00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:48,400
okay so looking at this list

00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:50,240
of values

00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:51,680
and there are many lists out there

00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:54,000
there's you could

00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:55,760
this is only 30 different values i know

00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:58,359
a lot of my values aren't even on this

00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:59,520
particular list which are things like

00:52:58,359 --> 00:53:02,720
authenticity

00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:06,000
um look at your values

00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:09,599
and connect them to what

00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:12,559
brings you joy in the world

00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:15,839
and then when you feel an obstacle look

00:53:12,559 --> 00:53:19,119
back at your values

00:53:15,839 --> 00:53:20,160
is it aligned with your values can you

00:53:19,119 --> 00:53:23,280
move ahead

00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:24,720
can you gain a sense of purpose with

00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:26,559
that obstacle

00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:28,000
because it is something that's going to

00:53:26,559 --> 00:53:31,040
ultimately bring you that

00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:33,839
sense of connection or duty

00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:33,839
or joy

00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:38,800
so we build integrity when we align our

00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:43,839
actions

00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:43,839
with our values

00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:49,599
anybody wants to share in the chat with

00:53:47,359 --> 00:53:53,440
each other what values you've chosen off

00:53:49,599 --> 00:53:53,440
this list please feel free to do so

00:53:53,839 --> 00:53:58,400
but it's super helpful to keep your

00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:01,599
values in mind

00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:03,599
each time you have a decision to make or

00:54:01,599 --> 00:54:05,599
feel struck by an obstacle or don't

00:54:03,599 --> 00:54:08,160
really know what direction to turn

00:54:05,599 --> 00:54:08,960
when your values are top of mind you'll

00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:11,520
find that

00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:13,359
really is easier to come to peace with

00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:15,920
the decisions that you make

00:54:13,359 --> 00:54:18,559
and all those should haves or what-ifs

00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:20,319
all melt away

00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:22,319
the people are sharing them in the chat

00:54:20,319 --> 00:54:25,839
those are beautiful

00:54:22,319 --> 00:54:25,839
thank you

00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:31,280
the last topic we're going to discuss

00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:34,400
today

00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:36,000
um i would be remiss if i didn't include

00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:37,680
some steps to recognize when

00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:39,280
technologists are burned out by their

00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:42,559
technology

00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:44,480
okay technology leads to poor sleep from

00:54:42,559 --> 00:54:47,440
being wired

00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:48,640
all those constant notifications the eye

00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:51,040
strain

00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:55,359
that lowered attention span that we have

00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:55,359
because we have this need to multitask

00:54:56,079 --> 00:55:00,079
we might have some gaming addiction or

00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:01,680
we're less connected with ourselves and

00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:04,880
others because we're so

00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:06,960
focused on managing our technology

00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:08,720
the social posts lead to fear of missing

00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:09,359
out i believe somebody mentioned that

00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:12,319
earlier

00:55:09,359 --> 00:55:13,200
in the session that they get stressed

00:55:12,319 --> 00:55:16,880
out when their

00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:19,599
um wife looks at social media posts and

00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:20,079
has a fear of missing out but they also

00:55:19,599 --> 00:55:22,400
lead to

00:55:20,079 --> 00:55:23,200
body image issues and bullying and

00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:25,760
loneliness

00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:28,160
and all this stress that comes from

00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:31,680
technology

00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:34,960
okay i believe i mentioned

00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:38,799
um at the beginning that a lot of

00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:42,079
my stress came from

00:55:38,799 --> 00:55:44,160
recognizing that i had to re-learn

00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:47,040
so much about putting up a site in

00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:49,920
drupal when we moved to drupal 8

00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:51,200
and then i went back to my values and i

00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:54,720
decided

00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:57,040
that i really no longer

00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:58,640
after all these years wanted to be in

00:55:57,040 --> 00:56:00,640
the technology space

00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:02,240
what i wanted to do was to bring relief

00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:07,280
to people in the technology

00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:07,599
space so this is super real especially

00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:10,960
for

00:56:07,599 --> 00:56:13,760
us because we are on our technology all

00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:13,760
day long

00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:19,119
so digital well-being is about

00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:20,880
maintaining a healthy relationship for

00:56:19,119 --> 00:56:21,760
your technology with your technology

00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:24,480
because

00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:25,359
we can't get rid of it okay so let's

00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:28,240
start with the

00:56:25,359 --> 00:56:30,240
doom scrolling that we all did um and

00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:33,200
maybe are still doing

00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:34,480
but certainly a year ago that is what we

00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:37,040
did

00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:39,839
we kept looking for news that was going

00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:41,920
to make us feel better

00:56:39,839 --> 00:56:43,200
we were looking for answers and there

00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:47,200
weren't any

00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:50,240
so we kept going and we kept scrolling

00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:52,079
and we got more anxious and then we saw

00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:54,000
other people get anxious

00:56:52,079 --> 00:56:55,760
and we went to the stores and we saw

00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:57,920
them filling their carts

00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:59,520
with all sorts of products and the

00:56:57,920 --> 00:57:02,799
shelves going bare

00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:06,799
and we got more anxious then too because

00:57:02,799 --> 00:57:06,799
anxiety is actually contagious

00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:15,599
so then we all turn to social media

00:57:13,119 --> 00:57:17,520
all those opinions and the sort of not

00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:19,839
quite facts that were out there and they

00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:22,079
put us on high alert

00:57:19,839 --> 00:57:25,040
so we had the pandemic and then we had

00:57:22,079 --> 00:57:27,040
all the social unrest that came about

00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:29,119
now all of that feels like a physical

00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:32,000
threat

00:57:29,119 --> 00:57:32,000
so we shut down

00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:39,119
okay we shut down from this

00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:41,599
so couple of things that we can do

00:57:39,119 --> 00:57:42,880
very very concrete things we can do with

00:57:41,599 --> 00:57:46,319
our technology

00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:46,960
is first audit your apps see if your

00:57:46,319 --> 00:57:49,040
usage

00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:51,200
aligns with the values and goals from

00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:52,960
our last exercise

00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:57,599
if they don't it's time to get rid of

00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:57,599
them or to reassess how you use them

00:57:58,079 --> 00:58:02,720
drop the multitasking multitasking leads

00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:05,040
us to lose concentration

00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:06,799
and focus if you have a lot of things to

00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:09,920
do in the day

00:58:06,799 --> 00:58:10,880
chunk them out work for two hours on a

00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:13,520
task

00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:14,319
take a nice break pick up a different

00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:16,400
task

00:58:14,319 --> 00:58:18,160
maybe plan your schedule in the morning

00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:20,000
so that it doesn't get hijacked by

00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:24,160
everybody else

00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:26,480
okay and nurture relationships

00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:27,680
relationships with other people can

00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:30,160
really keep us going

00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:31,599
a lot of people tend to spend their day

00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:34,079
alone right now

00:58:31,599 --> 00:58:35,920
alone at home and even if you use your

00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:38,880
technology

00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:39,520
to promote connection that will help

00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:42,960
release

00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:45,359
some of the stress and promote digital

00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:48,000
well-being

00:58:45,359 --> 00:58:49,599
the final thing is learn something new

00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:51,839
use your technology to teach you

00:58:49,599 --> 00:58:56,559
something

00:58:51,839 --> 00:58:56,559
and that again can promote more agency

00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:03,680
so we have some comments in the chat

00:59:01,119 --> 00:59:07,040
about ways that people

00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:09,760
handle doom scrolling and

00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:11,760
yeah just clean out clean out those

00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:15,119
thoughts

00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:17,520
so in summary awareness

00:59:15,119 --> 00:59:18,559
is about catching yourself when you

00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:20,880
decide

00:59:18,559 --> 00:59:22,559
not to change your actions when you're

00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:26,559
on that autopilot

00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:26,559
mode you're not in awareness

00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:33,280
so we want to be

00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:34,240
an observer okay observing ourselves

00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:36,240
what we think

00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:37,920
what we feel and what we notice in our

00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:39,680
bodies

00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:41,119
we want to begin to recognize those

00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:44,319
mental models

00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:46,240
that are holding you back i want to do

00:59:44,319 --> 00:59:49,599
all this with kindness

00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:49,599
and with non-judgment

00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:56,880
the way to do this is by asking yourself

00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:59,280
what you need

00:59:56,880 --> 01:00:01,599
accepting that you have the power to

00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:04,799
make new choices

01:00:01,599 --> 01:00:08,000
that you can reframe your actions

01:00:04,799 --> 01:00:10,319
that you can live your values and that

01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:11,280
you can understand that some situations

01:00:10,319 --> 01:00:14,559
are people

01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:17,920
simply won't align with your needs

01:00:14,559 --> 01:00:21,200
but when you stop and take that breath

01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:24,079
you bring your brain back online and you

01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:27,359
get the opportunity to take control

01:00:24,079 --> 01:00:30,160
of your reactions and turn them into

01:00:27,359 --> 01:00:30,160
responses

01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:37,839
so i truly appreciate

01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:43,200
having you all here today

01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:47,680
if there are any additional questions

01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:47,680
please feel free to add them to the chat

01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:51,839
i love that everybody spent a lot of

01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:55,520
time

01:00:51,839 --> 01:00:58,240
sharing and if you would like to

01:00:55,520 --> 01:01:00,559
start a meditation practice please feel

01:00:58,240 --> 01:01:04,000

01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:11,280
i do workplace mindfulness programs

01:01:07,839 --> 01:01:15,359
and create

01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:17,680
dress strategies

01:01:15,359 --> 01:01:18,400
so i hope that you'll reach out if you

01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:21,680
need

01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:24,079
any assistance in these areas and please

01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:27,280
if if you're really burned out

01:01:24,079 --> 01:01:30,480
a mental health expert is

01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:33,680
is truly important to have in your life

01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:36,880
so i wish you all a wonderful drupalcon
