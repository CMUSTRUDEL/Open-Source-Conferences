elves more in a minute but good morning

00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:07,040
i'm belinda vaughn

00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:09,599
and my co-presenter today is um

00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,559
laura ballet and our presentation will

00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:13,599
focus on

00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:15,599
how we strategically approached

00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:16,800
user experience during the redesign of

00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:18,800
stanford's

00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,080
gateway to financial activities website

00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:23,600
which we

00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:27,039
affectionately call fin gate

00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:30,000
next slide laura so the fingate website

00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:31,359
is heavily used by university staff and

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,239
other affiliates

00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:35,040
could you go to the next slide laura oh

00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:40,079
yeah it's there

00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:40,079
it should be anyway oh i don't see it

00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:45,840
i'm seeing the first slide still oh

00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:53,280
on my end it's showing oh no

00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:54,079
is anyone able to comment and chat if

00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:59,840
you're able to see

00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:59,840
the second slide

00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:08,000
yeah okay okay so maybe it's there with

00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,680
the word clout thank you

00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,680
sounds good well the fin as i was saying

00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,880
the fingate website is heavily used by

00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,040
university staff

00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,000
and other affiliates and while some

00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:19,040
users find

00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,280
the site helpful and comprehensive

00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,960
a large percentage of our users over

00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,759
time provided feedback

00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,000
that the site was time consuming and it

00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:28,400
was

00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,159
frustrating to use that the information

00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,280
and the architecture and layout was

00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,680
confusing

00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,560
and that it was just simply outdated so

00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,479
what do you do

00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,640
in that case well in our case we

00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:42,880
initiated a project to redesign

00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,360
the site laura and i are here today to

00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,399
share

00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,360
how design thinking was really core to

00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:50,000
the redesign

00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:52,000
project and how key decisions were

00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,360
guided by the user research that we

00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,159
conducted

00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,719
we also will share some key learnings

00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,880
related to the importance of

00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:02,960
discoverability

00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,960
and findability of the content

00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,799
so where do i begin

00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,440
prior to embarking on what ended up

00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:14,400
being a 20-month long redesign project

00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:16,319
due to enlarged part based on the size

00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,800
and complexity of the site

00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:20,800
we needed to engage a vendor partner so

00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,680
after a pretty exhaustive

00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:28,239
rfp process we made the right decision

00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:28,239
in selecting imagex media as our partner

00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,200
a little bit about

00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:35,120
as the director of learning solutions

00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,680
for stanford's financial management

00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,560
services

00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:41,200
organization i was really responsible

00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,800
and accountable for the project

00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,640
and as the director of digital

00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,360
experience for imagex

00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:49,280
laura led the user research there were

00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,200
many more people involved in the project

00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,200
from both sides including project

00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:56,400
management drupal development

00:02:53,200 --> 00:03:00,159
design web and content management

00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,159
and of course content writers

00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:04,000
the old finn gates site was first

00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,120
released

00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,280
in 2007 that was a long time ago and

00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:12,400
while the content was added

00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:14,159
over time the overall site design had

00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,959
really not changed while web

00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:18,640
technology had dramatically and changed

00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:21,120
since it was first launched

00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,920
the purpose of the site really remained

00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,159
the same

00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,680
it was to help users quickly find the

00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:29,120
information they needed

00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:32,400
to perform financial tasks accurately

00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:35,840
efficiently and within policy

00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:38,239
fingade isn't as is and was and still is

00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,920
an essential platform for staff faculty

00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:43,120
students and suppliers

00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:44,640
we are averaging around 1500 user

00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,599
sessions and 5 000

00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:49,599
page views per day and the fi the thing

00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:51,680
gate design and functionality was really

00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:56,319
no longer meeting our needs

00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:58,799
um or the needs of our campus users

00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:00,720
so i have to say that finngate has a lot

00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:03,840
of content

00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:06,879
it provides business process overviews

00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:08,159
policies detailed instructions and

00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:10,480
resources

00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:12,319
the scope of the activities includes

00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,640
everything from account setup to

00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:16,639
purchasing and contracts to business and

00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:19,359
travel expenses

00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:21,680
payroll and much much more and through

00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:24,479
the redesign

00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:26,560
we had approximately 2 000 pages of

00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:28,800
content that we were able to condense

00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,759
down to approximately a thousand pages

00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,759
of content

00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,120
and the information architecture was

00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:36,320
streamlined to help people

00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,320
absorb that content

00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:43,360
user-centered design and design thinking

00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,320
and user research was really a big part

00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,000
of the success

00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,680
and we knew that it would be from the

00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,120
very very beginning it was really

00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:52,320
important to us

00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:56,080
and so why well the site had grown

00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:59,199
organically over time and we felt out of

00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:01,840
touch with our users and their needs

00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:03,919
we knew that there was dissatisfaction

00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,960
and we wanted to solve for user pain

00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:07,680
points

00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:09,520
we also had a large group of users who

00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,240
had learned over time where to find

00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,639
information

00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,800
on the site they became kind of resident

00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:16,800
or local experts and they were

00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,479
they played the role of helping people

00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,759
we wanted to understand what worked and

00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:22,560
didn't work for them too

00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:23,600
because we didn't want to alienate them

00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:27,360
so this began

00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,360
our redesign journey

00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:33,919
we started with several inputs that were

00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:36,240
coalesced to help us determine what we

00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:39,360
were solving for and this determined our

00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:42,000
focus areas inputs included

00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,960
a 2018 client satisfaction survey

00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,360
findings

00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:47,520
that highlighted the fact that users

00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,720
really were dissatisfied with the poor

00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:52,080
searchability

00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:54,720
unclear navigation confusing page layout

00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:56,240
and architecture we also did a

00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,880
competitive analysis

00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:01,199
of related university finance sites and

00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,440
that further reinforced the need for us

00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,840
to

00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:05,280
update the site's outdated technology

00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:08,319
and make way for

00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:09,199
enhancement opportunities we conducted

00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:11,840
pre-mortem

00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:13,440
sessions with key stakeholders to

00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:16,319
understand their vision

00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:18,000
and goals for the site and last but not

00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:20,400
least at all we conducted

00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,280
initial user interviews to learn more

00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,319
about

00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:27,680
the user roles their

00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:27,680
points and their goals

00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:32,240
so on this slide we have some quotes

00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,240
that represent

00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,840
common themes we heard during these

00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,160
initial interviews

00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,680
users voiced their challenges with

00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,840
having to drill to get to the

00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:44,080
information they needed

00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,199
feeling like they were throwing staff

00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:48,319
into a bullpen

00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:49,280
when recommending fin gate um that one

00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:53,039
really hurt

00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:54,720
when we heard that um one they wanted to

00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:55,520
search to work better for them they

00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,759
wanted

00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,440
to be more like a google search and

00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:03,840
they're getting frustrated with the

00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,840
overall content organization of the site

00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,960
all of these inputs led us to defining

00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:11,440
the project

00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:14,000
project user experience goals of

00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:16,479
improving findability of content

00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,160
both through navigation and search

00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,360
supporting user productivity

00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,160
improvements

00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:24,560
and being mobile friendly the project

00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:28,000
goals were directly relevant to

00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:31,199
defining the research strategy

00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,800
and with that as background i'm going to

00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:34,560
hand it over to laura

00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,479
again she's the director of digital

00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,960
experience with emma jacks

00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:39,919
and she'll talk about research research

00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,479
methods

00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:44,240
design principles and key takeaways from

00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:47,039
the project

00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,240
great thank you so much belinda nice to

00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:50,879
meet everyone here

00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,879
so i'm going to quickly walk you through

00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:54,560
a little bit of a high level of research

00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:56,879
methods just to orient you

00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,000
in the world of user research and then

00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:00,639
explain a little bit

00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,240
about our thinking and process as the

00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:04,560
project evolved

00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,080
so the first thing i want to note about

00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:09,440
user research methods

00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:12,400
is there are a lot of them and

00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,800
knowing what your user experience goals

00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,039
are

00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:17,039
from the get-go is the very first step

00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:18,960
to knowing what methods you need to be

00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:20,960
using so in other words you have to

00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,319
match the goal to the method

00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,000
you have to know what you're trying to

00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:25,759
achieve and the questions you're trying

00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,080
to answer and solve for

00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:30,400
to be able to locate the right research

00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:32,240
tool so really think of those methods as

00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,120
a toolbox and you can kind of rifle

00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,560
through them

00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,800
knowing what it is that you're trying to

00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:38,719
build and find the right tool to support

00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:41,519
that

00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:42,880
so when we began this journey as melinda

00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:44,720
had already noted

00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,560
it was really really important for us to

00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,920
understand what our goals were up front

00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,760
and those goals came

00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,959
through conversations with our key

00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:53,279
stakeholders

00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:55,440
with subject matter experts as well as

00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:57,600
the end audience and users

00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:00,240
and so that helped us figure out what

00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:02,000
our research questions were going to be

00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,920
because many of these questions were

00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,600
qualitative in nature meaning we were

00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:09,279
wondering like what and how

00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:11,519
and why as we iterated we did a lot of

00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:12,320
qualitative research to support those

00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:14,160
questions

00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,760
but we also knew what we wanted to

00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,519
measure after launch

00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:19,839
so that helped us figure out the right

00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:22,000
quantitative research tools to have in

00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:23,279
place so that after the site launched we

00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,200
could continue to learn

00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:26,800
and refine the experience from that

00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,800
point onwards

00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,720
so you'll see here our initial goals

00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,519
were again the same themes that belinda

00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,839
had touched on

00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:36,480
earlier which is around usability ease

00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:38,560
of use appearance comprehension

00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,839
credibility and then our research

00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,360
questions were learning more about

00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:42,800
people's pain points

00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,399
and how they were moving through the

00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,959
site and how they were thinking of these

00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:48,000
really big

00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:50,000
concepts big meeting needy concepts

00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,080
and learning how we could better support

00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,680
them through the site and making it easy

00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,680
for them to use and comprehend

00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:59,600
so the research methods that we did end

00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,399
up doing so we had five rounds of

00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,640
research so

00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:04,560
five different studies over 20 months

00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:06,959
this involved a total of

00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:09,120
more than 60 participants representing

00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:11,680
17 business units

00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,160
uh and these participants were pulled

00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,480
from

00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:16,240
a client satisfaction survey that kind

00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,000
of kick-started the whole project so at

00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,680
that point we had a large

00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,360
group of people who had already

00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,560
indicated that they were interested in

00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,399
participating

00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,760
so one thing i'd strongly recommend is

00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:28,880
if you know you're having

00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:31,120
a project that's going to be unfolding

00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:33,200
in the future whenever you launch a

00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,760
survey like that just ask people to opt

00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,399
in

00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:38,160
have them um send their hands up and say

00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:39,519
yes i'd love to participate along the

00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,560
way because it'll make your lives a lot

00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:42,959
easier

00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:45,120
um through this we were able to really

00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:46,000
get a diverse group of users meeting

00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,079
people from all

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,680
across the stanford campus including

00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:52,320
different roles departments

00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:56,320
years of experience at stanford as well

00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:58,959
as age and gender combinations

00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:01,040
what did the research look like well it

00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:02,959
was a lot of different ways that we

00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,880
executed on this we did small focus

00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:05,839
groups larger co-design sessions

00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,839
semi-structured

00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:09,360
interviews we did things in person we

00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:11,839
did them remote we did them

00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,680
asynchronously and synchronously

00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:15,040
um so it was really wonderful to be able

00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:17,200
to explore

00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:19,440
um getting feedback in many many

00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:22,079
different ways along that journey

00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,120
we also had a baseline survey so again

00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:25,040
i'm measuring things

00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,800
before the site launched and then a

00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,800
post-launch survey so that we could

00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:31,680
compare and contrast that before and

00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,680
after state

00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:35,839
so we use these ux goals and user

00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:39,120
research insights

00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:41,360
to informally along the way to create a

00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,200
set of design principles

00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,200
so design principles if you're not

00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,360
already familiar with them

00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,720
is essentially a concise set of like

00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,320
rules of play that help

00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,160
inform decisions that you're making

00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,880
along the way particularly when you

00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,720
don't have that

00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,639
immediate access to your end user so

00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,320
sometimes questions or comments will

00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:59,839
come up in conversations

00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,760
as you're going through the development

00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:03,279
process and you don't have enough time

00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,040
to do user study

00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:06,959
so a design principle can be really

00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,399
helpful in terms of guiding those

00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:10,000
decisions

00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:12,240
if you're interested in some common

00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,320
examples i have linked here

00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,800
a site that collects many many that you

00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:18,959
can find online

00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:21,120
um the most common set of design

00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:22,000
guidelines that's usually referred to in

00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,800
the web world

00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,639
is jacob nielsen's general heuristics

00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,480
for interaction design

00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:30,000
um the six that ended up being most

00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,839
relevant to finngate

00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,519
were being able to match the user's

00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:35,839
sense of the system in terms of both

00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:36,880
presentation of content and language use

00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:39,920
and workflows

00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:41,680
to the systems use of those those

00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:43,839
workflows that support them

00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:45,680
also ensuring consistency throughout of

00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:47,200
course is really important

00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:49,200
and not forcing people to have to

00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:51,360
remember how to use the system to be

00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,800
able to locate a task or locate those

00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,320
workflows

00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,399
at the same time bearing in mind that we

00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,720
have a lot of novice users we wanted to

00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:00,880
create shortcuts or accelerators to help

00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:04,079
expert users so that was a really

00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:05,519
important concept as well

00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:07,040
also just understanding what the

00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:08,480
audience in general considers to be

00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,480
aesthetically pleasing

00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,920
because we knew we wanted to update the

00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,440
look and feel of the site

00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:15,760
but we didn't want it to get in the way

00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:17,600
of any of those efficient workflows

00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:19,839
and then lastly building in help and

00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,839
support throughout the system so if

00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:23,600
anyone came across a roadblock

00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:25,519
they were able to locate what that next

00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,079
step was in terms of resolving their

00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:29,440
question

00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:30,959
or workflow that they were researching

00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,800
so the design principles that we

00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:36,720
extracted from our research

00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:38,959
was uh really understanding more about

00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,800
those different types of campus users

00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:41,519
and how we could support their differing

00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,240
and diverse

00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:45,519
needs tasks and goals so while some of

00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,760
them had been at stanford

00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:49,279
for many many years other people we were

00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:51,600
assuming had started their role

00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:52,320
earlier say like this week so we needed

00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,920
to

00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:57,760
design for that full spectrum of users

00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,760
as you can imagine campus users were

00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:01,440
also accessing fingay in many different

00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,279
ways so again diversity

00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,120
and they were wanting to digest content

00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:06,079
in different ways so some were there for

00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,000
a few seconds

00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:09,680
every once in a while so it's very

00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,519
fleeting quick interactions

00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:13,519
while others were spending a lot of time

00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:15,279
in the system and might want to be

00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:17,120
spending even more time getting

00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:19,760
familiar with the content and getting

00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:22,480
familiar and better at their roles

00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:24,800
and then lastly there are people who

00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:28,000
might want to be balancing those quick

00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:29,120
seasonal transactions but also at the

00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,600
same time

00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,880
learning about more complex financial

00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,680
concepts

00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:37,680
and so over time exposing them to

00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:39,600
incremental learning or incremental

00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,160
concepts would be really important to

00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,160
help them

00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:44,000
evolve in their role and involve with

00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:48,639
their knowledge with fin gate and other

00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:50,720
financial information so key takeaways

00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:51,760
we wanted to share some principles that

00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,480
we thought would be

00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:56,000
useful to many others in the audience as

00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,000
well so things that you could extract

00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,320
from our research that might help you in

00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,760
your

00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:03,120
own projects so the first one is context

00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:06,240
really matters

00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,720
meaning knowing what is surrounding the

00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,560
user

00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,480
in their day-to-day can really help

00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,199
shape the nature of your own design

00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,320
strategy

00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:16,399
so in our project we knew very very

00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:19,040
early on we learned from

00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:19,519
users about how different their typical

00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,240
day

00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:23,760
is like so across different roles we

00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,320
learned that there were generalists and

00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,720
there were

00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:28,560
specialists and generals for example

00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,639
were relying on finngate to get really

00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,480
quick access to specific links and

00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:34,000
tidbits of information so what this

00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,839
looked like in practice

00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,480
is we built in some of those

00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:40,399
accelerators so common access points

00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:42,639
to the financial systems that they were

00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:44,079
using we also created a spot that would

00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:47,040
allow them to quickly find

00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:48,399
content that they previously located and

00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:50,639
when we spoke with users

00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:51,920
as we're iterating uh they indicated

00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:54,399
that these small

00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:55,360
seemingly tiny editions added a lot of

00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:58,880
value to them

00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:01,120
for the site a second

00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:02,639
key takeaway you can learn from other

00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,959
disciplines so in our case

00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:06,079
instructional design helped inform our

00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:08,000
content strategy

00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:10,399
and information design so we grouped

00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,680
related content for users to discover

00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:12,720
and use things like progressive

00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,800
disclosure

00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,720
to keep them from being overwhelmed by

00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:18,880
information overload

00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,839
what this looked like in practice is we

00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:23,040
built in ways for passive learning

00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:25,120
experiences so we had contextual

00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,240
learning so this content related to this

00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,880
page

00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:30,959
was one way that we tried to surface

00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:32,800
information that might be relevant

00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:35,199
and contextual to the search or the

00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:37,199
discovery that they've conducted

00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:39,199
for those who are more actively seeking

00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:40,720
training and education we built in a

00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:43,279
learning path generator

00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,320
that would provide immediate content

00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:46,399
recommendations

00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:48,639
to help assist them with their learning

00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:50,959
journey

00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:52,959
our third takeaway is that mental models

00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:54,720
matter a mental model is just how

00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:56,160
someone thinks of something so as we

00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:58,079
touched on earlier

00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:00,160
a top priority for us was really

00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:02,079
listening and learning from campus users

00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,959
and that meant we had to really really

00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:05,439
listen to

00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:07,520
and absorb how they were describing

00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:08,079
concepts and how the system language

00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,640
reflect

00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:11,679
theirs so our labels and navigation were

00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,919
subjected to

00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:15,360
a few rounds of validation and testing

00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:18,959
along the way

00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:20,880
so here i've shown two examples of card

00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:23,039
sorting exercises and these were very

00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,000
analog in nature we just used tiny slips

00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:26,319
of paper

00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
and we did this so we could develop our

00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:30,400
navigational menu which

00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,320
looked like this in the end but those

00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:35,440
slips of paper helped us build

00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:37,679
this later on and at the end when we

00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:40,320
were testing this in the final round

00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:42,000
the vast majority of our participants

00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,919
confirmed that the menu

00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,600
names made sense to them which was very

00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:48,640
very reassuring to us because that was

00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,640
absolutely our goal

00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,799
our fourth principle is just

00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:55,120
understanding that there are both

00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:57,679
searchers and discoverers so going back

00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:59,919
to those general usability heuristics

00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:01,600
flexibility in a system is super super

00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:02,720
important and we learned we had an

00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,960
audience where

00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:06,240
roughly half of them wanted to just more

00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,480
organically discover

00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:10,000
information and explore it while the

00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:12,640
other half wanted to

00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,480
really quickly access and search through

00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:17,280
keywords or drilling down through

00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:19,200
a navigational menu so we had to bring

00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,640
the content to them in several different

00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,880
ways

00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,840
um some of the ways that we built into

00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:26,840
our home page

00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:29,520
was of course things like search and

00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:32,400
navigation but things like messaging

00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:33,760
showing featured topics um building in a

00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:36,400
personalized user path

00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:38,559
and allowing them to search by themes so

00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:40,960
this allowed people to find

00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:41,679
um content in a variety of different

00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,360
ways

00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:45,520
by different themes invite different

00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,960
topics and different ways of accessing

00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:49,520
it

00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:51,200
lastly it was really important for us to

00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:52,880
design for credibility so i'm going to

00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,320
hand this over to belinda to talk a

00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:57,440
little bit about that

00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:58,320
yeah thank you laura um so the final

00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,320
takeaway as

00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:02,400
laura said is designing for credibility

00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:04,960
and this is really important to us

00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,919
um you know trust needs to be built it

00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:09,760
doesn't just happen

00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:12,640
overnight and we have a large um

00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:13,520
population of users who use the site

00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,840
every day

00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:18,640
in performing their job and it was

00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:20,720
really important to us

00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:22,480
that those users had trust you know we

00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,520
felt like we had lost it over the years

00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,679
since we had

00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:27,039
developed the site so what this meant

00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:29,520
for our project

00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:30,080
was engaging users throughout the design

00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,480
process

00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:35,280
as we just described to understand their

00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:37,120
needs and expectations and it also

00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:39,039
we wanted to provide is really important

00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:40,160
for us to provide this ongoing methods

00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:43,520
for them to provide

00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:47,039
feedback so as an example

00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:49,280
the design provided users the ability to

00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:51,120
from any page on the site click a link

00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:53,600
and report a content error or just

00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:56,000
provide feedback

00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:58,160
and they can also view the date the

00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,880
content was last updated which adds to

00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,280
the overall

00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,799
credibility of the content so this may

00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:06,240
seem really simple

00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:06,880
but we feel it goes a long way and when

00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,400
we resp

00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:11,280
we monitor those um reports we respond

00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,320
to them

00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:17,280
like i said they could either be a

00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:19,520
feedback about new content or fixing or

00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:21,600
resolving some issue with content and

00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:23,120
when we respond back to people they're

00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,320
just thrilled they feel like they're

00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:28,000
part of the process

00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:29,520
and and so it that's been very important

00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,440
to the project and

00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:33,120
and it's i feel good about it i'll go

00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:35,039
respond to some of these because

00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:36,320
it's great people are surprised that

00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:39,840
you're listening

00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:41,919
um so how does our story end it's it's

00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:44,159
well it's never really over because it's

00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:46,320
a living breathing breathing site but

00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:48,000
we did launch the new site on august

00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:52,080
31st 2021

00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:54,720
and we had a record 10 000 page views on

00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:56,880
day one and we've continued to have our

00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:59,120
average page views since then

00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,080
the site no longer looks outdated it's

00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:02,960
mobile friendly

00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:05,360
as you can see here in the in the slide

00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:07,760
and during final interviews users shared

00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,559
how much they like the new site um they

00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:11,039
acknowledge

00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:12,000
the improvements they're sharing their

00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:14,159
appreciation

00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,600
for us listening to them and addressing

00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:17,600
their feedback

00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:19,760
and just overall by including user

00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:21,840
research in the redesign project

00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:23,120
we feel that we met our goals and we

00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:27,039
also feel that we

00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:30,159
better met the goals of our users um

00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:31,760
so that's it um excuse me for our

00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:35,280
presentation i think

00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:35,280
we probably want to look at chat

00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:41,039
looks like we have a few questions um

00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,120
looks like

00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:44,080
one is around card sorting how did it

00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:47,679
work with so many

00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:50,799
pages great question we didn't

00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:53,039
do card sorting for all thousand pages

00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:54,080
we really wanted to understand the top

00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:57,200
level

00:21:54,080 --> 00:22:00,000
menu design so we began with

00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,400
actually i will go back to the slide

00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,159
where

00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:07,200
it talks about the different content

00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:13,600
sorry bear with me here it's very slow

00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:17,840
to respond

00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:19,520
so here um we started with these first

00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:21,360
two levels with the activity

00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:23,760
and subject area so that's where we

00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:24,159
primarily concentrated our card sorting

00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,760
on

00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:27,200
belinda did you have anything you wanted

00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:30,640
to add about that

00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:34,480
yeah um you know we had

00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:38,240
um on the old site we had uh

00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:39,840
about seven different categories and

00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,440
you know as we the feedback that we got

00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:43,760
from users is it

00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:46,240
they just didn't really make sense um as

00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:48,159
they navigated through the site

00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,840
the labels the way the content was

00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:51,600
organized didn't make sense so the card

00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:53,840
sorting was really important

00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:55,600
to us to really validate what we were

00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:57,520
thinking in terms of the new system

00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,320
architecture so laura led the session

00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:01,120
which i

00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:01,600
i highly recommend having a third party

00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,440
into

00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:05,919
somebody who's not as vested in your

00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:08,799
site kind of lead the user activities

00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:09,600
we were very involved in in looking at

00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:13,039
the output

00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:14,480
um but you know it was good to kind of

00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:16,640
take a back seat to that

00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:18,799
if you will i think our users felt much

00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:20,480
more open and eager to provide feedback

00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:21,679
they didn't want to hurt our feelings in

00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:24,720
the process

00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:26,000
so um so yeah the card sorting was

00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:29,120
really to

00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:31,200
give them an opportunity to um

00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:33,440
you know laura had created cards with

00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:35,440
all of the kind of level one and two

00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:37,120
navigation on it we gave them to them

00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:39,039
all mixed up and we said

00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:40,960
okay you organize it the way you think

00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:42,640
about it back to these mental models

00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:44,559
you know we didn't want to assume that

00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:47,360
the way we had organized it

00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:49,200
was the right way and so through these

00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:51,279
card sorting activities it really

00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,240
validated helped us refine it helped us

00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:54,480
validate

00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:55,279
um what we were thinking about in terms

00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:58,159
of how we

00:23:55,279 --> 00:24:00,159
um organized this um into these primary

00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:02,080
activities and

00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:04,559
and topics as you saw in the menu that

00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:06,159
that laura displayed

00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:07,919
yeah thank you for that belinda looks

00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:10,320
like we had another question around

00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:11,120
sharing the rfp for this project so it

00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,880
says

00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:14,799
would you be able to share your rfp for

00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:16,400
the project my institutions going

00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:17,520
through a redesign it'd be helpful to

00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:20,000
see how you approached

00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:21,440
seeking a vendor so belinda i will hand

00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,080
that one over to you

00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,960
yeah i'd be happy to go back and look at

00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,480
it and and

00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:28,880
make sure that there wasn't anything

00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:32,080
proprietary in it um

00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:35,440
i as i said it was a pretty robust

00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:39,360
rfp process we actually

00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:40,400
um solicited input from 17 different

00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:43,039
vendors

00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:44,960
and we got responses back from 12 which

00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:46,720
was still a lot

00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:48,480
and so we had to cull through all of

00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:50,799
that and then kind of

00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51,919
uh led us down a path to getting to

00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:54,720
selecting

00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:56,000
um three candidates and then inviting

00:24:54,720 --> 00:25:00,960
them in for

00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:03,760
um presentations and follow-ups so um

00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,960
may sound like a lot of work but it was

00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:08,080
important to us

00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:08,720
um it was also important for us to for

00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:11,120
the

00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,840
our vendor partner to really know up

00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:14,799
front

00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:16,640
that we wanted to do user um we wanted

00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:18,320
to do user studies and that

00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:19,840
that needed to be part of the project

00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:22,640
and we wanted to plan it in

00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:24,799
um like i said we had designed the site

00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:27,200
back in 2007 we did a lot

00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:28,559
of user research in the design but it

00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,640
had grown and

00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:31,840
and just evolved over time so we wanted

00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:35,200
to go back to

00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:39,919
um that process so i'd be happy to

00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:43,039
um if you can somehow um

00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:45,440
send your um your email address in the

00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:46,159
chat i'll go i'll go look at the rfp and

00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:49,279
see if it's

00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:50,880
okay to share yeah and i just noted in

00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:51,279
the chat i saw that there were a couple

00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,000
of

00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:56,080
comments around providing the link so we

00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,279
will be sharing the deck afterwards so

00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:59,279
please look for it there but

00:25:57,279 --> 00:26:01,760
if you want me to just directly share it

00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:03,279
with you feel free to drop me a line and

00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:05,520
if you have questions for me or belinda

00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:07,600
you're welcome to do it that way as well

00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:10,000
uh looks like we had one other question

00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:12,559
around final interviews it said did

00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,520
we conduct final interviews immediately

00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:15,039
after the launch

00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,720
or did we wait some time before

00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:18,400
conducting interviews again

00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:20,400
so i'll take a first stab at this and

00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:23,360
then hand it over to belinda about

00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:24,080
sort of the ongoing measurements we did

00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,240
interviews

00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:27,600
throughout the project so those five

00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:31,039
rounds of user

00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:32,000
um testing sessions all to a certain

00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:34,559
degree

00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,520
involved some amount of interviews so

00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:37,440
some were more

00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:39,679
usability testing so it wasn't

00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:41,919
interviews per se we asked people to do

00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:43,600
tasks and watch them do them where

00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:44,960
others were more semi-structured

00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:47,760
interviews but it was an

00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:49,120
iterative user research process

00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:52,320
throughout

00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:55,440
the last set of user testing we did was

00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:58,000
pre-launch like right up the

00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:59,600
tail end of the development cycle we did

00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:03,600
one last round

00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:05,600
and then we did a post-launch survey

00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:08,000
belinda maybe i'll hand it over you to

00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:10,159
kind of expand upon

00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,919
what those interviews look like and any

00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:14,240
plans going forward for

00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:15,520
continuing to stay in touch with users

00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:18,640
yeah thank you laura

00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:20,880
so as laura said we did a you know even

00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:24,399
though we had a lot of feedback from our

00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:27,120
2018 client satisfaction survey um

00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:28,720
part of our overall success metrics was

00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:31,840
to be able to measure improvement

00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:35,919
so before we launched very close to

00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:38,799
to before we launch we we did this um

00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:40,640
uh pre survey and then and that's where

00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:44,240
we got the word cloud you saw

00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:46,880
um in the um in the slide deck um

00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:47,279
with the sentiment we asked people about

00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,520
their

00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:50,320
their satisfaction with the site and we

00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:53,520
asked for

00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:55,120
um you know for for them to kind of

00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:56,960
share their experience with using the

00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:59,120
site and then we repeated that

00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:02,320
um it's about three or four months

00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:04,960
following the launch we repeated that

00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:05,679
and so that was a good um gauge point we

00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:08,320
also

00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:09,360
we have a number of uh forums across

00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:11,360
campus so we've

00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:13,840
we went out and post launched presented

00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:18,159
to forums i even did some

00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:20,080
some meetings with specific departments

00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:22,000
and that's where we got some really

00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:23,200
open candid feedback from people who

00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,159
were using the site

00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:27,120
as well as i said the the input that we

00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:29,679
got from people

00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:31,279
responding to the um to the links and

00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:33,760
the sites themselves

00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:35,200
we also very closely monitored our

00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:38,000
support center

00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,640
um our support center is where people

00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,640
will come

00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:41,679
from across campus contact them if they

00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:43,279
need help for

00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:44,960
any of their transactions that they're

00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:48,240
doing and so

00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:51,200
we for the couple months following

00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:52,080
um the launch we very closely monitored

00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:55,200
you know those

00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:56,320
tickets coming in and were there any was

00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,480
there any feedback

00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:00,960
or questions directly related to the

00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,960
launch of the

00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:05,360
