	00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:04,799
all right

00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:06,399
are we ready to get started then all

00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:09,280
right let's go ahead and get started

00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:10,559
um hi there uh welcome to uh

00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:14,880
transforming from

00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:17,119
doing agile to being agile um

00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,800
as i mentioned before uh we have uh two

00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:21,119
of us here in the same room

00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,119
um

00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:27,039
so my name is george dimette i'm the

00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:29,679
founder and ceo of palantir.net

00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:30,480
and i'm tiffany ferris i'm the ceo of

00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:33,840
palantir

00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:37,040
as well yes and so uh you know we are

00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:39,840
um a digital consultancy uh we are

00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,399
based near chicago we um have team

00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,600
members

00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:44,160
and spread across the united states and

00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,879
uh

00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,000
we are actually celebrating our 25th

00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:51,360
year in business

00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
uh this year and so this session is a

00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,960
little bit

00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,920
about um you know a part of our journey

00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,640
that we've taken

00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:01,520
over the last few years as we've sort of

00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:04,879
grown and evolved as an organization

00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:08,159
and so where i want to start

00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:10,880
uh is with the the question of what is

00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,240
agile right so many of you are probably

00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,720
familiar with

00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,520
you know the agile tools and practices

00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:18,640
right you do

00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:19,439
stand up scrums you have your your

00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:23,200
tickets so you

00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:24,320
might use jira trello or some other tool

00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:28,479
like that

00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:31,439
uh you have um you know story points

00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:33,360
and estimation you can probably use some

00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:36,799
sort of continuous integration tool

00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:39,119
like circle ci travis jenkins etc

00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,560
um you may even if you're you know

00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:44,479
depending on your organization

00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:46,560
uh you might use one of the uh the large

00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:48,240
you know one of the frameworks uh like

00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,000
safe or less

00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,000
which are really designed for enterprise

00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,040
agile so that is one part and i think

00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,920
that's the part that

00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,439
most folks who are you know been working

00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,439
in software development certainly in the

00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:01,280
last you know 10 to 20 years are most

00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:03,920
familiar with

00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,040
but what's also interesting about agile

00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,239
is really

00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:10,399
all of those tools and practices

00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:13,200
are meant to serve a set of values and

00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:15,680
principles and the values and principles

00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:18,640
are really things that come directly out

00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:21,360
of the agile manifesto which was that

00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,000
you know start of the agile movement

00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,879
when a group

00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,640
of software engineers got together about

00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:28,800
20 years ago

00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,879
for retreat and kind of came up with

00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,760
these that were kind of frustrated with

00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:33,680
the state of

00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:35,920
of software development and really came

00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:39,680
up with these principles

00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:43,680
and values for how they wanted

00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:46,000
a better way to develop software so

00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,120
when you put both of these things

00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,400
together

00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,239
what you actually get is something

00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:54,080
called the agile mindset

00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:55,440
right and so it is um

00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,000
seeing someone might be having some

00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:01,040
issues with audio and video

00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,400
um so if anyone else is having trouble

00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,159
with that please

00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,760
okay looks like it may be an individual

00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:08,800
issue okay thank you

00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:10,560
um so so when you take those and you put

00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:13,200
it together when you use

00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,280
you know these frameworks these these

00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,480
tools these techniques the structures

00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:21,040
and it's informed

00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:23,040
by the values and principles of agile

00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:25,120
you're you're engaging in what's called

00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:28,400
the agile mindset right

00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:30,720
it's where you go from just doing

00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:33,040
the agile things to actually thinking in

00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:36,400
a more agile way

00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:38,640
so there's uh simon powers who

00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,400
runs a agile training organization

00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,400
called adventures of agile

00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,760
articulates us in the idea of what he

00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,760
calls the agile onion

00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:47,280
right so at the core of the agile onion

00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,200
you have these tools

00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,040
and processes practices and then it

00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,239
builds up to the values principles and

00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:55,840
mindset

00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:59,200
and you can use almost any organization

00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:01,680
can use agile tools and practices

00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:04,640
but in order to really embrace those

00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,720
principles and values and that mindset

00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:08,480
more change is required at an

00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,959
organizational level

00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,879
right so you know so if your

00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:15,840
organization is run like a machine

00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:16,400
right agile will only take you so far

00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,000
and

00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,680
you know what we found a few years ago

00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,759
this is actually what happened to us

00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,400
right we had adopted agile in our

00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:26,160
development processes but we hadn't made

00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,080
the other changes at the organizational

00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,880
level that were necessary to truly

00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,639
unlock the power of agile you know our

00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,080
team members were resourced to multiple

00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,280
projects at a time which meant they had

00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,680
to do a lot of concept

00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:39,759
context shifting there was a lot of

00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,240
management overhead required

00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:44,320
and the end result it was a negative

00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,919
impact on both productivity and team

00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:49,120
member morale

00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:52,160
and you actually see this

00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,759
uh there's this is a model by a man

00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,280
named frederick lew who

00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:57,919
presents the different models of

00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:01,759
different kinds of organizations

00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:04,160
and he talks about what you can do

00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:04,800
within the different structural models

00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,560
and so

00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,240
you know he starts at the lower left you

00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,440
have your organizations that are very

00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,240
focused around power

00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,199
structure authority formal roles if you

00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,400
think about like

00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:18,880
the military would be a good example uh

00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,720
and then you all have achievement uh

00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,320
based organizations that are

00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,080
you know really think about themselves

00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,639
in terms of uh

00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:28,400
you know doing a lot of work measuring

00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:31,680
things going fast

00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,639
rewarding people based on you know merit

00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,479
achievement or

00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,320
you know productivity or some conception

00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:39,199
thereof if you think about a lot of

00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:41,280
a lot of startup organizations exist in

00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:43,919
this achievement place

00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:45,919
and then you have uh people-centered

00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:46,720
organizations right and so they still

00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:49,120
have

00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,400
a hierarchy but they that they exist

00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,160
within a framework that is really

00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,960
focused around people and i i actually

00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,440
think

00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:57,280
that you know a lot of organizations in

00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:00,560
the drupal ecosystem are really

00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:02,960
very green organizations but then

00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:05,680
he presents this idea of the teal

00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:09,120
organization and the teal organization

00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:12,240
is one that you know has moved from this

00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:14,319
this idea of dependence to or

00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,919
and from independence to an idea of

00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:19,360
interdependence right

00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:22,160
so a teal in a teal organization

00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:24,000
it's more like an organism than where

00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,960
the different parts all work together to

00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,039
support the whole

00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,400
right and the reality is that a

00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:30,400
traditional hierarchy isn't well

00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:32,479
equipped to handle complex problems

00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,160
organizations that are successfully able

00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:35,840
to get to the teal stage

00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,680
are stronger more stable they have

00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:40,160
better results and higher employee

00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:42,720
satisfaction more traditional companies

00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,520
right so as we have gone through our

00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,360
journey i think

00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,199
you know we were at a point where we

00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:50,319
were very much kind of

00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:52,319
you know in between kind of both that

00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:55,680
that orange and green place

00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:57,599
and you know we we made a decision to

00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:00,960
really try and push toward

00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:03,440
a more teal kind of organization

00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,400
so you know one of the ways you can do

00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:07,120
that is

00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:08,880
um as this is there's a movement called

00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,039
modern agile that

00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:12,720
really is focused on applying the agile

00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:14,240
mindset to organizations and they've

00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:17,039
identified

00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:19,120
a set of principles that can help an

00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:22,319
organization really embrace this

00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:24,160
um you know of course the focus on

00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:26,160
people making people awesome

00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,280
making safety a prerequisite and that

00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,880
that's really talking about

00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:31,039
psychological safety

00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:32,960
a place where folks are able to to speak

00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:33,840
up and raise questions and concerns

00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,800
without

00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,360
worrying about negative repercussions

00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,400
where you're

00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:42,800
continually focused on delivering value

00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,080
and where of course you know one of the

00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,120
core parts of agile

00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:49,199
is is experimenting learning rapidly and

00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,639
reintegrating those experiments and that

00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:54,080
learning into

00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:55,440
the uh into the organization so

00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,599
that's a little bit of sort of the

00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:59,039
background in context and now i'm going

00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:01,599
to turn it over to tiffany

00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:05,039
to talk about how we have done this

00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:05,039
within our organization

00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:12,560
so if you decide that you're ready to

00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,520
make this shift from seeing your own

00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,800
organization

00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,280
to as a machine to one that is more like

00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,960
a

00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:21,199
living organism you know where do you

00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,639
start right it's a it is a pretty big

00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:26,319
paradigm shift

00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:28,960
from one that recognizes

00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:31,280
that your organization is more than a

00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:32,959
collection of lines and boxes anytime

00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:36,159
you embark on

00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:36,719
a an organizational redesign it's more

00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,560
than just

00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:40,159
shifting around the post-its on your big

00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:43,680
whiteboard

00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:47,360
this move from a more traditional

00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:49,600
more bureaucratic hierarchical structure

00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:52,080
is a pretty significant one and you know

00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,920
when we started

00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:56,000
even though we were relatively flat

00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:57,519
organization we still did have those

00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,640
silos we had

00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:01,040
um you know our we had our ux team we

00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:04,399
had

00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:06,880
our engineering team we had our ops team

00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:08,720
and um you know and we had a you know a

00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,080
management team above that and then

00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,839
there was you know some

00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:15,120
george and i and you know so that's

00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:17,600
pretty flat but you still kind of had to

00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:19,440
make some pretty significant changes um

00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,760
to

00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,839
evolve our mindset to one that was much

00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:27,440
more cross-functional and

00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:29,200
um to to really shift

00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,480
the organization to being one where

00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,720
leadership is

00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:35,440
um is a construct where we provide

00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:37,279
direction and facilitate action

00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,880
around these kind of cross-functional

00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:40,560
teams that

00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,959
are organized around and and

00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:44,080
accountability that's a very big mindset

00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:46,800
shift

00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:49,279
so acknowledging that when we started on

00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:52,560
this journey in 2018

00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:54,399
we you know

00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,399
didn't start out thinking that we were

00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:59,120
going to become agile we just knew that

00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:00,320
we had for years tried to build out this

00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,959
management tier

00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:04,320
and it hadn't worked like so we we're

00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:06,320
sitting here we're like okay

00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,360
you know what are we gonna do and how

00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,600
are we gonna do it

00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,560
um and so we set out and we said okay

00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,760
well we're gonna

00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,040
we're gonna start and we're gonna sit

00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,640
down and we're gonna we're gonna

00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:17,600
redesign the company

00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:19,040
again and um and what we wanted to do is

00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,399
we wanted to understand and then solve

00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,399
for the root problem

00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:23,839
um and we wanted to design something

00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:26,720
that would work for now

00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:28,160
and that would scale with us um and

00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:31,519
being a huge fan

00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:33,519
of martial arts films like i am

00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:34,640
i am a big fan of bruce lee and so i

00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:35,760
really like this uh

00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,680
quote which i have no idea if it's

00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,360
apocryphal or not but i do love it

00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,800
which is adapt what is useful reject

00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,079
what is useless and add what is

00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,320
specifically our own

00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:45,760
um and it fits with us it fits with open

00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,959
source it fits with kind of our ethos

00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:49,920
which is like look

00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:50,880
if if something exists let's use it if

00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,920
it doesn't fit with us

00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:55,519
let's not use that part and um and let's

00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,360
really only add those

00:10:55,519 --> 00:11:00,000
that secret sauce that is specifically

00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,760
palantirs let's stop trying to

00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,440
rewrite everything and to stop trying to

00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,680
invent everything on our own because we

00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,320
are

00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:07,360
a small company and let's really focus

00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,760
on those things

00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,560
so when we when we sat down we said okay

00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,079
what are the

00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,600
the key questions that we need to solve

00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:15,120
with this redesign and

00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,800
for us it boiled down to three things

00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,880
and these are pretty common to any kind

00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,640
of professional services company

00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,079
the goals you have are you know how do

00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,360
you do good work how do you

00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:25,519
keep your team happy and how do you do

00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,680
it sustainably so for us

00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:28,959
as we sat down to think about it we

00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:31,200
wanted to know how do we deliver

00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:33,760
repeatable value to our clients

00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:36,160
and how can we be a human-centered

00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:38,800
company that wasn't dependent

00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,760
on or designed for any specific person

00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,760
or people

00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,959
perhaps you know this would resonate

00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,880
with you whoever

00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:47,600
have been in an organization or perhaps

00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:50,720
or an organization now that relies on

00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,200
individual heroics to be successful um

00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,600
and then

00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,720
how do we better support our team so

00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,279
that's what we really kind of

00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:59,600
we're focused on and as we sat down to

00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:01,680
understand the root causes of what had

00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:04,320
you know why we were in the situation we

00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:07,120
were at what we realized is that our

00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:09,120
engagements were largely transactional

00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,000
and they had this kind of asymmetrical

00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,720
understanding

00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,600
of the value that we were delivering

00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,480
that are

00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,360
there was such an expectation um

00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,440
disconnect

00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,800
um that there you know whether we were

00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,920
collaborating or whether we were just

00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,800
engaging

00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:26,720
and then also that there was internally

00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,440
this kind of inconsistent experience due

00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,600
to

00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,519
a lack of clarity in the roles that we

00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:34,399
had um you know we were definitely

00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:35,839
you know doing agile um on our project

00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:39,200
teams but

00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:41,440
you know whether we um were faithful

00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:43,200
to um you know to agile was it was you

00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,079
know we were literally agile not big

00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:47,120
agile

00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:48,959
if that means anything to you so um as

00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,760
we sat down to kind of think about how

00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:52,000
how might we be different moving forward

00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,320
we

00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,720
fairly quickly realized that on both a

00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,959
tactical and a strategic level

00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:01,120
that embracing agile would help us

00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:03,360
address all three of those questions

00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,639
so we were able to simplify it down to

00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,360
one big question

00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:07,680
which is okay how does palantir become

00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,880
an

00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:12,000
agile organization um and so to do this

00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:14,560
we needed to adopt

00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,279
and adapt our strategy our structure our

00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,079
processes

00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:20,240
our people and um you know to a lesser

00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:22,480
extent even our technology

00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,920
toward this kind of new operating model

00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,639
and it would take a lot of mindset

00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,880
shifts

00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:28,560
while we were all still running this you

00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,800
know pretty small business

00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,680
so this is the story of how we've done

00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,320
it so far

00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:36,000
and where we are now as well as what we

00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:38,240
see ahead

00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,240
so as we started in 2018 it was in the

00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,959
second half of 2018

00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,279
we kind of identified this north star so

00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:45,360
so

00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:47,440
the latter half of 2018 we really said

00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,279
okay what are we looking to do

00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,800
and we came up with three objectives

00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:52,240
that what we needed to do is we needed

00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,199
to be disciplined in how we worked with

00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,880
each other

00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:56,880
flexible in how we worked with our

00:13:54,880 --> 00:14:00,000
clients and have everything be

00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:01,360
optimized for focus and flow so those

00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,639
were the three big things that we were

00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,920
looking at doing

00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:05,839
and what this did is it gave us this

00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,959
kind of sense of shared purpose it gave

00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:08,399
us a mission

00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:11,120
and a vision that we could kind of

00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:13,519
organize around and we used that

00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:15,760
those three areas as these big strategic

00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:17,600
signposts for where we were going

00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:20,240
specifically this notion of focus and

00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:23,680
flow as george talked about earlier

00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:26,880
the context shifting was was brutal

00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:29,920
and this really became the rallying cry

00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:30,959
as we moved forward into 2019 to have

00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:33,279
our team

00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:34,720
really focused around halves and holes

00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:36,639
and our business ever since has really

00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,160
been organized around this notion of of

00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:41,199
haves and holes

00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:43,680
half time or full time and

00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:44,399
that's been pretty key for us and we

00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:47,760
started

00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:50,720
um in at the end of 2018

00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,920
working on the reframing of the mindsets

00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,360
um

00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:55,519
up until this point even though as

00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:57,440
george mentioned we've been running the

00:14:55,519 --> 00:15:00,480
company for a really long time

00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:02,000
we um had not really been clear with

00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,880
ourselves or with others

00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,160
um what kind of a firm we were um were

00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:08,160
we a software firm

00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:09,440
uh were we an open source you know

00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:12,480
software firm were we

00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:14,079
an agency where we a consultancy and and

00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,639
we were actually started to be very very

00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:17,760
clear

00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:19,600
um both internally and externally about

00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:21,600
what kind of firm we were we are a

00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,560
digital consultancy we do see ourselves

00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:25,040
that way

00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:27,920
and and provide this kind of clarity in

00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:29,600
how we deliver that end to end value

00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:31,120
in each of our service lines in each of

00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:34,800
our

00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:36,959
in each of our value streams so

00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,920
with that we started to focus on that

00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:39,920
vision and

00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:41,199
not just the vision of the work we do

00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:43,199
and the value that we deliver

00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:44,800
but also this vision of the company it

00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:46,639
wasn't about

00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:48,560
getting better at doing management it

00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:49,759
was actually about embedding leadership

00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:52,399
at all levels

00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:53,120
and that we wanted to pursue this notion

00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:55,839
of

00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:57,120
a mesh of a networked organizational

00:15:55,839 --> 00:16:00,320
structure

00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:01,360
that embedded servant leadership from

00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:05,279
all of us

00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:07,680
and where we could focus on delivering

00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:09,680
value and benefiting from greater

00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,000
agility and so with that we said okay

00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,240
now

00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,240
as we start to look at all of the

00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:16,399
different parts of our organization

00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,920
what's this blueprint how does this the

00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:18,800
structure how does the process and how

00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,560
do the people

00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,880
um how might they need to start to

00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:25,440
evolve and and how would um

00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:26,320
how would we go about doing that and the

00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,720
uh

00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,360
the interesting thing is we were totally

00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,399
wrong we

00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:34,720
totally underestimated how

00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:35,519
long any of that would take and we

00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,800
weren't yet

00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:40,160
agile so um one of the i talked about

00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,639
this in the retrospective part of this

00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:43,759
talk

00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:46,079
um you know it was interesting to see um

00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:47,120
you know just how unagile we were going

00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:50,480
about trying to become

00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:52,399
agile um so i don't regret it um and uh

00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:55,120
but i do wish that we had known we

00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:56,000
we know now um so the initial resistance

00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,519
of course um

00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,199
was that you know we're not a product

00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:01,199
company how can we do this

00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:02,639
um our teams aren't long-lived enough

00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:05,360
because you know we do

00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:07,039
work on our projects length of you know

00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:08,959
four to nine months

00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:11,280
how could we possibly do this people are

00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:12,720
on you know two projects sometimes at a

00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,799
time

00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:17,839
agile is designed for in-person teams

00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:21,600
and we are our remote first company and

00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:24,000
actually since 2016 we've been

00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:25,360
pretty much everyone works remote um and

00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,400
oh my gosh you want to do what with

00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:28,559
budgeting

00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,320
um so you know ultimately we were able

00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:32,320
to overcome each of these resistances

00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,679
right um so in terms of you know not a

00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:36,400
product company we

00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:38,720
um it requires coaching and buy-in from

00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:41,600
both the internal and the client teams

00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:43,200
and you know our the fact that our our

00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:46,080
teams aren't long-lived enough we

00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,600
focus on cultural coherence to overcome

00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,200
that the fact that agile

00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:51,120
isn't designed for in-person teams i

00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:53,919
think all of us now um

00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:55,440
you know in the pandemic understand how

00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:57,120
you deal with that you think about the

00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,559
purpose and the objective of each of the

00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:01,760
ceremonies and consider

00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:04,080
how you meet those in a remote context

00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:05,919
but we had decided of course that one of

00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,880
the most important agile shifts um was

00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:09,360
from

00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:11,280
authority to influence and so what that

00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:13,919
meant is that even though

00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,320
we had decided george and i were on

00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:15,440
board

00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:17,360
yes we're going to go in this agile

00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,960
direction that at every step

00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,960
um every time we were making one of

00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,880
these shifts we needed to reinforce

00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:24,960
those changes that we were making

00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:26,080
by role modeling we needed to do skill

00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,559
building we needed

00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:29,919
to make sure that we were explaining why

00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:31,520
what we were doing was important we

00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:32,240
needed to build that understanding among

00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:34,559
the team

00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:36,320
and we needed to reinforce it with

00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:38,720
making sure that there was policy

00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:39,520
alignment at every step so then you move

00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,679
forward into

00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:43,039
into 2019 which is where we really

00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:44,240
started to do the piloting and the

00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:46,080
embedding of the work

00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:48,080
so on the structural front we started to

00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,600
evolve the reporting structure into a

00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:51,440
support structure

00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:53,039
so we created the people and

00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,320
organizational development units which

00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:55,120
i'll talk about a little bit more about

00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:59,200
in a second

00:18:55,120 --> 00:19:01,760
comes out of this notion that

00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:03,280
that you really don't report to a single

00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,480
person there is no hierarchy so what

00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:06,720
does that look like in

00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,840
a network structure we created chapters

00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,320
for each discipline so if you're

00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:12,080
familiar with a more matrix structure

00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:13,520
that's what that looks like and

00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,559
obviously the project teams became the

00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,799
building block for

00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:18,080
learning and development within palantir

00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:20,160
and

00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,280
we tried to pilot guilds which were kind

00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:24,720
of

00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:28,160
self-organized cross-functional

00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:30,000
uh groupings for a single

00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,440
interest those didn't last long because

00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,640
we're really small and we're working on

00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,160
stuff all the time

00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,679
so that's a spoiler alert but so what

00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:37,360
are these pods um

00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:39,360
so pods were one of the structures we

00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,880
were iterating on was the professional

00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,840
and organizational development team or

00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,600
the pod

00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:45,039
the idea was that every team member had

00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:47,520
a dedicated team who provide

00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:49,039
facilitation collaboration and coaching

00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,240
around an individual's performance

00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:52,080
growth and development goals and

00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:53,760
included a representative from their

00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,600
chapter or discipline someone who was

00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:58,240
thinking about their

00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:59,200
their experience as a team member here

00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,720
at palantir

00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:04,159
as well as somebody who is thinking

00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:06,320
about the company how they

00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:07,520
contribute to our success as an

00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,360
organization

00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:11,200
um and they have multiple lenses so the

00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:13,200
pods meet both as a group and then one

00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:16,720
on one the experienced team member work

00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:18,400
uh meets with the um each person um

00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:20,000
you know roughly every two to three

00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:23,440
weeks and then they meet

00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,360
as a group a couple times a quarter

00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,799
and so we found that this kind of team

00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,400
approach helps promote

00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:30,159
very open and honest and meaningful

00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,440
discussions because his team members

00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:33,760
know that their career path at the

00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:36,960
company isn't dependent on any single

00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:36,960
individual or manager

00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:41,200
so then on the people side one of the

00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:42,720
first things we did is we leveled

00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,000
salaries we felt it was important that

00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,919
we had equal pay for equal

00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,960
responsibilities so we have 16 different

00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:50,400
pay levels

00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:52,480
you also can opt for increased

00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,080
pto time if that's something you want

00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:56,080
and then we also

00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:57,520
this year we implemented a new downshift

00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:00,640
for those who want

00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:04,080
um to be able to to just routinely be at

00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:05,600
75 percent um schedule because you

00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,080
either have child care responsibilities

00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,520
or

00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:09,760
elder care or you just want more

00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:10,159
sunshine in your life um so that's a new

00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:13,280
thing

00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:14,880
uh pto is personal time off thank you um

00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:16,240
and then we had a roll base structure so

00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,039
one of the things about agile is that

00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,280
you don't

00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:20,880
um you know when you you want to be able

00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,520
to take the role that is essential to

00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,000
you

00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:25,360
but then that if you change your role

00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,919
depending what the needs of the project

00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,919
are

00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:29,360
how do you define in a non-hierarchical

00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:30,240
team how do you define your career

00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,600
advancement

00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,440
so that becomes something that we had to

00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:35,600
define as well

00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:37,200
in the process as part of it and that

00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,400
comes up in our rbs

00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:41,120
rubric which i'll talk a little bit

00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:42,960
about and then we also had to support

00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:44,000
this with a considerable amount of

00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,760
training both at the

00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,760
group and the individual level

00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,400
fortunately we were able to to provide a

00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,559
lot of

00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:52,320
i get a lot of support from folks like

00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:54,240
richard kasparovsky adventures with

00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:56,960
agile michael sohoda

00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:59,840
we brought in a lot of agile partners

00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,840
here to help us

00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:04,080
on the process side we made the shift to

00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:07,280
half and hole

00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:08,480
time resourcing and billing we did a

00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:10,480
shift from

00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:11,919
documentation over into playbooks the

00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:13,200
difference here is that instead of

00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:16,480
saying this is how

00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:18,320
we do it we started to talk about um

00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,760
plays like these are the questions

00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:22,080
you'll want to ask

00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:23,760
and and answer for yourself as a team

00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,720
since agile teams control their way of

00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,720
working

00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,159
when you're in this scenario these are

00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,280
the kinds of questions that you'll want

00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:32,159
to ask yourself

00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:33,679
and then practices become this is a way

00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:35,039
that you might consider solving it so

00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:37,200
there might be multiple practices that

00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:39,039
are appropriate in a given situation

00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,640
we started to roll out a decision-making

00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:42,240
framework that talks about the different

00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:45,520
types of decisions that are made at

00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:47,679
palantir and who gets to

00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,720
you know who what what level of decision

00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:51,200
is appropriate

00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,880
because the person who is appropriate to

00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,640
make given decision is a person who is

00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:56,559
closest to the decision who has both the

00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:58,000
context a sense of the big picture

00:22:56,559 --> 00:23:00,080
and an understanding of the day-to-day

00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,000
operations for it so we talked about

00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:03,600
leaf level decisions which are personal

00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,880
decisions branch level decisions which

00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,400
are team level decisions

00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:08,240
trunk level decisions which are

00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:11,440
decisions that impact

00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:13,039
um you know multiple branches multiple

00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:14,000
projects and then root level decisions

00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:15,840
which affect

00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,559
the company as a whole and then we

00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:20,080
started to work on the rbs rubric

00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:22,000
and so i can talk a little bit more

00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:25,120
about that when we talk about rolling

00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:28,559
that out so then we hit 2020 so

00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:28,880
2020 is obviously our our pandemic year

00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:30,480
but

00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:32,159
for the most part we we went into the

00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,880
year understanding it was a year for us

00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:35,760
to iterate

00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,080
and improve and as you you start to

00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,559
think

00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,600
about that uh we iterated on our pods um

00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:40,880
so you start with now

00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,720
any time you iterate in an agile

00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:44,400
organization you start with now you

00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:46,080
define an experiment and you

00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,919
do some research and then you test it

00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:49,279
and roll it back out um so we did that

00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:50,000
with the pods our initial roll rollout

00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:52,400
of the pod actually

00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,039
had three people and then we realized

00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,240
that

00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:56,320
you know that was just we didn't

00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:58,000
actually have enough people to have

00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:00,559
three pod representatives for each

00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,480
person we were all um

00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:04,000
exhausted we couldn't do justice to it

00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:06,159
in that kind of form and so that's the

00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,760
way we actually reduced it down to two

00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:10,240
pod members per

00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,960
um you know per pod and that's actually

00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,960
been fine

00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:14,720
um well three pod members total because

00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,840
you have the person the team member

00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,000
right the team member is the third

00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,799
person of the pod yeah correct yeah so

00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,919
that actually

00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:24,960
worked out well um and then um we were

00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:28,080
able to to kind of iterate in on that

00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:29,919
um so then we also provided some some

00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:31,120
more clarity around the pot shifting

00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:34,080
more toward coaching

00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:34,960
and empowerment less directing at that

00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,960
place

00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:38,159
we started to roll out the career path

00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,480
developments in

00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:42,080
individual learning plans per person and

00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,679
then the chapters started to become more

00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,400
self-managed they reorganized a little

00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:46,880
bit

00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,840
when we first seeded the chapters uh the

00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,360
chapters uh we

00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:51,360
provided a suggestion of like what the

00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:52,559
chapter should be um and so then the

00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:55,360
chapters um

00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:56,400
changed some they got together which

00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:58,000
chapter people were in

00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,279
um they got to choose which chapters

00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,760
they wanted to be in they changed the

00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:04,880
topics around the chapters

00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:06,640
and in that way so and then in terms of

00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:09,039
the structures in the in the process

00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:10,559
the pods became more outcome focused and

00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:13,440
reduced to two members

00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:14,960
uh the guilds were self-organized by

00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,159
interest and the chapters were really

00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,440
around disciplines

00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:19,679
so these are the discipline based the

00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:21,120
guilds um kind of dropped off because

00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:22,799
we just didn't have enough time in the

00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:24,640
day to do that

00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:26,000
um a lot of a lot of the topics the

00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:27,840
guilds were discussing

00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,080
i think ended up being integrated into

00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:32,480
the chapter conversations so

00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:33,600
yeah or they became um just sort of

00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:36,320
people use their prof

00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,640
time to do work on them individually um

00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:40,240
or

00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:42,400
as a an internal project so then we also

00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:43,520
were able to roll out our rbs rubric

00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,960
pilot and

00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:46,320
that tool started to roll out so i've

00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,600
talked about that a little bit so what

00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:50,960
happens is

00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:52,960
if you are in a matrix organization and

00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:54,159
your there is no hierarchy either in

00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:57,200
your project team or

00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:58,400
in your um or based on the role that

00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:01,840
you're playing on a project

00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:03,840
how do you define career advancement and

00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:05,360
and so what we did is we actually took

00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:08,240
some uh

00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:09,440
our lead from education so in education

00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:11,600
rubric is

00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:13,200
this kind of multi-dimensional set of

00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,799
scoring guidelines it can be used to

00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,960
provide consistency

00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:19,200
in evaluating progress so the idea is

00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:20,960
like you don't have the same people in

00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,919
all these pods we couldn't possibly do

00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,480
that so there's a lot of different

00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:23,760
people

00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:25,440
but we want to be able to provide a

00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:26,720
consistent experience around measuring

00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:28,880
progress because

00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:29,840
your level is tied to your salary and we

00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,760
have a published

00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:33,520
salary schedule so people want to know

00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:35,440
how do i advance how do i continue to

00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:36,240
add depth to my career how do i continue

00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:39,200
to move forward

00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:41,039
how do i get a raise so the rbs

00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,679
structure and the rbs rubric is about

00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:43,760
that

00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:45,039
and so what it does is it provides this

00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,799
kind of authentic

00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:48,080
decentralized assessment that is

00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:50,080
employee driven and

00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:51,360
employee driven career development but

00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:53,120
but also

00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:55,120
you're involved in that assessment

00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:56,720
process because team members are now

00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:58,720
taking an active role

00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:01,039
in their career advancement in

00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:03,120
self-evaluation and in goal setting

00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:04,559
and so now there's a much stronger

00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:06,480
validity

00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:07,840
around that the self-assessment is or

00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:11,279
that the assessment in general

00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:12,799
is both accurately um measuring their

00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:14,320
learning and their progress

00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:16,559
and then there's a lot more alignment

00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:18,159
between what you the each team member's

00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:20,399
interested in and then also the

00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:22,399
the way that the company um can benefit

00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:24,080
from that

00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:25,600
so as i mentioned here last year was the

00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:28,080
pandemic year and um

00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:29,840
one of the ways that i knew that or i i

00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:31,200
can measure that that we've been being

00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:33,760
successful with this is that we

00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:35,919
we rolled out what we called our code

00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,720
name armadillo which was our individual

00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:39,360
project for

00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:40,799
resolve and resilience as a company so

00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:43,520
last year was a year where we really

00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:46,000
needed organizational agility if ever

00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:48,159
and so as a as a company we committed to

00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:51,120
salary continuity position preservation

00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:52,559
and policy innovation and so because our

00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:54,880
project teams have the clarity the

00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:56,399
transparency and the direction

00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:58,159
as well as the autonomy to take care of

00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:59,840
each other and the clients

00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:02,000
george and i were able to really focus

00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:04,559
on preserving the company and we were

00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,840
fine and in addition to that we were

00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:07,760
able to do

00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:09,679
to run kind of experiments we were able

00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:12,240
to do some flow to work

00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:13,360
so that early in february i was able to

00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:15,279
assemble a team

00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:17,440
which we called our c19 project to

00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:18,640
prepare i was worried about the pandemic

00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:20,320
coming in and so i

00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:22,320
said hey can some people help me start

00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:24,159
to think through what this might mean

00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:26,880
for us and they did and then

00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:28,880
in the third quarter i said hey let's do

00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:30,320
some scenario planning

00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,760
around this and see what we might want

00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:33,200
to be thinking about as we start to

00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,080
think about how we might emerge from

00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,840
this

00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:37,840
and some folks came and we did some some

00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:39,360
cool scenario planning around it

00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:41,840
so we were still able to kind of build

00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:43,279
up our stamina as an organization

00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:44,799
but we did that because we were able to

00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:45,840
say you know what we're just going to

00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:47,840
slow it down

00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:49,360
we are we know that this year we're not

00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:50,720
really going to do sales and marketing

00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,919
nobody's going to do sales and marketing

00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:53,279
we are just going to we are going to

00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:54,720
protect and preserve

00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:56,320
the clients that we have and the team

00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,679
members that we have so we're not going

00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,000
to do any recruiting we are not going to

00:28:57,679 --> 00:28:59,360
do any

00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,320
onboarding we're not going to do much

00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,840
sales or we're not going to do much

00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,399
marketing we are just going to take care

00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,480
of

00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:05,840
the clients and the people that we have

00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:07,360
and so that was what

00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:09,200
that why we did called it codenamed

00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:10,799
ridilo

00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:12,480
so this year is all about our backbone

00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:14,000
transformation so this is where

00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,600
what needs to happen before we start to

00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,520
scale so we need to

00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:19,360
be focused on rewiring the systems

00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:20,559
organizationally to support that agility

00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:22,399
that we've discovered

00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:23,679
and to build the capabilities required

00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:25,200
to sustain that

00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:26,720
organizational agility otherwise you're

00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,240
going to burn out

00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:30,640
and burn out people and burn out the

00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:32,320
company by going so fast so where we are

00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:33,600
now is we have cross-functional delivery

00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:35,600
teams that

00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:37,200
focus on serving our clients we have

00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,880
self-managed teams for those kind of

00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,240
base load activities like sales and

00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,200
marketing or like thinking about our

00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:43,039
service lines

00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:45,120
and then we have flow to work pools um

00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:46,720
so right you may be familiar with our

00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,919
rector work last year that was a flow to

00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,120
work pool because we had some

00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:51,600
availability

00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:52,640
and they were able to work on that or um

00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:55,039
oops sorry

00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:56,159
um or even the rbs rubric ambassadors as

00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:56,640
we've been rolling that out that's a

00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:58,559
floater

00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:00,399
pool as well just a need that has kind

00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:02,240
of come up um

00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:03,679
so what's next for us we'll do some more

00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,520
blueprinting although this time it'll be

00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:07,200
a more participatory process people had

00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,600
inputs into it last time but i expect it

00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:10,159
to be

00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:11,840
more more voices actually in the room

00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:13,600
doing the blueprinting

00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:15,200
we'll be democratizing our decision

00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:16,880
making and the information necessary to

00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:19,440
participate in more of those decisions

00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:21,120
more types of decisions um we'll be

00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:22,080
investing in our capacity building

00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,600
around

00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:25,919
especially around coaching because

00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:27,600
that's a big thing you need to invest in

00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:28,880
and then maturing all those kind of core

00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:30,320
processes we call them our trunk

00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:32,640
processes

00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:34,159
oops sorry and then we're doing high

00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:37,200
level road mapping

00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:39,919
as well so in terms of retrospective

00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:41,840
uh what we've liked uh mindset shifts

00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:42,720
around um the shift from management to

00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,640
leadership

00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:46,159
scarcity to abundance that's been really

00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,600
helpful um

00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:50,640
having the right partner is very

00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:52,640
important in terms of what we learned

00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:54,000
people over process is really hard when

00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:55,520
people are busy so

00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,679
we've been doing this while we've been

00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:59,679
doing all the other things

00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:01,919
there's certainly an ongoing tension

00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:03,919
between local autonomy of teams so

00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:05,440
teams controlling their way of working

00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:07,120
but then also having the necessary big

00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:09,120
picture strategic view so there's just

00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:11,200
an inherent tension when you move toward

00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:13,200
organizational agility in those two

00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:14,799
areas and i don't have a good area a way

00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:17,360
of resolving that yet

00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:18,000
what we've lacked is rollout support

00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,919
communication

00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,679
is always going to be a challenge it's

00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:23,360
hard to make change smaller and more

00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:26,559
incremental when you're moving

00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:28,080
toward organizational agility and agile

00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:28,640
planning when you've never done it or

00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:31,840
seen it

00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:33,360
is can be hard and what we've longed for

00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:35,440
which i started earlier

00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:37,840
visibility of system status especially

00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:39,440
in a fully remote context is hard

00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:41,600
experiments knowing what experiments are

00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:43,200
in progress can be hard

00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,720
um the balance between the balcony and

00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:46,559
the dance floor views

00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:47,760
between the strategic and the tactical

00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:49,919
is what that means

00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:51,360
um having role models people who have

00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:53,360
done this communities of practice

00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:55,120
between at the organizational level

00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:56,720
particularly at our size

00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:58,159
um is something that i really would love

00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:00,720
to do more of which is why

00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:01,840
i've done this talk so i'm curious to

00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:04,480
