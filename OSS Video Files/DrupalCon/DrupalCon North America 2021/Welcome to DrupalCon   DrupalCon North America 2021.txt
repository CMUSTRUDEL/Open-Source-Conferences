excited for the opportunity to come

00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,640
together as a community

00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,840
and we hope that you use this week to

00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,680
learn build and connect with one another

00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,760
the drupal association is the official

00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,600
host of drupalcon but obviously it

00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:01,199
wouldn't be possible without the support

00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,079
from our generous sponsors and an

00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:05,119
amazing team

00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:07,040
of contributors this year over half of

00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:09,040
the contributors supporting drupalcon

00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,000
programming and summits are actually new

00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,000
to the team

00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,760
and for quite a few this is their first

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,759
official contribution to the drupal

00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:18,320
project so congratulations

to all of you with your first contrib to

00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,280
drupal

00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,880
so let's take a moment to recognize

00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:26,720
these drupalcon contributors

00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,799
and in fact since all of you are active

00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,479
in chat give them some drupal thanks

00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,400
for all their hard work leading up to

00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:35,119
this event

00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,600
also new in 2021 we established the

00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:37,119
first

00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,200
marketing and outreach committee for

00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:41,119
drupalcon and actually did that in

00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,880
collaboration with the promote drupal

00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:44,240
initiative so thank you suzanne for

00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,600
running promote drupal

00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,119
and thank you to everybody on the

00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,439
marketing and outreach committee that

00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:51,520
helped get the word out about drupalcon

00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:54,000
and you must have done a great job

00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:55,840
because almost a third of our attendees

00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,280
are brand new to drupalcon this is their

00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,799
first time to attend so that is amazing

00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,719
this year we asked each of the

00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:04,000
initiative teams to collaborate with our

00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:05,680
drupalcon team

00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,640
to help us support the community's

00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:10,879
ability to get involved in contribution

00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,800
so thank you to these teams as well we

00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:14,959
know it took a little bit of extra work

00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,640
to get ready for this week we appreciate

00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:17,440
you being willing to help us take an

00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,440
idea

00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,200
and turn it into reality at drupalcon

00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,800
this week

00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,800
and you'll hear a little more from dries

00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,640
in just a bit about these initiatives

00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,599
and how they're actually integrated into

00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,640
the drupalcon

00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:32,959
week's programming so of course we have

00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,879
to thank our drupalcon sponsors we truly

00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:36,800
appreciate your ongoing support of the

00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:38,319
drupal project and of our drupal

00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,000
community

00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:42,000
so thank you for sticking with us for

00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,840
yet another virtual event

00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,680
uh it was wonderful to be able to keep

00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,720
our community safe and yet be able to

00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,640
get together

00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,080
and all of you that sponsored this event

00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,519
made that happen

00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,280
um you're going to hear a little more

00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:55,120
during the week but the other great

00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,680
thing about being virtual

00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:00,000
in addition to a lot of new attendees

00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,800
and the ability for folks to not have to

00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,120
travel

00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,080
is we've got over 150 scholarship

00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,440
attendees that are

00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,599
they're going to be here this week and

00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:09,120
quite a few students and

00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:11,760
young professionals so be sure to

00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,840
welcome them into our drupal community

00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,120
and speaking of make sure you spend some

00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,120
time exploring the

00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,800
expo hall so that's where our sponsors

00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,159
will be hanging out this week

00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,159
go say hi to them they're going to be

00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:24,319
hosting activities and even giving away

00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:26,159
some prizes

00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:27,760
so this year we actually created a new

00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:29,680
sponsorship category

00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,519
and that's for individual sponsors so

00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:34,080
thank you to those that saw something

00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:35,760
new and actually took us up on it

00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,840
you gave a little bit extra to support

00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,920
this event and in turn support our

00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:42,159
community's ability to get together and

00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,599
to collaborate so thank you

00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:45,200
and there is one more round of thank

00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:47,120
yous that i need to do today

00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:49,200
so funding from our supporting partners

00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:51,280
is critical and enabling all the work we

00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,720
do as an association that's not related

00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,879
to drupalcon

00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,640
so that includes things like supporting

00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:58,720
development of drupal 9 getting ready

00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:01,280
for drupal 10 which if you can believe

00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,799
is just around the corner we also

00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,519
maintain drupal.org

00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:06,959
it helps us fund infrastructure it helps

00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:09,519
us fund testing

00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:11,360
it helps us keep a healthy community by

00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:12,400
emphasizing diversity equity and

00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,319
inclusion

00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,239
we're working to enable contribution

00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:18,639
even better and to expand the kind of

00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:21,040
contribution that is recognized

00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:22,880
we work with community groups including

00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,440
the security working group to help keep

00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,680
the site

00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:28,080
safe so thank you to all of these

00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:32,160
supporting partners that make that work

00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:34,080
possible much of our work wouldn't be

00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,759
possible without that ongoing support

00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,199
and i want to give them one more thank

00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:40,880
you

00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:42,560
so let's dive into drupalcon so here are

00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,800
some ways that you can get the most out

00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:47,280
of your drupalcon experience this week

00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,960
so if you haven't yet the first best

00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,240
thing to do is to take a look at the

00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,680
program agenda

00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,520
make sure you know where you want to be

00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,199
and when this week and you can plan out

00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,880
your activities

00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:58,479
be sure to go to the expo hall as i

00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,160
mentioned earlier you get to talk to

00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:01,120
thought leaders participate in fun

00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,280
activities

00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,440
did i mention prizes everybody likes

00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:08,000
prizes so go get some prizes

00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:09,360
um make sure to use it use the chat so a

00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,880
lot of you are using the chat and

00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,039
hopping this morning in the reception

00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,639
area and now on the main stage

00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:16,320
but make sure to use the chat within the

00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:17,919
sessions as well that's our best way to

00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,680
connect and collaborate while we're here

00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:22,160
at drupalcon

00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,840
and this year we have a hallway track so

00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,560
i know that what people miss is the

00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,240
connection

00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,160
of stopping in the hall and getting to

00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,160
say hi so we've recreated that with help

00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,680
from 1x internet as our sponsor for the

00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,360
hallway track

00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,199
up to six participants will be in the

00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,960
hallway track at any time

00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:38,960
so it'll feel like bumping into friends

00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:41,360
uh in our traditional venue

00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,560
and if six people's too much we've got

00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,080
some one-on-one

00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,759
so it goes either way either you love

00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,520
the one-on-one or you hate it so you've

00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:48,880
got two options to connect with people

00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,560
but if you want to try the one-on-one

00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,320
networking feature you'll be randomly

00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,400
paired with another attendee

00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:56,080
uh this dries i know was in there

00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,280
several times last year and probably

00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,120
will be again this year

00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,560
um so there's a lot of fun it was a lot

00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,400
of fun and we saw some fun

00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,000
twitter pics of people that got to hang

00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,039
out with you in the in the networking so

00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,479
i hope that everybody will take

00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:08,080
advantage of that again

00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:10,240
of course we've got buffs which take

00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:12,880
place this time in the expo hall

00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,639
um fun events social events like

00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,880
drupalcon trivia

00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:18,880
and if you do miss a session because all

00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:21,280
those things are happening

00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,960
you will get to see those later so

00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,639
everything's being recorded or at least

00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,440
the sessions are being recorded you'll

00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:26,880
get to

00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,560
look at those you'll log into your

00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,800
drupalcon vimeo account

00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,880

we're targeting to have those up and

00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:40,160
running within 24 hours after the

00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,919
session so that way

and of course psychological safety is a

00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,880
crucial element of a healthy community

00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:52,800
and our drupal con code of conduct is

00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,880

so instead of uh contribution being

00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,000
mainly focused on friday we've spread it

out throughout the week and linked it to

00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,759

community that i think we can really

00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:43,199
scale and grow over time as well

00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,960
so with that i would love dries for you

00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:45,520

focus

00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:50,240
on drupal strategic initiatives and why

00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:53,039
they matter so much for the project

00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:54,879

00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,400
the drupal association like putting a

00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:03,440
drupal con together is

00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:04,800
it's a lot of work and uh it takes

00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:08,160
months and months

00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:10,879
of work so um thank you everyone for

00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,080
uh helping to make this happen so yeah

00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:14,639
i'm happy to talk a little bit more

00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:16,400
about what we're doing uh this week uh

00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:18,560
because in addition to

00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:20,319
sort of the traditional content the

00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,919
sessions where you can learn about all

00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:25,440
things drupal

00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:29,759
we've also decided to have a focus on

00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:31,360
drupal's strategic initiatives and

00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,880
i've talked about these strategic

00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,360
initiatives in

00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,479
previews uh drupal cons and i'll talk

00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,719
about them

00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,560
later this week as well but the

00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,959
strategic initiatives are really like

00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:42,719
five

00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:44,000
things the five most important things

00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:47,279
that we need to do

00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:50,480
uh to make drupal 10 a huge success

00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:53,200
right and to help us maintain and extend

00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,320
our leadership role uh in in serve the

00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,320
world

00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,240
and so we wanted to do something new and

00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,640
that's the initiative days

00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,279
uh you can see them on the screen here

00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:04,800
um

00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:08,640
they're essentially days dedicated to

00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:10,640
uh these strategic initiatives um and so

00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,320
you'll see they'll run from tuesday to

00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,000
friday and uh

00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,920
there's kind of a pattern i guess to

00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,560
each of the days where we start with an

00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:19,120
initiative

00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:21,200
keynote it's like 30 minutes presented

00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,080
by the initiative lead so the people are

00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:25,279
actually

00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:27,839
driving this initiative so no better

00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:29,040
group of people to learn about these

00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:31,360
initiatives

00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,160
from than those people i'll talk about

00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:35,200
their goals

00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:37,680
why the initiative is important

00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,279
the status of the initiative uh how you

00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:42,959
can help with the initiative

00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:44,240
etc etc and then um

00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:46,000
you know later in the day you'll

00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:49,120
actually be invited

00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,800
to become an active contributor to

00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,640
each of these initiatives you know help

00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,560
you or help us build

00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:56,800
a drupal and so that's kind of a big

00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,760
deal and so in a way to think about it

00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:01,279
is that these

00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:03,040
days are kind of divided into parts

00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:04,720
you know learning about the initiative

00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:07,360
as well as contributing

00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,920
to the initiative and so the mission

00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,200
really

00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:13,200
of those initiative days um is i guess

00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,600
also twofold which is one

00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,200
to advance these strategic initiatives

00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:20,079
and to make drupal

00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,440
even more successful but also as a

00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:24,240
second goal is to get

00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,920
new people uh to contribute to drupal i

00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,440
mean we love getting new contributors

00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,279
it's the strategic

00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:31,120
goal of us and the drupal association

00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:32,079
i'm sure header will talk about that

00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,079
more but

00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:35,839
um you know it's really these two things

00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:36,320
that we want to achieve and hopefully we

00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:40,240
can be

00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:42,959
successful um you know in both right

00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,600
and if you haven't contributed to drupal

00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:46,240
before

00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:48,079
which i'm sure is a lot of you because

00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,000
you know first of all heather mentioned

00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:51,760
a third of the people in attendance are

00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,040
new to drupal imagine

00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:56,399
maybe fewer people um

00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,839
you know or more people i guess

00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:01,360
depending on how you phrase it have

00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:03,200
never contributed to drupal

00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,800
and so if you haven't contributed yet

00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,880
which again might be

00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,560
quite a few of you i'm sure many of you

00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:10,800
are wondering well i don't

00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:12,480
think i know enough to contribute or how

00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:15,200
do i even start

00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,980
is this for me this contributing part

00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,160
and the answer is absolutely yes

00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:21,360
[Music]

00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:22,320
each of us can add value to these

00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,040
initiatives

00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,680
each of us can make a difference whether

00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:29,040
it's through

00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:29,440
code whether it's by helping us test or

00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,680
write

00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,600
documentation or help with project

00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:36,720
management or design

00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,519
we really can use every talent to make

00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,680
these

00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:41,519
initiatives successful and we're going

00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,000
to help you become a contributor this

00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:43,600
week

00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,279
and so it should be very exciting

00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,000
hopefully you can all go home this week

00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:48,320
saying

00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,720
i'm now an active contributor to drupal

00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:53,120
10 i've helped make drupal 10 better

00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,399
we're going to help you do that and and

00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,360
obviously it's going to benefit the

00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:58,399
project so

00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,720
i'm very excited about these uh days uh

initiative days it's something new i

00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:06,079

00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:08,959
i hope we can learn from this and uh

00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:10,320
you know hopefully also like three years

00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:12,320

will be recognized as top contributors

00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:20,000
to drupal in general i mean that would

00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:22,639
be my definition
