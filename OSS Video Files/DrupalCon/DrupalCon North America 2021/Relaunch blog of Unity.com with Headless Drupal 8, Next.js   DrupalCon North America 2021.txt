Publication date: 2021-05-27
Playlist: DrupalCon North America 2021
Description: 
	After many years of successfully running an interactive blog in 9 different languages using Wordpress, Unity decided to relaunch the blog using headless Drupal and Next.js. The goal was to build a state of the art blogging system that provides a state of the art editorial experience for the team and contributors of the blog and to decouple the frontend completely from the backend.

and been in the drupal community as some

00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,760
of you hurt for roughly

00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,879
just over 14 years now it's amazing to

00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:02,960
think back on that

00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:06,080
yes so we have a nice

00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,600
agenda for you today so um i'm going to

be talking about the new blog of

00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:12,799
unity and so before we start we're going

00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,760
to give you a little overview of the

00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:15,200
project

00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:18,560
and then we're going straight into live

00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:20,720
demo yes live demo real life demo

00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,920
and um after we've done some demoing

00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,799
we're going to give some

00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,720
technical overviews of um you know what

00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:28,159
what we built and what we use for this

00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,159
and then we're going to highlight

00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,439
some of the backend and front-end

00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:34,479
features of the project

00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:35,680
and to wrap things up we or lars is

00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:37,840
going to provide some

00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,439
strategic insights like why unity made

00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,400
the technology choices and general

00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:43,040
choices they did

00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,600
and if we have time we're trying to like

00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,040
be

00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,640
good with our presentation then we can

00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,759
take some questions

00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:52,880
questions in the end so let's

00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:55,280
go right in so maybe last please give us

00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,320
some background of what we where we came

00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,119
from

00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:01,439
and where we going to go yeah more

00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:03,479
accurately where are we right now

00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:05,840
so we are right now with the blocks

00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:08,640
unity3d.com website which is a

00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:10,640
big wordpress website it have roughly 4

00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,400
000 blog posts majority of them is in

00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:15,920
english but there is also multiple other

00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:19,360
languages in play for them

00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:22,720
it has a traffic rate of around 2000

00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:26,000
unique visitors a month with a

00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:28,080
roughly 4 000 page views per month

00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,440
those page views drives around 8

00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:33,519
terabytes of data

00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:35,440
per month and an interesting

00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:37,200
bonus fact here as well was that the

00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,680
security systems that we have in front

00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,200
of

00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,040
in front of this not just for the block

00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:45,440
but for all our web properties

00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:48,840
caught uh over 60 million ddos attacks

00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:52,160
since february what's the february huh

00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:53,280
yes awesome oh i mean shoot yes so i

00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,760
think you meant 200

00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,040
000 visitors per month and 400 000 page

00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,480
views right

00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,239
you're completely correct and thank you

00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,680
for correcting it

00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:03,519
all right so this is where we come from

00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,200
so this was supposed to be migrated so

00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:06,879
big wordpress migration into a

00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:10,159
multilingual system

00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:12,879
of a high traffic website and

00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:13,680
yeah so we then work together unity and

00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:16,640
us to

00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,280
you know come up with a solid idea like

00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,800
what this

00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,480
what the target system should look like

00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,599
and so we decided to create like a

00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,239
decoupled

00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:26,480
triple eight back end expose the data

00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:28,080
with graphql we'll go into more details

00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,080
about this later

00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,280
and to migrate the content into

00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,519
something that is

00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,040
highly structured on the drupal side and

00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:38,000
for structuring the data

00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,599
we chose to use paragraphs and for the

00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,959
presentation layer and the front end the

00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:43,360
technology choice was

00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:45,040
next yes a react-based front-end

00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:49,360
framework and tailwind

00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:52,640
css are missing anything lars

00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,760
i think that wraps up the quick overview

00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:58,400
of it at least

00:03:53,760 --> 00:04:01,680
okay nice so live demo let's go in

00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:05,840
let's find everything goes well

00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:09,040
yes so here it is the brand new blog of

00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:11,200
unity.com so it's not live yet so the

00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,000
launch date is uh going to be in the end

00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,000
of this month

00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,680
so everybody who's attending here is

00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,479
getting a

00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,919
um a preview of what's going to come out

00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:21,359
you know you're the only ones except

00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:23,680
like us that are working on it

00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:24,960
so um yes really exclusive what we're

00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,840
showing to you

00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,960
so you see here you're looking at a next

00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:32,160
jazz application

00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:34,720
so we have a nice blog with a navigation

00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,840
search you know a featured section for

00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,479
blog posts

00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:41,440
below you have the latest blog posts

00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:44,880
then you can browse blog posts by topics

00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:46,560
you can browse blog posts by categories

00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:50,000
and if you go into blog post like for

00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:52,400
example this one here

00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,240
then you have like a nice detail page

00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,960
you have an author you have like

00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,360
a classification you have a hero image

00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,759
you have

00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,360
topics covered you have then all kinds

00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,880
of we refer to

00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,320
these content elements so this here is

00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,000
what you see is on the back hand side is

00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:08,160
a paragraph we will see this in a minute

00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,479
we refer to these as as content decks

00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,840
here you have some videos on this

00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:15,440
particular blog post

00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:18,000
and some more and yeah

00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:19,199
so you can for example you could go and

00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,880
here you could look at

00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:23,440
so the author in this case is kamina

00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:25,199
drummer so

00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:28,320
so she has like written a number of blog

00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:31,840
posts like also for example one here on

00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:34,000
computer computer vision and

00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,520
so this one we prepared prior to this

00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,400
presentation so we can play around with

00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,080
it so

00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,160
like here you see like a nice overview

00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:42,000
of all the stuff that you can like place

00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:45,039
in the blog so you have

00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,800
quotes you have text you have images

00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:48,560
you have the scrubber you can like move

00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,479
here between james holden and camina

00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:53,199
drama for example

00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:54,800
you can add videos you can put context

00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:56,479
next to

00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,319
paragraphs to content decks you can put

00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:01,680
context to your link to

00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:04,800
other related websites

00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:06,720
you can place hosted videos remote

00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,919
videos you can link to the forums forms

00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,199
a very big thing for

00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:12,160
um for unity as well of course i mean

00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:16,560
it's for coders

00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:18,960
you can have code snippets and yeah

00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,880
so can you have related blog posts you

00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:23,840
can browse the blog by

00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,880
by topics as well so speaking drupal

00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,880
topic is a

00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:30,000
taxonomy and that's a tag so with

00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:33,919
adapted performance there's two

00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,520
there's two blog posts tagged with it

00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:38,400
and

00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,360
yeah so what you see here we have here a

00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,680
navigation

00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,039
so this is a standard trooper menu with

00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,360
menu links

00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:46,840
exposed with graphql we have a search

00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:51,199
here so search if i search for

00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:52,960
unity so we integrated uh

00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:55,360
sajari search here so sargara is the

00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:58,000
search backend that unity is using so

00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,960
you can see here that it's not going to

00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,960
the um

00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,000
to the url of the develop system which

00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,160
is here hosted on

00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
on this development environment on on

00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,319
platform as age

00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,840
and so this is connected to the wrong

00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:11,440
index at the moment but that is

00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,680
will change of course when it goes live

00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:16,240
and the blog is then indexed

00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,280
and so this is external what you also

00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,919
see here on top

00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,800
is so this is being pulled in so this is

00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:22,880
not part of

00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,479
the website that's like an external

00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,639
component that

00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:28,840
you know shows the main menu of

00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:32,000
unity.com website

00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:35,520
um if we go

00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,440
here and we scroll more down you see the

00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,160
same on the footer so like here we have

00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,440
a footer

00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,919
on the on the bottom where you can

00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:44,960
switch the languages like here all the

00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:47,280
languages that are built into uh

00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,720
into the new blog and below you have a

00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,919
footer that's again being pulled in

00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:53,280
external it comes from

00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:56,800
from unity.com so let us

00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:59,360
start to play with some content so now

00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,800
this here you see the back end like it's

00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:04,000
a different uh

00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:06,240
uh uh platform as h instance

00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,840
and uh so the blog post we saw here like

00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,039
the computer vision blog post let's use

00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:12,879
this one here

00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:16,560
and change it so we saw that um

00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:18,639
this one was so the blog post written by

00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,599
was written by kamina drama let's change

00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:23,120
this to

00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:24,879
james holden right and save it

00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,400
and let's take a look what this comes

00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,160
out with

00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,919
and an important fact here is to look

00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:32,560
that the author

00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:33,519
that actually is posted in the byline is

00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:35,519
different from

00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:37,200
the author that does the change in our

00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:38,000
system we have a separation of this

00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,240
because

00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,599
usually an editorial team post on behalf

00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:45,120
of other people

00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:47,279
so there's a disconnect there yeah okay

00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,560
um so let's check out this change we

00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:50,480
just did so

00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,000
i can like access here you see now this

00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,720
blog post is

00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,160
published by james james holden so let's

00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,399
make some more changes you see here the

00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:00,480
hero image is a little bit

00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:02,399
cropped cropped let's change here the

00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,360
aspect ratio of this one here let's go

00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:06,720
to

00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:08,720
edit it again and

00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,320
and let's go here with my scrubber deck

00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,320
so here's the scrubber deck

00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,519
so we could change we could say like we

00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,399
don't want

00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:17,839
it's like changed like uh james holden

00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:20,000
for

00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:21,120
something else so i think we have here

00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,920
norman nagatang

00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,240
let's use her instead and let's also

00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,399
like

00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,240
change like the authors here like we

00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:31,360
actually want this to be

00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:34,399
drama count mina drama

00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:36,320
and we also want naomi to be like

00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:37,760
one of the co-authors and let's make

00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:41,120
that change and

00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:43,760
see where that takes us so now

00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:45,360
you can see the blog has has two authors

00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,839
that are listed oh i forgot to like

00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:50,480
change aspect ratio of this one here

00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:51,120
but i changed here the scrubber below

00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,120
and

00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,640
the scrubber deck so let's quickly make

00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,399
this other change because i actually

00:09:54,640 --> 00:10:00,959
wanted to have that

00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:03,360
um so this was here in the hero section

00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:05,200
where you see the images cropped so i

00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,800
want to actually show this original both

00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,560
for the desktop format and the mobile

00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,760
format so we deliver two types of images

00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:13,040
here to

00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:14,560
make the performance um or like the

00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,079
visual experience for the user as good

00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:19,440
as possible

00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:20,320
and now you also see here like on in the

00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:24,320
header the

00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:27,360
uncropped uncropped image

00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:31,120
um yes

00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:34,160
so um i think for the first

00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,720
demo part this is good last do you feel

00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,240
that

00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,000
we should mention something more or

00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,440
should we just go to technical overview

00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,760
immediately

00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,480
i think we can revisit some of the parts

00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,240
once

00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,079
we get further into the conversation

00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:48,640
here i think this gives a good

00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:50,000
first view of it yes maybe one thing

00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,839
that i would like to show that just

00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,079
comes into my mind here

00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:55,440
um let's go to let's look at it like

00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:57,839
this so like on the drupal side is the

00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:00,959
drupal side here so like we have like a

00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:02,720
structured front end like this um so

00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:04,079
what's maybe interesting to see

00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,680
to give you an overview because we're

00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:07,519
going to talk about the migration in a

00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,120
bit so we've seen all the different

00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:11,360
decks that you could add here

00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:13,360
so here's an overview so like the

00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:15,200
content is structured into a text decks

00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:17,360
headline decks link blocks embedded

00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:20,800
posts image remote video video

00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:22,880
audio scrubber and code snippets and

00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,720
yeah so this is the structured data that

00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:28,399
that you were seeing

00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:31,600
okay let's move back to our presentation

00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:32,560
so uh here's a technical uh overview

00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,480
that

00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,680
we've compiled so on the technology side

00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,600
what you just saw was a

00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:39,600
drupal symphony back end like data

00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,920
exposed with graphql

00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,600
and on the front and next yes react and

00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:45,360
styling was done with

00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,959
tailwind css and the components were

00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:50,160
actually prepared with

00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:52,480
as standalone components with storybook

00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:54,160
before we'll show this in in a minute on

00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:56,639
the infrastructure side the code

00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,600
i think all code for web properties

00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:01,600
hosted on

00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:03,600
github.com for you last right yes

00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,680
for our site we have multiple github

00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:08,800
instances so yes all of us are

00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:09,279
are on github.com yeah and for hosting

00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,200
here

00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:12,880
platform as h is used both for the front

00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,120
end and the back end so on the back end

00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,959
of

00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,320
obviously a drupal stack and in the

00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:19,279
front end the node

00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:21,519
uh node server to that can run next.js

00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:24,240
delivered delivery is done by akamai

00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:25,680
and yeah nice thing the infrastructure

00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,040
too that's worth mentioning is that

00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,800
unity has like a

00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:30,800
a login system so anyone who just

00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,800
engages with unity like in the forums on

00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:35,120
the blog and commenting system

00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,639
whenever is gets a so-called unity id so

00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,440
that's integrated here as well so it's

00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:39,360
used for

00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,480
log into the blog and to all other

00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:43,360
systems

00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:45,279
and the services we saw um i forgot to

00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,440
show this like on the bottom

00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:49,120
it was maybe let's go quickly back to

00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:51,120
this one here

00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,240
so you see a commenting system here on

00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,560
the bottom

00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:56,320
so this one here so we chose to use an

00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:58,000
external service for this as well so

00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:01,200
this is called vfora

00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,320
and um yeah we chose this over um over

00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,240
drupal's inbuilt

00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:07,040
commenting system and and consent

00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:11,279
management this is one trust

00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:13,120
um so i want to show you

00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:14,800
one thing before we then go into the

00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:17,040
highlights and this is

00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,639
actually how we use storybook in this

00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:21,839
project so i have here a

00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:23,680
local installation of storybook so

00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:25,279
you see here in the navigation of

00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:27,680
storybook like the components that were

00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:30,959
used for the blog so here's this is the

00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:33,040
component for displaying um like author

00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:36,160
header so this was the same like

00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:37,040
when we just look here like for camina

00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,279
drummer

00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:40,880
like what her header looks like so this

00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:42,000
is exactly this component that you see

00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:44,720
here

00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,480
and um yeah then we have more for

00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,160
example here like this would be the

00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,160
browse by topic

00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:52,480
thing and like here would be the the

00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:54,160
carousel the nice thing about uh

00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,240
storybook it just lost gives you a nice

00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:57,839
presentation of components so these are

00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,199
rec components and you can for example

00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:00,800
also review them

00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:02,399
let's say if you wanted to like check

00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:05,680
what this looks like you know

00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:08,160
in in a different resolution

00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:09,519
so what you also see here so these are

00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,519
the components for the blog

00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:12,880
so how unity does it this is the

00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:14,959
storybook of all their

00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:16,720
components or like like at least more

00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:17,920
components than i used for the blog so

00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,600
you see like some

00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:21,440
general design system components and you

00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,240
also see the global navigation here so

00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,560
the

00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:26,000
header we saw here on top you know this

00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:28,320
one here

00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,079
this is actually this is this component

00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,639
and the footer we also saw earlier

00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:33,760
like on the bottom this is this element

00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:37,279
down here

00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:37,279
together with our seals now combined

00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:43,920
all right so

00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:46,079
let's talk about some of the highlights

00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:50,079
um that we have here in the system

00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:51,519
so the thing that was a nice

00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:53,440
nice thing to do or was actually a

00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:54,880
challenge is is to migrate from

00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,160
from wordpress so if you have used

00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,600
wordpress or even migrated from

00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,000
wordpress before you know the data is

00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,399
that much

00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,440
less structured than than a drupal so

00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:04,880
much is sitting in

00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,519
in just text fields and we migrated this

00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,519
into

00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:09,279
infrastructure data into paragraphs so

00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:10,399
the way we had to do this was actually

00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:12,720
parse um

00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:14,800
parse the content and then recognize in

00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,560
text areas if now video was coming so

00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,160
that was then migrated into a video deck

00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,839
if there was a remote video would be a

00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:21,519
remote video deck if it was text it was

00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:23,839
text and so on

00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:26,399
image and we needed to find like ways to

00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:27,839
extract preview images and extract like

00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:30,160
hero images and

00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:31,680
and all this stuff so that that took

00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:33,759
some time

00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:35,360
and um but it's definitely doable so

00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:36,000
like if you're wondering if this can be

00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:39,519
done yes

00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,839
it can be done um yeah

00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:43,279
what was a bit challenging was also to

00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:46,560
you know migrate the content

00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:48,320
into a multilingual system because the

00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:50,639
multilingual capabilities of drupal as

00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:53,040
you probably know are really powerful

00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:55,440
and um to make this work that actually

00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:58,720
also that took some time

00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,600
um so we used for exposing the data we

00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,639
used the

00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:04,560
graphql module version 4

00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:06,240
of the drupal module version 4. so the

00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,959
difference between version 3 and 4 is

00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,040
that like

00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:10,959
in version three you get automatic

00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:12,079
graphql endpoints with automatic schema

00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:13,920
generation

00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:15,600
and what this does it presents the data

00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:17,279
as it's uh

00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,959
as it exists internally in drupal so it

00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:20,639
has like all this

00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:22,560
stuff that you know from render arrays

00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:23,360
and like from fields from pre-processing

00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,399
and stuff

00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,320
and that's of course not a good

00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:27,759
experience for um for front-end

00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:30,240
developers but if you use

00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:32,160
version four you can you actually you

00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,959
have to write the schemas yourself

00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:36,399
and but that allows you to um you know

00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:36,800
create really beautiful endpoints that

00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,240
uh

00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,639
for frontline developers really nice to

00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:42,079
work with i want to show this here

00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:45,040
briefly

00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:46,000
so i have here a is an endpoint loaded

00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:48,160
so this is like a

00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,639
chrome extension i'm using for this and

00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:52,959
here you saw i just like did the live

00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:53,759
request to um to the api of the backend

00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:56,959
system

00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:58,560
and you see here that um i get i get

00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:00,079
really nice responses if i add something

00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,440
here let's say like the date

00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:04,720
you know so this is the published date

00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:08,079
this is the field it's a field that um

00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:10,000
that exists in drupal you know and

00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:11,439
and that just just translates or comes

00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,079
back like into like a very

00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:14,799
structured nice field for example if you

00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:17,360
looked into

00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:18,000
you know like what is the image field

00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:19,679
and the schema

00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,520
look like it just contains like the url

00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:23,600
the width the height

00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,640
the alt text and the title and that's

00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,000
exactly what you want to see in the

00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,400
front that you don't want to see any of

00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,440
the

00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:33,600
drupal magic generic things in there so

00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:37,200
this is how this was done um

00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:38,720
really i think like like so you have to

00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,760
little bit get into it like once you

00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:42,720
have figured out how to

00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:44,640
write schema for a graphical module or

00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,799
version four then it's really simple

00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,799
like before it's not plug play but it's

00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:51,200
it's worth it so that was good

00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:52,080
um you saw that we exposed lots of

00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:55,280
images uh

00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:56,720
in the in the front end so we in in

00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,400
if you build a decoupled page with

00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,160
something like nextges you let the front

00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,840
end handle image resizing

00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:03,360
so the only thing we did on the back end

00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,799
was cropping the image so

00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,480
for this we had to write a new plugin

00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:08,799
which we also contributed

00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:10,400
which just cuts an image down like to

00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:11,120
the desired aspect ratio but doesn't

00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,559
resize it

00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:14,880
you know so that was not possible with

00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:16,880
the image style so we had the chance for

00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:19,760
contribution here as well

00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:21,200
and yeah so we have nine languages we're

00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:22,320
using translation management and

00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,400
connected this with

00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:26,240
xtm which is a large provider that is

00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:28,880
that unity is using for

00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,679
everything so um that was also nice to

00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,720
do

00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:35,360
um we built an editorial workflow

00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:37,440
because the editorial team is how many

00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:39,600
are on your team

00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:41,200
so from the editorial team there is

00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:44,240
eight dedicated

00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:45,280
people that covers everything that is

00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,280
social

00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:49,360
uh they of course interact with

00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,960
everybody across unity in order to bring

00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:53,280
the content to the platforms

00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:55,520
but there's eight dedicated people that

00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:57,360
work on it actively

00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,720
so so we created workflow for them using

00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,720
the inbuilt functionality from drupal

00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:03,200
here as well this was nice

00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:05,600
and yeah so functionality i'm going to

00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:08,000
show in a second is we provide

00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:10,160
options to access unpublished nodes and

00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
which came out really nicely and yeah

00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:14,240
highlights also the way like we built

00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,440
the editorial experience so we're proud

00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,919
of this too

00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:19,840
so let's go back to demo this a little

00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:23,919
bit more

00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:25,600
so um yeah so in case you haven't seen

00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:28,720
this like you're looking here at

00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:30,559
um at an admin theme called gin

00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,640
um it's really beautiful so it gives you

00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:35,840
like access to um

00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:37,520
all kinds of things here and um and

00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:39,039
it's a really nice experience nice to

00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:41,280
build it we built a lot of

00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:43,039
things like this and i wanted to see

00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,799
here actually i want to go to

00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:46,559
content because you want to look at

00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:48,080
unpublished nodes

00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:50,240
so we have here here's our content

00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:53,840
overview you see here also the

00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:56,080
tab for for moderated content

00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:58,400
and you see here we have here uh preview

00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:00,160
ul tokens so here's a list of tokens

00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:02,080
that are generated and here for example

00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:04,640
here's a blog post this one

00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:06,720
and this is not published so you see

00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:09,440
it's it's in spanish

00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:11,280
and um yeah so it's it's it's not

00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:13,919
published it's like in draft mode

00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,880
and um as uh la said earlier so lots of

00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:16,400
the editors

00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,080
they're actually not from the unity team

00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,520
so they're external so they need to

00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,799
when they send them content that's

00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,919
supposed to be published before it's

00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:24,640
published

00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:26,159
needs to be reviewed and um and this can

00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:28,159
be done by just you know

00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:30,320
generating a temporary access token

00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:32,320
which is this one here so

00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:33,760
same thing you see here here you see all

00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,120
the

00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:36,880
and one of the valuable things about

00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:39,679
this here is that it allows

00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:41,600
our editorial team to create a piece of

00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:43,280
content have it approved by whoever

00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:46,400
needs to approve it that can be

00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:49,360
microsoft xbox sonia whoever it is that

00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:51,520
are approving something in their domain

00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:53,280
before we actually publish it

00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,559
this is basically that functionality

00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,000
that we are providing through the

00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:58,000
unpublished uh

00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,919
nodes so let's take a look so i'm going

00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,240
to copy this access token so i'm going

00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:02,559
to

00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:04,000
just paste it into the front end so i

00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:05,919
have to do like a little work around

00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,799
because it's already it has hard coded

00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:09,039
the

00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:10,880
the live url when the blog is there but

00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:11,440
now you see like i'm just like accessing

00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,520
a

00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:16,240
preview of a website you know so like

00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:18,240
even with you know like a preview url

00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:21,200
and this is exactly the page that is

00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:24,320
created here which is not yet published

00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:25,600
so this functionality came out quite

00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:29,440
nicely and this

00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:32,000
has good value for um for unity

00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:33,200
all right let's move to um highlights of

00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,000
the front end

00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,640
um so we already saw that um you know we

00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,320
had the

00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,480
unpublished pages so like the way this

00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:42,640
plays out is just really nice

00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:44,080
what was also nice like how we didn't

00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,640
know in the beginning how we were going

00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,000
to

00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,440
provide the experience that you go from

00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
the back and to the front end you have

00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,440
seen that i

00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,520
just click on link and that takes me

00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:53,760
directly to the front end

00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:56,720
and that was actually a nice way of

00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:58,960
dislike connecting the two we felt

00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,480
what was interesting was to work with

00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:02,559
image optimization in the

00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:04,240
in the front end because if you do a lot

00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:06,320
of drupal you you know drupal has all

00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:08,320
these awesome functionalities with

00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:09,440
responsive images and image styles and

00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,640
whatnot and

00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:12,159
you don't have to do any of this that's

00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,360
handled by the front end so this was

00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:14,960
nice

00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:16,480
at the moment it's unclear if image

00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,600
reciting is going to be handled by

00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:21,679
akamai

00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:23,919
or or next yes both as possible

00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:26,320
the component development storybook this

00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:28,640
was a lot of fun and the integration of

00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:29,840
header footer and search and commenting

00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:33,039
system that also worked

00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:34,960
quite nicely and um yeah what is also

00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:36,480
definitely a highlight is how we expose

00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:39,360
metadata and

00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,840
json ld data via graphql to the front

00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,559
end i

00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:43,840
i want to show this quickly here too so

00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:46,880
if you're on like a

00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:49,039
website like this and uh you inspect it

00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:51,039
and let's give it a little more space

00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:54,159
here and i search for

00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:57,120
jason ld jason

00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:57,840
ld there it is so then you see here like

00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,880
here's like

00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:02,720
automatically generated a json ld markup

00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:04,320
that is coming from the backend so we

00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,400
use all the goodness of

00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:08,640
drupal here to just generate this based

00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:10,880
on the information of the blog post

00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:13,280
and you also see here all the meta tags

00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:15,200
um that also being auto generated so

00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:17,039
that actually also came out really nice

00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,520
for the um for the different pages that

00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:19,440
we

00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:20,960
you know were able to use everything

00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,240
that drupal has to offer here simply

00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:25,039
expose it on

00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,600
on endpoint and um and let the front end

00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:29,039
use it

00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:31,600
as is so this was a good experience um

00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:33,039
yeah last but not least of course with a

00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,799
blog of that size there's advanced

00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:36,720
analytics going on so everything's being

00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:40,159
measured here and

00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:44,240
this is also fun to integrate

00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:47,039
yeah so the live part of this was there

00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:48,240
now we're going coming to the final part

00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:50,960
of

00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:52,400
this presentation and some strategic

00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,080
insights so um

00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,440
yeah alas why don't you tell us a bit

00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:57,840
like like how

00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:59,679
actually unity works with technology in

00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:03,520
its community

00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:05,919
i will i will so what one of the

00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:07,679
the fundamental things we we believe at

00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:09,039
here at unity is that

00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:11,279
the world is a better place with more

00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:14,640
creators in it uh that comes into

00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:16,240
uh its own life when you think about the

00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:18,480
community that we are first during the

00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:21,760
community that we want to

00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:23,840
help achieve their goals and

00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,799
it's all about being able to discover

00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:27,520
learn and grow

00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:28,320
as a person in that space and it's all

00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,919
about

00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:33,840
getting the right information at the

00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:33,840
right time

00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:38,000
our block our block here is the

00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,840
consumption based point of

00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,039
where to actually get that information

00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:44,559
it is the place where

00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:46,640
our visitors get

00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:47,760
the most up-to-date information about

00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:50,640
all launches all

00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:52,080
products all elements of new stuff going

00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:56,559
on in the

00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:58,080
in the unity space um nice

00:24:56,559 --> 00:25:00,159
yeah this is also really nice for us to

00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:01,039
learn like that the blog is just really

00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:03,600
that's that's a

00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:05,279
cornerstone website for unity and um you

00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:07,200
often think maybe it's just a blog no

00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:09,440
this is like the most one of the most

00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:12,720
important uh web properties

00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:15,600
um so we also want to like take a

00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:16,400
look like from the um technical side

00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:20,080
like why

00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:23,200
why is unity doing it this way

00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:25,279
so we are not uh we're not dictating

00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,640
anything about that engineers how they

00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:29,760
go about implementing

00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:30,400
stuff we set a goal of something and

00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:33,360
then each

00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:34,799
each team picks the technology and the

00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:36,400
platform that they want in order to

00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:37,360
achieve it of course they pressure test

00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,200
it and

00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:40,720
attempt to figure out if it is the right

00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:43,200
choice to go with

00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:44,880
but we try to be broad and open to

00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,720
picking any technology that fits the

00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,360
goal of what we're doing drupal in this

00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,520
case

00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:51,360
allows us to be fast in iterations it

00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:54,400
allows us to easily extend it

00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:55,600
it gives us apa api api capabilities

00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:57,679
that we were looking for

00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,720
it gives us a bill structured approach

00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:02,880
to things

00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:06,159
and it's a great platform to build on

00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:06,159
yeah nice that's good to hear

00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:10,720
from the front-end perspective next

00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:12,720
year's is more of a gamble for us where

00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:16,080
we are trying out a new area

00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:17,919
of building a decoupled front end that

00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:20,960
allows us to pull in data

00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:22,480
from multiple sources while being

00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:24,799
performant allow for server-side

00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:25,600
rendering and cu optimization and still

00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:28,880
be a modern

00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:29,360
and solid platform and lastly to that

00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:32,799
point of

00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:35,279
about graphql graphql is not picked

00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:36,880
specifically it is something that

00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:39,279
there's a bigger strategic

00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:40,320
interest at for within the websphere

00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:44,080
here unity

00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:46,159
where we wanna extend the blog at some

00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:49,039
point to actually go into a federated

00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:50,480
graphql service that's being built so at

00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:52,799
some point in the future

00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,840
the blog will migrate into a different

00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:56,720
endpoint at

00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:58,640
the back end and then being being able

00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,600
to pull in data from multiple services

00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,880
here at unity

00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:03,520
so that's the reason for going with

00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:06,799
graphql and getting that experience in

00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:10,000
early as well okay

00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:12,559
nice so um

00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,080
yeah thank you that was that was awesome

00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:14,960
la so we even have time for some

00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:17,360
questions because

00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:19,120
according to time i think we have a

00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:21,360
couple of minutes left so i'm opening

00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:25,600
here the q a

00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:28,880
section and in reading what's there

00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:31,679
ah yeah so i see one question here

00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:33,200
there was about the commenting system i

00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:35,760
think this was already

00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:37,760
answered let's look back here so in the

00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:39,360
technical overview

00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:40,960
you saw like the commenting system it's

00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:44,799
called viaphora

00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:46,399
and um like like when we evaluate it

00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:49,279
together with the editorial team

00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:49,840
like like a dedicated commenting system

00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:52,080
just like

00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:53,679
has a lot more functionality than what

00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:56,720
drupal comes with out of the box

00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:57,919
and um it was just like a choice a make

00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:01,520
or by choice and

00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:04,720
and it was just a by choice so josh that

00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:07,520
there was nothing more to um

00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:08,799
to that so another question from josh is

00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:12,000
like popping up here

00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:13,200
so it was about the uh unpublished notes

00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,520
i think that was also

00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,480
answered because like we had there's a

00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:19,120
process for

00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:20,640
um you know like uh getting like

00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:22,000
feedback on content before it gets

00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,600
published from the stakeholders that

00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:27,520
actually own this content

00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:29,520
and for this we need a way to you know

00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:32,720
display the content while it was not

00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:34,399
published this was that

00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:36,159
last you can also look if you find some

00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:37,919
questions that you think um

00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:39,520
you would like to comment on the the

00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:40,480
most popular one is currently the

00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:43,440
graphql over

00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:44,080
json api i think we already touched on

00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,320
it uh

00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:47,840
it's no that there's nothing wrong with

00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:49,919
either platform

00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:51,679
but for the wider version at unity it

00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:53,120
makes more sense for us to go into

00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:57,279
graphql than it does

00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:57,279
playing around with the json api

00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:02,320
capabilities i think right yeah

00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:05,919
um yes so somebody was asking about the

00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:09,039
back-end

00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:12,080
uh search uh engine so this was

00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:13,840
this is sajari that was used there and

00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:14,640
it's also an external service the server

00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:17,679
scrapes

00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:19,919
the website you know for for content and

00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:21,279
then provides search that can just be

00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:22,640
you know where you have a reg component

00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:24,399
or i think in this case a view jazz

00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:26,720
component that we're using

00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:28,480
for displaying the search and um yeah so

00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:31,520
that was this

00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:31,840
so what more do you have and jack kieran

00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:35,039
is

00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:36,799
asking about other decks

00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:38,559
custom functionality for paragraph built

00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:39,279
by unity team or is the functional

00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:41,760
provided

00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:43,840
by a country module seems like a nice

00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:46,880
way to select paragraphs

00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:47,919
it is built on standard functionality

00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:50,480
that paragraphs

00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:51,679
comes with there's nothing special going

00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:54,960
on there

00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:56,640
it's just styled in a nice way yes

00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,600
so as we had on the highlight page a

00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,440
little bit earlier there was one

00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,240
contribution that we made that was just

00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:02,559
for you know

00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:04,559
cropping images that was really the only

00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:06,640
you know custom content we had to

00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:08,799
had to create like everything you see

00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:10,480
like on the on the backhand side of

00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:11,520
drupal i mean it's wired together in a

00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,919
good way

00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:16,080
and but like this aspect about dex and

00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:18,240
how the data is assembled that is just

00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:19,279
engineering plus like capabilities what

00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:23,039
drupal has

00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:25,279
combined nicely and then styled yeah

00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:26,480
there's a quick question i think do we

00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:30,480
have time for that

00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:32,399
maybe on the rope uh

00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:34,320
from william lewis are you planning on

00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:37,279
using next.js image component

00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:38,640
we are already using it we are just

00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:41,840
using it with two different

00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:42,559
types of uh providers for it either

00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:45,440
akamai

00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:47,039
or the default one we cannot use the

00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:48,159
default one in production at the moment

00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:51,360
because

00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:53,600
akamai because because nextgs is very uh

00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:54,399
persistent in how it wants its casting

00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:58,240
to be

00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:58,240
so we have to override that in some way

00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:02,000
i can elaborate more on it later on if

00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:04,559
you want to know more about it

00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,240
yes so maybe a question to air in our

00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:07,360
session moderator are we going to get

00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:18,799
kicked out here in

00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:22,320
in a second or um

00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:24,559
so to me she sounded like um

00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:25,600
that was a very robotic voice yes i

00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:28,799
didn't hear what she said

00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:31,760
maybe she said some more minutes yeah

00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:32,720
and um so it was about there was one

00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:35,760
question about

00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:38,080
advanced analytics so um

00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:39,519
like what what was a highlight for us

00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:41,279
there i mean like

00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:43,600
unity has like very strong analytics

00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:44,000
team and they just told us exactly per

00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,760
deck

00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,600
per page for content type what they

00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:48,640
wanted us to push to the data layer and

00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:51,679
we did

00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:53,440
and this was a huge document and um

00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:55,120
this was easy to set up because like

00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:56,320
when next year is renders you know like

00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,440
there's some component and each

00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:59,679
component you know

00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:01,519
triggered some data layer pushes and

00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:03,039
exactly the way that unity want to have

00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:03,679
it and that just that just ran through

00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:04,880
so

00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:06,559
like often when you start doing

00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:07,760
analytics in the end of the projects

00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:10,080
it's a little bit of a ping pong back

00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:12,640
and forth so this was not the case here

00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:14,240
and um so that actually worked nicely

00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,799
they really make it easy for us to

00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,399
implement

00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:17,919
analytics that goes for all the

00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:20,080
platforms where we

00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:21,600
work together with our analytics team no

00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:23,679
matter what platform it is they always

00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:25,600
come very detailed and very oriented

00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:27,679
towards business goals at the end this

00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:30,000
is what we want to track so that we can

00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:32,559
get this information out of it it's

00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,240
always great to work with them

00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:36,480
there's also a question from peter

00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:37,600
farrell why was next year's chosen over

00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:40,080
gatsby and

00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:41,760
other choices interestingly enough we

00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:43,919
did actually test out gatsby as a

00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:46,320
potential for this platform

00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:47,440
uh but by going through iterations of

00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,960
four thousand

00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:50,880
different blog posts in nine different

00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:52,960
languages we came to

00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:55,039
the conclusion that gatsby would take 20

00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:56,399
to 30 minutes to actually just compile

00:32:55,039 --> 00:33:00,480
in order to deploy

00:32:56,399 --> 00:33:02,320
which makes it something we couldn't use

00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:04,080
so what you're saying is like if you

00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:06,080
wanted to use gatsby as a static site

00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,399
generator of just like generating like

00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:10,399
the

00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:12,799
the whole thing okay yeah exactly it's

00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:14,080
it unfortunately we have that big of a

00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:15,600
bunch of data in it

00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:17,519
and a lot of data that's being pulled in

00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:18,720
from different sources having to compile

00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:22,159
it in that bigger chunk

00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:24,640
is just not doable when we want to move

00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:26,559
fast as well

00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:28,240
so there are a little bit more questions

00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:31,840
coming in for analytics so it's

00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:34,960
google analytics and google tag manager

00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:36,240
that's being used from what i've seen at

00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:37,279
least we pushed to data layers so i

00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:40,799
assume it's

00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:42,159
it's it's that and um wow i know it's

00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:44,480
that but i haven't seen it in more

00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:47,840
detail by myself

00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:50,960
um yeah what more

00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:52,480
um questions do we have here somebody

00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:54,799
was asking ah maurizio

00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:56,960
nice to uh nice to see you so you

00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:58,559
marissa was asking about like

00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:00,000
a source plugins to migrate from

00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:01,600
wordpress yes

00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,760
we did have to write so code there

00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:06,559
because that is just non-standard

00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:08,399
so um so that was definitely needs to be

00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:10,480
done so we did evaluate what's what

00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:12,000
drupal has in the contract space for um

00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:13,520
wordpress migration but

00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:16,000
this was not enough for us because we

00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:18,240
need to like split content and fields

00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,399
you know with regular expressions or

00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:23,440
pattern recognitions of like

00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:24,399
um or like the whatever recognition here

00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:26,159
of the um

00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:27,679
of the markup to like split this into

00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:29,679
the corresponding decks

00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:30,800
so this was that was this was very

00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:32,879
custom but

00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:35,839
solely using what what triple what

00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:35,839
triple has on the base

00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:40,240
one of the points that also made it a

00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:42,879
bit bit messy to actually do the

00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:44,560
migration is that the way that

00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:46,399
translations currently are handled in

00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:49,520
wordpress is that all translations get

00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:50,320
mushed into one field so you have all

00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:53,520
languages

00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:54,639
basically a structured data blob inside

00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:57,680
of one field in

00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:59,520
wordpress which is yeah challenging

00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:01,119
sometimes

00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:03,119
maybe we could take one last question

00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:05,920
somebody uh here gareth

00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:06,720
asked like why why headless and um and

00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:08,640
not just

00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:10,800
regular drupal i think last you

00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:13,520
mentioned that before like you wanted to

00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:14,880
go headless because um you know like

00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:17,520
this is where you want to go

00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:19,280
like with or where unity wants to go and

00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:21,359
like we were like the first to like try

00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:25,040
this out for real on

00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:27,359
on on a big web property and um yeah

00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:28,320
i think there was no real do this or

00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:30,240
that it's just like you

00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:31,440
you want to do it and here we try it and

00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:33,920
then we see like

00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:34,640
which way it goes it's also the

00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:38,079
strategic

00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:39,359
uh approach of uh of course create once

00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:41,839
published everywhere

00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:43,599
where we we get the ability to actually

00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:44,480
reuse our content across different

00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:46,880
platforms

00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:48,560
that could be in the unity hub or inside

00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:50,800
the unity editor

00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:52,320
where we could push notification very

00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:56,320
easily to the different

00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:58,079
places and drive traffic around there

00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:59,920
this headless approach where we have an

00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:01,760
api that grants us

00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:04,560
the decoupling from the front end allows

00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:06,079
us more seamlessly to actually integrate

00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:08,800
multiple services

00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:12,400
both in to one place but also pushing

00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:15,839
the data out to multiple places

00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:16,240
so i have a suggestion so i think we can

00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:19,040
maybe

00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:21,040
close a session now and um so it was a

00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:22,079
lot of fun so maybe last you'll be to go

00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,520
into

00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:25,119
one of the hallway tracks or something

00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:26,480
let's go to the hallway track number one

00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:28,079
and then meet there and then whoever

00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,560
wants to join us and ask more questions

00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:31,520
or

00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:32,079
chat directly we can do it there and um

00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,359
i think

00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:36,640
that's what we could do or what do you

00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:38,720
think i'm up for it

00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:40,880
all right so then everybody thank you

00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:43,920
for listening to us and um

00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:45,599
yeah it was fun uh we're we're gonna

00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:46,400
close now and then see you if you want

00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:48,000
to in the hall

00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:49,440
in the first hallway session like if you

00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,880
click on the left two

00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:53,040
sessions and then you're fine and before

00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:54,480
we come please to close off a big huge

00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,960
thanks for 1x internet for actually

00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:57,440
working

00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:59,680
on this project with us it has been lots

00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:01,920
of fun and a big thanks to

00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:03,920
