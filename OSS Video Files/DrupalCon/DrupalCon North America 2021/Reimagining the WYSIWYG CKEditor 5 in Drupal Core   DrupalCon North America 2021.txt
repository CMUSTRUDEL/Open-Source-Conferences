snow last night so that's um

00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:07,680
i wish i was in drupal town in boston

00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:07,680
instead

00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,480
so this session is called reimagine the

00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:14,080
wysiwyg so welcome

00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,839
if you're able to watch the drupal 10

00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:18,160
readiness keynote this morning

00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:19,840
you may have some context already but in

00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,840
this talk i'll go into more detail about

00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,920
why we're working on c category 5 and

00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:30,400
what it could mean for drupal and how

00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:33,519
you can get involved

00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,519
so my name is peter weber

00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,480
oh yeah i'm so sorry one second uh next

00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,680
reminder

00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,680
let me just turn the captions on real

00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,840
quick

00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:52,000
so my name is peter weber and i've been

00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:55,440
a drupal developer for around

00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,120
12 years one second

00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,559
so i'm getting used to the present

00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,800
getting used to hop in

00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:01,600
um so i've let me start over my name is

00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,960
peter weber

00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,360
i've been a drupal developer for around

00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,040
12 years mostly working at agencies or

00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,640
sometimes freelance

00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,080
i've been at acquia for the past two

00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,400
years as a member of the drupal

00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:14,560
acceleration team where i've had the

00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,920
opportunity to work on drupal core

00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,320
specifically with some of the javascript

00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,840
modern nation modernization initiatives

00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,880
and then most recently working on

00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,880
upgrading the ck editor

00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,520
so i'm going to talk about seek editor 5

00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,400
and why we're trying to add it to drupal

00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,600
core

00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,479
but first i wanted to give a little

00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:35,840
background information on how ck editor

00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:37,200
got into drupal if you're not familiar

00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,079
with the history of seek editor and

00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,040
drupal

00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:43,840
it was released about with drupal 8.0

00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,600
which was close to a decade ago

00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,680
so adding useful tools in the core was a

00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,439
big deal at the time drupal 7 had added

00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:53,360
fields so you didn't need to install

00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:54,079
cck and then in drupal 8 we got even

00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,200
more

00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:58,560
in core such as views

00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,479
it's great this year at drupalcon we

00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,960
have an entire initiative day for

00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:05,200
easy out of the box but this has been a

00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,960
trend with drupal for years

00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:10,319
when drupal 8 released there were lots

00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:13,920
of options for wysiwyg drupal

00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:15,440
but not one uh sorry not one that was

00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,280
ready as soon as you install the site

00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,760
which would make it easy out of the box

00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,680
or

00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,440
straight out of the box so at the time

00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,800
adding c editor and core

00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,800
was an out of the box improvement

00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,879
so this talk is about reimagining the

00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,360
wysiwyg but would it why does it need to

00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:32,239
be

00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:34,000
reimagined i think it's worth explaining

00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:36,239
that although wysiwyg may be really

00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,080
useful for a content creator it has

00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,360
historically been at odds with adding

00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,120
structured content

00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:44,319
or making a site layout that worked the

00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:46,480
way a designer pictured it

00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:47,519
in karen mcgrane's keynote at drupalcon

00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,319
portland

00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:51,120
back in 2013 i think she railed against

00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:54,879
the wysiwyg

00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:56,959
for letting you edit blobs of content

00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:59,280
the presentation is mixed into the data

00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:01,920
and impossible to separate

00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,599
blobs are the enemy of structured chunks

00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:06,159
of content which is what we try to make

00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:06,159
in drupal

00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:12,480
in a confession i was in the crowd

00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,480
cheering when this slide came up

00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,040
so i just mentioned that i worked in

00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:20,000
agencies for the bulk of my career

00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:22,879
and the wysiwyg was always a challenge

00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,159
in some ways it offers a lot of promise

00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:26,159
but in other ways it adds a layer of

00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:28,159
frustration when a user can't place a

00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:30,560
style in just the right spot

00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:32,159
or get stuck you know in a bulleted list

00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,280
or you can't stop typing inside a

00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:35,680
heading

00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:38,159
the promise that you can style content

00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:41,040
exactly the way it appears on the screen

00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:42,319
but that rarely happens you're either

00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,920
too limited and you don't have the

00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:45,519
flexibility you'd have when actually

00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,360
editing html

00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:51,040
or you're just editing html and you have

00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,040
too much freedom and no guardrails

00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,959
so using a wysiwyg reminded me of

00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,640
dreamweaver and i know i'm dating myself

00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,840
a bit to even show this but

00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,840
i remember clicking around in the

00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,040
graphical mode and just getting lost and

00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,360
getting stuck and

00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,959
as soon as i knew enough html i never

00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:08,080
used that visual mode again

00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:08,480
because i could write better html than

00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,080
some

00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:13,519
gui some gui that was trying to

00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:15,760
interpret my mouse drags and clicks

00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,959
so i'm sure like many of you um i

00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,639
clicked the view source button

00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:21,919
in the wysiwyg and i jumped into html

00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:23,600
mode whenever i needed to fix a problem

00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:25,840
however that's not always an answer for

00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:28,080
a client i've worked both with clients

00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,840
who didn't want to touch html

00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,759
and with clients who knew too much and

00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,840
started writing their own styles

00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:37,280
and ended up with pages that didn't

00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,280
match the original designs at all

00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,320
seek editor 5 has an internal data model

00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,479
for parsing a document

00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,520
that's why not just any arbitrary html

00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:47,520
will work and

00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:49,759
why you can't just toggle over to view

00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,600
source and make your own edits

00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:53,120
you can read this github thread to see

00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,160
some of the frustration and anger from

00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,080
the community

00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,080
and also the incredible patience and

00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,639
thoughtfulness of the ck source team

00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:02,240
and their responses for many people in

00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:03,120
that thread the idea of not being able

00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,240
to click over and

00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:08,080
fix the html is a deal breaker

00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,160
how can you have a wysiwyg without a way

00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:13,199
to override it or make edits that you

00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,199
can't do in the ui

00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:18,479
at first i didn't get it either my past

00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,680
experience had me feeling like the

00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:21,039
wysiwyg

00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,039
or wysiwygs in general are not

00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:24,960
trustworthy and not reliable and you

00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:26,320
can't accomplish what you want to

00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,919
and some of my former colleagues have

00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,800
even recently declared the body field

00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:30,080
dead

00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,919
i wouldn't have disagreed with that six

00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,039
months ago

00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:34,960
this is largely because of what i

00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:36,800
mentioned that complex content in the

00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,479
body field

00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,840
that is unmanageable it's difficult to

00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:41,440
style consistently

00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,520
and it's risky to hand off to a client

00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,880
who either doesn't know enough html or

00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,160
knows too much and will make the site

00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,759
look drastically different than a

00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,240
designer intended in just a few months

00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,240
of edits

00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,160
so what could be better if we don't

00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:56,560
allow markup areas

00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,880
then how do we achieve flexible layouts

00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:01,440
how do we empower a content creator

00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:03,120
to both craft any page they need while

00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:06,560
still giving preset options that will

00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:08,880
preserve the site design

00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,319
in drupal we often reach for a solution

00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:12,560
like nested paragraphs

00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:14,319
to embed specific components exactly on

00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,160
the page where we want them

00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:18,319
this can be exactly what a developer

00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,639
needs creating component types

00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:23,759
having full control over the template

00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:26,639
although it can be a ton of extra work

00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,680
however it can be well it can feel a bit

00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:29,039
heavy-handed

00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,560
creating a paragraph type for a

00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:33,039
two-column layout means making a

00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:36,400
paragraph that just has two slots for

00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:36,400
actual content paragraphs

00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:42,240
even with a nicer ui it gets you farther

00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:44,479
away from the content

00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,000
and it becomes more and more abstract

00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:48,080
this can be tough both for a content

00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,080
creator as well as a developer

00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:52,160
and if you have a decoupled site what do

00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:55,039
you get when you fetch this node

00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,400
you get references to ids which in turn

00:06:55,039 --> 00:07:00,160
reference other ids

00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,160
so you get farther away from the content

00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:05,039
when i started working on how to add

00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:06,560
seek editor 5 decor

00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:08,560
i read a lot of documentation and

00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,160
examples and something that changed for

00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,360
me was realizing for all we talk about

00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,840
structured content

00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,520
we're mostly trying to solve layout or

00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,440
add a nice looking reusable component

00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:19,759
wherever we want on the page

00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:21,759
if we're still building html pages why

00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:22,960
not just make it easier to add html

00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:24,560
components

00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,560
they can be structured and they can

00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,080
avoid the div soup that we end up with

00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,319
in drupal sometimes with

00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:33,440
field and entity templates as they get

00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:33,440
nested deeper and deeper

00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:39,120
so to illustrate this i made a couple of

00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,120
simple plugins

00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:45,280
one of them is a card type layout

00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:46,479
with a title and a body i think this is

00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,160
a pretty common pattern

00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:50,400
my version of it may not be very pretty

00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,599
but it gets the idea across you have

00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,720
something where you want to be able to

00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:53,599
edit the title and you want to edit the

00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,960
body separately

00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:57,360
and that's a really common pattern you

00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,879
want to add to your site

00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,639
so the markup is set and it's

00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:02,400
unchangeable by a site builder

00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:04,319
and they don't need to know what markup

00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,240
or what class names to add where

00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,759
but a designer and a developer can work

00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,720
together to come up with a component

00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:11,840
like this

00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:13,440
and add it as an option for their client

00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:15,599
because the markup is known

00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:17,199
you can add css that targets it and you

00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:18,879
can have a simple and predictable but

00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:20,879
rich way to add something unique

00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:22,560
anywhere on the page without having to

00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:26,080
plan ahead with paragraph types and

00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:27,840
entity reference revision fields the

00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:30,560
second example was to take that same

00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,680
simple box or or card and instead of a

00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,320
title and a body

00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,279
i made two body text areas with just a

00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,320
little

00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:41,760
css and you have a simple responsive two

00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:43,200
column layout

00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:45,599
you could even add a card into the

00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,599
columns

00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,720
you can imagine building out a large

00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,640
component library over time

00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:57,040
or sharing these among your organization

00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:59,839
or even with the community

00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,560
all you're creating is markup and the ui

00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:03,279
of course

00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:05,040
so it's simple portable and flexible

00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:06,480
whatever css you add could completely

00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,160
change for each theme

00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,560
but the content creator always has a

00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:12,880
consistent experience

00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,000
and that seems pretty clean to me unless

00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,360
the paragraph would give you the same

00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,480
kind of markup on the page

00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,480
but it might be a lot more work

00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,920
and that markup doesn't have to be

00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:26,240
completely static either

00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:28,560
if you expose options in the ui and to

00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,839
the seek editor 5 config

00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,600
you can create a component that could

00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:33,920
serve different purposes on different

00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,920
sites

00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:39,920
if you had to describe this plugin you

00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,839
could use yaml for example

00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:44,000
it needs a label for the drop down menu

00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:45,760
and a modifier for the class name

00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,680
your plugin config could have as many or

00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:49,680
as few options as you need

00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,880
and once you built this plugin you could

00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,560
change this config

00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,880
and never need to edit any javascript

00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,880
again

00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:59,200
so to me this has an appealing

00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,560
simplicity creating a component and

00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,519
allowing it to be added right to the

00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,440
page

00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:05,040
now your editor is more of a ui for

00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,800
adding structured content than it is

00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,720
just a free text field editor

00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,920
it's pulling you away from dumping blobs

00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,000
of content on the page

00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,600
but it's still much more free simple and

00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,120
open than figuring out how to nest the

00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,160
right entity reference

00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,160
and if you're still concerned about

00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:20,079
having a lot of bloated markup in the

00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,839
body field

00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:24,640
consider how drupal already handles

00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,640
media elements

00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:29,680
so this is not valid html but drupal

00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,760
recognizes it

00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:34,079
the entity uuid tells drupal where to

00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:36,000
find the entity and the current format

00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:37,360
tells how to render it and this is

00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,839
exactly what we have to save in the

00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,839
database

00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:46,720
there's no view source button in

00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:49,200
category 5 because there's no source

00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,320
or rather the source it saves is not the

00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,800
same as the source

00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,680
you see when you're editing you're not

00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,680
seeing what you get

00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,720
you're editing content and it's saving

00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,560
html

00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:01,040
and not even the same html it's showing

00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:03,760
you maybe it's not even saving html

00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:05,519
at all one plugin for seek editor five

00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:08,000
transforms your output straight into

00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,000
markdown

00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,760
think again about that drupal media

00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:17,920
element the editor saves a preview

00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,959
but it's sorry the editor displays a

00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,040
preview

00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:22,560
but it saves really minimal markup that

00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,680
the front end whether it's drupal

00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:26,839
rendering the page

00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:29,120
or maybe some other web app knows how to

00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:30,720
display

00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,399
you're visually editing and you're

00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,680
placing content where you want it

00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:36,640
but that's not determining what you're

00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,640
saving to the database

00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,480
this is another example from the seek

00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:42,959
editor docs they're using react

00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,480
to render a list of products and you can

00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:46,320
add from that menu of products right

00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,880
into seek editor 5.

00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:52,000
the editor view is printing html and

00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:53,279
that's that top code example

00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,040
it's effectively adding a react

00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:56,720
component which is then rendered out as

00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,800
a product preview

00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,920
however the data which has saved the

00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:02,480
text area

00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,040
is nothing like that it's simply an

00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,399
element

00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:07,279
with enough info for some other

00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:07,279
front-end to render

00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:13,200
to me that element with a data attribute

00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,639
or a drupal media element

00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,959
they both look a little like web

00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:18,560
components i saw chris bloom and adam

00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:19,360
duran's excellent web components talk

00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,720
yesterday

00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,800
and it got me thinking that this could

00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,079
be something special you could visually

00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,320
add the components you want

00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:27,760
where you want but you save a simple

00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,920
element to the database

00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,880
and then some front end somewhere takes

00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,720
that element and

00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:38,720
renders it however it's appropriate for

00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:40,399
the application it ends up on

00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,160
so what if this takes off you could

00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:44,160
create web components or even just

00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,880
regular html components to reuse on your

00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,560
sites

00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:48,399
but the real power is when a community

00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,839
gets a hold of it adopts it and reaches

00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:51,360
a critical mass

00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:53,839
i think there's a lot of potential with

00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:56,160
adding seek editor 5 to drupal

00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:57,600
it's not just a necessary upgrade but

00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,480
something that could change how we build

00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,920
sites

00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,920
it's up to us to build the module in a

00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:03,600
way that makes it easy to add plugins so

00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:07,839
that developers and site builders

00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,839
can click together whatever they need

00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,040
so seek editor 5 as i mentioned is a

00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:15,279
completely new editor it's

00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:17,040
completely changed from canada 4. it

00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:18,480
features a custom data model which makes

00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:20,320
adding and changing text much more

00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:22,160
consistent and reliable so even

00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,240
something as simple as just typing and

00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:25,519
formatting content works better and

00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,959
feels better

00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:28,560
it has a robust plugin system for

00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:31,600
modifying almost any feature

00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:33,360
and altering or using any ui pattern but

00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,639
it wasn't certain that ck editor 5 was

00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,440
the obvious replacement for c

00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:39,199
editor and core so like with php 7 or

00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:41,680
composer 1 the next move is obvious

00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:43,199
but for ck editor is it there's other

00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:45,120
wysiwygs out there

00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:47,120
and since it's not a simple upgrade but

00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,000
a full replacement kind of like drupal 7

00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,600
to eight

00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,279
it's not so clear that we have to stay

00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,279
with zeke editor and upgrade to five

00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:57,199
so like all things in drupal this was a

00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,880
community discussion

00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:00,639
and at the end seek editor five was

00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,240
chosen for several reasons

00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:04,160
but notably because of the long and

00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:07,120
successful working relationship between

00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:08,800
ck source and the drupal community just

00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,920
to illustrate that point when i was

00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,240
working on a weird bug

00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:13,519
with required fields i ran across this

00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:17,519
issue

00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:19,600
from 10 years ago

00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:21,199
and i saw some familiar names there's

00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,720
whim and not

00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:24,639
commenting eight years ago and helping

00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,920
to fix this bug

00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:28,079
which eventually got landed by a

00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:30,079
pediatric so the thought that

00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:32,399
ck source would continue to be helpful

00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:33,920
has completely been validated as well

00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:35,600
that wasn't that was one of the

00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,399
justifications for choosing seek out

00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,480
five but it's

00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:40,079
already become true because geostrick is

00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,720
now the lead engineer on c character

00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:42,079
five

00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,000
and he and his team have been really

00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:45,920
helpful so far with frequent meetings

00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,120
they've jumped into drupal slack and

00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:50,079
even comment on

00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,079
issues in d.o

00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:56,240
it's not just a matter of swapping out

00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:58,560
javascript or replacing a module

00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:00,240
seek editor is deeply embedded in drupal

00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:02,560
connected through the editor system

00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:05,279
tied into quick edit and configured and

00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:06,560
managed by filters and text formats

00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:08,000
it also has a completely different

00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,480
plug-in system than together five does

00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,079
now

00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:12,079
and allowed for contributed modules to

00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:13,680
extend and alter it

00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:15,600
it's also raised questions of how we're

00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:17,760
going to handle using modern javascript

00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,440
apps in drupal

00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:21,040
seek editor 5 is written in modern

00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:24,399
javascript and all the packages

00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:26,000
are published in npm one big question

00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:27,760
early on was how are we going to add or

00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,639
remove plugins the way we're used to in

00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,399
drupal

00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:32,399
for example having a contributed project

00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:34,560
that adds its own plugin

00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:36,160
if you're using a custom build each

00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,519
plugin must be imported

00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:39,519
and then you would run a build step to

00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:42,959
get your compiled editor

00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,959
so how could this work in drupal

00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:46,160
so one huge change that the ck source

00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,480
team worked on

00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,519
was untangling the dependencies of each

00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,279
of their packages

00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:54,560
and using webpack to build the project

00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:57,120
into many smaller javascript files

00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:59,600
this made it possible to load individual

00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:01,360
javascript files that were pre-built

00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,600
or enabling another drupal module with

00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:05,839
its own javascript that can load with ck

00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,600
editor 5 without having to run

00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:09,600
a webpack command and compile a new

00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,880
build

00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,880
this made a massive difference for

00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:15,279
development and really made the drupal

00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:17,199
project possible

00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:19,279
you can see how now we can just add

00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:22,079
javascript files using drupal's existing

00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:23,920
library system to make this work

00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:25,440
rather than having to import javascript

00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:27,839
files compile them

00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,839
we're just adding compiled javascript as

00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:31,920
just a script tag

00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:33,680
so big thank you to the cksource team

00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:36,240
for even thinking of the solution

00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:38,320
and then doing all the work to implement

00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,320
it

00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,320
c category 5 was designed to be

00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:43,199
completely alterable with plugins from

00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,120
adding elements

00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:47,040
changing attributes or styles to

00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,639
outputting content as markdown

00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,320
when planning the drupal module a big

00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:52,480
goal was to make it as easy as possible

00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:54,480
for developers to add their own plugins

00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:57,279
for either adding features or modifying

00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,279
existing settings

00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:01,360
this annotation describes a drupal

00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:04,000
security 5 plugin

00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:06,000
it's a comment in a php file this is

00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,760
discoverable by the plugin manager

00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,039
and this is how pretty much every plugin

00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:11,760
in drupal works

00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:12,400
i struggle a bit because seek editor

00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,079
calls their

00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,839
extensions plugins and so does drupal

00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:18,000
interpret the whole plugin system

00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:19,760
and so this annotation is a drupalism

00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,959
and you'll see this a lot

00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:23,520
throughout drupal core and throughout

00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:25,199
your custom modules so this annotation

00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,319
is is automatically discoverable by the

00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:28,319
plugin manager

00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:30,559
and it has information about the library

00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:33,200
to include the js and css files

00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:35,200
it also has information on the plug-in

00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,720
classes that ckr needs to load

00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:40,400
and it can have static config which is

00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,400
passed in the c c editor at runtime

00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,880
if your plugin requires information from

00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:48,080
drupal for example

00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:49,760
the media preview url plugins provide a

00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:52,880
method for setting that config before it

00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:54,480
gets passed in the ck editor

00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,640
i personally think that the php

00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,200
annotation syntax is a bit difficult to

00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,080
read

00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:01,919
and parse it's also likely you don't

00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,480
need a php class the fetch settings or

00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:04,480
contain

00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,600
config from drupal for most seek editor

00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,600
plugins

00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:09,600
maybe the majority of the functionality

00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:11,200
of the plugin is already in javascript

00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:14,400
and all you really need to do

00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:16,400
is to tell it to load

00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,240
if that's the case that exact same

00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,600
annotation could be written in yaml

00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,360
instead

00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,799
i think this is much easier to read and

00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,600
write and if you're a javascript

00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:25,039
developer

00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:27,120
you may be happy not to have to write

00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:28,559
any php at all

00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,640
on the other hand if your module is

00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:31,679
changing an existing plugins config

00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:34,160
maybe you don't need to write any

00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:35,440
javascript either you could make a form

00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:38,559
to save and edit these settings instead

00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,559
of hard cutting them in yaml

00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:43,039
you can also write the annotation in

00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:44,080
yaml and then point to a php class if

00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:45,440
you still need one

00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,720
that's kind of the best of both worlds

00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,520
because you don't have to write the php

00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,280
annotation

00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:52,400
but you still can write custom php if

00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:54,080
you need information from drupal

00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,520
in the seek editor 5 module there's

00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,440
examples of all three

00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:59,039
annotation that's just on yaml

00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,240
annotation that's in yaml with plug-in

00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:04,160
code and php

00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:04,160
and then everything in a single php file

00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:09,440
so all together in a drupal module that

00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,880
provides the sequential five plugin

00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,400
this is just a contributed module i

00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,600
created called layer cake it provides

00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,600
the two plugins that i

00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:17,280
demoed earlier the little card and the

00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:19,280
two column layout

00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,640
so this this drupal module includes

00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:23,440
everything that you need to

00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:25,280
to add that into drupal it has an info

00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,559
file that tells drupal about the module

00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,799
it has a libraries file that tells

00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:31,039
drupal where the javascript and css are

00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:33,840
and then the caditor.yaml file defines

00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:33,840
the plugin itself

00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,559
so the info.yaml file is familiar to you

00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,600
if you've ever made a drupal module

00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:40,480
the only important part here is that

00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:43,120
we're adding a dependency on the

00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:44,400
category 5 module

00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:46,000
the library's file looks a bit more

00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,440
complicated but most of it is just

00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,559
documenting where the source code is

00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,679
from

00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:51,280
i'm telling drupal where to find the

00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:52,000
javascript in the javascript build

00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,600
folder

00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,600
and listing the location of the repo for

00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,960
developer the javascript should not be

00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,080
pre-processed by drupal and it's already

00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:01,919
minified

00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:01,919
i'm also adding a little css here too

00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,720
the ckeditor.yaml file contains the

00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:08,240
actual plugin definition

00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,880
i'm pointing to the library i just

00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:12,400
defined in the library.yaml

00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,679
i'm adding the plugins by their package

00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,120
name and their class name which i'll

00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:16,480
talk about in a minute

00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,840
two of our items in admin library are

00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,640
additional config just for the toolbar

00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,000
ui

00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,080
and elements are to help validate

00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,760
drupal's html filter so that if it's

00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:25,840
enabled we can add these elements and

00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:28,880
attributes to an allow list so that they

00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,880
can be rendered on the page

00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:33,120
to briefly explain the seeker 5 plugin

00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:35,120
structure i created a repo that includes

00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:36,559
two examples of ck5 plugins that you

00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:38,559
call in the simple box

00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:40,400
the index.js file exports those two

00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:43,280
classes

00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:44,880
simple box and two call in webpack

00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,360
besides pointing to where the sticker 5

00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:48,000
repo

00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:49,280
is so that the imports make sense i name

00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,880
the package

00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:52,880
this means my plugins can be referred to

00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,840
by the package and their class

00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:56,159
so you see that layer cake.2 call and

00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:58,640
layercake.simplebox

00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:03,840
that becomes what i actually add into

00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:03,840
the yaml under the plugin list

00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:07,919
once you've compiled your javascript the

00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:10,480
drupal module is mostly metadata

00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:11,840
so the hope is that it makes adding new

00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,440
plugins straightforward

00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,880
without needing to learn a lot about

00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,000
drupal

00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,919
if we're going to build a healthy

00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,600
ecosystem of contributed modules

00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:22,080
the main module needs to do all the

00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:23,600
heavy lifting and also set good examples

00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:26,240
for how to build plugins that integrate

00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,240
with drupal

00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:31,360
so where are we now with that main

00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,919
module the plan is to get secretary 5 in

00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,400
core

00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:35,840
and stable for drupal 10 but that means

00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:39,120
it really needs to be in core

00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:40,480
at least in beta by 9.3 or 9.4 at the

00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:42,000
latest

00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:44,400
the original word for this project was

00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,000
right in core as an issue fork but after

00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,840
some time it became complex enough that

00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:51,520
it was hard to keep track of what had

00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:51,520
been done and what was remaining

00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:55,280
we decided to follow in the footsteps of

00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:57,679
giants layout builder

00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:59,200
json api and media all began to contrib

00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:00,480
and move to core once they were close to

00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,000
stable

00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,520
working on a contrib project also gave

00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,320
us our own issue queue and a consistent

00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,720
workflow

00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:08,159
with the new merge requests it is

00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:10,320
functional but it's still missing some

00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:12,320
important features to match ck4

00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:14,320
and we want people to use it and try to

00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:15,679
extend it so we can solve the problems

00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:17,039
early and make sure that by the time

00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:20,000
it's in drupal 10 there's a healthy

00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:21,120
ecosystem around it

00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,559
with the module installed you can

00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:24,480
navigate to a text format and add

00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:25,919
category 5 as your text editor

00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:28,400
we built a new toolbar ui with no

00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:29,679
dependency on jquery or backbone

00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:32,640
you can use it to drag and drop the

00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:34,240
toolbar items you want for this format

00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:36,080
it was also built with accessibility in

00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:38,240
mind and supports keyboard movement for

00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:40,000
adding removing and sorting buttons

00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:43,360
and aria live announcements to describe

00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,720
the current status and options

00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:46,960
seek editor 5 is integrated with the

00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,760
format page plugins can be made aware of

00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,200
filter settings

00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:51,600
for example if you have the media module

00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:53,520
enabled and you check the embed media

00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:55,520
it will activate the category 5 drupal

00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:57,360
media plugin which supports that element

00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:58,960
and if you check allow image uploads it

00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:02,320
will enable you to add an image inline

00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:03,679
to the content and change other settings

00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:06,159
i mentioned this because we wanted to

00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:06,720
make integration with the form format

00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:08,559
page

00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:10,159
much more simple than it had been before

00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:11,679
so drupal security five plugins are

00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:13,679
designed to make validation warnings

00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:17,039
as well easier to set up without having

00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:17,039
to write any form alters

00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,880
we already added a lot of the basic

00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:23,440
plugins such as bold metallic

00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,799
strikethrough and block quote and

00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:26,080
whenever possible we're using seek

00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:28,960
editor 5's improvements

00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:29,440
such as on a link href uh you get the

00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,200
little

00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:32,480
balloon pop-up in my opinion it's a

00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,919
little bit of an improvement over

00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,360
drupal's dialogue overlay

00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:38,159
which you can see in the c category 4

00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:38,159
example on the left

00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:42,400
like media entities inserted images get

00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:44,480
data entity uuid attributes so the

00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,679
drupal can keep track of its assets

00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,440
inserting an image can be done by

00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:50,640
browsing for an image on your computer

00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:52,240
again no dialogue used here

00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:54,720
or even with drag and drop directly from

00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,720
your computer

00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:59,679
seek editor 5 also supports adding

00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:59,679
multiple images at once

00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,640
we created our own seeker 5 plugin for

00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:06,320
parsing drupal media elements

00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:08,000
in the editor view the plugin uses

00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:09,200
drupal to fetch a media preview to

00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,559
display in the editor

00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,400
which is held in a special type of

00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:14,720
category 5 container called a raw

00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:16,240
element

00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,559
and that displays exactly as it renders

00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:20,080
to the page

00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:22,000
if you enable the media library toolbar

00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:24,240
button you can insert drupal media

00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,600
right into the editor by letting you

00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:28,240
browse media library

00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:29,840
you can select any existing entity this

00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:33,520
does use the dialog so sometimes

00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:35,279
drupal's ui is still the best choice

00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:38,080
seek editor 5 has different builds the

00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:39,440
classic editor which we used on nodes

00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:41,760
the balloon editor which looks a lot

00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,559
like quick edit but for quick edit we

00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,240
actually use their

00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:45,919
decoupled editor which lets us add the

00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,799
toolbar ui separately from the editable

00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:48,480
area

00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:50,400
so now you can click quick edit click a

00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51,679
text area field and you'll have the same

00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,720
controls in quick edit like you would

00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:56,000
from it

00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:56,000
and using the node edit one

00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:00,080
there's lots more plugins you can browse

00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:01,679
together to find docs or search npm for

00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:03,600
seek editor 5 to see other plugins that

00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:05,200
are available

00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:08,080
there's probably some we should add now

00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:09,520
like special characters or a table

00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:11,039
there's also new plugins that were not

00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:12,080
available in category 4 such as the

00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:14,159
to-do list

00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:16,320
or restricted editing for creating forms

00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:17,600
or repeatable content like invoices

00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:20,159
these could be great candidates for

00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:21,600
contrib projects

00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:23,919
some of the most exciting features are

00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:25,279
paid services provided by cksource

00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:26,880
imagine working on the same node with

00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:29,039
multiple colleagues at once and having

00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:30,720
your changes auto saved

00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:32,320
or leaving comments for reviewers to

00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,960
discuss changes right inside drupal

00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,559
attempting

00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:36,320
or sorry accepting or rejecting

00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:37,520
suggestions just like you would in

00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,960
google docs

00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:42,000
there are a lot of possibilities that we

00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:43,120
haven't even touched yet

00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,640
if you like some of the ideas i've

00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,120
proposed or you're interested in getting

00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,559
started

00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:49,760
either using seek editor 5 or writing

00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:51,360
your own plugins we need to move quickly

00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:53,200
the drupal community has kept ck editor

00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,080
updated in core both keeping up with new

00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,360
releases

00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:58,159
and adding features that get out of

00:25:55,360 --> 00:26:00,320
decor like media library integration

00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:01,760
but all good things come to an end seek

00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:03,520
editor 4 itself will have long term

00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:05,440
support until 2023

00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:07,279
which means anyone running drupal 8 or 9

00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,720
will be able to continue to get security

00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:10,080
fixes

00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,440
however for drupal's life cycle that

00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:13,679
actually is one of the factors for the

00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:15,039
forced end of life of 2.09

00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:17,039
dries and others have explained this

00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:18,640
better than i could but for drupal 10 we

00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:19,279
must have all the software removed from

00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,200
core

00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:22,720
more specifically to deprecate ck editor

00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,279
and core in time to remove it for drupal

00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,679
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:27,440
we must have a viable replacement by 9.3

00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:28,799
or 9.4 at the latest

00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:30,559
then there's thousands of sites running

00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:31,919
together that need a migration path

00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:34,320
we don't want to leave any drupal sites

00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:35,919
behind d9 has committed us to easy

00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,799
upgrades forever so we need a path

00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:38,320
forward

00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:39,919
we have about a month to get the seeker

00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:41,200
to 5 module ready for beta

00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:44,640
and landed in course that we can

00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,640
deprecate seek editor by the fall

00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:50,080
with seeker 5 we don't only have to

00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:51,919
think in terms of html but rather focus

00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:53,200
on a good user experience it can provide

00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:54,720
and come up with some creative ways to

00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:56,000
empower content creators to make the

00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:57,279
layout that they need without worrying

00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,559
about implementation

00:26:57,279 --> 00:27:00,159
so i hope you saw some features that

00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:01,200
made you optimistic or inspired to get

00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:02,960
involved

00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,799
um chat anytime in dribble socket seek

00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:06,080
editor 5 or jump in the issue queue or

00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:06,960
make a contrib project and let me know

00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:09,279
how it goes

00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,279
thank you

00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:19,600
i think we have a little time for q a i

00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,799
saw there's a ton of chat it's really

00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:23,760
hard to do a presentation with hopkin

00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:23,760
because you have so much to look at

00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:32,880
um so ryan asks what if the client is

00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,240
the site builder

00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,760
the content owner submits content to

00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:37,760
site builder then they determine how

00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:40,799
best to promote the content

00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:41,919
um content owner submits content to site

00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:43,600
builder

00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:45,200
yeah i mean i think that's sort of the

00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,960
goal here is that you're empowering your

00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:48,880
site builders to bake these things with

00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:50,640
sort of low code solutions like you can

00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:52,399
create a component that that is reusable

00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:54,159
and um or

00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:55,840
create any sort of plugin that fits your

00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:59,279
content needs

00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:59,279
um let's see

00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,919
um nick asks can you access any of that

00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,720
data in queries though like with

00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:06,480
paragraphs

00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:08,320
or is it the same issues seek editor for

00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:09,840
plugins like the media entity and embeds

00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:11,360
um yeah i think that's the idea that

00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,840
you're still you're you still are

00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:14,240
creating

00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:17,760
a blog of text you're still creating a

00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:18,960
chunk of content but it's um

00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:20,240
in some ways i think it's simpler but

00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,600
maybe you can't access it in the same

00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,760
way that you would where

00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:25,760
you dive in with media elements though

00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:27,760
um with media entity of course you can

00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:29,360
make a view of media entities anywhere

00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:31,679
else

00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:33,039
um want to integrate layouts with

00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:34,640
paragraphs for a better ui

00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:35,840
i think there is a module for that i

00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,720
think there's layout paragraphs if

00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,880
you're interested in that kind of

00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:40,240
structure it says

00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:43,279
um the content will be structured and

00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:45,360
more importantly configurable

00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:47,120
um content so john asks what are

00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:48,320
trade-offs between seek editor five and

00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:52,159
layout builder

00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:53,679
um i think i think that uh

00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:55,760
you could accomplish goals in lots of

00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:56,880
different ways in drupal um i would

00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:59,039
i would think that if you're gonna use

00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,320
category 5 maybe my examples could be a

00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:01,520
bit contrived or maybe you could think

00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:03,279
of some better ones but

00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:05,039
the idea is that you could create

00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:06,159
elements that um that would look good

00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:08,000
within a single

00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:09,520
field or in it within a single body text

00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,880
whereas with layout builder you can

00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:12,240
arrange fields on the page and

00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:14,240
eventually be able to arrange blocks

00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:16,640
everywhere as well

00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:18,159
um kevin asks is this compatible with

00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:19,600
web components

00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:21,440
uh yeah so that's kind of what i was

00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,960
getting at is i thought that you could

00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,919
create your own web components and save

00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:25,679
them and

00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:26,960
and it seems like it would be a way

00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:28,159
forward and it's kind of an exciting

00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:30,240
possibility

00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:32,960
um and i'd definitely be eager to talk

00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,960
to you more about that

00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:37,600
um chilean asks what kind of migration

00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:41,840
will be required for sites that have

00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:41,840
used together for

00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:46,960
so migration is the tricky part because

00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,559
you have to think about your

00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:50,799
html that you have on your page so if

00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:52,320
you have very very plain ordinary html

00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:54,320
then the migration should be

00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:55,840
fairly straightforward if you have very

00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:57,520
complex html

00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:59,840
very custom stuff like divs with class

00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:02,240
names uh you may have a tougher time

00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,880
the ck editor cksource team is working

00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,880
on some

00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,919
on a migration path because it's a

00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,440
really important issue for their

00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:08,480
customers as well as for all the drupal

00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,679
people and so that's

00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:11,840
something that they're actively working

00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:11,840
on

00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:17,120
christoph asks how would tokens be made

00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:22,640
available from these plugins

00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:23,679
um i'm not sure i guess we could

00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:26,320
we'd have to make a plug-in that

00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:27,440
supported it i'm not sure i know that's

00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,320
kind of a weak answer but i think that

00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:30,080
you could um

00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:31,520
it's not something that that we have an

00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:34,000
answer for at the moment but it's still

00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:37,200
in active development

00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,720
um frank asks about seek editor 5 sounds

00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,159
exactly like gutenberg

00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:42,000
and there's also an existing gutenberg

00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:43,520
contrib module um

00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,600
you can check that issue that i posted

00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:47,760
um where there's the discussion

00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,640
on deciding between category 5 and other

00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:50,799
options

00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:52,640
gutenberg was brought up there um but i

00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:54,000
think that one of the reasons they chose

00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:55,679
not to go with gutenberg is because it's

00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,519
sort of a drastic departure from

00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:59,279
uh from what we have already and so we

00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:01,679
wanted to make this upgrade as smooth as

00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:01,679
possible

00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:05,840
um

00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:20,240
there's a ton more questions um i'll

00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:22,559
just keep answering them

00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,559
um

00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:27,360
sorry i lost my place uh is it still

00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:30,840
possible to use

00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:32,640
seek editor 5 for users to break html

00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:34,960
markup

00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:36,240
um it's impossible for ckr5 for users to

00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:37,840
bring html market

00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:40,080
and when deleting or clearing stylized

00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:42,159
market um i

00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:43,600
i don't think so i mean because if the

00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:45,360
idea is that secure five and

00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:47,360
it parses the html that's in the

00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:51,039
existing html and so if

00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:54,480
there was some some stylized markup

00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:55,919
um yeah i'm not super clear on that

00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,960
question but i think it

00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:58,080
in general if you're creating new

00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:00,000
content once you get your five you're

00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:01,200
gonna have a much more reliable

00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,399
result you're not going to have to worry

00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:04,399
about broken html

00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:08,960
ryan asks how can i fully trust the

00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:10,080
wysiwyg i need to see how the code gets

00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:12,080
parsed so i can determine if it's

00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:13,679
semantic and accessible

00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:15,679
if for example if the editor outputs a

00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:17,679
span when i intended for an h2

00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:19,200
um yeah that's a that's a great question

00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:19,519
and i think that the the answer is that

00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,279
the

00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:22,960
seeker five is much more reliable in

00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:26,399
terms of its its document model

00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:28,000
and how it outputs data um

00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:29,360
and of course you can always see how the

00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,840
code gets parsed and you know it's going

00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,840
to be

00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:33,679
the same every time um there's a lot of

00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:34,080
ways of getting the data out of testing

00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:35,519
it

00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:37,120
um you can also write your own plugins

00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:40,000
for for making sure that the output is

00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:41,919
exactly what you expect

00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,440
um john asks will see cathedral have a

00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:45,679
contrib module for d10

00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:47,039
um yeah i think that's that's a good

00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:49,440
that is the plan because

00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:50,480
we don't want to uh take away anybody's

00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,039
experiences and we want to make sure

00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:53,200
that the

00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:55,039
force is available we just want to make

00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,840
sure that it's deprecated in drupal 9 so

00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:58,480
that we can

00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:59,679
not have to support it in drupal 10. but

00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,960
if you want to add it to your own site

00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:03,120
then absolutely we did the same thing

00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:04,880
with jquery ui we had a lot of jquery ui

00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:11,840
contrib projects as we're removing it

00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:11,840
from core

00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:17,360
i keep clicking back to chat and i'm

00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:19,200
losing my place um

00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:21,039
leonardo asks i use custom javascript

00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:22,399
and css code on custom blocks

00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:24,640
but then i can apply the different

00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:26,320
sections or pages within the layout

00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:28,000
how can we achieve this if category 5

00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:30,000
doesn't have a source button

00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,279
um and i'm not sure if this is exactly

00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,159
what you mean but that's that's sort of

00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:33,519
what i was trying to get at with

00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:35,279
creating your own

00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:36,880
uh components that if you create your

00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:38,000
own custom blocks

00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:40,480
and you want to apply to different

00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,919
sections you can

00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:44,159
create a little plug-in for that that

00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:45,919
you can then inject right into your

00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:47,840
into your editor so you rather than

00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:49,840
pasting it as source you're actually

00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:53,279
creating it in advance and then making a

00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:54,880
way to insert that

00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:56,320
frank asks how can you can you explain

00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:58,240
how seek editor blocks

00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:59,679
work so everyone understands how content

00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:02,399
is stored as a structured block

00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:03,360
and not html which is why it isn't

00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:06,399
source editable

00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:08,000
so it is still stored as html um

00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:09,679
i mean i suppose you can as i mentioned

00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,200
there's plugins for for outputting

00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:13,119
your content in different formats like

00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:16,320
you could have markdown instead

00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:18,159
um but in just by default it's storing

00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:21,839
html and so

00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:21,839
um it is still

00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:26,399
i i suppose you could always just turn

00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:28,159
together off on on your field and

00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:29,520
still be able to edit the source because

00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:31,359
the html is still being saved in the

00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:33,200
database

00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:34,800
uh nathan asks would the page layout

00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:36,399
break if the content editor changes the

00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,440
input filter from c category to full

00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:39,359
html

00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:41,280
sometimes view source is useful how can

00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:42,879
a content editor manually edit html if

00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:45,440
the media rises

00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:45,440
so the

00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:50,320
there is a warning now so if you switch

00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:52,159
from from restricted to full html

00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:53,839
um you do get a warning already that you

00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:56,639
could be breaking your content

00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:58,160
um the the real issue is whether full

00:34:56,639 --> 00:35:00,400
html allows

00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:01,839
more content than ck editor does and so

00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,800
if you had your seek editor on a basic

00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:04,560
html

00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:06,240
and you switched to full and then you

00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:08,079
went in and added source

00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:10,000
and then flip back you might you might

00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:11,359
have some trouble with that content but

00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,880
if you just stick with seek editor i

00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:13,599
think that you won't have to worry about

00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:16,320
editing your

00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:17,440
html manually and i hope that like one

00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,880
of the points i was trying to get across

00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:20,320
in this talk is that

00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:21,760
is that you should hopefully not have to

00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:23,200
think about the html that you're

00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,920
inserting into the wizard because you've

00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,760
already

00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:28,800
you know planned it in advance and you

00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:28,800
know exactly what it's going to be

00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:33,280
josh asks um he said you see you said

00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:34,640
ck5 works with the media library

00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:36,480
does it allow linking the documents in

00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:39,119
the media library inline by default

00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:45,839
that's been a big bug in the ck4 i think

00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:45,839
the documents in the library online um

00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:49,680
i guess i'm not quite sure what you mean

00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:51,280
by that uh but yeah if if it's not doing

00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,839
what you expected to then please open an

00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:53,200
issue in

00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:55,119
the module right now we're able to

00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:57,440
browse the media library and

00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:58,400
uh and just inject content right into

00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:00,640
the

00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:02,000
into the text area but if uh if you see

00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:05,599
an issue with it then

00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,599
feel free to create a bug report

00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,480
michael asks are these media entities

00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:09,920
automatically created in the media

00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:11,599
library for the images that are dragged

00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:13,680
and dropped in c character

00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:15,839
um yeah so i cheated a bit by using the

00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:16,720
umami installations the mommy profile

00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:19,040
already has

00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:21,040
a bunch of immediate entities created um

00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:23,520
and so if you create those elsewhere

00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:24,240
uh you can you can insert them anywhere

00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:27,440
and then

00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:29,520
and then insert them right in c category

00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:30,720
um anonymous asks why would we choose to

00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:32,560
continue with the next version of an

00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:33,920
editor which has forced us to edit html

00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:35,520
for years and has forced us to teach

00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:38,640
html to our clients

00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:40,000
um well you're welcome to turn it off i

00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:41,760
suppose uh i think that

00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,200
i'm hoping that the new versions

00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:45,520
together um

00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:47,040
will make life easier for your clients

00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:48,079
and you won't have to teach them html

00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,599
anymore

00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:51,280
um on the other hand if they'd like to

00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:52,240
edit some of their own plugins they can

00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,599
create their own

00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:57,200
markup and make something that's a

00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:59,200
useful and repeatable uh component

00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:01,680
um luke asks is there a better mechanism

00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:04,320
to apply block styles in ck5

00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:05,200
um i'm i'm not going to click the link

00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:08,560
right now but

00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:09,920
uh there's there's some things that

00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,480
there's like automatic mechanisms like

00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,920
there's a

00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:14,160
plugin called link decorators and you

00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:15,839
can do things like if a link is to a pdf

00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:17,200
you can automatically add a class

00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:19,200
um and so there's a lot of programmatic

00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:23,119
things you can do for applying styles

00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:24,560
um and then um and then yeah like i said

00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:25,520
you can you can create your own uh

00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:28,480
components

00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:28,800
for whatever you need uh ben asks where

00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:31,200
does

00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:33,040
seek editor end and layout builder begin

00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:34,800
seems the lines will become fuzzy

00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:36,480
um and yeah and maybe that's my fault

00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:37,760
for for using a layout example but i

00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:39,520
wanted to just give an idea of what you

00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:41,920
could accomplish with seek editor

00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:43,440
um i think that layout builder is still

00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:45,119
going to serve its main purpose for

00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:48,320
you know laying out laying out an entire

00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:50,560
page with seek editor it's just about

00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:52,960
controlling and having more uh power

00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:54,400
within the body field

00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:56,160
um and then that's why i publish the

00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:57,520
slides uh yes i definitely will sorry i

00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:58,720
haven't done that yet

00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:01,280
but i have it in google slides and it's

00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:03,040
ready to go um

00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:04,640
anthony asks are there thoughts to have

00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:05,280
media browser as the default media and

00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:07,440
better

00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:08,320
media is fine for individual users with

00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,760
organizations

00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:11,920
organizations with several users as

00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:13,760
media is often shared

00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:15,839
yes absolutely there's a there's an open

00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:18,160
issue about migrating inline images

00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:20,320
that's an existing features together for

00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:22,000
the predated media library

00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:24,079
and so there's there is actually an

00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:27,040
issue already in our project

00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:28,480
to make inline images automatically

00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:30,240
create a media element

00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:32,400
and then eventually migrate that over to

00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:33,680
just media so i think the long-term plan

00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:36,160
is that media browser

00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:36,720
and media library excuse me uh is is

00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,079
going to be

00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:42,400
standard and core and it'll be something

00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:42,400
we can count on and use that by default

00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:46,400
um james asked without view source how

00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:48,400
do we support use cases where content

00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:52,160
gets broken by pasting content

00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:52,640
um that's yeah that's tricky for sure um

00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:55,760
but

00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:57,680
the category 5 does support better

00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:59,440
pace from word and so hopefully you'll

00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:00,960
be able to uh to work around that it'll

00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:02,160
also clean it up automatically for you

00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:04,320
because whenever it's

00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:05,839
importing html it matches it to the

00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:07,520
document model that it has and so

00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:08,880
you may not be able to accomplish every

00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:10,240
single thing that you have in word but

00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:13,040
in general you'll

00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:16,079
be able to paste it in and have a layout

00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:17,839
that's it's a bit cleaner

00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:19,599
um yeah and then the same question from

00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:22,880
michael cooper about cleanly pasting

00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:22,880
from word um

00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:27,280
yeah i think i think we'll just have to

00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:28,480
try that out and see how the new canada

00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:30,079
five uh word

00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:32,160
word paste works and see if it's any

00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:33,680
better um

00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:35,359
max asked without view source how does

00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:36,720
one move around or reorder embedded

00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:38,000
entities within the lizzy wig sometimes

00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:39,119
makes this extremely finicky or

00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,520
impossible

00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:42,480
um so i found that it works a bit better

00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:44,560
than than ck

00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:45,680
before in terms of like you can you can

00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:47,200
click on something and then

00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:49,119
cut and paste the whole element so like

00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:50,480
that card example i showed um you can

00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:52,560
actually cut and paste an entire card

00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:54,000
with title and body already filled in

00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:55,440
same thing with media elements you can

00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
click the little button to add a new

00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:58,480
line below

00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,880
it i'm sorry i think the ui has improved

00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,880
quite a bit

00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:05,920
um leonardo s together doesn't let you

00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:08,480
write javascript code then

00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:10,400
um this is sad well i mean you can

00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:12,640
absolutely write all the javascript

00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,440
you want with ck editor you can um you

00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:15,599
can really go

00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:16,960
go nuts uh writing javascript for the ck

00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:18,880
editor um but

00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:20,720
as far as injecting together right into

00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:21,839
the editor i don't think that would be a

00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:25,280
good idea

00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:26,480
um and yeah and extra am posted as well

00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:29,440
you don't want to we don't want to

00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:32,800
enable xss as a feature

00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:34,319
um tracking use of media entities um

00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,520
i'm not an expert on that but i believe

00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:36,560
that that's that's something you can

00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:38,160
already do in core

00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:40,720
um and that's one of the reasons that we

00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:43,760
have data and the attributes on

00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:44,720
media and image elements that get added

00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:47,760
to

00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:49,200
body fields um

00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:50,720
yeah and then frank also says how are we

00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:52,079
gonna allow our clients to write xss if

00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:54,160
we cannot write javascript yeah i'm

00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:56,079
sorry frank

00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:57,440
you can open a feature request we want

00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:58,960
to make sure that happens but we'll

00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:02,240
probably won't work on it

00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:04,160
um anyway well thank you very much

00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:06,480
there's uh there's a contrib

00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:08,240
session uh contrib event contribution

00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:09,839
event this afternoon or

00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:11,599
for me it's this afternoon from some of

00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:14,480
you maybe this tonight

00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:14,960
um and i'd like to see some of you there

00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:17,040
and and

00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:18,079
you can also jump into slack and chat

00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:19,920
with you there and

00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:22,160
um hopefully some of your ideas and some

00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:24,720
of your concerns we can address either

00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:25,920
uh through new plugins or through bug

00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:27,839
fixes or

00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:29,280
um or whatever you can think of so i'm

00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:35,839
looking forward to talking to you more

00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:35,839
about it

00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:51,040
