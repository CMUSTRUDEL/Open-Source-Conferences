great

00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:06,799
all right so we're at time i think i'm

00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:10,080
going to go ahead and get started

00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:13,599
um because

00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:17,279
this is only a 15-minute demo so

00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:19,439
thanks for everybody who's here

00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:21,439
we're going to talk today about how we

00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:23,439
can use drupal to

00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:24,480
give our editors the ability to manually

00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:26,880
curate

00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,800
search results within solar so my name

00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:32,000
is martin anderson quits

00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,920
on drupal.org and twitter

00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,040
and various other social platforms i go

00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,200
by madclue

00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:40,800
and i work at northern which was

00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:43,120
formerly known as digital echidna

00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,559
so the first question you might have is

00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,239
is search really that important to my

00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:47,920
website and actually for

00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:49,680
a variety of users it really is quite

00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,600
important so

00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,840
if your site is very technical then

00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,600
people who land there may not have

00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,520
enough of a domain knowledge to sort of

00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,039
parse out how to navigate to the content

00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,879
that they're looking for and so

00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:02,239
quite often they will revert to using

00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:04,159
site search

00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:06,080
also you may have visitors who are very

00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:09,040
task oriented or transactional

00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:10,880
so think about somebody who's been your

00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,000
site before and saw some content that

00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,439
they want to get back to

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,200
but can't necessarily remember how they

00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:17,920
got there or maybe

00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,840
they've been um going through a process

00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,119
of looking at different products and now

00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,880
they've decided that they're ready to

00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:24,560
buy and they've come to your site to

00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,159
buy the product that they've seen but

00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,040
again they don't necessarily remember

00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:28,720
exactly

00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,320
the path to navigate there and so

00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:32,000
they're oftentimes

00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:35,840
going to revert to using search is the

00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,840
quickest way to get to that product

00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,240
this is a tweet i saw recently i thought

00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,159
it's kind of relevant because what it

00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:44,880
speaks to is the idea that you can

00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:46,640
create a really compelling product page

00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,840
you can write some content that's really

00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,360
helpful

00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,439
but if the people who are looking for

00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,280
that content can't find it

00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:54,880
then it may as well not even be on your

00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,719
site and so

00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,399
um as much as it's important to make

00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:59,680
sure that the content is really good on

00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:01,520
your site also making sure that the

00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,799
people who are looking for that content

00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,280
are able to find it is going to be

00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:07,520
really really important

00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,560
so the next question you may have is do

00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,640
i really need to

00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,640
offer my editors this ability to sort of

00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:14,000
manually curate those search results and

00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,760
there's a couple of answers to that the

00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,319
first one being that

00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:21,200
many competing search solutions already

00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:23,520
offer that out of the box so

00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,840
if a site was using swift type or kludo

00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,280
or ad search or a variety of others

00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,440
they would have that capability and

00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,680
since solar actually has

00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,800
attributes built in to support this kind

00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,319
of behavior

00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,920
there's really no reason why we

00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:37,920
shouldn't you know offer the same

00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,280
capability through solar

00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,959
and then the other answer is that quite

00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,120
often science our clients

00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:45,280
want that control so they may have a

00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:48,959
subject matter expert who would say

00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:50,640
you know for this uh top uh search query

00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,120
that people are are searching for on our

00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,040
site

00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,800
um what they really should be seeing is

00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,160
the first result is this white paper we

00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,200
just published that's you know very

00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,519
authoritative and

00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,920
all of those kinds of things and sure

00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:02,720
maybe over the long term the solution is

00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,159
to

00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,440
you know do some relevance tuning or

00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:07,200
something like that to make sure that

00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:09,680
that the right things are showing up

00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,280
at the top but in the short term to sort

00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,959
of close that gap and again

00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,800
make sure that that people are finding

00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:17,040
the best information available

00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,720
uh having a tool like this to act

00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:21,120
sometimes even as a stopgap could be

00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,400
really really helpful

00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,239
so the solution that we're going to talk

00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,159
about today is using this

00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:28,080
search overrides module which has been

00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:29,920
around for a couple of years now

00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,000
and it really is designed to give

00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,000
editors this capability of being able to

00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,200
specifically choose individual pieces of

00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,879
content to either

00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:39,120
promote to the top of the results or

00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:42,239
remove from the results

00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:44,159
entirely for specific queries and then

00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:45,680
not only to be able to choose which

00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,640
results are at the top but also

00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,440
specifically in what

00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:51,360
order and finally it gives them the

00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,080
ability to do this management directly

00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,959
within the

00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,760
node edit interface so instead of having

00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,599
to go to

00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:59,280
you know some place within the overall

00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:00,720
configuration menu where they have to

00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,280
remember to go to to do this kind of

00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,879
work

00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,439
if they're working on a piece of content

00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:07,040
they can specify specific queries where

00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:10,080
it should be at the top or excluded

00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:12,560
and all of those kinds of things

00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,280
so that being said let's go ahead and

00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,840
jump into

00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,840
a demo

00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,440
so the site that we're looking at is a

00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:22,479
drupal 9 site

00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:24,160
i set up specifically for this demo it

00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:25,919
doesn't have a lot of content in there

00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:29,040
but a lot of what's here

00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:31,199
is specifically about zebras

00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,960
so you can see i've got some different

00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,840
pieces of content that i put in from

00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:37,600
various sites

00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:39,120
around the web most of it's about zebra

00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,040
zebras but you can see that when we

00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,160
search zebra we also get this result for

00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,880
zebra mussels which

00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:47,360
may not be one that we want to keep as

00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:49,120
part of the result set for that query

00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,960
and for the sake of this demo let's say

00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,600
that we want this live site

00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:55,199
live science uh result to be our top

00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,040
results so let's go up to our

00:04:55,199 --> 00:05:00,960
configuration menu

00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:02,880
okay search and over to search overrides

00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,720
and then here we can just say add an

00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:07,840
override

00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:10,880
set our query as zebra let's look for

00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:12,240
some content that we want to promote

00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,500
live science was the one we said we

00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,720
wanted to promote and

00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:16,880
[Music]

00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,639
let's also say that we want to exclude

00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:21,919
that zebra muscle

00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:22,720
so when we save that it gives us sort of

00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:25,840
a preview

00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:27,680
of what's been saved and then if we go

00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:30,720
back over here

00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:32,320
and refresh our results you can see live

00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,240
science is at the top

00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:36,080
and that muscle result is nowhere to be

00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:39,120
found

00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,919
now imagine that as an editor i'm going

00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,880
in to

00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:44,400
edit this particular piece of content

00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,680
and now we can see over here on the

00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,960
sidebar

00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,720
you have this capability to manage where

00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,800
or for which queries this particular

00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:55,360
piece of content is going to be promoted

00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:58,800
or excluded so we can say

00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,919
zebra we want that one added as a top

00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,000
result

00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:03,840
and suppose that i was adding in a

00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,199
paragraph to the content that

00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:09,120
sort of mentions in passing squids

00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:10,400
we might say that still doesn't

00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,720
necessarily make it

00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:14,400
really relevant to that particular query

00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,960
so we could set that as something to be

00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,960
excluded

00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:23,360
and because i know that there's already

00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:25,120
um another node that's being promoted

00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,280
for zebra maybe i want to go in

00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,319
and sort of manually order those so i

00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,479
can say

00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:32,000
let's move the san diego zoo result to

00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:35,120
the top

00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:38,160
and save that

00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:41,600
and now if we go back to here

00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:45,440
and refresh our results now we can see

00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,440
the san diego zoo result is at the top

00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:50,080
now uh we excluded the muscle result

00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,400
from this particular search

00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:55,039
and if we search specifically for muscle

00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,880
we can see our zebra muscle there

00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:58,160
but if we actually change the query to

00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,960
the

00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,319
deeper muscle then we can see that it's

00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,479
actually showing our

00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:06,479
zebra promoted results and the reason

00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:08,479
for that is that by default

00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:10,720
uh search overrides does kind of a broad

00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:15,039
matching strategy so it'll say

00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:17,759
um if you're promoting results for

00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:19,360
zebra then any query that contains zebra

00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,440
i'm going to apply that to you

00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,280
and that may not work in all situations

00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:25,039
and so let's go ahead and change that

00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:27,360
in the configuration which is pretty

00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:29,360
simple so you just go here and say

00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,120
only match it if it matches the entire

00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,680
search string so basically turning off

00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,680
that include strategy

00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:38,160
and now if we go back to our search

00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,160
results

00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,840
you can see it's showing our zebra

00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,360
muscle as we would expect

00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:45,840
and just to validate that that hasn't

00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,400
broken what we had promoted for the

00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,160
zebra

00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:50,720
you can go back to zebra and see there

00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:52,160
san diego is still at the top

00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,000
one thing i'll mention before we hop out

00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,520
of the demo is that there's also another

00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,800
configuration you can do so

00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:01,199
again out of the box uh search overrides

00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:03,039
uh defaults to letting you promote nodes

00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:04,479
but if you have other types of content

00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:05,680
in your search index and you want the

00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:07,520
option to

00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,440
index those other kinds of content so it

00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,639
might be taxonomy terms maybe you're

00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:13,520
indexing users

00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:14,080
or even some kind of uh custom content

00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,199
entities

00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:18,639
um you switch it to this uh select from

00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:20,800
the search index and then tell it which

00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:22,560
index to use and then when you save it

00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,080
that autocomplete is actually doing a

00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,720
live query against your

00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:29,840
server instead of just doing sort of a

00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,840
title match for nodes

00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,680
so with that let's talk about a couple

00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:35,919
of things related to sort of best

00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:37,680
practices and using search overrides

00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:38,959
so first off typically you're going to

00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:41,039
want to use this sparingly

00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:42,080
if you do find that you're wanting to

00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:44,480
override

00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:46,240
most of the you know popular search

00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,600
queries on your site then it probably

00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,120
indicates that you actually really need

00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,560
to do some relevance tuning or maybe

00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,320
even look at setting up

00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,160
machine learning so that solar can

00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:57,120
essentially learn from

00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:59,839
the results that users are choosing and

00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:02,399
sort of organically promoting those

00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:03,120
as we mentioned by default it uses that

00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,800
include

00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,720
matching strategy for the queries and

00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,959
that may or may not

00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,640
suit some of the use cases that you have

00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:13,760
so good to test that

00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,800
and then also as we talked about um if

00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,640
you switch to

00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,399
to pulling content from the index as

00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:20,160
opposed to looking for notes

00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:22,080
um it gives you the opportunity to

00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:24,560
promote uh other kinds of content

00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,839
beyond just notes and then the last

00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,519
thing i'll mention is that it does

00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:32,000
require a version of

00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:34,399
4.7 uh for solar or newer so

00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,839
the the properties that the module uses

00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:36,800
are ones that were added to solar and

00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:38,480
4.7

00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,080
and so if you're using an older version

00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,839
of solar then it essentially

00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:44,000
you know won't successfully manipulate

00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:45,760
the results so i know acquia recently

00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,360
updated its solar and so you can use

00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:49,120
this module on aqia

00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,880
you can obviously use it on any of the

00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,560
hosting services where you have control

00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,200
over the version of solar so something

00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,959
like a

00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:58,959
platform sh aws google cloud

00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:01,519
the only holdout that i know of for

00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:03,760
drupal kind of major holdout is pantheon

00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:06,560
is still using an older version of

00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,920
solar but you could always use like a

00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,480
search stacks i think they're actually

00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,519
in the

00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,320
um exhibit hole or you could use like an

00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:14,399
open solar

00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,920
or another solar hosting service i feel

00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:19,200
like for most cases they're probably not

00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:20,560
going to be too expensive

00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,000
so the last thing i'm going to mention

00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,360
is a couple of things that are on the

00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,519
roadmap in terms of

00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,519
features that we might add into the

00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:29,839
search overrides modules so one is the

00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:32,959
idea of having role specific overrides

00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:35,279
so let's say within your content index

00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:37,279
is an employee handbook and you want to

00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:39,680
promote that as the top result

00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:40,399
for certain queries but maybe only for

00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:45,600
people who are

00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:45,600
authenticated as staff or you might say

00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,560
i have a product that's going to be

00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,320
launching on may 1st and there are

00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:52,320
specific queries where i want that

00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:54,000
product on day one to always be the top

00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,440
result and so potentially having the

00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,959
ability to schedule

00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:59,519
uh search overrides is something i've

00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:00,240
also considered and finally for that

00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:03,600
interface

00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:05,839
where you're actually um defining your

00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,440
search overrides and and being able to

00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:08,959
drag and drop the results

00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,959
i think it works well as it is but i

00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:12,399
feel like it might be more intuitive if

00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:13,760
instead of being a list where you have

00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:15,839
to sort of manually

00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:18,320
search out results if potentially as

00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:20,800
soon as you put in that keyword

00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:23,040
it provided you with kind of a live list

00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,560
of the top results as they are today

00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,240
and you can drag and drop some to

00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,320
reorder them

00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,399
potentially click to exclude others and

00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,399
and then maybe manually add to that

00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:34,000
but i feel like in terms of a management

00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:35,680
experience that might be uh

00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,399
might be a better way to go so hopefully

00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:40,000
hoping to get there in time

00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:42,079
so with that i'm going to turn it over

00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,399
to uh some discussion but if you wanted

00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:47,920
a copy of the slides you can just go to

00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:47,920
bitly search overrides

00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:53,120
all right and i'm going to look at the q

00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:55,040
a here

00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,800
is it possible how easy is to set up a

00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:59,120
search bar separate from your main site

00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:02,560
search

00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:03,600
um okay so um

00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,040
actually i should read the whole

00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,959
question for the sake of the recording

00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,440
so jack has asked is it possible how

00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:09,360
easy

00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,200
is it to set up search bar separate from

00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,720
your main site search

00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,639
if i wanted to set up a search bar to

00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,959
display on a view that just returns a

00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:19,519
specific content type

00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:20,160
so i'm not sure that's really applicable

00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:24,160
to

00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:26,000
um to this particular like module

00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,839
or its implementation but you can

00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,480
definitely set up let's say

00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:32,399
um either a view and have it

00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,720
pre-filtered based on the content type

00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:36,959
or you could potentially even set up a

00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,560
separate search index

00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:40,320
where potentially you could do you know

00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,360
more advanced things like offer other

00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,880
facets

00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:46,399
or um yeah have different ways of kind

00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:48,000
of filtering you might have

00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:49,600
conditional facets i mean there's a

00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,959
whole rabbit hole of different ways you

00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,680
could approach that

00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:55,200
um how does search override work on

00:12:53,680 --> 00:13:00,480
multi-sites websites

00:12:55,200 --> 00:13:00,480
um so it really depends on

00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,480
a couple of things i guess number one

00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:07,519
how you have the the

00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:10,160
search index setup so you can have

00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:13,279
your search index set up so that it will

00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:16,079
display results across all of the sites

00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:17,760
in which case if you're using it in the

00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:18,959
default mode where it's only showing

00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,560
nodes it's only

00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:22,160
going to show nodes on the site that

00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:27,120
you're working on um

00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:27,120
if you wanted the ability to um

00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:31,680
to have it show so suppose that you're

00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:33,519
you have your index um

00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:35,200
set up to show results across all of

00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:38,079
your sites within the index and you want

00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:41,040
to promote any of those

00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:42,959
then you would need to um to switch it

00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,959
over to the index mode in which case you

00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:46,160
should be able to promote results from

00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:49,760
the other

00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:53,120
sites but the thing to remember is that

00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:54,079
the um the search overrides entities

00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,000
that you create are

00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:58,240
are going to be site-specific they're

00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,240
part of that site's content technically

00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,680
and so promoting it in one site doesn't

00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,120
mean that it's going to be promoted in

00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,320
any of the other sites that are using

00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:07,199
that same index

00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,320
so maybe something to keep in mind there

00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:10,399
kyle asks does

00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:12,160
the search overrides module work with

00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:15,120
specific versions of solar

00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:16,480
um so yes as i mentioned before it will

00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:20,079
work with

00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:21,920
anything 4.7 or newer so um

00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:24,560
the solar 7 on aqueous search will

00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,560
definitely work

00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:32,320
all right i think we're at time um

00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,560
just going to look at the chat here i

00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:36,160
will mention again that um i go by

00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,760
mancru on twitter so
