00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:23,920
uh just some history in case you all

00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,680
did not know it began in 2016 when nikki

00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,960
stephens and karen castillo gave a

00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,680
presentation about diversity and

00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,000
inclusion

00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,800
at drupalcon new orleans after that

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,399
there was a buff

00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,559
and there was so much energy around the

00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,960
space that we've started up

00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:40,800
a whole initiative and it is a project

00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:42,000
that is available on drupal.org

00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,000
if you would like to learn more

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,800
information about us i'm going to post a

00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,320
link and i will also slow down a bit

00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,399
because i'm speaking very nervously and

00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,480
quickly

00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,160
but our current initiatives that we have

00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,480
going on at this time

00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,559
are drupal diversity and inclusion

00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:01,440
presentations we will go around

00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:02,640
and do presentations at different camps

00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,840
to speak on

00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,840
different issues of diversity inclusion

00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:11,360
and equity

00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:13,280
we also have a resource library we

00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,280
have a contrib team that's helping

00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:18,000
people you know go through the steps

00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,720
of doing contrib work uh for the drupal

00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,439
project

00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,400
we also have the ddi careers initiative

00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:24,799
session help

00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,000
and a speaker initiative so if there's a

00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:27,680
way that you want to contribute

00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,360
to drupal and you're a person that is

00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,680
underrepresented or

00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:33,600
that has been previously marginalized we

00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,479
are here to help you navigate

00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:38,320
uh those spaces in the ways that are

00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:39,680
unique to you

00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:42,000
some previous cool things that we've

00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:44,240
done is that we had

00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,520
done drupalcon nashville planning so we

00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:49,119
had a board game night

00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:51,200
pronoun stickers we organized buffs

00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:53,439
which are birds of a feather sessions at

00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,600
drupalcon baltimore nashville

00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:57,600
and we also ran a we are drupal photo

00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:00,079
booth i i think that was actually my

00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,759
first drupalcon in baltimore where i saw

00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:04,799
that and that's pretty neat

00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:07,119
um and

00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,720
we do organizer packets so that's a

00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:10,080
resource for organizers to help them

00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,760
organize and support diverse and

00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,520
inclusive events

00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,920

00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:37,120
some great one of the few differences uh

00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:37,519
one of the big differences that happened

00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,480
is

00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:42,799
um the community working group has split

00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,720
up into the conflict resolution and code

00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,720
of conduct enforcement team

00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,319
which i am part of and the community

00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,799

scattered about in here as well um

00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:58,879
we decided to split that up because as

00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,280
the conflict resolution and the code of

00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:03,040
conduct enforcement we weren't able to

00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,599

00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,319
and focus as much as we wanted to on

00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:08,879
things that are

00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:10,080
more proactive such as workshops that

00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:24,720
learn at the time

00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:26,160
fun very fun um so i started joining the

00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,240
irc sessions

00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,080
where there were indeed a bunch of

00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,280
really awesome very patient mentors who

00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,880
helped me get set up with local

00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,919
development who helped me understand the

00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,360
issue queue

00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:37,599
and who just introduced me to the

00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,199
community um

00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:41,919
so that's kind of what i've been doing

00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:44,000
with drupal since is

00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:45,199
that mentor role in helping others get

00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,560
started

00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:48,560
so at this point um

00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:52,479
core contribution mentoring sort of

00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:55,520
started by xjm

00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:56,160
back in 2012 and we had those office

00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,960
hours

00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,080
and it was so popular that it became

00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:03,759
sort of the core

00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:04,479
part of drupalcon and so every year we

00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:07,599
get together

00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:09,039
now on slack and do a lot of organizing

00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:11,840
put together booth slides and

00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:13,280
contribution workshops and

00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:15,759
whatever else may need to be done for

00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:18,160
the event and in the last year

00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:19,919
that's transitioned obviously to virtual

00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,400
and i have to give a lot of props to amy

00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:23,840
june

00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:27,360
and chris dark for just tons of work

00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:31,199
making that workshop fantastic and

00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,199
in little video segments um

00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:35,599
a lot of work and i'm very very grateful

00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,839
because i'm not a video editor

00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:42,080
or whatever so teamwork

00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:44,000
fantastic um let's see what else did i

00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,360
want to say i had notes

00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,600
right so at this point we are looking

00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:50,800
for mentors for next week

00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:52,640
and we need all sorts of folks

00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,959
rachel you are a great um little

00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:57,040
cheering section back there thank you

00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:58,240
um we need all sorts of folks so not

00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,959
just people who

00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:02,720
know how to code but we also need

00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:04,000
marketers we need project managers we

00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,560
need

00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,200
designers and just whatever your skill

00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,120
set is

00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:12,560
there is definitely a way that you can

00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,560
help as a mentor

00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,720
so i'm hoping that everybody has had a

00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,880
chance to look at the schedule for next

00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:21,360
week it is oriented more around

00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:22,320
initiatives than usual so there's a day

00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,160
for each initiative

00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,399
and on each initiative day there will be

00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:28,480
a contribution time in the afternoon

00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:30,480
um and we're hoping to have a few

00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:35,279
mentors for each of those

00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:35,279
initiatives in the afternoon

00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:43,760
let um drop you some links so we've got

00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,760
uh the slack space

00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:49,600
on drupal slack is

00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,200
pound mentoring and if you pop into

00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,959
there i'm going to

00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:55,600
leave these links available for

00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:57,519
everybody i'll pin them to the channel

00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,800
but the first thing that a mentor would

00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:02,560
need to do

00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:07,600
is to sign up to open social

00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:07,600
that's going to be here

00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:12,800
drupalcontributions.opensocial.site

00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:14,240
um so we'll all be doing contributions

00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,360
in that space and if you sign up there

00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,279
create an account

00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,399
then you can join different groups which

00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:21,360
is basically a table

00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:22,800
if you're familiar with in-person

00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:26,160
operations

00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:28,000
um yes

00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,839
and we'll have a mentor orientation

00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,120
event or

00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:35,279
mentors later in the week on friday

00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,240
and yeah i think i should probably stop

00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:37,360
talking at this point i feel like i'm

00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,120
rambling a little bit so

00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,399

rocking it out so what we've been

00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:14,959
working on

00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:17,839
um since since basically

00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:19,680
or september i'm sorry september of 20.

00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:20,079
we all decide look we got to get to work

00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,920
now

00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:24,240
let's come up with let's focus on some

00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:27,839
things that this working group

00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:30,880
um can can really work on in 2021

00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:31,680
going into 2022 and we kind of narrowed

00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:35,120
it down to these

00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:38,240
three uh different different initiatives

00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:39,440
um the first one is uh onboarding at

00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,040
community events

00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,480
you know i'm really noticing this we're

00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,600
all kind of noticing this change right

00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,760
like of

00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,120
we're all getting older every day i'm

00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:49,920
starting to see those

00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:51,519
drupal.org profile names get real long

00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:54,880
in the tooth i think i've seen some

00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:58,320
18s and 19s probably even here

00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:59,519
um so onboarding at at drupal events is

00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:02,160
really important

00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:03,199
and what this initiative um their

00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:07,040
purpose is kind of

00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:09,519
grow to kind of provide a consistent

00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,399
um welcome and inclusive message for all

00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:12,000
drupal camps

00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:14,000
we're envisioning a slide deck that we

00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,120
can that drupal camps can download or

00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,120
drupal events

00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,240
um getting started with drupal type of

00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,839
things so that we

00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,519
have like this kind of consistent

00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:22,800
message um

00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:24,839
so you know they want to build a light

00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,000
curriculum maybe set up a network of

00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:28,160
trainers

00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,079
um and then you really want to pilot

00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:32,480
this this curriculum at um

00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:34,320
you know three events this year and

00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,360
actually one has already happened at mid

00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,040
camp so we're

00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,639
we're already on our way to piloting

00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,320
three

00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:42,720
the second initiative is the drupal

00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:45,920
events platform formerly known as the

00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:46,880
drupal event starter kit um the idea

00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,800
here is you know

00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:50,240
if you plan these events you know how

00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:52,399
laborious the website is

00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,600
um especially when you're talking about

00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:56,399
collecting tallest

00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,959
proposals putting the schedule together

00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:59,519
um

00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:01,839
we used to use this thing called cod

00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:03,759
i'll just do that real quick but

00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:06,240
um we're looking to kind of build

00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:09,920
something new that's very flexible

00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:13,199
looking to have kind of an mvp of of

00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:16,639
features that 80 of the drupal community

00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:17,279
could use um let's see we want to kind

00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,959
of

00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:20,800
like our goal of ours would be to

00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:22,639
maintain adoption by at least 40

00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:24,480
of our drupal events i mean if we can

00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:25,680
get a lot of people participating and

00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,320
helping out with this

00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:30,160
it can really cut down the work that it

00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,800
takes to kind of put these uh websites

00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,519
together

00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,920
so that's initiative too and initiative

00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:37,040
three

00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:40,399
last but not least is the drupal events

00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:43,279
database um the purpose of this

00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:43,759
uh database is to make sure that all of

00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:45,759
the

00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:47,279
events are all in one place we have

00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:49,759
duplicates lovely

00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:51,120
it looks beautiful and this actually

00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:53,120
this database is actually

00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,880
feeding into drupal count so we're

00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:57,600
trying to move a little away from

00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:59,360
you know the groups.drupal.org posting

00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:02,320
each event there and kind of having a

00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:03,199
main mean mean space for this um some of

00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:06,959
the goals

00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:09,199
for this initiative um are to kind of

00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:10,319
let's see we got highlight some of the

00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:11,679
events maybe um

00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:14,160
i don't want to ruin that one that's a

00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:15,120
surprise um propose some of the layout

00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:18,000
changes maybe

00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:19,439
um of the home page communicate the

00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,360
information about new events

00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:25,679
on on drupal.org and

00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:27,199
other sections as well so those are our

00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:29,280
three kind of major initiatives that

00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:31,200
we're kind of moving forward with

00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:32,799
we're looking for volunteers participate

00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:35,760
on all of these initiatives

00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:39,039
we have initiative leads and we'll send

00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:39,039
send out the link in the notes

00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:45,440
so what can you do to get involved

00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:47,440
get your event featured on drupal.org we

00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,360
can't stress this or not next week

00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,559
um at drupalcon it's going to be

00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,640
something cool

00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:54,880
we need as many events on here as

00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:57,280
possible so do you run a meetup

00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,400
yes i do go ahead and put it on do you

00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:01,120
run a duplicant

00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,000
we say go ahead and put it on so go to

00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:04,880
this website

00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,520
drupal.org community events and start

00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:09,440
adding

00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:09,440
your events on to the website

00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:13,120
how can you get involved is multiple

00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,240
ways again you don't have to be an

00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:16,000
organizer

00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:18,000
specifically you could be a part of an

00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:21,679
organizing team you could be interested

00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,320
in doing events go to the drupal.org

00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:25,039
community

00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:26,880
event organizers that's our page we have

00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:28,799
a monthly zoom call

00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,400
every month when you can see us like

00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:31,600
this i love seeing all the people's

00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:35,039
faces

00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:35,840
we also have the event organizers slack

00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:38,640
which is

00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:40,000
a slack group outside of the big drupal

00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:42,160
community slack

00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,039
and we also have our email newsletter

00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:46,240
and you can get

00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:49,679
involved in the issue queue i

00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:52,880
think i got it done in seven minutes

00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:55,600
so um i believe

00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,799
in the chat i didn't mean to chat i'm

00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,799
not gonna say

00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:59,840
i didn't mean to send my chat earlier i

00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:02,640
thought i could hit

00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:03,919
shift and enter and it wouldn't enter

00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:06,320
but it did so here you go here are all

00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:09,600
the links

00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:12,000
so thank you all appreciate it thanks

00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:13,360
and again in the q q a if you have more

00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,799
questions for colleen

00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,400
we're going to be breaking out in there

00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:17,919
soon but thanks for the overview that

00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:21,120
was outstanding

00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:22,960
thanks for all the links next up

00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:25,600
i just want to check in with carly

00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:28,799
because we have a message from

00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:30,880
uh jennifer hodgston from the about the

00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:33,520
contributor guide

00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:34,640
so with that we're going to be playing a

00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:36,000
video

00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,960
and there's going to be some audio in

00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:43,760
there we could probably post a video

00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:45,679
to um in the chat as well amy june

00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:47,760
again i'm just trying to figure this out

00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:50,080
so if you're unable to watch it like

00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:51,679
everybody else here and get the audio

00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:54,559
which is what we're gonna do our best at

00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:57,039
to hear jennifer's message about the

00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:57,919
contributor guide uh there's other ways

00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:01,120
to watch it

00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:05,120
later with that

00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:08,720
i'll pause and see if carly wants to

00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:11,280
take it away can everybody see my screen

00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,280
just fine

00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,240
i see a bunch of headphones no

00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:20,400
okay it says has started screen sharing

00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,880
so

00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:26,080
it's all black it says double click to

00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,080
enter full screen mode

00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:35,840
all right maybe choose switch screen

00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:35,840
let me try again

00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:47,280
any luck there can everyone see it now

00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:50,320
uh same thing maybe try and

00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:52,520
play it and let's see

00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:55,520
hi my name is jennifer hodgdon i'm j

00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:55,520
hodgson.org

00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:01,120
you can hear it but you can't see it

00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:04,400
correct

00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:07,440
okay well let's um if we want to

00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:10,080
let me try to swap over um

00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,280
when we tested it it worked just fine so

00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:13,840
let's

00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:17,600
maybe we can move on to discover drupal

00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:20,720
and then i will work on

00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:23,200
trying to figure out why this video is

00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:25,360
being challenging great plan uh you can

00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:29,039
probably just stop technology

00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:29,039
permissions darn you

00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:34,799
a live demos i had a

00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,280
quick question is this working i tried

00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:37,600
to share

00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:38,720
my screen yeah it is actually that is

00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,960
working yeah oh

00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:42,480
okay let me make sure i'm piping in

00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:45,840
sound

00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,840
share sound

00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:51,280
okay i'm gonna try oh an error occurred

00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:01,200
well

00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:03,120
hi my name is jennifer hodgdon i'm j

00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,480
hodgdon on drupal.org and i'm sorry i

00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:06,000
couldn't be here in person but i've

00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:09,200
recorded a video for you about the

00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,799
contributor guide initiative

00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,480
the objectives of our initiative were to

00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:13,440
create a new contributor guide on

00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,120
drupal.org

00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:17,200
that would enable new and experienced

00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,400
contributors to find roles and tasks

00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,320
where they could use their skills to

00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:22,080
contribute to various areas and aspects

00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:24,240
of the drupal project

00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:26,080
a secondary objective was to reorganize

00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,280
the content that was formerly in the old

00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:29,200
getting involved guide

00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:31,120
to reduce duplication and improve its

00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:33,760
organization and navigation

00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:34,320
and we had we had content that would

00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:36,400
help

00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:38,000
contributors find tasks and roles to do

00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:41,840
but it was uh pretty scattered and

00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,840
pretty hard to find

00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,679
the leaders of this initiative are

00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:48,240
myself jay hodgdon and rachel lawson

00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:49,600
who's rachel norfolk on drupal.org

00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,120
and i would like to just acknowledge

00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:54,400
that we had help from many others in the

00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:58,240
community who came to meetings reviewed

00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:59,679
the structure reviewed content created

00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,679
content and many other

00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:03,120
tasks so i just appreciate everybody

00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:04,559
that pitched in to help and there's

00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:08,080
still room to help which i'll be getting

00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:09,360
to in a little bit

00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:11,120
i want to talk a little bit about the

00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:12,960
structure of the contributor guide we

00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:14,159
actually created three new content types

00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:16,559
on drupal.org

00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:18,320
one called contributor task for a task

00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:20,640
that a contributor might do

00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:21,360
one called contributor role for a longer

00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,799
term role

00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,960
that somebody in the community could

00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:26,240
fill and one called contributor skill

00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:28,400
that describes the skill

00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,840
and how to achieve it and the skills are

00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:33,120
used to

00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:35,360
do tasks and fill roles

00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:36,480
we also created a number of contribution

00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:39,120
area pages

00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:41,039
um that was not a new content type and

00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:42,720
then we have entity references and views

00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:44,720
to link them together the contribution

00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:47,919
areas are also a taxonomy which allowed

00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:51,279
us to do entity references between the

00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:54,159
tasks and areas roles and areas and then

00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:55,679
the tasks are linked to skills the roles

00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:57,039
are linked to skills and the tasks can

00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:57,840
be linked to roles and then we have

00:23:57,039 --> 00:24:01,440
views to link

00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:01,440
all of those references together

00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:06,559
i want to talk briefly about the status

00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:09,760
of this initiative

00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:11,600
the um contributor guide is basically up

00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,480
on drupal.org you can find it by going

00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,559
to community

00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:16,080
and then clicking on contributor guide

00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:19,120
in that menu

00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:21,360
there are a lot of good

00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:22,960
there's a lot of good task content um we

00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:24,799
could probably use more but we have

00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:26,320
quite a few tasks that are good for

00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:28,880
people with various different types of

00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:31,200
skills we have some role content we

00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:32,960
probably need more of that

00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,880
the skill pages we have a lot of

00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,919
placeholder pages for skills and some of

00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,840
them have been written

00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:41,200
many of them still need content or

00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:42,880
editing and the contribution area pages

00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,480
again we have placeholder pages for a

00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:46,559
lot of areas they um

00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:48,640
many of the pages need more content and

00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:49,360
also many of them need roles to be

00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,919
written up

00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:53,360
for the roles that are related to those

00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:55,039
contribution areas

00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:56,880
and then the design as you can tell from

00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:58,880
this presentation design and graphics

00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:01,679
are not my strong point

00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:04,799
and also probably the contributor guide

00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:04,799
could use more graphics

00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:09,440
all right i'd like to give you a brief

00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:11,200
demo of the contributor guide just to

00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:13,039
show you what's there again if you go to

00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,000
community and then find contributor

00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:15,840
guide in the menu

00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,840
the top menu on drupal.org that's how

00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:19,919
you can get to the contributor guide

00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:21,520
um so this is just the landing page for

00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:23,600
the contributor guide from here

00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:26,000
you can click on browse by task browse

00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,480
by role browse by skill or browse by

00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,240
area

00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:30,480
and also in the sidebar you can find

00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:33,919
these pages

00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:36,240
the role page is a view where you can

00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:37,120
filter by contribution area filter by

00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,720
title keyword

00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:41,360
and find the various roles that are

00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:45,120
available the

00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:46,880
task page is also a view

00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:48,159
again you can filter by contribution

00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,080
area and then

00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:51,440
there are different types of tasks that

00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:53,600
you can also filter for and you can

00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:56,000
filter by title keyword

00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:57,440
um i just want to show you briefly the

00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,600
structure of a task

00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:01,760
all tasks have a goal they link to the

00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:03,360
skills that are required for that goal

00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,480
some background information which you

00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,919
could read if you didn't have the

00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:09,360
background information

00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:11,039
and then detailed steps on how to

00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:13,200
do the task and these should be

00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:15,520
standalone so that anybody

00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,559
um who's not familiar with contributing

00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:19,360
could

00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:19,360
go ahead and

00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:25,520
use the find a task page and find a task

00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:28,720
and go ahead and do it

00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:30,720
the skills browser is another view

00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:32,240
again you can this one just has a filter

00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:34,880
by title keyword

00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:36,640
and uh the structure of a skill page

00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:38,640
i've got one open here

00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:41,120
is that it has a little description at

00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:42,880
the top some links to resources to how

00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:46,159
to improve or

00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:47,200
gain that skill and then some a view

00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:49,039
down at the bottom that

00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:51,200
shows you roles and tasks that might use

00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:53,120
that skill

00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:54,799
the contribution areas landing page is

00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,279
not very exciting just a list of the

00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:57,520
areas

00:26:55,279 --> 00:27:00,400
let me just show you briefly one area

00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:03,919
page this is contribute to documentation

00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:05,520
area um you have a big body that gives

00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:07,200
you some information about contributing

00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:09,679
to documentation and then a view that

00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:13,919
shows you tasks and roles and also

00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:13,919
skills that could be used in that area

00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,520
i'd just like to conclude this brief

00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:19,440
video by

00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:20,960
explaining how you could help to improve

00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,480
the contributor guide

00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:24,240
first thing that you could do is you

00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:27,200
could edit or write

00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:28,880
skill pages so we have a temporary task

00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:30,720
write up for that if you go to the find

00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,760
a task page and filter to task type

00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:33,919
temporary or

00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:34,880
also you could filter to keyword skill

00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:36,640
in the title

00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:38,799
you can find that write up about how to

00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:41,200
do that

00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:42,000
second thing that you could do is just

00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:44,080
try out

00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,360
a task that interests you and see if the

00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:47,200
steps are clear and they work

00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:48,960
if not you could edit the task or you

00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:50,960
could use the sidebar link that's on any

00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:52,559
task page to create an issue

00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:54,720
if you have any other suggestions for

00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:56,960
the contributor guide

00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:59,200
please create an issue there's a link on

00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:02,559
every contributor guide

00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:06,720
page to create an issue in the community

00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:09,200
section project and

00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:10,399
that will bring it to the attention of

00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,159
me and rachel

00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:13,919

the community

00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:30,000
community pulls together to play the

00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:34,000
video uh thanks so much

for

00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:41,200
uh uh the contributor guide you got a

00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:43,360
good overview there's a video

00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:44,480
and please connect with jennifer

00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,810

00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:47,919
about that

00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:52,000
[Music]

00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:55,120
so thanks so much we're going to move on

00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:57,039
to the discover drupal initiative

00:28:55,120 --> 00:29:00,080
i believe allison manley is going to be

00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:03,440
talking about that initiative

00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:06,480
yep hi everybody um i'm allison

00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:08,320
and discover drupal is the drupal

00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:11,120
association's new initiative

00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:11,760
to try to unlock opportunities for those

00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:14,399
who have been

00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,960
upper underrepresented in the open

00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:18,080
source

00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:19,120
community we all know that entering and

00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:21,120
navigating

00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:22,880
open source can be confusing and

00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:24,480
frustrating particularly

00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:26,559
for people who don't see themselves in

00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:28,159
the community already

00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:30,399
and of course we also all know that

00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:32,640
drupal and open source by nature

00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:34,320
has no clear pathway to actually get

00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:36,880
there we've all come here from

00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:38,960
different avenues there's there's no

00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:41,200
school or specific journey

00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:43,200
that one takes to become an employable

00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:44,399
drupal person

00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,480
and you also have to know how to

00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:49,440
contribute and you have to have the time

00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:51,600
and frankly the privilege to do all that

00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,480
so since there is no one way to approach

00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:55,360
drupal

00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:58,480
this program discover drupal is designed

00:29:55,360 --> 00:30:00,960
to provide a pathway and bridge that gap

00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:01,520
so what this initiative does is provides

00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:05,600
training

00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:07,279
and scholarships for um

00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:09,120
and mentoring from drupal community

00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:11,520
members and connections

00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:13,200
also at the end of the training to

00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:14,960
potential employers helping those

00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:18,240
students build their skills and launch

00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:20,080
some career in open source so

00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:21,760
three existing training organizations

00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,720
have collaborated with the drupal

00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:24,799
association

00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:26,320
to help with the design and the

00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:28,000
implementation of this

00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:29,520
the drupal association is acting as the

00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,919
backbone for the program

00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:33,600
so as for right now it's media current

00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:35,679
drupal easy and evolving web

00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:37,200
that are working on the training and

00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:38,080
they've helped think through the program

00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,000
design

00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:43,360
and have provided an incredible amount

00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:45,440
of insight and support to date

00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:46,399
eventually right now it is limited to

00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:48,559
north america

00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:50,720
just for size and scope and trying to

00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:52,399
get the pilot program off the ground we

00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:55,039
are hoping to expand this

00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:56,880
more globally currently the program is

00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:57,679
going to be open to individuals who are

00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:00,399
over 18

00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:02,640
and identify as a racial minority we do

00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:04,640
recognize that marginalization exists

00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:06,799
for many identities which all need to be

00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:08,080
addressed in knowledge

00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:10,080
but since racial identity

00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:11,039
marginalization exists in

00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,880
all the other aspects of

00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:14,480
intersectionality and is the largest

00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,760
disparity right now that exists in

00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:17,679
drupal and open source

00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:18,960
this program is just a starting point to

00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:21,360
help address that

00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:22,960
and we hope that it will expand a lot

00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:25,519
more over time

00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:28,000
we could have at the at this point as

00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:30,720
many as 10 students but we will likely

00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,600
also possibly be starting smaller since

00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,960
this is the

00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,919
pilot program and we want to make sure

00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,760
that we get it right and it's

00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:38,240
sustainable for the long term

00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:40,320
it will take a prob approximately a year

00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:42,159
um the students will select from one of

00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:43,919
three learning pathways either

00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:45,840
front-end developer back-end developer

00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:46,799
or site builder they'll be matched with

00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:48,240
mentors

00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:50,480
they are given supplemental learning

00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:54,559
tools and a refurbished laptop so if you

00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:58,080
have laptops to donate we will take them

00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:59,200
they will complete a final project and

00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,559
after they go through the training

00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,760
they'll work on a project and then

00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:04,000
hopefully we'll all

00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:05,279
be joining us in person at the next

00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,840
drupal con

00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:09,600
for free so that's where money donations

00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:11,360
come in handy if you'd like to donate

00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:13,120
money we could use those for flights

00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:14,000
because we hope to all be in person next

00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:17,440
year

00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,960
um and then there at the next drupal con

00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:22,000
in 2022

00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:23,840
we will amplify uh their journey

00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,840
help build their network introduce them

00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:28,240
to other internship and entry-level

00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:29,840
employment opportunities um

00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:31,600

i believe we have suzanne durgacheva to

because promote drupal is all about

00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:47,039
making more more slides

00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:50,000
so um just a quick

00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:50,399
overview of the promo drupal initiative

00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,120
um

00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:55,039
basically where marketers writers

00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:57,519
translators

00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:58,880
agency leaders developers uh spreading

00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:00,000
the word about drupal and trying to

00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:02,240
expand

00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,360
um and get the word out outside the

00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:06,640
community about

00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:09,119
drupal um and

00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:10,879
really it's a marketing initiative um

00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:13,919
for those of you who don't know there's

00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:16,960
actually already um a basis of

00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:19,040
you know a brand for drupal um a video

00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:20,000
a pitch deck so there are some materials

00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:22,159
that have

00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,839
already been developed as part of this

00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:26,720
initiative

00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:27,359
and we have some ongoing kind of

00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:30,560
projects

00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:32,879
that we are slowly making progress on

00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:34,159
um there's a project to create better

00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:36,320
content for

00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:37,960
drupal evaluators so those are more like

00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:39,119
the decision makers who come to

00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:42,480
drupal.org

00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:43,839
or are looking for their first taste of

00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:47,200
drupal and trying to figure out if it's

00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:50,320
a good fit for their project

00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:54,000
and we did a survey in the last

00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:58,000
six months of evaluators and found that

00:34:54,000 --> 00:35:01,119
they were really looking for more um

00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:03,680
more information in that process more

00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:04,640
case studies more demo sites and kind of

00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:07,119
more

00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:07,920
um helpful material about certain pain

00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:11,920
points in the

00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:13,280
in the process of um of using drupal so

00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:15,520
they might have heard

00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:16,960
that drupal's hard to upgrade right and

00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:19,920
so they they

00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:22,240
are looking for maybe some material to

00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:25,359
help convince them otherwise

00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:28,720
um and so one of the things that

00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:31,599
um we are working on is some more

00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:33,280
evergreen material just to promote

00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:36,560
drupal to those people

00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:37,839
um so for example there was a one-pager

00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:40,160
that was created

00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:41,760
when drupal 9 launched so converting

00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:43,599
that into

00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:46,079
more of an evergreen marketing material

00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:49,200
that can be used

00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:50,000
for evaluators there's also a wealth of

00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:54,160
other

00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:56,000
material around drupal marketing that

00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:58,079
that's been created

00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,520
that needs some love um and probably

00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:01,520
needs to be showcased better on

00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:05,440
drupal.org and kind of

00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:07,440
better integrated um and perhaps updated

00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:08,800
all it's very common for this type of

00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:12,079
thing to go out of date

00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:13,839
so we have um we have that as an

00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:16,560
outstanding task as well

00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:17,520
um also i know colleen mentioned

00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:19,040
onboarding

00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:20,960
uh this onboarding program that the

00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:24,839
event organizer working group has

00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:26,320
worked on um and so the promote drupal

00:36:24,839 --> 00:36:27,839
initiative

00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:29,839
has helped out a little bit with

00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:33,280
creating some personas

00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:35,440
of people who want to get into drupal

00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:37,839
um so these personas are more around the

00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:41,040
technologists not the evaluators

00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:42,720
so those have been created and this what

00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:46,160
is drupal style pitch deck

00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:48,880
has been created kind of as a as a

00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:50,160
as a piece of content more targeted to

00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:52,400
that audience

00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:54,160
um obviously would be great to have

00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:57,359
these personas as well for the

00:36:54,160 --> 00:37:00,640
evaluators um and then i

00:36:57,359 --> 00:37:02,160
also just do a quick shout out to this

00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:04,160
drupalcon marketing and outreach

00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:06,960
committee that's been hard at work

00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:08,400
um working with the drupal association

00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:11,440
really closely with

00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:13,839
um carly and and her team and just

00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:15,680
getting the word out about drupalcon and

00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:16,720
there's been like a lot of social media

00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:19,520
work being done

00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:20,240
um email campaigns and and that kind of

00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:22,480
thing and

00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:25,040
it's just great to see the community

00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:28,880
coming together and working on this

00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:31,359
um so there's other um

00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:32,960
kind of opportunities to get there's a

00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:34,400
lot of opportunity to get involved and

00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:36,960
promote drupal right now

00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:38,079
we've actually taken some time to define

00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:41,359
what the opera

00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:42,240
volunteer opportunities are and there's

00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:46,079
a forum

00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:47,440
to get involved so if you have um

00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:49,119
i mean if you want to get involved or if

00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:50,480
there's somebody on your team who is

00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:53,200
looking for a way to

00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:54,560
contribute to drupal in a non

00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:57,359
non-technical role no

00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:58,640
