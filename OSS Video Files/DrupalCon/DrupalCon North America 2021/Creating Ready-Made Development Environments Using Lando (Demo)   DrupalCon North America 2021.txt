hey everyone welcome

00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,800
if everyone can uh hear me okay could

00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:20,160
someone

00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,960
let me know in the chat all right i see

00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,920
some so i'm

00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,800
thinking that's a yes thank you all so

00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,320
much

00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,160
we're just gonna get started in just a

00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:31,840
minute we're gonna get started on time

00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,840
since we have limited time

00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:47,120
all right i think uh this is our start

00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,680
time

00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,239
105 eastern so we'll go ahead and get

00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,440
started

00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:55,760
and today we're going to talk about

00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,960
creating ready-made development

00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,840
environments using

00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,840
lando

00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:08,960
not that lando this lando

00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:10,240
so first very quickly who am i my name

00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:13,119
is mark dorsen i

00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:15,360
am a partner and the chief technology

00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:18,320
officer at chromatic where we are on a

00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:20,560
mission to rid the world of bad websites

00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:23,439
uh i don't know if we're gonna have time

00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,880
for many questions if any at the end

00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:27,600
but if you do have follow-up questions

00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:31,040
you can find me on twitter at markdorson

00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,840
chromatic hq is chromatic so happy to

00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,600
chat

00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:38,799
there as well so let's get right into it

00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:40,479
um who what where when why how are

00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:42,399
always the most important questions but

00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:43,439
we don't even have time for this entire

00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:46,560
set today

00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:49,040
so we're going to cut a couple

00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,079
we're going to go with who what why and

00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:54,479
how

00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:56,960
who and where are easy let's knock these

00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,960
out first

00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:04,320
who it's you

00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:05,759
you're here we're talking lando this is

00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,600
all you

00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,360
the what the what who and the what are

00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,800
easy

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,200
we're creating development environments

00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:16,000
so what do we even mean by that

00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:18,319
so an environment to do web development

00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,560
on your local machine

00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:24,480
and ideally if you're working on a team

00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,640
you would like these to be the same

00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,400
across everyone's different environments

00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:37,120
you want people to have the same

00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:41,200
setups but why do we like that

00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:43,120
infrastructure is complicated um

00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,400
packages are complicated to keep up to

00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,920
date um

00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,239
on different infrastructure i'm sure

00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:50,160
many of you have experienced situations

00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:52,800
where

00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,760
you have a version whether it be php

00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:58,959
apache

00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:58,959
nginx any of numerous other

00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,200
numerous other infrastructure pieces

00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,680
keeping those versions in sync across

00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:09,280
your development environment your team's

00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,440
development environment production

00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,200
any other environments can be quite

00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,640
complicated especially if anyone's

00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,800
managing that manually

00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:19,200
or if there's not some kind of shared

00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,800
set of state

00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,239
teams are also more specialized than

00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,280
they used to be so

00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:25,920
we're talking about development

00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,720
environments here but this can be a pain

00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,879
for

00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,799
developers who don't do a lot of devops

00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:33,680
work so

00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:35,680
many of you maybe have experience in

00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,799
setting these things up locally i know i

00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,560
have in the past where

00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,959
yeah no problem i'll set up apache on my

00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,879
local machine i'll shut up php

00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:45,760
um but as our teams become more

00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:48,239
specialized it's common that there are

00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,280
more people who they're experts in the

00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:51,200
jobs that they do

00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,120
but the jobs that they do are not

00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,760
setting up these services

00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,599
um so we want to make that easy for them

00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:59,680
or at least easier

00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:01,519
and the other piece is that when a two a

00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,280
new team member joins

00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:04,640
you know joins your project you want

00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,000
them to be up and running as quickly as

00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:09,280
possible

00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,360
time is money whether it's um

00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:14,400
your money whether it's your clients

00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:16,560
money whether it's your employer's money

00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,160
simplifying local development devops so

00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,320
you can focus on delivering

00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,799
value to your clients is going to be an

00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,799
improvement

00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,400
if you have a new team member joining

00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,360
and they spend three hours setting up

00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,800
their

00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,720
development environment to work on one

00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,000
ticket that only take that only takes

00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:35,040
them an hour that's

00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,440
not ideal so we're moving quickly but

00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,639
how are we going to do this this

00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,560
is the most important that's why you're

00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:43,680
here nope

00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:46,960
it's this it's this this lando

00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,280
so these are just some of the services

00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,800
that

00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:51,040
are available out of the box with

00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:54,880
lando's we've got php mariadb

00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:57,520
mysql um a whole host of others

00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:59,040
uh apache redis solar you probably use

00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,400
some combination of these we're at

00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,840
drupalcon so some

00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,560
combination of these on your drupal

00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:06,000
sites but it can do a lot more as well

00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:09,039
it's not just

00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,039
for drupal projects

00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:14,639
so one of the biggest solutions that

00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,880
lando brings to the table

00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:18,720
um and there are other options out there

00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,800
but um

00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,160
when i mentioned earlier about keeping

00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:25,199
versions in sync

00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,639
so if you upgrade php in production or

00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,479
in your development environments how do

00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:30,880
you keep that in sync

00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:32,880
between production qa environments

00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:35,199
development environments

00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,400
with lando which we're going to see we

00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:40,240
can make those changes

00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:43,120
php to 73 to 74 or different versions

00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,080
in one line change uh sometimes these

00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,479
are no big deal

00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:48,160
but you know they can become a nightmare

00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:49,919
if you are troubleshooting something and

00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,240
you're on different versions of

00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:53,759
in this example php but really any of

00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,720
the services that were on that

00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:58,240
previous slide and we're going to be

00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:01,120
able to check out the code

00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,520
and start without configuring anything

00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,639
uh

00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:09,600
locally besides installing lando

00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:09,600
so are we going to do a live demo

00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:14,479
no we are not going to do a live demo

00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:20,319
so this is an example of a lando config

00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,919
and if you can't read this don't worry

00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:24,080
this is a lot you're not supposed to be

00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:27,360
able to read this but so let's zoom in

00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,360
and start with the basics

00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:32,639
so this is better but we can go even

00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:35,919
further

00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:37,120
okay this seems doable here's an example

00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:40,160
of a basic

00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:43,280
lando configuration um

00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,319
you can see a project name you can see a

00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,400
recipe title

00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:48,160
in this case drupal 9 and then some

00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,479
configuration which is setting

00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:53,039
some values overriding what's the

00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:53,759
default in the recipe so here we see php

00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:57,440
is set to seven

00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:59,520
four webroot where our

00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,560
uh in this case drupal is installed in

00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:03,360
our document in our

00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:05,199
repository in the slash web directory

00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,560
we've got x debug turned off

00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:08,639
and in this case we're serving from

00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,960
nginx instead of

00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:12,400
the default apache for one of the

00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,160
reasons that i mentioned we want to

00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,120
match production we want to be testing

00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,520
in the similar

00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,160
and developing in a similar environment

00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:22,160
than

00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:24,479
what uh to what we have in production so

00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:28,000
in this case production is on nginx so

00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:28,000
we want to be in on nginx here

00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,680
and here you know you can see an example

00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,919
this is a diff uh

00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,680
displayed of when we upgraded from php

00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:36,240
to seven three to seven four it took one

00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:40,080
line

00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:42,720
um we didn't have to run any commands

00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,520
on a server somewhere we didn't need to

00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,120
uh

00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:47,280
with this you don't need to make sure

00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,599
that all of the developers on your team

00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,560
have upgraded chasing after them making

00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:52,000
sure

00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,680
you make this change you commit it to

00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,520
your repository and then when that's

00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:58,560
merged and they check that

00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:00,879
uh check it out the next time they start

00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:04,319
lando they're going to be on php 74

00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:06,479
as well so

00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:08,400
now we're zooming back out a bit and you

00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:10,160
can see what the section at the top

00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,680
lines one through eight is what we were

00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:14,720
just looking at but now we see some

00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:17,360
additional configuration we see

00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:19,199
some overrides for the services some

00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,120
some additional new services that aren't

00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:24,840
included by default so here we have

00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:26,000
a database we've set mariadb and version

00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:28,000
10.4

00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,680
we see redis redis configured for

00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
caching

00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,599
and we see elasticsearch configured for

00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
search

00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:37,519
and you can imagine if you look at lines

00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,959
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:42,159
for mariadb lines 15 for redis or 20 for

00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:44,399
elastic search

00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:45,440
all of those the example for the php

00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:47,680
version change

00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,560
we can accomplish the same thing on

00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,920
those lines

00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:54,480
updating versions changing uh

00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,519
changing even what type of service if

00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:59,839
we're changing from

00:08:55,519 --> 00:09:01,920
let's say mariadb to mysql itself

00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:03,600
so there's a lot of power in a very

00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:06,399
small amount of code and when this is

00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:08,560
committed to your repository

00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:10,160
when you're un let's use the example of

00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:12,399
a new developer checking out this

00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:14,160
project for the first time

00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:17,040
they don't really need to know anything

00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:18,240
about what the requirements are to get

00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:21,120
set up

00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:23,839
they check this out and they run plando

00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,839
start

00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,800
that's it this will start up and then

00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:31,040
once they do that

00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,560
this additional step they're going to

00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,760
have a working site now this applies

00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,760
because we're talking about a drupal

00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,760
site and

00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:40,080
a drupal site is very dependent on its

00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:42,000
database but you could imagine for other

00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:45,200
types of applications that

00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
um that are not a cms or not database

00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,839
dependent

00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,120
you just you know land a start and

00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:51,600
you're ready to go

00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:53,519
and you're gonna see this um this is

00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,399
this is what you're gonna see when lando

00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,240
starts up

00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:57,600
you're gonna see some output everything

00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:00,160
is green here so that means

00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:02,000
it was successful uh you're gonna see

00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:05,120
your project name

00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,120
where the you know the um your local

00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:09,440
path that it's checked out

00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:11,680
the services that you have configured

00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:14,000
and then the urls that lando has created

00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:16,000
for you to access the site so you plug

00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,360
that you one of those urls into your

00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,800
browser

00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,640
and you're off to the races you've

00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:25,200
started lando

00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:25,200
and you've imported a database

00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:32,880
and as you can see in the url bar there

00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:35,040
we put this in the browser now we have a

00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:38,560
fully live site

00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:40,160
now there's a lot of opportunities for

00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:43,440
further automation

00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,440
beyond just this

00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,600
especially when we're talking about

00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,760
drupal sites

00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,959
there's a lot of steps that are

00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:53,440
necessary

00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:55,279
um let's say if you're not checked out

00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:58,720
from your default branch

00:10:55,279 --> 00:11:00,399
um and with the with the latest database

00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,120
so we we get the latest database from

00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:03,920
production

00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:05,040
we're assuming uh but let's say you

00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,040
check out a branch and that has

00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,920
configuration changes or that has new

00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,880
code that has

00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:12,240
uh that has update hooks all of those

00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,680
need to be run

00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,760
now if we're going back to our

00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:17,519
hypothetical of someone new to the team

00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:20,000
maybe they're a front-end specialist

00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:20,880
maybe they're a designer and they you

00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,720
know also

00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,720
even for myself as someone who has been

00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:27,680
working in drupal for a long time

00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,240
i can't say that i remember every time

00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,920
to

00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,279
when i check out a new branch to run

00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:35,040
composer install

00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:38,000
to import the database to um

00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:39,519
run up db to run config import there's a

00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,040
fair number of steps that

00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:43,440
you know if you know what's on that

00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:45,120
branch you could figure out well i don't

00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:47,519
need to run config import this time

00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:49,760
because there's no configuration changes

00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:50,720
but you might forget or you might have

00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:54,240
someone who's

00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:56,959
less experienced with drupal who

00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:59,600
isn't familiar with when you need to run

00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:01,839
a config import versus when you need to

00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,279
run an update so there's some

00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:06,160
opportunities to

00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:08,000
automate more of that um this is a

00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:12,160
repository that is open source

00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:14,560
um and this is a command line tool that

00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:16,240
um we use on a number of our projects to

00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:19,360
make it easy for someone to

00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:21,040
start up and do all those tasks and it's

00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:24,399
built on top of lando

00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:27,600
um this may not be

00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:29,120
directly useful to you because um there

00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,240
are some assumptions in this code about

00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,560
our projects

00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,600
um but there's a lot of inspiration i

00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:36,399
think available

00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:38,399
if you check out the code and see what

00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:40,639
you could automate we use robo

00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:42,800
to do this which is a php task runner

00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:46,560
and that's what rush is built upon so

00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:48,320
um what we've done is we take lando we

00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,839
run lando start

00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,079
but then we also download the latest

00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:55,120
database

00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:56,160
um you know automatically we import that

00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,560
database we run

00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,920
uh drush deploy which runs config import

00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,760
cache clear and those

00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:03,519
and those steps so we run through all

00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:07,279
that and at the very end as i showed

00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:09,839
then you have a fully loaded site and

00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:10,639
that developer can be confident that

00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:14,720
everything is

00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:17,920
as intended um and imported to drupal

00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,639
um hopefully everything works but if it

00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,560
doesn't

00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:21,839
they can be confident that well it's not

00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,200
because they missed a step

00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:26,240
it's because something's wrong and they

00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:28,720
need to give some feedback

00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,440
uh we have a couple minutes for

00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,560
questions

00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:35,680
uh so if anybody has a question

00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:38,560
please uh drop it into the chat

00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:39,600
um i see a question about multi-site

00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:42,959
setup

00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:46,480
with lando um

00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:49,600
totally possible we do it um there's

00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,880
some assumptions about whether you might

00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,440
want to

00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:55,360
create a separate database service for

00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:57,760
every site as opposed to one database

00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:00,320
service that contains all the databases

00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:02,000
if i'm remembering correctly we are

00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:05,360
setting up a separate database service

00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,120
for each one um

00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:09,040
oh i see a q a tab thank you for

00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:11,360
reminding me

00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,360
um

00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,560
so i have a question uh that says how do

00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:20,800
i update my production site

00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:22,320
uh i'm not sure i understand but i can

00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:24,399
just to clarify like

00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,360
so lando's for local development using

00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:28,880
docker

00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:30,000
um yeah there is some uh pantheon

00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:32,399
integration

00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,519
um and i believe there might be some

00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:36,079
platform.sh

00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:36,800
integration and beta and the idea behind

00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:39,519
that

00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:40,079
is that you'd have one config file that

00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:42,959
would

00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:44,800
um that would be able to be used for all

00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:46,959
of these so even if you don't

00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,959
use that integration it's just separate

00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:52,240
config files you can still change those

00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:54,240
and i find that sometimes useful i like

00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,839
to you know update our development

00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,560
environments first

00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:59,360
if as we're talking about version so uh

00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,639
we want to

00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:03,360
you know have everyone running

00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:05,839
development let's just say php 74

00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,279
before production is running 74. we want

00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:10,240
qa to be running 7-4

00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:12,000
before that there's a question about

00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:14,800
comparison with docker compose

00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,959
so lando is built on top of docker so

00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:21,040
it's adding functionality on top of that

00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:21,040
but um the

00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:24,240
i don't think that there's anything i

00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,160
mean you could

00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,360
roll your own essentially but if there's

00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,120
um

00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,639
it's a value add from from what i

00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:34,160
understand

00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:36,639
um i i see quite lots of questions

00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,440
um lando was broken because i updated

00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:41,440
docker

00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,839
um i would downgrade docker um i do not

00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,959
keep

00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:48,560
i uh don't auto update docker

00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:50,480
and i try to keep track of

00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:52,240
what is the latest version that lando

00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:56,399
supports and i don't

00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:58,880
move past that um

00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:00,160
i see a question comparing it to dev uh

00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:02,800
i have used dev

00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:04,000
and but not in a while um and i had good

00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:07,519
experiences with it

00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:10,079
but um at the time um

00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:10,720
when i experimented with lando it was

00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:13,600
just an

00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,160
easier on-ramp and uh and everything

00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,639
worked

00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,600
so i haven't had a compelling reason to

00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:19,120
um
