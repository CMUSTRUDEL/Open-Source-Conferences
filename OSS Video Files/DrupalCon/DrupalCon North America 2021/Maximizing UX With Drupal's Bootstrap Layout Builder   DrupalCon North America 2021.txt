okay

00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:13,840
um thank you all for joining our session

00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:17,119
today

00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:17,600
um today we're going to have here with

00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:20,240
me

00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,279
aaron and mahmoud both of our software

00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:24,000
architects

00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:24,720
and myself maya um as the lead designer

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,640
that worked

00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:32,000
on the drupal's layout builder module

00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:34,800
so before we even kind of start with

00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,600
how we wanted to approach the design and

00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,760
development

00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,120
of the module we kind of took a step

00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:42,239
back and

00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:44,320
looked at our approach um that we do for

00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:47,680
between designers and developers

00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:51,120
at imagex we of course

00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:52,879
had a massive list of things that

00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,160
we knew that it doesn't work for

00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:57,199
designers

00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:59,039
and even more so things that

00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:00,559
it was a pain point for our developers

00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,359
so you know they had to do

00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:04,080
code reworks and um you know later on in

00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:06,880
the qa

00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,840
process we would catch stuff or you know

00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:11,040
sometimes

00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,159
um you know we just had bigger um more

00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,040
challenging part

00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:15,040
you know um

00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:20,479
problems when we uh went down the

00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:23,520
development route

00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:25,119
and then we're gonna try to list all the

00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,600
things that we should do

00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:28,320
um so we knew that from the design side

00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,320
we can pull

00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,680
more weight on doing things that are

00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:34,720
more fundamental

00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,840
providing components and ui kits making

00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,840
sure everything is

00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,320
kind of responsive and just bring more

00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:43,280
consistency

00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:45,200
throughout our design process um at the

00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,680
end when it gets to developers we knew

00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,759
that the

00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,520
kind of the handover process wasn't as

00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:50,880
smooth so we tried to kind of smooth

00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,520
that too

00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:55,280
and in general for developers just

00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,040
building a modular components

00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,520
that are responsive out of the box that

00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:03,200
was kind of main thing that we wanted to

00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,680
uh tackle so as soon as we finished up

00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,079
this

00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,200
and realized what didn't work for us and

00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:08,800
work work for us

00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,520
we knew that of course presenting to you

00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:14,239
guys um not always everything

00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,280
uh works exactly um the way that it

00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:17,440
worked for us

00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,040
but if we provide some principles for

00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,760
you that's something that you can then

00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,959
take away

00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:26,160
and apply maybe one of five to your uh

00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:27,680
organization so here i have five guiding

00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:30,879
principles for smooth

00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:33,840
design and development collaboration

00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:34,640
so the first one first um two side of

00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,040
the same

00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,400
coin so we realized that i mean even

00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,959
though you know it's

00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,720
uh we are designers and then of course

00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,400
we work with developers

00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,480
we knew that we kind of do the same

00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,080
thing and um

00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,720
i know as a designer we love to talk

00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,800
about design systems and developers talk

00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,080
about their modular codes and how easy

00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,480
is it to maintain

00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,959
but we really knew that designers need

00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:00,400
to have basic knowledge of the code and

00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:04,319
you know same as how developers

00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:07,599
understand topography in layout

00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:09,280
the second point really is to

00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:10,640
let's get involved real soon in the

00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,680
process so if

00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,159
you have a design project um we need to

00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,400
start

00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:18,560
involving developers right away so that

00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,280
if we hit any problems we can solve it

00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,959
together

00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,480
and then it will be kind of more

00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:25,840
efficient and i think the same

00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:28,000
as if you have an only um

00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,680
something that you want developers to

00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,360
focus sometimes having it your

00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,400
perspective from design that's something

00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:36,159
that can

00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,680
make the process a lot smoother

00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:39,120
um that's something that i brought up a

00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,720
little bit earlier but it is pretty

00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,959
important to just spend time on

00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,080
handovers i mean as a designer we hit

00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,000
the project

00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,760
you have to bump through it you have to

00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,159
finish it fast and then

00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,840
when it comes to that handover usually

00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:53,439
it's just this quick handover of like

00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,280
things to the developers but

00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:56,720
you realize that it's a lot more than

00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,439
that it's a checkbox

00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,959
of asking do you have all the assets do

00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,080
you know exactly how the micro

00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,400
interaction works

00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,120
you do you have you know how can you do

00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,280
the inspect

00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,120
and everything's smooth so that was a

00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:12,239
very important aspect for us that we

00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:14,799
wanted to tackle with this project

00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:15,360
and not to pick any favorites but this

00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:17,680
one is

00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,359
kind of my favorite it's simple it's

00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:22,479
about kind of being flexible

00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:24,720
um throughout the process um sometimes

00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:26,800
you might get fixated as a designer on

00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,800
certain approach that you think works

00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,000
but just having that one-on-one

00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,479
conversation with the

00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
developer throughout the process that's

00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:36,400
something that is very crucial

00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,360
to change things problem solve and kind

00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,520
of carry on

00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,479
with the next big thing that you gotta

00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,680
do together

00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:46,240
and sometimes it also could be like a

00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,880
mini knowledge in terms of okay i found

00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,720
this cool library maybe you can use it

00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,240
in the project instead of just kind of

00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,240
explaining everything you can make

00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,000
things visual and just send links to one

00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,880
another and kind of make it more

00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,080
uh collaborative in that sense and

00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,720
lastly

00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,680
just a general uh knowledge here and

00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,600
that would be

00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,039
you know having regular meetings between

00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,880
designers and developers

00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:10,160
so at imagex what we do is that we

00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,320
huddle once a month

00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,479
or sometimes if you have a lot of

00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:17,120
projects every other month

00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:19,199
where we talk about just the struggles

00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,960
that we have it might be a serious topic

00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:24,400
and it might be as simple as

00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:26,400
okay guys look i found this really cool

00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:29,520
library i found this really cool design

00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:31,440
we can we can apply to our next project

00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,720
um so kind of taking you through all of

00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,720
this um

00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,639
was some sort of foundation that can

00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:39,280
help with our organization

00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,840
um when it comes to the collaboration

00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,600
and then

00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,360
one thing that we started implementing

00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:46,880
of course the most fun part

00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:50,080
it was the bootstrap layout builder

00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:53,759
and we kind of took the same approach

00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:55,840
um we talked about okay let's start

00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:58,080
you know go to the beginning and let's

00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:00,000
bring storm together so aaron ramod and

00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:03,440
i we kind of put down the road map

00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,600
um look at everything that we needed

00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:08,080
and kind of went to the wires and trying

00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:11,360
to dissect every little item

00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,840
of the design we of course then took

00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,080
that

00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,919
and started kind of building these atoms

00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:18,080
using atomic design

00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:19,680
in our process so we had the foundation

00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:22,240
like type

00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,680
theme colors icons buttons and so on and

00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,560
so forth of course you know the list is

00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,720
quite long

00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:29,680
but really breaking down all the little

00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:33,440
components before we build things like

00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:36,000
our plugins which is more like our

00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,800
molecules or components that we built

00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,479
together

00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,000
and of course there's a lot that i can

00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:43,440
talk about but i'm gonna

00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:46,800
hand it over to uh the two

00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:49,440
gurus of the the code um aaron and

00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,800
mamu to take you through more of the

00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:54,240
development process

00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:56,639
of drupal's bootstrap layout builder

00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,639
thank you

00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,840
thanks maya

00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,479
hello guys my name is mahmoud zaid i'm

00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:11,919
software architect at

00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:14,240
imagex media today

00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:16,800
i'm talking going to talk about

00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:20,000
visualizing the layout builder

00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:22,479
since 2017 drupalcon

00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,560
uh grace announced the layout builder

00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:28,479
module which become later

00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,479
a drupal core module

00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:35,039
i have decided to

00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,720
bought some inputs by some contributed

00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:40,479
modules i did research

00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:43,520
i checked um many of premium

00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:46,400
also open source visualizing

00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:47,840
tools over the last 10 years the

00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,919
responsive web design has

00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:51,280
changed the way we think for the web and

00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:54,400
there are many

00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:57,599
awesome tools helps

00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:59,280
help the people build landing pages

00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:02,000
without touching

00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:03,360
uh the technical stuff without touching

00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,639
the code

00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:10,319
so we have decided at

00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:13,360
imagex last year to

00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:14,240
bring all this initiative to uh to the

00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,479
community

00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,400
we have developed three modules

00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,960
bootstrap styles bootstrap layout

00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:23,759
builder

00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:28,160
layout builder blogs to dive more about

00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:29,919
this approach as maya mentioned

00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,280
there are two approaches on the design

00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:34,640
atomic design

00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:38,320
also as a component based design

00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:41,360
which all based on don't repeat yourself

00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:43,760
concept when we define the atom reuse

00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:47,600
the same styles over and over again

00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:52,160
when we see this atom in the page

00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:55,920
again so uh as you all know drupal based

00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:58,560
on render array approach so all elements

00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:02,160
that render in the front end

00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:03,440
uh based on nested array which contain

00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:06,480
all the structure

00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:09,519
of the page if we can inject

00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:12,160
this structure especially

00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:12,720
the attributes part we should be able to

00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:16,000
add

00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:18,000
classes or any other attributes if we

00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,600
are dealing with javascript maybe

00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:24,160
that dash x attribute

00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,640
so we have created bootstrap styles

00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,680
which

00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:31,760
is we call it the styles

00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:34,560
plugin inventory style plugin inventory

00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:37,600
its responsibility is to do the mapping

00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:39,839
between the developer and site builders

00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,360
the developer can define classes can

00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:44,080
define

00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:46,080
any configuration from admin panel and

00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:48,839
the site builder should see

00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:50,560
a visual tool he can just go ahead and

00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:53,920
click

00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:56,080
whatever the option he needs and focus

00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,279
and the content and building the page

00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:01,279
without touching

00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:05,600
any uh complex technical stuff

00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:09,200
so bootstrap styles we have added

00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:11,839
this plugins to it and also

00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,399
it's responsible for user discovery for

00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:15,920
any

00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:18,959
module utilize this plugins

00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,279
as a concept it's a bit uh ambiguity now

00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:22,480
but

00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:25,440
it will become simpler in next slide

00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:27,279
but uh the main objective of this slide

00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,920
we need to know that bootstrap

00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:32,240
styles as the styles plugin inventory

00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,120
bootstrap layout builder is responsible

00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:36,640
for creating

00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:38,959
dynamic layouts and also reuse

00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:40,160
uh or utilize the bootstrap styles

00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:42,800
module

00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:44,240
in the section element render array

00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:47,440
layout builder blocks

00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:50,880
do the same job but responsible for

00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:51,600
uh managing the blocks inside the layout

00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,160
builder

00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,360
and also reuse the same atoms reuse the

00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:58,640
same plugins

00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:01,040
from both strap styles and

00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:03,440
it's not only for this two modules you

00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:07,680
can define your own module

00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:10,640
or anyone can contribute a new module

00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:14,560
based on both strap styles and reuse

00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:19,360
these plugins over and over again

00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:23,040
so let's dig more on bootstrap styles

00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:27,200
the plugins groups that i mentioned

00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:29,600
it's a collection of

00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,600
sections you can call it sections like

00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:34,720
background typography spacing

00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,040
border shadow animation it's not limited

00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,399
to

00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,800
this groups but you can define your own

00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:42,640
group

00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:43,519
or you can remove override any of these

00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:47,360
groups

00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:50,880
each group a plugin group contain

00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:54,480
one or more style

00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:55,200
plugin when i speak about slide plugin

00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,920
means

00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,560
for example background color background

00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:03,279
image

00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:10,720
background video maybe animation

00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:13,839
bedding margin and so on

00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:17,200
how to define a new style plugin simply

00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:19,760
you need to go to your module or

00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:21,440
if you like to contribute back to uh the

00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:25,200
plugin inventory which is

00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:28,560
bootstrap styles module bus

00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:32,079
src plugin bootstrap styles styles

00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:35,120
then you can define the plugin

00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:37,760
for style or the group itself both

00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,720
using the same data structure which is

00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:41,680
plugin

00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,800
why plugin plugin is so popular uh

00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,880
design button

00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,920
and it's commonly used on drupal it's

00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:49,200
used in blocks

00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:52,480
used in views and everywhere on

00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:55,200
drupal you will find drupal count

00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,920
on this design button and here is the

00:12:55,200 --> 00:13:00,079
idea

00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:03,680
the idea is build open source tool

00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:07,279
this open source tool doesn't add any

00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:11,040
learning curve to the cms we are using

00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:14,000
so all we need to know about

00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:17,120
this from a developer point of view i

00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,839
need to define a plugin i need to

00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,399
implement like three groups of function

00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:22,880
the first

00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:24,240
group of function can define the admin

00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:27,600
panel configuration

00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:30,800
like the classes uh any configuration

00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:33,120
needed to be retrieved on the front end

00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,639
the second group deal with the layout

00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,720
builder form

00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:38,560
which is when you click configure

00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:41,120
section or add a new section

00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:42,560
you see the form when you click update

00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:45,760
and add the label

00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:48,959
this uh group injects this section and

00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:52,000
adds a visualizing tools based on

00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:55,360
the defined configuration build

00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:58,000
it's like any drupal build function

00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:00,000
it's responsible of retrieving the

00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,680
configurations that saved from layout

00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,279
builder form

00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:08,399
to the component storage and converted

00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:12,800
to the render array so if we save

00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:15,839
for example background color we can

00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:18,720
retrieve the element itself and

00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:19,680
inject the render array attributes with

00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,880
the class

00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:26,160
or within line style whatever as a

00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:29,839
plugin define

00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:33,760
here is the example background color

00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:37,519
this uh plugin

00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:39,519
is extend style plugin base

00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:42,000
builds the configuration form the first

00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:44,000
group as you can see in the screen

00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,440
we have defined the classes you can

00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,959
remove edit

00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:52,399
whatever as you want also

00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:54,720
uh we have defined only one

00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:55,440
field here you can define one or more

00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:59,199
fields

00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:01,760
in the same form for the configuration

00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:02,800
so every component every plugin is a

00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:06,079
standalone

00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:09,279
you can configure what you need

00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:10,000
from admin bundle point of view and what

00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:13,199
do you need

00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,040
on the section

00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:17,199
the layout builder configure section

00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:20,880
module or off-campus module

00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:24,000
and also how we can convert this on

00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:27,199
the build function so the second

00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:30,320
group we retrieved the

00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:33,120
defined clauses on the previous step and

00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:36,000
we have attached here a library this

00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:39,199
library attached javascript and css

00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,560
symbol files that convert this classes

00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:42,720
to this circles

00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,839
and assemble animation so we can

00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:47,279
interact

00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:48,480
with the tools and when we select for

00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:52,320
example background

00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,639
color the green option this green option

00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,120
it's

00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:56,160
inject the render array of the page and

00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:59,680
add

00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:02,720
the define the classes so let's change

00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:04,560
the section element uh as you can see on

00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,720
the screen

00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:08,079
so this is the main responsibility of

00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:11,199
put strap styles

00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:12,800
let's see how we can apply or reuse

00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:15,920
these plugins on

00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:19,680
uh bootstrap layout builder or

00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:19,680
the community called bleb

00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:24,720
bleb as i mentioned it's a

00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:27,839
responsibility to define

00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:29,279
or to uh we call it the grid system

00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:31,360
manager

00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:32,560
you can define the breakpoints like

00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:36,320
desktop tablet

00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:37,040
any other breakpoint as you want in each

00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,920
breakpoint

00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:41,680
you can connect it with the layout so

00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:45,279
for example in mobile you can

00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:48,639
have option to show uh 50 50 or

00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:51,279
100 percent so from edge to edge

00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:52,560
as a screen and every breakpoint you

00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:56,480
have the ability to

00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:59,600
configure its layout

00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:02,639
so um the default

00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:04,799
configure section or off-campus which

00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:08,240
come with drubal core modules come

00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:10,959
only with one field which is the label

00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:12,559
let's allow you to give a name to your

00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:15,360
section

00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:16,799
we have converted this to three tabs the

00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:19,280
first tab

00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:20,319
responsibility is to manage the grid you

00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:23,120
can

00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:24,959
uh first choose the container type

00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:29,200
whether it's from edgy to edge

00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:32,160
or boxed or fall with 15 pixel margin

00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:33,200
in both sides also you can choose if you

00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:36,720
like to have

00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:38,480
a gutter between uh the columns or as

00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:41,679
regions

00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:44,720
and you can choose which

00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:45,679
option you like to activate for each

00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:49,280
breakpoint so

00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:50,080
in desktop you have two regions side by

00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:52,720
side

00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:54,080
in tablet i would like to switch this to

00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:58,799
be 100

00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:58,799
so it will appear above each other

00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:04,720
um the second

00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:07,760
tab here is a connection happen

00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:10,880
it's utilize the bootstrap styles it's

00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:12,559
reuse the same plugins again with its

00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:15,360
configuration everything

00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:17,360
uh the same but we have option at this

00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:19,039
module because this module utilizes

00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:21,760
bootstrap styles

00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:22,080
you have a magic function which allow to

00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:25,039
use

00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:26,000
restricted plugins so you can enable

00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:28,720
disable

00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,720
the plugins itself so for example in

00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:34,080
spacing if you disable

00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:37,440
margin and padding the group itself will

00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:40,880
uh disappear the certainty tab

00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:44,080
will uh shows your settings

00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:44,559
if you like to add uh advanced settings

00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,520
like

00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:48,160
hard code or sorry if you defined any

00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:51,360
class and

00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:54,400
like to add a direct here without create

00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:57,280
a specific plugin to

00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,160
uh to implement it you can go ahead and

00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:01,280
add your

00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:04,160
classes add any uh attributes

00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:05,919
from this panel but i don't recommend

00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:08,720
this approach because

00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:10,000
the basic idea is visualizing make

00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:13,039
everything for the site

00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,880
builder for the client for uh the

00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:18,240
content editor

00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,960
can easy drag and drop select you can

00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:22,000
see

00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:26,400
what we are doing when we build a

00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:29,760
as a page layout builder blocks

00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:34,240
as i mentioned it's a responsibility

00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:36,960
uh it's like collect

00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:38,160
the block configuration and devoted on

00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:41,760
content tab

00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:43,120
the second tab also it's utilized both

00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:46,480
strap styles

00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:49,600
and as you can see on the right image

00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:52,640
we have the same plugins group again

00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:54,720
and of course we have

00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:56,880
we have the option to restrict these

00:19:54,720 --> 00:20:00,000
plugins

00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:03,120
not only for all blocks but also

00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:07,760
for a pair block type or pair

00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:10,960
block instant so

00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:13,840
imagine we have a section the section is

00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,720
an element this element can contain one

00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:18,000
or more

00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:21,200
block inside each block

00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:23,919
is also elements so you can choose

00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:25,840
all the styles of this hierarchy

00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:29,440
elements

00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:32,960
section library of after we implement

00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:36,000
all this stuff and we have a tools that

00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:38,400
allow us to change the style of

00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:41,840
all the components of the page we need

00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:45,760
to reuse this styles over and over again

00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:49,760
but and as a template so

00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:51,520
section library is a module allow you to

00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:53,039
create a template for section or

00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:55,600
multiple section

00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:57,200
and when we say multiple section it's

00:20:55,600 --> 00:21:02,960
mean you can also

00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:06,799
take a template for uh for a page

00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:07,120
uh these are very quickly our modules

00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:10,159
but

00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:13,440
the next release

00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:16,559
we are going to add the live preview

00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:19,679
which mean when you change anything

00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:22,960
on the section on the

00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:23,600
configure section you will see at real

00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,840
time

00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:27,919
on the page without hit update and

00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,400
refresh the section by ajax you will see

00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:31,520
out

00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:35,600
on real time the same

00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:38,080
also for responsive we have added

00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:39,280
like a configuration that allow you to

00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:42,840
define

00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:46,880
the responsive devices for

00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:50,000
your uh your

00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:53,520
section so you can switch

00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,919
to mobile to tablet to any other device

00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:58,720
pre-configured from the admin panel

00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:59,360
and also when you change any styles from

00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:02,559
here

00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:03,919
you can see it on real time and also it

00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:06,799
will allow you for example

00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:07,280
if you have a different backgrounds in

00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:10,000
both

00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:11,200
desktop and mobile you can have

00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,840
background color

00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,559
and mobile and for example in desktop

00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:18,000
you can have

00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:20,799
a background video or image to save the

00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,480
performance to enhance the performance

00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:26,400
so

00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:30,240
our roadmap uh we are now

00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:34,000
on bootstrap styles 1.0.3

00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:38,640
beb 2.0.1

00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:41,760
layout builder blocks 1.0.1

00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:44,799
section library beta version our gold by

00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:47,919
june 2021 add and

00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:50,960
more and add and merge more plugins so

00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:53,520
if you guys also um

00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:55,679
have like any plugin and you feel it's

00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:58,080
reusable enough

00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:59,039
you can go ahead and contribute it and

00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:01,120
of course we

00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:02,480
are going to include it if it's a

00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:04,159
general case

00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,679
uh we are going to release the

00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:06,960
responsive as i mentioned in the

00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:10,559
previous slide

00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:13,360
along with live preview also

00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:14,880
adds the ability to style the region or

00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:18,640
inject the plugins

00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:23,600
in regions itself and build more complex

00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:26,880
grid which is great inside grid

00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:27,440
also in layout builder blocks right now

00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:31,679
you

00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:34,000
uh you can style by plugins

00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:35,200
the rubber of the block itself we're

00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,600
going to add

00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:39,360
the ability to style field groups or the

00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:42,480
field itself inside

00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:44,159
the block so you can choose which field

00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:47,760
you wanna style

00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:50,400
and it will load the plugins and inject

00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:51,600
this filled render array section library

00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:54,799
our goal to

00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:58,559
release a stable version uh

00:23:54,799 --> 00:24:01,679
by december 2021 we are looking for

00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:04,240
of course merge mode plugins uh add the

00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:05,440
import export feature to section library

00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:08,880
module so

00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,880
you can send

00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:14,400
templates between different environments

00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:17,840
different environments of the same

00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:18,720
project also we are studying to make it

00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:21,919
global

00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:24,240
agency so if agency have

00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:25,840
multiple projects maybe you can have

00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:29,360
your own

00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:32,480
hub or styles hub so you can share

00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:35,520
all across many uh projects

00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:38,400
uh also we are looking for creating

00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:39,600
the blocks ready made so you for example

00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:43,440
if you like to add

00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:48,159
hiro banner uh bing bong blocks uh

00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:51,039
cards etc we should have like a module

00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:52,880
or sort of uh some modules that have

00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:56,320
this pre-made

00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:57,440
blocks that utilize also both strap

00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:00,480
styles and

00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:03,120
implement the same approach and again

00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:05,200
uh feel free guys to contribute if you

00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:08,799
have any idea if you have

00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:11,360
any module that

00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:12,240
compatible with our approach we are here

00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:15,440
to help

00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:19,279
and now it's the time to jump

00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:22,320
to a quick demo so i will hand it over

00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:26,240
to aaron he will show you

00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:30,159
um all the concepts that i described on

00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:30,159
on his demo thank you guys

00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:39,360
hey guys uh sorry about that my power

00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:42,559
went out

00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:43,279
impeccable timing so i'm just getting my

00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:45,840
docker

00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:46,640
uh up and it should be here in a minute

00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,559
so

00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:50,880
if we have any questions that we want to

00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:52,000
take uh for the next minute or so that

00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:57,679
might

00:25:52,000 --> 00:26:00,960
help fill the awkward silence

00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:04,640
i saw that there was one for me oh

00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:11,840
i do have my environment set up

00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:11,840
we'll start sharing that's around

00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:17,120
all right so um here is the the demo

00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:20,960
that we usually

00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:23,679
um show for other drupal events

00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:25,279
um i'm excited because obviously this

00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:28,480
module has

00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:31,360
come quite a far ways

00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:33,600
in uh the year or so that we've started

00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:37,039
developing it i think we introduced a

00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:40,159
maybe drupalcon global last year um

00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:43,919
and so since then we've brought on

00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:47,360
uh maya and she's uh overhauled the

00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:49,760
the whole um off-canvas um

00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:50,799
styling or sorry the design and then

00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:54,240
i've come in there

00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:57,440
and helped out with the front end so um

00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:58,799
yeah i'm excited to show uh a little bit

00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:00,000
of the demo today i know that we're

00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:01,919
running

00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,480
pretty tight on time so try to do a

00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:07,840
little bit of a high level here

00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:10,880
i just have a very basic blt uh theme

00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:14,480
setup and a custom theme

00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:17,440
that has bootstrap 4 on it

00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:19,360
and so other than that there's not a ton

00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:22,880
of modules that i have it's pretty

00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:24,240
basic site here and then

00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:26,640
the only thing that i've done in my

00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:28,480
theme is i've set up our color palettes

00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:31,520
which

00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:33,679
because bootstrap layout builder is

00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:36,000
mainly class based you're just going to

00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:38,880
be inputting classes on the back end

00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,559
like css classes on the backend through

00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:44,000
some configuration forms

00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:48,399
and then it'll appear in your guys's

00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:49,919
editor so for example um

00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:51,520
if you've been using layout builder and

00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:54,320
you've had

00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:55,200
problems with the responsive uh portion

00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,880
of that that's

00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,640
the whole reason why we developed this

00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:01,520
module uh

00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:02,000
and i'm i've basically just put in a

00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:04,720
bunch of

00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,840
text blocks for the most part using some

00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:09,520
wysiwyg text

00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:10,640
and then dropped them into our columns

00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:14,000
here

00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:16,880
so if you hit configure on your

00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,360
banner this is our off canvas menu that

00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:20,399
um

00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:23,200
i was talking about um my uh with the

00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:26,240
beautiful design that she provided us

00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,960
so uh the first portion is the layout

00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,279
tab that

00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:31,440
that handles all the responsive uh grid

00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:34,640
stuff for you guys

00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:37,600
we're using a bootstrap

00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:39,279
framework so we have a couple different

00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:43,039
layout options in here

00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:46,240
like boxed full edge to edge which just

00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:48,399
goes right left to right without the the

00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:50,799
paddings or the gutters on the side

00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:52,480
uh also have the ability to remove

00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:55,600
gutters within

00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:57,200
the sections here and then you have also

00:28:55,600 --> 00:29:00,640
the ability to update

00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:03,760
some of the grids so

00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:07,840
uh one feature that we've added recently

00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:12,480
is the live preview so

00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:14,399
basically as we're toggling throughout

00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,760
the plugins and we're applying different

00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:18,159
um

00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:19,120
different types of uh styling whether

00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:20,880
it's padding or

00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:22,480
background colors and things like that

00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:24,320
that should update it

00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:25,840
on your screen in front of you that's

00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:28,799
nice little uh

00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:31,120
user enhancement or user experience

00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:33,760
enhancement that we've added

00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:35,840
and the other piece that mahmoud was

00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:36,960
talking about was the responsive portion

00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:39,279
which

00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:41,440
we're actively developing right now i'm

00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:43,760
on a feature branch so if there's any

00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:45,279
weird quirks that happen through this

00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,559
little demo i'm going to blame it on

00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:49,840
that

00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:50,880
but for the most part we have most of

00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,480
the features in

00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:55,200
and now it's just a lot of like internal

00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:55,919
bug fixings before we move it up to the

00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,480
um

00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:59,120
1x or 2x branch depending on which

00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:02,559
module

00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:05,039
uh we're working on so

00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:06,399
uh i'm just going to click uh like the

00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:08,080
50 50

00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:10,880
i know we have a there's a little bug

00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:12,559
with the media module

00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:14,640
so i'm just going to use a background

00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:17,679
color for now but you can see

00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:21,039
as you start to apply um different

00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:23,919
pieces of the plug-in groups

00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:25,039
it should automatically live update for

00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:28,559
you there's no longer

00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:31,039
the need for clicking on the update

00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:33,200
button and then having your page reload

00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:36,880
obviously that can be pretty cumbersome

00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:38,640
if you're like a content marketer and

00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:41,600
you know you're just trying to test out

00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:43,360
a couple things and see how they look

00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:45,200
this is a nice little little feature

00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:47,840
here as well

00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:48,399
the other portion was the responsive

00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:51,679
piece

00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:53,039
so right now we've added in uh basically

00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:57,440
a little previewer

00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:59,840
um and this is hopefully uh gonna help

00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:01,600
um you guys as you're building your

00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,320
landing pages see what what it looks

00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:05,519
like on

00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:07,440
on different devices and then obviously

00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:11,440
you can

00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:11,440
live update things as well in here

00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:21,519
so um going back into

00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:23,919
all all devices we'll just take you back

00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:25,360
out of like little responsive previewer

00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:27,519
and then you guys can start playing

00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:31,360
around again with uh

00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:33,919
with some of the options in here

00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:35,519
so i don't know why that went to you to

00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:38,159
red even though we're

00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:39,120
got uh yellow but again we're working

00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:42,240
with uh

00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:44,159
a new feature here so um

00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:45,600
uh yeah there's probably a couple little

00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:47,519
little quarks that we need to work out

00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:49,919
still

00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:51,760
moving on to some of the other sections

00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:54,799
though

00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:57,519
if i click configure as well on here

00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:58,080
you can see that you can automatically

00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:01,440
adjust

00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:02,240
based on desktop tablet or mobile these

00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,600
are all

00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:05,360
breakpoints that are set up in the

00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:08,080
backend as well so if you

00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:09,279
if you're only trying to target mobile

00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:11,519
and desktop you don't

00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:12,880
necessarily need tablet or if you need

00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:16,640
another breakpoint

00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:18,159
you can add you can add that in as well

00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:20,080
and again these are these are mainly

00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:23,360
class-based

00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:24,640
components so for example bootstrap uses

00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:28,720
like

00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:30,399
call md lg excel things like that

00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,919
so that's where you set up your your

00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:35,039
base class and then

00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:39,919
your columns will will conform to

00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:39,919
that based on the the breakpoint

00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:44,080
so uh i'll just update this you guys can

00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:48,960
kind of see

00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:48,960
what some of these uh little features do

00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,840
so that's just uh these are gutters

00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:59,360
that's the the spacing that happens

00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:01,440
between your columns

00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:02,640
uh sometimes when you're building like a

00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:05,039
banner

00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:06,720
you don't want that that extra 15 pixels

00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:08,559
as the default padding

00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:10,399
uh on the left and the right you want to

00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:13,360
to span full width of your screen

00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:15,120
so that's um this is kind of the optimal

00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,760
configuration where you'd have edge to

00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:19,519
edge with

00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:20,960
um no gutters and then your background

00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:22,960
layout builder does add a little bit of

00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:24,399
padding throughout its sections so that

00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:27,360
you're

00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:29,120
able to more easily see the the the

00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:30,559
section that you're editing but this one

00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:35,760
for example

00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:35,760
is that full full width um

00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:43,679
full width banner here which

00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:43,679
we took a look at previously

00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:49,760
and this is uh that padding that we

00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,760
removed

00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:54,720
and uh yeah there's a couple other

00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:58,159
plugins that we've um

00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:58,640
been adding so um typography is one of

00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:00,960
them

00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:02,640
um that's just adding uh different color

00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:05,919
classes to your text sometimes

00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:08,000
as you start adding in um like a darker

00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:11,119
background color for your theme and then

00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,879
if your body text is black

00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:15,119
you're going to need some way to change

00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:17,440
that into white but

00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:18,800
rather than having all these custom

00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:22,720
classes

00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:26,159
that you would maybe add through like

00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:29,919
a class on

00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:31,919
another module or through your theme

00:34:29,919 --> 00:34:33,440
we wanted to bring that more into the

00:34:31,919 --> 00:34:35,760
layout building experience

00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:37,280
where you could do all this stuff on the

00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:40,399
fly

00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:40,720
um so i think the last little piece that

00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:43,839
i

00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:45,359
i wanted to touch on was i'll just take

00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:48,079
you through some of the

00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:49,040
plugins so we have spacing you can add

00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:52,159
padding

00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:55,200
so these are like your your p classes

00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:58,560
margins are like those m dash 5

00:34:55,200 --> 00:35:01,200
classes so again you can have as many

00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:01,680
margin classes as you want or as little

00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:04,160
um

00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:05,040
you have the option to obviously just

00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:07,839
add

00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:09,280
padding extra margin on a specific side

00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:12,320
and then

00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:15,359
we also have the border option

00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:18,160
which allows things like rounded uh

00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:19,760
corners which is nice um you see that

00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:21,680
all the time with like cards

00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:23,440
rounded corners with like a drop shadow

00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:25,599
or something like that so you can

00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:27,839
start to combine combine your plugins

00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:30,320
and then

00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:32,240
as you build out some of your guys's

00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:34,800
components or your sections

00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:35,359
uh you're you have the ability now to

00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:38,160
save

00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:39,440
those in a template library which

00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:42,640
mahmoud

00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:43,599
touched on which is our section library

00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:46,480
module

00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:48,400
and that will just give you the ability

00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:51,680
to save it in its current

00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:55,440
state and then pick up a brand new page

00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:58,720
and start to import some of those

00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:59,920
configurations so i'll just uh give you

00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:03,280
a quick preview

00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:06,400
i've done this ahead of time i've um

00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:07,760
basically when we're some of our

00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:11,119
sections we'll

00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:13,520
um let's close this out first so

00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:14,800
there's a add to library button this

00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:17,920
gives you the option

00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:20,000
to give it a name and then an image

00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:21,119
so oftentimes we'll we'll flip over to

00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,920
the front end

00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:24,960
zoom out take a screenshot of that

00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:28,079
particular section

00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:32,079
upload it and then in the back end uh

00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:35,200
under content you'll see a

00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:36,960
layout builder library tab

00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:38,400
and these are all the sections so these

00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,119
are all layout builder sections that

00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:41,359
we've

00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:43,040
saved this one was like text on the left

00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:44,160
and then we had like an image component

00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:47,200
on the right

00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:48,240
that now saves into our library which we

00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:51,920
can

00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:54,640
then import on a brand new page so

00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:56,079
again i've created all these different

00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:59,280
sections

00:36:56,079 --> 00:37:02,400
some are templates and some are specific

00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:03,200
sections so sorry a template is a

00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:06,240
collection

00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:07,760
of the sections where a section is just

00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:10,960
that one

00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:14,400
particular column or row

00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:17,520
so if i just hit import you can see that

00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:21,280
it'll import the last save state of

00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:24,560
that particular section and then

00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:26,640
this is uh this is disconnected now from

00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:28,720
that original one so you can come in

00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:30,640
here and start to edit the text

00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:32,320
um but it gives you a great starting

00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:35,119
point and it's uh

00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:36,400
kind of our approach at rapid rapid

00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:39,599
prototyping

00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:40,240
so we really want to get basically pages

00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:43,920
built

00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:46,400
fast and as uh as efficient as possible

00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:48,720
again these are gonna continue to use

00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:51,839
all those configurations that you did

00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:53,760
previously before saving it so adding

00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:57,200
those paddings and those margins

00:37:53,760 --> 00:38:00,560
etc so that you can reuse it on

00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:04,000
another page so i think

00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:06,800
i'll probably leave it there um

00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,680
there is a couple extra modules that we

00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:10,079
we have been

00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:11,040
um starting to build out to create a

00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:14,480
little bit of a nicer

00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:17,280
ui and content editing experience

00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:19,200
so one of those is like block library

00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:22,000
basically it's just um

00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:22,720
the the next screen as i create a custom

00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,000
block

00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:28,640
gives us the ability to upload icons to

00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:30,880
our custom block library which obviously

00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:33,599
is a little bit nicer than just seeing

00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:34,400
some text within the right hand column

00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:36,079
there

00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:37,440
especially if you have several block

00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:40,079
types

00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:40,800
and then again with uh we we recommend

00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:43,119
using

00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:44,640
layout builder restrictions which will

00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:47,920
give you the option to

00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:50,640
limit the the block types per

00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:53,440
content type and just gives you a little

00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:55,920
bit more of a streamlined

00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:57,040
flow as you're doing training sessions

00:38:55,920 --> 00:39:00,960
with

00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:03,760
your clients and doing doing demos

00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:05,839
so uh yeah i'll leave it there thanks a

00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:09,520
lot guys for

00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:13,119
joining us and um i see there's

00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:14,880
a question from chris does this work

00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:16,960
with paragraphs

00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:17,920
uh yeah you can use it with paragraphs

00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:19,920
for sure we

00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:22,000
we've been using custom blocks just for

00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:24,960
the performance reasons but we have

00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:26,839
we have done multiple implementations of

00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:31,520
using paragraphs

00:39:26,839 --> 00:39:31,520
to to create our layouts as well

00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:38,720
amazing thanks erin

00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:40,400
yeah and for everyone kind of joining

00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:43,920
the session we took the

00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:46,560
uh qa questions that you all ask and

00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:48,320
we will just hop into our booth right

00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:51,680
now with three of us there

00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:53,520
for a q a uh with you all so

00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:56,320
we have the list of the question we'll

00:39:53,520 --> 00:40:00,400
get them answer in the booth

00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:00,400
and yeah thanks you all for for joining

00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:05,680
awesome thanks guys thank you
