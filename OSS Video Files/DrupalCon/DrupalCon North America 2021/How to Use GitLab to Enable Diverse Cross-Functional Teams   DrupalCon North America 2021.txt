hi everybody

00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:13,120
and welcome to my talk how to use gitlab

00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:16,720
to enable diverse

00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:19,359
and cross-functional teams

00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,920
my name is nurizi sanchez and i am the

00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:23,920
senior

00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:26,400
open source program manager at get lab

00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:28,840
formerly i was president and chairperson

00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,000
of the board of directors at the gnome

00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:32,079
foundation

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,840
and i currently run the git lab for open

00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:35,680
source program

00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,520
i have a background in product

00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:39,680
management program management

00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,120
project management and business

00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:44,480
operations

00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:47,520
and i use gitlab for my day-to-day job

00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:50,079
or my day job because of all of this i

00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,480
wanted to share some of the tricks

00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:53,360
that i've learned and how to use it and

00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,399
share some of my

00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:59,840
insights in using gitlab to enable

00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:59,840
cross-functional teams

00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:05,760
today we're going to go over why use git

00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:07,600
lab cross-functionally

00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,080
i want to talk a little bit about how to

00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:12,159
create the right environment

00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:15,280
and i'll give you some tips and tricks

00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:20,000
for non-engineers

00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:20,000
let's dive right in with why it matters

00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:24,840
when you create software there are lots

00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,680
of different stages

00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,960
that it goes through in order to be

00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:32,479
deployed

00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:35,520
for example the manage plan create

00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:38,960
verify package secure release

00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:42,079
configure and defend stages

00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:43,040
get lab is a single platform to enable

00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:45,840
the entire

00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,280
software development life cycle and in

00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,240
the image to the right

00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,200
you can see how we compare to a lot of

00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,520
different

00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,280
competitors for each of the different

00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:58,960
stages

00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:01,840
and so when you use a single platform

00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,799
you it's gitlab is not just a place to

00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,920
host code

00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:08,479
but it really is the entire

00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,200
platform for everybody to work on

00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:13,360
together

00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:13,360
in order to create the software

00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:19,200
using a single platform matters

00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,720
it gives you transparency into other

00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,120
teams work

00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:25,680
it creates easier communication because

00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:29,040
people aren't siloed

00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:31,840
and you are able to easily contribute to

00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,840
other teams

00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:37,040
i'd like to share a little bit about my

00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:39,599
own story in using gitlab

00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:41,280
i started using it through an open

00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:44,080
source community through

00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:46,480
my work at gnome and when i first

00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:50,640
started i was just doing strategy

00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:54,160
event planning and project management

00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:57,280
but once they they adopted git lab i

00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,400
dis i decided to start um editing the

00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,519
website pages

00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,480
because they were using gitlab pages and

00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:04,720
the markdown

00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,519
seemed easy enough for me to use it

00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,519
seemed you know

00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,200
very similar to google docs or other

00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:12,319
editors that i was

00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,360
familiar with and i started to do simple

00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:17,440
things like adding

00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:18,800
files because of that background when i

00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:21,200
joined git lab

00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,879
i had an easier time creating and

00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:26,640
reviewing merge requests

00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:29,360
and updating the get lab website and now

00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:31,120
i feel comfortable enough to look at

00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:34,080
other people's websites if they're

00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:36,000
hosted on gitlab or using gitlab pages

00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,519
and i can make merge requests and

00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,959
generally edit it

00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:40,560
and that's something that i didn't think

00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:43,519
that i would be able to do

00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:46,400
when i first started and what i think

00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:48,640
this highlights is a natural progression

00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,799
where when you start using a tool if

00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,239
you're in project management or just

00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:56,799
doing something that's

00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:58,480
you know not highly engineering focused

00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:01,040
you you start getting familiar with the

00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:02,720
tool and you start feeling that comfort

00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,480
and then you might end up doing

00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:08,720
engineering like things

00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,720
so it's a pretty cool progression

00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:13,360
and the reason why this matters is that

00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:18,000
we need a broader set

00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:19,680
of skills and diversity in open source

00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,759
and i want to challenge us to think

00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,560
beyond what the normal

00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:25,360
uh kind of idea of what skill set

00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,560
diversity

00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:31,199
is because i think that it's um

00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,160
now more common practice for people to

00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:34,400
recognize

00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,960
the documentation's important that

00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,960
design and ux

00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:41,040
but what about things like sales and

00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:43,280
business development

00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,639
people who either want to gain those

00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,840
skills or who are

00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,479
business professionals might be great at

00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:52,000
helping us

00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:54,800
fundraise or creating partnerships

00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,440
and people who are in the hr or people

00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,320
field

00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,040
or who are interested in those subjects

00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:02,080
might be

00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:05,280
awesome at helping out at places

00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:07,280
in in teams like the engagement team or

00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:10,240
sitting on the board of directors of an

00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:11,680
open source organization or helping with

00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,000
newcomers initiatives

00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,280
maybe thinking about retention and how

00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,759
to make processes

00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,759
easier

00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:24,960
so in order for that to happen

00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,680
you can't just you know wish that it

00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,199
will happen

00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,840
it's all about creating the right

00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:31,680
environment so i'd like to go over a few

00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:34,240
things that are necessary

00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,960
in order to set up the environment to

00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,000
enable

00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:41,039
the broader skill set and just regular

00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,120
other types of diversity

00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:45,919
the first is to constantly think about

00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:49,039
the non-engineering experience

00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:51,039
this influences a lot about what how you

00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:53,840
end up rolling things out

00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:54,479
and an example of this is that on our

00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,960
marketing

00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:59,039
on the get lab marketing website at the

00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,800
very bottom of each page

00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:03,280
there's something that says edit this

00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:06,160
page open in web ide

00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,720
and please contribute and so what this

00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,960
does

00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,160
is that for people who are not familiar

00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,319
with web editing

00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,720
they can just scroll to the very bottom

00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:15,840
click the edit this page or open in web

00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,160
ide

00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,880
and it opens up into an editor that

00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,400
again is

00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,800
very similar to google doc editor in

00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,000
that

00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,400
it you know lets you edit markdown which

00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,400
is

00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:31,600
pretty easy to get and there are cheat

00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,600
guides which i really love

00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,360
another thing that helps you create the

00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,039
right environment

00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:40,400
is making sure that the entire

00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:43,199
organization is aware of cross-cultural

00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,880
collaboration and i've given a few

00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:47,759
speeches about this

00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,000
i'm including a link to that below but

00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:49,919
there

00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,400
are cultures that have high context

00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:55,039
versus low context speech

00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,880
or they give negative feedback in

00:06:55,039 --> 00:07:00,240
different ways

00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:02,080
or and um all of this if you don't have

00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:05,039
the right understanding can create

00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,599
friction among open source communities

00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:08,880
among

00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:11,280
companies so it's important to

00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:12,880
educate your community and your team

00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:15,360
about the differences

00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:18,080
and create empathy that will help them

00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:21,199
better collaborate

00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:24,720
because uh we are now working across

00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:27,120
lots of uh lots and lots of time zones

00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,880
in a remote place now more than ever

00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,280
because of the pandemic

00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:32,720
it's important to actively put in place

00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:35,680
better practices

00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:37,120
for enabling asynchronous communication

00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,280
and collaboration

00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,880
and so these are all things that are

00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:45,039
important

00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:48,240
to to create that right environment

00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:50,720
another thing is documentation

00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,479
and here we're talking more about

00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:55,840
community handbooks or

00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:59,840
a company handbook as opposed to

00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:00,639
product documentation at gitlab we have

00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,759
something

00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:05,680
called the handbook first approach which

00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:06,560
basically means that you're supposed to

00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,840
respond

00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:12,240
with a link for everything

00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:13,759
and what this does is that it makes you

00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,720
really think about you know

00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:17,680
okay where is this in the handbook um is

00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:21,120
it up to date

00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:23,680
do i need to create a section and so it

00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,680
um oftentimes documentation gets stales

00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:28,080
and so this handbook first approach

00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,879
really helps to keep the content fresh

00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,840
because you have

00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:32,479
everybody thinking about it because they

00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:35,360
should be

00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:37,360
linking to a section in the handbook

00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:39,120
that explains it

00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,360
and things that go into the handbook or

00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,839
things like values history

00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,480
how different teams operate what tools

00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:48,240
you use

00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:50,480
etc and at getla at gitlab when you use

00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,000
gitlab pages you can also set things

00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,560
like code owners

00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,640
so you can designate certain people to

00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:59,440
be sort of like maintainers

00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:01,040
um in the image to the left i have a

00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,720
picture of that where you can see two

00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,760
people that are the maintainers of that

00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,200
page

00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:07,600
this doesn't mean that they're the ones

00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:10,080
solely responsible for editing the page

00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:12,000
it just means that they're responsible

00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:14,399
for making sure that it's up to date

00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:18,000
and generally helping along with a

00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:20,320
vision of what should be on that page

00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,160
and having something like this really

00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:25,200
enables a remote culture

00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:27,600
because you people from different

00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,880
languages can use translators to help

00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,800
them

00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:32,320
and they can read it at their own pace

00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:35,360
it helps with people

00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:37,279
who might be um you know

00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,360
have vision impairment where they can

00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:42,320
use screen readers etc

00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,839
and and so it can really help you create

00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,600
a more diverse community

00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:47,200
by having all your practices written

00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,279
down

00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:53,120
where if you're interested in this topic

00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:56,080
i invite you to join us at ieeesa

00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,839
open we have a community handbook best

00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:00,080
practices working group

00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:02,640
and i've included the link below in the

00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,640
slides

00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,640
another thing that's really important is

00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,399
onboarding and training

00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,240
and there's lots of different types of

00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,640
onboarding there's things like

00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,680
tools onboarding and subject matter

00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:17,760
onboarding and

00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:19,200
social onboarding and here's an example

00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:22,399
to the left

00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:25,920
is an image of an onboarding template an

00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:27,120
issue template where gitlab when you

00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,519
first on board

00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,959
they have something that every new hire

00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:33,040
needs to go through

00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:34,959
it includes links to the values in the

00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:37,680
history of the org

00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:38,640
video recordings to trainings about the

00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:41,040
tools

00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:43,360
tasks that everyone should complete

00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:45,680
instructions on how to

00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,279
have social onboarding scheduling coffee

00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:50,320
chats and the like

00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:52,079
and tasks that specific teams need to

00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,440
complete like the design team

00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:57,519
engineering team

00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:58,720
engagement etc and so by having git lab

00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:00,880
issues for this

00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:03,360
you can see a place where in open source

00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:05,680
communities you can have this set up for

00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,399
everybody so that they have like a basic

00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,800
knowledge

00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:09,760
coming in and can really find things

00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:13,600
more easily

00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:14,880
in the handbook all right we just have a

00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,600
few minutes left so

00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:18,320
i'm going to go over a few tips and

00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:22,160
tricks

00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:23,440
for non-engineers the first if you don't

00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:26,839
know this one already

00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:29,680
is a must you can create lists with

00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:33,120
tasks and having an asterisk

00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:35,920
and open uh

00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,880
brackets basically makes a check box

00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:40,480
that you can

00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:43,040
use to then map mark tasks as being done

00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:45,360
and we use this a lot at get lab to

00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,000
oftentimes like ask for approval for

00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,000
things

00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,760
because when people check it it records

00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,880
that and has like a specific

00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:55,519
mention of it in the issue

00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,800
another thing that i really like is this

00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:59,920
suggestions in

00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:02,399
code feature because i

00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,760
admitted it earlier on i use google docs

00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:05,680
pretty heavily

00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:07,200
and this is a feature that gets us a

00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:10,480
little bit closer to that

00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:13,040
where if you're using gitlab for your

00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:15,200
for publishing an article for example

00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:17,360
and you want to give feedback

00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,120
this is something similar to how you

00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:22,880
just have a suggested edit

00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:26,160
in another editor and you can insert

00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:28,880
you can add a comment by clicking on

00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:30,800
a little uh looks like a flag icon or

00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:33,360
something comment icon

00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,800
then you click on a button called insert

00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:37,200
suggestion

00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:39,360
and you can add whatever you think

00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,320
whatever you propose is your suggested

00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,800
edit

00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,519
and then it appears in line so that

00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,639
people can

00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:49,680
either approve it or reject it

00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:51,600
and you can comment on it as well so

00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,120
it's a really handy thing that again

00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:57,600
kind of moves us closer to

00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:59,680
the google docs editing functionality

00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,600
another thing because when you're

00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,720
creating software you need to work with

00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:06,639
the entire team

00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:09,279
and designers are a huge part of that um

00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:11,519
in other companies that i've worked the

00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:13,760
design team typically uses

00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:16,320
one tool and then the engineering team

00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:18,880
uses a separate tool

00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,839
and with get lab you can use the single

00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:23,279
tool

00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:26,000
this feature is similar to what envision

00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:27,200
app has i don't know how many people are

00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
familiar with that

00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:31,839
but essentially you can upload designs

00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,639
and then you can click on them to

00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:35,040
comment

00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:36,800
and say for example like this specific

00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:40,079
blue hurts my eyes

00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:41,839
can you please uh change it and that way

00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:44,320
people can have a conversation about

00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:44,800
that specific design and add comments

00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,560
and

00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:49,839
it really helps with the design and

00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,839
iteration process

00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:56,959
and as a program project manager

00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:59,680
like person i love this

00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:00,800
ability to have parent epics child epics

00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:03,120
and issues

00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:04,079
where you can drill down into the

00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:07,199
different child

00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:10,000
epics and you can see things like

00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:10,880
is this task on track is it does it need

00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,079
attention

00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:17,199
is it at risk it's called issue

00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:17,839
health and so you can use that when

00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:20,160
you're

00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:22,720
really keeping track of a large project

00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,120
to better understand how your project is

00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:26,320
doing

00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:30,240
overall we use it a lot for our

00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:32,480
okrs which is objectives and key results

00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:35,120
and it just really helps managers have a

00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:38,320
good view a good understanding of how

00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:40,720
much work is being done each quarter

00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:42,839
we're generally implementing more and

00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,160
more into the project management side of

00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:47,199
gitlab um

00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:48,160
so it's really exciting to see how this

00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:50,240
is progressing

00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:52,079
with a release each month we're moving

00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:55,279
really quickly into

00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:56,880
adding more functionality there

00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:59,360
we're pretty much at times so i just

00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:02,240
want to say that if you want more

00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:04,720
tips and tricks and understanding how

00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:07,760
teams like accounting

00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:11,040
legal design marketing and

00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:14,160
other uh functionalities use git lab

00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:16,720
we're using we're creating a beyond

00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:18,000
code event series in conjunction with

00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:21,120
the women tmrg

00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
group at git lab um where women at get

00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,320
lab will be

00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,519
presenting ways that they use git lab in

00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:27,600
their day jobs

00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:29,199
for all of those previously mentioned

00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,519
departments

00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:32,920
you can check it out and there's a link

00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:36,720
here about

00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:39,360
gitlab.com events and we'll be posting

00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:42,000
details soon

00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,399
last but not least we invite you to join

00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,199
us

00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:46,160
in creating git lab we're an open core

00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:48,800
company with an

00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:50,399
open road map and so we really want to

00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:53,600
hear from the community

00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:55,680
um in order to make the best product for

00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:57,759
all of you

00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:59,519
uh with that i'm just going to leave you

00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:02,399
with some resources

00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:05,199
i will be posting my slides and you can
