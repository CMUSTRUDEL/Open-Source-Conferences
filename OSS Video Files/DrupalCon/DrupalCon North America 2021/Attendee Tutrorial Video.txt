hello and welcome to the drupalcon north

00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:07,759
america 2021

00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:09,440
site tutorial tour um and this

00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:13,040
video will just give you an idea of what

00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:15,759
to expect uh the week of the event

00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:17,760
so uh right now we are in the event and

00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:19,439
we are on the main reception page which

00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,439
is kind of considered the home page or

00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:23,359
the landing page for the event

00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:25,439
um once you're in you will notice that

00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:26,720
you have the event chat here's the left

00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,439
and we've already had a few

00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,240
um speakers come in and say hello so

00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:33,040
this is the

00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:35,040
sitewide event chat so this does not go

00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:36,640
away this stays up there and

00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,879
continues on through the duration of the

00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:41,600
event we also have

00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:42,000
event polls this would be event wide

00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,000
again

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,920
these will be posted by organizers just

00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,840
a fun way to stay engaged

00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,079
one of the nice things you will see is a

00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,239
list of the attendees who have joined

00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:54,640
the event

00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:56,000
in the people section one of my one of

00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,520
the easiest features and the nicest

00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,359
things to do is that when you do find

00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,800
somebody that you'd like to connect with

00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,559
you can go ahead and click on the

00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,680
profile picture and it will give you the

00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:05,760
opportunity

00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:08,880
to invite them to a video call schedule

00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:11,520
a meeting send a message

00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,000
moving over you have the q a tab which

00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,960
is where you

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,640
can ask event organizers a question we

00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,880
will also be manning the

00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,920
zendesk email which has been the

00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,640
information

00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,400
email address that's been used so far

00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,520
but you also have the opportunity to ask

00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,040
here

00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,720
and then you have of course the twitter

00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,439
feed to see what's happening and what's

00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:32,640
being posted

00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:33,439
about the event in real time so if you

00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,720
scroll down

00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:38,240
um you will see uh your event schedule

00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,920
there are a few ways to visit the

00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,840
sessions and visit

00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,159
things that are happening uh what's

00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,320
happening now will always appear here

00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,079
you will also have the navigation tabs

00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,079
um over to the left or the navigation

00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:52,640
menu here to the left that will also

00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:54,159
take you to where you want to go so we

00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,759
have the just in the event description

00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:56,719
and key housekeeping notes here feel

00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:58,640
free to

00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:00,719
um we do suggest checking in here for

00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,560
updates throughout the event

00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:04,799
and then below you do have the event

00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:07,840
schedule what's nice is that you can

00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:10,080
uh use the schedule here to

00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,200
add things to your calendar and build

00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,959
out your week

00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:15,040
so we said that there were a few ways to

00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,720
access a session um you do have

00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,480
visit sessions you'll say visit

00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,319
something on the stage visit something

00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,080
in the expo hall that will all appear

00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:23,680
here you can certainly click there

00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,680
but you can also use these tabs as we

00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,560
mentioned before the stage is open at

00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,879
all times

00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,000
so you will have um in clicking in open

00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:33,680
to the stage

00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,440
how you do see what there will be a feed

00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:38,160
or not a feed you'll be joining on the

00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:41,360
session as it's going at the moment

00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:44,800
and then you also have stage exclusive

00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:46,640
chat polling and q a opportunities

00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,400
um and as the stage is a function that

00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,599
stays open throughout the duration of

00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:53,599
the conference

00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:55,840
the chat will stay up the entire time

00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:57,680
scrolling to uh next to the sessions

00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,280
again from the main page you can click

00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,879
over to the sessions but you also have

00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,239
the ability to click here

00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:04,640
and this will show you what's live at

00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:07,760
the moment we have several options

00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:09,920

00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:14,000
visit this year's hallway track so the

00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:16,000
hallway track is for impromptu

00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,760

00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,840
at a time

00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,159
they're just here to encourage

00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,400
conversation

00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:36,159
encouraged networking as we said so by

00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,680
clicking this button here to share your

00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:41,760
audio and video

00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:44,400
you will be asked to um just approve

00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:47,200
for the proper allowances and then once

00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,560

00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,040
many people are on screen with you

00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:55,200
obviously um but then also just how many

00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:57,360
spaces are being taken up so right now

00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,200
there are six spaces i'm using one

00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,280
um if i were to share my screen that

00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,720
actually counts as a person as well

00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,560
but it's just a nice way to see what's

00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,319
going on we also have other attendees

00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,920

make sure that we show you everything um

00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,040
appropriately so

00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,639
here we go so we do have a little bit of

00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,000
information down below this is

00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:31,680
part of the session capability and

00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,240
you'll see this in the sessions

00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,919
uh this is again capped at six people at

00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,720
a time and it's a shared public space

00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:38,560
with the event

00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,880
so the hallway tracks will stay open the

00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:44,160
entire time so the chat

00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:45,520
polling people q a will be up so once

00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,639
you leave the room just know that

00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:49,759
anything in the chat

00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:51,440
um will not um will not go away um and

00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:55,120
that these hallway track sessions

00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:58,720
are um being recorded

00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:00,160
saying that um and code of conduct still

00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,720
applies

00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,400
so within the sessions um if we go back

00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,199
to the sessions

00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,520
i'm going to leave this broadcast um you

00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,360
do

00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:14,000
the sharing is similar the sharing

00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:14,000
camera opportunity is quite similar

00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,160
okay so back to the live session module

00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,759
um

00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,680
modules what you'll see here in the

00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:24,400
agenda for the sessions um

00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,000
is a live session here it is moderated

00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,680
so i'm going to click in

00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,080
and the reason we want to show you this

00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,520
is that within sessions you do have the

00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,600
opportunity to ask

00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:35,600
to share your audio and video so if you

00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,080
want to do that what you can do is just

00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,440
click

00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,120
or if there's a time for questions

00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,479
similar to before it will ask you for

00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,160
the same permissions

00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:43,919
and you'll click and what you'll see is

00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,280
that i'm waiting for approval

00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:47,520
so what that means is that these

00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,720
speakers and the moderators do have the

00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:51,199
ability to

00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,520
accept people onto stage um so thanks

00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:55,280
for letting me join michelle

00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:59,280
and they can ask you to leave or remove

00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:59,280
you from the stage um when they're ready

00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,560
okay um so below the session one key

00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,880
thing

00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,240
is there will be a session survey linked

00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:09,199
down here during the event

00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,720
we do ask that you um give feedback to

00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,240
our speakers and so that information

00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,759
will always be down here and there will

00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,560
be exclusive links for each

00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:18,720
session within the session similar to

00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,880
the stage you do have your own chat

00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:23,039
um so you do have an event chat again

00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,560
that is wide but using um

00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:26,560
conference wide but using the session

00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,639
tab you'll be able to click through

00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,800
and do session exclusive chat polling

00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,880
and q and a

00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,880
one of the next features um if you're

00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:37,120
new to hop in that's a lot of fun

00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:39,440
is our networking module and so within

00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,319
networking um it's kind of a networking

00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,400
roulette

00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:43,840
so what you do is if you're ready to

00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,639

allow my permissions again

00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,000
and it is going to match me with

00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,840
somebody else who happens to be in the

00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,520
networking session module

00:06:53,840 --> 00:07:00,319
um let's try that again here we go

00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,720
and so i'm meeting michelle um and this

00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,720
is

00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,479
randomized um so if there are a lot of

00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:07,599

00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:09,120

00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,199
countdown timer counting down from three

00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,080
minutes from the second that you're

00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:21,360

00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,680
um and then what you will have the

00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,240
opportunity to do after um when there's

00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,160

all right so as you can see the expo

00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:46,560
hall has boost from a bunch of our

00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,479
various sponsors

00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,919

00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:51,759
all of the different

00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:54,240
booths and whatnot that these

00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:56,560
individuals have built out for you

00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,680
we're gonna go into media current

00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,520
actually

00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,800

00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,400
here melissa thank you

00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,240
so when you're inside the booth that you

00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,919
will see if they are not live most

00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,680
likely they will have some videos

00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:09,360
up on the screen for you to watch if you

00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,120
go up to the top corner where it says

00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,479
one of 17

00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,319
that actually means that they have a

00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:16,000
whole playlist full of youtube videos

00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:17,599
that you can watch so you can kind of go

00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,199
through all that watch the ones that you

00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:20,879
want at your own leisure

00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:23,599
and enjoy the information that they're

00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:25,039
providing if you look over to the right

00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:26,800
side as well you'll see

00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:28,479
similar to how all the sessions and the

00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,840
reception page has

00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:31,840
you've got kind of all the different

00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:34,399
chat polls people q

00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:36,159
a all of the various information that

00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:37,200
you see on everything else but the one

00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:39,519
key difference here

00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,200
is the offer tab so this is another

00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,399
location where they can give you some

00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,279
further information

00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:46,320
about their company details and any kind

00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:48,880
of offer that they have

00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,080
exclusive to the conference itself if

00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,480
you also go down

00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,600
you'll see another button that may vary

00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,440
what it says

00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,880
but it is a button on the offer page

00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,760
that you can click

00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,160
to either get more information let the

00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,360
booth

00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:05,440
staff know that you're requesting more

00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,360
content from them and they will get an

00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,200
email with your information and they can

00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:12,000
then reach out to you specifically

00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,720
to kind of follow up on your request if

00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,120
you scroll

00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:17,040
down to or this booth might not have it

00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,560
i apologize but if you do scroll down

00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,160
some booths may have some additional

00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:23,600
information that populates

00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:24,800
underneath the videos that are showing

00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,800
there and that might have some

00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:28,880
additional images or links just depends

00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,240
on how the booth staff themselves have

00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:33,279
kind of flushed out their

00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:35,200
booth specifically so if you enter into

00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:37,120
the booth and is during live expo hauls

00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,440
you'll see similar to the sessions

00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:41,360
where you can ask to share and kind of

00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,560
join your video and you should see at

00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,320
that time too

00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,160
the booth staff kind of sitting in the

00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,160
booth doing a presentation

00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:50,080
so you'll see that option for you to

00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,880
kind of join and engage with them in

00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,720
face to face

00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,080
similar to if you're alive in person how

00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,560
you kind of walk into a booth and be

00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:58,560
able to chat with that booth staff

00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:00,720
that is the expo hall we hope you enjoy

00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,600
kind of perusing through and visiting

00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,720
all of the

00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,920
individual sponsors and that is the site

00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,079
itself we hope

00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:09,760
