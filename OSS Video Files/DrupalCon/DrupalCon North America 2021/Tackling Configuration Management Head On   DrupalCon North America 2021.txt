	00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:06,560
all right

00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:09,519
uh i think it's time to get started

00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:11,280
um my name is rolando scott and we're

00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:12,480
going to be tackling configuration

00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,839
management

00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:19,119
head on today um

00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:22,400
i i chose this topic and it's a

00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:24,000
it's a bit of an important topic because

00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:27,519
i feel a lot of people don't

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,279
really know um or have issues with

00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:30,640
configuration it's one of those things

00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:33,280
that it's sometimes a

00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,239
second nature thing for developers but

00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,399
as we've seen

00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:38,000
uh it's not always developers that are

00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:40,000
working on sites right we have site

00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,800
builders we have clients we have

00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,079
a bunch of other people that touch sites

00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,920
and have no idea

00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:48,000
of what configuration is or what

00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,079
configuration management does

00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,440
and then we start running into issues

00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:53,520
right but before

00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,800
we begin uh let me talk a little bit

00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,559
about myself

00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,239
like i said i'm rolando scott i'm

00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:59,840
currently the director of drupal

00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:03,199
development at coyote

00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:06,320
i oversee around 35

00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:07,520
i think right now amazing the drupal

00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,479
developers

00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:12,720
i've been around drupal since triple six

00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:13,520
and like i was saying i am currently

00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,720
based off

00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:19,040
uh san jose costa rica um so it's

00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:20,880
it's a pleasure and an honor to be here

00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,080
uh with you guys in presenting this

00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,479
topic

00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,720
um like i said uh this session is

00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:28,400
directed to developers but also

00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,159
to project managers and basically

00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,240
anybody who interacts with the admin

00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:34,640
interface of drupal right

00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:37,200
and while most of what i'm saying does

00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:39,360
apply to drupal 9

00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,119
i did this presentation thing uh

00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,880
thinking about triple h so there might

00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:43,439
be a couple of small things here and

00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,280
there

00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:47,119
that might change in drupal 9 but for

00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,960
the most part it's it's basically the

00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:51,920
same

00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,920
so again

00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,159
configuration management right why why

00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,000
right um

00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,280
we see it all the time we see it when

00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
when clients

00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,360
um or when the project manager does a

00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,200
change on the site

00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,479
and then somebody does a deployment and

00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,200
it gets wiped out

00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:10,640
or somebody synchronizes configuration

00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,760
and they didn't see there were other

00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:13,680
changes there

00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,599
and it's one of those nice and fun

00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,160
drupal things where you press a button

00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:20,319
and it's gone forever unless you had it

00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:22,640
on the repo somehow

00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:24,239
to be honest uh when i when i see and

00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,599
hear people struggling with keeping

00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:26,640
several environments up to date of

00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:28,480
synchronized

00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,160
i always imagine one of those cheesy

00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,800
infomercials like you guys know the ones

00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,239
right like

00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,400
do you need help keeping your

00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:36,319
configuration in check

00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,080
why do you think why do things keep

00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:41,040
breaking when i do diplomas

00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,480
is there even any help for me that's

00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,360
what i always think of when i when i

00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,080
when i see this

00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,160
um but the good news is there is there

00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,560
is there is a lot

00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:51,360
of help out there and um i'm here to

00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,519
show you how

00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,720
easy it is to basically keep your

00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:57,200
configuration in check

00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,920
so let's start off by just saying what

00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,360
is

00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,440
configuration management right

00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,959
configuration management is a collection

00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:05,280
of admin settings

00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:07,280
that determine how the site functions as

00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:10,000
opposed to the content of the site

00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,680
so configuration will typically include

00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,239
things such as the site name

00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:17,120
the content types fields taxonomy

00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:20,319
vocabularies views and so on right

00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:22,159
um configuration management allows you

00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:23,920
to synchronize configuration between

00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:27,120
different instances of the same

00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:29,040
drupal site so for example if i have a

00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,840
dev environment and i have a live

00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:33,200
environment

00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,840
right i can test things on the dev

00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,879
environment

00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,640
and i am with uh with 100

00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:40,480
confidence knowing that if it works on

00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,760
the dev environment it'll work on the

00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,400
live environment right

00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:47,040
and it's also configuration is actually

00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:49,360
a set of files that can be saved

00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:52,080
and maintained by the repo or version

00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:55,360
control of your choice

00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:57,599
um let's start off by

00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,879
the number one question is what is a

00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:02,400
configuration change

00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:05,760
what are what are changes that um

00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:08,239
that trigger a configuration change so

00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,200
let's talk about the easy ones right any

00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:11,680
content type

00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:13,360
any fields any change made on the

00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,519
configuration screen

00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,799
of the the admin section or the admin

00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:20,000
config

00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:20,320
web forms views display modes those are

00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,120
all

00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,680
easy ones that when you change uh make a

00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,720
change

00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:29,360
add the lead do anything to those

00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,720
then a new configuration file uh is

00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,680
changed right

00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,400
um the easy ones there aren't as any

00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,960
content

00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,240
that's added as a content type any web

00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:41,600
form submission

00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,080
any files or any sort of media and many

00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,040
links

00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:47,280
uh the the menu itself is part of

00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:50,080
configuration but the menu links aren't

00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:51,440
right but now we start seeing where it

00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:54,160
gets if you write so

00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:56,000
again the cellulite vocabularies are

00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,720
configuration but the taxonomy

00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,400
terms are not and this sometimes creates

00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,880
issues on sites that use

00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,240
taxonomy terms as structural building

00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,759
blocks instead of just ways to

00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,759
categorize content like

00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:09,120
i don't know most people understand that

00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:11,919
a taxonomy term

00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,440
is an entity like other group entities

00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:14,720
and it can have fields it can have

00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:18,400
display modes

00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:20,880
um so you could basically build a page

00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,000
off your taxonomy term right but what

00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,639
happens when you

00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,320
when you built this page on dev of this

00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,240
based on the taxonomy term

00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,520
and then you have other functionality

00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,440
built into it

00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,639
when you push the configuration to

00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:35,600
another environment

00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:38,479
that term doesn't exist necessarily so

00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:41,039
it might bring some issues right um

00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:42,400
the other uh part where it gets iffy and

00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:44,880
i think you guys just

00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,680
noticed that in the chat is that the

00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,560
when you

00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,080
push up a block the block settings the

00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,160
settings of a block

00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,840
are configuration but the actual block

00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:56,080
content is not

00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:58,240
so basically when we push this

00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:00,160
configuration up to another environment

00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,280
we're telling drupal hey here there's

00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,680
this block

00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:05,199
here's the settings for it and this is

00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,000
the reference but that reference of the

00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:09,759
content doesn't

00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:12,560
exist so we end up getting this nice um

00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,919
issue error message um saying that the

00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,800
content is missing or

00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:17,919
you know you need to fix it um so yeah

00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,199
it's definitely

00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:21,360
these are the parts where it gets kind

00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:23,440
of iffy right

00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,720
uh i will say that back in the good old

00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:27,919
days and i say that

00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:30,800
a little bit sarcastically in drupal 7

00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:32,319
we used to use a module called features

00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,479
i don't know if anybody's used it but

00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:35,840
features is not the same as

00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:38,960
configuration management

00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:40,960
you could um basically select

00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,240
what you wanted it doesn't it didn't

00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,840
have to be the whole site you could

00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,080
select certain fields

00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,840
certain configuration and you could

00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,160
export that in a way that could it could

00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,000
be

00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,000
it could be imported into another site

00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
now one of the main differences

00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,080
is that it didn't have to be the same

00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,560
site it could be a completely different

00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,880
site

00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,840
for example if you if you created a blog

00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,080
content type

00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:04,000
with a couple of fields you could export

00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:06,880
that and then you could import it

00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,840
um features is available for drupal a

00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,240
and drupal 9

00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,440
um i think i want to say triple a for

00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,120
sure

00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:16,639
but it's not the same as configuration

00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:18,319
management right

00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:20,240
all right so let's talk about what's in

00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:23,520
a configuration file right

00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:26,720
uh in a configuration file you

00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:29,280
it's a yaml file right um so

00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,080
it has a universal uh universally i'm

00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:33,520
sorry unique

00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:36,400
id it has languages statuses

00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:39,280
uh weights dependencies it basically is

00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:41,759
a file that drupal reads and says okay

00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:43,280
so i have to create this content type

00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,680
this content type has

00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,879
this field it has this name it has this

00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,879
label

00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:51,280
should i show the label should i show

00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:51,599
this should i create an automatic url

00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:55,599
when

00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:56,560
it's safe all these options are saved

00:07:55,599 --> 00:08:01,440
into this

00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:01,440
one file and is read by drupal

00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,039
when you are installing a new module if

00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,759
i don't know if you've actually gone

00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:10,560
into

00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:12,240
a module folder and see the files a lot

00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,960
of these contrib modules

00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:17,039
actually include configuration files uh

00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:18,479
for the initial setup right so when you

00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:20,560
install the module

00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:22,479
that file gets copied over and you have

00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:25,360
like a base starting point

00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:27,280
of the module afterwards any change that

00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,160
you do to the configuration of that

00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:31,440
module

00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:33,279
uh its own it's it's saved as part of

00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,839
your configuration and it's owned by the

00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,680
site

00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,680
and not by the module that's also

00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:39,519
important

00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:41,039
um so let's talk about workflows right

00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,000
there's there's two ways there's two

00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:46,560
main ways

00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:48,240
of um of synchronizing and working with

00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:51,360
configuration management right

00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:53,120
the first option is using the ui so we

00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:55,440
have an overview page

00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,040
at that address right admin config

00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,880
development configuration

00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:01,200
it tells us a bunch of different things

00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,800
it can tell us if our configuration is

00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,760
in sync with what's currently in the

00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,920
files right

00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,800
if i go into this site and i make a

00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,640
change

00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,160
it will alert me that there's a

00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,720
difference right between what's

00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,120
currently

00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,160
on the site and what's on the on the

00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:17,519
files right

00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:19,040
and it allows me to also import all and

00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,880
basically grab everything the

00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:22,640
configuration that's saved on the files

00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:26,640
and apply it to the site

00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:29,839
so um it's it's it's an easy way to

00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:32,800
basically if you move the files over um

00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:33,600
maybe you know using git or some sort of

00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,760
other

00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,600
way it's an easy way to synchronize the

00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:39,600
files and it tells you

00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,519
it can tell you literally what the

00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,760
changes are and

00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:45,760
what it's going to affect one of the fun

00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,360
things about this is that there is no

00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:50,320
back button of this

00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,440
so if you've made a bunch of changes and

00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,440
you synchronize

00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,640
and you import the synchronization i'm

00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,959
sorry if you import the

00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:58,399
the new configuration there's no going

00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:00,160
back to this unless you have some sort

00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:02,320
of backup or some some

00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:05,440
of other way of recovering the the

00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:08,240
changes you had made

00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,680
using the ui you could also export the

00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,680
whole configuration so if you for

00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,959
example have a dev environment and have

00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,720
a live environment

00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:17,120
you can do all the changes in the dev

00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,480
environment go to the export page it'll

00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,480
give you one

00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,760
compressed file and then you can go to

00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,560
the import page of the

00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,120
live environment import it and it'll

00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,560
sync

00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,640
correctly with all the changes that you

00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,680
didn't have right there's also the

00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:32,880
option of seeing

00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:35,600
one single file instead of the whole

00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,880
um you know configuration view then if

00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,120
you see the single file

00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:40,480
it'll show you what the file looks like

00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,440
on the screen then you can copy and

00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,519
paste it

00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,519
and use whatever you want the other

00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:46,079
workflow is using brush right for those

00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:50,399
who

00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:53,440
might not know drush is a command line

00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:55,519
tool that does

00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:57,519
a bunch of things in drupal but among

00:10:55,519 --> 00:11:00,480
the many things it does

00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:01,040
it it helps with configuration so

00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,440
there's a

00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:05,680
rush command to export the configuration

00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:07,680
there's a dress command to import it

00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,120
and when you run it it'll tell you

00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:12,000
exactly what

00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,880
um configuration file is being changed

00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,959
and

00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,959
what uh you know what's being if it's

00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:18,640
being created if it's being updated or

00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:21,760
if it's being deleted right

00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:23,600
it no longer exists so um

00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:25,360
you know brush is that the easy way for

00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:28,320
developers to use so

00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:30,000
uh at te ori we have this workflow right

00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,720
this is how we normally

00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,519
approach configuration right we all of

00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:37,040
our devs

00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:38,560
uh develop locally right on on their own

00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,480
computers right

00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:42,000
once they're done doing the changes they

00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,560
export the configuration via

00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,399
brush like we just saw they'll commit

00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:50,480
and push this configuration

00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:52,320
uh up to the repo we use circle ci as

00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:55,040
our contiguous integration tool

00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:57,519
that grabs that repo and imports

00:11:55,040 --> 00:12:00,639
rebuilds the dev environment

00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:02,639
where we mostly host on pantheon and

00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:06,480
imports the configuration automatically

00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:10,079
so that is the way we make sure that dev

00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:11,920
is always in sync and has the latest

00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:14,079
configuration applied to it right

00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,519
because it's not like if you push the

00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:16,560
configuration files

00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:18,320
that doesn't mean that they're

00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,519
synchronized yet right they're there but

00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,320
they're not synchronized

00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:23,519
using a a continuous integration tool

00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,279
like circle ci

00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:26,720
we can make sure that it's not something

00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:29,120
oh i forgot right

00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,720
it automatically does it for you right

00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:33,200
and one of the most important things is

00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:37,040
that we stash the configuration

00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:37,519
um files one level underneath the web

00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,920
folder

00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:40,880
it's just uh best practices to not have

00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:43,680
those files

00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:44,639
be accessible via a browser and you can

00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:48,000
configure

00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:48,000
this in the settings file

00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:53,120
all right so some things to consider

00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:55,040
right um you know one of the common

00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,800
issues that we see is when changes are

00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:59,440
made directly to different environments

00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:02,560
without exporting the code right

00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,120
this happens a lot you know somebody

00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,480
goes in

00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:07,440
and makes a change on the live

00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:09,839
environment of a site and

00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:12,079
and those settings never get exported

00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:13,839
and put into the repo so eventually

00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:15,440
when somebody is synchronizing code

00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:17,600
it'll wipe it out it'll

00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:19,360
completely reverse all the changes that

00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:22,480
you have done

00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,920
or another uh issue that we see is the

00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,880
configuration is actually never

00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,399
synchronized

00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,000
so the different instances are not

00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:30,720
consistent uh

00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,440
quick story we've we had a humongous

00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,560
site

00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:37,519
um a client came to us with their very

00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:39,120
big site that is hosted on aquaria and

00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:40,240
their previous developers they told us

00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,680
that the issues they had with the

00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,360
previous developers

00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,800
is that sometimes you know they they

00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:47,120
would push a new feature

00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,160
and it would work on them and they would

00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,760
kind of work on

00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,600
untest and then it would kind of work

00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:54,000
differently on the live site

00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,760
and you know so on and so on and we took

00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,639
a look at the site it was because they

00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:59,680
had never

00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:02,079
never ever uh synchronized configuration

00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:04,480
so that meant that those developers were

00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:07,760
literally

00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:10,000
pushing code on dev then

00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:12,000
recreating the same functionality

00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,399
manually on test environment and then

00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,880
recreating the same functionality again

00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:17,600
on the live environment um and i mean

00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:20,160
that

00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,959
that gets super messy really fast right

00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,440
because

00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:24,720
you have to do exactly the same things

00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,720
over and over again

00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,480
um which is obviously not the way but

00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,320
it's something that we do see sometimes

00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:33,920
when configuration isn't used

00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:34,720
at all so this is what you shouldn't do

00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:38,720
right

00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:41,600
um you should avoid making configuration

00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:43,440
configuration changes on a live drupal

00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:46,240
site right this is what we shouldn't

00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:47,279
do but also we do have to acknowledge

00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,360
right that clients

00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:50,880
are clients and they will make changes

00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,720
because at the end of the day it is

00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:54,320
their site right and they maybe

00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,760
are not knowledgeable enough to know

00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:59,040
that they have to go

00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:00,240
uh through the repo or that they do is

00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,519
you know that there's different ways

00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,399
they they don't know they're just trying

00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:04,720
to make their site

00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:06,560
look better or work better right and it

00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,120
is their site so they should have access

00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:10,560
to that

00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:13,279
and to it so what we do is

00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:14,320
um when we're about to push something to

00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:16,959
production

00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:18,720
uh we go into production first and look

00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:20,079
at that configuration screen right we

00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:23,199
look at that screen

00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:26,800
and see if the client has actually

00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:28,639
made any change first uh we try to

00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:31,680
understand what those changes are

00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:34,480
um if there's um

00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:35,279
if there's a way to to basically copy

00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:38,160
that change

00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:39,920
back uh manually or do we need to export

00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,959
that configuration from the live site

00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:43,519
and synchronize it

00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:45,839
with with ours but basically take a look

00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:47,279
at what's on the live site before we

00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:48,800
push the production right

00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:50,560
because we don't want two things to

00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:52,480
happen either we just push the

00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:54,959
production and synchronize

00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,480
uh our changes and then we wipe out

00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:58,880
everything the client has done

00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,160
or even worse uh well i think that's the

00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:02,160
worst part but

00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:04,320
the another issue that could occur is

00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:06,560
that you you push to production without

00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:09,360
knowing and when you go to the

00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:11,120
configuration synchronization page you

00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,800
realize that there's other changes

00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,240
and they might not be compatible with

00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,079
what you're pushing up

00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,680
and then now you're in the pic because

00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:19,199
you can't really synchronize your

00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,079
changes without destroying something

00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:23,199
else

00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:25,199
and it just gets really messy so uh

00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:26,639
always make sure to look at the live

00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:30,079
site before you

00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:32,160
push anything um to production

00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:33,279
uh and you guys know where to look for

00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,880
it now um

00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:37,519
another thing that you shouldn't do is

00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:40,240
making changes to the files directly

00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:40,720
you can it's not the end of the world uh

00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,800
but

00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,720
dml files have a specific you know

00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:46,800
formatting and spacing

00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,639
and a bunch of other things and it's

00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,759
really easy to mess up a configuration

00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:51,680
file if you

00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:53,519
edit it directly so it's always better

00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:55,600
to just do the change

00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:56,639
that you want on your website and then

00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:00,000
export it and

00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:02,320
you're good to go um i won't dive

00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,559
deep into this because this could be a

00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:07,439
whole different session but

00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:08,400
the main three hosting providers uh have

00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:12,319
different ways

00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:15,039
of managing the configuration files

00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:16,400
i know aqua has like two versions of it

00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:18,079
pantheon is a little bit more

00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:21,600
straightforward it only has one

00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:23,199
version of it uh but yeah it's depending

00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:25,919
on where you are

00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:27,199
and what you're doing um and where

00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:29,600
you're hosting i'm sorry

00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:31,440
um it's important to take note and read

00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,720
the documentation of each hosting

00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:36,080
provider to know

00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:37,919
how it works for them right um

00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,760
one of the amazing things that drupal

00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:40,640
has right and and this applies to

00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,880
basically any

00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:45,200
subject is the contributors right and

00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:48,720
configuration management is no

00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:50,720
different uh from that so um

00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,240
there are a couple of modules and of

00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,520
course this list is a lot bigger but i'm

00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:55,440
just going to quickly talk about

00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:57,039
some of these that extend the

00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:00,480
functionality of

00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:03,280
configuration management one of the

00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:05,120
the the ones i like the most but it is

00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,480
kind of evil but because of the reason

00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:09,039
we just talked about

00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:10,960
is configuration read only what that

00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:12,880
does if you install this module it

00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:16,799
doesn't allow the client

00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:19,919
or anybody to do any change on your site

00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:21,120
that triggers a configuration change so

00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:24,480
basically

00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:26,080
um the what can be done on the site is

00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:28,240
just adding content right

00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:29,120
but again at the end of the day the the

00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,760
client site

00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,640
is the client site right so using this

00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:35,919
module

00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,400
is i think for developers is a little

00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:38,480
bit

00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,760
like yes hopefully we could use it but

00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,440
for the client you know

00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:43,440
maybe they want to add another web form

00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,559
maybe they want to add another taxonomy

00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,320
vocabulary

00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:48,320
you know with this module installed they

00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:49,520
wouldn't be able to but at the same time

00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:52,799
you would make sure they wouldn't be

00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:54,840
able to break their site right

00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:56,000
i know there's different opinions on it

00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:59,120
um

00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,600
configuration split is another good one

00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:02,960
where you depending on the environment

00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:06,400
you can have it

00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:08,400
run certain um configuration certain

00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:10,240
configurations on one environment

00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,760
different than the other ones and a

00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:15,039
normal use case of this

00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:18,640
is um google um

00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:21,520
yeah uh well google ads and also

00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:22,160
um you know anything that we don't want

00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,799
running

00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:27,039
on them for example because we don't

00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:28,320
want the impressions for google ads to

00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:30,799
come out on dev

00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:32,960
um because it throws an erroneous number

00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:34,559
but we actually do want that to work on

00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:38,480
the live site right so

00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:39,919
um stuff like that um recreate block

00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:43,760
content is a module

00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:45,919
that basically allows uh the content

00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:47,280
of the block to be part of the

00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:49,760
configuration so when

00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:51,600
you push the configuration of a block it

00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:53,039
carries the content and you don't get

00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:55,120
that error message that you

00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:56,640
that we saw before which is very

00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:59,679
important right

00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:01,760
so that is one thing uh configuration

00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:03,280
ignore is one of my favorites we use it

00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:06,080
a lot on

00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:07,919
on our sites so for example on our local

00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:10,480
environments are on dev

00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:12,000
um all the performance options are

00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:15,120
turned off there's no caching

00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:17,280
we're not aggregating css or js

00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:19,600
but on the live site it's always turned

00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:23,120
on so no matter if somebody

00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:25,280
by mistakes um pushes

00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:26,960
that configuration about you know

00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:29,679
turning off caching and stuff on the

00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:32,320
live site it's never going to turn off

00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:33,360
when we synchronize because it's being

00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,919
ignored

00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:36,799
um the other one configuration menu link

00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:39,760
uh

00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:41,520
carries configuration carries the menus

00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:44,159
along with the configuration of the

00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:46,320
of the menu so you not only push the

00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:48,240
menu but you also push the links up

00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:50,720
and then structure structuresync is a

00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:52,480
massive module that allows you to carry

00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:54,720
a bunch of different content like

00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:57,440
taxonomy terms like menu items

00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,240
so when you push the configuration of

00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:01,120
the

00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:02,960
of the taxonomy vocabulary for example

00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,600
it automatically pushes the terms as

00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:07,039
well

00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:09,679
um i've had mixed um

00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:11,440
you know mixed results with structure

00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:13,840
sync it sometimes

00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:15,039
creates a little bit more issues but

00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,799
yeah it's great for

00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:19,679
uh it's also great for blocks that is

00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:22,159
correct uh thank you greg

00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:23,280
so some key takeaways from from today

00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:25,520
right so

00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:26,640
configuration management is a great

00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:29,200
thing to have right

00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,840
it's a must use if your sites have more

00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,679
than one

00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:33,360
instance which should always almost be

00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:35,280
the case right but i know there are some

00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:37,440
drupal sites that exist out there

00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:39,200
that are just that site uh but you know

00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,640
for professional development you should

00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,919
always have more than one instance of

00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:45,280
the site

00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:47,280
um and now we understand you know how to

00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:48,640
import it how to export it and why

00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:51,520
changes get worked out

00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:52,559
and how to avoid it right um you don't

00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:54,240
have to fear it

00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:56,480
you just have to understand it like

00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:59,039
mostly everything we do

00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:59,760
and now that you know you know what

00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:02,799
changes

00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:04,799
that you do uh create a configuration

00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:06,799
change now you can if you're a project

00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:08,480
manager that's going in there and

00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:10,240
changing certain things you can let your

00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:12,240
your fellow developer know hey i changed

00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:14,400
this let's be on the lookout if you're a

00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:17,679
developer you know when you need to

00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:19,520
export configuration and um and you know

00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:21,440
any anybody else that touches the site

00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:24,080
they kind of understand

00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:26,000
when and a configuration file is created

00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:29,120
and when it's not

00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:32,480
um great so

00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:33,919
now is the time for questions i think we

00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:36,000
have a few

00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:37,600
uh yes i am going to make the slides

00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:41,280
available as soon as the

00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:43,520
as the session is over

00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:44,960
let's go through the questions i think

00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:48,640
that

00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:50,640
uh what is let's see elaine

00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,840
asked what's your strategy for managing

00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:54,240
blocks

00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:55,679
um yep there is modules that help for

00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:58,000
that uh

00:22:55,679 --> 00:23:00,480
uh we try to not install a lot of

00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:03,440
modules uh unnecessary modules

00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:04,320
so what we do uh when we're building out

00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:07,600
a site

00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:08,320
is we create the block in the highest

00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,000
environment

00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:11,760
available for example if we have the

00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,559
test environment and dev environment the

00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,960
locals

00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:15,840
if you create the block in the test

00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,080
environment

00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:19,360
and then pull down that configuration to

00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,360
the dev environment

00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:22,559
and make sure that when developers are

00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,640
grabbing uh

00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:26,320
the site for their development to to

00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,440
grab like the database and the current

00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:29,679
configuration

00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,880
then that works that that means that

00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:32,880
whenever you push up

00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,000
all the configuration for that block is

00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,840
already in sync

00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,000
and it won't get be destroyed that's one

00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:40,000
of the the ways i prefer it

00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,120
uh but again there are modules that you

00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,799
know that help

00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:46,880
serve this um do you use

00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:48,720
uh enrique is asking to use

00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,720
configuration split if so do you

00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:52,240
recommend any particular strategy as in

00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:54,480
what splits do you usually create

00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:55,520
environmental splits functionality yeah

00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:58,799
so yeah um

00:23:55,520 --> 00:24:01,919
i i think basically we we split

00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:02,559
things um we do a combination of

00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:05,760
splitting

00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:09,039
and ignoring right to me splitting is

00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:11,600
things that are like functional that are

00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:12,880
client related most of the times that we

00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:15,520
don't want

00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:16,840
um impressions on the dev site we don't

00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:19,840
want

00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:21,600
um you know analytics google analytics

00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:23,360
is a big one we don't want google

00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:25,360
analytics uh

00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:26,480
to be shown on dev and on test

00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:29,200
environments

00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:30,720
um just so they don't get uh visits from

00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,000
you know devs from different parts of

00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:34,799
the country

00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:37,039
or the world so that's when i use

00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:39,520
configurations but in configuration

00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:40,720
ignore is for functional things like i

00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:44,000
just mentioned

00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:45,360
to me configuration ignores is uh for

00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,960
example

00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:53,039
on dev having uh the update module

00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:55,520
um installed but on

00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:56,159
on the on the live environment not

00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:58,320
having it

00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:00,400
installed you know or or like i

00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,919
mentioned the performance ones

00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:05,360
you know stuff like that that's what we

00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:06,960
use configuration ignore for

00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:08,640
ryan what is the best way to handle

00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,080
removing modules from your production

00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,880
site environment like in terms of

00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:13,039
workflow

00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:14,720
we have issues with database errors upon

00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:16,080
configuration sync when the module is

00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:19,440
removed yes

00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:22,799
um that's it that's a great question

00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:24,720
uh as as the answer i'm sorry it's

00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:26,159
looking a little fuzzy here there we go

00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:29,120
um

00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:29,520
you know if you you can remove a module

00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,679
from

00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:33,520
a production environment right um and

00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:35,679
it'll it'll it should work it should be

00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:37,679
able to remove the module um i think the

00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:40,320
most important thing to do is

00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:42,159
when you go back and are about to push

00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:43,360
code to the live environment you also

00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:45,120
remove the module

00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:46,480
there right so when the configuration

00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:49,120
that's being pushed

00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:50,000
up to the production environment already

00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:52,240
includes

00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,880
removing that module so you won't have

00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:56,720
any issues

00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:59,039
because of it because if you don't what

00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:00,240
happens is that the configuration that

00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:01,919
you're pushing up

00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,760
includes that module right and it's

00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:06,080
going to try to reinstall it again

00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:08,080
and that's where the issues uh become

00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:10,320
sorry start happening right because

00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:11,919
now you know maybe you deleted some

00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:13,600
other things that were related to that

00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:14,240
module and now it needs it again and

00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:17,120
yeah

00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:18,400
so make sure that you can remove the

00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,279
module from your production site

00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:22,400
environment

00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:24,559
but it's always best to go back and in

00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:26,559
dev or in your local remove that module

00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:29,120
again and push that configuration up

00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:31,760
so it doesn't get reinstalled again when

00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,760
you're pushing up

00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:36,240
anthony asks as a person coming from

00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:37,760
drupal 7 what is the difference between

00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:39,360
configuration manager

00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:41,200
and features as i see it they both

00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:43,679
manage your site configurations

00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:45,520
and settings or am i missing something

00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:48,400
sure

00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:49,760
so i think you guys have kind of already

00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:53,120
talked about it in the chat

00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:56,880
but when you use features

00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:58,480
features can be used uh to not only do

00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:00,080
like you can you can select what

00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:03,279
features you want right there

00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:07,440
there's definitely um some features

00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:09,360
that um that you might want like i gave

00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,880
the example of a specific like if i'm

00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:12,799
making a blog and i have a couple of

00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:15,279
fields and i want to push that up

00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:15,279
um

00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,720
with configuration management it's the

00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:23,440
whole site it's basically everything

00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:24,240
in configuration and also one thing uh

00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:26,080
that

00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:27,679
happens a lot when you use features is

00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:30,880
that you don't really have to

00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:32,960
use it so it's easy to

00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:35,039
basically import a feature and then have

00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:36,640
another developer do some changes

00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:38,240
and then you try to re-import that

00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,880
feature again and then you run into

00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:42,159
issues

00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:44,880
that's also a a problem right um

00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:46,159
so yeah that's that's i think that's the

00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,960
biggest difference the features were

00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:50,240
never made to

00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:53,279
to keep these things into configuration

00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:55,840
um see

00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:57,360
we have a bunch of questions um i'll be

00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,080
sure to try to get through all of them

00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,919
right now

00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:01,600
is there a way to see kevin asks is

00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:02,000
there a way to see which permissions are

00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:05,440
related

00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:09,360
to values managed as configuration

00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:11,600
all the permissions that a user has

00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:12,640
are managed as configuration basically

00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:15,760
all of them

00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:16,000
so i'm not sure if i'm not understanding

00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,840
your

00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,200
question correctly but yeah any change

00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:22,399
you do to permissions

00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:24,559
is a configuration change

00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:26,000
um do you have nicholas asked do you

00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:27,679
have a workflow for getting perfect

00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,399
changes from production back to the code

00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:30,960
base yeah

00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:33,120
um it's the easiest thing like once once

00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:35,840
you know that you are going to have

00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:36,559
some changes in production all you have

00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,960
to do is

00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:40,320
go you can use the ui you can export the

00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:44,000
full file

00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:46,960
and that file is a compressed file of

00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,159
the configuration files um you can

00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:50,080
extract that

00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:51,600
copy those files over to the repo and

00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:53,600
just save that

00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:55,520
and push that commit and you can call it

00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:57,840
like you know synchronizing

00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:59,120
configuration from the live site and

00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:01,760
that's basically it

00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:02,960
um again the only thing where this gets

00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:04,720
kind of tricky is the

00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:07,039
if the client is changing some part of

00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:08,240
the site that is also being worked on

00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:11,760
right so if

00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:13,919
um i don't know their decline or on the

00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:16,240
production side a field was

00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:17,919
removed and that field is used for

00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:19,919
something else that you're doing

00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:21,440
uh while building out the site then yeah

00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:22,720
sure that that gets tricky really

00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:24,159
quickly but um

00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,600
you know it's one of those things that

00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:27,440
you kind of have to manage and take a

00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:30,159
look and see

00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:31,760
one by one one by one cases what

00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:33,600
configurations you should take

00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:36,080
either the live site or the one you're

00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,080
working on

00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:40,000
how can you manage configuration for

00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:42,720
different sites in a multi-site

00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,120
setup that question is very interesting

00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:45,520
i

00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:48,080
to be completely frank i have not used

00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:50,880
multi-sites in a very long time

00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:51,840
and i would not want to answer that

00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:55,200
question

00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:57,600
uh erroneously so i will keep that uh

00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:59,360
in my back pocket and research that a

00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:01,760
little bit because i'm not really sure

00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:04,000
how it works i would kind of assume

00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:05,200
that since it's the multi-site it would

00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,320
it's shared

00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:11,120
yeah or it split somehow but i'm i'm i'm

00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:13,279
i apologize i do not i shy away from

00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:15,420
multi-sites a lot

00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:17,679
um see

00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:19,440
[Music]

00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:21,120
mitchell says when you make a conflict

00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:22,480
change on dev and push it to probably

00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:25,679
you need to write a w

00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:26,720
update using hook just no a hook update

00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:30,320
is not needed

00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:33,919
at all you can just run the sync um

00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:36,159
that is when you make a change to dev

00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:37,679
um and for example i'm gonna take the

00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:38,880
pantheon example right just because

00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:43,440
that's what we use

00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:44,960
if you make a change on dev um and then

00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:47,279
uh well i'm sorry when you when you

00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:49,520
create the the changes in the report

00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:50,399
and you push it to dev um when you push

00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:52,240
that to test

00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:53,520
it's pushing the same files right from

00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:55,919
the master

00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:57,200
branch up to test and then it's pushing

00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:59,200
the same files

00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:00,799
up to the live environment right so all

00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:02,960
you have to do is synchronize you do not

00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:05,840
have to do a hookup thing for

00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:07,120
sure on remote multi-site platforms like

00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:08,720
real site factory

00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:10,240
all the websites share the same setting

00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:11,120
file do you know how to configuration

00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,640
splits

00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:14,159
the different sites can be implemented

00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:16,559
yep i

00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:17,600
think uh i just answered that question

00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:19,279
before that i

00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:21,600
just do not know enough between

00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:23,919
multi-sites especially on like a

00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:25,039
vendor like the aqua site factory you

00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:26,880
would have to check with

00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:28,799
their documentation how they manage

00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:30,559
things

00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:32,000
um how would you handle situations where

00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:33,760
configurations are expected

00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,519
to be different between test and pod

00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:38,720
environment chris asked this

00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:40,080
all right so there are like and

00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:42,240
i've mentioned this a couple times now

00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:45,519
there are use cases where

00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:46,240
um we are expecting uh the configuration

00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:49,200
to be different

00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:50,720
right in test and prod um analytics

00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:53,519
google adwords

00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:55,360
you know ads i'm sorry um so using

00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:56,559
configuration split or configuration

00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:59,440
ignore is your

00:31:56,559 --> 00:32:00,720
way to go so that way you do have two

00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:02,159
configuration

00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:04,399
that are different but you can still

00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:07,279
deploy and synchronize without running

00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:07,279
into any issues

00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:12,559
um caroline is asking how do you manage

00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:14,640
config for a distribution where many

00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:16,559
sites will have the same starting code

00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:18,480
but will change configuring to be able

00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:20,080
to integrate config addition changes

00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:22,240
from the distribution

00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:24,000
yeah that's a really hard question i'm

00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:25,120
not really sure there's a is the correct

00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,760
answer for that

00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:28,960
i would say you know distributions have

00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:31,279
their own start

00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:33,200
start set of starting uh configuration

00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:34,960
and just like modules they do

00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:36,640
uh but then when they actually you know

00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:38,240
when the site gets starts getting

00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:39,840
changed and configuration gets getting

00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:41,919
starts getting changed

00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:43,760
um you know it's it's really hard to go

00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:46,320
back and and

00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:48,640
and do those changes or additions from

00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:52,080
the distribution um

00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:55,440
i i'm not really sure there's a

00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:58,640
100 foolproof answer to that um

00:32:55,440 --> 00:33:02,159
but yeah um let's see

00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:04,159
a couple more questions up here um

00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:06,000
dana is asking do you have any tips for

00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:09,519
exporting multiple related conf

00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:11,440
files via the ui related views content

00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:14,159
types taxonomy

00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:16,000
um multiple related conflict files feel

00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:19,200
the ui

00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,960
i mean if i under the quest if i

00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:22,799
understand the question correctly

00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:25,760
you know the you can look at

00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:28,799
configuration files one by one

00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:30,159
so you could technically see that

00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:32,320
i might not be understanding the

00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:35,519
question correctly but

00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:37,279
you know when you use the ui basically

00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:40,480
you can import

00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:43,440
and export all of it or you can

00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:43,919
export one file but you can't really

00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:46,559
import

00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:47,279
that one file you need to do that via

00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:51,039
code

00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:52,640
so that's the only drawback of it

00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:54,720
can you talk about split configurations

00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:56,159
yes i think and i think i've talked

00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:58,960
about it quite a few times

00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:59,519
uh it's good it's needed in certain uh

00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:02,240
moments

00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:04,159
um and conflict split and config ignore

00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:07,919
allows us to do that

00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:09,599
um i'm sorry if i put your name uh do

00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:11,119
you have any good flow for distribution

00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:12,879
to updating child sites with

00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:14,240
changes from distributions okay we

00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:16,960
talked about this

00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:17,599
um there really isn't like the best way

00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:21,200
unless you

00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:21,679
kind of um not allow users to change

00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:25,359
certain

00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:27,919
things in your site so maybe you can

00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:29,200
ignore or use the read only mode for

00:34:27,919 --> 00:34:32,320
certain things so that way

00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:33,599
the distribution is 100 certain that

00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,359
you know their their initial

00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:37,200
configuration hasn't changed and the

00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:39,280
change that they're adding now will

00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:41,440
massively break the site that's the only

00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:45,280
way i would i would see it as a viable

00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:45,280
setup um

00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:49,040
terry is asking is there an automated

00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:51,040
way to compare configuration files

00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,599
between sites aside from doing manually

00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:54,720
on the

00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:57,599
command line interface um i mean

00:34:54,720 --> 00:35:00,079
you depending on the where the site is

00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:02,000
you could use a diff

00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:03,280
actually no because the configuration

00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,839
wouldn't be exported yet

00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:06,880
no i don't think there is i think you do

00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:08,960
need the

00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,920
the ui to basically tell you if there's

00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:12,560
been a change

00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:13,599
um i mean feel free to correct me if i'm

00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:17,359
wrong but

00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:19,040
um yeah it's basically what we

00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:20,720
what tells you if there's been a change

00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:22,880
or not because unless that

00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:23,760
change is exported um and the

00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:27,119
configuration is

00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:29,200
is exported um and synchronized

00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:31,359
you there's no like there's no different

00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:33,599
files right there's no way

00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:35,520
to know unless you you know i guess you

00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:37,359
could compare databases somehow but that

00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:40,320
seems also kind of messy

00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:40,320
um so yeah

00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:45,839
um let's see

00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:47,599
scott is saying it's best to remove

00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:50,000
modules in two separate pushes first to

00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:52,079
install a second to remove code

00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,040
that's a hook and stock and running

00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:55,119
module

00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:57,200
um i guess it depends on the environment

00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:58,640
with pantheon we've been lucky enough to

00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:01,599
be able to do it both

00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:02,400
we you can't actually remove the code uh

00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:04,320
remove the

00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:06,560
module and then actually remove the code

00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:07,920
in one single push and without any

00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:10,839
issues

00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:12,720
so maybe it depends on your environment

00:36:10,839 --> 00:36:15,040
um

00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:16,640
duncan is asking when you name your

00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:20,000
configuration splits do you do

00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:22,640
one name for project stage test local or

00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,520
group them on functionality based we

00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:25,040
normally

00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:26,640
maybe maybe our sites aren't that

00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:29,680
complex we may

00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:33,359
we normally do to uh either

00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:34,800
prod or dev and that dev is basically

00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:36,320
you know test environment dev

00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,520
environment local environments

00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:40,560
everything that's not

00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:42,480
life so it's either live site or not

00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:46,000
live site and that's basically how we

00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:47,680
we handle it at toyota um kevin wasn't

00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,040
asked okay kevin says wasn't asking

00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:50,960
about capturing permissions themselves

00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:52,800
but granting client permission like

00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:54,960
create web form results and it changes

00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,920
company change we only would make that

00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:59,440
obvious through

00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:01,680
pain yes yeah that is correct kevin um

00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:04,000
the only issue with that is you know

00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:05,040
web forms is one of those things where

00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,520
you kind of

00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:08,960
want the client to to be able to create

00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,839
web forms right because that's the whole

00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:12,960
idea

00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:14,240
um and also we we've seen that it's one

00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:16,960
of the most

00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:19,119
um it's one of the changes that gets

00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:22,640
done most on live environments

00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:24,320
um so what we end up using if we know

00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:25,839
that the client is going to do a lot of

00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,400
changes with web forms and they're going

00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:28,560
to

00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:31,040
add fields and create another web form

00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:33,119
whatever we basically just config ignore

00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:34,640
the web form gu config ignore it's

00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:37,920
pretty cool because you can

00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:39,760
specify you know like one web form or

00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:43,200
you can specify to ignore

00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:46,800
all web forms uh using the wildcard

00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:48,720
thing so it's pretty it's pretty

00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:51,040
cool like if you know that a client is

00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:52,960
going to be using web forms or whatever

00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:54,800
you can just config ignore and then you

00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:58,160
won't ever have an issue where you

00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:59,200
uh accidentally um mess up what the

00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,960
client has done

00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:03,119
on the other hand of course if you're

00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:05,440
creating a web form on dev

00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:06,720
you're gonna have to manually recreate

00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:09,839
it on the launch site

00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:14,000
which is also bothersome

00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:16,720

00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,440
