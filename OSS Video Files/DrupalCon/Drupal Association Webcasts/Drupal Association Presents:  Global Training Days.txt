trading days our global trading days is

00:03:55,340 --> 00:04:01,360
an initiative that we started to

00:03:57,590 --> 00:04:05,200
introduce new and beginning Drupal users

00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:07,520
to the code the drupal association is

00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:12,260
partnering with training companies to

00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:15,080
make this happen so once a quarter we we

00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:17,750
send out a call to action to our

00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:20,060
trainers around the globe to participate

00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:23,030
we have two of our training companies

00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:28,070
and trainers that are doing this

00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:31,100
currently and basically it's just an

00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:34,490
introduction for new people to get into

00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:36,050
Drupal and see how see how everything

00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:38,600
works we have two different types of

00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:40,390
curriculum introduction to gerbil which

00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:44,530
is a full day of training on the

00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:48,100
basics a triple and tell the curriculum

00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:50,740
is built so that a new beacon builds a

00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:53,170
Drupal site by the end and it's ideal

00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:57,280
for people who are really exploring

00:04:53,170 --> 00:05:00,310

Drupal community and Facebook plays a

00:08:34,089 --> 00:08:38,500
very important role bringing the

00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:42,789
community together we advertise a

00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:46,089
variance in Costa Rica group Drupal RG

Initiative pitch Pia and other other

00:08:51,279 --> 00:09:01,200
cycle here and time and money investment

00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:04,420
we roughly invest around 900 bucks

00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:07,150
basically yeah first knacks and drinks

00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:07,900
in time wise we invest a small number of

00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:09,570
hours of

00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:14,290
seen ads getting things organized

answering questions from participants in

00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:19,660
rindge event we have to basically two

00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:22,720
resources one person presenting the

00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:26,530
topics and the other be helping out

00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:30,370
during the breaks how diverse is a full

00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:32,890
day training we often work on their both

00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:37,420
concepts the structure and topics for

00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:39,940
each in actually variety wiley for half

00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:43,720
a day events we have mainly two goals

00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:46,450
the first one is to help others see how

00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:49,320
Drupal can be a good career path we do

00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:53,230
this mostly for students and developers

00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:55,450
and for physician makers we try to teach

00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:57,250
them the basics so they can determine

00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:59,800
whether do plays a good fit for their

00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:01,300
projects the things that we have found

00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:03,400
that a lot of people come to the

00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:05,740
training because they they want to use

00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:07,960
Jubal but they don't have they don't

00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:12,130
know where there is the right tool for

00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:14,740
your projects and number two is theory

00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:18,430
we focused on RuPaul history the pub

00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:22,270
asics and terminology things like note C

00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:26,710
CK is views taxonomy Drupal core what

00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:29,140
else daming as well and for full day

00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:32,020
trainings one of the most significant

00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:35,950
differences all say is that we focus on

00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:38,110
a computer we work on a computer lab so

00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:41,920
people can spend half a day in saline

00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:44,590
drupal and modules learning about folder

00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:49,840
structure then creating like CC case use

00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:52,210
blogs and such and we usually have more

00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:54,700
people helping out drinking full-day

00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:57,010
trains in case someone gets stabbed

00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:59,350
during installation or something so we

00:10:57,010 --> 00:11:01,990
can move on while the other guys gives a

00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:06,130
ham and I want to give a quick

00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:07,810
testimonial here back in 2011 and exhale

00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:13,000
a training session in a coastal

00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:16,030
talentkollege foliage and we we went

00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,850
back to the campus years later to try

00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:21,850
and find a specific interest and to our

00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:23,769
surprise a few of the people we train we

00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:28,630
are actively building websites in Drupal

00:11:23,769 --> 00:11:30,490
for small business in the region so we

00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:33,790
even ended up hiring two of them and

00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:36,250
they are actually part of our company so

00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:38,290
for example with them we got to avoid

00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:43,350
the learning curve and they jumped right

00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:46,630
into clients project and just to wrap up

00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:50,649
I would like to talk about giving back

00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:53,529
to the community as a developer that

00:11:50,649 --> 00:11:55,959
started working with Drupal an early

00:11:53,529 --> 00:11:58,569
stage I was able to witness the whole

00:11:55,959 --> 00:12:02,139
come for the software is safe for the

00:11:58,569 --> 00:12:03,910
community spirit behind Drupal and as a

00:12:02,139 --> 00:12:06,970
company and excess continues to make

00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:09,250
efforts towards keeping keeping in that

00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:11,620
way we feel that giving back to the

00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:13,389
community is our duty and it has proven

00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:16,680
to benefit our company you know there's

00:12:13,389 --> 00:12:18,970
many ways so that's it from my nexus

00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:20,529
Thank You Kenny that's a really great

00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:24,970
story I didn't know about your interns

00:12:20,529 --> 00:12:26,709
and Ukraine that's really and that's

00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:28,750
exactly what global training days is

00:12:26,709 --> 00:12:31,660
about right building our core group of

00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:33,610
new developers so that you know training

00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:36,220
companies obviously can have new talent

00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:37,899
but also to spread the information about

00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:40,949
the project so thank you for sharing

00:12:37,899 --> 00:12:43,569
that so we have some upcoming dates

00:12:40,949 --> 00:12:45,339

November 14th we also heard from several

00:12:51,459 --> 00:12:55,000
community members that Friday's were

00:12:53,319 --> 00:12:58,420
difficult to arrange her full day

00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:01,689

00:13:31,959 --> 00:13:36,100
reaction

00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:38,650
I have been around Drupal since late two

00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:40,810
thousand seven I've had kind of some

00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:42,580
mixed involvement I've been on both the

00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:44,440
site building side and also on the

00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:49,630
business side of things mostly marketing

00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:52,090
i am now focused on training in general

00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:54,460
my focuses on end users and new site

00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:56,500
builders the blink Institute as a whole

00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:58,690
goes beyond that we do a lot of

00:13:56,500 --> 00:14:01,390
customized private trainings we get into

00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:03,310
not only site builder but also the

00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:05,290
theming and the development side of

00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:07,930
things you know some symphony trying to

00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:10,930
get things like that I can be found

00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:14,320
pretty much everywhere on the online as

00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:16,390
in each am drupal.org Twitter skype

00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:22,660
wherever you're looking at probably Amy

00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:26,080
Chan next link reaction is a

00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:27,760
full-service Drupal centric agency along

00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:31,420
with the training division which is the

00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:33,610
blank Institute we do a full delivery of

00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:34,750
triple related services from the

00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:38,050
strategic consulting through

00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:40,300
implementation and support you can see

00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:43,360
some of our client list here we tend to

00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:46,300
emphasize long term relationships with

00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:48,040
our clients and along with the

00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:50,460
consulting and delivery adoption

00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:57,340
training services are being part of our

00:14:50,460 --> 00:15:00,460
what we offer our clients for our sorry

00:14:57,340 --> 00:15:03,040
for that's okay for our global trading

00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:05,770
days we go with a half-day program but

00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:08,710
we do it twice so we'll offer we usually

00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:12,400
use the hello Drupal curriculum and we

00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:13,930
offer that at say ten a.m. and 2pm we do

00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:16,060
this in New York we have a training

00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:18,310
facility in soho that we use and

00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:22,300
sometimes we offer it remotely as well

00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:23,950
or gotomeeting we use the curriculum but

00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:27,190
the emphasis is very heavily on

00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:29,020
discussion we try to make sure the

00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:30,670
people are getting the understanding

00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:33,340
that they need an engaging person to

00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:34,930
person we think that's really important

00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:36,370
for you know we want to get more people

00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:38,950
using Drupal want to make it less

00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:40,450
mysterious make it friendly and you know

00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:41,650
definitely when we have new Drupal is

00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:42,910
sooo there where we want we want them to

00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:46,089
feel like this is something they want to

00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:48,129
continue being involved in

00:15:46,089 --> 00:15:50,740
as far as promoting our global trading

00:15:48,129 --> 00:15:53,410
days I think I think we use probably the

00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:54,999
usual channels we use our own site we

00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:57,879
post to the aqua training site where

00:15:54,999 --> 00:15:59,889
water back was trading partners and we

00:15:57,879 --> 00:16:02,920
use you know the social media sites your

00:15:59,889 --> 00:16:04,990
twitter facebook linkedin but we found

00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:08,410
that most of our signups tend to come in

00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:12,420
through the cupola toward listing for

00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:16,959
global trading days so we definitely um

00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:19,839
excuse me you know we didn't we

00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:21,249
definitely try to you know point people

00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:22,839
in that direction so they can get a real

00:16:21,249 --> 00:16:26,680
sense of what global training day is

00:16:22,839 --> 00:16:28,660
about as far as the cost and I think we

00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:31,480
run about five hundred dollars per

00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:35,889
instance that's mostly in our venue fees

00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:38,139
and as far as what comes out of it we it

00:16:35,889 --> 00:16:39,790
does lead to some paid trainings I know

00:16:38,139 --> 00:16:43,059
I'm working with a private client right

00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:44,470
now who was in not the most recent

00:16:43,059 --> 00:16:47,110
global trading day but the one back in

00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:49,089
November and we definitely get a lot of

00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:50,350
new Drupal is continuing on you know we

00:16:49,089 --> 00:16:52,029
just had a nice camp over this past

00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:54,339
weekend and I saw a couple people that I

00:16:52,029 --> 00:16:56,649
had met before in global trading days

00:16:54,339 --> 00:16:59,259
and they continued to engage with Drupal

00:16:56,649 --> 00:17:01,360
and the new york city community so that

00:16:59,259 --> 00:17:02,949
was really great to see and obviously

00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:09,039
it's great brand awareness for the

00:17:02,949 --> 00:17:12,610
organization um that's pretty much what

00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:15,069
i have great thanks Amy um it's nice

00:17:12,610 --> 00:17:16,959
that you got to see some of your former

00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:19,149
students at nice camp that's that's

00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:20,799
really great yeah yeah it's nice to see

00:17:19,149 --> 00:17:24,750
people continue on with the technology

00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:29,320
okay agent with the community great um

00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:33,779
so moving on the big question how do you

00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:33,779
sign up and we have a forum on

00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:40,860
Association drupal.org I listed here

00:17:37,299 --> 00:17:43,000
also you can type in webinars and you

00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:46,510
excuse me global tourney days and you

00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:50,039
can see where that's located and ask

00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:52,870
some basic questions about your company

00:17:50,039 --> 00:17:54,789
you know what the site you want it to

00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:58,930
link to so that people can register on

00:17:54,789 --> 00:18:03,010
your site and just some

00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:05,050
information that we can use to have some

00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:09,760
metrics to measure our global training

00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:12,820
days in our successes so it looks like

00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:15,040
there's no questions listed here I just

00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:20,410
want to talk really quickly about some

00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:22,240
of our some of our curriculum that Amy

00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:25,060
and mentioned earlier we have some

00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:26,920
curriculum available though we are

00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:30,610
forming a committee of trainers in

00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:32,530
spring 2014 to combine some efforts and

00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:34,600
make a comprehensive and easy-to-use

00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:38,500
curriculum the curriculum that's

00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:41,530
available is is really in depth and it's

00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:43,030
very well made I just could be a little

00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:46,900
overwhelming for something like a

00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:48,760
half-day or a full day of training so um

00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:51,640
if if there's anyone in the community

00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:54,720
