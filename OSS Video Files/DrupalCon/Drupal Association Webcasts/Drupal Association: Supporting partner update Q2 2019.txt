00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:40,079
without the support of our Drupal

00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:41,340
Association supporters we couldn't do

00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:43,439

00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:45,530

00:01:57,149 --> 00:02:05,159

thank you everybody who's online with us

00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:13,140
today I'm excited to do my first

00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:13,890
supporter webinar so thank you again for

00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:16,050
the warm welcome

00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:17,850
to the community and and know that you

00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:20,760
all have a direct line to me as you have

00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:22,230
ideas and suggestions um one thing that

00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,160
I wanted to go over today this is

00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:25,560
something we've been talking about

00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:27,569
internally at the Drupal Association and

00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:29,010
really things that are on my mind that I

00:02:27,569 --> 00:02:31,290
want to make sure that our community

00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:32,760
knows so a lot of what we're focused on

00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:34,650
is we want to make sure that we can

00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:36,480
communicate and collaborate beyond our

00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:38,190
typical Drupal channels we

00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,380
affectionately call this the Drupal

00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:43,230
bubble and what we mean by that is

00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:46,230
there's a large need for us to grow both

00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:48,000
adoption and community members so that

00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:49,980
we can accelerate the project and one of

00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,780
the best ways to do that is to reach out

00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:54,500
to people we don't normally get in front

00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:57,690
of so if you have any ideas of

00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:59,370
conferences we can join to be at from a

00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:00,810
thought leadership perspective or if

00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:02,400
there are organizations we should be

00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:04,370
collaborating with that we don't today

00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:07,920
we'd love to hear from you about those

00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:10,620
we're also going to be taking the baton

00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:13,320
from Drees and his diverse diversity and

00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:15,269
inclusion keynote that he gave in

00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:16,739
Seattle and so we take that very

00:03:15,269 --> 00:03:19,079
seriously and one thing we'll be doing

00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:21,750
as an association is putting together a

00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:23,790
written strategic plan to support all of

00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:26,340
those goals so you'll be seeing things

00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:28,500
come out over the next few months and

00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:31,560
we'll be looking for community input on

00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:33,329
those as well something that's very

00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:35,549
applicable to the folks that are with us

00:03:33,329 --> 00:03:37,560
today is we're gonna be having an

00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:39,450
increased focus on relationship building

00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:41,670
with our supporting partners and key

00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:44,610
stakeholders we want to make sure that

00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:46,739
we understand what we can do for you to

00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:49,500
be great partners what's going to help

00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:52,079
drive your business and and not only the

00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:53,370
community at the project as a whole so

00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:55,290
we want to work with you to get creative

00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:56,910
and what those solutions look like and

00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:59,670
you're going to see some exciting things

00:03:56,910 --> 00:04:01,260
coming out soon especially thanks to

00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:03,150
Carrie and her team who've been getting

00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:05,510
very creative and what we can do to be

00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:08,100
great partners with everybody involved

00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:10,410
we also want to be able to really

00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:12,570
recognize and reward contributions and

00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:14,370
we talk about contributions we typically

00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:16,079
think of code but we're also really

00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:18,900
thinking about time and talent and

00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:21,329
treasure so you know the time that you

00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:23,820
put into the community it's not just the

00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:25,919
code contribution which is huge but

00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:27,780
those of you running camps driving

00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:29,940
events pulling people in

00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:32,130
that are new members of the community

00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:33,600
giving us your thought leadership in a

00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:35,190
variety of ways we want to make sure

00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,080
that we capture and recognize those

00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:38,780
things because they really Drive what

00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:41,940
we're trying to do

00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:43,710
I've also heard from many of you about

00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:45,960
the need to make sure we have really

00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:48,480
great systems that develop and scale our

00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:50,250
local associations and camps so what

00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:52,200
we'll be doing is working with all of

00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:54,600
you that already know how to do this

00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:56,640
really really well and we'll be putting

00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:58,230
together best practices and trainings

00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:00,480
that we can roll out to the entire

00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:02,280
community and the goal here is to make

00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:04,200
sure that nobody has to reinvent the

00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:06,660
wheel that we're making the best use of

00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:08,370
all the resources collectively and that

00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:11,190
we continue to scale what we're trying

00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:13,620
to do as a drupal community and lastly

00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:16,080
wanted to give you a heads up that we

00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:18,390
are looking at enhancing our membership

00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:21,450
model and our benefits both individuals

00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:23,430
and organizations it rolls right into

00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:24,930
what we talked about from a relationship

00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:27,300
building standpoint but we're always

00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:29,460
looking at how we can be the best

00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:31,200
association for you the community and

00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:33,240
what things are really going to be

00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:35,310
helpful for the business community in

00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:39,419
particular so keep an eye out for those

00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:41,370
exciting developments an exciting

00:05:39,419 --> 00:05:43,410
development for us and I think it will

00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:45,240
be for you too as I talked about it is

00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:48,510
our newest leadership team member and

00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:51,810
her name is Carol Barnard and she's our

00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:54,870
new leader for marketing communications

00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:57,060
and outreach and Carol comes to us with

00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:58,979
a great background in marketing and

00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:01,770
communications a lot of great nonprofit

00:05:58,979 --> 00:06:04,260
experience but has picked up so quickly

00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:06,060
on Drupal and our community and

00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:07,979
technology in general and she's bringing

00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:11,220
some great perspective to us from the

00:06:07,979 --> 00:06:13,080
outside in and on the next slide I'll

00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:14,760
show you what Carol and I and the team

00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:16,440
are really looking at these are things

00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:18,390
that Carol is going to help us drive

00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:20,520
that I think are important to you as

00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:22,140
well and that is really looking at a

00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:25,140
strategic communications and marketing

00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:26,490
plan not just for the DA itself but how

00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:29,820
do we help from a marketing perspective

00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:32,400
for our entire community everything that

00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:34,169
we do is going to have the lens of how

00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,599
are we driving support and adoption to

00:06:34,169 --> 00:06:39,090
support the project we're going to help

00:06:36,599 --> 00:06:41,520
you by learning to tell the Drupal story

00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:43,020
even better than we do today and

00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:45,000
to think about how we tell it to

00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:47,039
different audiences that matter so we

00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,169
bring more people into the fold every

00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:51,150
time but also with the limbs on

00:06:49,169 --> 00:06:52,919
diversity inclusion make sure that we're

00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:55,470
highlighting our diverse and global

00:06:52,919 --> 00:06:57,479
community we're going to be looking at

00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:59,069
expanding our community engagement so I

00:06:57,479 --> 00:07:02,250
mentioned this briefly before is a

00:06:59,069 --> 00:07:03,960
personal mission but reaching into other

00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:06,449
parts of the community that we don't

00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:09,060
touch today and really seeing how we can

00:07:06,449 --> 00:07:10,650
engage them in the Drupal project even

00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:12,780
things that you'll start to see at

00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:15,300
Drupal con where we're going to engage

00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:18,389
the local communities we're looking at

00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:20,699
STEM education nonprofits we're looking

00:07:18,389 --> 00:07:22,560
at local colleges and university and how

00:07:20,699 --> 00:07:26,099
we can get you know that next generation

00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:27,780
of Drupal errs into the fold and Carol

00:07:26,099 --> 00:07:29,849
is going to be a whiz at this so get

00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:32,190
very excited about increasing our

00:07:29,849 --> 00:07:34,380
digital presence and earned media so she

00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:36,840
brings a lot of experience to the table

00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:39,750
where we can take what we do well and do

00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:41,610
it even better and we ultimately want to

00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:44,009
become thought leaders to the point that

00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:46,319
media is calling us about all things

00:07:44,009 --> 00:07:49,349
technology and open-source and this is a

00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:52,349
way to get there promoting Drupal wanted

00:07:49,349 --> 00:07:53,430
to give a quick update on this so I want

00:07:52,349 --> 00:07:57,150
to make sure that everybody knows that

00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:59,190
we do have the Drupal brand book in the

00:07:57,150 --> 00:08:01,560
drupal video the drupal video is a great

00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:03,240
intro to drupal as a business it's a

00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:06,120
great way to show clients or potential

00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:07,560
clients what Drupal can do for you and

00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:09,539
in addition to that I think you'll find

00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:11,940
valuable the Drupal pitch deck if you

reception on Wednesday night in addition

00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:38,580
to the big opening reception that we do

00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:41,550
on Tuesday just to provide more fun and

00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:44,130
networking opportunities for all we're

00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:46,140
also continuing to create content and

00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:48,690
onboarding opportunities for all Drupal

00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:51,060
personas which we have categorized as

00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:55,080
builders content digital marketers

00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:56,910
agency leaders and decision-makers a few

00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:59,580
things to note in just weeks about

00:11:56,910 --> 00:12:02,730
programming for 2020 that you'll see in

00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:05,520
the next slide agency the agency leader

00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:07,140
track will move back to just a one-day

00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:09,960
summit that's going to be happening on

00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:11,940
Monday at Drupal con and then the

00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:15,000
content digital marketing track is back

00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:17,100
we're continuing to create that content

00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,530
for marketing professionals who are

00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:22,230
responsible for content gen and demand

00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:24,960
generation product marketing and user

00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:27,390
journeys one thing to note is that we're

00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:29,010
moving to one ticket for the Builder and

00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:31,080
content and digital marketing tracks

00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:33,960
since there is so much overlap between

00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:36,030
those audiences zeal purchase one

00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:37,440
DrupalCon ticket to attend the Builder

00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:39,480
or the content digital marketing

00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:41,070
sessions on Wednesday for Thursday and

00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:43,290
then you'll need to secure additional

00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:44,670
summit or training tickets for the

00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:50,150
special programming on Monday and

00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:54,090
Tuesday we are also continuing to expand

00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:56,370
our Drupal executive summit series we've

00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:58,290
been hosting summits and roundtables

00:12:56,370 --> 00:13:02,100
that are designed for CTOs

00:12:58,290 --> 00:13:03,960
CIOs CMOS and other tech leaders and

00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:06,000
organizations that either already used

00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:09,360
your pull or those that are evaluating

00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:12,120
Drupal you can see some of the the

00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:14,580
previous events that we've hosted

00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:16,830
already including standalone executive

00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:19,530
summits some ones that are part of

00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:22,440
Drupal con as well as roundtables that

00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:24,750
are that we partner and put on with them

00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:26,620
Drupal regional events like Drupal gov

00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:31,180
con

00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:33,400
there are a few entries paths for entry

00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:34,980
I should say which bury a vary based on

00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:36,970
the size and the scale of the event

00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:39,240
ranging from being a supportive partner

00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:41,530
to an executive summit sponsor

00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:43,180
Minneapolis the the Minneapolis

00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:44,410
executive summit is scheduled for May

00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:46,600
19th at DrupalCon

00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:48,370
but please do stay tuned for more

00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:50,410
announcements around additional

00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:53,710
standalone summits and roundtables

00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:58,330
happening soon and with that I'll hand

00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:59,950
it over to Jim Lennon thanks Gary

00:13:58,330 --> 00:14:02,140
on the subject of the different places

00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:03,730
that we kind of co-locate events and

00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:07,330
have begun attending and expanding our

00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:09,280
presence at other other events we've

00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:11,650
been on the road quite a bit recently so

00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:13,330
the you may if you've participated in

00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:15,640
some of these scenes some folks from the

00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:18,700
DA at these different places so recently

00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:21,220
we were present at OSCON with a Drupal

00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:24,010
booth and a Drupal Association booth and

00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:26,860
met with other open-source projects in

00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:29,770
their open source alley in the Austin

00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:33,040
exhibitor hall we also sent a staff

00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:34,900
member to the PDX partners and diversity

00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:37,630
summit which was sort of a networking

00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:39,910
event to learn about ways to increase

00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:42,790
diversity in communities hosted here in

00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:45,850
Portland where many of us are located

00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:49,120
finally we attended Drupal gov con and

00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:50,560
Midwest Drupal summit to both

00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,990
opportunities to network with the

00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:55,420
community and different audiences so

00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:56,890
we've been going coast-to-coast back and

00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:58,330
forth for the last several weeks and

00:14:56,890 --> 00:15:00,820
trying to get a better get out there and

00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:02,410
be present so if there are key events

00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:03,910
where you think important conversations

00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:06,220
could happen to help advance the project

00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:07,990
feel free to reach out to us and perhaps

00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:09,670
send us an invite and we can continue to

00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:13,090
expand our presence in these other

00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:14,770
places with that I'd like to roll into

00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:18,490
some updates from the engineering team

00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:20,410
on drupal.org and some related services

00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:22,870
that we maintain there's a lot of cool

00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:25,120
stuff that's been going on and your

00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:26,500
support the funds you provide us as a

00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,300
supporting partner have made all this

00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:30,700
work possible so thank you very much on

00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:32,860
behalf of my teams and this is that team

00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:34,600
the top row being the members of the

00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:37,840
tuple association staff and the bottom

00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:39,250
to being contract and volunteer

00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:41,620
contributors who work with us very

00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:43,450
closely on the regular

00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:44,890
one thing that we're doing is trying to

00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:47,170
find ways to increase outreach to

00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:49,390
existing Drupal customers so we are

00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:51,280
actually participating in a core

00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:54,100
initiative called the messaging channel

00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:56,380
in core initiative so the idea here is

00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:59,290
that we can actually create a channel in

00:15:56,380 --> 00:16:02,400
the admin interface of Drupal it to

00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:05,170
which we can post messages about

00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:07,000
important news for the project important

00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:10,030
Drupal Association news and events

00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:12,850
things of that sort so I want to say

00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:14,710
thank you to Lola bot annex where two

00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:16,300
organizations that are partnering to

00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:20,500
help us move this forward so it's our

00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:22,390
hope that we can build out this this new

00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:23,920
feature and get it included in core and

00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:25,990
perhaps even bath ported to older

00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:28,510
versions so that we can reach out to the

00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:30,070
broad base of users who have Drupal

00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:31,960
sites but might not be engaged in our

00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:33,760
other channels life on Drupal at org or

00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:37,780
our newsletters and things like that it

00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:39,820
should expand our reach quite a bit as

00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:42,190
mentioned earlier we also did a recent

00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:44,770
revamp of the case study format on

00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:46,000
drupal.org and this is something you can

00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:47,620
talk to your account managers about

00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,910
submitting new case studies and being a

00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:50,620
part of the featured showcase if you'd

00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:52,780
like to do that but we have a new

00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:54,430
featured showcase area that just sort of

00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:56,380
reformats how we present the case

00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:58,630
studies and has an improved set of

00:16:56,380 --> 00:17:01,330
filters for filtering by version and

00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:03,130
industry and there's some additional

00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:05,589
enhancements that we might make here as

00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:08,020
we get more information about what we'd

00:17:05,589 --> 00:17:09,690
like to how we'd like to be able to

00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:11,829
slice and dice all of the great stories

00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:14,829
that you've shared with us and promote

00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:18,970
it don't drink about org the new format

00:17:14,829 --> 00:17:20,890
looks this is looking real blurry so

00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:22,000
sorry about that something's going on

00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:25,209
with the feed but the new format

00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:28,329
includes a nice cover image some good

00:17:25,209 --> 00:17:31,960
content areas and just a more I would

00:17:28,329 --> 00:17:33,460
say narrative focus to the case studies

00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:34,840
they're less kind of fundamentally

00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:37,240
technical in nature and a much better

00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:40,180
tool for just presenting the story of a

00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:42,430
powerful Drupal case study furthermore

00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:44,440
they also have a print format now so

00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:46,630
that if you ever need sort of the PDF

00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:49,970
version of a case study you can get that

00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:51,200
from your drupal.org submitted version

00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:54,080
additionally we've been making some

00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:56,030
improvements to documentation so there's

00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:57,950
a just a small feature that's been

00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:59,950
that's a nice quality of life feature

00:17:57,950 --> 00:18:02,480
there's now an automatically generated

00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:03,560
table of contents on any documentation

00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,870
page on drupal.org

00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:08,390
several people helped out who I've

00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:09,950
listed in the sidebar here but basically

00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:11,930
any anchor link and documentation

00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:13,340
becomes part of this table of contents

00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:15,050
which should make it easier for folks

00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:18,920
who are just looking for help to get

00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:20,150
started with Drupal we also again in

00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:22,760
collaboration with some community

00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:24,680
members deployed some work to help

00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:26,600
improve international collaboration so

00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:28,130
you've probably seen if you're anywhere

00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:31,130
on drupal.org issue queues or the

00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:32,690
comment stream that there are now little

00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:34,580
indicators of what language some

00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:37,340
contributors might speak or what country

00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:39,050
they're in or even the pronouns they use

00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:40,580
different things like that so that we

00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:43,070
can just create a little bit more

00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:44,570
cultural context so that people

00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:45,770
collaborating together can understand

00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:47,930
when there might be a language barrier

00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:49,790
at play or anything like that and also

00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:52,130
just to recognize how international our

00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:54,410
community really is I want to call out

00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:56,270
just a fish in particular as an user who

00:18:54,410 --> 00:19:00,710
really did a lot of work to make this

00:18:56,270 --> 00:19:02,180
happen along with our team there's also

00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:04,580
been some Drupal CI improvements over

00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:06,830
the course of the last quarter as you

00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:08,510
know Drupal CI is the testing system

00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:10,340
which makes sure that there are no

00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:12,200
regressions and new releases of Drupal

00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:14,450
and that allow us to validate new

00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:17,210
features or support for new environments

00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:18,770
and things like that so it certainly is

00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:20,300
on the highly technical side but I think

00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:22,670
it's one of the most critical services

00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:24,590
that we provide to the community in

00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:28,550
particular the testing environment now

00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:31,970
supports testing against 7.3 stable of

00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:34,790
PHP also the 7.4 beta of PHP and

00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:37,370
Postgres equal 9.5 are now all supported

00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:39,230
for testing so we can make sure too that

00:19:37,370 --> 00:19:42,460
these will all be Drupal compatible

00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:45,380
we've actually already discovered some

00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:47,240
very minor bugs as a result of adding

00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:49,520
beta testing for some of these features

00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:51,770
and been able to contribute fixes

00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:53,060
upstream that will improve it for all of

00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:56,720
these users not just the Drupal

00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:58,130
community finally as you know the

00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,660
automatic update initiative has been

00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:00,920
underway for a while the Drupal

00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:02,450
Association has been working together

00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:03,500
with the European Commission on this

00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:04,850
initiative

00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:08,300
try and provide an automatic update

00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:10,580
feature in Drupal as mentioned in the

00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:12,740
last update there's some basic work in

00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:14,720
place already that you can sort of demo

00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:16,730
if you went and looked at the project in

00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:18,860
terms of readiness checks that figure

00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:20,720
out if the site will actually cleanly

00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:22,610
apply automatic updates and things like

00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:25,310
that but in addition to that we've been

00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:27,380
recently in fact as Midwest rupal Summit

00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:30,320
working with several community members

00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:31,580
who helped produce the package signing

00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:33,470
system that we're going to use so that

00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:35,990
we can sign and verify the packages

00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:38,270
being delivered by drupal.org to Drupal

00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:41,360
sites make sure that they're in fact the

00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:43,250
correct packages that it's secure and

00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:44,960
make sure that we have a really robust

00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:47,120
layer of security around the automatic

00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:49,490
update system and so there's some cool

00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:52,010
work there there's a project called PHP

00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:53,060
signify that you can find that's

00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:54,980
actually on the Drupal Association

00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:56,510
github because it's not a Drupal

00:20:54,980 --> 00:21:00,890
specific project it can work for anybody

00:20:56,510 --> 00:21:03,080
in PHP finally we're continuing our work

00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:04,760
for further integrations and enhancing

00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:06,680
our tool set with git lab as you know

00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:09,650
gitlab is now the backend of all of the

00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:12,710
drupal adored code collaboration the

00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:14,150
next set of features is the forking and

00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:16,820
merge request feature so we actually

00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:18,650
again sort of demoed that in a

00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:20,960
development State at Midwest Drupal

00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:23,420
summits got some feedback on the

00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:24,680
permissions and user experience for

00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:27,890
integrating that into the drupal.org

00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:29,750
issue queues so there should be more on

00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:31,460
that coming pretty soon so keep an eye

00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:35,420
out and hopefully we'll have some

00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:36,860
awesome new collaboration features so

00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:38,360
thank you on behalf of the engineering

00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:41,740
team for your support and I want to hand

00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:44,540
it back to Kerri I think to wrap us up

00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:48,460
yeah thanks again for your support just

00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:50,900
a reminder of how you can stay informed

managers myself urge Alang Alang we also

00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:04,730
did create a supporting partner slack

00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:07,430
channel not necessarily to stay informed

00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:09,650
about da news but as a way to connect

00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:11,660
with each other and just you know make

00:22:09,650 --> 00:22:13,520
sure you're collaborating and having

00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:15,540
kind of a safe space to stay connected

00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:17,910
with other supporters

00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:21,470

00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:25,110
channel please reach out and let us know

00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:27,210
again just thanks to Tim and welcome

Heather to your first supporter webcast

00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:31,440
it's really great to have you here

00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:33,240
we want to take this opportunity to

00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:35,610
thank all of our supporters for

00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:37,860
everything they do for the association

00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:39,030
and the project we're really excited to

00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:41,220
continue working with you to create

00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:43,440
really compelling benefits for your

00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:45,420
organization that also support the

00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:48,120
project in the in the community and you

00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:49,800
couldn't do any of this without you so

00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:52,320
right now I think we'll just open it up

00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:53,520
to see if there are any questions from

00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:56,130
the group

00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:57,840
yeah so I've been monitoring the chat in

00:22:56,130 --> 00:23:00,030
the Q&A section it doesn't look like

00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:02,700
there's anything in there but we'll give

00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:05,280
it another minute or two just in case

00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:08,730
anybody has a follow-up question they'd

00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:10,680
like to ask but in the meantime yes

00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:12,900
thank you very much for attending today

00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:15,150
it's great to have you here and we will

00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:17,910
be sending out the recording at the end

00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:24,510
s once it has processed and we've got it

00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:25,029
uploaded let's see I think we'll give it

00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:26,649
another

00:23:25,029 --> 00:23:28,269
two seconds and then we'll call it if

00:23:26,649 --> 00:23:32,739
there are no questions thanks very much

00:23:28,269 --> 00:23:35,019
everyone thank you to all I'm really

00:23:32,739 --> 00:23:36,399
excited to be here and look forward to

00:23:35,019 --> 00:23:44,279
hopefully meeting all of you in person

00:23:36,399 --> 00:23:50,909
at one of our upcoming events all right

00:23:44,279 --> 00:23:58,359
all right thanks everyone

00:23:50,909 --> 00:24:00,459

00:24:00,459 --> 00:24:04,659
Drupal community and we look forward to

00:24:02,049 --> 00:24:07,559
connecting with you soon thanks Co
