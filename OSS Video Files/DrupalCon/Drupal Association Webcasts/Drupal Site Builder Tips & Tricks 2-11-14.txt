from our technology supporters which

00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:43,200

00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,299

00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,819
really excited to have our panelists and

00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:50,610
guest speakers here today to talk about

00:01:47,819 --> 00:01:54,270
what they're doing to help our Drupal

00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:55,739
community build even better sites so

00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:57,929
before we get going we'll just do a

00:01:55,739 --> 00:02:00,149
little housekeeping so if you're

00:01:57,929 --> 00:02:01,799
listening from your computer you want to

00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:05,009
make sure that you're selecting the mic

00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:06,450
and speaker audio option the wise it

00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:08,700
might be a little challenging to hear

00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:11,849
and also make sure you're wearing a

00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:14,220
headset we do have everyone muted during

00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:17,790
the call but if you do have a question

00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:20,370
go ahead and use the question portion of

00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:23,430
your control panel and I'll be watching

00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:24,930
that so as each presenter speaks when

00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:27,600
they're done with their ten-minute

00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:29,069
portions I can read the questions unless

00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,780
it's something really relevant to what

00:02:29,069 --> 00:02:32,670
they're talking about at that moment but

00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:36,420
I can read the questions in the

00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:38,370
presenter will respond we're not using

00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:40,170
the chat function today just one too

00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:41,400
many portions of the control panel to

00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:45,930
manage so just make sure you're using

00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:49,470
the Q&A window and also there's going to

00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:51,359
be a post webinar survey so please take

00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:53,340
a few seconds just to fill that out we

00:02:51,359 --> 00:02:55,440
just always want to know how we've done

00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:57,060
with our presentations what kind of

00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:01,410
content you want to hear next so we can

00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:03,419
tailor this to your needs and also I

00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:05,120
just wanted to thank you for supporting

00:03:03,419 --> 00:03:08,340
drupal association attending our webinar

00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:10,470
we're doing more and more every year to

00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:12,959
support the growth of our community and

00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:15,480
putting programs in place to help all of

00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:19,980
you become our to keep innovating the

00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:22,139
project and so we're using program fees

00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:24,060
from companies like our technology

00:03:22,139 --> 00:03:26,220
supporters to do a lot of amazing things

00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:30,630
so we're now running three Drupal cons a

00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:32,910
year and we are

00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:34,740
also doing a lot of trainings around the

00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:37,110
world or coordinating trainings through

00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:38,820
the global training days program so it's

00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:41,010
a real grassroots way of getting more

00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:42,810
developers and site builders to

00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:44,280
understand what Drupal is and how to get

00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:47,250
started in our community and with the

00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:49,740
with the project we also have community

00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:51,390
grants that we give out to members of

00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:54,690
the community that have all kinds of

00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:57,060
neat ideas for growing the community and

00:03:54,690 --> 00:04:00,800
also just raising the Drupal's profile

00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:03,300
in the marketplace so funds have gone to

00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:07,740
marketing road shows throughout Austria

00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:10,560
to a spanish-speaking magazine in Latin

00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:12,600
America that's talking about Drupal and

00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,670
lastly we have been doing a lot

00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:17,700
especially this year really pushing to

00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:21,270
do more improvements for drupal org so

00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:22,410
that way your community home is it's

00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:24,600
getting better and better and you have

00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:25,860
the tools that you need it's easier to

00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:28,770
find modules we have a lot coming

00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:33,810
together in terms of drupal.org

00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:35,970
improvements well one the really big

00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:38,880
things I want to point out today is that

00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:41,190
the dribbled org improvements are being

00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,810
funded by the technology supporters

00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:46,380
including the ones you're hearing today

00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:48,420

00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:21,930
these are collection of software

00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:25,740
companies that really want to see Drupal

00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:27,810
flourish they have invested a lot of

00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:30,180
energy to make sure that their

00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:31,740

build some amazing solutions for our

00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:38,490
clients and so they wanted to give back

00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:40,740
to the community by joining the

00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:42,720

00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:47,850
improvements that I talked about and

00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:51,090
just going to the next slide one of the

00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:54,150
improvements oops sorry if you can go to

00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:56,130
the slide about the site builder I think

00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:57,330
it was one out of order I apologize so

00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:59,910
the landing page is one of the

00:06:57,330 --> 00:07:02,010
improvements that we have we are

00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:05,460
starting to redesign the content on

00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:07,560
drupal.org and we want to have persona

00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:10,230
specific content that really aggravates

00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:12,600
everything that different types of

00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:14,880
Drupal community members would need so

00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:17,540
today I know we have a lot of people

00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:20,280
attending that our site builders and

00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:22,050
this is a new landing page that you can

00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:23,520
take advantage of it aggregates

00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:25,650
everything and kind of supports that

00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,140
whole life cycle of learning how to

00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:29,250
become a site builder all the way to

00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:32,280
contributing back and maintaining

00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:35,970
modules and it goes on and on so it's a

00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:37,200
really resource-rich landing page that

00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:41,310

for those of you who haven't seen video

00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:13,870
cloud before video cloud is an online

00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:16,300
video platform where publishers and

00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:17,649
content producers can as you see down

00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:20,529
the left hand side take their source

00:09:17,649 --> 00:09:21,820
video content they can either export

00:09:20,529 --> 00:09:24,640
that from their digital asset management

00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:26,260
system or maybe directly out of their

00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,339
content management system where they're

00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:31,240
creating this content and actually

00:09:27,339 --> 00:09:32,800
ingest it into a video platform so the

00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:34,149
ingest can be done through a studio

00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:37,390
interface it can be done through batch

00:09:34,149 --> 00:09:39,040
API batch XML excuse me or it can be

00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:41,500
done directly via API which is obviously

00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:43,029
my favorite method and so you have a

00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:45,399
number of different ways as content

00:09:43,029 --> 00:09:47,529
producers to get your source video in 2

00:09:45,399 --> 00:09:49,060
video cloud and video cloud is a Content

00:09:47,529 --> 00:09:50,769
meta data system you can see the

00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:54,550
services that it provides or down a kind

00:09:50,769 --> 00:09:56,410
of in the UH nepali but you could things

00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:57,670
obviously in go to encoding to all the

00:09:56,410 --> 00:10:00,339
different file formats that are needed

00:09:57,670 --> 00:10:03,130
for playback across desktop mobile web

00:10:00,339 --> 00:10:04,810
native connected TV all the different

00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:06,850
app all the different platforms that are

00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:09,040
needed velocity all allows you to also

00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:10,769
to manage the meta data related to that

00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:13,170
video organized

00:10:10,769 --> 00:10:16,529
content set ad policies and monetize

00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:18,540
that content design what your experience

00:10:16,529 --> 00:10:20,279
needs to look like player templating and

00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:21,989
styling then obviously distribute and

00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:23,939
syndicate the content from video cloud

00:10:21,989 --> 00:10:25,920
out to places like Facebook and YouTube

00:10:23,939 --> 00:10:28,589
automatically and of course as a rich

00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:30,899
set of reporting and analytics that are

00:10:28,589 --> 00:10:33,989
also available via API for integration

00:10:30,899 --> 00:10:35,279
into a custom analytic sweet JP so once

00:10:33,989 --> 00:10:37,259
you've got that content in the video

00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:38,759
cloud what happens to get it back out

00:10:37,259 --> 00:10:41,429
you have a set of video players to

00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:42,600
publish you can distribute via Mrs S or

00:10:41,429 --> 00:10:44,850
you can actually access it

00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:46,980
programmatically via API and that's

00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:49,529
those api's or what the drupal module is

00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:52,339
built upon so let's go ahead and go to

00:10:49,529 --> 00:10:52,339
the next slide please

00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:56,690
so I went to talk oh this did not kind

00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:58,370
of go the way I thought it was going to

00:10:56,690 --> 00:11:01,700
go I thought this had a step-by-step

00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:03,410
through but i'll talk about these use

00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:06,410
cases apologize these got stacked here

00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:08,060
so we have a number of over a thousand

00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:10,310
customers currently using the drupal

00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:13,490
module some of those as you can see here

00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:15,320
at rubicon prague was broadcast the live

00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:16,820
quino's using video cloud that little

00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:18,890
section you can see underneath of watch

00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:21,290
live is the actual video cloud player

00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:23,600
you can see things like the information

00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:26,120
the social functions on it the

00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,670
shareability and the embed code icon to

00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:30,890
the top right those are all customizable

00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:33,260
movie on other customers like the Daily

00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:35,480
Racing Form who are using it in an ad

00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:38,180
funded model we have customers like well

00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:41,030
Brightcove itself uses the drupal module

00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:43,190
on our own website for marketing use

00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:45,680
cases if customers like digital

00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:48,800
classrooms who used the module along

00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:50,570
with via cloud for an interesting use

00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:53,410
case where they have a subtitle module

00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:55,400
down the right-hand side that actually

00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:56,990
indexes every single word of the video

00:11:55,400 --> 00:12:00,290
and so you can skip around look for a

00:11:56,990 --> 00:12:01,880
keyword and then click on it and jump to

00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:03,890
that point of the video so it's a tight

00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:06,560
integration between you know one or more

00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:12,310
modules that you could install so let's

00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:14,260
go ahead and move forward so this talk

00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:17,380
little bit about it the we've invested

00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:19,720
quite a bit in the module we have a

00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:20,710
company that is actively maintaining and

00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:23,950
supporting it which is called Pro

00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:27,070
Novak's you can see here what Brightcove

00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:29,910
ships with is immediate API media API is

00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:33,460
basically our kind of server to server

00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:34,930
ingestion and advanced mechanism for

00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:37,330
interacting with all that meta data and

00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:39,160
all the video URLs and video information

00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:42,040
that's stored inside a video cloud so

00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:44,560
all of the modules that like the drupal

00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:46,570
module are built upon that media API we

00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:49,810
also ship from people that want to use

00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:52,060
that access we ship a rapper who is it

00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:53,830
notes here in the first line a PHP media

00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:56,350
API rapid that you can very easily use

00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:59,980
so you don't have to do the guts of you

00:12:56,350 --> 00:13:02,550
know the API creation using Jason that

00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:04,930
is all wrapper and expose for you so

00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:07,620
Brightcove integration for Drupal 7 has

00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:10,839
some dependencies as notice here

00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:12,760
obviously uses the API it's been around

00:13:10,839 --> 00:13:14,589
for a number of years at this point and

00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:17,020
we were important to note that we're

00:13:14,589 --> 00:13:18,700
actively building actively maintaining

00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:21,310
this module it's not something that

00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:23,710
we've kind of launched we are putting

00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:27,400
money into supporting this and making

00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:31,350
changes and expanding this module let's

00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:33,400
go ahead to the next slide please so

00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:35,170
exciting developments we recently posted

00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:37,120
a blog as you can see we've made some

00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:40,420
changes we realize that with enterprise

00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:43,360
customers needing needed an additional

00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:45,280
level of cashing in the module so that's

00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:48,370
been recently added as well as support

00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:49,660
for X portables the other things that is

00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:52,600
you can see you there other things that

00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:54,339
are coming soon so we're also investing

00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:57,400
in making these fixes and changes to the

00:13:54,339 --> 00:13:58,600
module so that that's a think that's it

00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:01,959
I think that might be my last slide if

00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:03,970
you go next yep that's it but thank you

00:14:01,959 --> 00:14:06,640
very much i welcome any questions about

00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:08,800
video cloud or the drupal module yeah

00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:10,029
david this is megan don't see any

00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:13,020
questions but i just really wanted to

00:14:10,029 --> 00:14:16,390
say you know couple thank-yous one is

00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:17,860
breakups been a long supporter of our

00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:20,890
Drupal cons and what I love about

00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:23,860
working with you and your video module

00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:25,840
is you know not only is it just great

00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:28,630
content to have our keynotes

00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:30,700
drained live right there on our site but

00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:32,110
it's green and thousands more people to

00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:34,870
our website and bringing a lot more

00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:38,530
visibility to our conferences that way

00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:40,330
so it's a really great you know new kind

00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:44,440
of feature functionality to bring to

00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:45,910
your website build and I really love how

00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:47,080
you highlighted that there's your

00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:48,790
different integrations that you're even

00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:49,990
working with community members because

00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:51,730
so many community members are

00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:53,680
volunteering time to build modules

00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:55,930
that's a lot of work so by partnering

00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:58,570
with them you can help them sustain and

00:14:55,930 --> 00:15:00,040
keep those integrations up to date and

00:14:58,570 --> 00:15:01,750
that's going to be even more important

00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:03,070
as we move forward for Drupal 8 and we

00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:05,200
want to make sure all those modules are

00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:08,140
ready as we get ready to go live with

00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:09,910
that new release later this year so I

00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:12,100
just wanted to say thanks for all your

00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:18,820
support and it's certainly great

00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:24,070
technology oh and I do have one question

00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:25,690
for you David that just came in the

00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:27,820
question is so would content editors

00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:32,350
upload the video using the Drupal

00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:35,700
interface or with the upload on an

00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:35,700
outside Brightcove site

00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:43,089
so the module allows you to do the

00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:45,490
upload directly as most of our CMS

00:15:43,089 --> 00:15:46,870
integrations do but for a kind of

00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:48,550
enhanced hong shao it kind of simplifies

00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:50,199
the publishing workflow but for advanced

00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:52,480
workflow things there is a chance you

00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:53,800
might want to users might want to go

00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:59,850
directly into video cloud and use the

00:15:53,800 --> 00:16:03,459
studio studio with you I excuse me okay

00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:05,019
all right well and our attendees says

00:16:03,459 --> 00:16:07,629
thank you I'm not see any more questions

00:16:05,019 --> 00:16:11,279
so I'll move right on over then to quell

00:16:07,629 --> 00:16:16,149
kelton tech and I'd like to introduce a

00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:17,829
Sushil Kumar Tripathi and he has over

00:16:16,149 --> 00:16:19,149
eight years and open-source technology

00:16:17,829 --> 00:16:22,300
is really passionate about building

00:16:19,149 --> 00:16:25,149
solutions especially for Drupal and so

00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:28,600

00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:57,330
connection sushil are you still there

00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:03,480
well while we're waiting for him to come

00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:11,339
back online why don't we move ahead then

00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:17,610
me just introduce Michael and so he has

00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:19,770
a nice long history very well-versed in

00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:21,089
marketing platforms but I also just want

00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:22,680
to point out that he's a real active

00:17:21,089 --> 00:17:23,940
supporter of the Drupal community so

00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:27,089
we're excited to have him here to talk

00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:30,480
about email marketing and constant

00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:33,890
contacts a drupal module so Michael

00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,890
would you like to take it from here

00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:39,350
you

00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,820
yes thank you anything for that great

00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:45,740
introduction if we go to the next slide

00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:47,540
that'd be fantastic so some quick things

00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:50,210
where I talk about just maximizing

00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:52,640
customer engagement on my favorite

00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:54,650
topics is email it's not good social

00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:57,020
media effectiveness and then of course

00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:58,220
Constant Contact loves Drupal so let's

00:17:57,020 --> 00:18:01,370
go the next slide and I'll start that

00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:03,680
presentation here which looks like we're

00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:05,090
missing women but when the questions

00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:08,240
people say is ok I've got this website

00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:10,580
what do I do now and like to start by

00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:13,460
saying ok of a website so what you guys

00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:15,410
take time you've got your drupal CMS

00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:18,350
platform installed you've created this

00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:20,330
website you've got a great template but

00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:22,160
what does that mean and the reason I

00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:24,560
asked is because when i create my first

00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:27,620
website i spent hours on it and i was so

00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:30,650
excited and I'm back next day I pulled

00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:33,800
up the web stats I had one visitor it

00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:35,630
was my mom uh you know website is a

00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:37,640
fantastic platform but doesn't do us a

00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:39,020
lot of good if we can't get people to

00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:41,000
interact with it and we don't have

00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:44,000
people coming back to us and buying our

00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,320
products or user services so one things

00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,610
that we really encourage a constant

00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:48,770
contact is that you just don't market

00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:50,780
just don't have the website I'll find

00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:53,240
one ways to engage your users find ways

00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:55,760
to engage your visitors as we like the

00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:56,600
idea of engagement marketing and there's

00:18:55,760 --> 00:19:00,950
a couple different ways we can do that

00:18:56,600 --> 00:19:02,720
if you go the next slide here oh you

00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:06,110
know we really encourage email marketing

00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:07,370
newsletters announcements and the other

00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:08,690
day I got an email from somebody who is

00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:10,790
like hey look you work a constant

00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:13,070
contact I just want to tell you that

00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:15,250
email is dead no one uses email anymore

00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:17,720
why are you guys still marketing this

00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:21,500
and it took me a second because you sent

00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:23,060
me this via email and I think in some

00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:24,950
places there's this idea that you know

00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:26,630
if email is gone but the reality is how

00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:28,850
many of us still use email made us still

00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:30,640
communicate via email how many of us got

00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:33,020
a reminder for the webinar via email

00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,280
email still very very effective means of

00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:37,070
communication it's still one of the most

00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:38,900
popular ways to do that and so it would

00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:40,310
really encourage people to know do email

00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:42,950
marketing have people sign for email

00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:46,130
lists stay in contact the other reason

00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:48,260
we really encourage email is you know so

00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:50,820
makeups your website what if they never

00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:52,080
come back you know what they like your

00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:54,330
say they like the product but you were

00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:56,850
just busy they get taken away my life

00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:58,169
and they just forget you know if you

00:19:56,850 --> 00:19:59,970
have that sign up chat box or say hey

00:19:58,169 --> 00:20:01,169
you slap for my newsletter people can

00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:03,389
sign up and then you can keep them

00:20:01,169 --> 00:20:04,590
informed in fact the other day I just

00:20:03,389 --> 00:20:06,690
got an email from a company I haven't

00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:07,769
visited over a year saying hey look we

00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:08,970
had some new products would you be

00:20:07,769 --> 00:20:11,460
interested in next thing I know I'm on

00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:13,409
their website buying things we can that

00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:15,659
allows you stay your engagement with the

00:20:13,409 --> 00:20:17,039
with the customer or with your visitor

00:20:15,659 --> 00:20:20,669
laws you state communication with them

00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:22,259
another thing surveys and polls you know

00:20:20,669 --> 00:20:23,820
customers like give you feedback and you

00:20:22,259 --> 00:20:25,950
want create a means for them to give

00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:29,039
feedback to you whether it's a Contact

00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:30,720
Us link or a contact us form or just x

00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:33,480
out hey are we doing a good job what do

00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:34,379
you think where you views you even after

00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:36,360
the webinar we're gonna have a quick

00:20:34,379 --> 00:20:37,799
survey saying hey how the prisoners do

00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:39,450
and hopefully everybody will say you

00:20:37,799 --> 00:20:41,610
know that constant contact guy he was

00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:42,960
awesome if not shoot me an email and

00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:46,019
i'll hopefully drive you guys to say

00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:48,090
that we also want you guys to look at

00:20:46,019 --> 00:20:50,669
using events you know it's great to have

00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:52,320
that online communication but if you're

00:20:50,669 --> 00:20:53,850
using your website you know for a small

00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,200
business then you want people to come

00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:58,379
visit your store you want people to

00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:00,600
interact with you so not just taking and

00:20:58,379 --> 00:21:03,240
doing all this online marketing but also

00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:05,029
say hey let's step up unless have people

00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:07,350
come to the store let's have an event

00:21:05,029 --> 00:21:09,269
Gail Goodwin our CEO it is a fantastic

00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:11,759
job of talking about engagement

00:21:09,269 --> 00:21:14,940
marketing talk about how how one lady

00:21:11,759 --> 00:21:16,590
who owns a kitchen store it would have

00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:19,379
these covery classes and people would

00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:21,269
come in they trail these knives and it

00:21:19,379 --> 00:21:22,889
was a no pressure come and just tried

00:21:21,269 --> 00:21:24,450
out but we were so impressed by the

00:21:22,889 --> 00:21:26,070
knives and all the other products at

00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:27,509
they walk away you know spending tons of

00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:29,399
money because they were engaged they

00:21:27,509 --> 00:21:30,960
were able to see what was going on and

00:21:29,399 --> 00:21:34,950
last but not least the buzzword of

00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:36,509
course is social media and I think about

00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:38,700
social media is you can't just put a

00:21:36,509 --> 00:21:41,309
post on facebook or send out a tweet and

00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:44,250
have 10 million followers or 10 million

00:21:41,309 --> 00:21:46,289
likes you know it goes back the old

00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:47,789
adage of create an iphone app you can't

00:21:46,289 --> 00:21:49,019
just create the app throw on the store

00:21:47,789 --> 00:21:52,500
and be a millionaire the next day it

00:21:49,019 --> 00:21:54,809
takes work it takes cultivation and it's

00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:56,059
a lot of work you know part my job with

00:21:54,809 --> 00:21:59,460
constant contact is managing our

00:21:56,059 --> 00:22:00,659
constant contact KPI twitter feed and it

00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:01,740
means being engaged every day and

00:22:00,659 --> 00:22:03,990
finding ways to keep your customers

00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:06,270
coming back for your visitors come back

00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:08,280
interested and so we really encourage

00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:10,590
you with the social media not used to be

00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:12,690
posting you know irrelevant data but

00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:13,980
also be sharing things are important

00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:15,600
part of your company engaging your

00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:16,800
customers trying to find ways to have

00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:19,440
people sign for your mailing this

00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:20,750
through social media find ways to share

00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:24,870
your events through social media

00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:28,190
offering sweepstakes your game feedback

00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:30,960
through all this means and so I guess

00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:32,490
when really encouraging is take a look

00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,650
at how you can do more with your website

00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:36,320
and not just build the website but find

00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:40,080
ways to encourage people to use it and

00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:43,050
find ways to turn new visitors into

00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:44,990
relationships find ways to take a stag

00:22:43,050 --> 00:22:47,610
visitor in turn into a caged customer

00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:48,809
now if only there was something that

00:22:47,610 --> 00:22:53,100
would do that if we go to the next slide

00:22:48,809 --> 00:22:54,840
please I mean if only there is one

00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:56,790
solution that could take care of all

00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:58,710
these things that would allow you to do

00:22:56,790 --> 00:23:00,720
email marketing allow you to do surveys

00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:02,429
allow you to you know hold events and

00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,809
have people registered events and allow

00:23:02,429 --> 00:23:06,179
you to type all of this into social

00:23:03,809 --> 00:23:07,890
media as well if only you could set an

00:23:06,179 --> 00:23:11,190
email campaign and then like seamlessly

00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:13,650
put it on Twitter and Facebook or create

00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:16,050
event and seamlessly email individuals

00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:17,820
the information on the event oh yes

00:23:16,050 --> 00:23:19,350
third there is this constant contact we

00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:21,720
do to all these we do offer this as a

00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:23,010
nice service and the reason we do that

00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:24,630
is we try make it more convenient so you

00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:26,160
don't have to use a whole bunch of

00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:27,630
different services that don't really

00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:29,990
play well together to accomplish this

00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:33,570
but have everything in one single place

00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:35,160
but again that's fantastic but we kind

00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:39,059
of need a drupal module for that so if

00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:40,410
you on the next slide so if only there

00:23:39,059 --> 00:23:42,120
was a week there is a different module

00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:44,070
not them encouraging people to download

00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:46,380
and use it but you totally should if you

00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:48,420
go to drupal.org search for the constant

00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:50,460
contact module you'll find it it's a

00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:52,410
great module it handles tons of

00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:54,090
different things you can have a sign up

00:23:52,410 --> 00:23:56,940
checkbox when people register for your

00:23:54,090 --> 00:23:59,340
site you can add multiple custom signup

00:23:56,940 --> 00:24:01,890
forms to any page or sidebar on your

00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:03,720
site you can actually manage your lists

00:24:01,890 --> 00:24:06,500
from within counts or within Drupal's

00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:08,490
you can add edit and delete contacts

00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:09,420
there's just a lot of different features

00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:12,780
you can do with it you can create custom

00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:14,850
fields and then it also integrates with

00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:15,780
the web form for constant contacts I

00:24:14,850 --> 00:24:17,820
mean there's less different things you

00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:19,980
can do it to really give you control in

00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:21,540
drupal to manager your list and really

00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:23,520
get this engagement and at the same time

00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:25,170
we are really focused on trying to

00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,880

00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:32,370
those three things I think that's a good

00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:33,450
good simple step but i wanted to point

00:25:32,370 --> 00:25:35,310
out just a few things that you mentioned

00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:37,560
that i thought were pretty notable one

00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:40,380
is you know as we're building sites for

00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:42,570
clients you know it's not just a better

00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:44,430
just picking modules and features but

00:25:42,570 --> 00:25:47,160
also understanding what what their

00:25:44,430 --> 00:25:48,840
business needs are and building the

00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:50,370
solution that's right for them so i

00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:52,530
really like how you talked about like

00:25:50,370 --> 00:25:53,760
marketing platform best practices of

00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:55,140
what's really happening with email and

00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:59,010
how to support that as well as social

00:25:55,140 --> 00:26:00,840
media and because it helps people

00:25:59,010 --> 00:26:04,040
understand is how constant contact is

00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:07,080
able to support those business needs and

00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:09,590
i think that's really really valuable

00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:13,730
for people to understand as they're

00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:15,810
selecting one module over the other and

00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:17,700
so I really appreciate going to that

00:26:15,810 --> 00:26:19,770
level of detail and then the other thing

00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:21,380
too is I actually had a chance to go and

00:26:19,770 --> 00:26:24,330
check out your module page and I thought

00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:27,570
it was incredibly useful was really well

00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:30,420
written you know you took a lot of care

00:26:27,570 --> 00:26:31,380
into explaining what that module

00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:33,600
supports in

00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:36,840
all the features and what people need to

00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:38,340
do to get started so I just thought that

00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:40,170
was pretty notable that you took that

00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:41,790
time to make it so easy for people to

00:26:40,170 --> 00:26:44,040
understand where to begin with your

00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:46,560
module and also we made it really easy

00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:48,300
to find you too so so i'm sure people

00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:51,660
want to reach out to you and ask you

00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:53,460
some questions i currently don't see any

00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:59,660
coming up but here's a question right

00:26:53,460 --> 00:27:03,480
right now for you so can you explain

00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:07,290
Michael what version Constant Contact

00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:08,820
supports one person is saying that they

00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:11,310
thought it was supported back in twenty

00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:13,430
twelve it perhaps there's a newer

00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:13,430
version

00:27:17,209 --> 00:27:21,089
so yeah the short answer that question

00:27:19,799 --> 00:27:23,429
is regarding the module it's actually

00:27:21,089 --> 00:27:25,499
built by a third party and so we don't

00:27:23,429 --> 00:27:27,539
actively support that module I believe

00:27:25,499 --> 00:27:31,139
it does support Drupal 7 of people last

00:27:27,539 --> 00:27:32,459
update to that was in may of 2013 as for

00:27:31,139 --> 00:27:34,499
Drupal 8 we are actually working on

00:27:32,459 --> 00:27:36,570
eating some more modules out there we're

00:27:34,499 --> 00:27:38,129
building up our own modules that will

00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:40,229
offer loss support and will support

00:27:38,129 --> 00:27:44,849
Drupal 8 as well as some previous pack

00:27:40,229 --> 00:27:46,589
versions well that's great and as soon

00:27:44,849 --> 00:27:50,039
as that information is ready let us know

00:27:46,589 --> 00:27:52,019
we can push that out to our attendees

00:27:50,039 --> 00:27:53,609
here at the webinar and out into the

00:27:52,019 --> 00:27:55,139
community and of course that goes for

00:27:53,609 --> 00:27:57,029
all of our partners just want to keep

00:27:55,139 --> 00:27:59,039
doing that information out there to date

00:27:57,029 --> 00:28:00,179
will definitely do that and yet people

00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:02,129
want to follow us on twitter too we're

00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:04,200
have a lot of bass playing with Drupal

00:28:02,129 --> 00:28:07,129
and we'll be posting those on our tech

00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:11,519
blog and then also be a pilot Twitter

00:28:07,129 --> 00:28:14,009
great okay good well I don't see any

00:28:11,519 --> 00:28:20,899
other questions so then I will oh I'm

00:28:14,009 --> 00:28:23,700
sorry there oh okay it looks like that

00:28:20,899 --> 00:28:25,829
that also this is an opportunity for

00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:27,690
someone to get involved with that module

00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:30,450
to help maintain it that they're looking

00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:33,209
for some more support for maintaining

00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:34,679
the module so you know this is also a

00:28:33,209 --> 00:28:37,469
good opportunity to connect with the

00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:39,239
community to make sure that Michael that

00:28:37,469 --> 00:28:41,009
you know any way we can help you find

00:28:39,239 --> 00:28:43,379
someone to really maintain that or take

00:28:41,009 --> 00:28:44,519
it to the next level let us know if

00:28:43,379 --> 00:28:46,859

alright so the next presenter today is

00:29:01,349 --> 00:29:07,679
christine sotelo from New Relic and she

00:29:05,909 --> 00:29:10,109
is an expert in application performance

00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:13,259
management and today she's going to talk

00:29:10,109 --> 00:29:16,169
about how New Relic is here to make your

00:29:13,259 --> 00:29:20,579
life easier so Christine go ahead and

00:29:16,169 --> 00:29:22,440
take it from here Thank You Megan and

00:29:20,579 --> 00:29:24,269
then give everyone who's on the call I

00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:25,829
appreciate the opportunity to talk a

00:29:24,269 --> 00:29:28,690
little bit about New Relic and how we

00:29:25,829 --> 00:29:30,490
support Drupal

00:29:28,690 --> 00:29:32,800
so just to kind of give you an intro to

00:29:30,490 --> 00:29:36,280
New Relic New York is an application

00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:37,720
performance manager management tool so

00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:40,480
we're performed we're monitoring the

00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:43,390
performance of web applications we

00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:47,230
support over seven languages so we have

00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:50,020
net Java Ruby PHP Python and we just

00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:52,840
added nodejs and with that comes several

00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:57,190
frameworks that we support rails jboss

00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:59,200
and etc etc but we do have a special

00:29:57,190 --> 00:30:01,540
place in our hearts for Drupal and we've

00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:05,620
actually built in Drupal monitoring into

00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:07,180
our new Ella Qi and so that's basically

00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:09,040
what I want to come and talk about today

00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:12,700
I'm in addition to application web

00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:14,800
application monitoring we do also mobile

00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:17,140
application monitoring server monitoring

00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:20,890
and we've also launched a platform plug

00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:24,040
in central for extensions via plugins

00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:26,580
that are downloadable for free so that's

00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:30,630
just a little bit about New Relic and

00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:30,630
you can go to the next slide

00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:35,280
oh yeah so here's my talking points um

00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:37,850
so yeah that's a little bit about New

00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:40,410
Relic as I mentioned we do support a

00:30:37,850 --> 00:30:42,810
performance monitoring for PHP

00:30:40,410 --> 00:30:44,970
applications and what that monitoring

00:30:42,810 --> 00:30:46,620
comes in an overview of how your

00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:48,890
application is performing both on the

00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:51,630
server side as well as the browser side

00:30:48,890 --> 00:30:54,330
geography of where customers are located

00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:56,730
air raids we have alerting capabilities

00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:58,770
and we also dive deep into the code

00:30:56,730 --> 00:31:01,290
level visibility with transaction traces

00:30:58,770 --> 00:31:03,480
so you're getting information on your

00:31:01,290 --> 00:31:06,510
sequel call details explain plans and

00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:08,400
full stack traces so you'll see Drupal

00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:11,400
support coming through the different

00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:14,880
areas but also we kind of give a deep

00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:17,610
dive into how your modules hooks and

00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:19,230
views are performing so with that kind

00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:22,440
of deep dive you're getting call times

00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:24,180
crawl counts and a lot more details so

00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:26,600
if you go ahead an advance to the next

00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:26,600
slide all

00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:32,400
yeah I'll show you a little bit how it

00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:35,160
works here so right now we're looking at

00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:36,720
the new relic interface you can see that

00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:38,550
and there's several different tabs our

00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,930
overview our app maps to show you how

00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:42,540
your applications are talking to each

00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:44,040
other web transactions and and then as I

00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:47,250
mentioned right here built in you have

00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:49,320
Drupal support and we're looking at you

00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:52,080
know our top five modules by response

00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:53,730
time that are taking the longest so

00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:56,940
we're giving you kind of the details on

00:31:53,730 --> 00:31:57,900
which modules you know are actually

00:31:56,940 --> 00:32:00,360
affecting the performance of your

00:31:57,900 --> 00:32:02,810
application and then allows you to drill

00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:07,800
into those modules and see why exactly

00:32:02,810 --> 00:32:11,120
those might be time consuming and you

00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:11,120
can advance to the next slide

00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:18,860
you

00:32:15,410 --> 00:32:20,390
um so yeah here you also see we're

00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:22,520
providing the same kind of level of

00:32:20,390 --> 00:32:25,100
details for your your hooks that you're

00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:26,780
using and how time consuming these are

00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:29,570
as well and we allow you to drill into

00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:31,580
each of these as well so for us at New

00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:34,640
Relic we have a special dedication to

00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:36,860
Drupal we know that you know being able

00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:38,990
to provide you the ability to monitor

00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:40,910
your Drupal modules it gives you the

00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:43,940
insight to the performance impact of

00:32:40,910 --> 00:32:45,770
your modules and and the same thing with

00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:48,650
with hooks we know that hooks are the

00:32:45,770 --> 00:32:50,540
the currency of the Drupal API and so it

00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:52,100
makes Drupal the extensible system that

00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:53,780
it is today and being able to provide

00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:55,520
you metrics into those hooks it's

00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:57,500
extremely helpful for you especially if

00:32:55,520 --> 00:33:01,340
you're writing your own modules um and

00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:03,170
then I didn't put the slide here but we

00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:05,810
also provide the same level of details

00:33:03,170 --> 00:33:07,940
in tier view metrics so you're like

00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:10,130
database views drupal views are you know

00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:14,030
a great way to create reusable segments

00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:15,320
of data based on a set of criteria and

00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:16,790
you know that they're kind of reuse

00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:18,050
throughout your application and so we

00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:20,600
want to be able to give you some sort of

00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:21,770
consistency on and and how these are

00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:24,770
performing and how they affect your

00:33:21,770 --> 00:33:26,810
application and in addition to this we

00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:29,030
also provide function profiling so New

00:33:26,810 --> 00:33:31,100
Relic also provides em you know the top

00:33:29,030 --> 00:33:33,050
50 most frequently called functions and

00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:36,980
the 50 slowest functions for the

00:33:33,050 --> 00:33:39,410
individual web requests um so that's

00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:41,030
just kind of a an overview on how we can

00:33:39,410 --> 00:33:42,170
help you and how we can help you with

00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:45,890
your Drupal applications in the

00:33:42,170 --> 00:33:48,920
performance of those New Relic i'll just

00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:50,360
mention that with versions 3 and hire

00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:53,480
new relic automatically starts

00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:55,040
collecting your drupal metrics and and

00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:57,680
as i mentioned before we have a strong

00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:59,120
dedication to drupal application so once

00:33:57,680 --> 00:34:03,020
drupal 8 rolls out we'll be right there

00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:04,460
to support that as well and so so that's

00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:08,750
pretty much I think that's it for me if

00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:12,080
you advance the next slide yeah so

00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:14,900
that's kind of that's it for me well

00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:17,179
that's great it's um you know I want to

00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:19,130
thank you New Relic has been a long-term

00:34:17,179 --> 00:34:21,770
partner with a drupal association and

00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:23,780
you've been great supporters from both a

00:34:21,770 --> 00:34:25,550
technology standpoint but also coming to

00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:27,800
all of our Drupal cons and educating our

00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:32,840
community on how to use your tool and

00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:35,360
how to improve performance and so I

00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:38,060
think this was a really great snapshot

00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:39,620
into what you can do for our site

00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:42,290
builders and how you can really help

00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:45,560
them and also the user experience right

00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:47,600
and but you'll be at drupalcon Austin

00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:49,160
and exhibiting there as well so it's a

00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:51,560
great chance for the community to engage

00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:57,590
and get it even deeper understanding of

00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:59,270
what your technology can do for them and

00:34:57,590 --> 00:35:04,300
I don't see any questions coming through

00:34:59,270 --> 00:35:04,300
is everyone have any new relic questions

00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:10,460

sushi from kelson tech on you as having

00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:22,480

00:35:28,370 --> 00:35:35,480
you real fast soo shells with kelton

00:35:31,370 --> 00:35:37,910
tech and has over eight years of open

00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:40,700
source experience really passionate

00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:43,760
about Drupal and today he wants to talk

00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:45,740
to you about p.m. user image so Susheela

00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:47,900
I will just hand over the presentation

00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:53,720
to you when you need a slide advanced

00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:58,250
just let Stephanie now okay alright so

00:35:53,720 --> 00:36:00,230
okay next slide please on okay so here

00:35:58,250 --> 00:36:03,560
like we'll discuss a google image

00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:08,450
sitemap and second module is like p.m.

00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:14,540
user images that we have built so next

00:36:08,450 --> 00:36:16,370
slide please there okay so okay I think

00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:18,620
like this the animation that that was in

00:36:16,370 --> 00:36:22,550
this slide is not working like okay so

00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:25,400
let me explain let go on the google

00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:29,800
image sitemap first so willingly sitemap

00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:33,670
is like okay for the for your SEO thing

00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:37,580
as you do the SEO for your content on

00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:40,700
Google so in the same way we do the SEO

00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:41,210
for images on the Google so in the

00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:46,370
Google

00:36:41,210 --> 00:36:48,260
search your your content your images can

00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:51,200
be searched like okay with the tags and

00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:54,140
all those things so for that actually we

00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:56,360
created the google image sitemap so you

00:36:54,140 --> 00:37:00,710
can read on the google webmaster about

00:36:56,360 --> 00:37:03,110
the google image sitemap and so there

00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:07,130
you need to go and download our google

00:37:03,110 --> 00:37:10,490
image sitemap module from drupal.org tea

00:37:07,130 --> 00:37:14,810
and he just enable it and configure it

00:37:10,490 --> 00:37:16,730
like okay how many nodes has to go into

00:37:14,810 --> 00:37:20,600
the google image sitemap so it will

00:37:16,730 --> 00:37:23,240
fetch the google in the images from the

00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:26,330
image field of your content types and

00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:27,770
will create a site map for that that can

00:37:26,330 --> 00:37:31,640
be submitted to the google webmaster

00:37:27,770 --> 00:37:35,450
tool and your images will be searchable

00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:39,050
on google okay and the second side

00:37:35,450 --> 00:37:42,440
second this you can see like okay the PM

00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:45,290
user image module so this is the demo

00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:47,420
for the PM user image module so it works

00:37:45,290 --> 00:37:49,670
with the private messages so in the

00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:54,230
private messages when you are trying to

00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:56,780
create a new may series okay so there if

00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:58,460
you are like okay selecting the people

00:37:56,780 --> 00:38:02,180
like okay whom you want to send the

00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:04,790
messages so in private message module

00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:08,930
only like the drupal usernames used to

00:38:04,790 --> 00:38:12,290
come in the auto suggestions and it is

00:38:08,930 --> 00:38:15,010
very difficult to many times to identify

00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:19,400
the person who was sending the message

00:38:15,010 --> 00:38:22,400
with the Google with the Drupal username

00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:24,700
so we thought like okay we it should be

00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:28,610
like more intuitive and what we actually

00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:31,130
did we created this module so that when

00:38:28,610 --> 00:38:35,000
you do the you type start typing the

00:38:31,130 --> 00:38:38,420
name of the Drupal user so it comes with

00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:40,990
a suggestion with the image of that user

00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:43,790
also so you can see as you can see here

00:38:40,990 --> 00:38:46,250
when you type s so it is coming like

00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:50,420
before okay all the users with s and

00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:52,460
with your picture also so using this you

00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:54,440
can actually make it more intuitive the

00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:57,400
private messages module

00:38:54,440 --> 00:39:00,619
and this will work like really good so

00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:02,960
definitely the client for whom we were

00:39:00,619 --> 00:39:05,619
actually was very impressed with this

00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:08,480
thing so you can actually add in your

00:39:05,619 --> 00:39:11,630
websites also like to have a little bit

00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:17,569
of user experience so I think that's it

00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:20,240
from our side well that's fantastic and

00:39:17,569 --> 00:39:22,609
so did I understand that you worked with

00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:26,510
a client to build this and then you

00:39:22,609 --> 00:39:29,210
donated it back to the community yes yes

00:39:26,510 --> 00:39:33,530
so all these actually like whenever like

00:39:29,210 --> 00:39:35,599
any anything comes to us like suppose we

00:39:33,530 --> 00:39:37,579
need to build something there for a

00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:39,829
client so we take the permission of the

00:39:37,579 --> 00:39:42,680
client and donate it to back to the

00:39:39,829 --> 00:39:45,560
community well I think that's wonderful

00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:47,660
I mean it's a great way to not just

00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:49,010
expand and innovate the project by

00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:50,930
giving back but you're also showing the

00:39:49,010 --> 00:39:53,060
client that they're part of this open

00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:56,060
source project and kind of sharing those

00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:57,589
values and this is one the ways that we

00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:59,960
just really drive great innovation

00:39:57,589 --> 00:40:02,119
through new modules so I'm really

00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:05,329
excited that you presented that today

00:40:02,119 --> 00:40:07,970
and I know you'll be at drupalcon austin

00:40:05,329 --> 00:40:09,859
as well are you going to be demoing this

00:40:07,970 --> 00:40:12,140
and sharing more of this and your other

00:40:09,859 --> 00:40:18,920
modules at your booth at drupalcon

00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:21,800
austin excellent excellent Maloney ok

00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:25,849
let me just check our questions here I

00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:27,200
think we've answered all of them well I

00:40:25,849 --> 00:40:28,550
think we just covered some really

00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:32,630
interesting different types of

00:40:28,550 --> 00:40:35,210
technologies that help us improve the

00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:38,920
way we build Drupal sites and augment

00:40:35,210 --> 00:40:38,920
our solutions for our clients and

00:40:39,130 --> 00:40:43,040
