so welcome everyone thanks for joining

00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:08,940
us we're really excited to have you

00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:12,120
today we're going to be talking about

00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:13,799
how to successfully host a sprint and I

00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:17,010
think this is really a topical

00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:18,869
especially with Drupal 8 accelerate and

00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:20,779
all of the community Sprint's that are

00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:24,420
happening all over the world

00:00:20,779 --> 00:00:26,670
particularly with Drupal 8 but also just

00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:29,699
um you know the involvement and

00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:32,070
excitement around sprinting in the

00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:33,780
Drupal community so I think this is

00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:36,420
going to be really useful and we're

00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:38,160
we're really lucky to have cathy and

00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:40,050
david with us today to talk about that

00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:43,140
so welcome and thank you for joining us

00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:46,050
and our presenters today cathy and david

00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:49,800
and i'll let them introduce themselves

00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:52,590
cathy is a longtime sprinter and core

00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:55,199
mentor David is a wonderful sprinter and

00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:57,840
just hosted a triple eight accelerate

00:00:55,199 --> 00:01:02,850
sprint in New Jersey so without further

00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:06,960
ado Kathy when every way I'm Kathy I'm

00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:10,080
yes duty on the internet I work for

00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:14,930
black mesh there are hosting company and

00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:20,159
my job is part to work on issues part to

00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:24,840
plan sprints and also to go to them I

00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:28,640
have a ton of experience around sprints

00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:31,860
I have a small local sprint which I host

00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:34,200
once a month which has between like four

00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:37,920
and six people that come to it every

00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:41,189
time and I also work on the drupalcon

00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:46,829
Sprint's which are huge and gigantic and

00:01:41,189 --> 00:01:49,040
have like 500 people I am Eva Hernandez

00:01:46,829 --> 00:01:52,920
d McMahon is all one word on drupal.org

00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:55,710
I've been helping organize New Jersey

00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:59,060
events for good five or six years now

00:01:55,710 --> 00:02:02,490
including meetups Sprint's co workings

00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:03,719
and drupalcamp New Jersey for past four

00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:04,860
years now so I've had a lot of

00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:06,840
experience with different kinds of

00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:10,020
events doing different Sprint's

00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:11,220
different locations and doing a lot of

00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:12,180
things writing a lot of things wrong so

00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:14,510
hopefully we can share that information

00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:17,370
with you today

00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:18,660
alright so let's get right to it the

00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:20,879
first thing of course we need to talk

00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:22,349
about what these events are and what a

00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:26,129
sprint actually is for someone who's

00:02:22,349 --> 00:02:27,930
never participated a sprint is exactly

00:02:26,129 --> 00:02:30,050
what you see in the picture we have an

00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:32,790
aside here it's when people get together

00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:35,099
with their computers and they

00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:36,690
collaborate and contribute that work and

00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:38,880
that's really the big difference between

00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:40,769
sprints and other things like neat ups

00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:43,620
is that your main goal here is to

00:02:40,769 --> 00:02:45,630
contribute the work that you do whether

00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:49,110
it's to Drupal core two different

00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:50,790
contribs to documentation no matter what

00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:52,890
it is you're really contributing

00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:54,480
everything that you work on we have

00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:55,950
different kinds of sprints so you can

00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,690
have a really small sprint you can have

00:02:55,950 --> 00:03:00,360
a really big sprint like we do at

00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:03,840
rubicon and you can have Sprint's that

00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:06,120
are for everyone and have mentors which

00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,890
is a big thing we do at drupalcon making

00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:10,200
sure people are around to help new

00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:12,480
people get acclimated and you can also

00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:14,579
have focused Sprint's which we're doing

00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,829
more of now to help get Triple Eight out

00:03:14,579 --> 00:03:19,019
the door which means you take your more

00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:20,400
experienced sprinters people who are

00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:22,769
used to contributing and gone to the

00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,930
process before and they might focus on

00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:27,780
one particular subject matter whether

00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:30,420
it's just Drupal 8 criticals or just

00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:31,739
documentation or just front end work but

00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:35,389
they really focus all their efforts

00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:35,389
towards one goal to accomplish something

00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:51,540
so as part of planning a sprint is a lot

00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:54,750
about thinking about what you're going

00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:57,150
to need and the most important thing is

00:03:54,750 --> 00:04:01,470
that you have to have tables and chairs

00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:05,130
I once plan to sprint and reserved a

00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:08,639
venue and did not clarify with the venue

00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:10,470
that I needed tables and chairs and we

00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:15,120
ended up scrambling at the last minute

00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:17,959
to get them the next thing that you

00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:22,079
really need to think about is having

00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:27,000
power directly at the tables with

00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:32,330
outlets trips and we really need super

00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:37,920
Wi-Fi there are some technical details

00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:40,650
on a sprint planning document page that

00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:44,760
we have on drupal.org which is

00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:52,950
drupal.org / cordesh mentoring / sprint

00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:57,000
dash resources and I I would highly

00:04:52,950 --> 00:05:00,440
recommend going to the venue in advance

00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:04,020
and doing some testing there and

00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:07,320
checking to see what the bandwidth is

00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:13,530
like depending upon the amount of people

00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:17,370
that you have you need a ton of

00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:21,450
bandwidth so maybe like 60 megabits down

00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:24,060
and 20 megabits up and you can plan on

00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:27,630
each person having two and a half

00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:29,340
devices so you need more allowed

00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:33,419
connections that you're going to have

00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:37,020
people and that's true no matter the

00:05:33,419 --> 00:05:39,800
size of your sprint for larger Sprint's

00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:44,340
it's really super helpful to have some

00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:49,229
real life things on hand like white

00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:51,660
boards or flip charts post-it notes name

00:05:49,229 --> 00:05:55,220
tags and markers but the most important

00:05:51,660 --> 00:06:02,520
thing is tables chairs electrical and

00:05:55,220 --> 00:06:04,530
Wi-Fi I so your venue this is one of the

00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:05,940
most important considerations when

00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:09,720
planning your sprint or really planning

00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:10,800
any event if you have a bad venue you

00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:13,740
have problems with your venue it's

00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,900
really problematic so take as much time

00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:18,210
as you need to find the right place do

00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:21,840
as much research as possible talk to

00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:24,210
different people and use as much as your

00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:26,460
budget as you might need to to get a

00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:29,580
better location some of the key factors

00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:33,470
for me is make sure that your location

00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:37,200
is easy to get to don't underestimate

00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:39,150
how lazy people can be sometimes if you

00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:40,529
have a location that has an address

00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:44,639
that's hard to find it

00:06:40,529 --> 00:06:46,829
hard to put into gps it requires a lot

00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:49,319
of directions to get there it's in a

00:06:46,829 --> 00:06:51,329
building that's hidden someplace the the

00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:52,709
front entrance is not clear you know all

00:06:51,329 --> 00:06:54,869
that kind of stuff it makes it very

00:06:52,709 --> 00:06:56,639
difficult for people to get there and it

00:06:54,869 --> 00:07:00,359
makes it so they're less likely to come

00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:03,539
again so try to be near a main road try

00:07:00,359 --> 00:07:05,339
to be in a building that's easy to find

00:07:03,539 --> 00:07:08,069
and easy for people to research other

00:07:05,339 --> 00:07:09,629
own something like a library is great

00:07:08,069 --> 00:07:11,819
because if people don't have the address

00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:14,159
they can at least Google the name of the

00:07:11,819 --> 00:07:15,929
library and find out where it is but if

00:07:14,159 --> 00:07:17,549
you're in some office complex somewhere

00:07:15,929 --> 00:07:19,889
might be a little more difficult for

00:07:17,549 --> 00:07:22,199
people to find the exact building a

00:07:19,889 --> 00:07:26,969
well-known shopping center is another

00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:28,919
good idea and any location that has its

00:07:26,969 --> 00:07:32,069
own website so maybe run by management

00:07:28,919 --> 00:07:33,449
company or by a Drupal agency so they

00:07:32,069 --> 00:07:35,069
have their address listed on their

00:07:33,449 --> 00:07:39,659
website just makes it easier for people

00:07:35,069 --> 00:07:42,839
to find have good signs so one thing I

00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:45,119
like to do is put signs right on the

00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:47,459
front door with a big Drupal icon on it

00:07:45,119 --> 00:07:48,809
so it's a giant flag for people that are

00:07:47,459 --> 00:07:50,459
walking up to the building let them know

00:07:48,809 --> 00:07:52,439
this is the right entrance this is the

00:07:50,459 --> 00:07:53,969
right location have signs in the

00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:55,979
building directing people where to go

00:07:53,969 --> 00:07:59,249
where the stairs are where the elevator

00:07:55,979 --> 00:08:02,369
is where the suite is we owe that to the

00:07:59,249 --> 00:08:04,409
actual sprint location is make sure the

00:08:02,369 --> 00:08:07,229
doors are open and unlocked all the time

00:08:04,409 --> 00:08:08,639
make sure hours are visible for people

00:08:07,229 --> 00:08:10,459
and they know exactly when you're going

00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:14,129
to start and when you're going to end

00:08:10,459 --> 00:08:16,409
make sure the building is accessible so

00:08:14,129 --> 00:08:18,869
if people have handicapped they're able

00:08:16,409 --> 00:08:20,189
to get into the building and that's it's

00:08:18,869 --> 00:08:23,009
also great for everybody because

00:08:20,189 --> 00:08:25,499
sometimes you don't get supplies like

00:08:23,009 --> 00:08:27,359
you wear food and it's nice to have

00:08:25,499 --> 00:08:29,249
accessible entrances you can get into

00:08:27,359 --> 00:08:31,019
the building easier and use the elevator

00:08:29,249 --> 00:08:35,639
I'd have to walk up flights of stairs or

00:08:31,019 --> 00:08:37,559
food also be close to parking or public

00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:42,089
transit depending on you know if you're

00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:44,699
in a city or on the suburbs if people

00:08:42,089 --> 00:08:46,800
have to use street parking k 4 meters

00:08:44,699 --> 00:08:49,019
pay for parking garage things like that

00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:51,329
they're less likely to attend and we're

00:08:49,019 --> 00:08:53,100
less likely to come back so try to find

00:08:51,329 --> 00:08:54,060
a location that will have free parking

00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:57,660
that has

00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:59,520
consistent parking and that's important

00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:01,080
for the size of your event as well if

00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:04,140
you're used to running smaller events

00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:06,570
and people just use street parking that

00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:08,520
might be fine when you don't expect more

00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:10,290
than 10 or 20 people if you're gonna

00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:12,930
have an event the hundred people street

00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:15,960
parking might be a problem so take that

00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:18,060
under consideration and be consistent

00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:20,540
with your location's I think this is

00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:22,800
just as important much of your

00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:26,850
attendance is going to be based on

00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:29,730
convenience so if you run meetups and

00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:32,250
you use one location keep using that

00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:34,920
same location be consistent people will

00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:36,420
develop habits and they will know how to

00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:37,800
get there they will understand how long

00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:39,450
it takes for them to get there they'll

00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:42,029
understand where to park or what train

00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:43,650
to take they'll know exactly how to get

00:09:42,029 --> 00:09:47,100
in the building will get used to where

00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:49,560
the office is and it makes it easier to

00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:51,870
then host a sprint because you can say

00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:53,160
well the exact same place we called our

00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:59,310
meetup this is where the sprint is going

00:09:53,160 --> 00:10:03,510
to be it's very easy for people and be

00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:05,280
close to food or drink if you have a

00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:08,030
large event you probably are going to

00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:11,040
cater it which is great but if you can't

00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:13,110
make sure you're close by to something

00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:16,170
that you know people can just go out

00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:17,970
quickly and easily and get food or if

00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:18,930
you end up in a location that's too far

00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:21,690
for something like that at least

00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:22,770
communicate that to people so they know

00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:25,440
ahead of time and they can make

00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:28,530
preparations all right so if you're in a

00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:31,050
very busy business area and there's lots

00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:32,550
of restaurants nearby cafe is the like

00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:34,830
people can leave quickly and get to

00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:37,589
something but if you're not near that

00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:39,750
they might need to bring food and water

00:10:37,589 --> 00:10:41,250
coffee whatever with them so just let

00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:44,040
them know ahead of time if you're going

00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:46,890
to do that yeah letting people know

00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:50,580
ahead of time is really super regarding

00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:53,360
any of these things there is no such

00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:57,029
thing as too much advanced communication

00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:59,190
there's a really great resource which

00:10:57,029 --> 00:11:04,080
will have a link to at the end which is

00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:07,050
a Model View culture post on getting

00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:08,480
people to attend your conference who

00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:12,870
have

00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:16,140
try well moving around and they will not

00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:19,050
show up and assume that you've thought

00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:20,520
about these things in advance so when

00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:23,850
you communicate that you've thought

00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:26,760
about where it is how you're going to

00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:29,400
enter what the location is like whether

00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:31,080
or not it's accessible how long it takes

00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:32,580
to walk from the front door to the

00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:34,710
location when you communicate that stuff

00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:39,170
ahead of time it will increase your

00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:43,590
attendance on the day yeah definitely

00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:48,900
wait let's go back a little bit uh we

00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:52,920
skipped aside no that was good so uh

00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:56,730
during the presentation you can ask

00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:59,460
questions in the Q&A section as we're

00:11:56,730 --> 00:12:02,820
going along it's totally okay and then

00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:05,430
we'll also do a Q&A at the end in

00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:19,310
addition and we'll have a survey at the

00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:22,080
end so along those same lines are

00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:24,930
communicating in advance whether or not

00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:28,860
you will be providing the food good or

00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:32,370
if expected to take a break and go get

00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:35,760
food on their on their own is really

00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:40,590
nice if you have a food that you're

00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:43,260
providing do a lot of different options

00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:45,510
and you don't necessarily need to pull

00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:49,440
people in advance to find out if they're

00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:53,820
gluten-free or vegetarian or vegan if

00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:56,250
you communicate with the people who are

00:12:53,820 --> 00:13:00,600
providing the food that you need all of

00:12:56,250 --> 00:13:05,010
those options um for everyone and then

00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:07,500
it's really helpful to have signs which

00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:11,340
label the ingredients of the food and

00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:15,900
then people can pick what they need to

00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:19,790
eat on their own we have a white

00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:22,400
tradition of in the past

00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:25,400
we would have sprints and we would say

00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:28,340
oh let's order some pizzas or let's have

00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:33,380
coffee all the time and we're getting a

00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:38,870
little bit wiser now and realizing that

00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:41,780
what we provide is in part a reflection

00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:45,950
of how we respect the people who are

00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:51,230
attending so recently we have a lot more

00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:53,170
examples of having healthy food for the

00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:58,940
people who are working all day long

00:13:53,170 --> 00:14:02,810
sprinting and that is really great in

00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:04,580
terms of what they want and also in

00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:07,940
terms of the output that we're going to

00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:19,010
get from people they do better when we

00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:23,240
provide them with better food a lot of

00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:26,480
times when you're planning an event we

00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:30,520
think about the work hours from the

00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:34,370
morning and until the evening uh but

00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:35,810
especially well I guess it's no matter

00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:39,170
whether or not you're having people from

00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:45,710
out of town or in town and there is a

00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:47,840
really nice chance to UM get together at

00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:49,790
the end of the day so when you're

00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:54,890
thinking about what to what to do after

00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:59,540
the sprint if you can have a social

00:14:54,890 --> 00:15:04,070
thing on at the same location you will

00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:07,640
have more people show up for it um it's

00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:10,420
really good to have choices that are not

00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:12,860
alcohol centric there are a lot of

00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:16,160
conversations happening at the moment

00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:17,630
around tech events and alcohol and we

00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:20,210
can do a really good job of

00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:22,070
incorporating feedback from those wider

00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:27,950
conversations by making sure that we

00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:33,649
have as high quality choices for things

00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:38,629
to drink like tea and craft soda

00:15:33,649 --> 00:15:43,119
is um and it will make people feel safer

00:15:38,629 --> 00:15:47,420
and more respected it's also really nice

00:15:43,119 --> 00:15:50,059
to have some kind of social thing in the

00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:56,689
evening where people can hear each other

00:15:50,059 --> 00:15:58,790
and actually communicate yeah we

00:15:56,689 --> 00:16:01,279
actually had to change this year at my

00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:05,240
drupalcamp we used to do an after party

00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:07,279
at a bar nearby and this year we changed

00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:09,410
it up and actually did the after party

00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:11,720
in a private room that we rented in the

00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:14,269
next building over the number of people

00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:16,610
that actually stayed for that was

00:16:14,269 --> 00:16:19,579
significantly greater than when we just

00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:21,559
met the bar so people do prefer that it

00:16:19,579 --> 00:16:23,720
was much nicer time we were in a private

00:16:21,559 --> 00:16:25,639
room it was quieter everyone was there

00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:30,050
it was from the event it was much better

00:16:25,639 --> 00:16:32,899
experience all right marketing

00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:35,119
communications for a lot of people

00:16:32,899 --> 00:16:37,429
especially for developers we know that

00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:39,709
you maybe not the best communicators and

00:16:37,429 --> 00:16:42,519
so you're not great at this and may not

00:16:39,709 --> 00:16:44,329
want to do it but it's kind of too bad

00:16:42,519 --> 00:16:47,300
you're going to have to get good at it

00:16:44,329 --> 00:16:49,910
or find somebody who knows how to do it

00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:51,949
well because if you want to get

00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:53,720
attendance you have to communicate with

00:16:51,949 --> 00:16:55,819
people you have to let them know that

00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:58,579
you're having an event you have to use

00:16:55,819 --> 00:17:00,709
social media outlets you have to be very

00:16:58,579 --> 00:17:02,389
clear and specific with your information

00:17:00,709 --> 00:17:06,199
that's probably the biggest point as

00:17:02,389 --> 00:17:08,870
soon as you make decisions and you have

00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:11,899
things set in stone like your date your

00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:15,500
venue things like that let people know

00:17:11,899 --> 00:17:19,399
and give them specifics don't just say

00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:22,669
like oh this weekend or we're gonna be

00:17:19,399 --> 00:17:24,140
here someplace or just or tell them the

00:17:22,669 --> 00:17:27,079
location but don't give them the exact

00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:29,539
address no give people the exact address

00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:31,460
give them contact information give them

00:17:29,539 --> 00:17:34,970
a map link necessary give them

00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:36,260
directions give them the specific hours

00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:38,809
that you're going to start and you're

00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:40,880
going to end you know tell people if

00:17:38,809 --> 00:17:42,950
you're going to have food catered and

00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,570
tell them what those food options are if

00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:47,450
you're not going to tell them that

00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:50,179
you're not going to so that people can

00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:52,220
make preparations but usually it's fine

00:17:50,179 --> 00:17:53,510
if you don't cater for lunch people can

00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:55,610
bring their own lunch or make their own

00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:57,110
arrangements but they don't know that if

00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:58,970
you don't tell them ahead of time right

00:17:57,110 --> 00:18:00,500
so be specific about it and let them

00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:03,380
know exactly what you're going to do and

00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:04,669
what you're not going to do depending on

00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:05,990
what kind of event you're going to have

00:18:04,669 --> 00:18:08,870
it's going to be small it's going to be

00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:10,700
big tell people if you're going to have

00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:13,429
a focused sprint that's on a particular

00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:15,440
subject matter tell people exactly what

00:18:13,429 --> 00:18:17,929
it is and what's expected of them so

00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:19,880
they know ahead of time how to prepare

00:18:17,929 --> 00:18:22,220
for that or they know ahead of time that

00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:25,159
it's an event that's not for them and

00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:26,750
they shouldn't show up all right we like

00:18:25,159 --> 00:18:28,279
to think that every event is you know

00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:29,870
inclusive and it's for everybody but

00:18:28,279 --> 00:18:31,519
sometimes we do have events that are

00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:34,490
very specific and it might not be right

00:18:31,519 --> 00:18:36,230
for that person that's okay just let

00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:37,940
people know and they can make the

00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:39,380
decision that it's not best for them and

00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:41,210
maybe they don't attend that event but

00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:42,889
the attending events that's two weeks

00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:44,809
later or a month later that is for

00:18:42,889 --> 00:18:47,630
everybody it's okay to do that well you

00:18:44,809 --> 00:18:49,850
don't want to have happen is people not

00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:52,130
have the right information show up and

00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:55,880
then have a bad experience because then

00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:58,549
they will leave they will be less likely

00:18:55,880 --> 00:19:01,669
to show up again and we really don't

00:18:58,549 --> 00:19:03,409
want that so just be clear with everyone

00:19:01,669 --> 00:19:06,740
and usually everything will be just fine

00:19:03,409 --> 00:19:09,320
I also like to have a contact person

00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:10,789
that's specific if you're running a big

00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:13,100
event like a camp you probably have a

00:19:10,789 --> 00:19:14,210
camp email address at a camp Twitter

00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:17,360
account and all that kind of stuff so

00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:19,159
that's okay if it's a smaller event have

00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:22,159
one person who's handling the

00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:23,750
communications so assign that person and

00:19:22,159 --> 00:19:25,490
tell people if you have questions you

00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:27,169
can contact this person maybe that

00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:28,370
person is just you because you're the

00:19:27,169 --> 00:19:30,679
organizer and you would be the only

00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:32,870
person but let them know how they can

00:19:30,679 --> 00:19:35,269
reach you know either through your

00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:37,429
drupal.org profile or they can find you

00:19:35,269 --> 00:19:39,380
on IRC and asking questions or they can

00:19:37,429 --> 00:19:40,880
pin you on Twitter or whatever but have

00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:42,850
an actual person that people could

00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:45,200
communicate with as opposed to just

00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:47,389
posting something on group said

00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:49,399
drupal.org and maybe you don't go by

00:19:47,389 --> 00:19:50,360
often enough to see if there's comments

00:19:49,399 --> 00:19:51,919
or anything like that and a lot of

00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:54,620
people don't post comments but they

00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:58,070
might email you or just tweet you or pin

00:19:54,620 --> 00:20:00,110
you on IRC or something like that yeah

00:19:58,070 --> 00:20:01,309
there is no such thing as too much

00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:04,759
advanced community

00:20:01,309 --> 00:20:11,179
and the sooner you can announce the date

00:20:04,759 --> 00:20:15,970
of your sprint the better on even local

00:20:11,179 --> 00:20:19,850
people need time to arrange their lives

00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:22,909
in advance so they need to make

00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:24,950
arrangements for childcare or get time

00:20:22,909 --> 00:20:32,619
off of work and the sooner you can

00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:37,610
announce a date the better uh and wide

00:20:32,619 --> 00:20:40,369
broadcast announcements like making a

00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:43,610
make an event on groups terrible org

00:20:40,369 --> 00:20:47,809
which ends up causing something to show

00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:49,369
up on the Drupal call map using your

00:20:47,809 --> 00:20:51,409
local meetup to announce a special

00:20:49,369 --> 00:20:54,559
sprint all of those things are really

00:20:51,409 --> 00:20:59,899
good but something else that helps a lot

00:20:54,559 --> 00:21:04,220
is personal communication so emailing

00:20:59,899 --> 00:21:06,619
specific people and asking them like can

00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:09,320
you come is this a good time for you we

00:21:06,619 --> 00:21:13,999
really want you to go going that extra

00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:16,749
mile will also increase the amount of

00:21:13,999 --> 00:21:21,139
people that show up for your Sprint's

00:21:16,749 --> 00:21:25,249
one of the things that you can do in

00:21:21,139 --> 00:21:31,249
advance is make sure that a code of

00:21:25,249 --> 00:21:34,879
conduct is posted publicly so you can

00:21:31,249 --> 00:21:38,149
mention it in in your post if you have a

00:21:34,879 --> 00:21:42,619
website for your sprint you can link to

00:21:38,149 --> 00:21:48,019
it there um we recently held mid camp

00:21:42,619 --> 00:21:52,039
and it was in the footer on every single

00:21:48,019 --> 00:21:57,889
page of the website um this is a big

00:21:52,039 --> 00:22:00,590
deal in terms of publishing ahead of

00:21:57,889 --> 00:22:05,470
time so that people understand that it

00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:08,119
is safe for them to attend your event

00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:10,100
Cathy quick question what do you mean by

00:22:08,119 --> 00:22:13,159
can you elaborate on safe to attend the

00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:16,580
event like what would I

00:22:13,159 --> 00:22:18,409
what would the code of conduct encompass

00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:23,509
for someone that might be new or to the

00:22:18,409 --> 00:22:25,700
community so um the code of conduct

00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:28,729
usually will say something like we treat

00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:32,899
each other with respect we don't

00:22:28,729 --> 00:22:38,929
tolerate harassment in terms of gender

00:22:32,899 --> 00:22:42,590
identity on your body type all of those

00:22:38,929 --> 00:22:45,049
different things that can come up and

00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:48,349
one of the most important parts of a

00:22:45,049 --> 00:22:52,159
code of conduct is that it will

00:22:48,349 --> 00:22:54,769
explicitly say if you have an issue at

00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:57,679
our event this is the person to talk to

00:22:54,769 --> 00:23:00,679
and it will give an email address a text

00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:04,759
number and their name and a way to

00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:08,090
identify them at the event so at an

00:23:04,759 --> 00:23:09,889
opening somebody would mention the code

00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:11,809
of conduct and they'll say hey if you

00:23:09,889 --> 00:23:14,749
have any issues go talk to so-and-so

00:23:11,809 --> 00:23:18,950
so-and-so please stand up so it has a

00:23:14,749 --> 00:23:20,929
really easily identifiable person that

00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:25,659
is a point of contact at the event to

00:23:20,929 --> 00:23:29,090
talk to in case on anything comes up and

00:23:25,659 --> 00:23:31,729
the other important thing about having a

00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:34,340
code of conduct is talking to the

00:23:31,729 --> 00:23:37,190
organizers and volunteers that are at

00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:38,960
your event which could just beat you or

00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:41,210
it could be a group of people that are

00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:43,820
helping you and let them know how they

00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:46,279
should respond when somebody comes up to

00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:48,109
them and says hey this thing happened

00:23:46,279 --> 00:23:50,749
and I don't feel good about it and

00:23:48,109 --> 00:23:54,590
making it very clear that the way that

00:23:50,749 --> 00:23:57,289
you respond to that is with finding more

00:23:54,590 --> 00:24:00,979
information about what happened and

00:23:57,289 --> 00:24:05,299
redirecting to the specific person who

00:24:00,979 --> 00:24:08,749
is the point of content and let them

00:24:05,299 --> 00:24:10,340
handle it so in general not not

00:24:08,749 --> 00:24:13,179
challenging whether or not something

00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:16,489
happened but gathering information and

00:24:13,179 --> 00:24:21,070
directing them to the person who's going

00:24:16,489 --> 00:24:25,869
to deal with whatever has happened and

00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:27,330
there are a oken source code of comics

00:24:25,869 --> 00:24:31,440
available you don't have

00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:33,780
to make up your own so if you're having

00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:35,850
organizing event you don't have to be an

00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:38,760
expert or have a ton of experience you

00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:41,760
can just go to one of the example code

00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:43,200
of comics and just copy it and put it up

00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:47,420
and say hey we have a code of conduct

00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:52,460
it's really super easy to do actually

00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:58,050
there's some examples so drupal.org / DC

00:24:52,460 --> 00:25:00,000
OC and also a los angeles drupalcon

00:24:58,050 --> 00:25:02,820
coming up has a code of conduct and

00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:05,700
there are some other open source ones on

00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:07,230
the internet that you can search for so

00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:09,690
you don't have to make it up from

00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:13,320
scratch there's a lot of resources to do

00:25:09,690 --> 00:25:18,050
but the important things are to say that

00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:21,500
your sprint has one and have a person

00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:26,280
who is the primary point of contact

00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:29,790
great um and also just as a note things

00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:33,480
are kept confidential while working on

00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:34,650
whatever the situation may be I think

00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:38,150
that's really important for people to

00:25:34,650 --> 00:25:38,150
know so they feel like they can share

00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:47,840
okay funding this is another big one so

00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:50,820
if you're running a small event

00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:52,200
obviously you can do that fairly cheap

00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:53,910
so we don't want to discourage anyone to

00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:56,220
think that you need a huge amount of

00:25:53,910 --> 00:25:58,530
resources and huge amount of funding to

00:25:56,220 --> 00:26:03,240
pull off any events you can do something

00:25:58,530 --> 00:26:04,890
small you can do something free and you

00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:06,600
know you just need to tell that for your

00:26:04,890 --> 00:26:09,500
local group but if you start getting

00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:11,250
into larger events multi-day events

00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:13,020
you're gonna have to start worrying

00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:14,910
about money locations cost money

00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:16,890
catering costs money there's a lot of

00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:20,190
things to consider so you have to figure

00:26:16,890 --> 00:26:22,710
out some funding sources look for local

00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:25,130
sponsors if there are any Drupal

00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:28,620
agencies or web agencies in your area

00:26:25,130 --> 00:26:32,370
they are probably willing to give you

00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:36,000
some sponsor money they like to help out

00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:38,160
they like to give people money for

00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,950
Sprint's because they appreciate the

00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:43,980
cause and are willing to have these

00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:46,289
and they can do things like let you use

00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:47,909
their office as your venue for free so

00:26:46,289 --> 00:26:50,460
that's a great way for them to give back

00:26:47,909 --> 00:26:52,260
but usually a small amount of money

00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:54,149
maybe one or two hundred dollars it's

00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:56,880
not a big deal for an agency and that

00:26:54,149 --> 00:26:58,409
might help you out a lot but if you're

00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:01,610
going to try to get a lot of sponsors

00:26:58,409 --> 00:27:04,230
for your big event you need visibility

00:27:01,610 --> 00:27:06,090
you have to have a website you have to

00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:09,210
have a social media presence you have to

00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:12,240
have a way to publicize the sponsors if

00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:14,909
you don't have that you're not going to

00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:16,950
be able to get a lot of sponsorship so

00:27:14,909 --> 00:27:18,269
keep that in mind if it's not something

00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:22,080
you think you're going to be able to do

00:27:18,269 --> 00:27:26,669
you probably shouldn't try to host too

00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:27,840
large of an event so i would say the

00:27:26,669 --> 00:27:29,669
first thing if you've never done this

00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:31,200
before you've never contacted sponsors

00:27:29,669 --> 00:27:34,500
is to talk to the drupal association

00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:37,380
they know exactly how to do this all

00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:39,120
right the DA close a lot of events they

00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:40,860
know all the sponsors they know all the

00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:44,130
triple agencies they know who the

00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:45,990
contact is for each one of them so talk

00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:48,299
to them they can help you find out who's

00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:50,730
in your area who might be a good person

00:27:48,299 --> 00:27:54,240
to talk to and get the ball rolling for

00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:56,370
you also talk to the DA about the

00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:59,850
cultivation grants this is something

00:27:56,370 --> 00:28:01,289
that they've given out for a long time I

00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:03,240
don't remember exactly how much it is

00:28:01,289 --> 00:28:10,350
Lauren do you know how much the grants

00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:13,620
are no um i believe i believe about a

00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:18,029
thousand 750 a thousand depending on uh

00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:23,490
you know what the ask is for oh that's

00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:25,889
gone up so I think when I wrong I my

00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:28,169
domain the decision it's a it's a

00:28:25,889 --> 00:28:30,330
community-led group that makes a

00:28:28,169 --> 00:28:33,570
decision in rewards the amount but um I

00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:36,570
okay i think i saw 751 times but the

00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:38,700
point being talked to the DA about that

00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:41,630
because that is money that they will

00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:45,059
give you and you can use for start-up

00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:47,039
when we first ran drupalcamp new jersey

00:28:45,059 --> 00:28:49,559
that was the first thing that we did we

00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:51,120
got money from the DEA and we were able

00:28:49,559 --> 00:28:53,610
to use that for things that we needed

00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:54,690
right away like down payments for

00:28:53,610 --> 00:28:56,820
keyring

00:28:54,690 --> 00:28:59,460
venues and different things like that I

00:28:56,820 --> 00:29:01,920
don't encourage you to spend money out

00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:03,720
of your own pocket find a way to get

00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:05,280
some funding resources so that you don't

00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:07,260
have to do this this shouldn't your

00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:08,790
organizing so it shouldn't be huge

00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:11,970
burden on you try to find some other

00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:16,710
sources for that income and talk to your

00:29:11,970 --> 00:29:18,720
venues if you have to rent a space talk

00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:20,910
to the people who are running that venue

00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:23,850
you might be able to get discounts or

00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:25,590
even get it for free and you might have

00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:27,660
to talk to them about it to do it they

00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:29,880
may not list that information on their

00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:32,400
website or whatever place that you to

00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:35,550
the right day I we've done this with

00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:37,860
libraries where you can rent a library

00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:39,450
space and it might have a small fee some

00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:41,700
of them are more expensive might cost a

00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:44,160
hundred dollars a day but if you talk to

00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:47,280
the library they may know that you're a

00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:48,750
non-profit you're a tech group you're in

00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:50,880
pooping source group and they might

00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:53,700
sponsor you and let you use the venue

00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:55,260
for free or at a discount so definitely

00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:57,600
talk to them first about it don't just

00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:59,460
assume that the cost listed on a website

00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:02,520
somewhere is exactly what the cost is

00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:04,170
going to be and then if your your budget

00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:06,990
is tight and you don't have a lot of

00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:09,030
funding sources be careful about what

00:30:06,990 --> 00:30:11,640
you spend your money on and worry about

00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:13,080
the things that you have to have not

00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:16,470
just things that you think are going to

00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:19,890
be fun so your venue is one of the most

00:30:16,470 --> 00:30:22,260
important things if you need to spend

00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:25,320
extra money to get a better venue and

00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:28,800
then not pay for something else I would

00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:33,260
do that so you don't need t-shirts you

00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:36,990
don't need stickers don't have to have

00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:39,930
more coffee or the fancier food option

00:30:36,990 --> 00:30:41,910
or you know different things you don't

00:30:39,930 --> 00:30:43,680
have badges and lanyards and things like

00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:45,600
that you need to worry about the

00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:48,810
sprinted stealth and make sure thats

00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:51,180
pretty successful first and foremost so

00:30:48,810 --> 00:30:52,950
if getting a better venue means you cut

00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:57,450
out something else I would probably do

00:30:52,950 --> 00:31:02,760
that and then of course be transparent

00:30:57,450 --> 00:31:04,890
uh-huh this is all nonprofit people in

00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:06,360
your local community might be interested

00:31:04,890 --> 00:31:08,010
in where the money's coming from and how

00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:09,020
to be expensed the DA might be

00:31:08,010 --> 00:31:12,120
interested in

00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:14,390
so just share it with them this protects

00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:17,549
everyone else but it also protects you

00:31:14,390 --> 00:31:19,710
so the more people that see the finances

00:31:17,549 --> 00:31:21,570
the better off you're going to be you

00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:23,960
might make a mistake in your counting

00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:26,460
you might get overcharged for something

00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:28,650
and you may not realize it if you're not

00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:30,660
experienced percent fun delaying budgets

00:31:28,650 --> 00:31:33,510
and finances but if somebody else sees

00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:35,670
that that's a mistake that they can help

00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:38,970
you correct so just be very transparent

00:31:35,670 --> 00:31:43,350
clear about it and lastly if you really

00:31:38,970 --> 00:31:46,530
have to don't be afraid to charge up

00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:49,020
tickets to your bet we've seen that four

00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:51,210
camps obviously but sometimes we

00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:53,280
actually reach our tickets for attending

00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:56,520
a sprint as well if we just need the

00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:58,500
money to handle catering or something

00:31:56,520 --> 00:32:00,710
like that it's not a big deal especially

00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:03,059
if you're dealing with a small amount

00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:05,700
ten or twenty dollars or something like

00:32:03,059 --> 00:32:09,120
that it makes it easier to coordinate

00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:10,470
food instead of having 20 people try to

00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:13,260
pull out whatever money they have a

00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:15,510
pocket go get lunch or something like

00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:17,400
that if basically those people give you

00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:19,730
the money ahead of time you can arrange

00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:24,900
the catering and just have everything

00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:29,820
and charging tickets is actually a way

00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:31,559
to manager and those so if you just have

00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:33,179
a free event and you say hey anybody

00:32:31,559 --> 00:32:34,380
wants to come can just come you don't

00:32:33,179 --> 00:32:37,169
really have a good idea if we're going

00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:39,360
to show up but if you actually set up

00:32:37,169 --> 00:32:40,980
tickets for the event and have people

00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:43,320
pay for them you're essentially having

00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:45,510
the register can give you money it's a

00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:47,429
little more formal and those people that

00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:55,250
actually go to the process or a lot more

00:32:47,429 --> 00:32:57,660
likely to actually pretended absolutely

00:32:55,250 --> 00:33:01,640
it's really hard to plan things when you

00:32:57,660 --> 00:33:01,640
don't know who is going to show up

00:33:03,290 --> 00:33:06,000
alright so

00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:07,980
now we're going to get past the

00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:11,520
logistics part of things and talk about

00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:15,050
the event itself and the audience is

00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:18,810
really your attendees right so this is

00:33:15,050 --> 00:33:21,480
incredibly important you need to think

00:33:18,810 --> 00:33:23,370
carefully a balance of the events that

00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:25,710
you're trying to organize and make sure

00:33:23,370 --> 00:33:28,860
that it's tailored for the people who

00:33:25,710 --> 00:33:31,350
are attending right you are running it

00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:33,840
for that right so if you have a local

00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:35,970
community and you want to run a sprint

00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:37,440
for those people you have to know who

00:33:35,970 --> 00:33:38,490
those people are if you know what

00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:41,130
they're interested in with their

00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:42,270
experience level is what things are

00:33:41,130 --> 00:33:44,430
familiar with and what they're not

00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:46,260
familiar with it and make sure that your

00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:48,630
event is geared towards them if you

00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:51,900
don't have a lot of experience people

00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:53,760
then having a highly focused sprint is

00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:56,190
probably not right for that and they're

00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:57,810
probably less likely to show up but if

00:33:56,190 --> 00:33:59,700
you hold a general Sprint's where it's

00:33:57,810 --> 00:34:02,520
more about mentoring and getting people

00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:05,850
started and you have a lot of exercises

00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:08,399
and organization around new people

00:34:05,850 --> 00:34:09,300
getting acclimated they're going to

00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:10,500
think it's more fun they're going to

00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:13,200
show up they're going to learn a lot of

00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:16,200
things if you have a lot of people who

00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:18,360
aren't developers don't have just a

00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:22,620
developer only sprints work on

00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:27,060
documentation work on organization work

00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:28,890
on you know tasks that are great for new

00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:30,690
people like doing some of the issue

00:34:28,890 --> 00:34:33,360
queue triage and you know different

00:34:30,690 --> 00:34:35,159
things like that and just teaching

00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:37,110
people new things those people are going

00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:41,090
to show up if they see that the event

00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:45,480
matches what they're interested in to

00:34:41,090 --> 00:34:48,179
and think about the kind of event you're

00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:50,700
running and who you want to communicate

00:34:48,179 --> 00:34:53,640
that to so if you're running a one-day

00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:55,169
event that is not an event that's geared

00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:57,000
towards people who are traveling a long

00:34:55,169 --> 00:34:59,070
distance so don't try to communicate

00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:01,620
with them or try to recruit those people

00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:04,770
to show up if someone's coming from out

00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:07,920
of town from several hours away or they

00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:09,930
a flight away your event really needs to

00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:14,310
be at least two or three days long at

00:35:09,930 --> 00:35:17,010
least no one wants to fly in stay at a

00:35:14,310 --> 00:35:18,270
hotel you know do everything associated

00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:20,480
with

00:35:18,270 --> 00:35:23,880
time off work or arranging for

00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:25,560
babysitters or the like to come in for

00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:28,200
like a six hour of that that doesn't

00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:30,360
make sense they're not going to come so

00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:32,400
don't gear your communications to them

00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:34,350
he write your communications and the

00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:49,350
topic of your events to the people that

00:35:34,350 --> 00:35:52,850
are local if you are having an event a

00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:56,190
sprint where your target audience is

00:35:52,850 --> 00:36:01,200
people who have not yet contributed and

00:35:56,190 --> 00:36:06,690
you want to introduce contributing to

00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:11,700
them you can expect that you'll have a

00:36:06,690 --> 00:36:14,640
bunch of setup time and need to plan for

00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:19,400
that so if you have a one-day event and

00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:22,650
it's geared towards new contributors

00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:27,360
you'll spend probably about half of your

00:36:22,650 --> 00:36:30,560
day getting people oriented as to what a

00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:36,960
sprint is like and getting them ready to

00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:42,890
work on issues um you can mitigate that

00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:46,020
a little bit by having a repeat event so

00:36:42,890 --> 00:36:50,420
one of the things we do in my local

00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:55,260
community is we have a monthly sprint um

00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:57,480
so we get people coming back over and

00:36:55,260 --> 00:37:00,450
over again we don't have to have a four

00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:02,940
day long event it's more reasonable we

00:37:00,450 --> 00:37:06,990
have a half day event but we have it

00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:10,110
every month so that set-up time happens

00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:13,110
once and then people come back at to the

00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:16,490
next thing and they aren't more ready to

00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:21,450
go if you're only going to have a sprint

00:37:16,490 --> 00:37:26,210
once it can be really advantageous to

00:37:21,450 --> 00:37:26,210
have it be a multi-day thing

00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:37,620
um the day that you have it depends on

00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:40,410
pawn who you're trying to attract um so

00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:43,830
it might be on a weekend which is

00:37:40,410 --> 00:37:49,790
typically not a workday for people or it

00:37:43,830 --> 00:37:53,100
could be on on Monday or Friday and

00:37:49,790 --> 00:37:59,880
people might be able to convince their

00:37:53,100 --> 00:38:03,290
employers to send them it's tricky when

00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:03,290
we're doing something like this because

00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:15,240
not everybody has free time to come to

00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:17,850
an event and I think we need to think we

00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:20,580
need to be thoughtful when we're

00:38:17,850 --> 00:38:25,500
planning something about who we're

00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:27,650
trying to attract and whether or not

00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:33,300
they can attend the event on their own

00:38:27,650 --> 00:38:35,760
cost and it's okay to allocate part of

00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:41,910
your budget to actually paying somebody

00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:47,520
to attend a sprint this helps a lot in

00:38:41,910 --> 00:38:51,180
terms of diversity in our open source

00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:54,240
projects if we have some money set aside

00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:57,090
from that because if we don't do that

00:38:54,240 --> 00:39:02,430
what we get are only the people who can

00:38:57,090 --> 00:39:05,640
afford to fund themselves to both attend

00:39:02,430 --> 00:39:09,570
in terms of travel and also spend the

00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:12,360
time at the event so the audience thing

00:39:09,570 --> 00:39:15,950
relates back to the funding thing

00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:19,620
especially in terms of thinking about

00:39:15,950 --> 00:39:22,070
having a diverse set of people who can

00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:22,070
be there

00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:33,730
there's a thing in the Drupal community

00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:36,640
which is really makes me smile which is

00:39:33,730 --> 00:39:43,540
that we have this thing called mentoring

00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:44,350
that that happens at sprints and so one

00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:47,080
of the things you want to think about

00:39:44,350 --> 00:39:50,020
when you're planning a sprint is a do

00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:54,730
you need any mentors and how many do you

00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:56,650
need and that depends upon the target

00:39:54,730 --> 00:40:01,840
audience of your sprint who's attending

00:39:56,650 --> 00:40:05,830
and also who those mentors are so if

00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:09,340
you're having a small sprint and it's

00:40:05,830 --> 00:40:12,370
focused on a topic your mentor is

00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:14,530
probably just going to be the person who

00:40:12,370 --> 00:40:17,440
has experience in that topic they're

00:40:14,530 --> 00:40:19,840
going to be the lead for your sprint and

00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:24,400
that will happen very organically

00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:27,700
especially if you have a small event but

00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:31,540
if you're having something larger I you

00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:34,840
can plan on having uh you can plan to

00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:38,760
need to have a few people who are not

00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:43,420
going to be doing the work working on

00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:45,190
issues and improving Drupal themselves

00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:47,820
but who are going to dedicate their time

00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:51,040
at the event to helping other people

00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:54,700
figure out how to get things

00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:56,980
accomplished in the project if your

00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:59,650
mentors are experienced they can

00:40:56,980 --> 00:41:03,220
probably help eight people throughout

00:40:59,650 --> 00:41:06,520
the day if your mentors are new then

00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:08,080
they are going to need you're going to

00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:13,090
need more mentors because they're going

00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:22,680
to focus on fewer people throughout the

00:41:13,090 --> 00:41:24,940
day um it's really important to have

00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:28,000
anybody whether it's an official mentor

00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:29,950
or in a grant or organic thing to make

00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:32,200
sure that people are working together

00:41:29,950 --> 00:41:34,570
and then the mentoring happens

00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:38,440
automatically if you do have a big event

00:41:34,570 --> 00:41:39,369
though it's nice to ask for people to

00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:41,650
sign up to mentor

00:41:39,369 --> 00:41:45,309
in advance and also have a way to

00:41:41,650 --> 00:41:49,779
identify who the mentors are different

00:41:45,309 --> 00:41:53,950
colored t-shirts are nice or certain

00:41:49,779 --> 00:41:55,930
kinds of badges so you people know they

00:41:53,950 --> 00:41:58,480
can go up to this person and they can

00:41:55,930 --> 00:42:02,200
ask for something and get the

00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:04,150
information that they need and I'm big

00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:06,660
on the one-on-one mentoring especially

00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:09,789
for smaller local events I think it's

00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:12,249
when people get started and they've

00:42:09,789 --> 00:42:13,720
never contributed before they are having

00:42:12,249 --> 00:42:15,130
trouble with their local development

00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:17,380
environment things like that it can be

00:42:15,130 --> 00:42:18,999
really frustrating experience and it's

00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:21,670
really nice for those people when they

00:42:18,999 --> 00:42:23,079
have that one person who just sits next

00:42:21,670 --> 00:42:24,849
to them and helps them the whole time

00:42:23,079 --> 00:42:26,980
that they're there make sure that they

00:42:24,849 --> 00:42:29,319
solve all the problems that they have it

00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:30,880
creates a really great experience from a

00:42:29,319 --> 00:42:35,200
person and they're more likely to come

00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:37,900
back when we're talking about these

00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:41,349
Sprint's we are talking about in-person

00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:45,789
events so the whole point is that we get

00:42:41,349 --> 00:42:48,999
together in person and so when we do

00:42:45,789 --> 00:42:51,970
that working together really is what

00:42:48,999 --> 00:42:54,910
makes these things shine Cathy we have a

00:42:51,970 --> 00:42:57,009
question really quick um do you look for

00:42:54,910 --> 00:43:06,549
any multiplications for an efficient or

00:42:57,009 --> 00:43:08,019
oh that's interesting um well one thing

00:43:06,549 --> 00:43:14,319
I would say make sure that the mentor

00:43:08,019 --> 00:43:16,539
wants to do it sometime I say something

00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:18,039
you go to an event and new people show

00:43:16,539 --> 00:43:20,710
up in the go oh why don't you just talk

00:43:18,039 --> 00:43:22,059
to jet out like you like help you work

00:43:20,710 --> 00:43:23,650
your that problem well make sure that

00:43:22,059 --> 00:43:25,839
Joe actually wants to do that first and

00:43:23,650 --> 00:43:27,099
that he doesn't think he's just there to

00:43:25,839 --> 00:43:29,559
sprint and doesn't want to be bothered

00:43:27,099 --> 00:43:33,609
or something like that so enthusiasm

00:43:29,559 --> 00:43:35,529
definitely helps in wanting helps yeah

00:43:33,609 --> 00:43:37,869
setting up expectations ahead of time

00:43:35,529 --> 00:43:40,299
both for people who are attending may be

00:43:37,869 --> 00:43:42,960
their first sprint and also for people

00:43:40,299 --> 00:43:49,720
who are attending their twentieth sprint

00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:53,319
is really good and qualifications I are

00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:58,170
really quite low though in terms of who

00:43:53,319 --> 00:44:01,930
mentor and who can't because if you have

00:43:58,170 --> 00:44:06,999
love well let's for example let's take

00:44:01,930 --> 00:44:10,109
drupalcon so triple con we have a sprint

00:44:06,999 --> 00:44:13,749
day which is get involved with core and

00:44:10,109 --> 00:44:15,699
so our expectations for people who

00:44:13,749 --> 00:44:18,880
mentor during that day are that they

00:44:15,699 --> 00:44:24,309
have previous experience working on core

00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:28,920
and we will have mentors that maybe have

00:44:24,309 --> 00:44:34,359
worked on three ish three core issues or

00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:37,859
300 core issues and and any of those

00:44:34,359 --> 00:44:40,779
people are going to be valuable mentors

00:44:37,859 --> 00:44:42,940
because the person who's worked on three

00:44:40,779 --> 00:44:44,829
core issues can help somebody work on

00:44:42,940 --> 00:44:46,660
something for their first time because

00:44:44,829 --> 00:44:49,119
they've done it before they know the

00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:52,569
basic things the person who's worked on

00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:55,410
300 core issues will help somebody else

00:44:52,569 --> 00:45:01,390
who maybe is more in the weeds of

00:44:55,410 --> 00:45:05,380
something some difficult problem so I i

00:45:01,390 --> 00:45:08,079
think the qualifications for mentors are

00:45:05,380 --> 00:45:09,519
around their expectations they really

00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:12,190
need to be able to devote their time

00:45:09,519 --> 00:45:14,380
while their mentoring to not

00:45:12,190 --> 00:45:17,799
accomplishing anything themselves and

00:45:14,380 --> 00:45:21,279
understand that their job is to help

00:45:17,799 --> 00:45:23,589
other people accomplish things and if

00:45:21,279 --> 00:45:27,430
they have those expectations and a

00:45:23,589 --> 00:45:29,079
little bit of experience in the area of

00:45:27,430 --> 00:45:33,849
the sprint then things are going to work

00:45:29,079 --> 00:45:36,369
out fine and we do not turn away mentors

00:45:33,849 --> 00:45:39,039
at drupalcon you can sign up to mentor

00:45:36,369 --> 00:45:43,660
and I'm like great you're you're on the

00:45:39,039 --> 00:45:47,529
team yeah that the only real

00:45:43,660 --> 00:45:49,509
qualification is just experience working

00:45:47,529 --> 00:45:50,769
in the issue queues and experience

00:45:49,509 --> 00:45:53,319
contributing because that's what you're

00:45:50,769 --> 00:45:57,160
mentoring on you don't need to have

00:45:53,319 --> 00:45:58,839
expertise in the software so you're not

00:45:57,160 --> 00:46:00,759
necessarily there to answer every

00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:03,069
technical question that people have

00:46:00,759 --> 00:46:05,469
you're there to help them get started

00:46:03,069 --> 00:46:06,400
and navigate ishik you use drupal upward

00:46:05,469 --> 00:46:07,930
on

00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:12,069
stand where the tools are things like

00:46:07,930 --> 00:46:14,140
that yeah so for example if I'm at an

00:46:12,069 --> 00:46:17,410
event and somebody asked me a question

00:46:14,140 --> 00:46:20,230
about twig I don't know anything about

00:46:17,410 --> 00:46:24,910
it but that doesn't mean I can't mentor

00:46:20,230 --> 00:46:27,279
them at the sprint and help them work on

00:46:24,910 --> 00:46:30,010
an issue about that because my job as a

00:46:27,279 --> 00:46:33,700
mentor is really to expose to this

00:46:30,010 --> 00:46:36,039
person how to do the work and how to

00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:38,500
find out answers to their questions I

00:46:36,039 --> 00:46:41,440
don't actually need to know answers to

00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:44,529
their questions I just need to show them

00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:46,210
how they can find out the answers to

00:46:44,529 --> 00:46:49,960
their questions that's much more

00:46:46,210 --> 00:46:52,930
empowering and prepares that person to

00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:55,359
continue to contribute even after the

00:46:52,930 --> 00:46:58,150
event if they can know how you find out

00:46:55,359 --> 00:47:00,880
things not just the answers to things

00:46:58,150 --> 00:47:03,099
that they have questions about yeah it's

00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:05,500
also good to communicate that to the

00:47:03,099 --> 00:47:07,720
people who are attending because you get

00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:09,579
people that will show up and expect that

00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:11,710
the mentors are there to help them with

00:47:09,579 --> 00:47:13,660
a project or answer all their drupal

00:47:11,710 --> 00:47:16,059
questions and things like that and then

00:47:13,660 --> 00:47:18,730
they may get frustrated like what your

00:47:16,059 --> 00:47:20,710
mentor why are you not you know able to

00:47:18,730 --> 00:47:22,270
solve all my technical problems but

00:47:20,710 --> 00:47:24,299
they're not there for that so make sure

00:47:22,270 --> 00:47:27,309
people understand that before they come

00:47:24,299 --> 00:47:29,799
is there a really quick is there a pro

00:47:27,309 --> 00:47:32,700
tip you guys have in the past on how to

00:47:29,799 --> 00:47:38,109
identify your mentors to the general

00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:40,150
attendees at your sprint at a small

00:47:38,109 --> 00:47:42,010
event at the beginning of the day I

00:47:40,150 --> 00:47:46,450
would just have people stand up and say

00:47:42,010 --> 00:47:49,359
hey this is Sally you know there they

00:47:46,450 --> 00:47:55,720
can help you with whatever questions you

00:47:49,359 --> 00:47:58,119
have at big events um uh if you can plan

00:47:55,720 --> 00:48:00,730
in advance a special colored t-shirt

00:47:58,119 --> 00:48:03,490
actually helps uh but if you can't do

00:48:00,730 --> 00:48:05,440
that just any kind of like I'd like

00:48:03,490 --> 00:48:08,589
throw a sticker on somebody's shoulder

00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:10,630
and and so they can walk around with

00:48:08,589 --> 00:48:13,660
that throughout the day yeah you guys

00:48:10,630 --> 00:48:16,059
didn't look Bogota right yeah that that

00:48:13,660 --> 00:48:20,280
was really good and what we what we did

00:48:16,059 --> 00:48:24,850
and is we Bogota hand

00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:28,570
like 270 people at the event and we had

00:48:24,850 --> 00:48:30,640
101 people at the sprint we have a ton

00:48:28,570 --> 00:48:33,520
of people at the sprint and we didn't

00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:36,390
have special bright yellow t-shirts or

00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:41,800
anything like that what we had was um

00:48:36,390 --> 00:48:44,500
black t-shirts and and we had a pile of

00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:45,820
them that Bluehost provided they had

00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:47,110
just brought a bunch of t-shirts and

00:48:45,820 --> 00:48:50,050
they just happened to all be a dark

00:48:47,110 --> 00:48:52,060
color other people are already wearing a

00:48:50,050 --> 00:48:53,710
dark colored shirt that day but we did

00:48:52,060 --> 00:48:57,040
was we sent somebody out the day before

00:48:53,710 --> 00:49:01,420
to the local like hardware store and

00:48:57,040 --> 00:49:03,130
they bought a a bright colored tape so

00:49:01,420 --> 00:49:06,490
we had green tape so we just put like

00:49:03,130 --> 00:49:09,040
stripes on the backs of people's black

00:49:06,490 --> 00:49:12,550
t-shirts and they were bright green and

00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:15,040
then you knew throughout the day so it's

00:49:12,550 --> 00:49:19,300
I think having some kind of identifying

00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:21,970
simple on people um helps reduce the

00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:24,070
barrier it makes people more likely when

00:49:21,970 --> 00:49:26,380
they have a question to be willing to

00:49:24,070 --> 00:49:28,960
ask it because they're like oh that's

00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:31,540
what this person is for her I'm supposed

00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:36,880
to ask them all the things and it just

00:49:31,540 --> 00:49:39,640
it reduces that friction and it makes

00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:43,560
people much more willing to ask things

00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:49,060
they might be a little reluctant to ask

00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:51,820
awesome that's great when running your

00:49:49,060 --> 00:49:55,450
Sprint's make sure that you have goals

00:49:51,820 --> 00:49:57,850
right you you're not going to be very

00:49:55,450 --> 00:49:59,350
successful if you decide to run an event

00:49:57,850 --> 00:50:01,270
and you say well we're just we're going

00:49:59,350 --> 00:50:02,800
to handle all these things or venue the

00:50:01,270 --> 00:50:04,300
catering all the source stuff and then

00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:06,100
everyone will just come and we'll just

00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:08,530
sit around and we'll just do stuff with

00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:10,240
what stuff are you going to do right you

00:50:08,530 --> 00:50:12,190
need to figure out exactly how your

00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:13,960
events going to go are you going to have

00:50:12,190 --> 00:50:16,270
mentoring or not if you are going to

00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:18,010
have mentoring figure out what the goals

00:50:16,270 --> 00:50:21,130
are for the mentoring right make sure

00:50:18,010 --> 00:50:25,690
that people have accomplishments if it's

00:50:21,130 --> 00:50:27,100
a focus sprint make sure that you're

00:50:25,690 --> 00:50:29,800
focused on it and you're working on

00:50:27,100 --> 00:50:32,040
issues specific for that but manage

00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:33,619
those expectations don't think that

00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:35,390
you're going to run

00:50:33,619 --> 00:50:37,130
sprint and everyone's going to work on

00:50:35,390 --> 00:50:39,109
everything and you're going to solve all

00:50:37,130 --> 00:50:41,269
the problems in the world right that's

00:50:39,109 --> 00:50:46,640
not going to happen it's never going to

00:50:41,269 --> 00:50:49,220
happen so keep it simpler know what

00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:52,730
makes sense and for me what makes sense

00:50:49,220 --> 00:50:56,150
is making sure that everyone who comes

00:50:52,730 --> 00:50:57,920
to your event accomplishes something no

00:50:56,150 --> 00:51:01,130
matter what that is so an experienced

00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:03,589
person might just work on one issue and

00:51:01,130 --> 00:51:07,069
get it solved and for them that's a

00:51:03,589 --> 00:51:08,900
success for someone who's brand new they

00:51:07,069 --> 00:51:11,210
may just go through the mentoring

00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:13,730
process and get used to all the tools

00:51:11,210 --> 00:51:15,940
get their laptop setup and at the end of

00:51:13,730 --> 00:51:18,650
the day comment on one or two issues

00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:20,930
made me write a patch and upload it and

00:51:18,650 --> 00:51:22,819
that's it but they at least get to that

00:51:20,930 --> 00:51:25,130
point where they've done something make

00:51:22,819 --> 00:51:27,259
sure every single person at your sprint

00:51:25,130 --> 00:51:28,999
has an experience like that if that

00:51:27,259 --> 00:51:30,950
happens they'll feel good about it and

00:51:28,999 --> 00:51:33,589
they're more likely to come back right

00:51:30,950 --> 00:51:35,240
so this is where it's an important to

00:51:33,589 --> 00:51:37,490
communicate your type of event to

00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:40,460
everyone so they understand what they're

00:51:37,490 --> 00:51:42,349
getting involved with re so that if the

00:51:40,460 --> 00:51:45,559
event is not right for them they won't

00:51:42,349 --> 00:51:47,029
attend the event which is okay but if

00:51:45,559 --> 00:51:49,940
they attend the event with different

00:51:47,029 --> 00:51:52,150
expectations than what you had that's

00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:55,700
when they're gonna have a bad time

00:51:52,150 --> 00:51:57,950
mm-hmm and when I say don't do it all I

00:51:55,700 --> 00:52:00,319
don't just refer to the sprint itself

00:51:57,950 --> 00:52:03,890
I'm referring to you as the organizer

00:52:00,319 --> 00:52:06,349
right don't try to organize a big sprint

00:52:03,890 --> 00:52:09,289
by yourself handle the venue handle all

00:52:06,349 --> 00:52:11,029
the catering do the mentoring think

00:52:09,289 --> 00:52:13,849
you're also going to do sprinting as

00:52:11,029 --> 00:52:15,140
well it's just not going to work if

00:52:13,849 --> 00:52:17,299
you're large enough that you need

00:52:15,140 --> 00:52:19,069
multiple people to volunteer get

00:52:17,299 --> 00:52:21,980
multiple volunteers have people

00:52:19,069 --> 00:52:24,140
concentrate on their particular tasks

00:52:21,980 --> 00:52:25,880
and just worry about doing that task and

00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:28,099
doing it well so if you're mentoring

00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:30,289
just mentor don't worry about sprinting

00:52:28,099 --> 00:52:31,819
if you were just handling the catering

00:52:30,289 --> 00:52:37,519
just handle the cannery and make sure

00:52:31,819 --> 00:52:41,420
that all works well yeah i would i would

00:52:37,519 --> 00:52:45,920
say that if part of your goal of your

00:52:41,420 --> 00:52:47,420
sprint is includes new people the the

00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:51,619
most difficult thing to

00:52:47,420 --> 00:52:55,359
accomplished is having people click save

00:52:51,619 --> 00:52:58,640
on their comment on an issue and

00:52:55,359 --> 00:53:00,650
encouraging them to do that will give

00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:04,040
them a result that they can look back on

00:53:00,650 --> 00:53:06,980
and say yes I did something so helping

00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:10,460
people do that is really good if if if

00:53:06,980 --> 00:53:15,950
you're having a sprint for encouraging

00:53:10,460 --> 00:53:20,660
people to start contributing beef for

00:53:15,950 --> 00:53:23,750
the Sprint and it's a lot of work for

00:53:20,660 --> 00:53:26,690
the organizer so the organizer of the

00:53:23,750 --> 00:53:29,150
sprint might want to pick a different

00:53:26,690 --> 00:53:32,470
person to specifically handle this but

00:53:29,150 --> 00:53:35,210
it is really important to go through

00:53:32,470 --> 00:53:37,760
whatever kind of project you have and

00:53:35,210 --> 00:53:41,420
pick out some issues that are going to

00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:44,720
be good to work on the next day or that

00:53:41,420 --> 00:53:48,349
weekend and the other thing that's

00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:52,040
important to do beforehand is remind

00:53:48,349 --> 00:53:54,500
people of all the logistics tell them

00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:56,780
you know come this is what you need to

00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:58,579
bring this is what you should wear this

00:53:56,780 --> 00:54:01,040
is how to get to it like all of the

00:53:58,579 --> 00:54:03,109
reminders you cannot communicate too

00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:08,210
much in advance it really makes for a

00:54:03,109 --> 00:54:11,950
much better event if you're having a

00:54:08,210 --> 00:54:14,000
large sprint you will need to warn

00:54:11,950 --> 00:54:16,400
freenode that you're going to have a

00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:20,359
bunch of people connecting on IRC from

00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:23,420
the same ip address if you're having a

00:54:20,359 --> 00:54:25,760
large sprint you need to warn the drupal

00:54:23,420 --> 00:54:29,329
association so they can make sure that

00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:36,079
the there are enough test spots up to

00:54:29,329 --> 00:54:37,730
handle the amount of patches that are

00:54:36,079 --> 00:54:42,650
going to be coming up in the queue and

00:54:37,730 --> 00:54:45,470
the contact information for who to to

00:54:42,650 --> 00:54:47,359
tell about those things is in the one

00:54:45,470 --> 00:54:49,880
have a link for that for you at the end

00:54:47,359 --> 00:54:53,420
but you want to do that a couple of days

00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:55,549
beforehand use whatever tool you are

00:54:53,420 --> 00:54:59,119
comfortable with that people will have

00:54:55,549 --> 00:55:01,190
access to a for looking at what issues

00:54:59,119 --> 00:55:12,680
you're going to work on

00:55:01,190 --> 00:55:15,369
so if you're leading a a contributor for

00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:21,069
you might tag issues with the upcoming

00:55:15,369 --> 00:55:21,069
sprint thing and if you're not a

00:55:21,220 --> 00:55:25,160
maintainer of a specific thing then

00:55:23,839 --> 00:55:28,550
you're not going to use tags you're

00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:32,119
going to just make a google doc and put

00:55:28,550 --> 00:55:34,640
a bunch of issue links in them or you're

00:55:32,119 --> 00:55:37,339
gonna make a Trello board and keep that

00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:39,200
up to date use whatever tools you want

00:55:37,339 --> 00:55:43,010
but you definitely want to pick out the

00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:45,440
issues to focus on in advance yeah if

00:55:43,010 --> 00:55:49,880
you're exotic new people to come it's

00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:51,890
really handy to have one or two really

00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:53,869
simple tasks that you know need to get

00:55:51,890 --> 00:55:55,750
done that you could do really quick

00:55:53,869 --> 00:55:57,920
yourself but just hold on to them like

00:55:55,750 --> 00:55:59,720
running a change record or doing an

00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:01,220
issue somewhere update or like something

00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:02,390
like that so like you know when there's

00:56:01,220 --> 00:56:04,670
someone new without walking to the door

00:56:02,390 --> 00:56:06,500
like okay I can give this specific thing

00:56:04,670 --> 00:56:07,940
to you I don't have to spend a half an

00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:15,020
hour trying to find an issue for you to

00:56:07,940 --> 00:56:18,619
work on when um when you're actually at

00:56:15,020 --> 00:56:21,710
the event the main benefit that we have

00:56:18,619 --> 00:56:24,530
is that we're all in the same place so

00:56:21,710 --> 00:56:28,130
we might as well work together and I

00:56:24,530 --> 00:56:31,700
think it's a difficult to maybe explain

00:56:28,130 --> 00:56:34,550
to your boss or the person who's funding

00:56:31,700 --> 00:56:37,790
the event but it is not important how

00:56:34,550 --> 00:56:41,720
many patches are put on how many issues

00:56:37,790 --> 00:56:44,720
the important outcome that we have is

00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:50,660
working together and moving a very small

00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:53,240
set of issues further and so doing

00:56:50,660 --> 00:56:56,540
reviews is really important to do at a

00:56:53,240 --> 00:56:58,099
sprint and review something multiple

00:56:56,540 --> 00:57:00,319
times throughout the day so that it gets

00:56:58,099 --> 00:57:03,609
closer and closer to what we call Rt bc

00:57:00,319 --> 00:57:08,150
which is reviewed and tested by the

00:57:03,609 --> 00:57:09,950
community and it means that something

00:57:08,150 --> 00:57:12,380
has happened and it's gotten to a

00:57:09,950 --> 00:57:15,180
sufficient point where it can actually

00:57:12,380 --> 00:57:19,140
go into the project like

00:57:15,180 --> 00:57:20,760
issue is done and so adjusting

00:57:19,140 --> 00:57:22,200
expectations of the people who are

00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:24,119
funding it the people who are organizing

00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:27,540
it and the people are who are working on

00:57:24,119 --> 00:57:30,180
it instead of let's do a ton a ton of

00:57:27,540 --> 00:57:33,390
work to let's work on a small amount of

00:57:30,180 --> 00:57:37,890
things but let's get it done is really

00:57:33,390 --> 00:57:39,359
nice and it will not only be good for

00:57:37,890 --> 00:57:42,510
the project but good for the people who

00:57:39,359 --> 00:57:49,500
are working on it to see that their work

00:57:42,510 --> 00:57:51,300
was effective all right and at the

00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:55,530
sprint make sure you document everything

00:57:51,300 --> 00:57:57,569
that you can it's easy to forget it

00:57:55,530 --> 00:58:00,210
while to you to do all the documentation

00:57:57,569 --> 00:58:02,670
while you are there and it might be nice

00:58:00,210 --> 00:58:04,740
to assign that task to another person

00:58:02,670 --> 00:58:07,740
that this is all they do but make sure

00:58:04,740 --> 00:58:09,599
you do things like record all of the

00:58:07,740 --> 00:58:11,670
issues that get worked on at that sprint

00:58:09,599 --> 00:58:13,290
so you can share that information later

00:58:11,670 --> 00:58:14,940
with other people and you can keep track

00:58:13,290 --> 00:58:17,609
of those issues and see that they get

00:58:14,940 --> 00:58:19,200
done and seeing that the work you did at

00:58:17,609 --> 00:58:21,660
the sprint was effective and removing

00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:23,400
all those issues forward take notes

00:58:21,660 --> 00:58:25,770
about what things worked and what didn't

00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:27,180
work and do it during the event or right

00:58:25,770 --> 00:58:30,450
after the event so it's fresh in your

00:58:27,180 --> 00:58:32,160
mind and you know things like okay we

00:58:30,450 --> 00:58:33,750
did have a problem with the doors I need

00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:35,849
a checklist of all the things I have to

00:58:33,750 --> 00:58:38,160
do before the event next time and this

00:58:35,849 --> 00:58:40,950
is what that checklist is or these food

00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:42,660
options didn't work we order coffee we

00:58:40,950 --> 00:58:44,520
actually had too much coffee or we had

00:58:42,660 --> 00:58:46,349
two little coffee so we can adjust our

00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:48,630
budget next time do all those things

00:58:46,349 --> 00:58:50,940
during the event and immediately after

00:58:48,630 --> 00:58:52,680
the event while they're fresh and take

00:58:50,940 --> 00:58:54,750
pictures because you're going to want to

00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:56,549
remember the event you're going to

00:58:54,750 --> 00:58:57,930
remember want to remember who attended

00:58:56,549 --> 00:58:59,130
the event it's easy to look at pictures

00:58:57,930 --> 00:59:01,290
and remember oh that's right those

00:58:59,130 --> 00:59:03,359
people were there and if you're going to

00:59:01,290 --> 00:59:04,920
blog about it afterwards it's nice to

00:59:03,359 --> 00:59:06,599
include the picture so you can show

00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:09,599
everybody how many people were there and

00:59:06,599 --> 00:59:12,210
what a good time you had so go ahead and

00:59:09,599 --> 00:59:14,480
do that but when you're taking pictures

00:59:12,210 --> 00:59:17,460
make sure that you're careful about

00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:18,720
asking for people's permission before

00:59:17,460 --> 00:59:22,140
taking the pictures and posting them

00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:23,250
online a lot of people don't want their

00:59:22,140 --> 00:59:27,680
pictures taken they don't want them

00:59:23,250 --> 00:59:29,270
online just be respectful of that choice

00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:31,670
and usually we don't have too many

00:59:29,270 --> 00:59:33,890
problems one thing that I do sometimes

00:59:31,670 --> 00:59:35,270
is if there's one person in the room or

00:59:33,890 --> 00:59:37,280
a couple people who don't want to have

00:59:35,270 --> 00:59:39,950
their picture taken have them take the

00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:41,450
pictures that's a real nice simple

00:59:39,950 --> 00:59:43,430
solution then you don't have to worry

00:59:41,450 --> 00:59:44,660
about it and Kathy why don't you tell

00:59:43,430 --> 00:59:45,859
them what you guys did at mid camp which

00:59:44,660 --> 00:59:48,740
I thought was actually a really great

00:59:45,859 --> 00:59:51,140
solution so in mid camp we had two

00:59:48,740 --> 00:59:55,309
different color lanyards we had green

00:59:51,140 --> 00:59:58,280
lanyards people could pick if they did

00:59:55,309 --> 01:00:00,740
not want their picture used and blue

00:59:58,280 --> 01:00:04,280
lanyards if they were okay with their

01:00:00,740 --> 01:00:07,460
picture being used and and we also had

01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:09,050
people whose like one task we asked them

01:00:07,460 --> 01:00:12,140
to do was like take a bunch of pictures

01:00:09,050 --> 01:00:14,390
and it was really helpful and there were

01:00:12,140 --> 01:00:16,520
a couple of pictures which I was looking

01:00:14,390 --> 01:00:18,470
at after the event which were posted

01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:20,180
online and I'm like hey there's a person

01:00:18,470 --> 01:00:23,000
in this picture with a green lanyard and

01:00:20,180 --> 01:00:25,339
we took their picture down it was made

01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:30,440
it super easy to know whether or not a

01:00:25,339 --> 01:00:32,780
picture was okay to use a later uh the

01:00:30,440 --> 01:00:37,480
other nice thing to do especially if

01:00:32,780 --> 01:00:40,130
you're having a multi-day event is to

01:00:37,480 --> 01:00:42,440
summarize the work that was done that

01:00:40,130 --> 01:00:45,049
day and put that online for each day of

01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:47,869
this print that happened in New Jersey

01:00:45,049 --> 01:00:51,200
when we did the menu links sprint and it

01:00:47,869 --> 01:00:55,329
happened at the CI sprint that was just

01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:59,569
in Portland and it really helps people

01:00:55,329 --> 01:01:01,339
not like decide to attend the second day

01:00:59,569 --> 01:01:03,770
at the sprint but what it helps them do

01:01:01,339 --> 01:01:07,309
is decide that they're going to attend

01:01:03,770 --> 01:01:10,270
something in the future so publishing a

01:01:07,309 --> 01:01:13,910
wrap up blog post and including pictures

01:01:10,270 --> 01:01:16,400
makes people see what happens so they

01:01:13,910 --> 01:01:18,230
know what a sprint is like and they can

01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:20,690
identify themselves as somebody who

01:01:18,230 --> 01:01:22,760
should attend it in the future so it

01:01:20,690 --> 01:01:25,359
will increase future attendance when you

01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:28,069
do all this really good communication

01:01:25,359 --> 01:01:30,799
yeah any these post write ups are

01:01:28,069 --> 01:01:32,540
actually quite good for letting us all

01:01:30,799 --> 01:01:35,450
understand how effective some of the

01:01:32,540 --> 01:01:37,640
sprints are which is really helpful for

01:01:35,450 --> 01:01:41,470
the community for the project for the DA

01:01:37,640 --> 01:01:41,470
for sponsors for everybody

01:01:42,760 --> 01:01:47,990
okay now last of course for your event

01:01:46,340 --> 01:01:49,940
is to have fun this I actually had to

01:01:47,990 --> 01:01:52,910
add this slide to remind myself to talk

01:01:49,940 --> 01:01:55,430
about this because it's so easy to

01:01:52,910 --> 01:01:57,050
forget that you know these events all

01:01:55,430 --> 01:01:59,660
the events that you're running there

01:01:57,050 --> 01:02:01,760
about the people right you're running a

01:01:59,660 --> 01:02:03,350
sprint or any kind of event because you

01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:06,590
care about your local community and you

01:02:03,350 --> 01:02:08,540
want to run a social event you know so

01:02:06,590 --> 01:02:10,460
make sure that everyone that's there is

01:02:08,540 --> 01:02:11,600
having a pleasant experience make sure

01:02:10,460 --> 01:02:13,130
your attendees have a pleasant

01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:14,870
experience or your volunteers have a

01:02:13,130 --> 01:02:17,140
pleasant experience and that you as an

01:02:14,870 --> 01:02:20,210
organizer or having a good experience

01:02:17,140 --> 01:02:22,400
right don't take on too many

01:02:20,210 --> 01:02:24,410
responsibilities or try to host an event

01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:27,020
that is too big for what you're capable

01:02:24,410 --> 01:02:29,270
of what your resources are we don't want

01:02:27,020 --> 01:02:32,180
you to get too stressed out about it

01:02:29,270 --> 01:02:33,830
right that doesn't make sense if you are

01:02:32,180 --> 01:02:36,050
having too many problems and you think

01:02:33,830 --> 01:02:38,090
it's too much of a burden just scale

01:02:36,050 --> 01:02:40,910
your event back you know ask for help

01:02:38,090 --> 01:02:43,430
get more volunteers but if anything is

01:02:40,910 --> 01:02:46,340
happening either for your attendees or

01:02:43,430 --> 01:02:47,750
your volunteers or organizers it's a

01:02:46,340 --> 01:02:50,210
really a problem that you need to do

01:02:47,750 --> 01:02:52,520
something about right don't burden

01:02:50,210 --> 01:02:55,160
yourself don't create a bad environment

01:02:52,520 --> 01:02:57,410
for your attendees and if any of that is

01:02:55,160 --> 01:03:00,050
happening just ask for help you can talk

01:02:57,410 --> 01:03:03,530
to the DA if you need help you can reach

01:03:00,050 --> 01:03:06,620
out to some of your local mentors and

01:03:03,530 --> 01:03:08,840
experienced contributors reach out to

01:03:06,620 --> 01:03:11,150
the core mentor group the core mentor

01:03:08,840 --> 01:03:12,680
leadership and ask them for advice ask

01:03:11,150 --> 01:03:14,840
them you know what you might have to do

01:03:12,680 --> 01:03:17,240
about certain situations if you need

01:03:14,840 --> 01:03:19,960
conflict resolution talk to the DA and

01:03:17,240 --> 01:03:23,990
if you're really not sure what to do

01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:26,300
find one of us talked to Lauren talk to

01:03:23,990 --> 01:03:29,120
find me or Cathy we both have contact

01:03:26,300 --> 01:03:31,490
forms on our our Google I our profiles

01:03:29,120 --> 01:03:32,690
we're on IRC all the time if you really

01:03:31,490 --> 01:03:34,700
think you need help and you don't know

01:03:32,690 --> 01:03:36,230
where to turn turn to one of us will

01:03:34,700 --> 01:03:39,170
give you advice will tell you what to do

01:03:36,230 --> 01:03:43,370
yeah it's much better to scale back your

01:03:39,170 --> 01:03:48,190
event and have it do less so that you

01:03:43,370 --> 01:03:50,540
can enjoy it it's mmm it's almost always

01:03:48,190 --> 01:03:52,610
people who are doing this on their own

01:03:50,540 --> 01:03:54,440
time so they're not doing it as part of

01:03:52,610 --> 01:03:55,130
their job so if it isn't fun people are

01:03:54,440 --> 01:03:57,800
going to put

01:03:55,130 --> 01:04:00,680
go and as an organizer it should be

01:03:57,800 --> 01:04:04,100
enjoyable for you too yeah you wanted

01:04:00,680 --> 01:04:07,310
out here people should be respectful of

01:04:04,100 --> 01:04:11,300
your time and energy so if it's too much

01:04:07,310 --> 01:04:12,950
for you just scale it back so a lot of

01:04:11,300 --> 01:04:14,300
this like documenting that we were

01:04:12,950 --> 01:04:17,930
talking about comes in really handy

01:04:14,300 --> 01:04:20,900
after the event and it is super helpful

01:04:17,930 --> 01:04:27,050
to make a blog post about your sprint

01:04:20,900 --> 01:04:29,390
and make a comment on the announcement

01:04:27,050 --> 01:04:32,480
of your event so that people know what

01:04:29,390 --> 01:04:35,870
happened and thank anybody who

01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:37,880
volunteered and your sponsors that's one

01:04:35,870 --> 01:04:40,040
of the ways that they get paid if

01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:45,140
they're not getting paid is by

01:04:40,040 --> 01:04:48,370
recognition so dish it out liberally and

01:04:45,140 --> 01:04:50,900
then after your event think about um

01:04:48,370 --> 01:04:53,360
what you want to do differently next

01:04:50,900 --> 01:04:57,560
time and share that with the world it

01:04:53,360 --> 01:05:00,200
will help future planners plan things so

01:04:57,560 --> 01:05:02,900
we we talked a lot about like all these

01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:04,370
things right the logistics and the

01:05:02,900 --> 01:05:08,570
planning and what you to do with the

01:05:04,370 --> 01:05:10,940
event and it seems kind of overwhelming

01:05:08,570 --> 01:05:12,530
and it also varies depending upon what

01:05:10,940 --> 01:05:13,850
kind of event you're going to have

01:05:12,530 --> 01:05:18,170
whether or not you're going to have

01:05:13,850 --> 01:05:20,510
something small or something big yeah so

01:05:18,170 --> 01:05:23,210
for small sprinting you can host a

01:05:20,510 --> 01:05:24,980
sprint of any kind any shape any form

01:05:23,210 --> 01:05:28,690
you'll just tailor it to what your

01:05:24,980 --> 01:05:32,030
resources are but for a small sprint

01:05:28,690 --> 01:05:33,260
concentrate on your location your venues

01:05:32,030 --> 01:05:35,720
going to be the most important part if

01:05:33,260 --> 01:05:37,010
you have ten people showing up or fewer

01:05:35,720 --> 01:05:38,930
than that you don't have to worry about

01:05:37,010 --> 01:05:40,160
catering you don't worry about sponsor

01:05:38,930 --> 01:05:41,390
you don't need t-shirts you don't need

01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:43,040
stickers you don't need any of these

01:05:41,390 --> 01:05:45,980
things just worry about having the right

01:05:43,040 --> 01:05:48,260
venue with properly working Wi-Fi and

01:05:45,980 --> 01:05:50,060
then your basic logistics you know that

01:05:48,260 --> 01:05:54,860
you have power strips and things like

01:05:50,060 --> 01:05:57,560
that and that's about it for a larger

01:05:54,860 --> 01:05:59,990
event it's going to need a lot more

01:05:57,560 --> 01:06:02,600
planning in advance and you're going to

01:05:59,990 --> 01:06:05,300
need a lot of help you're going to need

01:06:02,600 --> 01:06:07,520
volunteers to help with the logistics

01:06:05,300 --> 01:06:08,690
ahead of time and these don't have to be

01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:11,119
people that are necessarily

01:06:08,690 --> 01:06:13,760
good working on issues this can be a

01:06:11,119 --> 01:06:16,069
whole new people a pool of people to

01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:19,490
draw on you're going to need to be a lot

01:06:16,069 --> 01:06:21,319
more organized in terms of communicating

01:06:19,490 --> 01:06:24,190
with your volunteers and the people who

01:06:21,319 --> 01:06:27,260
are involved with planning and it

01:06:24,190 --> 01:06:30,619
everything just needs to be done ahead

01:06:27,260 --> 01:06:33,829
of time way ahead of time the bigger ear

01:06:30,619 --> 01:06:36,829
sprint gets so you can totally handle a

01:06:33,829 --> 01:06:48,650
gigantic sprint but it means a lot more

01:06:36,829 --> 01:06:50,930
planning in advance we have a lot of

01:06:48,650 --> 01:06:53,150
things that we talked about and we have

01:06:50,930 --> 01:06:56,630
links for them which we're going to

01:06:53,150 --> 01:07:01,190
share with you later we're going to post

01:06:56,630 --> 01:07:04,310
those slides on but the main thing to do

01:07:01,190 --> 01:07:06,619
if you want more detail about planning a

01:07:04,310 --> 01:07:08,540
sprint is to check out the sprint

01:07:06,619 --> 01:07:10,700
resources page that we have that is a

01:07:08,540 --> 01:07:13,970
child of the core mentoring page on

01:07:10,700 --> 01:07:19,900
drupal org so it's drupal.org / core

01:07:13,970 --> 01:07:22,849
dash mentoring / sprint resources and

01:07:19,900 --> 01:07:24,680
this is like the canonical place to go

01:07:22,849 --> 01:07:25,849
to when you're like oh my god I'm

01:07:24,680 --> 01:07:28,970
planning a sprint what the heck should I

01:07:25,849 --> 01:07:30,650
do this is it come here and if if

01:07:28,970 --> 01:07:32,300
there's not something that answers your

01:07:30,650 --> 01:07:35,060
question about sprint planning on this

01:07:32,300 --> 01:07:37,339
page let one of us know and we'll

01:07:35,060 --> 01:07:40,160
improve the document if you think of

01:07:37,339 --> 01:07:43,160
something to improve this is something

01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:45,740
anybody can edit so you can improve this

01:07:43,160 --> 01:07:48,200
page yourself and then we have a ton

01:07:45,740 --> 01:07:56,359
more links which we will share with you

01:07:48,200 --> 01:08:00,819
later because that's it that is it we

01:07:56,359 --> 01:08:05,180
had a couple of questions one was about

01:08:00,819 --> 01:08:09,290
and this is a I'm sure a sticky

01:08:05,180 --> 01:08:11,930
situation for others and how do you

01:08:09,290 --> 01:08:17,890
address personal hygiene prior to the

01:08:11,930 --> 01:08:21,850
event and you know treat it proactively

01:08:17,890 --> 01:08:25,830
before getting into a group setting

01:08:21,850 --> 01:08:29,890
has this ever happened to either of you

01:08:25,830 --> 01:08:32,170
well I know that um one of the things

01:08:29,890 --> 01:08:35,320
that we might send out in an

01:08:32,170 --> 01:08:38,770
announcement before the event is will

01:08:35,320 --> 01:08:42,670
remind people of what kind of weather

01:08:38,770 --> 01:08:44,680
they're expecting and like hey it might

01:08:42,670 --> 01:08:46,780
be cold or it might be super hot so

01:08:44,680 --> 01:08:51,730
people know how to address ahead of time

01:08:46,780 --> 01:08:56,290
but i don't think that particular thing

01:08:51,730 --> 01:08:59,859
has come up at any event that I've been

01:08:56,290 --> 01:09:02,920
at so I i would plan on not addressing

01:08:59,859 --> 01:09:07,060
it in advance and just dealing with it

01:09:02,920 --> 01:09:09,490
on with the particular individuals

01:09:07,060 --> 01:09:11,320
involved and making recommendations for

01:09:09,490 --> 01:09:14,680
the future I'm across that in the past

01:09:11,320 --> 01:09:18,340
not at any Drupal events thankfully but

01:09:14,680 --> 01:09:19,690
other things unrelated and I recap it I

01:09:18,340 --> 01:09:21,190
don't think it's something that probably

01:09:19,690 --> 01:09:22,690
occurs often enough that you would

01:09:21,190 --> 01:09:24,910
address it in advance like sending out

01:09:22,690 --> 01:09:27,400
email saying hey make sure you take a

01:09:24,910 --> 01:09:31,990
shower before you go up right like it

01:09:27,400 --> 01:09:33,670
happened at an event um you probably

01:09:31,990 --> 01:09:36,310
need to at least keep an eye on it

01:09:33,670 --> 01:09:37,990
you're probably not going to do anything

01:09:36,310 --> 01:09:40,420
about the first time but if it's a

01:09:37,990 --> 01:09:42,730
particular individual who comes to

01:09:40,420 --> 01:09:45,190
multiple events and it's a problem then

01:09:42,730 --> 01:09:47,710
you do need to address it I would

01:09:45,190 --> 01:09:49,660
probably encourage you to talk to the DA

01:09:47,710 --> 01:09:51,070
about some conflict resolutions if you

01:09:49,660 --> 01:09:52,930
don't know how to handle that out of

01:09:51,070 --> 01:09:54,220
personal level but at some point you

01:09:52,930 --> 01:09:55,900
you're going to have to do that you're

01:09:54,220 --> 01:09:58,630
going to have to talk to that individual

01:09:55,900 --> 01:10:00,190
and let them know that this is a concern

01:09:58,630 --> 01:10:04,990
maybe they don't know about it maybe

01:10:00,190 --> 01:10:07,600
they do but that kind of problem the the

01:10:04,990 --> 01:10:09,640
issue is we don't want to offend anyone

01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:12,880
and we don't want to tell people turn

01:10:09,640 --> 01:10:14,260
people away but they also create a

01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:17,200
problem for everyone else who's

01:10:14,260 --> 01:10:19,090
attending so if it's really a major

01:10:17,200 --> 01:10:22,300
issue and that person does not want to

01:10:19,090 --> 01:10:25,440
address it and it means excluding that

01:10:22,300 --> 01:10:28,540
person you might have to do that yeah

01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:30,570
yeah I would just say overall um you

01:10:28,540 --> 01:10:33,160
know make sure that sensitivity and

01:10:30,570 --> 01:10:34,890
discretion is used when you're

01:10:33,160 --> 01:10:37,590
addressing the issue

01:10:34,890 --> 01:10:42,300
um which you know would be common sense

01:10:37,590 --> 01:10:44,790
for any particular sensitive topic we do

01:10:42,300 --> 01:10:47,480
have another question what kind of

01:10:44,790 --> 01:10:51,810
return should or can we provide a sprint

01:10:47,480 --> 01:10:55,230
sponsor so one of the things that is

01:10:51,810 --> 01:10:59,280
really nice is if a spring sponsor can

01:10:55,230 --> 01:11:01,050
actually attend the event at or send one

01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:03,240
of their people that's part of their

01:11:01,050 --> 01:11:08,280
organization to the event and then have

01:11:03,240 --> 01:11:10,470
that person and say like something at

01:11:08,280 --> 01:11:12,450
the event either in the beginning or at

01:11:10,470 --> 01:11:14,550
lunch or something like that and just

01:11:12,450 --> 01:11:18,720
say you know like give them five minutes

01:11:14,550 --> 01:11:21,060
and say hey everybody you know this was

01:11:18,720 --> 01:11:24,450
made possible by this person and this

01:11:21,060 --> 01:11:28,050
organization you know let's let's thank

01:11:24,450 --> 01:11:29,520
them and and it goes back to your

01:11:28,050 --> 01:11:31,830
visibility again making sure that you

01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:35,120
have avenues to thank them thank them at

01:11:31,830 --> 01:11:37,320
the event or after if you have a website

01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:39,450
you know making sure they're visible but

01:11:37,320 --> 01:11:42,090
as far as like actual business returns

01:11:39,450 --> 01:11:43,830
themselves I don't think you can give

01:11:42,090 --> 01:11:45,960
them any particular expectations that's

01:11:43,830 --> 01:11:47,760
really for them to determine most of the

01:11:45,960 --> 01:11:50,400
sponsors that are giving you money are

01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:52,710
going to base it on sort of goodwill and

01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:54,990
to get visibility for themselves and

01:11:52,710 --> 01:11:56,310
they're going to do some calculations to

01:11:54,990 --> 01:11:58,560
determine what kind of return they're

01:11:56,310 --> 01:12:00,840
getting on that visibility but I don't

01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:02,900
think that you in particular can set

01:12:00,840 --> 01:12:10,290
that expectation for them out of beds

01:12:02,900 --> 01:12:12,570
right it it it's possible um to it

01:12:10,290 --> 01:12:14,190
depends on the focus of your event in

01:12:12,570 --> 01:12:18,150
the audience and the people who are

01:12:14,190 --> 01:12:21,270
attending but if you're trying to like

01:12:18,150 --> 01:12:23,340
for example on dev days is coming up in

01:12:21,270 --> 01:12:25,860
France and one of the things that we're

01:12:23,340 --> 01:12:29,970
going to focus on there is performance

01:12:25,860 --> 01:12:33,240
so if you have a sponsor who is running

01:12:29,970 --> 01:12:35,070
a gigantic project and performance is

01:12:33,240 --> 01:12:37,380
really important to them right the

01:12:35,070 --> 01:12:41,100
return that they could get on helping to

01:12:37,380 --> 01:12:46,780
sponsor this event is you know better

01:12:41,100 --> 01:12:49,119
performance but uh most

01:12:46,780 --> 01:12:51,250
I think practical returns that you can

01:12:49,119 --> 01:12:52,659
tell like you can communicate with your

01:12:51,250 --> 01:12:53,590
sponsors like if you're going to talk to

01:12:52,659 --> 01:12:55,719
them and they're going to say well what

01:12:53,590 --> 01:12:58,630
am I going to get out of this it's going

01:12:55,719 --> 01:13:01,780
to be visibility in the community and

01:12:58,630 --> 01:13:04,599
the way that that ends up benefiting a

01:13:01,780 --> 01:13:06,639
lot of organizations is that they are

01:13:04,599 --> 01:13:10,090
going to be able to hire better people

01:13:06,639 --> 01:13:13,599
and better people are going to want to

01:13:10,090 --> 01:13:18,840
work for them so i think the return for

01:13:13,599 --> 01:13:21,849
investors is a very long-term return and

01:13:18,840 --> 01:13:23,949
revolves more about around visibility

01:13:21,849 --> 01:13:28,440
and what you get from that visibility is

01:13:23,949 --> 01:13:28,440
you get better people working for you

01:13:28,739 --> 01:13:34,570
great um we've got a couple comments

01:13:32,050 --> 01:13:37,539

01:13:34,570 --> 01:13:40,840
join them thank you cathy and david for

01:13:37,539 --> 01:13:44,289
taking the time to work on this and of

course being a mentor in your own local

01:13:44,289 --> 01:13:50,860
area and globally I think it is is

01:13:47,650 --> 01:13:53,559
really fantastic to be able to work with

01:13:50,860 --> 01:13:55,360

01:13:59,050 --> 01:14:06,340
questions it will help us go forward and

01:14:03,849 --> 01:14:09,039
know a little bit about who is planning

01:14:06,340 --> 01:14:12,909
sprints and how can we address that

01:14:09,039 --> 01:14:15,489
properly so we thank you for your time

01:14:12,909 --> 01:14:17,320
we will be recording this session and

01:14:15,489 --> 01:14:19,389
posting it on our youtube channel and

01:14:17,320 --> 01:14:21,610
then of course we will have the slides

your local community as well thank you

01:14:24,820 --> 01:14:32,230
for your time the one thing we forgot to

01:14:27,130 --> 01:14:35,710
mention or that the DA has a newsletter

01:14:32,230 --> 01:14:38,199
for organizers so in addition to the

01:14:35,710 --> 01:14:41,289
sprint resources page that we have

01:14:38,199 --> 01:14:43,389
people should watch out for an email

01:14:41,289 --> 01:14:45,429
that they get or announcements about

01:14:43,389 --> 01:14:48,219
that and I highly encourage people to

01:14:45,429 --> 01:14:51,159
sign up for that newsletter and that

01:14:48,219 --> 01:14:52,960
will help disseminate some of the more

01:14:51,159 --> 01:14:55,539
details about information about having

01:14:52,960 --> 01:14:58,719
events and organizing things great
