good morning our good evening or good

00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:05,549
afternoon everyone depending on where

00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:10,590
you are in the world thank you so much

00:00:05,549 --> 00:00:12,540
for joining us I am here with Tim Lennon

00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:14,849
and he and I will give you an update

00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:18,000
about what is new at the Drupal

00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:20,609
Association and specifically what's

00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,289
happening on drupal.org because you're

00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:24,869
supporting partners and all of your

00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:26,699
money goes to fund the work that he and

00:00:24,869 --> 00:00:30,210
his team do we just want to really make

00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:31,949
sure you feel connected to to the area

00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:37,079
that you're investing which is so

00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:40,200
critical so just to get started little

00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:43,410
housekeeping if you could just remain

00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:44,700
muted during the call that way we don't

00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:46,920
get background noise because we are

00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,660
recording this and we'll send out the

00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:51,210
recording and the slides to all

00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:52,410
supporters after the call but we do you

00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:55,170
want to make sure that we filled your

00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:57,539
questions so there is a chat window for

00:00:55,170 --> 00:01:01,079
questions Tim will be watching the chat

00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:03,180
window I can't actually see it and so he

00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:07,740
will stop us as we need to answer

00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:09,270
questions and as you hear things if you

00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:11,040
like what you're hearing feel free to

00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:15,689
tweet it out and make sure you tag a

00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:17,820
triple Association we've got some news

00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:19,530
and as I mentioned we've got a

00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:23,430
drupal.org update we'd like to share

00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:27,990
with you first I just want to thank all

00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:31,259
of you for recognizing that drupal.org

00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:34,710
is a big asset for our whole community

00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:38,400
that we all benefit from and it's so

00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:41,280
important that we give it the funding it

00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:44,220
needs to not just exist but to evolve

00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,290
with all of our needs and it's the

00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:49,560
supporting partners that are providing a

00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:51,990
very large percentage of that funding

00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:54,030
through this crowd sourcing model that

00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:56,969
would come up with called supporting

00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:59,280
partner program and I'm actually going

00:01:56,969 --> 00:02:01,829
to be working on a report so you could

00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:04,500
see where funding comes from for

00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:06,509
drupal.org and how much is coming from

00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:09,989
the supporters it's really quite

00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:13,650
impressive and so we just want to say

00:02:09,989 --> 00:02:15,390
thank you for recognizing that

00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:18,750
just you know yes you can download

00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:21,209
Drupal and run a company with free

00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:24,659
software but you are the ones that

00:02:21,209 --> 00:02:27,269
recognize that giving back allows us to

00:02:24,659 --> 00:02:29,040
do more with this community site and and

00:02:27,269 --> 00:02:32,280
you're the ones that see that it does

00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:36,439
cost money to move this forward so so

00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:39,090
thank you alright let's go to some news

00:02:36,439 --> 00:02:41,159
so on the community front there's a

00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:43,560
couple things happening that I just

00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:49,859
wanted to call out the Drupal

00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:51,959
Association worked with the community to

00:02:49,859 --> 00:02:55,950
help them move forward with community

00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:59,639
governance improvements and discussions

00:02:55,950 --> 00:03:03,060
over the summer and we did hire Whitney

00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:06,989
has who ran several community discussion

00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:09,090
sessions and found findings of areas

00:03:06,989 --> 00:03:11,250
where there's consistent people had

00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:12,930
consistency of needs of where community

00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:15,329
governance need to improve as well as

00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:17,669
she identified with the community

00:03:15,329 --> 00:03:20,609
strategies they may want to use to

00:03:17,669 --> 00:03:25,079
address those needs and then she also

00:03:20,609 --> 00:03:26,489
did a survey with the community to find

00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:27,540
out more about what the community's

00:03:26,489 --> 00:03:30,959
needs are and how they want to move

00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:33,659
forward that work with Whitney concluded

00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:39,019
and the community working group heard

00:03:33,659 --> 00:03:42,000
the need that that we want to keep

00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:43,739
understanding how community governance

00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,620
can evolve and we want to make sure it's

00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:48,510
really owned by the community the Drupal

00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:53,340
Association is merely helping the

00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:54,870
community can organize and so that they

00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:58,109
can kind of take the ball and run with

00:03:54,870 --> 00:04:00,720
it and the CWG is a community group so

00:03:58,109 --> 00:04:03,090
they heard this call this need and they

00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,979
are working with the community now and

00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:09,090
the next steps to really clarify the

00:04:04,979 --> 00:04:11,639
areas that the community wants to fix in

00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:15,299
terms of governance and we're gonna hear

00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:17,609
soon about their recommendations and so

00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:19,769
that that process is kind of ongoing

00:04:17,609 --> 00:04:21,239
right now but I'm really glad to see

00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:22,500
that it's progressing we're really

00:04:21,239 --> 00:04:24,120
thankful for the work that community

00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:26,070
working group is doing on that front as

00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,830
well as some others that have joined

00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:29,830
them

00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:32,289
to move community governance forward and

00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:37,569
one of the things that we heard in terms

00:04:32,289 --> 00:04:41,050
of need in the community is more clarity

00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:43,569
around Rhys Butte arts roles he has many

00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:46,419
roles he's you know the benevolent

00:04:43,569 --> 00:04:48,520
dictator for life which means he's

00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:51,669
really a project lead for the whole

00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:53,919
project and of course he has his role at

00:04:51,669 --> 00:04:57,129
Acquia and he has a role on the Drupal

00:04:53,919 --> 00:05:00,360
Association board and while community

00:04:57,129 --> 00:05:02,919
governance is evolving and it'll impact

00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:05,069
aspects of the community there are

00:05:02,919 --> 00:05:07,990
things within the Drupal Association

00:05:05,069 --> 00:05:11,139
which only the Drupal Association has

00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:13,650
governance over and can fix so what you

00:05:11,139 --> 00:05:15,849
know we don't want to wait for

00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:18,279
everything to come together all at once

00:05:15,849 --> 00:05:20,190
there are some things we can do now to

00:05:18,279 --> 00:05:24,580
address the needs of the community and

00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:26,379
Drees heard the call that you know one

00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:29,319
solution could be that he steps down as

00:05:26,379 --> 00:05:30,879
chairman but remains on the board in the

00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:34,629
seat that was designed for him called

00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:37,599
the founding director seat and so he has

00:05:34,629 --> 00:05:40,840
decided to go ahead and take that step

00:05:37,599 --> 00:05:43,589
and again he will remain on the board

00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:47,050
but in this founding director position

00:05:43,589 --> 00:05:51,520
and it is renewed every year has to be

00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:52,990
voted in every year and so you know what

00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:55,539
that does is that he's just not driving

00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:59,139
all the agendas and managing the

00:05:55,539 --> 00:06:01,419
committees for the Association and so we

00:05:59,139 --> 00:06:03,849
need someone else who can do that the

00:06:01,419 --> 00:06:06,610
community had also said that they would

00:06:03,849 --> 00:06:12,610
like to see some outside expertise come

00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:15,430
in and to have someone that's neutral to

00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:19,150
be the Chairman and so we heard that and

00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:21,129
we have asked Adam Goodman to be the

00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:24,129
chairman of the board

00:06:21,129 --> 00:06:27,550
Adam Goodman has been advising the board

00:06:24,129 --> 00:06:29,500
for the last eight years on and off we

00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:33,789
used to be a volunteer board and now

00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:35,800
we're a strategic board and he has been

00:06:33,789 --> 00:06:38,169
the one that's come in and helped to

00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:39,279
evolve this board and while he's

00:06:38,169 --> 00:06:42,129
chairman he

00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:43,809
will we remain in that type of role he's

00:06:42,129 --> 00:06:46,989
going to keep evolving the board and

00:06:43,809 --> 00:06:51,429
helping us orient around having a new

00:06:46,989 --> 00:06:54,119
chairman and so of course we will want

00:06:51,429 --> 00:06:56,229
to continue a search for a permanent

00:06:54,119 --> 00:07:00,309
chairman because Adams playing an

00:06:56,229 --> 00:07:03,309
interim role and I think it's also just

00:07:00,309 --> 00:07:05,859
important to point out that he is a paid

00:07:03,309 --> 00:07:08,229
consultant and we will be paying him for

00:07:05,859 --> 00:07:11,499
this service and we are updating the

00:07:08,229 --> 00:07:12,879
bylaws in order to accommodate that we

00:07:11,499 --> 00:07:15,189
announced that at the last board meeting

00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:16,659
and we just want to be really

00:07:15,189 --> 00:07:19,419
transparent about that and we'll be

00:07:16,659 --> 00:07:23,289
voting on those changes I believe the

00:07:19,419 --> 00:07:25,869
next board meeting so I think these are

00:07:23,289 --> 00:07:28,689
really positive steps we're excited

00:07:25,869 --> 00:07:31,929
about them but more importantly it just

00:07:28,689 --> 00:07:38,079
feels good to hear the community and to

00:07:31,929 --> 00:07:41,039
make some some improvements of our own

00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:43,149
and you know we're all in this together

00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:46,089
another thing I want to point out that

00:07:43,149 --> 00:07:50,619
we're doing is hiring a community

00:07:46,089 --> 00:07:52,659
liaison this is a specific role to help

00:07:50,619 --> 00:07:55,749
build a better relationship between the

00:07:52,659 --> 00:07:56,769
Association and the community we

00:07:55,749 --> 00:07:58,179
definitely heard the new that there

00:07:56,769 --> 00:08:02,379
needs to be more clarity and

00:07:58,179 --> 00:08:04,360
transparency more engagement the

00:08:02,379 --> 00:08:07,569
community needs help understanding more

00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:09,549
about our programs about our financials

00:08:07,569 --> 00:08:11,739
there's just a lot of things when we

00:08:09,549 --> 00:08:14,289
became a smaller organization we really

00:08:11,739 --> 00:08:17,919
lost a lot of our community

00:08:14,289 --> 00:08:19,419
communication staff and we're feeling it

00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:22,179
I think we're all feeling it and so this

00:08:19,419 --> 00:08:24,219
role is to fill that gap and is to

00:08:22,179 --> 00:08:27,009
foster bi-directional communication

00:08:24,219 --> 00:08:31,389
between the community and the Drupal

00:08:27,009 --> 00:08:35,289
Association and so you'll see this role

00:08:31,389 --> 00:08:37,180
we'll do things like be in the social

00:08:35,289 --> 00:08:38,769
channels and helping to make sure that

00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:42,009
when there's big questions out there are

00:08:38,769 --> 00:08:46,329
someone's there answering them and can

00:08:42,009 --> 00:08:48,790
also get a canonical space drupal.org to

00:08:46,329 --> 00:08:51,370
put up information about the association

00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:53,010
so it's really easy to find how are we

00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:56,740
performing financially

00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:57,940
so so many things community elections

00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:59,829
this person can run the community

00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:02,139
elections for us and really make sure

00:08:59,829 --> 00:09:05,050
there's a transparent and clear process

00:09:02,139 --> 00:09:06,550
and lots of engagement so I think it's

00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:08,440
gonna really help build that

00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:12,459
relationship that we all want to have

00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:14,529
and help people understand that the

00:09:12,459 --> 00:09:16,690
Drupal Association is here to serve the

00:09:14,529 --> 00:09:18,760
community and how we're doing and then

00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:20,290
also to be more agile to hear the needs

00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:25,420
so that we can find new ways to serve

00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:30,639
the community I'll be sorry we had one

00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:32,410
question okay and I think it you did you

00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:35,050
did address it to something certain a

00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:36,519
certain extent so Gabriel s well juries

00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:37,899
need to be voted into the founding role

00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:39,760
each year and will he

00:09:37,899 --> 00:09:42,790
when is he announcing that decision to

00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:44,649
step into the new role you as you

00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:46,899
already said that role is voted on every

00:09:44,649 --> 00:09:49,360
year by the board to affirm the position

00:09:46,899 --> 00:09:51,010
if it's not filled it would stand to

00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:53,290
empty because it is a seat just for the

00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:54,760
founder and then in terms of the

00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:56,709
decision it was announced at the last

00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:58,000
public board meeting so it's it's there

00:09:56,709 --> 00:09:59,440
it's in the recording and everything

00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,190
else I don't know if he'll do additional

00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:05,380
blog posts or something like that but

00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:07,690
right we'll make sure that yeah so all

00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:09,490
of that is correct the founding position

00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:11,440
is like where he actually sits and then

00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:14,019
you get kind of got pointed to chairman

00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:15,519
and to be very clear it's actually

00:10:14,019 --> 00:10:18,010
called president when you look in the

00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:19,060
bylaws it's just that most people keep

00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:21,880
referring to him as chairman so I'm

00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:24,040
trying not to muddy language here and he

00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:25,870
has always you know even like just last

00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:30,490
November we did the annual voting in

00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:32,860
just a we do we've been maintaining that

00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:34,480
and we'll continue to do it it's just we

00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:37,300
won't be playing him to the Chairman

00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:40,060
rule and yes it has already been

00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:42,910
announced and we will continue to

00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:46,329
communicate out when it's all official

00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:49,060
and we also want you to know who Adam is

00:10:46,329 --> 00:10:50,980
so you will also see probably a blog

00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:53,440
post with some kind of interview and

00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:56,170
there as well just a little background

00:10:53,440 --> 00:11:00,819
Adam Goodman is a professor at

00:10:56,170 --> 00:11:02,350
Northwestern University um he is he

00:11:00,819 --> 00:11:04,690
heads up the leadership program there so

00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:07,030
is an expert on leadership and advice

00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:09,720
boards and helping boards become better

00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:12,940
and organizations to become better so

00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:15,040
you know he has no stake and Drupal he

00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:19,620
just likes to see organizations grow and

00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:19,620
be healthy any other questions

00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:25,930
okay well then I just wanted to give an

00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:28,300
update on Drupal con viana it was a very

00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:34,620
successful event with 1600 plus

00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:34,620
attendees as you may have read or heard

00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:42,040
through by I think it was like a five

00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:45,640
blog post series about Drupal con Europe

00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:48,310
that it has it has unique value it is

00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:51,310
important however right now our

00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:54,580
operational model and the way that it's

00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:58,990
being organized right now is resulted in

00:11:54,580 --> 00:12:01,540
a loss and when we went to you know work

00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:04,480
on the content the programming changes

00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:07,960
it wasn't conceived as highly valuable

00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:10,180
before and it's even with the trying to

00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:12,940
redesign it with community input still

00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:17,260
wasn't hitting the mark which is all

00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:19,660
concerning we've seen that reflected in

00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:20,920
ticket sales declining but I just want

00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:24,580
to be very clear I think this is a

00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:28,030
product issue not a Drupal issue because

00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:30,280
camps have been on the rise year over

00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:33,220
year in Europe as people are finding

00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:35,800
different ways to meet their needs so

00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:38,200
you know we're looking at this and we

00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:40,240
came to a conclusion that we do not want

00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:43,150
to just keep doing over instant repeat

00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:45,310
every year and and just hoping it gets

00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:50,280
better we need to have a serious rethink

00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:52,720
and a different operational model that

00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:57,690
focuses on sustainability as well as

00:12:52,720 --> 00:13:01,050
value and so here is what's happening

00:12:57,690 --> 00:13:06,400
we're taking a pause of Drupal con and

00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:08,140
2018 we are working on a new operational

00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:10,810
model we think it should be a licensed

00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:13,960
model we're exploring that and we want

00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:18,110
to find an entity that's grounded in the

00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:19,880
community to take on Drupal

00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:22,850
on Europe in 2019 and we would license

00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:27,710
it to them and I have a committee of

00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:30,080
European that organizers helping me to

00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:31,850
think this through and get feedback and

00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:33,530
we do have some entities that are

00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:36,440
considering this so we're working with

00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:38,870
them to test this concept at the end of

00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:44,660
the day DrupalCon Europe is important it

00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:46,520
brings all kinds of people together from

00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:48,470
different countries different personas

00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:50,450
the business side the developers side

00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:54,610
and it breaks down barriers and allows

00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:57,380
very unique and very needed

00:13:54,610 --> 00:14:00,410
cross-pollination of ideas and also it's

00:13:57,380 --> 00:14:02,450
a huge engine for contribution so I want

00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:06,440
you to know we are taking extreme care

00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:09,110
about triple con Europe's future because

00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:10,490
we know how important it is and I'm

00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:14,420
excited for the progress we're making

00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:19,310
there and we'll keep everyone up to date

00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:21,380
what's happening there meanwhile the

00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:25,480
community in Europe feel strongly that

00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:27,830
something does need to happen in 2018

00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:29,510
they understand that the Drupal

00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:32,270
Association from a capacity standpoint

00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:34,610
can't have this big resync and produce a

00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:36,020
Drupal con at the same time that's

00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:37,760
actually been the problems we haven't

00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:40,790
had time to slow down to really think

00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:43,070
this through in a bigger holistic way so

00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:44,840
you know we can't hold Drupal con in

00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:47,830
2018 but the community feels strongly

00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:50,540
that it is held something is held that

00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:52,400
does a couple things one allows for that

00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:54,470
cross-pollination of different personas

00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:57,260
and people from different countries but

00:14:54,470 --> 00:15:00,400
it also needs to be an MVP and really

00:14:57,260 --> 00:15:02,830
experiment and try different things

00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:05,860
there's a group that's stepped up

00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:10,220
they've been putting out medium posts

00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:11,480
there's you know me about 12 people in

00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:14,150
that group and there's so many more

00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:15,590
volunteers and I really am incredibly

00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:17,630
impressed with the progress they're

00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:21,050
making trying to figure out how to bring

00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:22,700
this event together and I definitely

00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:26,770
support them moving in that direction

00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:31,350
they have a lot to figure out and

00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:34,430
they're going to need support and so

00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:38,550
what I'd like to just say about this is

00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:40,530
Drupal con or Drupal Europe 2018 is

00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:43,700
important and since there isn't a Drupal

00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:47,670
Cohen that year if you were sponsoring

00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:49,440
Drupal con Europe I I ask if you will

00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:52,710
support this group in what they were

00:15:49,440 --> 00:16:00,270
doing with sponsorship dollars I think

00:15:52,710 --> 00:16:01,980
it is not just admirable but very

00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:04,620
impressive that they want to come

00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:07,800
together and try new things and try this

00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:09,630
MVP approach so I do have an appeal

00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:12,450
asking you to support them with your

00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:16,020
sponsorship dollars and that brings me

00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:20,310
just to a big question that's come up

00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:21,600
especially for supporters in Europe one

00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:25,770
of the things that people have asked me

00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:27,660
is wait I'm confused if I'm if you're

00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:29,160
not having a Drupal con and gear up and

00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:32,370
I'm giving money to the Drupal

00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:34,680
Association what am i funding because I

00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:38,670
don't want to just fund Drupal con North

00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:40,260
America and we don't want that either we

00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:41,910
want to make sure people are very clear

00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:44,460
where their money's going and that they

00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:47,130
feel good about the investments that

00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:49,590
they're making so I wanted to break it

00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:52,830
down for everyone those that are

00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:54,380
sponsoring an individual and or those

00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:57,120
that have an individual organization

00:16:54,380 --> 00:17:01,050
membership they're paying about 30 to

00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:06,120
100 US dollars that money is funding

00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:08,070
community grants that means we give

00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:09,990
money to the community cultivation group

00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:12,750
it's a committee of community members

00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:15,600
they receive requests from camps from

00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:18,840
Nigeria and the Philippines and China

00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:22,920
and gosh different places in South

00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:26,100
America and they provide 500 to about

00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:28,980
1,500 US dollars to these camps so that

00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:30,390
they can start growing because you know

00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:32,850
it takes a while to get sponsorships

00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:36,150
especially when you're in new markets

00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:37,920
new emerging places so the other thing

00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:39,810
that they fund are scholarships to bring

00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:42,020
people from around the world to Drupal

00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:43,740
con so this year as an example

00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:44,380
scholarships will be used to bring

00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:48,190
Europe

00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:49,570
and Africans South Americans right

00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:55,330
people from all over the world to

00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:59,500
DrupalCon North America and so it's not

00:17:55,330 --> 00:18:00,940
funding DrupalCon North America its

00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:03,460
funding these kinds of programs I just

00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:05,860
wanted to be clear about that also you

00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:07,870
as supporting partners just so you know

00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:11,460
where your money's going when you renew

00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:14,020
every year that is only two drupal.org

00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:16,270
which as you know supports the whole

00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:18,490
world including all of Europe and

00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:22,120
forty-four percent of contributions

00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:23,770
coming from Europe so you know you can

00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:26,020
feel good knowing that your money is

00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:29,650
definitely supporting your your region

00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:32,020
as well as the world and again it is

00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:34,390
only going to drupal.org and then of

00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:37,620
course event sponsorship goes to the

00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:39,610
event you're sponsoring right it helps

00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:41,980
fund that conference

00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:43,900
so if you are sponsoring DrupalCon North

00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:47,080
America it's going to DrupalCon North

00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:50,560
America if you are funding Drupal Europe

00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:52,690
2018 its funding that event so I hope

00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:55,030
that chart helps and if you have

00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:58,180
questions please let me know and again

00:18:55,030 --> 00:19:00,550
we are working with our financial

00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:02,500
company to come up with better weather

00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:04,180
reports that really break it down and

00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:06,280
make it easy and digestible so you don't

00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:09,540
have to just look at pls that don't

00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:09,540
really answer the questions you may have

00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:16,690
all right if there's no questions then

00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:20,980
um why don't I hand it over to you Tim

00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:23,500
and I can just drive the slides great

00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:25,540
thanks Megan first of all I just would

00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:28,270
like to repeat the thanks to all of you

00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:30,190
as supporting partners who fund that the

00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:31,900
work we do on drupal.org and my team

00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:34,330
specifically if you go to the next slide

00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:36,610
Megan this is the engineering team that

00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:38,380
works on True Blood org every day and

00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:40,030
that's not everyone who adds value there

00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:42,490
of course because we have the people who

00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:43,870
manage membership and communications and

00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:45,640
all sorts of other things that happen on

00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:47,410
True Blood org and other channels but in

00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:49,150
terms of the the features that support

00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:51,130
the business community in the developer

00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:52,660
community I just thought it would be

00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:56,400
good to put some faces with names of

00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:58,240
people you see in the issue queue who

00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,380
rely on your support

00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:05,860
be able to do what we do for the

00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:07,960
community keep going Megan one of the

00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:10,420
changes that we made in the last quarter

00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:13,140
relating to the adoption journey and

00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:15,730
promoting Drupal to evaluators and to

00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:17,620
also the saying thank you to to you all

00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:20,830
as supporters is that we've added a

00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:22,270
second row of case studies here to the

00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:23,710
front page of Drupal adorn which our

00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:26,530
partner and contributor case studies

00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:28,570
that we feed from current supporting

00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:30,100
partners or from people who are sort of

00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:32,620
top of the contribution rankings in the

00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:33,700
marketplace so we encourage you if

00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:34,960
you're a supportive partner and you

00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:37,120
don't yet have any case studies

00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:38,440
entrepreneur --g and you'd like to

00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:40,330
eventually a participate in this program

00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:41,710
a good first step is of course just

00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:43,720
getting those case studies up and then

00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:45,910
you know we'll reach out to you as we're

00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:47,140
working on rotating through these slots

00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:49,450
but we're really happy about this

00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:52,000
because it helps Center some of the

00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:54,250
critical stories about a success of

00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:57,340
Drupal right up front on the home page

00:20:54,250 --> 00:21:02,740
and really really promote that to the

00:20:57,340 --> 00:21:04,120
community at large next another thing

00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:07,080
that we've done is we've made some

00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:12,460
updates to the drupal.org industry page

00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:14,650
landing page so this is the the page

00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:16,330
where we describe the value of Drupal

00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:18,309
solutions in different vertical markets

00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:19,720
so our before that we have right now our

00:21:18,309 --> 00:21:21,370
healthcare higher ed media and

00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:24,850
publishing government and we'll be

00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:27,340
working on others going forward we just

00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:29,700
updated this a little bit again to

00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:32,650
promote those pages but also to promote

00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:35,410
kind of the whole cross-section of

00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:38,830
different hosting partners and hosting

00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:40,720
solutions that can be part of a complete

00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:42,150
solution so that's just a small update

00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:44,800
to that page that we think will help

00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:51,429
evaluators find the right right

00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:53,260
solutions for their needs next slide as

00:21:51,429 --> 00:21:55,270
I mentioned the healthcare page is one

00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:56,800
of the pages one of the solution

00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:58,870
industry solution pages that we're

00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:00,850
promoting right now it's the latest one

00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:05,050
to be released so it talks about some

00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:07,630
great stories about success in health

00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:08,890
care using Drupal as a solution and

00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:11,460
we're just proud to get this next one

00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:13,410
live and ready to go

00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:17,390
yeah we'll be following it up with a few

00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:17,390
more industry solution pages soon

00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:22,380
another small change that we made is

00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:24,720
that we on the download an extent page

00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:26,730
we're now featuring community faces and

00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:29,880
community stories with an appeal for

00:22:26,730 --> 00:22:33,330
membership so you can see here we have

00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:35,340
fatima talking about the the her

00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:37,770
participation in the community and the

00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:39,360
value of Drupal just not just as a as an

00:22:37,770 --> 00:22:40,650
open source project but as a community

00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,720
of people who come together to build

00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:44,190
something pretty incredible we're

00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,750
rotating through different phases and

00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:48,000
stories and we think this is a great way

00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:49,950
to reach out to people who aren't yet

00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:54,270
involved and to get them more involved

00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:55,710
in the project as far as the

00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:58,190
contribution journey goes over the last

00:22:55,710 --> 00:23:01,920
quarter we've made a few changes as well

00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:04,920
for for all of our project maintainer x'

00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:07,950
of control or core projects who work on

00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:09,480
drupal.org we've automated the process

00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:12,540
of making sure that they get issued

00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:15,390
credit if they whenever they commit an

00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:17,970
RT bc issue to their projects so that

00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:20,820
just streamlines that whole process and

00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:22,620
make sure that all of our anyone who

00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:24,000
maintains a module whether that's an

00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:26,520
organization or an individual

00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,620
contributor it's getting the credit that

00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:33,960
they deserve for that hard work that

00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:36,870
they do for us as a community we also

00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:38,250
have updated the testing system with a

00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:40,710
variety of new features that I think

00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:42,960
really help one of them sort of reduces

00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:45,030
a significant portion of the kind of the

00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:47,190
busy work that can go into doing code

00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:50,730
review on drupal.org which is we now

00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:53,970
generate an automatic code style fix

00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:55,740
patch in the test results so instead of

00:23:53,970 --> 00:24:00,810
having to sort of go in and manually

00:23:55,740 --> 00:24:02,520
correct your periods and semicolons and

00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:04,350
extra spaces and all that kind of stuff

00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:06,930
that a patch is just immediately

00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:09,660
generated and we're working as a next

00:24:06,930 --> 00:24:11,280
step to automatically apply that back to

00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:14,040
the code and back into the issue queue

00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:16,500
just to reduce that busy work and and

00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:21,150
increase the velocity of developer

00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:23,730
community in general one thing that we'd

00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:25,470
like to do as a future step although

00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:29,190
there isn't really low-hanging fruit

00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:32,279
we want to take advantage of providing

00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:34,230
contribution credit for contributions

00:24:32,279 --> 00:24:36,629
that occur outside of drupal.org so that

00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:39,299
means if you're a camp organizer if you

00:24:36,629 --> 00:24:41,789
organize Sprint's if you're a mentor we

00:24:39,299 --> 00:24:44,009
want to find ways to recognize those

00:24:41,789 --> 00:24:46,860
contributions on drupal.org as part of

00:24:44,009 --> 00:24:48,629
our contribution marketplace there's no

00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:50,669
lower hanging fruit here as I say we

00:24:48,629 --> 00:24:52,740
need to do some work to make this

00:24:50,669 --> 00:24:55,110
possible in terms of providing an

00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:58,110
authentication endpoint so that people

00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:59,759
can integrate that on their camp

00:24:58,110 --> 00:25:01,590
registration sites and then send back

00:24:59,759 --> 00:25:03,179
information about who's fulfilling what

00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:04,559
roles at the camps and things like that

00:25:03,179 --> 00:25:05,669
it's gonna take some work but it's

00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:07,289
something we're looking into you and we

00:25:05,669 --> 00:25:08,970
just want to let you all know that we're

00:25:07,289 --> 00:25:10,769
it's important to us to recognize these

00:25:08,970 --> 00:25:12,870
contributions coming from individuals

00:25:10,769 --> 00:25:17,960
and organizations that happen outside of

00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:20,549
just the official Drupal door channels I

00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:23,519
also wanted to provide a short update on

00:25:20,549 --> 00:25:26,190
project creation as as you probably know

00:25:23,519 --> 00:25:27,720
about six months ago we changed the way

00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:29,159
that project creation works on Drupal

00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:32,100
Authority used to be the case that you

00:25:29,159 --> 00:25:34,590
had to put in a project application and

00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:37,889
wait for group volunteers to do a sort

00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:39,960
of manual review before a project was

00:25:37,889 --> 00:25:42,330
approved to be become a full project on

00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:45,870
Trueblood org and about six months ago

00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:48,419
we changed that so that any any

00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:51,480
confirmed user can now just go ahead and

00:25:48,419 --> 00:25:54,389
create full projects and we added new

00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:56,970
project signals on drupal.org so that it

00:25:54,389 --> 00:25:58,440
the evaluators of those modules can see

00:25:56,970 --> 00:25:59,850
whether or not they're participating in

00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:01,799
security advisory coverage or other

00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:03,450
things and we're really pleased with how

00:26:01,799 --> 00:26:05,730
those changes have gone we're monitoring

00:26:03,450 --> 00:26:07,379
it very carefully because the quality

00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:08,730
and security of joopa modules is really

00:26:07,379 --> 00:26:10,559
important and that's something we wanted

00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:12,179
to keep an eye on but so far we're

00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:13,500
really just seeing positive signals so

00:26:12,179 --> 00:26:15,480
there was in the six month period

00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:17,460
following this change we saw a fifty

00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:19,080
fifty eight percent almost sixty percent

00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:21,330
increase in the rate of project creation

00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:23,549
on drupal.org anecdotally I've seen

00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:25,350
projects come back that had been you

00:26:23,549 --> 00:26:27,029
know so frustrated with the application

00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:28,259
process that they just didn't host their

00:26:27,029 --> 00:26:29,580
code on Drupal it already they left it

00:26:28,259 --> 00:26:30,389
up on github or they didn't contribute

00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:32,789
it back at all

00:26:30,389 --> 00:26:34,110
and now those those modules are there

00:26:32,789 --> 00:26:35,549
for the rest of the community to take

00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:40,820
advantage of so we're really pleased

00:26:35,549 --> 00:26:40,820
with that change next slide

00:26:41,479 --> 00:26:47,129
let's hear the other note on that front

00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:48,989
just to just to give everyone some

00:26:47,129 --> 00:26:51,149
insight into this right the major

00:26:48,989 --> 00:26:53,549
concern there would be oh if we have

00:26:51,149 --> 00:26:54,929
more projects do we have more projects

00:26:53,549 --> 00:26:57,179
that just don't receive security

00:26:54,929 --> 00:26:57,720
advisory coverage we are keeping an eye

00:26:57,179 --> 00:26:59,429
on that

00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:03,289
the rate of change for for those

00:26:59,429 --> 00:27:05,639
projects is only about half a percent

00:27:03,289 --> 00:27:08,519
increase over the people over about a

00:27:05,639 --> 00:27:09,989
six month period for four full projects

00:27:08,519 --> 00:27:12,090
that don't have coverage but do you have

00:27:09,989 --> 00:27:14,669
more than 50 sites using them so that's

00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:16,470
that that's kind of a risk vector and

00:27:14,669 --> 00:27:17,789
that's pretty small so we're pleased

00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:19,109
with that and we're continuing to work

00:27:17,789 --> 00:27:21,929
with the security working group one

00:27:19,109 --> 00:27:27,299
other steps that would help address this

00:27:21,929 --> 00:27:29,989
concern so as I mentioned one of the

00:27:27,299 --> 00:27:32,429
changes we were making as part of

00:27:29,989 --> 00:27:34,440
revamping how project creation works is

00:27:32,429 --> 00:27:35,489
to change the signals for evaluators to

00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:39,029
project so that they can better

00:27:35,489 --> 00:27:42,149
understand which projects to use so this

00:27:39,029 --> 00:27:44,639
is what a mature project page looks like

00:27:42,149 --> 00:27:47,190
for the project information that's

00:27:44,639 --> 00:27:49,109
provided so for example you have your

00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:51,690
usage information you have an indication

00:27:49,109 --> 00:27:53,999
about security coverage you have the

00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:56,700
recommended release and you have recent

00:27:53,999 --> 00:27:58,619
test results and a link to the

00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:59,849
development version for developers or

00:27:58,619 --> 00:28:01,859
contributors who want to be interested

00:27:59,849 --> 00:28:02,869
in the project if you look at the next

00:28:01,859 --> 00:28:04,919
slide

00:28:02,869 --> 00:28:05,940
that'll this shows you what it looks

00:28:04,919 --> 00:28:07,799
like when a project is still in

00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:09,419
development so again you see usage

00:28:07,799 --> 00:28:11,580
information you see a warning that the

00:28:09,419 --> 00:28:14,729
project is not yet participating in

00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:16,440
security advisory coverage and instead

00:28:14,729 --> 00:28:18,419
of a recommended release you simply see

00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:19,979
just development of versions so what we

00:28:18,419 --> 00:28:21,629
want to make it really clear which

00:28:19,979 --> 00:28:23,549
projects are mature and ready for use

00:28:21,629 --> 00:28:28,080
and which projects are still still

00:28:23,549 --> 00:28:30,210
rolling still getting up to speed if we

00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:33,179
keep going one more thing that we did

00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:35,340
composer is obviously in a huge part of

00:28:33,179 --> 00:28:39,929
modern workflows especially in Drupal 8

00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:41,369
and and so we want to and of course if

00:28:39,929 --> 00:28:42,749
you're using composer to build a Drupal

00:28:41,369 --> 00:28:44,549
site you aren't necessarily looking at

00:28:42,749 --> 00:28:45,840
drupal.org project pages and therefore

00:28:44,549 --> 00:28:48,210
you don't necessarily see information

00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:50,460
about whether a particular release is

00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:52,680
included in security advisory coverage

00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:54,600
or not so to make this easy

00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:56,070
and to support automated tools that

00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:58,020
parse this information we've added

00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:59,640
security coverage metadata in the

00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:02,370
composer facade for all true political

00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:06,300
projects so as you can see this slide

00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:07,920
the next one and the next one there's

00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:10,470
now security coverage status information

00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:14,520
that is exposed to composer for all the

00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:18,360
projects host change with the Lord if we

00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:21,240
continue another thing I'd love to talk

00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:23,190
about one of the biggest things that we

00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:24,870
do as the troubadour ganja nearing team

00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:27,510
is we support testing for the project

00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:29,460
and making sure that you know regression

00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:31,260
testing so that changes to core are

00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:34,020
known to work in all the environments

00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:35,940
that we support so that control a 'test

00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:38,190
development versions of core and really

00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:40,560
it's a again it's another way to

00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:43,380
increase velocity for the development of

00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:44,670
the project as a whole I just want to

00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:46,740
give some stats because it's kind of

00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:48,870
incredible how much we do I'm not aware

00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:51,720
of any other project that is as robust

00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:54,120
with the level of testing and test

00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:59,160
coverage that the Drupal community holds

00:29:54,120 --> 00:30:01,140
as a standard so so far in 2017 we're up

00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:03,000
almost 17 percent year-over-year in

00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:06,150
terms of the number of complete test

00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:09,570
runs that's over 200,000 test runs and

00:30:06,150 --> 00:30:12,750
each of those full runs within it may

00:30:09,570 --> 00:30:14,270
have up to 80,000 individual test

00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:17,100
assertions so it's just a tremendous

00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:19,680
unbelievable amount of testing and

00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:21,480
you're so a supporter dollars help us

00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:25,140
fund all of these tests that keep this

00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:27,150
code quality as high as it is we're also

00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:29,880
starting to see this reflected in

00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:33,270
changes in the landscape we're seeing

00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:36,870
Drupal 7 tests decline as Drupal 7

00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:38,640
modules kind of roll off into mostly

00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:41,190
just maintenance mode and and the

00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:43,740
attention really refocuses on Drupal 8

00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:45,540
can't rib and on those modules getting

00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:48,090
really up to speed a lot of them are

00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:51,270
moving from beta to stable the lease and

00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:52,770
and just really getting fully up and

00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:55,080
running and I think we've seen that

00:30:52,770 --> 00:30:58,170
reflected but not just anecdotally but

00:30:55,080 --> 00:31:01,110
also in our testing data that that d8 is

00:30:58,170 --> 00:31:04,220
really taking over contribute tension if

00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:04,220
you go to the next slide Megan

00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:14,090
so one thing that we did just because

00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:15,470
the testing is such a critical part we

00:31:14,090 --> 00:31:18,710
you'll notice at the bottom of this

00:31:15,470 --> 00:31:20,360
image underneath the files table in the

00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:22,790
test results table and issues we now

00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:27,490
promote Drupal Association membership

00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:30,050
and we may promote direct sponsorship of

00:31:27,490 --> 00:31:31,820
Drupal CI and testing for the project in

00:31:30,050 --> 00:31:34,030
the future so just wanted to give you a

00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:36,530
kind of preview of what that looks like

00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:38,930
next slide

00:31:36,530 --> 00:31:40,820
another feature related to testing again

00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:43,460
I talked about coding standards earlier

00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:46,760
we found we also parsed code standards

00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:49,640
information so again just to make sure

00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:51,170
that especially for controlling Tanner's

00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:53,420
or people who are making some of their

00:31:51,170 --> 00:31:57,950
first contributions we really want to

00:31:53,420 --> 00:32:00,170
surface those harder to learn barriers

00:31:57,950 --> 00:32:02,150
to contribution like remembering how to

00:32:00,170 --> 00:32:03,980
get the exact coding standards and

00:32:02,150 --> 00:32:06,110
things like that right up into the test

00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:08,750
results where they're immediately there

00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:10,640
and immediately available to be fixed so

00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:15,500
we added coding standards parsing to the

00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:16,910
test results next slide another thing

00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:18,800
that we've done that we're really really

00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:23,570
proud of because we think again it's

00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:25,250
gonna really help contribute or is now

00:32:23,570 --> 00:32:27,800
on a six-month release cycle so we have

00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:31,100
a new point release of Drupal every six

00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:35,230
months with perhaps new experimental

00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:38,270
modules new stable modules with

00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:39,740
different you know additional new API is

00:32:38,270 --> 00:32:41,780
available and things like that and if

00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:43,430
you're working in the contribs space you

00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:44,870
have to keep up with these changes every

00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:47,720
six months with your module and with

00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:50,330
your testing and previously if you

00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:52,400
maintain an integration on drupal.org

00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:55,220
you'd have to go in and reconfigure your

00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:57,440
testing to say oh a fork it just came

00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:59,270
out so now I need to swap things around

00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:01,520
so I'm testing for eight five coming up

00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:03,950
what we've done is we've added semantic

00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:05,540
labels so now you just say I want to

00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:07,670
test against the development version of

00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:10,100
Drupal so in this case you know 8 5 X

00:33:07,670 --> 00:33:12,080
dev and then if a six-months release

00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:13,850
happens that allow automatically update

00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:16,970
so you're testing configuration will

00:33:13,850 --> 00:33:18,840
chase the current state of core without

00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:21,240
you having to remember to go in and

00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:25,290
came and update your ear testing for the

00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:28,290
modules that you might maintain now next

00:33:25,290 --> 00:33:31,290
slide yeah and I think that's that's

00:33:28,290 --> 00:33:33,690
pretty much it we have some more updates

00:33:31,290 --> 00:33:35,280
in the drupal.org panel at Rubicon Deana

00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:37,050
I don't know if that recording is

00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:38,400
available yet but you can sort of

00:33:37,050 --> 00:33:40,470
certainly take a look for that or reach

00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:42,480
out to me and if you have any questions

00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:45,720
feel free to drop them in chat or in the

00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:47,100
Q&A panel be happy to answer them or you

00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:49,620
can reach out to me i'm hester net on

00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:57,540
drupal.org and you can use my contact

00:33:49,620 --> 00:34:01,970
form and get in touch nope looks like

00:33:57,540 --> 00:34:06,150
we're all good for the moment okay I

00:34:01,970 --> 00:34:07,640
thank everyone for listening in but more

00:34:06,150 --> 00:34:09,780
importantly I want to thank you for

00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:13,260
supporting the work that Tim's doing

00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:15,510
that was a long list of improvements

00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:17,580
that he's making both in terms of trying

00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:18,930
to connect businesses with the

00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:21,060
evaluators on the site and also

00:34:18,930 --> 00:34:22,710
improving the contribution journey and

00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:24,120
providing the right tools and support

00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:26,880
that our community needs to keep the

00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:28,800
project moving forward and um you know

00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:31,200
I'm just really excited about future

00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:34,080
things that they have coming up trees

00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:37,380
the trees note talked a lot about where

00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:40,680
we need to go next and what markets were

00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:42,510
going into and how there are some people

00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:44,940
being left behind so it's like we want

00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:46,800
to go into ambitious digital experiences

00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:48,540
and we're going to need composer to

00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:50,310
support so that work that some people

00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:53,820
are in other markets and they're

00:34:50,310 --> 00:34:56,220
downloading Drupal and they need support

00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:59,550
and kind of being able to still build a

00:34:56,220 --> 00:35:02,910
site more manually and so we're looking

00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:06,080
at that and then of course you know the

00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:09,960
issue credit system the one that

00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:13,410
calculates contribution by individual

00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:16,080
and then it aggregates it by company you

00:35:13,410 --> 00:35:19,260
know that was built by Tim and his team

00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:20,610
and that's how we note by studying that

00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:25,130
that's how we know that for example

00:35:20,610 --> 00:35:28,020
Europe contributes 44 percent of

00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:30,060
contributes 44 percent of contribution

00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:32,230
right so it's a great tool but the fact

00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:36,310
that we can start expand

00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:39,130
that to support non technical

00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:41,440
contributions really it's really key and

00:35:39,130 --> 00:35:43,090
also I know that businesses are often

00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:46,500
behind camps and so they should get

00:35:43,090 --> 00:35:48,730
recognition in more ways than just

00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:50,560
contribution or financial support as a

00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:52,420
supporting partner and you have just

00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:54,640
really so thankful for everything that

00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:56,440
Tim and his team is doing and it

00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:58,090
couldn't be done without the supporting

00:35:56,440 --> 00:36:01,720
partners funding their work so thank you

00:35:58,090 --> 00:36:03,460
so much if you have questions reach out

00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:05,369
of course you can always reach out to me

00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:09,070
but you also have your account managers

00:36:05,369 --> 00:36:11,140
you can ping us anytime on Twitter

00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:12,490
and of course be on the lookout for our

00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:15,250
monthly email updates

00:36:12,490 --> 00:36:18,790
