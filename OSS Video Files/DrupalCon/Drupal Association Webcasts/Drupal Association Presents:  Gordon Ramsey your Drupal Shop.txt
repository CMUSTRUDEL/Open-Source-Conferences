from a fifty-dollar website to a

00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:30,420
$500,000 scaling in my eight years and I

00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:32,820
did it all the hard way and it wasn't

00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:36,330
kind of towards until towards the very

00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:38,430
end that I started to see oh there's a

00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:41,459
process to this no matter how big or

00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:45,209
small so I hope that no matter what size

00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:48,120
shop you are or what sighs projects you

00:02:45,209 --> 00:02:51,150
work with that you you realize that what

00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:54,450
I'm talking about today you can do a

00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:57,390
tiny bit or a lot of all of these things

00:02:54,450 --> 00:03:00,239
so good morning thank you for being here

00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:04,370
it's really exciting to be part of this

00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:04,370
program with the triple association ah

00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:19,380
so now my keynote won't okay so um thank

00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:24,380
you for surveying who's here because it

00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:24,380
helps me be nice

00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:37,010
Susan it sounds likely out my workshop

00:03:33,349 --> 00:03:38,329
because they aren't getting so yeah it

00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:42,230
sounds like you're having some audio

00:03:38,329 --> 00:03:48,069
option at difficulties so maybe start on

00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:48,069
the beginning yeah okay

00:03:54,069 --> 00:04:01,239
Lauren yes I can hear you now okay so

00:03:59,109 --> 00:04:03,400
I've been consulting for the last four

00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:05,760
years but I have really done everything

00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:11,430
from a fifty-dollar web project to a

00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:11,430
$500,000 web project so i hope that num

00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:32,530
and that you get I narrow skew it more

00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:33,940
to whomever is in the audience Susan I

00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:37,590
hate to interrupt you again at your

00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:42,340
audio keeps going in and out yeah um I'm

00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:46,990
not sure how to alleviate that are you

00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:52,060
using a headset or I am using a headset

00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:53,620
element on the platform so do you have

00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:58,389
everything else closed out on your

00:04:53,620 --> 00:05:00,520
computer other than keynote sorry

00:04:58,389 --> 00:05:05,250
everyone listening I know we're having a

00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:14,289
little difficulties just with technology

00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:15,970
technology technology you want to try

00:05:14,289 --> 00:05:18,120
one more time season and let's see how

00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:18,120
it goes

00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:34,910
thanks everyone for being patient we're

00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:38,350
just working on getting the audio to

00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:38,350
work correctly

00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:58,789
can I am I in the room now yes yes hi

00:05:56,090 --> 00:06:00,919
Susan you sound great I just I decided

00:05:58,789 --> 00:06:03,680
to call in on the phone okay I think

00:06:00,919 --> 00:06:05,599
that there are so many people here that

00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:10,699
we're stressing the bandwidth of them

00:06:05,599 --> 00:06:13,550
God is ok all right ok so all right well

00:06:10,699 --> 00:06:17,470
let's was everything I said internet me

00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:20,389
in the beginning yeah unfortunately

00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:24,259
that's ok well itÃ­s out edit it out

00:06:20,389 --> 00:06:27,470
don't worry haha ok alright so basically

00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:29,569
I while I was gone if you guys had the

00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:32,810
time to get answered the survey that's

00:06:29,569 --> 00:06:34,639
really helpful and then I find that

00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:36,039
people come to my workshop because they

00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:38,780
aren't getting the results they bought

00:06:36,039 --> 00:06:41,419
sometimes they're working very hard but

00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:43,940
they're not making many projects are hit

00:06:41,419 --> 00:06:45,470
and miss a lot of times you think you're

00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:49,009
delivering great but then you're blind

00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:52,220
sided by the client I hear a lot of

00:06:49,009 --> 00:06:54,440
owners sometimes bang well I make my

00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:56,449
team that's just not quite right if I

00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:59,960
had better developers or better project

00:06:56,449 --> 00:07:02,150
managers or better content everything

00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:04,070
would be better but that's not usually

00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:08,030
the case there's usually something else

00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:10,159
is missing and I generally find that

00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:13,969
businesses are funded by cash flow

00:07:10,159 --> 00:07:15,710
rather than margin and they're unsure of

00:07:13,969 --> 00:07:19,099
how to make a useful change how to

00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:22,130
empower team I hear if only my teams

00:07:19,099 --> 00:07:24,380
would take ownership but they're not

00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:27,530
doing the thing that Gordon Ramsay does

00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:30,080
which is they give people authority he

00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:32,389
comes in and says you have the authority

00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:37,400
to do your job and so what does that

00:07:32,389 --> 00:07:39,460
look like but the reason I'm passionate

00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:42,979
about this topic and I spend all my time

00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:46,099
trying to resolve and make companies

00:07:42,979 --> 00:07:49,250
better is that failure hurts Drupal it's

00:07:46,099 --> 00:07:51,680
not happening in one place week delivery

00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:54,590
is happening in a lot of places for a

00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:56,840
lot of people and so what that does is

00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:59,599
that poor implementation hurts all of us

00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:03,289
and I'm passionate about this because if

00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:05,870
we can become more successfully and

00:08:03,289 --> 00:08:08,990
deliver better value to customers

00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:13,850
we can see this number grow rather than

00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:16,940
kind of flat line and the secret to a

00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:18,890
successful Drupal shop or a really any

00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:20,570
shop it doesn't i'm actually working

00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:22,280
with another company that's not in

00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:24,920
truthful and we're doing the same thing

00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:27,830
their secret to a successful shop is

00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:30,130
processed as an owner process gives you

00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:32,480
control without having to micromanage

00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:35,840
process allows people to take ownership

00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:38,600
it allows teams to be energized to

00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:40,460
deliver quality and it unleashes all of

00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:43,540
that talent you have sitting out there

00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:46,340
and so if you have the right people

00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:49,220
doing the right things within a good

00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:53,150
process you create these and

00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:55,430
profitability so how do we get there

00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:58,250
we're going to actually go back to a

00:08:55,430 --> 00:09:00,950
long time ago and think about this as

00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:04,940
schoolhouse rock and if you remember

00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:07,670
there is a great little cartoon and it

00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:09,800
talked about the story of a bill and so

00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:13,280
I'm going to tell you the story of an

00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:15,980
Esso w and how this little sfw travels

00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:21,710
through its entire journey to become a

00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:23,900
successful project so basically what

00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:26,480
happens is that there's one document to

00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:29,660
rule them all it starts out as a side

00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:32,150
audit report and it turns into user data

00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:35,240
think so one of the complaints that I

00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:38,300
get is that Oh updating document is very

00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:41,540
expensive and i'm going to suppose that

00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:43,640
not updating the document is more

00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:47,180
expensive you're spending more money

00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:54,200
more time more energy not doing this

00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:56,330
than you are if you did it so i'm a big

00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:58,790
fan of reverse engineering that's how we

00:09:56,330 --> 00:10:01,490
decide what to build with triple by new

00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:03,890
reverse engineer and so I'm going to

00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:06,320
bring my keynote and i'm going to show

00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:13,760
you where we're trying to get to this

00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:18,880
morning so is this the screen that you

00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:22,150
see ya okay so perfect let's start with

00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:26,170
the architecture document this has been

00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:28,120
in omnigraffle and but you can do it in

00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:32,890
anything that your team is comfortable

00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:35,800
with but at the end of architecture

00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:38,470
before you start development you should

00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:40,450
have something along this line obviously

00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:42,850
for a very small project this might only

00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:46,480
be one or two pages for a very large

00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:50,250
project in my face 60 pages I did a very

00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:53,620
large project with a division / epsc and

00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:58,300
their drizzle teen brought three pages

00:10:53,620 --> 00:11:00,460
of written texts and it was good but

00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:03,490
when we really went through discovery it

00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:07,750
turned into a 39 page document that

00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:11,820
looked like this and so you cover all

00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:23,110
kinds of details you cover user

00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:27,040
storyboards you cover roles permissions

00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:28,360
content types texana me and the stock in

00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:30,810
the Maclaurin process when there's a

00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:35,290
bunch of stuff in it that I just want to

00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:38,830
share any client information you can

00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:40,570
also do it in a spreadsheet and so if

00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:42,370
you look down here at the very bottom

00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:46,330
which I think it's hard for you to see

00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:49,480
Saul weed out the tab you call out your

00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:51,580
field you call out your view modes you

00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:54,160
call out your views all the fields

00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:58,150
interviews and you can see the shade

00:11:54,160 --> 00:12:03,550
name title filter for you call out flags

00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:05,560
no to image styles I can't tell you the

00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:07,660
number of sites that bus to lay because

00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:10,390
at the very end nobody in the beginning

00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:15,510
has predefined image styles that's such

00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:20,080
a basic Google best practice their menus

00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:26,920
panels pains texana me field collections

00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:28,900
usual modules integration content how

00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:31,080
many of you haven't been paid for a site

00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:32,529
because the content never got their

00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:34,420
migrations

00:12:32,529 --> 00:12:39,129
a disease launch strategy performance

00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:42,699
needs training and documentation so this

00:12:39,129 --> 00:12:44,980
is the ideal information that every

00:12:42,699 --> 00:12:48,459
project should start with so your

00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:50,800
tickets have something to have in them

00:12:48,459 --> 00:12:54,370
and we'll talk about tickets at the very

00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:57,850
end a little bit so here we are and this

00:12:54,370 --> 00:13:00,879
is a storyboard and I'll go more into

00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:04,029
detail about this later but this is to

00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:08,139
me the genesis and the simplicity of how

00:13:04,029 --> 00:13:15,610
to talk to clients so now I'm going to

00:13:08,139 --> 00:13:18,519
go back to the Aquino so that was

00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:21,639
starting at the end so now you know we

00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:24,519
were trying to get to what I see though

00:13:21,639 --> 00:13:26,259
is sometimes shops are doing that but

00:13:24,519 --> 00:13:29,079
they didn't bring their clients along

00:13:26,259 --> 00:13:31,420
with them and the clients signed off on

00:13:29,079 --> 00:13:34,720
something they didn't understand makes

00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:37,899
no sense to them and therefore we're

00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:41,100
still unhappy at the end and so it's

00:13:37,899 --> 00:13:43,389
kind of like if I find out sex for 70 I

00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:47,139
really don't know what I'm signing off

00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:49,209
on and so that's why it's important for

00:13:47,139 --> 00:13:52,059
you to bring the client so that when you

00:13:49,209 --> 00:13:58,000
write those engineering specs they also

00:13:52,059 --> 00:14:00,309
have they also have understood what

00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,160
they're getting now I see my screen

00:14:00,309 --> 00:14:12,750
isn't displaying I'm back to my keynote

00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:16,899
so hang on here there we go okay so

00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:21,250
let's go back now to the beginning and I

00:14:16,899 --> 00:14:24,370
have five golden rules if you can't man

00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:27,220
don't play don't take jobs that you're

00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:29,230
not going to knock out of the park take

00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:31,870
them in your sweet spot your realm of

00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:33,970
expertise and create upstream and

00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:35,740
downstream partners to share work with

00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:37,240
you should know shop smaller than you

00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:40,600
and you should know shops bigger than

00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:43,870
you and you should collaborate you

00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:46,000
should decide as a business what kind of

00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:47,800
people you do do you

00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:52,540
have a specialty maybe you do commerce

00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:55,690
maybe you do nonprofit and then become a

00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:57,550
subject matter expert it's good for you

00:14:55,690 --> 00:15:00,160
from a marketing strategy which we can

00:14:57,550 --> 00:15:01,900
talk about another day but deciding

00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:04,510
answers is the company and then

00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:07,720
incentivize your sales people on these

00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:09,850
business ejector it takes discipline to

00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:12,700
say no the projects that there's an

00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:19,870
opportunity cost when you say yes to the

00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:22,720
run project I am working with a client

00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:25,150
now and they were going back and forth

00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:28,150
on a big project and keisha noble the

00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:30,700
client gave you sex and so we're going

00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:33,190
to go China material I said great let me

00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:36,630
see them so I know all of you have seen

00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:40,150
either a rambling 12-page document of

00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:45,540
wishes dreams hugs desires and weirdly

00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:45,540
specific ways to implement something and

00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:54,910
you cannot confuse a client document

00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:59,260
with a scope of work they're very very

00:15:54,910 --> 00:16:01,390
different and so then the idea was that

00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:03,820
oh well we'll go time and materials with

00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:06,940
this client and that everything will be

00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:09,839
okay but it's actually a sucker bet

00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:13,240
because what you're doing is you're

00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:17,110
agreeing with the client that you're

00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:20,050
going to build the weird things in that

00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:22,900
document for the money that he has

00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:26,140
that's the way he's hearing it you're

00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:28,660
hearing Angela theology that he sharing

00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:32,320
something very different so it's

00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:38,800
important that you don't use a client's

00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:41,110
back to begin agile development one of

00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:43,510
the strange things that I see when I

00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:45,580
work with companies and projects is that

00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:47,440
the khania start to learn a little bit

00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:51,070
about Drupal maybe they go to a couple

00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:52,870
of cons they spin up some some sites and

00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:55,540
they hack around a bit or they have an

00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:59,850
internal person that knows some Drupal

00:16:55,540 --> 00:17:03,389
and they start to dictate how you

00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:05,730
drupal no matter how much I've read

00:17:03,389 --> 00:17:08,280
about root canal I never go into my

00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:10,829
dentist and then start dictating how you

00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:13,679
can do that root canal and what kind of

00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:15,510
filling I'm going to get so remember

00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:18,150
that you're the expert and don't let

00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:22,439
that relationship start being the other

00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:27,000
way it's a partnership and so this is

00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:29,309
the first red flag and it's up to you to

00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,960
manage their expectations you have to

00:17:29,309 --> 00:17:34,260
teach them how to succeed at a web

00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:37,140
project sometimes you get a great client

00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:39,840
has gone through several web projects

00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:41,700
and they're very good partners most of

00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:43,470
the time just like these little chicks

00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:46,710
is the first time they're crossing the

00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:50,690
road let your process and experience

00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:56,850
lead the way to success don't let them

00:17:50,690 --> 00:18:00,630
drive the cart and at the end of the day

00:17:56,850 --> 00:18:02,700
just say no they can't make you code I

00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:05,370
can't stand in front of an engineer and

00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:07,320
go write me something right now it

00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:10,770
doesn't work that way so if you don't

00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:12,630
have a deposit if you don't have a clear

00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:15,150
process if you don't have a good

00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:19,230
relationship if you don't have your

00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:22,409
scope of work and you don't have your

00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:25,950
chain spying just don't do it don't

00:18:22,409 --> 00:18:30,210
start working often when someone's in

00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:32,309
one of my workshops I say who's had a

00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:35,370
really badly failed project or

00:18:32,309 --> 00:18:36,990
struggling with something and when they

00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:39,960
raised their hands i always ask them

00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:42,059
when did you know that this was going to

00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:44,760
go off the rails and it's surprisingly

00:18:42,059 --> 00:18:47,760
early like most of the time before

00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:51,419
deposits so listen to your instincts and

00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:53,520
don't put your team through the agony of

00:18:51,419 --> 00:18:57,960
going through a bad project for money

00:18:53,520 --> 00:19:00,690
because you usually don't make any so I

00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:07,740
want to talk not about gene but about a

00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:11,460
gap twice and engineers did not talk the

00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:13,919
same language and

00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:18,450
it's not that the technology failed left

00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:21,510
our communication failed us there's a

00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:24,570
communication gap not a technology here

00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:26,580
and we need to understand that and we

00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:29,130
need to understand how coordinated for

00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:36,809
us to manage that gap the client cannot

00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:39,390
this is all on us unfortunately a web

00:19:36,809 --> 00:19:43,020
project is often a catalyst for a

00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:46,440
complete rewrite of business rules so

00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:48,240
here they are they RT got the whole team

00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:50,730
running towards its web project and then

00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:52,980
you ask them so how do you enroll and

00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:55,350
become a member and everybody has to

00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:57,330
come to a grinding halt because nobody

00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:59,970
knows what that means nobody knows how

00:19:57,330 --> 00:20:02,669
it's done nobody knows what the benefits

00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:05,159
of being a number are and so the whole

00:20:02,669 --> 00:20:07,679
project your team and there comes to a

00:20:05,159 --> 00:20:10,159
grinding halt because nobody sat down

00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:14,909
and made them write their business rules

00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:17,159
before development started sometimes you

00:20:14,909 --> 00:20:21,330
get a client that's all ducks in a row

00:20:17,159 --> 00:20:24,419
but mostly clients are either very

00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:27,299
manual and they type it up on the

00:20:24,419 --> 00:20:30,240
typewriter in basement they bring it up

00:20:27,299 --> 00:20:33,409
someone scans it in and then they fax it

00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:36,059
somewhere and it somehow becomes a PDF

00:20:33,409 --> 00:20:38,250
that isn't a business process that's

00:20:36,059 --> 00:20:41,220
just how they're doing it we have to

00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:42,990
translate that into Drupal for them it

00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:45,570
makes them uncomfortable they don't

00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:52,370
understand the technology but that is

00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:53,779
what our job is one of the biggest

00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:56,299
places I

00:20:53,779 --> 00:20:58,399
see this happen very early on if clients

00:20:56,299 --> 00:21:00,440
start saying what can I have what this

00:20:58,399 --> 00:21:04,460
trip will do I saw this thing over here

00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:07,789
I look at this site and we answer oh you

00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:10,639
can have anything you want and so what

00:21:07,789 --> 00:21:13,159
we've done is we've created this we've

00:21:10,639 --> 00:21:16,489
made that gap bigger because now they're

00:21:13,159 --> 00:21:20,149
dreams hopes and desires get nowhere

00:21:16,489 --> 00:21:22,759
into what they can afford and so it's

00:21:20,149 --> 00:21:27,649
important that we actually control how

00:21:22,759 --> 00:21:29,719
we speak about what they can have so in

00:21:27,649 --> 00:21:33,169
closing the gap one of the things we

00:21:29,719 --> 00:21:37,309
have to have is common language and so

00:21:33,169 --> 00:21:43,009
how do we do that we start out with a

00:21:37,309 --> 00:21:45,009
site audit I'd be curious to know how

00:21:43,009 --> 00:21:49,609
many of you actually do sigh daughters

00:21:45,009 --> 00:21:53,719
but side out of services and they start

00:21:49,609 --> 00:21:55,700
the relationship with open and we can

00:21:53,719 --> 00:22:00,379
talk about the structure of a side of it

00:21:55,700 --> 00:22:02,419
later I'm some aside audit after you

00:22:00,379 --> 00:22:04,279
will reuse their site you've explained

00:22:02,419 --> 00:22:07,669
to them what it's great what isn't great

00:22:04,279 --> 00:22:09,950
and made recommendations you can now

00:22:07,669 --> 00:22:16,190
they love you you're the expert and you

00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:19,070
can now go into the next page one of the

00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:21,200
things that I do is we were looking at

00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:22,909
that gap between now their dreams hopes

00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:25,700
and desires because you told them they

00:22:22,909 --> 00:22:28,519
could have anything they want is that I

00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:33,830
stress there's a lot of the box so

00:22:28,519 --> 00:22:35,509
you've all heard the saying when you're

00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:38,179
a hammer everything looks like a nail

00:22:35,509 --> 00:22:41,239
when you're a Drupal engineer everything

00:22:38,179 --> 00:22:43,129
looks like great custom code but from

00:22:41,239 --> 00:22:46,159
from a business and technology

00:22:43,129 --> 00:22:48,499
standpoint we have to get to a minimum

00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:53,289
viable product with this little

00:22:48,499 --> 00:22:57,649
customization as we can in phase 1 and

00:22:53,289 --> 00:22:59,479
so why would why would I say that like

00:22:57,649 --> 00:23:02,169
you're leaving money on the table the

00:22:59,479 --> 00:23:04,800
client doesn't want to get pushed into

00:23:02,169 --> 00:23:08,280
Drupal out of the box

00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:10,050
into a Minimum Viable Product well there

00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:12,660
are a lot of good reasons for that the

00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:16,490
first is that you get an early win and

00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:19,740
you establish yourself as the expert you

00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:21,800
also get to test the water to see if

00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:25,650
this is a good client and a good project

00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:28,590
maybe everything just comes wheels off

00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:30,900
the bus and if you have engaged into a

00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:33,510
big long expensive thing that you can't

00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:35,760
terminate your step there but if you can

00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:39,240
get them successfully launched with a

00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:42,980
little small product then you have the

00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:45,030
opportunity to go into safe to or not

00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:48,060
the other thing it's about delivering

00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:50,220
value for the client how many of you

00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:52,740
have gone through a project built very

00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:54,870
expensive features and then you go back

00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:57,180
in sixth sense they never launched

00:23:54,870 --> 00:24:00,180
organic groups they never did that big

00:23:57,180 --> 00:24:01,650
newspaper II kind of Content site thing

00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:04,800
that you built all this customization

00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:07,200
and work for four and it's because

00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:10,740
they're imagines needs before launch are

00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:14,010
very different after launch they don't

00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:15,630
often understand how Google works and

00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:19,800
how hard it is to get people to

00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:23,460
contribute and to use a new site and so

00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:26,100
pre building all of those wishes and

00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:30,810
bells and whistles isn't really in their

00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:32,460
best interest and I've ever been on a

00:24:30,810 --> 00:24:34,770
project where the client could afford

00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:36,630
all the features they wanted so it's

00:24:34,770 --> 00:24:39,270
good for you and it's part of agile

00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:42,060
methodology to help prioritize that and

00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:46,500
develop a Minimum Viable Product for

00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:49,440
them remember we're trying to close this

00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:52,680
gap what you really want is this green

00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:55,770
side to be very small and then the blue

00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:58,440
side to be very big because that's your

00:24:55,770 --> 00:24:59,820
margin in this scenario here where

00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:01,920
you're looking at their slides there's

00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:05,430
no margin for you as a business owner

00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:09,210
it's only when it's inverted that you

00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:11,610
can then be covered for all the change

00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:14,270
orders and get the margin that you want

00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:14,270
out of a project

00:25:15,119 --> 00:25:22,690
so what does a site audit and discovery

00:25:18,129 --> 00:25:24,759
look like you go through and look at all

00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:27,279
of these things together with the client

00:25:24,759 --> 00:25:29,950
and the Phi dot you're doing it more

00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:32,349
yourself but then this this framework

00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:36,159
for the site audit also becomes the

00:25:32,349 --> 00:25:38,710
framework for discovery and because now

00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:40,899
you're starting to use this language all

00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:46,389
the way through the communication

00:25:40,899 --> 00:25:50,309
process you start to train them in the

00:25:46,389 --> 00:25:53,440
language hi goddess and discovery

00:25:50,309 --> 00:25:57,159
prioritizes ideas in the quest it helps

00:25:53,440 --> 00:26:02,019
to identify hidden stakeholders I know

00:25:57,159 --> 00:26:05,830
of a few projects where the CEO actually

00:26:02,019 --> 00:26:08,580
came in and they were the vision area

00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:12,219
they said the scope of the project and

00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:15,639
then the trouble was then when the fight

00:26:12,219 --> 00:26:17,769
launched hidden stakeholders showed up

00:26:15,639 --> 00:26:21,519
all over the place well I can't do my

00:26:17,769 --> 00:26:24,279
work where is this where is that they

00:26:21,519 --> 00:26:27,849
had all kinds of needs that were hidden

00:26:24,279 --> 00:26:31,269
all the way through the process on the

00:26:27,849 --> 00:26:33,729
content management side of it and so if

00:26:31,269 --> 00:26:36,190
the site audit and discovery had gone

00:26:33,729 --> 00:26:37,629
through the user stories and storyboards

00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:40,029
and interviewed all those hidden

00:26:37,629 --> 00:26:45,849
stakeholders that project wouldn't have

00:26:40,029 --> 00:26:47,830
failed in that way but now what we're

00:26:45,849 --> 00:26:50,769
doing with this is we're beginning to

00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:54,509
map their vision and ideas into drupal

00:26:50,769 --> 00:26:57,909
language so we're taking their rambling

00:26:54,509 --> 00:27:04,109
15-page manifesto and we're turning it

00:26:57,909 --> 00:27:07,029
into drupal so this is my favorite part

00:27:04,109 --> 00:27:11,739
the truth of the matter is nobody reads

00:27:07,029 --> 00:27:13,570
anymore but sometimes least of all our

00:27:11,739 --> 00:27:16,809
clients because what we're giving them

00:27:13,570 --> 00:27:18,849
to reduce very technical triple is hard

00:27:16,809 --> 00:27:20,739
to understand we forget people don't

00:27:18,849 --> 00:27:22,659
know what a block is they don't know

00:27:20,739 --> 00:27:24,729
what a notice they don't know what

00:27:22,659 --> 00:27:26,900
taxonomy is so we give them this

00:27:24,729 --> 00:27:28,790
document to sign off on

00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:31,600
and again it's like me buying a

00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:34,670
submarine it's pretty worthless on

00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:36,980
documentation the other thing that I

00:27:34,670 --> 00:27:40,130
don't like about word document to

00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:44,660
describe technology is that somewhere

00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:47,180
sometime you're going to put in language

00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:49,100
about video management and then that

00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:51,170
feature is going to come out except

00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:54,110
somewhere in this document in one

00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:56,900
paragraph is dead and you'll be able to

00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:58,460
manage videos and then the clients going

00:27:56,900 --> 00:28:01,790
to bring that back to you at the end it

00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:04,700
goes see you said we'll be able to

00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:07,490
manage videos so those three sentences

00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:12,050
and words in a word document will come

00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:14,300
back to haunt you so I like pictures one

00:28:12,050 --> 00:28:17,150
pictures a thousand words that really

00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:19,760
one picture is clarity and what a

00:28:17,150 --> 00:28:22,670
storyboard does is it illustrates a life

00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:25,160
cycle of each content type user and

00:28:22,670 --> 00:28:28,190
feature and they're based on the user

00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:30,230
story to gather during discovery and you

00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:33,530
can give this back to the client and

00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:36,230
they understand what you're trying to

00:28:33,530 --> 00:28:39,260
accomplish and more importantly

00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:42,230
sometimes is I can create this in

00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:44,150
minutes put it in front of an architect

00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:47,090
and they can read line it in a minute

00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:49,160
there's no parsing that I mean this what

00:28:47,090 --> 00:28:52,250
do I mean by notification is it is it go

00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:55,310
to all of those questions that engineers

00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:57,500
like the button down so I'm going to go

00:28:55,310 --> 00:29:01,660
through this in a little bit more detail

00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:01,660
here because I think it's so much fun

00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:10,880
there's a little bit of a lag between my

00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:14,830
computer and what you're seeing so let

00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:14,830
me see if we can get that to happen

00:29:19,970 --> 00:29:26,270
they're good okay so I start with let me

00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:30,420
make this a little bigger for you I

00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:33,180
start with a little legend nothing

00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:36,590
magical here you can pick your own icon

00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:40,950
set you can do this however you want and

00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:42,570
then i define user roles i can't tell

00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:45,150
you the number of times people go oh we

00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:48,420
just have to users and then as you walk

00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:51,360
through the story of their website many

00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:54,810
many users and many many need start to

00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:57,600
surface we go through their content

00:29:54,810 --> 00:30:01,170
types and then we put it into this very

00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:03,630
simple framework so anybody here who

00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:08,100
isn't in drupal can understand what

00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:12,090
happens an editor creates an organic

00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:14,850
group which sent out an invitation to a

00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:17,910
teacher who logs into drupal and goes to

00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:20,250
my account really straightforward and

00:30:17,910 --> 00:30:24,480
then you can narrate that a little bit

00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:27,930
if you like and now we can see the next

00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:31,170
step the teacher comes out email

00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:34,290
notification to the student who logs

00:30:31,170 --> 00:30:39,210
into drupal you go to my account and now

00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:41,280
is part of the organic group and let's

00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:44,730
talk about that in terms of a piece of

00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:47,100
content so a teacher creates a content

00:30:44,730 --> 00:30:52,590
type they're able to upload a picture

00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:55,890
some content a video and a bio they save

00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:58,440
it and it goes through workflow then if

00:30:55,890 --> 00:31:03,090
I continue this story line then the next

00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:05,070
one would show the editor moderating

00:31:03,090 --> 00:31:08,160
this piece of content and publishing it

00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:10,170
to the web but what's so great about

00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:14,340
this is you can see right here if you

00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:21,930
look at where my cursor is if I didn't

00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:25,410
have bio and video on this document it's

00:31:21,930 --> 00:31:27,870
very evident that it's not here and then

00:31:25,410 --> 00:31:30,420
later because this document becomes the

00:31:27,870 --> 00:31:32,550
user acceptance testing and the scope of

00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:34,530
work and everything else

00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:37,440
when they when the cunning comes back

00:31:34,530 --> 00:31:39,960
and goes where's my video and bio you

00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:42,720
can go back to this document and you can

00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:45,450
say oh it's not a problem that we can

00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:48,870
add it however it was never part of the

00:31:45,450 --> 00:31:53,010
original scope of work this takes your

00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:56,400
protection against scope creep and I

00:31:53,010 --> 00:31:58,740
think that is pretty cool if you don't

00:31:56,400 --> 00:32:04,140
take away anything else the sides of

00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:09,800
this it'll be great okay I see you're

00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:09,800
not back yet let's see if we can get

00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:28,630
back on my keynote but I think there's

00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:30,130
still a leg so I'm going to keep talking

00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:35,020
so one of the things that are very

00:32:30,130 --> 00:32:37,420
important is actually user dashboards we

00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:40,330
have a strange thing in Drupal where we

00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:44,260
are building a content management system

00:32:40,330 --> 00:32:47,200
and as companies we forget that Google

00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:50,800
doesn't natively and intuitively provide

00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:54,370
the M part it's common for us to build

00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:58,120
out a Google site where the users can

00:32:54,370 --> 00:33:02,500
actually get to the managing content

00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:09,790
part and so we have to actually start by

00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:11,860
building the dashboard I I've worked on

00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:13,929
many flights where I'm like how do I get

00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:16,059
here and they're like oh well you have

00:33:13,929 --> 00:33:18,640
to go edit blocks well it just roll

00:33:16,059 --> 00:33:22,600
doesn't have permission to do that or oh

00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:25,870
we put that in the template or yeah

00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:28,600
that's just some HTML and all those

00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:31,290
things no matter how brilliantly you

00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:33,429
deliver the product it's a client

00:33:31,290 --> 00:33:36,130
stakeholders the people who live and

00:33:33,429 --> 00:33:37,929
breed on the site for a living can't get

00:33:36,130 --> 00:33:41,050
to their content they're not going to be

00:33:37,929 --> 00:33:44,710
happy and this is one of the areas where

00:33:41,050 --> 00:33:47,200
drupal gets a black eye how do we fix

00:33:44,710 --> 00:33:50,650
that well one of the things we do in

00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:53,440
discovery is we filled out the dashboard

00:33:50,650 --> 00:33:55,809
and what the dashboard does that those

00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:58,540
two things one it helps the client start

00:33:55,809 --> 00:34:00,820
to understand what they're going to get

00:33:58,540 --> 00:34:05,559
and how they're going to manage it and

00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:09,129
this reduces fear and risk the second

00:34:05,559 --> 00:34:14,409
thing is they are often terrible at

00:34:09,129 --> 00:34:16,300
explaining their own processes and by

00:34:14,409 --> 00:34:21,750
building the dashboard and reverse

00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:26,619
engineering this for them you can help

00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:30,589
surface problems that are going to come

00:34:26,619 --> 00:34:35,059
back later and so sometime

00:34:30,589 --> 00:34:38,479
as the more complexity is the more value

00:34:35,059 --> 00:34:41,299
this will have for you like what who has

00:34:38,479 --> 00:34:42,979
to edit plot plan and they don't know

00:34:41,299 --> 00:34:46,009
about workflow they don't know about

00:34:42,979 --> 00:34:49,159
revision they don't know about drupal

00:34:46,009 --> 00:34:50,509
views and so by building the dashboard

00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:52,549
and letting them see how they're going

00:34:50,509 --> 00:34:56,690
to manage it they can start to express

00:34:52,549 --> 00:34:59,269
oh where do i edit my log book what do

00:34:56,690 --> 00:35:01,099
you mean log book oh we have this thing

00:34:59,269 --> 00:35:04,749
it's the most important thing we do on

00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:07,130
the site where do I manage my journeys

00:35:04,749 --> 00:35:09,890
what our journeys we never talked about

00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:12,380
that so these are the kinds of things

00:35:09,890 --> 00:35:14,660
that having the dashboard engages the

00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:16,819
client because they do know how they're

00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:19,099
doing their work now they just don't

00:35:16,819 --> 00:35:21,859
know how they'll be doing it in Drupal

00:35:19,099 --> 00:35:24,019
and this dashboard helps make sure that

00:35:21,859 --> 00:35:31,339
you close the gap and you're creating

00:35:24,019 --> 00:35:33,349
common language around that so one of

00:35:31,339 --> 00:35:35,630
the things that I see happen quite

00:35:33,349 --> 00:35:38,119
commonly is that everyone starts out

00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:41,930
with a very good intention they get

00:35:38,119 --> 00:35:44,420
maybe to this point and then there's

00:35:41,930 --> 00:35:47,210
some sign off somewhere and then just

00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:49,700
becomes a dusty moldy piece of paper way

00:35:47,210 --> 00:35:52,670
back in Google Drive and no one looks at

00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:56,420
it again that is a terrible way to

00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:58,940
manage this process and what has to

00:35:56,420 --> 00:36:02,900
happen is however you do it whether you

00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:05,599
post it on a wall you have binders you

00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:08,210
pull it up in elephant notes in base

00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:10,670
camp inside that ticketing thing that

00:36:08,210 --> 00:36:13,430
all of these things have to be present

00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:16,609
at every meeting along the way it's a

00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:20,479
living breathing document that has to

00:36:16,609 --> 00:36:22,489
constantly be touched again so your team

00:36:20,479 --> 00:36:23,930
might be guessing something but they

00:36:22,489 --> 00:36:26,390
better be discussing it along the

00:36:23,930 --> 00:36:28,519
framework of what's already been

00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:30,559
approved and this is where I see a lot

00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:32,569
of stirring up the path and you kind of

00:36:30,559 --> 00:36:35,119
sport development without meaning to

00:36:32,569 --> 00:36:37,099
like oh this is a really great idea and

00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:39,319
this would be better this way but it

00:36:37,099 --> 00:36:42,079
actually deviates from what the client

00:36:39,319 --> 00:36:45,049
is expecting and has paid for and maybe

00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:47,779
this new better way is something that

00:36:45,049 --> 00:36:52,759
you can get a change order for and get

00:36:47,779 --> 00:36:57,640
paid to do so now we're going to take a

00:36:52,759 --> 00:37:01,039
little sidebar this is where one of the

00:36:57,640 --> 00:37:03,799
basic tenants of technology is you

00:37:01,039 --> 00:37:08,690
accrue technical debt and nobody has

00:37:03,799 --> 00:37:11,329
this conversation with clients so you

00:37:08,690 --> 00:37:13,609
need to explain to them what technical

00:37:11,329 --> 00:37:16,400
debt is and who owns it and they're

00:37:13,609 --> 00:37:20,420
going to be very surprised that they own

00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:22,969
it but where we fall down is that we

00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:25,069
don't share with them each time they

00:37:22,969 --> 00:37:30,049
encourage that technical debt and let

00:37:25,069 --> 00:37:33,410
them make a choice between option a and

00:37:30,049 --> 00:37:39,140
option B so what happens it's like that

00:37:33,410 --> 00:37:40,640
flight where the engineer says to the

00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:44,029
client you can have anything you want

00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:46,219
and so the client says oh I want to

00:37:44,029 --> 00:37:49,099
integrate with Twitter and I want to do

00:37:46,219 --> 00:37:52,640
it like this and they go okay great and

00:37:49,099 --> 00:37:55,190
you flip out a change order for it but

00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:57,979
you don't explain to them that if they

00:37:55,190 --> 00:38:00,589
had done it this way its struggle out of

00:37:57,979 --> 00:38:03,529
the box and stays within their minimal

00:38:00,589 --> 00:38:06,829
product parameters if they make it with

00:38:03,529 --> 00:38:09,049
this subtle request it becomes a custom

00:38:06,829 --> 00:38:13,009
module that they have to maintain over

00:38:09,049 --> 00:38:16,249
time we ran into that with a very big

00:38:13,009 --> 00:38:18,109
client and they wanted the little

00:38:16,249 --> 00:38:19,789
overlay on the photograph so you roll

00:38:18,109 --> 00:38:23,630
over the photograph and you get a mobile

00:38:19,789 --> 00:38:25,999
box great tons of modules do that but

00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:29,660
then they wanted the caption and that

00:38:25,999 --> 00:38:32,029
choice to have the caption is what made

00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:34,489
it a custom module and it doesn't seem

00:38:32,029 --> 00:38:37,969
like it should be that hard but it was

00:38:34,489 --> 00:38:40,279
and so they asked for it the team

00:38:37,969 --> 00:38:44,210
started running to build it no like time

00:38:40,279 --> 00:38:46,640
out did they actually approve the

00:38:44,210 --> 00:38:48,799
technical debt and the complexity of

00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:51,259
having there and they're like no but

00:38:48,799 --> 00:38:53,059
they said it was really important so we

00:38:51,259 --> 00:38:57,410
had to roll back and then offer the

00:38:53,059 --> 00:38:59,930
clients a choice free now and of course

00:38:57,410 --> 00:39:04,040
free but I mean no technical depth now

00:38:59,930 --> 00:39:07,520
and you can have it now or technical

00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:10,760
debt and custom and delay of project and

00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:13,700
they start to go free now and take on

00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:16,130
the technical debt later so that's a

00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:18,310
good example of we're not letting the

00:39:16,130 --> 00:39:21,050
client drive development is really

00:39:18,310 --> 00:39:24,680
important and letting them make this

00:39:21,050 --> 00:39:28,100
choice and I've got some good examples

00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:33,580
of that is implementing solar / Drupal

00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:36,290
search for panels versus blocks and you

00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:38,930
know several things in that genre so how

00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:40,700
I do that is I love doing this these are

00:39:38,930 --> 00:39:43,070
three by three Brits are used everywhere

00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:44,870
but I use them with a client because

00:39:43,070 --> 00:39:46,430
you're not trying to argue with them

00:39:44,870 --> 00:39:50,060
you're letting them make an informed

00:39:46,430 --> 00:39:53,120
choice and so what you do is you ask

00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:55,010
them with all of that 15 page documents

00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:57,080
which are the must-haves which are the

00:39:55,010 --> 00:40:00,950
wanted which are the like to have and

00:39:57,080 --> 00:40:03,140
then you explain to them which are the

00:40:00,950 --> 00:40:06,260
minimal best things in which are the

00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:09,260
high depth issues so you can see in this

00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:12,440
scenario that something that they would

00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:15,980
like to have but a very high technical

00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:19,400
debt they will likely for go if you give

00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:23,330
your client this matrix to make

00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:26,180
decisions from they themselves will

00:40:23,330 --> 00:40:32,120
navigate themselves into into safe

00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:35,300
waters so very important you can also do

00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:39,110
it with risk they might be asking for

00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:40,970
something that is very risky no one's

00:40:39,110 --> 00:40:43,670
done it not only have you not done it

00:40:40,970 --> 00:40:47,680
but no one has done it and it falls into

00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:50,720
this heavy custom high-risk area

00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:53,510
sometimes it's essential so if you look

00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:57,050
at it across here it's a must-have with

00:40:53,510 --> 00:41:00,250
a very high debt and so but helping

00:40:57,050 --> 00:41:04,760
clients understand your Drupal

00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:07,040
technology decisions is key too many

00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:10,960
times I see companies drive forward with

00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:10,960
very custom high risk

00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:17,880
decisions without really letting the

00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:17,880
customer know the facts what's happening

00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:26,560
another little sidebar is designed I

00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:30,570
know it happens and it can be okay but I

00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:33,940
really do not like design that precede

00:41:30,570 --> 00:41:35,950
engineering I don't mind a home page or

00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:38,980
you know look and feel kind of thing but

00:41:35,950 --> 00:41:42,119
sometimes you'll get 25 Photoshop files

00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:46,570
of every single page mapped out

00:41:42,119 --> 00:41:49,180
wireframes galore and the trouble is

00:41:46,570 --> 00:41:51,430
nothing's been engineered what the heck

00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:54,400
is why are trained if there has been no

00:41:51,430 --> 00:41:59,010
functionality to find it kind of like to

00:41:54,400 --> 00:42:02,230
me because I use actually be in

00:41:59,010 --> 00:42:04,300
contracting and interior design is like

00:42:02,230 --> 00:42:06,430
why would i order all my wallpaper

00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:09,550
before the house has been laid out on a

00:42:06,430 --> 00:42:12,070
blueprint I can do all of that after

00:42:09,550 --> 00:42:13,869
there's a blueprint but I can't do it in

00:42:12,070 --> 00:42:15,760
advance with a blueprint so your

00:42:13,869 --> 00:42:19,750
engineering sector the blueprint and

00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:23,980
then on to that you do your wire frames

00:42:19,750 --> 00:42:27,010
and your your divine Susan we have a

00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:29,260
question really quickly yes I'm sorry we

00:42:27,010 --> 00:42:31,060
might in swimming you note I can't see

00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:33,700
my thing so thanks for interrupting me

00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:36,849
no no problem at all how do you manage

00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:38,530
fixed price projects in particular ones

00:42:36,849 --> 00:42:40,960
that are through public tendering

00:42:38,530 --> 00:42:42,369
processes and you have to put in a fixed

00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:44,710
price and promised to deliver everything

00:42:42,369 --> 00:42:49,119
the client everything within the clients

00:42:44,710 --> 00:42:51,930
back so that's always tricky but what I

00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:56,230
would do because when you get those rfps

00:42:51,930 --> 00:42:58,660
and you know ideally you get to a point

00:42:56,230 --> 00:43:01,210
where you don't have to reduce those but

00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:02,380
that's not a reality for everybody and

00:43:01,210 --> 00:43:04,960
sometimes they're really good they're

00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:08,609
high profile things like that but what

00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:12,460
you can do is actually take that

00:43:08,609 --> 00:43:15,810
document and counterproposal it in other

00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:19,690
words sometimes what's in those things

00:43:15,810 --> 00:43:22,030
don't exactly have to be that way and so

00:43:19,690 --> 00:43:23,990
what I would do let's say the budget is

00:43:22,030 --> 00:43:26,450
200 thousand volts

00:43:23,990 --> 00:43:28,400
or a hundred thousand dollars I would

00:43:26,450 --> 00:43:30,530
actually look and see what you can build

00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:34,070
for that and reverse-engineer it and

00:43:30,530 --> 00:43:37,520
make that your offer and maybe you don't

00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:39,440
get paid and you don't win the bid but

00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:42,160
the trouble is if it was a three hundred

00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:46,220
thousand dollar project inside of a

00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:48,080
two-hundred-thousand-dollar budget I'm

00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:49,790
not really sure that fourth winning

00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:52,130
anyway is it really worked a hundred

00:43:49,790 --> 00:43:53,960
thousand dollars like if you took a

00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:55,850
hundred thousand dollars and did awesome

00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:59,060
marketing wouldn't it get you more

00:43:55,850 --> 00:44:01,910
better work so i'm not sure that losing

00:43:59,060 --> 00:44:04,460
money on a project is ever really a good

00:44:01,910 --> 00:44:06,170
idea but i would take that i would be

00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:08,300
the storyboards i would do these are

00:44:06,170 --> 00:44:10,250
stories i would i would wow them with

00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:13,490
your presentation on what they can

00:44:10,250 --> 00:44:16,880
really have for that money and a

00:44:13,490 --> 00:44:20,090
simplified version at MVP of it and i've

00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:22,400
seen that be successful because they

00:44:20,090 --> 00:44:26,000
don't know like when you're writing the

00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:30,980
rfp you don't know what the actual costs

00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:33,500
are and so I say that you tailor that

00:44:30,980 --> 00:44:35,630
that you're comfortable and proud to

00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:37,430
deliver it nobody likes to work on a

00:44:35,630 --> 00:44:39,320
project where you're losing money you're

00:44:37,430 --> 00:44:41,119
burning development hours you have to

00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:43,520
turn away some other cool projects that

00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:46,609
came in because you're in the hole for

00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:48,530
this project you have to finish all that

00:44:46,609 --> 00:44:51,500
happens the Debbie buddy hates working

00:44:48,530 --> 00:44:53,080
on it and then this is where you as the

00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:57,410
business owner making this decision

00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:59,900
really burden your team you made them

00:44:57,410 --> 00:45:01,730
unhappy on purpose and that's not good

00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:04,640
it's not necessarily good business

00:45:01,730 --> 00:45:06,320
decision to go after those things that

00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:09,410
aren't actually winnable remember that

00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:11,300
was one of my first rules only take

00:45:09,410 --> 00:45:13,880
project where you can win and there are

00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:17,570
many reasons why projects fails and that

00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:20,510
is one of them you see this quite often

00:45:17,570 --> 00:45:23,600
in the Drupal community a shot blows up

00:45:20,510 --> 00:45:26,060
to 20 30 40 people and then they're back

00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:27,800
down to five well you know why they

00:45:26,060 --> 00:45:31,190
check on one of those projects is

00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:35,300
usually the answer is that something is

00:45:31,190 --> 00:45:37,130
look like a big magic magic wish that

00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:37,700
happened but what really happened is

00:45:37,130 --> 00:45:41,840
that it

00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:43,610
today at sponsorship and so I always say

00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:44,780
like it's either good business or it's

00:45:43,610 --> 00:45:47,330
not it's either a good client

00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:49,730
relationship or it's not and anybody who

00:45:47,330 --> 00:45:53,270
puts out an RFP and its really

00:45:49,730 --> 00:45:57,440
determined to squeeze the blood out of a

00:45:53,270 --> 00:46:03,170
rock why do you want to do that block so

00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:08,840
that's what I would say okay let's go to

00:46:03,170 --> 00:46:12,320
estimating so no shops are very good at

00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:15,170
estimating this like they understand who

00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:16,880
built one and when it's delivered I have

00:46:15,170 --> 00:46:18,770
all kinds of opinions about how to do

00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:25,010
that better but that's not part of this

00:46:18,770 --> 00:46:27,980
workshop but the problem is is that a

00:46:25,010 --> 00:46:32,140
real project has these three phases and

00:46:27,980 --> 00:46:35,540
we've spent you know 40 ton slides and

00:46:32,140 --> 00:46:39,320
most of the time this morning talking

00:46:35,540 --> 00:46:41,240
about the other two because they're more

00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:43,330
important than development if you don't

00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:45,890
do analysis and project planning

00:46:43,330 --> 00:46:48,380
development is just group growth and

00:46:45,890 --> 00:46:54,290
you're just burning hours that you don't

00:46:48,380 --> 00:46:57,400
need to so these are the steps inside of

00:46:54,290 --> 00:46:59,390
those three areas there's a lot to

00:46:57,400 --> 00:47:02,900
understand before you get into

00:46:59,390 --> 00:47:08,210
development and what we're really

00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:10,010
talking about is closing this gap right

00:47:08,210 --> 00:47:11,870
and that's what we're doing by going

00:47:10,010 --> 00:47:14,540
through business and analysis and

00:47:11,870 --> 00:47:16,490
project planning is that now we have

00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:18,530
created common language you understand

00:47:16,490 --> 00:47:20,540
their stuff they understand yourself and

00:47:18,530 --> 00:47:22,640
i will say whenever you take clients

00:47:20,540 --> 00:47:25,160
through business analysis and project

00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:28,100
planning the light bulb comes on for

00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:30,650
them how complex the thing that you're

00:47:28,100 --> 00:47:33,590
building because you know that this Oh

00:47:30,650 --> 00:47:36,290
Drupal is free why am I paying you so

00:47:33,590 --> 00:47:38,060
much if I can get the code for free when

00:47:36,290 --> 00:47:40,730
you're explaining this to them and

00:47:38,060 --> 00:47:42,710
you're helping them understand that the

00:47:40,730 --> 00:47:48,280
expensive part is translating their

00:47:42,710 --> 00:47:48,280
business model into Drupal

00:47:50,730 --> 00:47:55,450
get a lot of pushback from people

00:47:53,110 --> 00:47:57,180
because they say what I'm talking about

00:47:55,450 --> 00:47:59,890
is too expensive and time-consuming

00:47:57,180 --> 00:48:01,840
especially like a smaller shop you know

00:47:59,890 --> 00:48:05,010
maybe your two or three people and

00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:08,710
you're like I don't have time to do this

00:48:05,010 --> 00:48:10,750
but ignoring this that doesn't mean you

00:48:08,710 --> 00:48:13,600
were successful at by passing them it

00:48:10,750 --> 00:48:15,700
just means that you spent the time and

00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:18,610
money somewhere else when it was more

00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:23,110
expensive money so if you spend the time

00:48:18,610 --> 00:48:26,020
up front you might have one person doing

00:48:23,110 --> 00:48:28,690
it at one or two people at two hundred

00:48:26,020 --> 00:48:31,510
dollars an hour but if you do it later

00:48:28,690 --> 00:48:33,100
and your team is in group grope mode you

00:48:31,510 --> 00:48:35,440
might be burning five or eight hundred

00:48:33,100 --> 00:48:37,300
dollars an hour so you burn the time

00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:40,590
whether you charge for it or not and

00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:43,030
whether you do it or not and that's why

00:48:40,590 --> 00:48:45,160
projects often don't have any margin and

00:48:43,030 --> 00:48:48,040
the question you have to ask yourself

00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:50,170
with how valuable is it to me to finish

00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:52,480
quicker without impediments and without

00:48:50,170 --> 00:48:54,700
errors because we're talking about

00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:57,940
velocity and velocity is where your

00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:59,680
margin is the other thing that I see and

00:48:57,940 --> 00:49:02,020
I'm working with a company right now on

00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:05,320
this is their bidding at a very large

00:49:02,020 --> 00:49:09,160
project with 17,000 different little

00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:11,440
side projects and they're they're

00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:15,220
looking at it is how much of how much

00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:19,690
actual manpower is this going to take

00:49:15,220 --> 00:49:21,700
and what they forgot to do is because

00:49:19,690 --> 00:49:23,410
they are now taking this one hundred

00:49:21,700 --> 00:49:24,820
thousand dollar project and trying to

00:49:23,410 --> 00:49:28,480
throw a hundred thousand dollars worth

00:49:24,820 --> 00:49:30,040
of well that's the one metric because

00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:32,230
you have to take out something for

00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:34,480
margin and these are just you know wreck

00:49:32,230 --> 00:49:36,520
numbers you take out what you actually

00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:38,530
have your overhead might be fifty

00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:39,910
percent of your business like you have

00:49:38,530 --> 00:49:41,680
to know what your over and it is and

00:49:39,910 --> 00:49:45,100
what Morgan you want to end it here but

00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:46,690
let's just say your margin is ten

00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:48,970
percent that's the padding you'd like to

00:49:46,690 --> 00:49:51,370
have on every project your overhead is

00:49:48,970 --> 00:49:53,230
running at 20 and so now what you have

00:49:51,370 --> 00:49:55,630
left to throw at the project is

00:49:53,230 --> 00:49:58,150
development you go great that should be

00:49:55,630 --> 00:49:59,800
about 700 of ours well it doesn't work

00:49:58,150 --> 00:50:03,490
out like that either

00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:07,060
so this is more how you should allocate

00:50:03,490 --> 00:50:08,710
that seven thousand dollars and this is

00:50:07,060 --> 00:50:10,570
where I see a lot of company get in

00:50:08,710 --> 00:50:13,210
trouble the project budget was okay but

00:50:10,570 --> 00:50:16,300
they didn't pre plan to allocate

00:50:13,210 --> 00:50:20,950
resources in the right manner so this is

00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:23,140
what it should look like in my mind and

00:50:20,950 --> 00:50:26,860
if you look down here at the very end I

00:50:23,140 --> 00:50:28,390
had fifteen percent u18 are bugs and you

00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:29,680
can make this pan or you can make it

00:50:28,390 --> 00:50:32,980
five you can make it whatever you like

00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:35,740
however you must have something left at

00:50:32,980 --> 00:50:38,530
the end after user acceptance testing to

00:50:35,740 --> 00:50:41,710
do what I call feature college there are

00:50:38,530 --> 00:50:44,140
things that are not going to be wrong

00:50:41,710 --> 00:50:48,580
but there are things that they're going

00:50:44,140 --> 00:50:51,490
to legitimately want to be different and

00:50:48,580 --> 00:50:54,310
you have to give them the budget to do

00:50:51,490 --> 00:50:56,880
that you can't try to get another 1500

00:50:54,310 --> 00:51:00,580
out of them I've never seen a project

00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:07,240
launch without this so why is it that we

00:51:00,580 --> 00:51:10,630
don't have a line item 22 to allocate to

00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:12,520
it and I actually put this in the book

00:51:10,630 --> 00:51:15,190
of work that we have allocated there

00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:18,880
provides and future college not new

00:51:15,190 --> 00:51:21,250
features feature polish and believe it

00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:22,600
or not honey no question this because if

00:51:21,250 --> 00:51:24,220
they've gone through any kind of

00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:26,860
development they know and once you

00:51:24,220 --> 00:51:28,450
explain it to them they understand but

00:51:26,860 --> 00:51:30,790
launching a site the health and has a

00:51:28,450 --> 00:51:32,860
lot of great areas let's just be honest

00:51:30,790 --> 00:51:37,930
about that acknowledge it and put it in

00:51:32,860 --> 00:51:39,730
as a line item cover ourselves if you

00:51:37,930 --> 00:51:42,220
feel really weird about it say if we

00:51:39,730 --> 00:51:48,130
don't use it we'll refund it like but

00:51:42,220 --> 00:51:49,830
allocate for so the quarterback every

00:51:48,130 --> 00:51:52,480
good team has to have a quarterback

00:51:49,830 --> 00:51:55,120
Gordon Ramsey comes in he acts as a

00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:58,720
temporary quarterback but the

00:51:55,120 --> 00:52:00,580
quarterback is calling the shot but

00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:04,270
they're not running down the field in

00:52:00,580 --> 00:52:06,400
doing things so as an owner or as the

00:52:04,270 --> 00:52:08,230
lead engineer like think about how much

00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:12,490
your quarterbacking and how much you're

00:52:08,230 --> 00:52:13,420
doing but the quarterback in a drupal

00:52:12,490 --> 00:52:17,160
shop is the pride

00:52:13,420 --> 00:52:21,819
manages and this really surprises people

00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:24,190
and it's why if you're an engineer if

00:52:21,819 --> 00:52:27,000
your drupal guy and you're working with

00:52:24,190 --> 00:52:29,859
two or three people and you're you're

00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:31,780
doing pretty well the first person you

00:52:29,859 --> 00:52:36,220
have to scale up to if you want to grow

00:52:31,780 --> 00:52:39,040
as a project manager there is valuable

00:52:36,220 --> 00:52:43,359
as engineers so the heart of every

00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:45,760
project the reason project managers fail

00:52:43,359 --> 00:52:48,960
is because they're always given a lot of

00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:51,549
responsibility but no true Authority

00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:56,140
I'll say that five more times if it

00:52:51,549 --> 00:52:58,240
helps project managers impact every part

00:52:56,140 --> 00:53:00,069
of your company and done well that's

00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:03,309
just a key position for profitable

00:53:00,069 --> 00:53:06,700
projects so if you look at this they fit

00:53:03,309 --> 00:53:08,500
at the center sales engineering the

00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:11,290
customer although you might also have

00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:13,750
account managers they're part of the QA

00:53:11,290 --> 00:53:20,950
demo and they're responsible for change

00:53:13,750 --> 00:53:23,579
orders and so without them the project

00:53:20,950 --> 00:53:26,799
pretty much comes to a grinding halt

00:53:23,579 --> 00:53:30,430
they're also over overworked if you look

00:53:26,799 --> 00:53:32,890
at what they're supposed to do they

00:53:30,430 --> 00:53:37,299
can't manage six or eight projects as

00:53:32,890 --> 00:53:39,369
ridiculous but how do you know if your

00:53:37,299 --> 00:53:40,930
project managers doing a good job well

00:53:39,369 --> 00:53:43,750
the first thing is have a good process

00:53:40,930 --> 00:53:45,309
and this is what allows you to give them

00:53:43,750 --> 00:53:48,940
the authority to manage client

00:53:45,309 --> 00:53:50,950
expectation teams and tap if you don't

00:53:48,940 --> 00:53:53,230
give them to Authority all they are

00:53:50,950 --> 00:53:55,660
doing is running back and forth putting

00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:58,809
out fires conveying week messages and

00:53:55,660 --> 00:54:00,190
they're holding the project together but

00:53:58,809 --> 00:54:03,339
they're not doing their job effectively

00:54:00,190 --> 00:54:09,220
and this creates burnout dress for

00:54:03,339 --> 00:54:10,630
everybody so at the end of a sprint and

00:54:09,220 --> 00:54:12,940
if you don't do sprints at the end of

00:54:10,630 --> 00:54:16,420
your project or milestone or whatever

00:54:12,940 --> 00:54:19,089
you do is the project manager has a lot

00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:21,190
of work they create the top line tickets

00:54:19,089 --> 00:54:23,440
for the next sprint they allocate

00:54:21,190 --> 00:54:25,720
resources to those tickets they monitor

00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:27,020
the bills along the way they watch the

00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:30,250
burn rate for the

00:54:27,020 --> 00:54:32,900
company owner they do QA and testing

00:54:30,250 --> 00:54:37,490
they demo to the client they get the

00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:40,340
feedback they update the docks it's a

00:54:37,490 --> 00:54:44,930
very very important rule this is what

00:54:40,340 --> 00:54:46,760
keeps your project on track and so

00:54:44,930 --> 00:54:49,310
without controls you have no velocity

00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:51,440
this is kind of gridlock that I've seen

00:54:49,310 --> 00:54:55,240
a lot of projects they run late be

00:54:51,440 --> 00:55:02,330
behind their over budget and this is why

00:54:55,240 --> 00:55:04,460
so the important part about a project

00:55:02,330 --> 00:55:07,610
manager is that they measure sprint and

00:55:04,460 --> 00:55:11,270
they are they are empowered to look at

00:55:07,610 --> 00:55:14,120
three things for you the first is what

00:55:11,270 --> 00:55:17,210
are the hours that we fold what are the

00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:21,050
hours engineers estimated and what are

00:55:17,210 --> 00:55:23,270
the actual our views and then they have

00:55:21,050 --> 00:55:26,450
to try and match that to how far along

00:55:23,270 --> 00:55:28,280
you are in the actual bill so that you

00:55:26,450 --> 00:55:31,040
can see that you've actually burned

00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:32,570
through fifty percent of the money and

00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:35,300
you're a thirty percent of the way done

00:55:32,570 --> 00:55:37,130
and this is this is your early warning

00:55:35,300 --> 00:55:39,800
signal that a project is going to be off

00:55:37,130 --> 00:55:42,050
track they also are responsible for

00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:44,150
tracking and making sure that change

00:55:42,050 --> 00:55:46,280
orders happens and I'd be curious to

00:55:44,150 --> 00:55:49,490
know how may be put in change orders as

00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:55,330
a process maybe we can add that as a

00:55:49,490 --> 00:55:58,910
question the other thing is a language

00:55:55,330 --> 00:56:02,570
so in agile they have this great word

00:55:58,910 --> 00:56:04,520
called backlog backlog works when you

00:56:02,570 --> 00:56:07,580
get paid to show up for work regardless

00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:10,400
of what you do it doesn't work inside of

00:56:07,580 --> 00:56:13,910
our trying to deliver projects from

00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:17,270
honey environments what you do when you

00:56:13,910 --> 00:56:19,310
say put things in backlog is everything

00:56:17,270 --> 00:56:21,710
you ever talked about with a client in

00:56:19,310 --> 00:56:25,250
that backlog is a promise that you will

00:56:21,710 --> 00:56:27,260
deliberate in the original scope so

00:56:25,250 --> 00:56:30,560
you're promising to do work for free

00:56:27,260 --> 00:56:33,230
when you use the term backlog you have

00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:36,410
to create clarity and parse things into

00:56:33,230 --> 00:56:38,780
four separate pockets there are the same

00:56:36,410 --> 00:56:40,790
Center bug fix there are the things that

00:56:38,780 --> 00:56:43,370
are in scope that you're going to cover

00:56:40,790 --> 00:56:45,920
another sprint there are things that are

00:56:43,370 --> 00:56:51,170
out of scope but you're going to do them

00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:53,150
now like it makes sense maybe adding the

00:56:51,170 --> 00:56:56,360
photo gallery or laying the groundwork

00:56:53,150 --> 00:56:58,910
for translation and so but they're not

00:56:56,360 --> 00:57:01,550
in scope and you have to create a change

00:56:58,910 --> 00:57:04,370
order and there are other things that

00:57:01,550 --> 00:57:07,940
are out of scope that you're going to do

00:57:04,370 --> 00:57:10,130
in the next day because they're too big

00:57:07,940 --> 00:57:12,800
to bring on the required discovering

00:57:10,130 --> 00:57:16,700
architecture and is really break out of

00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:19,330
the MVP box or that they're just not

00:57:16,700 --> 00:57:22,550
important to do now for the project if

00:57:19,330 --> 00:57:24,110
you want all of that into backlog the

00:57:22,550 --> 00:57:27,440
client will come ask you at the end of

00:57:24,110 --> 00:57:30,220
the project and stay if you recall we

00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:33,590
talked about fill in the blank here and

00:57:30,220 --> 00:57:36,830
you say you would do it that's what

00:57:33,590 --> 00:57:38,990
backlog turns into so be sure that all

00:57:36,830 --> 00:57:41,270
of the conversations at the end of every

00:57:38,990 --> 00:57:50,750
sprint get parsed into one of these four

00:57:41,270 --> 00:57:54,730
buckets so now by this time we are now

00:57:50,750 --> 00:57:57,560
all the way into the scope of work and

00:57:54,730 --> 00:58:00,710
this a living scope of work is your

00:57:57,560 --> 00:58:05,390
insurance against go creep and the unmet

00:58:00,710 --> 00:58:08,240
client expectations the fo w is updated

00:58:05,390 --> 00:58:10,130
at the end of every sprint then that

00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:11,870
needs to be sure that engineering signs

00:58:10,130 --> 00:58:15,950
off on them and then they're sent to the

00:58:11,870 --> 00:58:18,620
time and you don't move into the next

00:58:15,950 --> 00:58:21,260
print until that's signed so your sprint

00:58:18,620 --> 00:58:23,930
have to actually allow for this document

00:58:21,260 --> 00:58:28,480
life cycle to happen along with change

00:58:23,930 --> 00:58:31,370
orders so you might end a sprint on on

00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:37,490
Friday and you might not start the next

00:58:31,370 --> 00:58:42,890
friends until Wednesday and so you have

00:58:37,490 --> 00:58:44,630
to work that into the cycle so I'm

00:58:42,890 --> 00:58:52,250
almost done but one of the things that I

00:58:44,630 --> 00:58:52,480
see is a ticketing problem so now we're

00:58:52,250 --> 00:58:54,070
going

00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:56,080
to talk about development and if you

00:58:54,070 --> 00:58:59,020
notice I'm almost completely out of time

00:58:56,080 --> 00:59:02,290
and look how long it took us to get to

00:58:59,020 --> 00:59:06,310
this part so most of you are familiar

00:59:02,290 --> 00:59:08,590
with the development cycle but before

00:59:06,310 --> 00:59:10,720
you begin development you've done

00:59:08,590 --> 00:59:13,480
discovery them the audit you've done

00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:15,850
architecture actually a good time to

00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:18,880
really assess if the project should not

00:59:15,850 --> 00:59:21,970
move forward if your team really hates

00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:24,400
this client or hates the project and

00:59:21,970 --> 00:59:27,310
they're not sure that they can deliver

00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:29,580
it's a really good time to bail it's a

00:59:27,310 --> 00:59:32,830
really good time to say to the client

00:59:29,580 --> 00:59:37,119
here are your dots let's put this out

00:59:32,830 --> 00:59:38,940
for an RSP and because we're we don't

00:59:37,119 --> 00:59:41,500
think that we can deliver a good product

00:59:38,940 --> 00:59:43,240
it's actually okay to say that and then

00:59:41,500 --> 00:59:45,310
if you have an upstream or downstream

00:59:43,240 --> 00:59:47,080
partner and you can recommend lots of

00:59:45,310 --> 00:59:49,300
other company this is there much better

00:59:47,080 --> 00:59:51,970
at this kind of development maybe it's

00:59:49,300 --> 00:59:55,960
because it's a giant integration with an

00:59:51,970 --> 00:59:58,900
Oracle database it's a good time to to

00:59:55,960 --> 01:00:01,060
do it and especially if they're guide

00:59:58,900 --> 01:00:03,970
clients if they're not coachable if they

01:00:01,060 --> 01:00:06,970
haven't paid on time you can see that

01:00:03,970 --> 01:00:10,859
there's some shaky vegetarian there's no

01:00:06,970 --> 01:00:10,859
reason you have to go into development

01:00:11,700 --> 01:00:21,460
so kick it I get a lot of pushback about

01:00:16,180 --> 01:00:25,180
this I'm not exactly sure why but if

01:00:21,460 --> 01:00:26,910
tickets aren't accurate a Drupal shop is

01:00:25,180 --> 01:00:29,619
running their business off valves data

01:00:26,910 --> 01:00:34,060
because everything rolls up from what's

01:00:29,619 --> 01:00:36,310
happening at the engineers desk and so

01:00:34,060 --> 01:00:37,960
if you don't have accurate ticket you

01:00:36,310 --> 01:00:40,900
don't really know if you've made money

01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:46,840
on the project and the reason for that

01:00:40,900 --> 01:00:49,270
is this is what I often see I'll open up

01:00:46,840 --> 01:00:51,160
JIRA and intensity I'll show me a ticket

01:00:49,270 --> 01:00:56,109
for the day and they mostly look like

01:00:51,160 --> 01:00:57,580
this there's a title and there's they

01:00:56,109 --> 01:01:01,900
tied it to a project and they've

01:00:57,580 --> 01:01:05,799
allocated some hour well what are you

01:01:01,900 --> 01:01:08,559
building of you can take 30 minutes

01:01:05,799 --> 01:01:10,719
you can take two days so that's an

01:01:08,559 --> 01:01:13,119
imaginary number so if we just look at

01:01:10,719 --> 01:01:16,179
some of the things of you have to have

01:01:13,119 --> 01:01:17,920
you have to know what content types you

01:01:16,179 --> 01:01:19,449
have to know what deals you have to know

01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:22,449
whether the labels are hidden you have

01:01:19,449 --> 01:01:24,699
to know what images we have to know if

01:01:22,449 --> 01:01:28,359
there's teasers or titles or articles

01:01:24,699 --> 01:01:30,279
goes on for a long time if you somehow

01:01:28,359 --> 01:01:34,179
are in Drupal and have never looked at

01:01:30,279 --> 01:01:36,489
the interface for views every option in

01:01:34,179 --> 01:01:39,189
that huge interface has to be on the

01:01:36,489 --> 01:01:43,089
ticket and I get engineer saying all the

01:01:39,189 --> 01:01:46,269
time well if I write all that stuff down

01:01:43,089 --> 01:01:48,999
I could have built the view which is

01:01:46,269 --> 01:01:50,890
sometimes true and then I always say

01:01:48,999 --> 01:01:53,160
well what happens if you're not in and

01:01:50,890 --> 01:01:55,479
somebody else has to build that view

01:01:53,160 --> 01:01:58,449
what happens when we have to build that

01:01:55,479 --> 01:02:01,329
view again what happens when we're

01:01:58,449 --> 01:02:03,849
asking someone to QA that view what are

01:02:01,329 --> 01:02:07,749
they queuing yep that was a view I

01:02:03,849 --> 01:02:10,630
thought like there's no there's no there

01:02:07,749 --> 01:02:13,479
there one thing that can help shortcut

01:02:10,630 --> 01:02:15,880
this is it as a company what you do is

01:02:13,479 --> 01:02:19,299
you build content types of view define

01:02:15,880 --> 01:02:22,119
what a view is in your company and then

01:02:19,299 --> 01:02:25,479
train everybody but then we can say

01:02:22,119 --> 01:02:28,329
build standard view but then we all know

01:02:25,479 --> 01:02:31,569
what that means so you can shortcut it I

01:02:28,329 --> 01:02:35,229
actually build snippets and so you can

01:02:31,569 --> 01:02:38,229
reuse them like a checklist but the goal

01:02:35,229 --> 01:02:41,109
is to just touch of you want what I find

01:02:38,229 --> 01:02:44,049
happens is that a view is built it goes

01:02:41,109 --> 01:02:46,119
to QA QA goes yep sets of you the client

01:02:44,049 --> 01:02:48,849
gets a ghost oh I needed to have an

01:02:46,119 --> 01:02:51,519
image it goes back to the engineer you

01:02:48,849 --> 01:02:54,369
put them in image go to QA yep there's

01:02:51,519 --> 01:02:56,380
an image and then the client says oh but

01:02:54,369 --> 01:02:58,599
I need that to be a smaller image and

01:02:56,380 --> 01:03:02,109
can make it square so it goes back to

01:02:58,599 --> 01:03:04,209
the engineer so now does that so it goes

01:03:02,109 --> 01:03:06,189
back and forth so that view that was

01:03:04,209 --> 01:03:09,699
supposed to take two hours takes two

01:03:06,189 --> 01:03:12,670
days and that's where a lot of the

01:03:09,699 --> 01:03:15,429
bleeding happens is that the tickets are

01:03:12,670 --> 01:03:17,829
poor and work gets done two and three

01:03:15,429 --> 01:03:19,480
and four times and you paid an engineer

01:03:17,829 --> 01:03:22,090
you paid the QA person

01:03:19,480 --> 01:03:24,640
exhausted your climate so very bad

01:03:22,090 --> 01:03:32,740
business methodologies to have people

01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:36,060
running around off of that tickets so

01:03:32,740 --> 01:03:41,109
now we've gotten all the way to here and

01:03:36,060 --> 01:03:43,090
it's sad to say goodbye but you are now

01:03:41,109 --> 01:03:44,710
going to go to Phase two and they're

01:03:43,090 --> 01:03:46,660
going to repeat all the steps it's very

01:03:44,710 --> 01:03:48,550
tempting to skip discovering

01:03:46,660 --> 01:03:51,160
architecture in Phase two and three and

01:03:48,550 --> 01:03:53,050
you don't have to do is as heavily but

01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:55,150
you do have to attend the documentation

01:03:53,050 --> 01:03:57,369
you do have to make sure you got your

01:03:55,150 --> 01:03:59,200
storyboards right and continue to

01:03:57,369 --> 01:04:03,640
upgrade the leave your dashboard

01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:05,859
wireframe following your process so we

01:04:03,640 --> 01:04:08,440
close the cap we've done if I doubt it

01:04:05,859 --> 01:04:11,080
was young training within discovery used

01:04:08,440 --> 01:04:13,240
on architecture we've done uhe and we

01:04:11,080 --> 01:04:15,940
have a user guide because we have a

01:04:13,240 --> 01:04:19,720
document all the way through the process

01:04:15,940 --> 01:04:23,230
our little slw has been with us every

01:04:19,720 --> 01:04:25,270
step of the way and then for you you've

01:04:23,230 --> 01:04:28,869
managed your client expectations you've

01:04:25,270 --> 01:04:33,910
delivered it win with an MVP you know

01:04:28,869 --> 01:04:35,500
about technical debt and you've now

01:04:33,910 --> 01:04:38,710
delivered a fabulous projects and made

01:04:35,500 --> 01:04:41,950
money so i will stay around for as long

01:04:38,710 --> 01:04:44,140
as people want to ask questions so i

01:04:41,950 --> 01:04:47,740
hope you got a lot of value out of this

01:04:44,140 --> 01:04:50,080
and i'd like to thank the drupal

01:04:47,740 --> 01:04:51,790
association for all of their help and

01:04:50,080 --> 01:04:55,119
support and the opportunity to speak

01:04:51,790 --> 01:04:58,440
with you today thank you thanks so much

01:04:55,119 --> 01:05:02,109
Susan got a really lot of good feedback

01:04:58,440 --> 01:05:04,630
we do have one question from earlier I

01:05:02,109 --> 01:05:07,240
didn't want to interrupt you excuse me

01:05:04,630 --> 01:05:09,640
um how much you put into winning a pitch

01:05:07,240 --> 01:05:13,690
do you have a percentage of the budget

01:05:09,640 --> 01:05:14,950
eat that you like to use say a budget is

01:05:13,690 --> 01:05:16,780
a hundred thousand dollars and you want

01:05:14,950 --> 01:05:19,119
to put ten percent into winning projects

01:05:16,780 --> 01:05:21,280
you really want therefore you put in the

01:05:19,119 --> 01:05:25,710
equivalent of 10,000 to get that project

01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:28,900
I know those are such difficult

01:05:25,710 --> 01:05:32,710
questions aren't they business business

01:05:28,900 --> 01:05:35,500
questions but what I'd like to do is

01:05:32,710 --> 01:05:38,200
a bit like that that what you're doing

01:05:35,500 --> 01:05:40,359
is discovering architecture so you are

01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:43,810
putting that nbafan at risk but rather

01:05:40,359 --> 01:05:47,320
than it just being a pitch what would be

01:05:43,810 --> 01:05:52,710
really nice if what you delivered was

01:05:47,320 --> 01:05:55,420
actually discovery so that when you win

01:05:52,710 --> 01:05:58,060
which if you do awesome discovery you

01:05:55,420 --> 01:06:01,060
will because what you're showing them is

01:05:58,060 --> 01:06:02,890
all of the information that needs to be

01:06:01,060 --> 01:06:07,720
in consideration so it shows your

01:06:02,890 --> 01:06:10,089
expertise that when you do that you now

01:06:07,720 --> 01:06:13,390
have your discovery documents and so you

01:06:10,089 --> 01:06:16,420
bought they just preload each with

01:06:13,390 --> 01:06:19,089
pre-loaded that work so the closer you

01:06:16,420 --> 01:06:22,570
can get to ending up with discovery

01:06:19,089 --> 01:06:26,230
docks with this with the storyboards

01:06:22,570 --> 01:06:28,420
concept then the less wasted effort and

01:06:26,230 --> 01:06:29,980
money it is and especially with

01:06:28,420 --> 01:06:32,970
storyboards if you remember that's the

01:06:29,980 --> 01:06:36,400
one with the icon and that goes together

01:06:32,970 --> 01:06:38,410
blazingly fast I usually have someone

01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:42,339
that's more in the design gaming tried

01:06:38,410 --> 01:06:44,500
do it I use omnigraffle and just because

01:06:42,339 --> 01:06:45,880
they're more facile with the tool over

01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:47,640
there than the engineers and they

01:06:45,880 --> 01:06:50,530
actually care that it looks pretty um

01:06:47,640 --> 01:06:53,200
don't you go together amazing this app

01:06:50,530 --> 01:06:55,660
and if you can get your storyboards in

01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:58,650
there along with everything else you're

01:06:55,660 --> 01:07:01,420
a little right into that process

01:06:58,650 --> 01:07:04,780
great we actually had a lot of requests

01:07:01,420 --> 01:07:06,220
for your templates so I let people know

01:07:04,780 --> 01:07:08,470
that they could probably contact you

01:07:06,220 --> 01:07:11,530
separately and you could discuss that

01:07:08,470 --> 01:07:13,420
further yeah I don't have them on my

01:07:11,530 --> 01:07:17,230
website that I put up yesterday and I

01:07:13,420 --> 01:07:22,180
hope it up today gotta what of the raid

01:07:17,230 --> 01:07:23,859
project I know never heard of it I've

01:07:22,180 --> 01:07:26,380
done this consulting and I've never

01:07:23,859 --> 01:07:30,940
needed a website people use my LinkedIn

01:07:26,380 --> 01:07:33,339
page but but you can email me at Susan a

01:07:30,940 --> 01:07:36,400
triple anyway calm and then once I have

01:07:33,339 --> 01:07:39,730
them up I do have slides up on

01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:41,859
SlideShare you can google that and then

01:07:39,730 --> 01:07:44,800
I'll put I think this will be available

01:07:41,859 --> 01:07:45,900
to so but yes I will definitely share my

01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:49,680
template

01:07:45,900 --> 01:07:53,220
the one spreadsheet actually is one i

01:07:49,680 --> 01:07:55,589
modified from palantir and I'm assuming

01:07:53,220 --> 01:07:57,569
that they meant to share that because I

01:07:55,589 --> 01:08:00,690
I got that from someone who said they

01:07:57,569 --> 01:08:05,390
got it from a palantir workshop and then

01:08:00,690 --> 01:08:09,059
the other one is one that I put together

01:08:05,390 --> 01:08:11,789
for when I when I do business consulting

01:08:09,059 --> 01:08:14,309
with triple shock so kind of great to

01:08:11,789 --> 01:08:18,600
share that one great a couple more

01:08:14,309 --> 01:08:21,029
questions can you give a description

01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:25,440
again of s 0 w and what that stands for

01:08:21,029 --> 01:08:28,440
oh I am so sorry so f 0 W is scope of

01:08:25,440 --> 01:08:30,540
work and the way that I think of it is

01:08:28,440 --> 01:08:32,909
that Dee's our engineering doc that's

01:08:30,540 --> 01:08:35,670
what we that's those are the documents

01:08:32,909 --> 01:08:40,109
that we look at in the beginning so

01:08:35,670 --> 01:08:41,759
scope of work is a compilation of those

01:08:40,109 --> 01:08:44,670
engineering docs you know like the

01:08:41,759 --> 01:08:47,310
palantir and that omnigraffle document

01:08:44,670 --> 01:08:50,219
and the storyboard so when you combine

01:08:47,310 --> 01:08:51,929
all of those elements together with the

01:08:50,219 --> 01:08:54,509
user dashboards and why your veins

01:08:51,929 --> 01:08:58,380
that's the scope of work it's what is

01:08:54,509 --> 01:09:02,609
the legally binding part of its the

01:08:58,380 --> 01:09:05,580
contract for work cool we have another

01:09:02,609 --> 01:09:07,560
really fantastic question presumably you

01:09:05,580 --> 01:09:10,170
charge for discovery and architecture

01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:12,239
how do you estimate or quote for it

01:09:10,170 --> 01:09:14,400
especially since it's the most valuable

01:09:12,239 --> 01:09:18,120
bit of work and it's often very unknown

01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:20,040
how much time will go into it yeah so

01:09:18,120 --> 01:09:22,969
when you look through this presentation

01:09:20,040 --> 01:09:25,529
again I do have a slide that shows

01:09:22,969 --> 01:09:30,449
percentages of how to allocate your

01:09:25,529 --> 01:09:32,460
$100,000 project and so what I can do

01:09:30,449 --> 01:09:34,380
let me pull that up on my screen again

01:09:32,460 --> 01:09:36,509
Lauren and we can look at that because

01:09:34,380 --> 01:09:38,219
that is a good question yeah let me

01:09:36,509 --> 01:09:42,150
switch a screen share really quickly

01:09:38,219 --> 01:09:46,890
yeah so in the beginning you'll be very

01:09:42,150 --> 01:09:49,920
hesitant and tentative to like ask for

01:09:46,890 --> 01:09:51,600
the money because it's sometimes a new

01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:53,549
way and I was definitely train your

01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:55,469
salespeople but what I love about

01:09:53,549 --> 01:09:59,340
selling it on earth is that it's a

01:09:55,469 --> 01:10:01,590
really small bite and people are like

01:09:59,340 --> 01:10:04,739
okay I'll do that like it's a very

01:10:01,590 --> 01:10:08,219
low-risk engagement and so you know you

01:10:04,739 --> 01:10:10,170
might you might lose money on the line

01:10:08,219 --> 01:10:12,630
item called discovery but you are losing

01:10:10,170 --> 01:10:25,260
money on the line item called discovery

01:10:12,630 --> 01:10:27,780
anyway so just the fact that there can

01:10:25,260 --> 01:10:29,639
everybody did that come up yet yeah it's

01:10:27,780 --> 01:10:37,199
a little bit of a delay but it'll it'll

01:10:29,639 --> 01:10:40,320
be there so if you look at the slide it

01:10:37,199 --> 01:10:42,659
can be a little more or less you can

01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:45,150
figure out like what is comfortable for

01:10:42,659 --> 01:10:48,510
you but I would train your sales people

01:10:45,150 --> 01:10:50,369
to sell off these little engagement you

01:10:48,510 --> 01:10:53,429
can sell off an audit you can sell off

01:10:50,369 --> 01:10:56,880
discovery you can sell architecture you

01:10:53,429 --> 01:11:00,570
can actually sell design right like you

01:10:56,880 --> 01:11:06,480
don't have to do that totally tied to

01:11:00,570 --> 01:11:11,670
development hmm yeah it's not I'll it's

01:11:06,480 --> 01:11:13,260
fine I'm sure he can I you yeah I can

01:11:11,670 --> 01:11:15,360
publish this flight separately if we

01:11:13,260 --> 01:11:18,119
need to but it was five percent audit

01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:20,760
ten percent discovery ten percent

01:11:18,119 --> 01:11:23,570
architecture thirty percent development

01:11:20,760 --> 01:11:28,080
thirty percent design and thirty percent

01:11:23,570 --> 01:11:32,099
may chief or kk % ua p so you work out

01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:35,820
like what's good for you and and then

01:11:32,099 --> 01:11:39,389
you'll be able to just start filming

01:11:35,820 --> 01:11:41,460
that okay okay last question if the

01:11:39,389 --> 01:11:43,770
client won't or can't sign up for an

01:11:41,460 --> 01:11:45,719
agile process what do you do do you say

01:11:43,770 --> 01:11:48,719
no to the project or do you run with it

01:11:45,719 --> 01:11:52,820
more like a waterfall or run an agile

01:11:48,719 --> 01:11:58,860
internally but not with the client so

01:11:52,820 --> 01:12:01,860
after was tricky oh I see a lot of

01:11:58,860 --> 01:12:05,869
people say they're working agile and

01:12:01,860 --> 01:12:08,580
what they mean is common material

01:12:05,869 --> 01:12:10,650
because delivering agile is a very

01:12:08,580 --> 01:12:12,420
specific thing and I I don't take too

01:12:10,650 --> 01:12:13,080
many companies that actually deliver

01:12:12,420 --> 01:12:16,680
agile

01:12:13,080 --> 01:12:20,070
so what they often mean is I work time

01:12:16,680 --> 01:12:22,350
and materials because as well means

01:12:20,070 --> 01:12:24,390
you're actually developing deliverable

01:12:22,350 --> 01:12:28,560
products all along the way and that's a

01:12:24,390 --> 01:12:30,810
I think some pretty deep talent to do

01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:33,660
that what I see is people taking a

01:12:30,810 --> 01:12:38,190
waterfall project working on at time and

01:12:33,660 --> 01:12:40,620
materials internally like that so I just

01:12:38,190 --> 01:12:42,390
think it's that important for you I

01:12:40,620 --> 01:12:44,370
think it's important for you to work the

01:12:42,390 --> 01:12:47,460
way that you're comfortable doing I

01:12:44,370 --> 01:12:49,020
think it's more important to look and

01:12:47,460 --> 01:12:51,480
see if you're making money doing it that

01:12:49,020 --> 01:12:53,700
way like it doesn't matter what you do

01:12:51,480 --> 01:12:55,920
like you can do waterfall and actually

01:12:53,700 --> 01:12:57,660
if you do waterfall correctly you can

01:12:55,920 --> 01:13:01,020
get to value-based pricing really

01:12:57,660 --> 01:13:04,920
quickly so it took you a hundred hours

01:13:01,020 --> 01:13:06,900
to build the project but you're sold it

01:13:04,920 --> 01:13:09,720
for three hundred percent of what you

01:13:06,900 --> 01:13:18,210
actually did so waterfall can be very

01:13:09,720 --> 01:13:20,250
successful um so so if that's helpful

01:13:18,210 --> 01:13:23,160
the other thing that I see is that

01:13:20,250 --> 01:13:26,130
people fell waterfall which means I've

01:13:23,160 --> 01:13:27,990
agreed to do this project for twenty

01:13:26,130 --> 01:13:33,170
thousand dollars but then they show the

01:13:27,990 --> 01:13:33,170
client their hours and then some have a

01:13:33,590 --> 01:13:40,380
bill like they're agile so if you feel

01:13:38,310 --> 01:13:43,200
waterfall you don't have to show tiny

01:13:40,380 --> 01:13:46,320
materials they've agreed to this project

01:13:43,200 --> 01:13:48,450
at this prior you're done internally you

01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:50,580
should track hours so that you know that

01:13:48,450 --> 01:13:52,650
you made money but the client doesn't

01:13:50,580 --> 01:13:54,570
get to have the best of both worlds you

01:13:52,650 --> 01:13:57,000
don't get to do a waterfall project and

01:13:54,570 --> 01:13:59,100
then pay you on time materials so be

01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:04,190
sure that whatever methodology your

01:13:59,100 --> 01:14:07,740
viewing it's the correct way to do it

01:14:04,190 --> 01:14:09,990
awesome thanks so much Susan just a

01:14:07,740 --> 01:14:11,940
reminder thanks everyone for joining us

01:14:09,990 --> 01:14:13,980
this was really informative we got a lot

01:14:11,940 --> 01:14:15,750
of positive feedback and of course we

01:14:13,980 --> 01:14:18,270
really appreciate you participating and

01:14:15,750 --> 01:14:20,250
asking questions and for Susan for

01:14:18,270 --> 01:14:23,160
joining us and you know helping out with

01:14:20,250 --> 01:14:25,410
the drupal association webcast series so

01:14:23,160 --> 01:14:26,340
just a reminder to take the survey at

01:14:25,410 --> 01:14:28,860
the end of this webcam

01:14:26,340 --> 01:14:30,710
it really helps with our content

01:14:28,860 --> 01:14:32,820
selection and then of course you know

01:14:30,710 --> 01:14:35,400
improving the sessions that we can

01:14:32,820 --> 01:14:37,469
provide for you a lot of people asked if

01:14:35,400 --> 01:14:39,900
there's going to be a recording and if

01:14:37,469 --> 01:14:43,159
