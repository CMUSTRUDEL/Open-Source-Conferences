are all going to be able to ask

00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:58,500
questions today as Brad powers speaks

00:00:55,739 --> 00:01:01,350
about his experience of selecting a CMS

00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:04,199

00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:06,330
and if you have a question please use

00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:09,000
the question section of your control

00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:10,950
panel rather than the chat section will

00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,200
be monitoring that question section and

00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:16,470
Brett will be Brad will be answering

00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:19,110
questions as he goes and also if you're

00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:21,150
listening from the computer versus

00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:22,799
calling in if you're having any issues

00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:25,439
hearing make sure you're wearing a

00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:27,540
headset and in the audio section of the

00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:30,420
control panel select the mic and speaker

00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:34,500
option and then after this presentation

00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:36,030
you will see a webinar survey appear and

00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:38,610
we just asked if you'll give us feedback

00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:39,840
because we want to the webinar program

00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:42,470
is relatively new for the drupal

00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,939
association and we want to make sure

00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:46,680
that we hear from you what kind of

00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:48,659
content you want to hear next and we'll

00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:51,990
start lining those those up in our

00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:53,850
series but before we get started before

00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:56,189
I hand this over to Brad let me just

00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:58,380
could be a quick hi view of the drupal

00:01:56,189 --> 00:02:00,270
association I can see the attendee list

00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:01,560
my I see lots of names of people that

00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:03,030
are really involved with a drupal

00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:05,729
association but i also see some new

00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:08,250
people so i wanted just to give everyone

00:02:05,729 --> 00:02:10,819
a quick overview so the drupal

00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:14,069
association is based in portland oregon

00:02:10,819 --> 00:02:16,290
but we serve the whole global community

00:02:14,069 --> 00:02:18,810
and we actually have staff and all all

00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:21,749
sorts of places and not obviously

00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:24,239
Portland but our mission is to foster

00:02:21,749 --> 00:02:26,010
and support the Drupal community so

00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:28,950
basically we take care of all the

00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:31,230
maintenance of things and helping to

00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:33,389
educate youth just so you can have a

00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:35,819
growing community that's contributing to

00:02:33,389 --> 00:02:37,889
the project and just freeing you up to

00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:39,719
do what you do best which is you know

00:02:37,889 --> 00:02:41,909
connecting collaborating on the code

00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:43,769
accelerating the project and also

00:02:41,909 --> 00:02:45,060
getting together and having a fun time

00:02:43,769 --> 00:02:47,790
don't know is a big part of our

00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:50,250
communities and so we get funds from

00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:51,930
lots of different ways whether it's from

00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:54,389
our Drupal cons or international

00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:58,319
conferences or our membership programs

00:02:54,389 --> 00:03:00,780
or the supporting partner program which

00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:04,500
I can talk about at the end of today's

00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:05,669
presentation and o we have hosting

00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:08,430
partners and all these different

00:03:05,669 --> 00:03:10,709
programs generate revenue that we use to

00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:13,549
fund community programs so one of our

00:03:10,709 --> 00:03:16,590
biggest focus is right now is hiring a

00:03:13,549 --> 00:03:18,750
drupal.org technical team that will

00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:21,389
provide the improvements that we all

00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:22,949
need so that the site serves all the

00:03:21,389 --> 00:03:25,079
different personas it's really easy to

00:03:22,949 --> 00:03:27,239
navigate and find information where you

00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:29,400
can learn about Drupal and be able to

00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:33,030
get the life cycles that you're adopting

00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:34,560
and then contributing back and so we you

00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:38,669
know we have a lot of work happening on

00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:41,549
that front already and then for the

00:03:38,669 --> 00:03:43,079
hosting services we pay for that as well

00:03:41,549 --> 00:03:45,720
as the hardware for the infrastructure

00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:48,569
and we host our Drupal cons or

00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:51,239
international events we have some coming

00:03:48,569 --> 00:03:54,299
we have drupalcon Prague coming up at

00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:57,840
the end of this month and and then we

00:03:54,299 --> 00:04:00,150
also have grants that anyone can apply

00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,310
for if you have a way to further the

00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:05,099
project and grow the community whether

00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:07,579
it's starting a new camp or you want to

00:04:05,099 --> 00:04:12,569
do a road show with a couple companies

00:04:07,579 --> 00:04:15,449
to evangelize Drupal to decision makers

00:04:12,569 --> 00:04:18,120
we have money available for you to apply

00:04:15,449 --> 00:04:20,759
to and you just go to association

00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:22,229
drupal.org / grants tells you how to

00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:25,020
apply and we still have money available

00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:26,849
this year so definitely look into that

00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:27,930
opportunity or contact me and I can tell

00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:30,509
you more

00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:34,470
the other program that we have is called

00:04:30,509 --> 00:04:37,199
global training days and around the

00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:40,410
world we organize trainers to provide a

00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:44,550
free or near free training on the same

00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:45,780
day and it's it's a way to grow the

00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:47,850
developer base in your local community

00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:49,530
but if you're a training company it's a

00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:52,039
great loss leader because once you give

00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:54,780
them say the hello Drupal type of

00:04:52,039 --> 00:04:57,990
training then you can upsell them for

00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:59,340
your three or five day training so if

00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:02,250
you would like to get information about

00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:06,780
that please contact me as well the next

00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:08,430
one will be in November so as I

00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:10,680

talk about your business challenges and

00:05:27,509 --> 00:05:34,320

mentioned we had a chance to connect it

00:07:59,069 --> 00:08:03,029
calm portlyn which was my first one so

00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:06,029
it was really enjoyable to get exposure

00:08:03,029 --> 00:08:07,979
to the vibrant community in a lot of

00:08:06,029 --> 00:08:09,719
time trying to figure out ways that I

00:08:07,979 --> 00:08:11,729
could contribute in whole foods could

00:08:09,719 --> 00:08:13,259
contribute obviously us setting up a

00:08:11,729 --> 00:08:15,839
boost that drupalcon didn't make the

00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:17,789
most sense so this is one of the ways

00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:18,749
that I hope you find it useful and look

00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:20,339
forward to getting feedback in the

00:08:18,749 --> 00:08:22,649
survey about either other topics that

00:08:20,339 --> 00:08:25,019
you'd want or maybe other people from my

00:08:22,649 --> 00:08:26,429
organization you'd like to hear from we

00:08:25,019 --> 00:08:27,839

00:08:26,429 --> 00:08:31,649
somebody more on the marketing side come

00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:33,209

00:08:37,349 --> 00:08:41,519
with whole foods market I leave the tech

00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:45,720
teams here that support multiple

00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:47,430
websites not all Drupal we have some old

00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:49,920
hand coded stuff some wordpress stuff

00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:52,470
our guest facing whole foods market com

00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:54,020

00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:57,360
online commerce

00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:59,400
and we made the decision probably about

00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,320
a year and a half ago to to go with

00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:03,510

recently and in kind of as i mentioned

00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:10,890
i'm really excited to try to figure out

00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:12,510
new ways or ways i can bring my

00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:15,120
experience and skill set which is not

00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:18,600

00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:39,330
what we were thinking and a few

00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:41,100
different slides and then also towards

00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:42,960
the end just some lessons learned that I

00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:44,850
hope might be valuable for all of you

00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:47,850
when you're working with your clients

00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:49,529
and partners things that I've thought a

00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:51,330
lot about and would probably be do

00:09:49,529 --> 00:09:53,730
differently or kind of what I'll expose

00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:56,130
to you more towards the end so kind of

00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:57,750
what we were thinking as many of you who

00:09:56,130 --> 00:10:00,750
follow technology probably realized

00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:06,120
there are several large alcohol and paid

00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:10,170
players that that seem in my opinion to

00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:11,910
be adopting customers as much as they're

00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:14,010
adopting and acquiring new technologies

00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:15,630
and so one of the things that we wanted

00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:18,240
to do was look at what are our

00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:20,490
year-over-year costs and not just think

00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,140
about the cost that we pay in terms of

00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:26,279
maintenance and enterprise agreements

00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:27,810
but also the cost that we pay by getting

00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:31,650
deeper and deeper with with a given

00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:33,630
vendor so as we as we've seen the shift

00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:36,270
one one of the I guess problems or

00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:38,850
concerns that we're seeing is you know

00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:41,070
large vendor X not to use other people's

00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:44,300
names and customs but larger vendor X if

00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:48,089
they own you on your team member

00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:49,830
peoplesoft HR side and then they go out

00:10:48,089 --> 00:10:51,570
and acquire whoever it is that you use

00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:54,570
for your front end creative content and

00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:57,270
whoever protect perhaps used to for your

00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:58,500
CMS if you have less and less ability to

00:10:57,270 --> 00:11:00,110
really negotiate because they know

00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:04,170
they've got you deeper and deeper into

00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:07,650
their overall portfolio and even when

00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:08,910
you have longer term contracts set like

00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:11,370
we have some enterprise agreements with

00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:13,470
several of the larger players you get

00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:15,930
the perception from from a short-term

00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:18,209
cost benefit that that this is a much

00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:20,190
better deal but you've just invested

00:11:18,209 --> 00:11:22,440
yourself in into this technology for

00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:24,180
three years and over the course of the

00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:26,520
three years they're banking that you're

00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:28,529
going to get more and more users and

00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:30,600
have more and more software and be more

00:11:28,529 --> 00:11:32,339
and more invested and then if they

00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:34,950
acquire a couple of other companies over

00:11:32,339 --> 00:11:36,630
that three-year span then again it's

00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:38,070
harder and harder to to negotiate

00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:39,750
because they want to bundle more and

00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:41,790
more together to give you the lower

00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:43,680
price which again makes it harder and

00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:45,060
harder to get out so hopefully that

00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,980
makes sense to everybody that was one of

00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:50,630
the big cost

00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:54,300
part of the equation that we factored in

00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:56,220
another big one and just going to a an

00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:57,839
open source platform and we were seeing

00:11:56,220 --> 00:12:00,269
this evenin and you all probably are as

00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:01,920
well even in paid products is the whole

00:12:00,269 --> 00:12:06,000
idea of being able to get indemnity and

00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:08,130
how indemnity works and how trolls are

00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,510
becoming a real problem and so one of

00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:10,709
the things that we looked a lot at and

00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:12,600
moving to open source because that was

00:12:10,709 --> 00:12:14,459
that was new for us is well how do we

00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:18,959
protect ourselves and what things do we

00:12:14,459 --> 00:12:20,339
need to consider in terms of cost and so

00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:21,959
those would be things to make sure that

00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:24,899
your partners and clients are thinking

00:12:21,959 --> 00:12:27,060
about we did find a year so go a few

00:12:24,899 --> 00:12:30,029
firms that do offer some kind of

00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:32,550
insurance assurances I don't frankly

00:12:30,029 --> 00:12:34,709
know how credible they are we didn't dig

00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:36,300
very deep into it a couple of things

00:12:34,709 --> 00:12:38,160
that we looked at doing is making sure

00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:40,589
our legal team was was heavily involved

00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:41,970
in those conversations and that we're

00:12:40,589 --> 00:12:45,240
really doing some kind of risk reward

00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:49,170
analysis and saying okay so in theory

00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:50,339
this is free your software we can't just

00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:51,779
take all that money and go put it

00:12:50,339 --> 00:12:54,990
someplace else we have to reserve some

00:12:51,779 --> 00:12:57,089
of that money a to protect ourselves in

00:12:54,990 --> 00:13:00,149
case we do have some sort of patent

00:12:57,089 --> 00:13:01,319
infringement that pops up be we need to

00:13:00,149 --> 00:13:03,199
invest some of that money back into the

00:13:01,319 --> 00:13:05,459
community to make sure it's healthy and

00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:08,370
so making sure that you're setting some

00:13:05,459 --> 00:13:09,569
kind of dollars aside or advising your

00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:11,639
clients that's that some kind of dollars

00:13:09,569 --> 00:13:14,310
aside for any risk that might come up is

00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:16,019
important another thing that we've been

00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:19,170
able to do also is work with any

00:13:16,019 --> 00:13:21,690
partners that help us either build a

00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:23,430
module or Rico to module that they carry

00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:26,010
some of that indemnity basically saying

00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:29,970
you know will stand up in court with you

00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:31,680
if module why somebody comes and claims

00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:33,029
that there's code in there that they

00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:36,120
wrote and they own it they own a patent

00:13:33,029 --> 00:13:38,579
on it so it also helps leverage that

00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:40,949
risk across multiple providers because

00:13:38,579 --> 00:13:42,540
then if they're coming after your

00:13:40,949 --> 00:13:45,029
clients company for the money some of

00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:47,160
that risk is deferred to a smaller

00:13:45,029 --> 00:13:48,449
company it's not so appealing to take

00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:50,310
the smaller company with the smaller

00:13:48,449 --> 00:13:54,540
pockets to court so the couple of ideas

00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:55,860
on and ending to their and as Megan said

00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:57,540
anytime questions come up please feel

00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:59,760
free I'm trying to keep one eye on that

00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:00,990
and when I on the deck so let me know

00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,580
and we can entertain them

00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:05,010
or we can do them off in whatever is

00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:06,750
good for everybody so what else were you

00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:08,790
thinking obviously there's cost and you

00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:10,950
know there's long-term assurances that

00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:12,870
you need and the other part is just how

00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:16,290
does the content you know how easy is it

00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:18,240
what what can you do with it so one of

00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:19,980
the things that we were frankly a little

00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,690
trapped with as the technology team is

00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:24,450
being kind of a bottleneck for our

00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:25,770
content team and in working with a few

00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:27,839
other partners and having a chance to

00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:31,290
talk to other users on the technology

00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:33,420
side at a Drupal con this was a theme

00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:35,550
that I heard with all of them whatever

00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:38,430
CMS like or homegrown system they were

00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:39,600
using came to the bottleneck with the

00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:42,930
technology team when it was time to

00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,860
deploy or push changes out so we were

00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:45,450
definitely looking for something that

00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:47,459
gave some more creativity and

00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:49,230
flexibility to our to our content team

00:14:47,459 --> 00:14:51,899
to to be able to publish content on

00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:53,850
their own and as I mentioned it frees

00:14:51,899 --> 00:14:57,290
them to do that work at the pace that

00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:59,820
the marketing team needs it to do and

00:14:57,290 --> 00:15:02,040
allows a site to be you know richer and

00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:03,600
more dynamic and more responsive to any

00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:08,570
kind of current trends or news or

00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:10,560
whatever is going on in the no www there

00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:11,910
the other thing is obviously important

00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,380
is how engaging in how rich of an

00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:15,930
experience is this for our guest is

00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:18,450
because for us is if you all look at our

00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:20,940
site it's it's it's an information site

00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:22,709
it's an engagement side it's it's a way

00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:24,810
we want to create affinity and loyalty

00:15:22,709 --> 00:15:27,420
that aren't purchase based in our

00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:29,329
discount or coupon based about us being

00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:31,740
able to build a rich experience that

00:15:29,329 --> 00:15:34,260
hopefully gets closer and closer to

00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:35,760
mimicking what it's like in our store

00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:38,579
experience in terms of knowing who you

00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:42,000
are and being able to connect important

00:15:38,579 --> 00:15:43,290
articles or lifestyle preferences based

00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,450
upon either the behavior that you

00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:48,660
exhibit or the information you you give

00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:51,500
about yourself so for us this is this is

00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:54,870
a key area that drove Drupal to the top

00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:57,570
we really felt it that it would allow us

00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:59,339
to provide a richer social and you know

00:15:57,570 --> 00:16:01,380
more engaging an integrated experience

00:15:59,339 --> 00:16:02,760
for the guests you know I think the

00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:06,360
marketing team in particular was

00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:08,370
attracted by I said a high level with

00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:09,990
what they said was what they felt like

00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:14,339
was a product that started with social

00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:14,990
and learned to do content versus a few

00:16:14,339 --> 00:16:17,360
others that are

00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:18,880
content-based initially and are now

00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:22,040
trying to learn how to be more social

00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:23,300
and then kind of last point there is

00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:25,790
reiterating what I said already they

00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:29,470
really felt like it was the tool that

00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:33,290
was going to allow them to have a very

00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:35,240
focused customized the an engaged

00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:38,270
experience with with an individual user

00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:39,880
and we taken a few steps towards that we

00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:42,380
know we know we have a long way to go

00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:44,600
but we've already built in functionality

00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:47,200
that recognizes you know you as a user

00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:50,120
this is your store these are events or

00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:51,589
venues in the store or that are specific

00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:58,399
to your store and the experience that

00:16:51,589 --> 00:17:00,500
you want next slide please the other

00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:02,240
thing that's always attracting is is

00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:05,150
being able to do kind of what you want

00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:06,470
when you need to do it you know other

00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:08,780
partners that we work with in other

00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:11,329
areas of Technology it's difficult to

00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:15,410
get the priorities that you have on

00:17:11,329 --> 00:17:18,260
their roadmap sometimes it's even harder

00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:19,880
to get them to deliver what they say is

00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:23,000
on their roadmap when they say it should

00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:26,390
be delivered on their roadmap and so we

00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:28,700
wanted to be in more of a control than

00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:31,309
driving I mean we really see this as an

00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:33,559
opportunity to to push Drupal in and

00:17:31,309 --> 00:17:34,850
support the community with initiatives

00:17:33,559 --> 00:17:36,460
that are important to our business that

00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:39,620
we think will resonate with others and

00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:41,330
so we really appreciated the ability to

00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:42,830
to work and collaborate with the

00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:48,110
community and give back to the community

00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:49,760
to to drive this richer engagement and

00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:51,830
we just struggled to do that with many

00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:53,270
of our other technical partners due to

00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:56,090
either they're very long development

00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:58,280
cycles or the craziness that you have to

00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:59,960
get on some executive board to be a part

00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:02,090
of some decision-making group to craft

00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:03,740
what's going to happen or kind of the

00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:05,360
worst case you get what they give you

00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:08,559
and then you have to force your business

00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:11,240
to work around whatever you're given

00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:14,120
another it's important to us and it's

00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:15,590
not last or not the bottom because it's

00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:18,020
the least important it's less because I

00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:20,360
want to you know really hammer on this

00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:22,850
one we have a set of core values to

00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:25,100
drive our decision making and that's

00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:26,960
true in technology just like it isn't

00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:28,340
product but one of the things as

00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,850
technologists that we're excited about

00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:31,940
is

00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:34,940
it's it's easy and it's closer to who we

00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:36,830
are as a grocery retailer to think about

00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:39,410
creating a win-win relationship or a

00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:42,350
product vendor you know if somebody

00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:44,480
brings or we find this great artisanal

00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:46,130
product it's much easier to think about

00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:48,080
creating win-win relationships for them

00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:51,140
in terms of being able to invest in them

00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:53,990
and help them grow and help them attract

00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:56,000
more more jobs and grow their business

00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:57,710
and grow their product line to expand in

00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,180
multiple regions it's a little harder to

00:18:57,710 --> 00:19:01,570
think about that and how we can

00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:03,950
contribute that on the technology side

00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:06,980
but this is one area where we felt like

00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:08,480
we really could we could get invested in

00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:10,190
a community and give back to a

00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,470
technology that not only helps us grow

00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:14,630
but we think can help a lot of other

00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:17,360
businesses grow I mean we already know

00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:18,560
about the thousands of nonprofit sites

00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:21,290
around the world that are able to

00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:23,360
leverage the modules that the community

00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:25,160
delivers in and we feel like this is a

00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:28,180
way on the technology side that we can

00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:30,770
stay true true to those values which are

00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:33,940
really a lot harder for us to get our

00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:33,940
heads around in the technology space

00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:39,920
next one this will be kind of some meat

00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:41,240
for all of you around kind of yeah Oh

00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:43,730
Brad I was gonna say there are some

00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:44,960
questions about this last slide speaker

00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:47,390
though I'm not trying to pop up I'm

00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:50,510
sorry uh if you don't see them I can

00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:54,080
read them out to you yeah sure great so

00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:55,340
um the first one was about is it this is

00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:57,530
kind of like back towards the beginning

00:19:55,340 --> 00:20:00,590
of your slides you know that question

00:19:57,530 --> 00:20:02,450
was about is it really good and does it

00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:04,070
help him selling to talk about risks I

00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:06,260
guess there's questions about like

00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:10,550
patent trolls and and you have to deal

00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:11,780
with anything like risks in relation to

00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:15,110
patent trolls is pretty much the

00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:18,560
question yeah definitely I mean I think

00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:21,020
they're there is a risk there and we are

00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:24,740
experiencing that also on kind of the

00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:26,450
pseudo freeware side thinking about you

00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:27,770
know what would you've seen with red hat

00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:29,300
and a couple of other products like that

00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:31,070
where the community is created them but

00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:34,430
then they've kind of been packetized for

00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:36,050
commercial use so those have been real

00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:38,750
risk for us there so as we kind of went

00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:41,150
into our first big you know open-source

00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:42,690
adventure we we spent a lot of time with

00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:44,910
our leadership and our executive team

00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:46,650
I'm trying to understand what we were

00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:49,200
exposing ourselves to and making sure

00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:51,840
that we protected ourselves so I would

00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,950
say the size of your client the larger

00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:55,260
your client probably the more relevant

00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:57,900
it's going to be because then they'll at

00:20:55,260 --> 00:21:00,330
least in our experience the trolls

00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:02,820
realize what the pocket you know that

00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:05,130
the netspend of that company is and so

00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:07,710
it's much easier to go to a you know a

00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:09,420
billion-dollar your company and say pay

00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:10,620
us $100,000 right now we'll settle out

00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:12,600
of court than it is a company that's

00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:14,730
only making 150 thousand dollars a year

00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:19,380
so the bigger the company I think the

00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:21,390
more you're exposed because the greater

00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:24,000
visibility you have in the more likely

00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:28,170
they they believe you will be to settle

00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,220
out of court I think it's an important

00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:30,660
point to consider with any of your

00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:32,520
larger clients that they are protecting

00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:33,870
themselves or really what you're doing

00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:36,690
in this space is you're just setting

00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:41,040
aside money to to fight them if that's

00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:43,080
your choice that's great thanks for that

00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:45,150
I also I just give you a king visibility

00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:48,480
to the questions but sure okay then this

00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:51,260
one is it's really good it helps know

00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:53,700
something talk about pentose yeah um i

00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:55,860
don't i see the other part of its

00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:57,300
oxidized does it help in selling I think

00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:59,520
it's part of being a good partner right

00:21:57,300 --> 00:22:01,320
is that you need to make sure that your

00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,940
client understands and goes into this

00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:05,910
eyes wide open with all the information

00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:07,350
you have I certainly I'm not in the sell

00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:09,690
side i probably wouldn't lead with it if

00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:11,610
i was you but I think you know when you

00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:13,620
get in you don't want them to have the

00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:15,150
perception that it's free and then that

00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:17,820
there's no cost and so talking to them

00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:19,230
about how it's more effective or more

00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:21,180
efficient than what it is that they're

00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:22,950
paying now will probably be the way i

00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:25,140
would recommend you phrasing that is

00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:27,930
thinking about it in terms of you know

00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:31,170
you're paying x or for whatever tool you

00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:32,880
use now this tool is going to be more

00:22:31,170 --> 00:22:34,680
less expensive for you year-over-year

00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:37,410
but there are a few other costs that you

00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:38,460
want to make sure you're considering and

00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:40,530
i think it would help you have a better

00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:43,020
longer term relationship with whoever

00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:44,610
you work with that's what service for

00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:45,960
proprietary software to yes patent

00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:48,060
trolling is a risk and I just covered

00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:50,760
that one with a problem that we have so

00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:52,410
those that's a good point as well as the

00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:54,090
ability you next one has the ability to

00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:55,770
quickly put content messages to your

00:22:54,090 --> 00:22:56,519
customers increase your level of ideas

00:22:55,770 --> 00:23:00,509
as a

00:22:56,519 --> 00:23:04,580
innovated your work I think it's

00:23:00,509 --> 00:23:07,259
definitely allowed us to to be more in

00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:08,969
engaging with the guests and I use the

00:23:07,259 --> 00:23:11,009
example about the stores we didn't have

00:23:08,969 --> 00:23:13,649
the store specific profiles of the way

00:23:11,009 --> 00:23:15,389
we do now so one of the ways that we've

00:23:13,649 --> 00:23:17,789
been able to do that is we actually have

00:23:15,389 --> 00:23:19,349
they grew up to three hundred and fifty

00:23:17,789 --> 00:23:22,169
nine stores today or something like that

00:23:19,349 --> 00:23:23,849
so we have a Content administrator at

00:23:22,169 --> 00:23:25,429
each store that's able to publish the

00:23:23,849 --> 00:23:27,929
content that's relevant to their store

00:23:25,429 --> 00:23:29,820
so I think what what that's trying to do

00:23:27,929 --> 00:23:31,469
is help us connect again in a digital

00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:33,959
space the same way we do at a store

00:23:31,469 --> 00:23:35,579
level but the question about it

00:23:33,959 --> 00:23:40,619
increasing our level of ideas that's a

00:23:35,579 --> 00:23:42,690
good one we are looking at doing some

00:23:40,619 --> 00:23:44,849
other explorations you know I think

00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:48,059
Starbucks has a good program in place I

00:23:44,849 --> 00:23:49,950
think Pepsi has another good model for

00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:53,070
for how you can use your community to

00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:57,359
innovate so right now I'd say that's

00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:58,979
happening more in an analog mode more

00:23:57,359 --> 00:24:00,629
the comments that are received at the

00:23:58,979 --> 00:24:03,059
stores that are sometimes digital or

00:24:00,629 --> 00:24:04,820
sometimes handwritten and as those as

00:24:03,059 --> 00:24:08,759
those get to the marketing team and

00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:11,089
funnel up there's a lot of ability in

00:24:08,759 --> 00:24:14,249
our company for great ideas and

00:24:11,089 --> 00:24:16,469
decision-making to to to come up through

00:24:14,249 --> 00:24:19,049
the company versus versus top down and

00:24:16,469 --> 00:24:20,759
in a more traditional model so hopefully

00:24:19,049 --> 00:24:22,079
it'll evolve and create a greater

00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:23,789
transparency and a greater engagement

00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:26,879
with our guests which will lead to the

00:24:23,789 --> 00:24:28,859
question that Benjamin is the next one

00:24:26,879 --> 00:24:30,629
some clients used to tell me when I give

00:24:28,859 --> 00:24:33,440
them the budget about their requirement

00:24:30,629 --> 00:24:38,369
it's too expensive to be an open source

00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:40,039
how can I react I mean there there are

00:24:38,369 --> 00:24:41,999
costs there and I guess they have to

00:24:40,039 --> 00:24:43,679
they have to weigh it across their

00:24:41,999 --> 00:24:47,519
organization so the point that I was

00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:51,719
making earlier about you can't look at a

00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:53,399
specific item as the only cost if if you

00:24:51,719 --> 00:24:55,619
use seven different products from the

00:24:53,399 --> 00:24:57,509
same vendor you have to look at it I I

00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:59,969
recommend that you help them look at it

00:24:57,509 --> 00:25:01,200
across the portfolio and say well yeah

00:24:59,969 --> 00:25:03,450
it's great because they gave you this

00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,619
lower price but are you really happy

00:25:03,450 --> 00:25:06,570
with the seven different things that

00:25:04,619 --> 00:25:08,339
you're getting and if you add an eight

00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:09,789
thing from that same vendor how easy is

00:25:08,339 --> 00:25:12,519
it for you to get rid of anyone

00:25:09,789 --> 00:25:13,779
those things because again that's the

00:25:12,519 --> 00:25:16,509
model that we're seeing more with the

00:25:13,779 --> 00:25:18,879
partners we deal with is they're putting

00:25:16,509 --> 00:25:21,369
lots of pieces together to give you a

00:25:18,879 --> 00:25:24,879
lower cost because they're creating more

00:25:21,369 --> 00:25:26,979
barriers to exit right and so I think

00:25:24,879 --> 00:25:29,190
that that that's a way to help help them

00:25:26,979 --> 00:25:32,259
realize that there there are other costs

00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:33,759
and then I think there's probably also a

00:25:32,259 --> 00:25:34,960
part of it too if it in one of the

00:25:33,759 --> 00:25:37,450
things I'll talk about when what we

00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:39,249
learned is you know if they're planning

00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:40,869
on paying somebody to do all of the

00:25:39,249 --> 00:25:43,450
development work themselves maybe they

00:25:40,869 --> 00:25:45,309
perceive that cost to be to be higher

00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:47,109
than if they're what their internal team

00:25:45,309 --> 00:25:48,369
is able to do it and that's a little

00:25:47,109 --> 00:25:49,499
retooling so if I didn't get to

00:25:48,369 --> 00:25:53,529
everything that you wanted there

00:25:49,499 --> 00:26:01,029
Alexandra please reply back I think

00:25:53,529 --> 00:26:03,249
that's a excellent so what do we learn

00:26:01,029 --> 00:26:05,440
the development team here is changing

00:26:03,249 --> 00:26:07,989
from current technology to Drupal

00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:11,619
obviously so my team didn't have a lot

00:26:07,989 --> 00:26:13,179
of exposure to to Drupal so one of the

00:26:11,619 --> 00:26:15,419
things that we talked about and I would

00:26:13,179 --> 00:26:17,649
do a better job of moving forward is

00:26:15,419 --> 00:26:22,239
getting involved in the community early

00:26:17,649 --> 00:26:24,190
and recommending and getting active in

00:26:22,239 --> 00:26:26,679
your local meetups Drupal camps whatever

00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:30,940
way you can get involved and learn and

00:26:26,679 --> 00:26:32,440
share work with a partner to hold some

00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:36,609
multiple week Drupal development

00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:38,200
training I think that Drupal eyes me and

00:26:36,609 --> 00:26:40,720
some of those other sources are great I

00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:44,019
think that did having a deeper more

00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:46,269
focused introduction to the tool than

00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:50,470
the methodology and framework is is is

00:26:46,269 --> 00:26:52,419
very important one of the things that I

00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:55,929
would think about doing differently that

00:26:52,419 --> 00:26:58,389
I didn't do the first time was naturally

00:26:55,929 --> 00:27:00,070
or at least for me taking the existing

00:26:58,389 --> 00:27:02,019
team and having them continue to focus

00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:05,649
on the site because they know of the

00:27:02,019 --> 00:27:07,869
best and leveraging more the partner

00:27:05,649 --> 00:27:09,879
that you use to do the coding and build

00:27:07,869 --> 00:27:12,070
the Drupal site i would actually

00:27:09,879 --> 00:27:14,529
challenge your clients to think to do

00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:17,109
the opposite find somebody to come on

00:27:14,529 --> 00:27:19,419
and build and maintain your existing

00:27:17,109 --> 00:27:20,889
site for you so that you whatever team

00:27:19,419 --> 00:27:23,800
you imagine is going to be the long-term

00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:26,230
team is focused heavily with

00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:28,620
with the partner on building the site so

00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:30,970
that they can more easily maintain it

00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:32,410
that might be what you guys already

00:27:30,970 --> 00:27:35,620
recommend that wasn't what we did and

00:27:32,410 --> 00:27:37,060
something I would do differently and if

00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:42,070
at all possible be sure that do you

00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:44,230
bring in somebody on your team that has

00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:45,850
a significant amount of experience I

00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:48,490
think a partner is great and they can

00:27:45,850 --> 00:27:50,800
definitely bridge the gap but having

00:27:48,490 --> 00:27:52,990
somebody that has a stronger experience

00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:54,790
and a stronger track record is going to

00:27:52,990 --> 00:27:57,450
help your team grow and help your team

00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:59,530
feel more in control of their destiny

00:27:57,450 --> 00:28:01,660
and I've had a couple of other questions

00:27:59,530 --> 00:28:06,250
about but what kind of content do we

00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:09,010
hold or would we like it to hold I mean

00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:11,290
I think that the content that Drupal is

00:28:09,010 --> 00:28:13,510
able to hold now for our CMS system to

00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:15,070
hold it is more than adequate for our

00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:17,860
needs i think well what we're trying to

00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:20,830
do is is again more specifically target

00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:22,150
that content so thinking about it that

00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:24,040
way it's it's associating more

00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:25,240
attributes with the content and then as

00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:28,030
you're building the relationship with

00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:29,470
your guests and asking them questions

00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:31,570
more about what their what their

00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:33,670
affinity is their lifestyle preference

00:28:31,570 --> 00:28:35,020
using those attributes the surface

00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:36,430
content that's more and more relevant

00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:38,470
for them so we go and beyond the store

00:28:36,430 --> 00:28:41,320
and understanding that you are trying to

00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:43,300
reduce salt in your diet or your your

00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:44,890
gluten-free and beginning to expose blog

00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:46,870
articles that are about that or store

00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:48,580
events that are about that the same way

00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:50,110
you would in a relationship you might

00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:53,230
have a somebody in the store what what

00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:54,700
we're really looking to do the next

00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:56,680
question I have is what role did

00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:57,820
marketing plan the evaluation and how

00:28:56,680 --> 00:29:00,970
did you work together with them during

00:28:57,820 --> 00:29:03,100
the process we partnered on it so we

00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:05,020
came up with a list of evaluation

00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:07,270
criteria that was a mix of marketing

00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:08,710
needs and technology needs and kind of

00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:11,260
some company business objectives and

00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:13,480
then we vetted different platforms and

00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:14,980
also we use that selection criteria in

00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:19,150
determining our partner to help us build

00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:22,510
the site so I I'd say it was an even

00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:23,890
share and in how we and now we made the

00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:25,060
decision and the number of people that

00:29:23,890 --> 00:29:27,340
were a part of the decision making

00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:29,760
process so that answers your question

00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:29,760
Joe

00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:37,320
Oh whether the next question I have is

00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:39,180
were there things that made you think

00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:40,980
Drupal wasn't the option to go forward

00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:46,260
with and how would an account rep best

00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:48,570
put your mind at ease I think that you

00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:50,280
know coming into a completely new as an

00:29:48,570 --> 00:29:52,470
organization and not being exposed to

00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:56,430
Drupal it's it's certainly just a fear

00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:58,170
of the unknown how can this community

00:29:56,430 --> 00:30:00,420
and this open source platform compete

00:29:58,170 --> 00:30:02,670
with the likes of Oracle or Microsoft or

00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:06,270
these companies that you have billions

00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:10,950
of dollars to build a platform how will

00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:12,960
it scale you know the uncertainty about

00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:14,610
all this code being contributed from

00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:17,220
people and not having any visibility

00:30:14,610 --> 00:30:19,200
really to where they got that code from

00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:20,580
going back to the indemnity question so

00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:23,340
I think those are definitely things that

00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:27,060
that made us question early if Drupal

00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:28,500
was the right option I think that you

00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:30,150
know again being a good partner you're

00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:31,500
able to help your clients go through

00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:33,660
those questions one at a time look

00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:36,720
around obviously exposing them to some

00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:38,550
of the other very large fortune 100

00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:42,210
companies if not 500 companies that are

00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:43,590
on this platform that's another thing I

00:30:42,210 --> 00:30:45,150
think it would be powerful to do is

00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:47,460
figure out a way to help your client

00:30:45,150 --> 00:30:50,310
engage with other clients their size

00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:51,660
perhaps leveraging connections at drupal

00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:54,120
org i'm not i'm not exactly sure how

00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:56,580
that will work but some way to to give

00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:58,470
them the confidence i do that with our

00:30:56,580 --> 00:31:02,250
partner or other clients that are

00:30:58,470 --> 00:31:04,920
looking to to move to drupal we have you

00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:06,810
know conversations like this so to help

00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:12,240
them understand the decision-making that

00:31:06,810 --> 00:31:13,140
went through okay so go on from the dev

00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:17,250
team I think that's all the questions

00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:18,930
for now on the hosting so you know

00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:20,640
depending upon how you decide to do this

00:31:18,930 --> 00:31:22,140
I'm guessing most your clients are going

00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:26,070
to try to move everything they have from

00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:27,810
one place to to a new place so if you

00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:30,180
have a mix of hosting partners which we

00:31:27,810 --> 00:31:32,790
do we have some stuff at amazon and some

00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:34,350
stuff at Rackspace making sure that you

00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:37,650
involve them early on in the

00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:40,290
architecture it'll eliminate any longer

00:31:37,650 --> 00:31:42,450
term potential for finger-pointing and

00:31:40,290 --> 00:31:44,820
obviously will help the combined

00:31:42,450 --> 00:31:46,680
environments work the best way they can

00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:48,660
together

00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:50,940
for us it wasn't just a multi-phase

00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:52,530
approach of what we want to move this

00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:54,330
thing first into the Drupal stack and

00:31:52,530 --> 00:31:56,330
then we'll add this thing later there

00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:58,830
are some components that will never move

00:31:56,330 --> 00:32:02,370
like a single social sign-on tool that

00:31:58,830 --> 00:32:04,800
we already have a rating system that we

00:32:02,370 --> 00:32:06,570
would be harder for us to port out even

00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:08,520
if Drupal could do just a good as good a

00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:09,660
job if not better deported out and

00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:11,760
poured all the content on all the

00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:13,440
ratings and all of the users out so

00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:15,990
there'll be some things that will live

00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:17,010
need to live in harmony long term so

00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:18,180
figuring out how to work those

00:32:17,010 --> 00:32:20,460
integrations and make sure that the

00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:26,520
partners are involved early is another

00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:28,140
decision I'd make and that kind of the

00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:31,050
last area there that just real quick

00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:32,520
there's any new questions coming in was

00:32:31,050 --> 00:32:34,320
there a specific of topic training that

00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:36,090
your developers who had a little

00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:37,290
exposure to Drupal really engaged with

00:32:36,090 --> 00:32:40,020
and began to understand the power of

00:32:37,290 --> 00:32:41,640
platform I don't think there was a

00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:43,920
specific one and for me that's kind of

00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:46,830
my miss is that I probably would have

00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:48,450
worked with a partner to do some of the

00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:50,220
courses that Meghan outlined earlier in

00:32:48,450 --> 00:32:52,380
the session and intro to hello to Drupal

00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:54,990
followed up by a Drupal focused training

00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:57,180
organization that would do a week or two

00:32:54,990 --> 00:32:58,860
and I hope I'll say this in a way that's

00:32:57,180 --> 00:33:02,010
meaningful to all of you but as a non

00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:03,630
developer my perception is that there's

00:33:02,010 --> 00:33:06,270
there's a framework that you need to

00:33:03,630 --> 00:33:08,070
work within it's not the same kind of

00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:11,250
thing that you might do if you were just

00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:13,170
a great PHP developer for example and so

00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:15,270
making sure that they understand the

00:33:13,170 --> 00:33:17,400
framework that you work within and how I

00:33:15,270 --> 00:33:20,310
think also to engage with in the

00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:23,070
community and to to look for modules to

00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:25,470
help solve problems some of those things

00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:28,590
are different and and how you would do

00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:30,450
that then just googling a code fix for

00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:32,520
example and so I think a little more

00:33:30,450 --> 00:33:33,600
discipline up front and two how to get

00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:35,520
involved in the community how to

00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:37,230
leverage the framework would be things I

00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:39,060
would do differently but I don't have a

00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:45,630
specific one because I messed up and

00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:47,400
didn't do that Meghan ask the question

00:33:45,630 --> 00:33:49,710
back to the point I made is it would you

00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:51,780
guys all think that there's value in the

00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:55,980
association facilitating these kinds of

00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:58,830
intros where if you needed help to talk

00:33:55,980 --> 00:34:00,720
to a larger company on behalf of your

00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:02,640
client or put your client together with

00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:04,679
I don't know how big they could get but

00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:07,460
you guys all know you know time warner

00:34:04,679 --> 00:34:09,899
New York Stock Exchange White House

00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:11,190
being able to introduce them to and have

00:34:09,899 --> 00:34:12,450
some kinds of conversation so she's

00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:15,320
asking a question if you all think that

00:34:12,450 --> 00:34:17,190
would be valuable so if you do I guess

00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:18,810
we should do it you should figure out a

00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:21,090
way to make it happen yeah we can

00:34:18,810 --> 00:34:23,220
definitely do that hey the final areas

00:34:21,090 --> 00:34:25,409
we've talked about it great cute oh

00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:27,929
sorry I say we can certainly do that and

00:34:25,409 --> 00:34:30,679
even at drupalcon austin next year we're

00:34:27,929 --> 00:34:33,300
looking to have a site owner track so

00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:35,820
Brad and his peers can come together and

00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:39,179
get content and network and just learn

00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:41,040
how to expand drupal adoption and so

00:34:39,179 --> 00:34:42,629
we're definitely looking to make these

00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:44,190
touch points happen in the community but

00:34:42,629 --> 00:34:46,649
feel free to reach out and let me know

00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:48,480
what would work best for you and what

00:34:46,649 --> 00:34:56,490
your needs are because we're always

00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:58,140
evolving great last areas around the the

00:34:56,490 --> 00:34:59,310
overall Drupal community I've touched on

00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:01,800
it a few times but I've been really

00:34:59,310 --> 00:35:04,349
focused on developers one of the things

00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:06,690
that I would want to do differently is

00:35:04,349 --> 00:35:08,130
give my whole team involved early make

00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:09,630
sure that the analysts understand the

00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:11,490
roles that they can play in terms of

00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:14,220
helping write a requirement or perform a

00:35:11,490 --> 00:35:15,780
test on an existing module making sure

00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:17,760
that the marketers understand the

00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:21,780
ecosystem and how it works together and

00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:23,960
how by choosing to be involved you build

00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:27,000
the community which you know provides

00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:28,920
good things out but also opens up your

00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:31,310
connections an opportunity to bring good

00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:34,050
things in that that others are doing and

00:35:31,310 --> 00:35:36,480
that you know really just everybody can

00:35:34,050 --> 00:35:37,680
help everybody can help if we can if we

00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:40,589
can find what it is that you're

00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:41,820
passionate about which hopefully you

00:35:40,589 --> 00:35:44,430
guys feel like something like what I'm

00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:46,109
doing today is because I was passionate

00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:47,970
about trying to figure out how to help i

00:35:46,109 --> 00:35:50,730
was i was probably high on drupalcon

00:35:47,970 --> 00:35:52,290
portland when i met megan and i really

00:35:50,730 --> 00:35:53,460
wanted to figure out a way because the

00:35:52,290 --> 00:35:55,710
energy I felt that was something I

00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:58,710
wanted to participate in and it just

00:35:55,710 --> 00:36:00,030
wasn't clear to me and so that would be

00:35:58,710 --> 00:36:01,800
something that I would push my team

00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:06,869
stronger to do and something where we're

00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:08,640
definitely getting better it and then

00:36:06,869 --> 00:36:09,930
yeah just build awareness for the

00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:11,550
community so just got another question

00:36:09,930 --> 00:36:13,140
what role the marketing play in the

00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:14,350
evaluation I think that might be a

00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:16,390
duplicate

00:36:14,350 --> 00:36:18,190
sorry I think I got that one jokes but

00:36:16,390 --> 00:36:20,860
yeah just so it was a was a partnership

00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:22,120
between us to evaluate the software and

00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:26,290
that's how we work together there in

00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:27,730
building the selection criteria a couple

00:36:26,290 --> 00:36:29,590
of other points that I think are super

00:36:27,730 --> 00:36:31,570
relevant as you are probably all

00:36:29,590 --> 00:36:33,940
experiencing you know the demand for the

00:36:31,570 --> 00:36:36,430
talent and the price that the talent can

00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:38,740
demand is only going up as there's more

00:36:36,430 --> 00:36:41,080
demand for this product so I think it's

00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:42,490
important to let and make sure your

00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:44,890
clients know that and that they're

00:36:42,490 --> 00:36:47,320
thinking about that they have some

00:36:44,890 --> 00:36:49,090
market analysis to understand what the

00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:52,120
what the rate is if they choose to

00:36:49,090 --> 00:36:53,560
convert somebody knowing that they're

00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:55,060
going to build a lot into this person

00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:57,730
and it could make them more marketable I

00:36:55,060 --> 00:37:00,400
think also figuring out ways to grow

00:36:57,730 --> 00:37:02,230
your own talent so either working with

00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:04,210
the local community college or college

00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:06,640
to make sure that they're offering some

00:37:04,210 --> 00:37:10,900
course where it's going to provide the

00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:12,400
pipeline another program that I'll throw

00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:15,070
out that I'm trying to figure out how to

00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:17,530
do is we have a lot of veterans

00:37:15,070 --> 00:37:18,700
returning to the United States and I'm

00:37:17,530 --> 00:37:20,050
in the middle of trying to develop some

00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:21,760
curriculum that would give them some

00:37:20,050 --> 00:37:24,280
introduction to web technologies and

00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:25,930
particularly some focus on Drupal and

00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:27,700
and to try to provide internships for

00:37:25,930 --> 00:37:29,740
them so that you need to be creative as

00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:31,390
this as the demand for this product

00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:33,310
continues to grow so that you can bring

00:37:31,390 --> 00:37:35,140
in and build your own quality team so

00:37:33,310 --> 00:37:36,820
thinking about that is an important

00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:37,780
component that the leadership might not

00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:40,690
be thinking about but the technology

00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:43,930
team it your you're working with needs

00:37:40,690 --> 00:37:45,190
to be thinking about and just figuring

00:37:43,930 --> 00:37:47,260
out how to partnership with other firms

00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:50,020
to to host workshops as another idea

00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:51,670
we've been doing here in Austin orc with

00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:53,740
colleges to the build the curriculum and

00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:56,260
just figure out how to make it more

00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:57,610
accessible to to a younger generation so

00:37:56,260 --> 00:38:06,100
that we continue to build build that

00:37:57,610 --> 00:38:08,290
pipeline this is a very elaborate on

00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:10,120
what else you know so so the question

00:38:08,290 --> 00:38:13,390
that just came in is presumably where

00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:14,890
we're all in the in Drupal to win it can

00:38:13,390 --> 00:38:16,810
we elaborate on what other CMS is you

00:38:14,890 --> 00:38:18,160
looked at and that you're evaluating are

00:38:16,810 --> 00:38:20,380
there any items that triples competitors

00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:22,690
did better out in your mind certainly

00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:24,910
you know looked into Adobe WordPress

00:38:22,690 --> 00:38:27,470
attrition engine and several other

00:38:24,910 --> 00:38:29,480
products I

00:38:27,470 --> 00:38:31,040
there's some compelling tions you know

00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:33,170
with what what adobe is doing with how

00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:34,790
you can get licensing that you can share

00:38:33,170 --> 00:38:37,490
I think they just had an announcement

00:38:34,790 --> 00:38:40,010
last week that the content tools are now

00:38:37,490 --> 00:38:41,780
integrated into a platform that will

00:38:40,010 --> 00:38:44,930
allow them to create more responsive

00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:45,920
websites natively I think that there

00:38:44,930 --> 00:38:47,570
there are some things that are

00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:49,640
attractive there that you know you want

00:38:47,570 --> 00:38:51,349
to look at from when you say what are

00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:54,530
the tools that my developer currently

00:38:51,349 --> 00:38:57,680
uses today what's kind of the fewest

00:38:54,530 --> 00:38:58,700
changes or the fewest barriers so if

00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:00,530
they're using a different code

00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:02,270
repository that might be something to

00:39:00,530 --> 00:39:03,650
consider on the development side is

00:39:02,270 --> 00:39:05,990
there an easy integration with their

00:39:03,650 --> 00:39:07,369
project management tools we haven't

00:39:05,990 --> 00:39:09,020
really talked about that at all but but

00:39:07,369 --> 00:39:11,990
look you know helping guide them on that

00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:13,670
if they're you know vignette shop that's

00:39:11,990 --> 00:39:16,790
going to be huge change thinking about

00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:18,530
moving from TFS to to jira or base camp

00:39:16,790 --> 00:39:20,540
or whatever you might you know help them

00:39:18,530 --> 00:39:22,490
recommend whatever code repositories

00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:24,200
they're using and how they push and

00:39:22,490 --> 00:39:26,270
deploy would be different and similarly

00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:28,369
on the content side what tools are they

00:39:26,270 --> 00:39:30,080
using to create and how easy is it for

00:39:28,369 --> 00:39:32,540
them to integrate with a given platform

00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:35,089
are definitely things that we considered

00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:36,920
in and caused frankly a few products to

00:39:35,089 --> 00:39:38,450
rise a little bit higher than Drupal but

00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:39,800
I think again when you take a step back

00:39:38,450 --> 00:39:41,300
as a business and look at okay well

00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:42,589
what's our overall investment in Adobe

00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:46,220
and who owns Adobe and what are they

00:39:42,589 --> 00:39:48,320
doing what else do we have with them and

00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:51,440
then again I don't want to lose sight

00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:53,780
that what we really liked a lot about

00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:56,540
this is the ability to create the unique

00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:58,520
experience that we know we want and what

00:39:56,540 --> 00:40:01,670
tools were going to give us the the most

00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:03,830
capability to do that at a pace that's

00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:05,270
right for us and not wait on a release

00:40:03,830 --> 00:40:07,940
cycle so those are some of the things

00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:10,640
that caused competitors that might have

00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:13,849
risen in one or two areas to lose

00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:18,640
overall hopefully that got you close to

00:40:13,849 --> 00:40:20,319
what you wanted there Dave so

00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:21,640
mission is what if someone in my

00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:23,140
position need to get up to speed about

00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:24,460
Drupal 8 and how come partners and

00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:28,180
vendors best approach clients to start

00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:31,299
the triple a conversation um I think

00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:32,500
that the presentation the Drees did and

00:40:31,299 --> 00:40:37,559
then I got to see the gentleman from

00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:41,880
Symphony speak it drupalcon gives me a

00:40:37,559 --> 00:40:43,869
strong insight into what it can do I

00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:46,269
think the timeline is going to be

00:40:43,869 --> 00:40:50,319
different depending upon the size of

00:40:46,269 --> 00:40:53,710
your client maybe the the level of risk

00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:55,329
that they accept like I would not think

00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:57,910
that Drupal 8 would be right for us for

00:40:55,329 --> 00:40:59,829
probably two years and partly that's

00:40:57,910 --> 00:41:01,690
because I've only been on Drupal 7

00:40:59,829 --> 00:41:04,000
platform for one year and so doing a

00:41:01,690 --> 00:41:05,619
major site redesign you know you need to

00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:09,670
get some return on investment before you

00:41:05,619 --> 00:41:11,740
can do it secondly we don't want to be a

00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:14,289
technology company an early adopter so

00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:16,029
we'd rather wait and and as I say kind

00:41:14,289 --> 00:41:18,010
of ride the wave let some others go

00:41:16,029 --> 00:41:19,690
before us and start to figure out kind

00:41:18,010 --> 00:41:23,799
of what's best to breed that we can

00:41:19,690 --> 00:41:25,720
adopt and the third thing is you know

00:41:23,799 --> 00:41:28,089
just make sure that it's make sure that

00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:29,650
it's a mature product so I would want to

00:41:28,089 --> 00:41:30,940
you know want to know again if the size

00:41:29,650 --> 00:41:33,789
of the company what's their risk for

00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:35,170
trying something new so I think exposing

00:41:33,789 --> 00:41:39,069
them to that there's a path there and

00:41:35,170 --> 00:41:41,410
exposing them to in my small development

00:41:39,069 --> 00:41:43,630
mind how much more flexible and API

00:41:41,410 --> 00:41:45,309
driven it's going to be are things that

00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:47,980
are exciting to us because it lets me

00:41:45,309 --> 00:41:49,599
consider how i can change back end and

00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:51,069
integration points out with with a

00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:53,140
little bit more users kind of some high

00:41:51,069 --> 00:41:54,819
level things I took away with it the

00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:57,819
partnership with symphony and a stronger

00:41:54,819 --> 00:42:00,190
framework is interesting as well but for

00:41:57,819 --> 00:42:01,839
me it's a little early to to think about

00:42:00,190 --> 00:42:04,750
building a site out based upon the level

00:42:01,839 --> 00:42:10,569
investment we have and where I see it

00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:14,099
isn't evolving in the marketplace the

00:42:10,569 --> 00:42:14,099
excellence is looking to switch the

00:42:17,670 --> 00:42:22,089
duplo shop finds an account who's

00:42:19,930 --> 00:42:24,069
looking to switch their CMS how can a

00:42:22,089 --> 00:42:25,900
shop help them with that evaluation and

00:42:24,069 --> 00:42:26,920
best pitch Drupal in their business well

00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:30,869
hopefully some of the things I've said

00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:32,260
today will give you some insight um I

00:42:30,869 --> 00:42:33,760
think that

00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:37,810
it's you know really looking at what

00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:39,910
their needs are and this is something I

00:42:37,810 --> 00:42:42,400
I try to focus on going back to the

00:42:39,910 --> 00:42:43,720
win-win thing I'm not saying this should

00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,920
be your answer but sometimes it's okay

00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:46,150
letting the partner know that this isn't

00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:49,480
the right time or this isn't the right

00:42:46,150 --> 00:42:51,040
product for you and in just being a

00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:53,680
being a good partner I think when they

00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:55,060
have a compelling interest you know

00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:56,560
selling the story selling the points

00:42:55,060 --> 00:42:58,780
that we had today and making sure they

00:42:56,560 --> 00:43:01,000
understand the full cost so a lot of

00:42:58,780 --> 00:43:02,470
what your question is Jose is kind of

00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:05,410
what I'm trying to do today is give some

00:43:02,470 --> 00:43:10,900
insight into what else it is that that

00:43:05,410 --> 00:43:12,370
we're evaluating on and and making sure

00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:15,070
that their overall team is involved i

00:43:12,370 --> 00:43:16,540
think if if you if you get to technology

00:43:15,070 --> 00:43:17,410
focused and don't involve the marketing

00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:19,270
team then that's going to be really

00:43:17,410 --> 00:43:20,530
disruptive for them if you only involve

00:43:19,270 --> 00:43:22,330
a marketing team and not the technology

00:43:20,530 --> 00:43:24,370
team and that's who they're going to be

00:43:22,330 --> 00:43:25,510
disruptive to the technology team or or

00:43:24,370 --> 00:43:27,610
you look at the option of maybe

00:43:25,510 --> 00:43:29,710
outsourcing the technological component

00:43:27,610 --> 00:43:31,270
with somebody who can host it and manage

00:43:29,710 --> 00:43:33,820
it forum or a long term relationship

00:43:31,270 --> 00:43:35,320
with you as the partner to tell us to

00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:37,900
deploy for them and those kinds of

00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:40,890
things so it kind of depends on I guess

00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:40,890
what they're trying to get out of it

00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:47,430
another question and how high up the

00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:50,200
company did the final CMS decision go I

00:43:47,430 --> 00:43:51,790
involved our sea level team so for us

00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:53,830
that's the highest level and technology

00:43:51,790 --> 00:43:56,200
and marketing so they were two drivers

00:43:53,830 --> 00:43:58,780
and part of probably the final five to

00:43:56,200 --> 00:44:00,610
seven people that made the made the

00:43:58,780 --> 00:44:08,740
final decision so I think that they were

00:44:00,610 --> 00:44:10,120
they were heavily engaged the next

00:44:08,740 --> 00:44:11,560
question is what considerations have you

00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:12,970
given to integrated commerce package

00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:15,640
this one a Drupal platform ubercart

00:44:12,970 --> 00:44:18,060
commerce etc I say we've been looking

00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:22,840
hard at it we have a current commerce

00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:24,310
provider one of the things that we have

00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:26,740
to think about and would be another

00:44:24,310 --> 00:44:28,390
point to advise your clients in regards

00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:32,400
to commerce in general is just what the

00:44:28,390 --> 00:44:34,900
PCI implications are with it and for us

00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:37,480
tax is an important and complicated

00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:40,030
thing you'd be surprised how many

00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:41,920
different legislative entities want to

00:44:40,030 --> 00:44:44,800
tax on if the water is bubbly and

00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:46,210
flavored versus flat so there's kind of

00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:48,250
a complicated product hierarchy

00:44:46,210 --> 00:44:50,650
they're so those are some some things

00:44:48,250 --> 00:44:53,800
that that we're looking to move towards

00:44:50,650 --> 00:44:56,020
I think we're will evolve over time is

00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:58,900
is connecting closer to our point of

00:44:56,020 --> 00:45:00,940
sale and and not because we don't think

00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:02,859
that the Drupal commerce is a platform

00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:04,780
that can be successful it's because a

00:45:02,859 --> 00:45:06,550
lot of what ours is about is what

00:45:04,780 --> 00:45:09,520
products do we have in the store at this

00:45:06,550 --> 00:45:11,170
time but you might want and we need to

00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:12,490
know that directly from the point of

00:45:11,170 --> 00:45:14,140
sale and then when getting back to kind

00:45:12,490 --> 00:45:16,119
of the taxing and the credit card

00:45:14,140 --> 00:45:19,330
transactions I'd say that we want to

00:45:16,119 --> 00:45:21,700
continue to use Drupal as our content

00:45:19,330 --> 00:45:23,349
and experience front end but we'll

00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:25,630
probably plug in different integration

00:45:23,349 --> 00:45:28,570
points based upon more of the supply

00:45:25,630 --> 00:45:33,550
chain in the fulfillment that we that we

00:45:28,570 --> 00:45:34,660
already have investment in okay I think

00:45:33,550 --> 00:45:36,010
that's it for the questions for now so

00:45:34,660 --> 00:45:37,240
going back to i think my last one here

00:45:36,010 --> 00:45:40,060
and it's good we've got a few minutes

00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:41,560
till i'm training there's never enough

00:45:40,060 --> 00:45:43,599
time but you've got to try it you've got

00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:44,770
to push that I think that's another I

00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:46,210
would do something different as we

00:45:44,770 --> 00:45:48,220
talked about with the developers but

00:45:46,210 --> 00:45:50,440
it's also thinking about how you can

00:45:48,220 --> 00:45:51,640
come be creative with training with with

00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:53,230
everybody that's going to use the

00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:55,780
product because you know change is

00:45:53,230 --> 00:45:58,780
always hard so if you don't practice a

00:45:55,780 --> 00:46:00,880
lot then on day one is too huge amount

00:45:58,780 --> 00:46:02,230
of change and it's very disruptive so

00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:04,480
some options that I hope you find are

00:46:02,230 --> 00:46:06,730
useful that that I would do differently

00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:08,920
is think about building and standing up

00:46:06,730 --> 00:46:11,890
some internal marketing sites or some

00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:16,089
internal maybe it's a project site some

00:46:11,890 --> 00:46:18,430
way that it lets your client have a

00:46:16,089 --> 00:46:21,609
chance to practice with the tool in a

00:46:18,430 --> 00:46:23,770
way that's not production right a way

00:46:21,609 --> 00:46:26,740
that you can allow them to push content

00:46:23,770 --> 00:46:28,210
go through the process edit stuff have

00:46:26,740 --> 00:46:31,660
your development team build modules

00:46:28,210 --> 00:46:33,550
deploy modules so that's hopefully an

00:46:31,660 --> 00:46:34,540
idea that you'll find valuable and

00:46:33,550 --> 00:46:36,760
something that I wish we'd done

00:46:34,540 --> 00:46:38,619
differently is again standing up some

00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:41,109
kind of internal site or sites that lets

00:46:38,619 --> 00:46:42,580
everybody practice and play with it so

00:46:41,109 --> 00:46:44,170
they can learn how to do their job and

00:46:42,580 --> 00:46:45,849
learn some of the problems and

00:46:44,170 --> 00:46:47,140
complications that that they don't even

00:46:45,849 --> 00:46:49,180
tell you that they're doing every day

00:46:47,140 --> 00:46:51,190
until you go live and then you find out

00:46:49,180 --> 00:46:53,380
of oh my god I do it this way we never

00:46:51,190 --> 00:46:56,280
told me that like as they practice do it

00:46:53,380 --> 00:46:56,280
they'll realize it

00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:04,540
so I don't have any other questions

00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:08,520
coming in but we have I think another 10

00:47:04,540 --> 00:47:08,520
minutes or so see if anything pops up

00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:26,150
Oh Mike is the question around sea level

00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:28,520
decision maker sorry like a CX ocio CMO

00:47:26,150 --> 00:47:30,550
at the term we use internally to trying

00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:32,720
to decide what we have our c team which

00:47:30,550 --> 00:47:35,630
in the case of this decision making was

00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:38,660
our CIO or CTO and RCM our chief

00:47:35,630 --> 00:47:43,090
marketing officer and then our e team is

00:47:38,660 --> 00:47:43,090
kind of the next level now good question

00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:50,180
next question is did they require a demo

00:47:48,170 --> 00:47:52,250
on the use of Drupal I think yeah that's

00:47:50,180 --> 00:47:55,040
definitely part of our evaluation to

00:47:52,250 --> 00:47:59,060
make a big investment like we did and to

00:47:55,040 --> 00:48:00,710
be able to figure out ways that other

00:47:59,060 --> 00:48:01,940
companies are using it so one of the

00:48:00,710 --> 00:48:03,590
things that we worked with our partner

00:48:01,940 --> 00:48:05,750
on was getting some non-competes in

00:48:03,590 --> 00:48:08,090
place so that we could go sit down with

00:48:05,750 --> 00:48:09,830
other shops that use it talk to their

00:48:08,090 --> 00:48:12,200
marketing team over a day or two visit

00:48:09,830 --> 00:48:13,520
sometimes how's this product working

00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:15,050
what do you think so far how long have

00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:16,910
you been using what's your strategy is

00:48:15,050 --> 00:48:18,350
it helping you achieve your strategy so

00:48:16,910 --> 00:48:20,180
I think some site visits again depend

00:48:18,350 --> 00:48:22,190
upon the size of your client and how

00:48:20,180 --> 00:48:23,840
much investment they're going to make in

00:48:22,190 --> 00:48:26,750
this all those kinds of things are more

00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:28,990
important so they didn't ask to see a

00:48:26,750 --> 00:48:31,100
demo from the standpoint of take me to

00:48:28,990 --> 00:48:32,390
Drupal eyes me show me how a module

00:48:31,100 --> 00:48:34,430
works it was more let's sit down with

00:48:32,390 --> 00:48:36,290
another business our peer group that's

00:48:34,430 --> 00:48:38,030
converted and talked to them about what

00:48:36,290 --> 00:48:40,370
the experience has been like and how

00:48:38,030 --> 00:48:41,720
happy they are what challenges they've

00:48:40,370 --> 00:48:44,570
had so we did that with a few different

00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:46,250
few different colleagues with a few

00:48:44,570 --> 00:48:53,090
different different platforms to help in

00:48:46,250 --> 00:48:57,500
the evaluation thanks max appreciate

00:48:53,090 --> 00:48:58,880
that next one was

00:48:57,500 --> 00:49:01,580
the biggest negative of Drupal and how

00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:02,600
did you overcome the objection I mean

00:49:01,580 --> 00:49:03,710
going back to some of the points earlier

00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:05,750
I don't know that there were there were

00:49:03,710 --> 00:49:07,730
negatives it's just you know it's the

00:49:05,750 --> 00:49:09,440
normal human behavior of fear of change

00:49:07,730 --> 00:49:12,440
and fear of the unknown and what is this

00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:16,160
Drupal thing and so I think it's really

00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:17,630
exposing to your clients how I feel in

00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:19,970
just the last couple of years maybe five

00:49:17,630 --> 00:49:24,410
years you've seen this seismic shift

00:49:19,970 --> 00:49:26,810
from nonprofits and colleges and

00:49:24,410 --> 00:49:30,410
universities using it in really cool and

00:49:26,810 --> 00:49:33,950
exciting ways to to a to a big

00:49:30,410 --> 00:49:36,410
enterprise utilization and creating

00:49:33,950 --> 00:49:37,940
awareness for them that yeah we realize

00:49:36,410 --> 00:49:39,710
this is a big decision and we just want

00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:42,470
to reinforce with you that there are

00:49:39,710 --> 00:49:44,810
many other big businesses that use this

00:49:42,470 --> 00:49:46,930
and obviously it's really compelling if

00:49:44,810 --> 00:49:49,400
they're in a similar market space right

00:49:46,930 --> 00:49:51,800
if they're you know if they're heavy

00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:53,990
into advertisement show them what the

00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:56,600
time warner suites doing and some of the

00:49:53,990 --> 00:49:57,980
other big players if they're really

00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:59,390
social you know if there's some great

00:49:57,980 --> 00:50:01,370
nonprofit sites that are out there that

00:49:59,390 --> 00:50:02,960
do great things and obviously I looked

00:50:01,370 --> 00:50:04,190
you know to the White House is a huge

00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:06,380
example of something that scales

00:50:04,190 --> 00:50:09,220
something that has tons of volume has a

00:50:06,380 --> 00:50:11,570
lot of interactivity so finding finding

00:50:09,220 --> 00:50:13,820
examples for them that are or who they

00:50:11,570 --> 00:50:15,140
aspire to be or who who they want to be

00:50:13,820 --> 00:50:17,000
what the product they want to have in

00:50:15,140 --> 00:50:19,430
the marketplace I think really helps

00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:20,870
overcome any fear or concern they have

00:50:19,430 --> 00:50:26,270
around it being a viable long-term

00:50:20,870 --> 00:50:32,510
platform questions are coming in well

00:50:26,270 --> 00:50:34,040
now partners um Davis if I'm comfortable

00:50:32,510 --> 00:50:36,140
talking about the Drupal partners we

00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:37,910
selected sure yeah i mean i think that

00:50:36,140 --> 00:50:39,620
when we say drupal there's you know

00:50:37,910 --> 00:50:41,300
there's there's a kind of a content

00:50:39,620 --> 00:50:42,800
component there's a development

00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:45,290
component and there's a hosting

00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:48,260
component and we exploit a few different

00:50:45,290 --> 00:50:51,890
players we had some great work done with

00:50:48,260 --> 00:50:55,340
the vml and initially went with aquifer

00:50:51,890 --> 00:50:56,840
for hosting and managed services again

00:50:55,340 --> 00:50:59,630
we knew it was a technology we weren't

00:50:56,840 --> 00:51:01,700
familiar with and we were concerned that

00:50:59,630 --> 00:51:03,320
our internal team would be able to scale

00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:06,710
and understand the technology in a way

00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:09,230
that would support our website volume so

00:51:06,710 --> 00:51:10,819
we've created a partnership with aqua to

00:51:09,230 --> 00:51:13,380
help us with that

00:51:10,819 --> 00:51:14,670
next part of your question is once you

00:51:13,380 --> 00:51:17,069
decided on Drupal what was a vendor

00:51:14,670 --> 00:51:19,170
partner selection process like I think

00:51:17,069 --> 00:51:22,079
it was kind of has it was hand in hand

00:51:19,170 --> 00:51:24,119
as we were looking at the different CMS

00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:26,459
systems that we wanted to evaluate we

00:51:24,119 --> 00:51:28,920
were also looking at who is effective

00:51:26,459 --> 00:51:31,499
and who has a strong track record for

00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:33,959
content creative and development in

00:51:31,499 --> 00:51:35,519
these areas and so that I'd say there

00:51:33,959 --> 00:51:36,869
were lots of conversations and

00:51:35,519 --> 00:51:38,670
discussions where when we would meet

00:51:36,869 --> 00:51:42,179
with other companies or we would meet

00:51:38,670 --> 00:51:43,469
with you know an agency they would be

00:51:42,179 --> 00:51:44,969
talking about the different technologies

00:51:43,469 --> 00:51:47,279
with us so it wasn't really a separated

00:51:44,969 --> 00:51:52,499
discussion for us it was was it was

00:51:47,279 --> 00:51:53,579
coming with a lot Tom ask meagan if

00:51:52,499 --> 00:51:55,319
these slides are available yes I think

00:51:53,579 --> 00:51:57,179
Megan's recording all this so the slides

00:51:55,319 --> 00:52:04,589
will be available as well as all of the

00:51:57,179 --> 00:52:06,119
question and answer and then Jeff wanted

00:52:04,589 --> 00:52:07,949
to know what else what else we looked at

00:52:06,119 --> 00:52:10,079
my memory is the ones that I mentioned

00:52:07,949 --> 00:52:12,059
in WordPress expressions Adobe and we

00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:13,170
were a wordpress site before so that

00:52:12,059 --> 00:52:21,179
would be another one that we included

00:52:13,170 --> 00:52:22,289
the evaluation so that's five when you

00:52:21,179 --> 00:52:24,749
started looking for information about

00:52:22,289 --> 00:52:26,729
Drupal on the web papers presentations

00:52:24,749 --> 00:52:28,529
owner how did you find that experience

00:52:26,729 --> 00:52:30,479
and what would have made it easier and

00:52:28,529 --> 00:52:32,789
better I think I think our partner guy

00:52:30,479 --> 00:52:34,619
to this lie on that like I can remember

00:52:32,789 --> 00:52:36,929
earlier trying to hire Drupal and

00:52:34,619 --> 00:52:40,229
getting guidance from aqueon where to

00:52:36,929 --> 00:52:41,849
post jobs how I needed to be active in

00:52:40,229 --> 00:52:43,640
the community and have a profile to have

00:52:41,849 --> 00:52:47,369
any kind of credibility and attract

00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:48,989
talent so I think that it's that's

00:52:47,369 --> 00:52:50,789
another great thing that you guys can

00:52:48,989 --> 00:52:52,920
help the companies with is how to get

00:52:50,789 --> 00:52:54,959
involved in and you know where to look

00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:57,089
for partners and if you only do

00:52:54,959 --> 00:52:59,459
development you know having a having a

00:52:57,089 --> 00:53:00,630
you know a referral for for a creative

00:52:59,459 --> 00:53:05,279
side that you can work collaboratively

00:53:00,630 --> 00:53:07,049
with are always strong I think naturally

00:53:05,279 --> 00:53:08,880
you know drupal.org is another great

00:53:07,049 --> 00:53:10,890
site for us to find and be active in the

00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:12,929
community and and find the resources I

00:53:10,890 --> 00:53:16,109
think when it got down to wanting to

00:53:12,929 --> 00:53:19,589
talk to other companies we are fortunate

00:53:16,109 --> 00:53:22,109
in that if we make calls or people know

00:53:19,589 --> 00:53:24,539
people at other companies they're always

00:53:22,109 --> 00:53:26,059
open to us having conversations

00:53:24,539 --> 00:53:29,489
especially if they're not a competitor

00:53:26,059 --> 00:53:30,839
so you know we can we can get in the

00:53:29,489 --> 00:53:34,049
door of other of other companies that

00:53:30,839 --> 00:53:35,549
have those kinds of conversations so

00:53:34,049 --> 00:53:37,140
when it came to finding those other

00:53:35,549 --> 00:53:38,549
companies that wasn't a resource I did

00:53:37,140 --> 00:53:41,459
on the web it was more networking within

00:53:38,549 --> 00:53:43,380
my own company of who knows who here and

00:53:41,459 --> 00:53:45,869
obviously probably the same way you guys

00:53:43,380 --> 00:53:47,309
do life stuff just just googling anyone

00:53:45,869 --> 00:53:48,929
that's made an announcement about their

00:53:47,309 --> 00:53:51,299
sights on Drupal who are they what do

00:53:48,929 --> 00:53:53,279
they do is their business like ours but

00:53:51,299 --> 00:53:54,949
I'd say my partner in and the Drupal

00:53:53,279 --> 00:53:59,339
site were probably the two biggest

00:53:54,949 --> 00:54:00,539
sources of information well making it

00:53:59,339 --> 00:54:02,130
easier Joe it'd be easier if somebody

00:54:00,539 --> 00:54:04,619
did it all for me you know I mean it's

00:54:02,130 --> 00:54:06,509
like it if I could go to Gartner or

00:54:04,619 --> 00:54:07,859
Forrester which you know you can and

00:54:06,509 --> 00:54:11,099
that'd be another good resource for your

00:54:07,859 --> 00:54:12,779
for your for your partners is looking at

00:54:11,099 --> 00:54:14,849
kind of the magic quadrant is the

00:54:12,779 --> 00:54:16,169
gardener phrase right if those clients

00:54:14,849 --> 00:54:18,539
already have access to those resources

00:54:16,169 --> 00:54:20,219
they're great because you can look at

00:54:18,539 --> 00:54:22,469
CMS and see how it's evaluated using

00:54:20,219 --> 00:54:24,809
that criteria and oftentimes you can get

00:54:22,469 --> 00:54:26,910
from those articles other companies that

00:54:24,809 --> 00:54:28,049
are using it and if they are part of the

00:54:26,910 --> 00:54:30,329
gardener group oftentimes they'll

00:54:28,049 --> 00:54:32,429
provide information back about what

00:54:30,329 --> 00:54:33,569
their experience has been so those be

00:54:32,429 --> 00:54:36,559
two other resources that i didn't

00:54:33,569 --> 00:54:36,559
mention that hopefully will help you

00:54:40,130 --> 00:54:43,919
next question is this a good one I'm

00:54:42,329 --> 00:54:45,989
done about this only give a second

00:54:43,919 --> 00:54:47,549
thought to court do you see only big

00:54:45,989 --> 00:54:49,289
agencies getting the contracts in the

00:54:47,549 --> 00:54:52,699
enterprise builder do you see chances

00:54:49,289 --> 00:54:55,589
for small agencies and freelancers I

00:54:52,699 --> 00:54:59,219
think it's for me it's it's matching the

00:54:55,589 --> 00:55:02,729
right company and skills to be

00:54:59,219 --> 00:55:06,359
successful with the project so I don't

00:55:02,729 --> 00:55:10,469
naturally gravitate towards a big

00:55:06,359 --> 00:55:12,749
company I I try and research the company

00:55:10,469 --> 00:55:14,459
to understand what you're good at what

00:55:12,749 --> 00:55:16,739
would it what is your area of expertise

00:55:14,459 --> 00:55:19,979
and nobody should advertise that they're

00:55:16,739 --> 00:55:21,449
good at everything so will we again

00:55:19,979 --> 00:55:23,400
trying to find win-win relationships we

00:55:21,449 --> 00:55:25,079
won't put partners and we want to put

00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:27,539
partners in position so everyone is

00:55:25,079 --> 00:55:28,979
going to be successful so for me it's a

00:55:27,539 --> 00:55:31,259
lot about the engagement one I want to

00:55:28,979 --> 00:55:33,299
get out of it so we have used some big

00:55:31,259 --> 00:55:35,159
shops like DML and alia we're also

00:55:33,299 --> 00:55:36,900
working with a with a local shop that

00:55:35,159 --> 00:55:38,400
hopefully will be able to create some

00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:41,069
exciting news on soon

00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:44,700
and it's a five person team so I think

00:55:41,069 --> 00:55:47,609
that we try to put people in position to

00:55:44,700 --> 00:55:49,410
be successful so for me it doesn't

00:55:47,609 --> 00:55:50,549
matter I would say that you know that's

00:55:49,410 --> 00:55:51,660
probably a question that you want to

00:55:50,549 --> 00:55:52,740
know from your partner because if

00:55:51,660 --> 00:55:55,109
they're they may be more apprehensive

00:55:52,740 --> 00:55:56,490
about a smaller shop but if you really

00:55:55,109 --> 00:55:59,309
focus on letting people do with their

00:55:56,490 --> 00:56:01,079
good at there's a lot of 125 man shops

00:55:59,309 --> 00:56:07,710
out there that can that can do some

00:56:01,079 --> 00:56:09,150
great stuff um next question was how can

00:56:07,710 --> 00:56:11,789
we measure performance or tune with

00:56:09,150 --> 00:56:14,250
Drupal site Krishna that's something

00:56:11,789 --> 00:56:16,619
that I cannot help you answer I will

00:56:14,250 --> 00:56:19,140
admit that that's a big part of what at

00:56:16,619 --> 00:56:20,609
what I use aquaphor so I'm not familiar

00:56:19,140 --> 00:56:22,799
with what tools would be out there

00:56:20,609 --> 00:56:24,869
making can we get there's no resource

00:56:22,799 --> 00:56:27,420
for for tuning and performance with with

00:56:24,869 --> 00:56:31,400
Drupal sites yeah Krishna I'll follow up

00:56:27,420 --> 00:56:31,400
directly and point you to some resources

00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:47,010
right doing more questions nothing else

00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:49,529
was popping up well Brad this was really

00:56:47,010 --> 00:56:51,930
a really thorough presentation and I

00:56:49,529 --> 00:56:53,430
think it's clear that it really

00:56:51,930 --> 00:56:55,559
resonated with everyone cuz we had some

00:56:53,430 --> 00:56:59,250
really strong questions and answers and

00:56:55,559 --> 00:57:00,660
um and hopefully this will be kind of

00:56:59,250 --> 00:57:02,670
the start of all the knowledge sharing

00:57:00,660 --> 00:57:04,799
for our Drupal businesses you talked

00:57:02,670 --> 00:57:06,839
about me being your CMO on here to to

00:57:04,799 --> 00:57:08,579
kind of give his his or her perspective

00:57:06,839 --> 00:57:11,430
of what that evaluation process look

00:57:08,579 --> 00:57:12,660
like and and and how to sell it to a CMO

00:57:11,430 --> 00:57:16,619
cuz that's a whole nother kind of

00:57:12,660 --> 00:57:19,829
conversation right yes yeah well that's

00:57:16,619 --> 00:57:22,740
great well I if anyone has any more

00:57:19,829 --> 00:57:26,640
questions feel free to email them to me

00:57:22,740 --> 00:57:30,089

00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:31,380
i'm happy to send them over to you Brad

00:57:30,089 --> 00:57:33,150
if you don't mind that would be great

00:57:31,380 --> 00:57:34,740
and then what we could do is answer them

00:57:33,150 --> 00:57:37,500
through a blog post to get them out to

00:57:34,740 --> 00:57:39,000
everybody that way yeah yeah definitely

00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:40,230
fill out the survey and other ideas you

00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:42,690
have again I don't want this to be a

00:57:40,230 --> 00:57:44,339
one-time shot for me so if there's other

00:57:42,690 --> 00:57:46,260
topics that I can help address I'd love

00:57:44,339 --> 00:57:48,480
to do that or I can engage other team

00:57:46,260 --> 00:57:50,640
members here to bring other areas of the

00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:51,930
business to talk to you and answer

00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:54,960
questions that you have so

00:57:51,930 --> 00:57:57,420
gosh no that's great and if there's

00:57:54,960 --> 00:58:00,300
other topics that anyone wants to hear

00:57:57,420 --> 00:58:02,940
about to help your business whether it's

00:58:00,300 --> 00:58:04,380
around talent acquisition or expanding

00:58:02,940 --> 00:58:05,970
sales and marketing I see there's a

00:58:04,380 --> 00:58:09,030
certain someone here with an expertise

00:58:05,970 --> 00:58:10,230
in marketing automation with topics like

00:58:09,030 --> 00:58:11,880
that we just want to hear all the

00:58:10,230 --> 00:58:14,160
different ways that we can help you and

00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:16,530
we'll find speakers like bread to

00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:18,210
present on that app so let us know in

00:58:16,530 --> 00:58:20,130
the survey but in the meantime let me

00:58:18,210 --> 00:58:22,260
just do my little plug of some things

00:58:20,130 --> 00:58:24,000
coming up again we've got drupalcon
