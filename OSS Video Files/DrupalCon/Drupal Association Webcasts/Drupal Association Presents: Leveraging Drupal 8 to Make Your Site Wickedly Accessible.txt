look and see if you can donate to make

00:02:20,069 --> 00:02:27,870

00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:30,600
smoothly and promptly and without

00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:32,820
further ado let me introduce our guest

website so Mike I will let you take over

00:02:53,420 --> 00:03:00,180
Thank You Lauren so first of all drupal

00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:03,030
7 was pretty good we did it is still the

00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:05,190
most accessible CMS out there the

00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:06,870
WordPress folks are referring to two

00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:08,880
Drupal's accessibility and trying to

00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:10,650
emulate that and they're coming along

00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:12,780
pretty quickly with with their

00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:14,700
accessibility but they've got a long

00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:16,530
ways to go because of the work that's

00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:19,370
being done on Drupal 7 and getting

00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:21,780
Drupal sevens accessibility up and ready

00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:23,370
but Drupal 8 is going to be even better

00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:26,489
than Drupal 7 there's a bunch of stuff

00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:29,160
that that is is built into Drupal 8 that

00:03:26,489 --> 00:03:32,760
that we couldn't get accomplishing in in

00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:34,739
Drupal 7 and that are just really large

00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:37,200
benefits for anyone who's who's

00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:38,790
implementing a Drupal website and stuff

00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:42,140
that the service is coming out of the

00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:45,780
box we really work to try and make

00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:47,880
Drupal be as accessible as possible by

00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:50,100
default and instead of having something

00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:54,299
that was them and add on that you needed

00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:56,730
to install afterwards or work with as an

00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:59,120
extension of core we wanted it to be an

00:03:56,730 --> 00:04:01,130
integral part of course oh that that the

00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,480
sites whether whether they were

00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:06,299
intentionally or not intentionally built

00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:08,190
to be accessible inherited the the best

00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:12,090
practice the breast with best practices

00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:14,910
of web web accessibility so part of that

00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:16,979
comes with with html5 and that wasn't

00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:19,260
something that was available for us to

00:04:16,979 --> 00:04:21,539
work with before it was a huge effort to

00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:24,720
go often to convert both the front end

00:04:21,539 --> 00:04:25,710
and the backhand into HTML 5 i'll be

00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,120
going into that in a bit more detail

00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:30,000
later

00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:32,370
another one is is a way area which is

00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,110
the web accessibility initiative of the

00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:38,790
World Wide Web consortiums that their

00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:42,660
area which is the the accessible rich

00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:45,060
Internet application so that suite of

00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:47,970
tools gives additional semantic

00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:49,830
information which can be useful largely

00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:51,090
the screen readers but not just a screen

00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:53,760
reader so there's a there's no

00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:56,639
opportunity to to use this this

00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:59,760
additional semantics to to give context

00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:03,449
and an information to people who are are

00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:05,250
building the the you're building

00:05:03,449 --> 00:05:08,970
websites and we've brought a lot of that

00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:12,150
in there Drupal's is also coming with

00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:13,380
the latest version of jQuery UI and when

00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:15,000
Drupal 8 comes out that would be

00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:16,669
something that that also has a number of

00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,440
accessibility improvements in there

00:05:16,669 --> 00:05:20,669
there's a great team at the jQuery

00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,260
community that is looking at

00:05:20,669 --> 00:05:24,900
accessibility issues and working to

00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:26,250
improve that that library and the Drupal

00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:28,260
community certainly being being at

00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:32,550
working with them to try to test and

00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:34,410
evaluate the the code base for that one

00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:37,650
of the things that made Drupal 7 so good

00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:42,000
was with the the forms API and that the

00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:43,530
forms API so so many of the the the

00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,860
elements for for creating and developing

00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:48,510
a web form and Ian Drupal's done through

00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:50,700
the centralized application programming

00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:52,889
interface that allows us to really have

00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:56,039
a lot of control about how forms are

00:05:52,889 --> 00:05:58,020
processed but we've updated that to give

00:05:56,039 --> 00:06:00,360
a lot more context and a lot more

00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:03,539
information which really helps with the

00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:07,169
the accessibility finally there's

00:06:03,539 --> 00:06:10,410
there's a number of CSS tools that are

00:06:07,169 --> 00:06:13,139
centralized tools for CSS and JavaScript

00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:14,729
that that you can that you can use when

00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:17,039
you're developing your modules and your

00:06:14,729 --> 00:06:20,479
themes that will make it easier for you

00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:23,190
to to convey in a systematic way

00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:25,470
information to to screen readers and to

00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:28,800
control how keyboard oil users are able

00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:31,919
to navigate your site so with that lower

00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:34,349
if you could go to the next slide so I a

00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:38,030
tag is is a new a new thing that's

00:06:34,349 --> 00:06:40,680
that's what we were striving for with

00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:46,500
w/e with with Drupal 7 and Drupal

00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:47,940
it is WK requirements which is if the WK

00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:51,800
is the the web content accessibility

00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:55,259
guidelines and a tag is part of the same

00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:58,650
suite of guidelines but they're looking

00:06:55,259 --> 00:07:01,639
for how to go up and create a creating

00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:03,960
offering interface that allows people to

00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:07,490
encourages people to create accessible

00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:10,110
content so making that the tool itself a

00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:12,419
better tool for authoring accessible

00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:15,599
content and dripless is responsible for

00:07:12,419 --> 00:07:17,310
both creating content as well as as

00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:19,320
displaying that content so it's really

00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:24,479
both an authoring tool at a presentation

00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:26,490
tool but but we've begun to go to be to

00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:28,919
incorporate elements of a tag which is a

00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:31,169
new candidate or since it's just as a

00:07:28,919 --> 00:07:35,360
candidate release phase of the World

00:07:31,169 --> 00:07:39,270
Wide Web Consortium but what this allows

00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:42,210
allows us to do is is really begin to to

00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:44,340
engage with with the the best practices

00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:48,409
of the the web accessibility community

00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:50,699
globally and trying and look at at

00:07:48,409 --> 00:07:52,650
implementing things that make it easier

00:07:50,699 --> 00:07:55,440
for for authors to create that

00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:58,560
accessible content so one of the things

00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:59,610
that we've done is just a well as I said

00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,289
go up and make sure that the

00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:04,919
administration interface is accessible

00:08:01,289 --> 00:08:07,800
we've always in Drupal 7 and 8 tried to

00:08:04,919 --> 00:08:09,780
to make sure that that the that a blind

00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:13,639
user or somebody who has it uses

00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:16,530
assistive technology can both install a

00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:18,419
Drupal site be able to do the

00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:20,159
administration of Drupal site edit the

00:08:18,419 --> 00:08:23,159
content around the Drupal site and also

00:08:20,159 --> 00:08:25,560
you obviously read the the the content

00:08:23,159 --> 00:08:27,930
of the Drupal site as well so it's

00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:30,180
really looking at the whole experience

00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:33,719
of both being a user and also a

00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:35,430
developer of the triple platform one of

00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:39,390
the nice things we've added in forever a

00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:42,000
tag is is requiring alt text so we want

00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:43,770
to try and encourage best practices

00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,320
wherever possible and one of the things

00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:48,120
we noticed after Drupal 7 was Drupal

00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,650
seasons release was that the most common

00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:52,380
accessibility errors that we ran into

00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:54,100
when people were watching a new website

00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:55,240
was that they forgot to use the

00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:57,160
alt text when you're uploading images

00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:59,319
and so there's a few places that will

00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:03,190
talk about that that where we've even

00:08:59,319 --> 00:09:05,380
included requirements for alt text and

00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:07,810
that that that helps with with getting

00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:10,540
this this with moving towards towards

00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:13,600
eight a compliance we've also added help

00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:15,790
documentation in line there are a game

00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,440
times where if you knew what to do you

00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:19,420
were able to go off and create something

00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,610
then an author was able to go off and

00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:24,310
create more accessible content but if

00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:26,589
you didn't have a an idea of what the

00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:28,360
content was capable of then it was

00:09:26,589 --> 00:09:30,399
really difficult or whether tool could

00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:32,019
do is difficult for authors to know

00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:35,470
where to begin and how to start creating

00:09:32,019 --> 00:09:37,630
that I did to adopt those accessibility

00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:39,430
best practices so by by trying to change

00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:41,230
the documentation we're making it easier

00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:48,730
for your editors to go off and create

00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:52,720
better content next slide so I mentioned

00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:54,610
html5 a bit earlier but but it's really

00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,889
about trying to build in more semantics

00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:58,360
to building more meaning so there's this

00:09:56,889 --> 00:10:02,170
things that we were able to go off and

00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:05,410
baked into to Drupal Drupal 8 like the

00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:07,449
the phone number field and email and URL

00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:11,680
and search and number and color there's

00:10:07,449 --> 00:10:15,819
there's a number of HTML tags or tags

00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:18,250
that we can now use in the the when

00:10:15,819 --> 00:10:23,139
we're building websites and that is part

00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:26,110
of the the vapi another big change that

00:10:23,139 --> 00:10:29,620
we made was with switching from field

00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:32,220
sets to details in in every previous

00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:34,329
version of Drupal there was a

00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:36,040
collapsible elements were done through

00:10:34,329 --> 00:10:38,850
fieldset switch which used to be an all

00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:41,709
right way to go off and two to manage

00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:44,259
create a segment of content that you

00:10:41,709 --> 00:10:45,790
want to be able to to New Hyde to

00:10:44,259 --> 00:10:49,420
minimize the amount of content on the

00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:51,250
screen unfortunately nested field sets

00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:54,699
don't work particularly well for

00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:57,699
assistive technology so it was a real

00:10:54,699 --> 00:11:01,899
barrier for trying to to use field sets

00:10:57,699 --> 00:11:04,569
properly in in Drupal 7 but with Drupal

00:11:01,899 --> 00:11:08,259
8 we've eliminated that problem and and

00:11:04,569 --> 00:11:12,339
it's easier now for radio buttons

00:11:08,259 --> 00:11:16,839
check boxes and and multi-part form

00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:18,429
elements to be wrapped in a field set so

00:11:16,839 --> 00:11:21,699
that there's that semantic relationship

00:11:18,429 --> 00:11:24,249
built within them but but again d to

00:11:21,699 --> 00:11:26,139
this is something that that was was new

00:11:24,249 --> 00:11:29,109
to Drupal but it but also many ways need

00:11:26,139 --> 00:11:31,479
to to web development and that the

00:11:29,109 --> 00:11:33,459
details tag is one that that when we

00:11:31,479 --> 00:11:36,429
first implemented implemented it wasn't

00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:42,759
as well supported because HTML is still

00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:43,899
in evolving the set of attributes did

00:11:42,759 --> 00:11:46,539
the final element I wanted to talk about

00:11:43,899 --> 00:11:50,499
under HTML was the the required element

00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:53,589
so we can now semantically go off and in

00:11:50,499 --> 00:11:57,569
the HTML explain when an input form is

00:11:53,589 --> 00:12:01,179
required this is it's really good for

00:11:57,569 --> 00:12:03,910
for accessibility particularly for users

00:12:01,179 --> 00:12:06,850
that might have javascript disabled so

00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:10,049
making sure that there's a way that

00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:12,459
universally without JavaScript you can I

00:12:10,049 --> 00:12:14,910
identified to a browser which are the

00:12:12,459 --> 00:12:19,509
elements that need to be be filled in

00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:21,399
now the we're going to be looking at at

00:12:19,509 --> 00:12:23,769
that going forward because there's a

00:12:21,399 --> 00:12:27,609
there's an outstanding issue to to try

00:12:23,769 --> 00:12:31,029
and take that that default HTML output

00:12:27,609 --> 00:12:33,429
and actually wrap the the JavaScript

00:12:31,029 --> 00:12:37,149
around that or drop wrap javascript

00:12:33,429 --> 00:12:39,660
around that so that you can have a nicer

00:12:37,149 --> 00:12:42,399
user interface that that provides more

00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:44,439
more usable information and work to get

00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:46,660
more excessively for users that have

00:12:44,439 --> 00:12:50,259
javascript enabled but but that's just

00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:52,869
the beginning point of that we haven't

00:12:50,259 --> 00:12:54,519
yet gone gone and and were able to bring

00:12:52,869 --> 00:12:57,879
we're not able to get find a solution

00:12:54,519 --> 00:13:01,480
that works for Drupal 8 just yet to wrap

00:12:57,879 --> 00:13:10,449
the the html5 required elements next

00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:12,399
slide please so area is this accessible

00:13:10,449 --> 00:13:14,589
rich Internet applications and we've

00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:16,749
we've added a few there's a few of them

00:13:14,589 --> 00:13:19,209
actually that are already in Drupal 7

00:13:16,749 --> 00:13:21,950
when you're in doing the initial

00:13:19,209 --> 00:13:26,210
installation areas is

00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:27,710
used to to announce when there are your

00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:29,870
progress as your as you're doing the

00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:31,880
announcements so if you wanted to to

00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:34,640
hear some of the initial implementations

00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:37,310
of area you could you could hear that in

00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:39,620
the installation screen to sort of here

00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:41,990
that the progress in in Drupal 8 you've

00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:44,030
added it in a lot of other places and we

00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:46,730
couldn't add it before because the area

00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:48,980
standard hadn't been being finalized it

00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:50,570
wasn't wasn't ready yet to go off and be

00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:53,140
baked into Drupal 7 but it's now

00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:55,540
something it was stable enough that that

00:13:53,140 --> 00:14:00,230
we were able to go off and bring that in

00:13:55,540 --> 00:14:03,170
and so area landmarks are added to both

00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:05,510
the core themes and core blocks and area

00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:08,180
landmarks are basically describing

00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:10,700
information and the kinds of content

00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:13,150
blocks or types of content that are

00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:16,130
around so it could be that there's a

00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:18,320
searches as a type of landmark and the

00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:21,430
footer is a type of man landmark and

00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:24,470
people are able to navigate through

00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:26,600
using a screen reader they can navigate

00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:27,950
through the website and find out

00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,390
semantically whether you're talking

00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:31,130
about a menu or whether you're talking

00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:33,950
about related content or whether thought

00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:36,320
this is the the mean the main element

00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:38,360
itself so it's really useful to present

00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:41,450
that information to to screen reader

00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:42,860
users so that they have that context we

00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:45,830
also there was initially a discussion

00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:47,690
about trying to take out the HTML the

00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:49,700
header elements because we also in a

00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:52,760
Drupal 7 introduced a number of header

00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:55,670
elements to allow people to navigate

00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:57,590
through the website and unfortunately at

00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:59,030
this stage we're not able to remove

00:14:57,590 --> 00:15:01,430
those those those has those header

00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:05,030
elements in a lot of cases those header

00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:06,950
elements are still being listed at least

00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:08,450
in Drupal 7 or listed as element

00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:09,800
invisible so you don't actually see them

00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:12,500
but they're there so that there's that

00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:15,980
semantic information presented on the

00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:18,170
page but but screen reader users use the

00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:20,180
landmarks and the heading structure

00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:24,260
differently to understand how a page is

00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:27,550
built into to navigate with that we've

00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:31,340
also used area described by to provide

00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:33,650
description of fields and and so if

00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:35,220
there's a if an input form has a

00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:36,689
description field

00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:39,089
that's all semantically linked so that

00:15:36,689 --> 00:15:40,769
you can that a screen reader user can

00:15:39,089 --> 00:15:42,089
under understand that there is a piece

00:15:40,769 --> 00:15:43,500
of related content and what a

00:15:42,089 --> 00:15:47,519
description field is tied to

00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:49,019
semantically also two core blocks are we

00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:51,089
talking about Ariel I've a little bit

00:15:49,019 --> 00:15:54,089
later so i won't go into more about that

00:15:51,089 --> 00:15:57,389
but it is essentially the to provide a

00:15:54,089 --> 00:15:58,889
way to interrupt the the user and and to

00:15:57,389 --> 00:16:00,269
make sure that if there's an urgent

00:15:58,889 --> 00:16:03,509
issue that needs to get passed to a

00:16:00,269 --> 00:16:04,889
screen reader user that they can be that

00:16:03,509 --> 00:16:07,560
they're what is being read to them can

00:16:04,889 --> 00:16:09,899
be interrupted we've also added area

00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:13,529
sort which which gives you the ability

00:16:09,899 --> 00:16:16,800
to convey when the when you're changing

00:16:13,529 --> 00:16:19,290
the sort order of a table and if you

00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:21,180
want to change the order of things this

00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:22,860
gives that information semantically to

00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:25,259
the browser or to the assistive

00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:31,910
technology so they can understand what

00:16:25,259 --> 00:16:35,040
is happening next slide please so I

00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:38,069
image support is is a is one of the

00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:40,500
low-hanging fruit of accessibility alt

00:16:38,069 --> 00:16:43,559
text in some ways are so simple and

00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:45,750
otherwise our are somewhat wealth are

00:16:43,559 --> 00:16:47,939
quite complicated it's difficult anessa

00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:51,000
to know how to describe an image and

00:16:47,939 --> 00:16:52,610
what are the the the best ways depending

00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,899
on the content that is presented with

00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:57,839
because sometimes a picture is something

00:16:54,899 --> 00:16:59,309
you may not want to actually just

00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:02,490
describe the picture you may want to

00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:05,120
describe what the picture says in the

00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:07,110
context of the text that is embedded in

00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:10,470
but we've made a number of big

00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:13,439
improvements to to the the Drupal

00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:15,780
interface with with Drupal 8 in that

00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:19,079
that alt text is required by default on

00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:23,309
content types so when you're setting up

00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:25,380
a new content type or are are using the

00:17:23,309 --> 00:17:28,140
default ones that come with Drupal they

00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:30,030
come already enabled with with alt text

00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:32,220
and having that alt text be required by

00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:34,320
default now this can be turned off so

00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:37,409
you don't have to go off and when you're

00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:40,080
creating new content types have required

00:17:37,409 --> 00:17:42,299
text for that but it's something that

00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:44,250
that establishes that default so it's

00:17:42,299 --> 00:17:46,649
it's if you're if you're just

00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:48,360
implementing the the best practice that

00:17:46,649 --> 00:17:48,809
will include all text if you for some

00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,340
reason

00:17:48,809 --> 00:17:52,649
don't want to use that you can just

00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:55,379
disable that as but it's that extra step

00:17:52,649 --> 00:17:56,820
that makes it easier to go off of the

00:17:55,379 --> 00:17:59,850
easiest thing to do is to implement

00:17:56,820 --> 00:18:02,840
something in an accessible manner with

00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:05,460
ckeditor there was also a an alt text

00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:08,610
that was was we're now requiring alt

00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:10,740
text by date by default there and you

00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:13,499
can disable that but it's a bit more

00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:15,960
complicated to disable the the alt text

00:18:13,499 --> 00:18:17,999
for images and seek editor and we did

00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:22,440
this because we couldn't find that many

00:18:17,999 --> 00:18:24,480
instances where where it would be well

00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:26,490
there's a there's a way to go off and

00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:28,950
disable them in the user interface on an

00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:31,679
individual basis but by default it will

00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:35,309
go off on you'll be forced to / / write

00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:37,649
that as your your your addy and as

00:18:35,309 --> 00:18:40,499
you're adding images in ckeditor by

00:18:37,649 --> 00:18:43,740
default the ckeditor is going to ask you

00:18:40,499 --> 00:18:46,649
for an alt text and and it's it's a it's

00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:48,720
something that for most instances when

00:18:46,649 --> 00:18:50,629
people are adding images unless you're

00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:54,509
you're really familiar with what are the

00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:57,029
the kinds of the the places where it's

00:18:54,509 --> 00:18:59,070
inappropriate to use alt text on images

00:18:57,029 --> 00:19:00,629
and there are a couple fringe cases

00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:02,309
where it's not where it's not

00:19:00,629 --> 00:19:07,139
appropriate to go often we use alt text

00:19:02,309 --> 00:19:09,119
like if it's a if it's only for the

00:19:07,139 --> 00:19:12,090
fervor decoration you don't need to

00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:15,029
include all text in that but it's it's

00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:19,649
we've tried to to to set it up so that

00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:22,139
it sits you're having the user is going

00:19:19,649 --> 00:19:25,559
to be encouraged to go off into to add

00:19:22,139 --> 00:19:27,059
alt text in places where it it worth for

00:19:25,559 --> 00:19:28,499
eighty or ninety percent of the tenth

00:19:27,059 --> 00:19:31,789
time you're going to want it to have

00:19:28,499 --> 00:19:34,950
that alt text there you'll also find in

00:19:31,789 --> 00:19:37,190
interpolate that there's longer text for

00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:40,230
all text and that is translatable

00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:42,990
there's also now support for the theme

00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:44,399
image function so that's that's

00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:51,259
something also we've we've added in

00:19:44,399 --> 00:19:54,419
there you can go to the next slide so

00:19:51,259 --> 00:19:58,379
use is is now in Drupal 8 and it's

00:19:54,419 --> 00:20:02,310
amazing but part of bringing views into

00:19:58,379 --> 00:20:04,170
Drupal 8 is is meant that the the

00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:06,510
both the user interface and the output

00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:09,090
have have met a higher requirements

00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:12,210
because contributed modules don't need

00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:15,150
to go off and to meet the the goals of

00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:16,740
WK two point O double-a standards but

00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:19,230
we're really hoping that everything in

00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:22,230
in core itself is is meeting those

00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:26,910
requirements so so we've had to do a lot

00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:29,550
of work to to add more semantics to to

00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:31,740
the user interface so that blind users

00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:34,260
can start to use vuze this hasn't been a

00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:37,230
it's been a major sticking point for for

00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:40,890
people who are using vuze in drupal 7

00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:42,120
right now so they basically yeah it's a

00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:46,770
real challenge to go often use it

00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:50,310
without without having a eat without

00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:54,330
either disabling JavaScript or or doing

00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:57,030
or being a sighted person so the

00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:59,670
improvements we've made there we've also

00:20:57,030 --> 00:21:03,210
made improvements on the output so the

00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:04,980
tables in particular have have made we

00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:08,040
have be made considerably more

00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:10,200
accessible there's now the ability to go

00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:12,360
off in the set caption and summary

00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:14,310
tables and the seberus terming elements

00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:16,970
there there's there's always changes in

00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:20,610
code and what is the best practices and

00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:22,740
in in HTML 4 there was a slightly

00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:25,230
different way to go off in the handle

00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:29,610
summary and caption elements then there

00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:31,650
is an inn in Drupal Drupal in html5

00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:33,660
rather because in html5 there's a yeah a

00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:35,940
slightly different best practice so

00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:40,560
we've adopted the the the more recent

00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:42,810
best practice we've also made sure to go

00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:45,090
off and include header and ID elements

00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:47,130
to improve the semantic information

00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:50,430
semantics in Korea a relationship

00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:52,170
between tables and it's not like most of

00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:54,600
the time the tables in Drupal are all

00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:56,310
that complicated and Indian some people

00:21:54,600 --> 00:22:02,460
have argued that they're not actually

00:21:56,310 --> 00:22:04,890
necessary to 244 for some for some

00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:09,690
screen reader users but they're being

00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:11,190
enough people who do use them or do just

00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:12,930
have them consistently implemented by

00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:14,790
views tables what will it will

00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:16,110
definitely make it easier for for

00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:18,660
machines of all sort to be able

00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:24,900
to identify where they are in the

00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:26,790
context of a of a data table views is

00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:28,830
also using a common modal dialogue which

00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:31,170
which helps to again for consistency

00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:33,420
make sure that that that they're using

00:22:31,170 --> 00:22:35,580
the true a default Drupal dialogue that

00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:43,890
is consistent across the board for for

00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:48,299
users next slide so forms API is is is

00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:50,309
great and web forms are our accessible

00:22:48,299 --> 00:22:53,490
web forms are really quite complicated

00:22:50,309 --> 00:22:55,320
but but we've simplified a lot of that

00:22:53,490 --> 00:23:01,080
for for most people and in part that's

00:22:55,320 --> 00:23:02,940
the introduction of area we need went

00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:04,770
off and how to add an issue with with

00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:08,280
the the asterisks and the star that

00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:09,720
appears on our required text and there's

00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:11,760
sometimes these little things that that

00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:14,010
depending on who is evaluating the

00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:16,020
website and how they're what they're

00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:20,160
they're looking for it has been a

00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:23,280
sticking point on on some some some user

00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:26,190
yes on some evaluations of Drupal 7 so

00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:29,419
we've been able to find what I think is

00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:32,340
a best practice for this and in terms of

00:23:29,419 --> 00:23:35,580
actually displaying the asterisks

00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:38,160
through CSS and using the asterisks as

00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:42,210
creating the asterisks as and st SVG

00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:44,100
file that that is is displayed in a in a

00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:46,340
really mobile friendly way so that

00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:48,929
expands really nicely and then blows up

00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:54,059
again and it looks really crisp at a

00:23:48,929 --> 00:23:55,799
large large size but it's it's it is

00:23:54,059 --> 00:23:57,900
also very accessible the way that we've

00:23:55,799 --> 00:24:00,630
created it it's a it's something that I

00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:03,169
think is a nice best practice moving

00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:05,370
forward in terms of presenting the

00:24:03,169 --> 00:24:06,960
presenting just the information that a

00:24:05,370 --> 00:24:12,679
screen reader user would need to see

00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:15,179
without providing a unrelated star

00:24:12,679 --> 00:24:18,090
usually us commuter was reading it out

00:24:15,179 --> 00:24:19,890
it's a star and when it's the required

00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:21,780
text and that's does it has been

00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:23,370
understood to be required because it's

00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:26,340
just a convention that's being adopted

00:24:23,370 --> 00:24:27,950
this it's much more orally

00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:31,429
understandable right now where it's

00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:33,980
clearly read out as required text we've

00:24:31,429 --> 00:24:36,710
also made the configuration of the

00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:38,529
description text configurable so that

00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:40,039
you can through the user interface

00:24:38,529 --> 00:24:43,669
starting out to the user interface

00:24:40,039 --> 00:24:45,470
through you have to code it but but it's

00:24:43,669 --> 00:24:46,730
possible to to determine whether the

00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:50,179
decision have the description field

00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:52,250
appear in different places we've also

00:24:50,179 --> 00:24:56,750
added title to all form elements so that

00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:59,120
the if that there's a label and a title

00:24:56,750 --> 00:25:00,769
after I labeled it having the title with

00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:02,630
form elements means that there's always

00:25:00,769 --> 00:25:05,240
going to be a label that's associated

00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:07,340
with that that form element to see that

00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:10,220
the there's a semantic relationship and

00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:12,220
we're not going to be having having for

00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:14,179
input forms that don't have any

00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:17,330
corresponding title with them to give

00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:19,279
give context for that field and again

00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:21,590
we're supporting html5 s required field

00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:25,090
and the big change that this actually

00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:28,639
happened this week is we've we've made a

00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:32,029
one of the epic issue Keys is making in

00:25:28,639 --> 00:25:34,519
line forms in line accessible forms for

00:25:32,029 --> 00:25:36,740
mirror so that when people are filling

00:25:34,519 --> 00:25:40,010
in a form if they receive an error that

00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:41,750
we now have a an accessible means to go

00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:44,929
off and to convey that information back

00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:47,090
to the user so that that the by default

00:25:44,929 --> 00:25:49,970
in Drupal 8 the results are going to be

00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:52,130
much easier for everyone to be able to

00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:54,350
understand where the problem is and how

00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:57,409
to go off and address that and they'll

00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:59,840
be a simple link provided that draws

00:25:57,409 --> 00:26:01,789
people down to the the the source of the

00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:04,760
error and allows them to be able to make

00:26:01,789 --> 00:26:07,960
that correction so that's a huge huge

00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:10,309
issue that I think is is one that that

00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:11,950
all Drupal 8 sites are going to be

00:26:10,309 --> 00:26:14,120
benefiting from and probably one of the

00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:16,899
the bigger accessibility improvements

00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:20,539
that people will be able to identify

00:26:16,899 --> 00:26:22,360
even as as sighted people when they're

00:26:20,539 --> 00:26:30,080
they're navigating through a website

00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:32,000
next slide so the when you're when

00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:35,149
you're logging into the the the

00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,200
authenticated side of a website there

00:26:35,149 --> 00:26:39,230
are a couple things that that were

00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:40,880
knowing not only for for people with

00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:42,260
disabilities but but it's

00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:44,900
actually with people doesn't cover these

00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:46,790
things like auto capitalization and auto

00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:49,460
correction on usernames and passwords

00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:52,400
these are things that that when you're

00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:54,970
filling in a form with a mobile device

00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:58,100
it can be really frustrating to see that

00:26:54,970 --> 00:26:59,450
we've also added color and description a

00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:02,330
better description to the password

00:26:59,450 --> 00:27:04,100
checker so that that that is more

00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:06,530
semantically meaningful when when people

00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:09,400
are filling in the form they can see

00:27:06,530 --> 00:27:13,130
clearly that they they have both a

00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:15,980
visual and an textual explanation about

00:27:13,130 --> 00:27:17,420
what the changes that's that's whether

00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:20,300
or not their password is good enough or

00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:22,700
not and there's certainly other

00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:24,560
improvements that we've made for the

00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:26,090
administration side of the website and

00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:30,220
the toolbars is certainly one that's

00:27:26,090 --> 00:27:33,640
gone through quite a lot of reviews and

00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:37,130
improvements to see that that there's a

00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:40,670
very modern and very accessible menu

00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:43,370
built into Drupal 8 to allow people to

00:27:40,670 --> 00:27:47,150
navigate through their their their

00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:54,170
website in that in a really clear and

00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:56,810
straightforward matter next slide so in

00:27:54,170 --> 00:27:58,940
one of the mammoth issues that we dealt

00:27:56,810 --> 00:28:04,040
dealt with in Drupal 7 was was dealing

00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:07,340
with CSS display none and there was a

00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:10,910
decision to go often to eliminate that

00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:14,780
or to change the phrasing of the CSS or

00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:17,450
in them in Drupal 7 we created element

00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:22,070
invisible and a element hidden we

00:28:17,450 --> 00:28:24,640
created our own sort of nomenclature 444

00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:28,550
how to go off and to to hide content on

00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:30,290
on websites and whether it's the the

00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:31,610
heading pages that i mentioned earlier

00:28:30,290 --> 00:28:34,070
that we wanted to have therefore

00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:37,250
semantic reasons but we didn't want to

00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:40,580
to have them we wanted to hide them for

00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:44,870
sighted users but not to hide them to

00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:46,460
screen readers or another one is the the

00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:48,890
Skip links that the skip links that are

00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:52,040
built into Drupal 7 we wanted to be able

00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:53,530
to to have them visible on focus but not

00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:56,080
see them at other times

00:28:53,530 --> 00:28:59,350
it was something that we felt it was it

00:28:56,080 --> 00:29:01,360
was it was a better it was useful to

00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:06,160
have a pattern built into Drupal 7 that

00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:09,580
allowed us to to to to have one standard

00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:14,050
way to be able to have an accessible way

00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:17,950
of hiding hiding content for for

00:29:14,050 --> 00:29:20,110
everyone for for screenreader users and

00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:22,090
also for for keyboard only users to make

00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:25,930
sure that there was a mechanism to do

00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:27,520
that in Drupal 8 we decided we looked

00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:29,530
outside of the community like we've done

00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:32,050
for a lot of the Drupal 8 process and

00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:34,960
decided that was it was better to adopt

00:29:32,050 --> 00:29:38,170
the the language the nomenclature that

00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:40,300
the html5 boilerplate did so in this

00:29:38,170 --> 00:29:42,370
case the language is hidden visually

00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:44,740
hidden visually hidden focus folks

00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:47,050
abandon visible there's really not much

00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:51,810
difference between hidden an invisible

00:29:47,050 --> 00:29:53,890
but the you're going to find that that

00:29:51,810 --> 00:29:56,560
then when you're doing your upgrades

00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:58,690
from Drupal 7 to Drupal 8 that there are

00:29:56,560 --> 00:30:01,090
going to be places where where the the

00:29:58,690 --> 00:30:03,880
old element and bill invisible classes

00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:07,030
will need to be renamed to be the the

00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:10,510
new the new format using hidden or

00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:13,870
visually hidden to to to make sure that

00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:16,180
that that it's clear when when when

00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:17,350
people are using the new standard

00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:19,000
because we're not going to be the

00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:22,500
element invisible classes are no longer

00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:26,050
part of the of the Drupal 8 framework

00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:28,870
we've also in in the in the UI there's

00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:32,140
the ability to you're creating a field

00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:34,620
label for matter to actually determine

00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:37,300
whether or not that field label is

00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:40,000
visually hidden or not so there's others

00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:43,840
a I drop-down that allows you to to

00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:45,370
specify that so that that's made it a

00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:48,370
lot more useful for people who are

00:30:45,370 --> 00:30:49,960
creating content types and wanting to be

00:30:48,370 --> 00:30:54,210
able to control how that that

00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:54,210
information is presented next slide

00:30:56,010 --> 00:31:02,170
another big change that we've we've

00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:04,990
added is around the the JavaScript and

00:31:02,170 --> 00:31:05,770
the the tabbing manager is is something

00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:08,950
that

00:31:05,770 --> 00:31:12,400
that wim largely developed and in this

00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:14,500
case it's it's allowing people to or

00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:16,990
trying to go off and dealing with more

00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:20,200
complicated user interfaces and with

00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:22,570
more more complicated user interfaces

00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:25,560
you need to be able to to control the

00:31:22,570 --> 00:31:30,610
tabbing structure in a way that allows

00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:34,900
allows it to to function like in it gets

00:31:30,610 --> 00:31:37,510
an isolated piece like in terms of the

00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:39,850
the if you if you have a list of links

00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:41,500
that pops up you may want to be able to

00:31:39,850 --> 00:31:44,350
to tab through that list of links and

00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:47,560
then go up to the top of that set of

00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:50,620
links and cycle through that until that

00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:52,740
that set of links is released and I

00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:56,110
provided some code to go off an end to

00:31:52,740 --> 00:32:00,120
to address this and there's there's

00:31:56,110 --> 00:32:03,610
already there's also examples in the Uni

00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:07,050
in Drupal 8 about how to how to go off

00:32:03,610 --> 00:32:09,690
into manage the at the tabbing manager

00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:12,750
so and this is a game this is a

00:32:09,690 --> 00:32:17,140
JavaScript function that allows you to

00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:23,550
to control the the function for for for

00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:26,470
keyboard only users so next slide please

00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:29,890
I should also just say that that just in

00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:31,390
case people don't know people there's a

00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:33,970
number of people who use keyboards to

00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:35,530
navigate there's a certain people who

00:32:33,970 --> 00:32:37,990
might have carpal tunnel syndrome or

00:32:35,530 --> 00:32:40,900
might have something like cerebral palsy

00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:43,690
who are not able to navigate through a

00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:45,520
website using the mouse but certainly

00:32:43,690 --> 00:32:48,670
people who are blind as well our

00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:51,580
keyboard only users there's those people

00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:54,280
have much more limited movement who also

00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:57,280
navigate by essentially tabbing through

00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:59,080
a list of links and navigating by

00:32:57,280 --> 00:33:00,670
jumping between links on the page and

00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:02,290
that's what I was referring to earlier

00:33:00,670 --> 00:33:05,320
on the previous slide about tabbing

00:33:02,290 --> 00:33:06,910
through the interface the the next

00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:10,480
JavaScript tool that we've we've added

00:33:06,910 --> 00:33:14,110
is is Drupal announced and this is using

00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:15,700
the area live functionality to be able

00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:18,040
to communicate directly to the screen

00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:20,039
reader to give them information about

00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:21,999
what it is

00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:25,960
important information that might need to

00:33:21,999 --> 00:33:28,210
get past alone so this is a there's an

00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:29,889
example of this but we're really hoping

00:33:28,210 --> 00:33:32,139
that when there's there's interruptions

00:33:29,889 --> 00:33:34,899
or our announcements that are being made

00:33:32,139 --> 00:33:36,639
to a sighted user when there's content

00:33:34,899 --> 00:33:39,759
that changes on the screen that this

00:33:36,639 --> 00:33:41,080
content can get reported back to the to

00:33:39,759 --> 00:33:42,759
the screen reader to let them know that

00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:46,720
there is new or different content on the

00:33:42,759 --> 00:33:49,590
web page it's it's something that that

00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:53,440
when we're we're we're creating a

00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:55,479
creating information on a website so

00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:57,970
many of the web pages are now so dynamic

00:33:55,479 --> 00:34:00,519
that that the content is being changed

00:33:57,970 --> 00:34:03,549
as we navigate through it and providing

00:34:00,519 --> 00:34:05,830
a means to accede to explain to a screen

00:34:03,549 --> 00:34:07,869
reader that that there is a change they

00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:09,940
might need to go off and and review the

00:34:07,869 --> 00:34:12,549
content on the page because of that of

00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:15,490
an update it's really quite important to

00:34:12,549 --> 00:34:17,950
have that that context and give that to

00:34:15,490 --> 00:34:22,119
them and again there's in the middle of

00:34:17,950 --> 00:34:23,889
that slide of a provider d the annex an

00:34:22,119 --> 00:34:28,329
example of how to go often to use the

00:34:23,889 --> 00:34:30,250
the drupal announced function and a game

00:34:28,329 --> 00:34:32,440
Drupal's a there's been a real effort to

00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:36,339
try and make a Drupal multilingual and

00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:38,740
and so in this case in Drupal 8 is

00:34:36,339 --> 00:34:41,470
definitely the most multilingual version

00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:44,529
of Drupal at Drupal ever but the example

00:34:41,470 --> 00:34:47,980
we've used here includes translation as

00:34:44,529 --> 00:34:49,659
well now I didn't actually include a

00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:51,819
slide on this than since I'm talking a

00:34:49,659 --> 00:34:54,149
little bit about about translation it is

00:34:51,819 --> 00:34:55,929
useful to remember that there are

00:34:54,149 --> 00:34:57,700
accessibility implications for

00:34:55,929 --> 00:35:01,599
multilingual sites and multilingual

00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:03,579
content if you are using different a

00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:07,480
different language within the context of

00:35:03,579 --> 00:35:09,069
a of a page the the the screen reader

00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:11,650
needs to be alerted about that and

00:35:09,069 --> 00:35:15,789
there's there's easy ways to go off into

00:35:11,650 --> 00:35:17,440
either within a span tag or within at

00:35:15,789 --> 00:35:20,200
the header of the page to go and

00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:23,380
identify what is the language that's

00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:25,210
that's being used but it's it's a it's

00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:27,730
it's it's so important because the

00:35:25,210 --> 00:35:29,619
screen readers just try to read the

00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:31,150
content out using the library's that

00:35:29,619 --> 00:35:32,190
they have available and they could go

00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:33,990
off and if

00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:35,579
you if you gave it gave them the

00:35:33,990 --> 00:35:37,589
instruction that the text was in a

00:35:35,579 --> 00:35:40,440
different language it would try to to

00:35:37,589 --> 00:35:42,420
read it in that other language but

00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:48,079
that's that's a fairly short description

00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:50,940
of that if we go to the next slide so

00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:53,480
another neat initiative in in Drupal 8

00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:56,130
is the the proudly built elsewhere and

00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:58,650
dribbles really work to try and play

00:35:56,130 --> 00:36:01,589
well with others and to collaborate and

00:35:58,650 --> 00:36:04,589
really engage with with other open

00:36:01,589 --> 00:36:07,730
source communities to try and build the

00:36:04,589 --> 00:36:10,410
best the best tools out there and so

00:36:07,730 --> 00:36:12,390
you'll you'll hear more interplay about

00:36:10,410 --> 00:36:15,349
the use of twig in the use of symphony

00:36:12,390 --> 00:36:17,880
and those are our elements that that

00:36:15,349 --> 00:36:19,410
that don't really have an accessibility

00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:22,079
component to them because they're

00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:24,329
they're deeper than that they're know

00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:26,849
the structure of the HTML not the HTML

00:36:24,329 --> 00:36:29,460
RZ it's is how the HTML is created as

00:36:26,849 --> 00:36:33,260
opposed to the HTML itself or how the

00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:35,970
page content is created but it's it's a

00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:38,220
where where there are elements where

00:36:35,970 --> 00:36:39,510
where the Drupal community has worked

00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:43,050
what worked hard and I had mentioned

00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:45,349
jQuery UI before seeking editors another

00:36:43,050 --> 00:36:49,770
interesting when there's a lot of

00:36:45,349 --> 00:36:52,920
discussion early on about which which

00:36:49,770 --> 00:36:54,390
wheezing week was was was Drupal 8 going

00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:56,640
to use and how are we going to ship with

00:36:54,390 --> 00:37:01,290
the WYSIWYG to be able to take advantage

00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:03,150
of all of the the the possibilities if

00:37:01,290 --> 00:37:04,890
you are able to have to control the

00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:06,300
WYSIWYG within that interface and and

00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:08,550
make sure that the information is

00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:09,869
properly synced up it it just makes the

00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:13,530
user experience so much more

00:37:09,869 --> 00:37:16,740
professional but but we really worked

00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:18,930
with the bcq editor community to push

00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:21,420
their accessibility to improve it but

00:37:18,930 --> 00:37:24,180
also to to make sure that it worked well

00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:26,040
within the Drupal context and seek the

00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:28,069
secatur communities worked long and

00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:29,970
improving their their their

00:37:28,069 --> 00:37:32,040
accessibility and they've done a great

00:37:29,970 --> 00:37:35,550
job of it but it's it's something that

00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:37,950
does require perpetual vigilance because

00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:40,829
because the whole environment is

00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:42,990
changing all the time you have this is

00:37:40,829 --> 00:37:45,540
the the browser's are being updated user

00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:49,320
expectations are changing

00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:52,380
the the markup is changing as well so

00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:54,660
many things are being being reworked as

00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:56,820
we go and it's it's a it's really

00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:58,710
important to be working with a large a

00:37:56,820 --> 00:38:01,170
large community to try and make sure

00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:04,160
that that the tools we use are following

00:38:01,170 --> 00:38:07,080
with the best best practices out there

00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:10,050
so again we mention html5 boilerplate

00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:11,970
and you know trying to go off an end to

00:38:10,050 --> 00:38:14,940
pick from those those best best use

00:38:11,970 --> 00:38:17,720
cases I mentioned CSS lint in here as

00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:20,250
well CSS lint isn't there are

00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:24,210
instructions being included in Drupal 8

00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:27,930
to use CSS lint but it's it's a it's not

00:38:24,210 --> 00:38:29,280
like that libraries being included in in

00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:31,260
core itself but it's part of the

00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:33,090
development process that we're using now

00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:34,980
to try and make sure that the CSS in

00:38:33,090 --> 00:38:38,550
core is really shift as cleanly as

00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:40,710
possible and there's now tools and CSS

00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:42,930
lint thanks to working with the Drupal

00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:46,950
community that that are looking to see

00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:50,340
that the the focus and and hover effects

00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:53,310
for CSS are mirrored to alert developers

00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:55,680
when there's a problem when when the the

00:38:53,310 --> 00:38:58,620
the user is only looking or it doesn't

00:38:55,680 --> 00:39:05,570
include the the pairing the hover and

00:38:58,620 --> 00:39:08,610
focus elements for CSS next slide so

00:39:05,570 --> 00:39:11,430
there's a lot better markup in injured

00:39:08,610 --> 00:39:14,210
blade we've had a team of people who've

00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:16,170
been looking a tad clean up and

00:39:14,210 --> 00:39:19,830
eliminating divs and making sure that

00:39:16,170 --> 00:39:24,000
it's a much nicer interface to be able

00:39:19,830 --> 00:39:26,430
to just a theme to control but part of

00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:29,070
that that cleaner markup is that we have

00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:31,950
more meaningful HTML and so it's it's

00:39:29,070 --> 00:39:33,870
easier for screen readers to be able to

00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:36,000
navigate through pagination through

00:39:33,870 --> 00:39:38,690
breadcrumbs they're being improvements

00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:42,240
to the the book module to the forums

00:39:38,690 --> 00:39:44,370
there's also being improvements in

00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:46,500
taxonomy Xand and also sort of clean

00:39:44,370 --> 00:39:49,500
cleaned out croft like empty headings

00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:51,300
and labels that were in appropriately

00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:55,580
labeled and so that was the things we've

00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:55,580
done to clean that up next slide

00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:03,000
you also notice a bar trick that we

00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:05,160
there's underlines in the content of the

00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,660
links in the content itself and its

00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:08,730
really a best practice that we're trying

00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:11,580
to go off into to emphasize and

00:40:08,730 --> 00:40:14,550
reinforce is to make sure that that that

00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:17,100
the there are underlines and links to

00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:19,860
make sure that that that common commonly

00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:24,120
understood convention is is used by

00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:25,860
default in themes so that that we can we

00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:27,960
can move forward and answer to have that

00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:28,950
as a best practice moving ahead when

00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:31,650
people are thinking about designing

00:40:28,950 --> 00:40:33,840
their own themes so do try and keep in

00:40:31,650 --> 00:40:35,130
those those underline links and we the

00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:37,020
way we've done that does make it look a

00:40:35,130 --> 00:40:40,650
little bit better and a little bit more

00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:42,530
readable than then the default default

00:40:40,650 --> 00:40:48,810
ones that are presented with a browser

00:40:42,530 --> 00:40:51,720
next slide so color contrast is one that

00:40:48,810 --> 00:40:54,780
has as been an interesting one because

00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:57,630
it's often overlooked and with so much

00:40:54,780 --> 00:41:01,140
of our population ageing with the the

00:40:57,630 --> 00:41:03,120
baby boomers it's a bigger issue to try

00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:05,970
and make sure that people with low

00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:08,130
vision or people with different kinds of

00:41:05,970 --> 00:41:10,860
vision are able to go off and to see the

00:41:08,130 --> 00:41:12,660
the pages as well as possible so they're

00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:14,580
being places where we've noticed

00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:17,310
improvements that can be made with with

00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:21,140
gradients and and are watching how

00:41:17,310 --> 00:41:23,310
gradients are our calculator are

00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:25,380
evaluated when we're looking at the

00:41:23,310 --> 00:41:27,720
creation of core we've also made

00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:29,550
improvements to error messages and to

00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:32,850
just even though the gray text to make

00:41:29,550 --> 00:41:34,130
sure that that that that content is is

00:41:32,850 --> 00:41:36,390
something that's going to be available

00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:37,740
we also changed you'll notice that bar

00:41:36,390 --> 00:41:40,470
trick has a little bit of a different

00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:42,450
blue than it does in interval eight and

00:41:40,470 --> 00:41:44,730
Drupal 7 and again we wanted to make

00:41:42,450 --> 00:41:46,410
sure that that not only could you could

00:41:44,730 --> 00:41:48,450
something with low visions see this

00:41:46,410 --> 00:41:50,870
fairly well but that it would be easier

00:41:48,450 --> 00:41:54,660
when we're out using our iphones or our

00:41:50,870 --> 00:41:56,280
tablets out in the sun and needing to

00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:58,830
make small changes or whatnot to a

00:41:56,280 --> 00:42:01,530
website that we can we can do that

00:41:58,830 --> 00:42:03,750
because we have the ability we have the

00:42:01,530 --> 00:42:06,540
contrast to be able to see not just in a

00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:08,640
dark room with our bright bright screens

00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:10,560
but in in a real-life environment

00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:12,900
outdoors in the sunshine

00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:15,300
and that color car justice is becoming

00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:17,790
an important part particularly as Drupal

00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:18,720
8 has has a mobile-friendly focus and

00:42:17,790 --> 00:42:23,240
I'm going to make sure that

00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:23,240
accessibility is part of that next slide

00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:31,380
so this is where I mentioned the

00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:33,390
keyboard only focus and CSS lint and it

00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:35,130
is really important to keep an eye on on

00:42:33,390 --> 00:42:37,110
the focus of the keyboard so many times

00:42:35,130 --> 00:42:39,180
when people are doing the CSS they

00:42:37,110 --> 00:42:42,810
forget about the focus element and only

00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:44,190
look at hover whenever you have a hover

00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:46,230
effect to find there should be a

00:42:44,190 --> 00:42:49,680
corresponding focus event so that a

00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:51,930
keyboard only user has as good or better

00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:53,580
ability to go often to see where they

00:42:51,930 --> 00:42:55,290
are on the page because because really

00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:56,940
the focus element and the outline are

00:42:55,290 --> 00:43:00,330
really the only ways to go off make sure

00:42:56,940 --> 00:43:02,160
that that you have that a screen that I

00:43:00,330 --> 00:43:04,070
sorry that a keyboard only user who's

00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:06,510
cited knows where they are on the page

00:43:04,070 --> 00:43:08,460
and when you're you're testing your

00:43:06,510 --> 00:43:10,320
modules and themes it's useful to try

00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:12,450
and tab through the interface so just

00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:15,270
hit the tab key watch where the focus

00:43:12,450 --> 00:43:17,760
goes and and sort of see how how so many

00:43:15,270 --> 00:43:24,440
people are navigating your website

00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:27,500
without the use of a mouse next slide so

00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:30,360
there's a drip late isn't finished yet

00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:35,010
we all want to be to have out the door

00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:36,990
and and get running but it's not it's

00:43:35,010 --> 00:43:40,140
not done and there's a lot of issues

00:43:36,990 --> 00:43:44,100
that we know about that are being pushed

00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:45,960
back to to Drupal 8.1 because we've now

00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:48,960
have a new release cycle so that there

00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:50,400
will be point releases of Drupal or even

00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:52,350
to Drupal nine because they're just

00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:54,030
large enough issues that in order to

00:43:52,350 --> 00:43:58,430
tackle them we don't think we can tackle

00:43:54,030 --> 00:44:02,040
them without within the the 8.1 8.2

00:43:58,430 --> 00:44:04,080
release cycle for for drupal but there's

00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:07,110
still things that can get into the the

00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:08,850
the eight point 0 release and there's a

00:44:07,110 --> 00:44:11,310
list of issues a lot of them leave

00:44:08,850 --> 00:44:14,880
review a lot of the need the ability to

00:44:11,310 --> 00:44:16,440
to to test and evaluate and and you

00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:18,000
don't have to be an expert in order to

00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:21,660
do this there's lots of ways for people

00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:23,340
who are we have some experience to get

00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:24,880
involved in inta to look at that so

00:44:23,340 --> 00:44:29,410
they've included the

00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:32,200
that the URL to get to probably the best

00:44:29,410 --> 00:44:38,070
the best source of accessibility issues

00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:43,240
in in Drupal 8 and it's a goog l / one

00:44:38,070 --> 00:44:47,970
lower case B 1 lowercase J uppercase M

00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:52,960
lowercase B so do take a look at that

00:44:47,970 --> 00:44:55,570
the it's also there's if you run into

00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:57,670
issues it's important to post those

00:44:55,570 --> 00:44:59,440
those those issues or concerns to the

00:44:57,670 --> 00:45:01,480
issue queue that's the only way that

00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:03,940
that issues get addressed in the

00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:06,670
community and that goes for four modules

00:45:03,940 --> 00:45:09,130
and themes as well and as modules are

00:45:06,670 --> 00:45:11,650
being rewritten for Drupal 8 this is a

00:45:09,130 --> 00:45:14,020
great time for people who are using

00:45:11,650 --> 00:45:16,900
Drupal 7 to look ahead to say well this

00:45:14,020 --> 00:45:18,250
didn't quite work in in Drupal 7 we

00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:20,470
weren't able to go off and address the

00:45:18,250 --> 00:45:21,850
accessibility issues let's try and do

00:45:20,470 --> 00:45:23,950
this when we're rebuilding it for Drupal

00:45:21,850 --> 00:45:26,230
8 and look at how we can go off and and

00:45:23,950 --> 00:45:27,640
leverage what's in court to go off and

00:45:26,230 --> 00:45:31,950
make it easier for everyone to be able

00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:35,410
to access it there's also in the last

00:45:31,950 --> 00:45:36,910
last year to being some some really

00:45:35,410 --> 00:45:40,090
interesting tools that have come out

00:45:36,910 --> 00:45:42,730
that are either open source or open

00:45:40,090 --> 00:45:45,010
source friendly that that can be very

00:45:42,730 --> 00:45:48,010
very useful to test and evaluate your

00:45:45,010 --> 00:45:50,170
module or theme where order to look at a

00:45:48,010 --> 00:45:51,850
group of core itself the one that's

00:45:50,170 --> 00:45:55,930
that's best on the community is quail

00:45:51,850 --> 00:45:59,500
and it's a it's a great library that's

00:45:55,930 --> 00:46:02,070
got a lot of advantages to it but the

00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:05,590
the two that have come out recently is

00:46:02,070 --> 00:46:06,910
tenon which called groves is behind and

00:46:05,590 --> 00:46:09,100
making that's a JavaScript testing

00:46:06,910 --> 00:46:11,050
language or library but it's it's a it's

00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:13,360
a it's a service so in that case you

00:46:11,050 --> 00:46:16,050
have to actually pay or sign up to go

00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:18,670
often to get the results of that and

00:46:16,050 --> 00:46:21,670
there's a program sorry there's a

00:46:18,670 --> 00:46:24,250
organization called DQ that has created

00:46:21,670 --> 00:46:26,140
one called axe core that they've they'll

00:46:24,250 --> 00:46:28,900
all in the last couple weeks released

00:46:26,140 --> 00:46:32,020
and be interesting to see people try and

00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:34,660
evaluate and entities to test with these

00:46:32,020 --> 00:46:36,340
these open source well certainly the

00:46:34,660 --> 00:46:39,000
XCore and quail jsr open source

00:46:36,340 --> 00:46:42,340
libraries but to work with those

00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:44,620
but yeah reviewing core patches into to

00:46:42,340 --> 00:46:47,140
participate in in the the community

00:46:44,620 --> 00:46:48,430
online is really quite useful there's

00:46:47,140 --> 00:46:50,740
also going to be a number of

00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:53,830
opportunities to to learn it to read

00:46:50,740 --> 00:46:56,620
about web accessibility into too low to

00:46:53,830 --> 00:46:58,870
to learn about ways to go off and

00:46:56,620 --> 00:47:01,710
implement Drupal sites as as as well as

00:46:58,870 --> 00:47:05,140
you can there's a number of Drupal of

00:47:01,710 --> 00:47:08,400
accessibility camps that are that happen

00:47:05,140 --> 00:47:10,840
across North America and Asia as well

00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:13,570
that are worthwhile looking at there

00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:17,650
should be a few in the fall in probably

00:47:13,570 --> 00:47:19,030
in boston and DC and Toronto and Los

00:47:17,650 --> 00:47:22,960
Angeles so they happened in a few

00:47:19,030 --> 00:47:24,700
different places and it's a meeting with

00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:28,950
people with disabilities and talking

00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:31,180
with others and engaging with with the

00:47:28,950 --> 00:47:33,130
accessibility community online is a

00:47:31,180 --> 00:47:36,250
really great way to to help keep

00:47:33,130 --> 00:47:38,140
yourself up to up to date there's so

00:47:36,250 --> 00:47:40,870
much information which has been posted

00:47:38,140 --> 00:47:44,050
about web accessibility over the last 15

00:47:40,870 --> 00:47:45,910
years it's it's a it's difficult to keep

00:47:44,050 --> 00:47:47,590
up to date because there's so many times

00:47:45,910 --> 00:47:49,990
you've just you're doing with a google

00:47:47,590 --> 00:47:51,670
search you get a result back which isn't

00:47:49,990 --> 00:47:55,050
necessarily as current as you need it to

00:47:51,670 --> 00:47:58,750
be in order to to keep up with with the

00:47:55,050 --> 00:48:06,790
the best practices in for for for this

00:47:58,750 --> 00:48:10,050
day and age and next slide so this is

00:48:06,790 --> 00:48:12,370
our question-and-answer slide so if

00:48:10,050 --> 00:48:15,160
there's an opportunity for people to ask

00:48:12,370 --> 00:48:18,130
questions earlier and at this point

00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:21,190
nobody has has has asked a question in

00:48:18,130 --> 00:48:23,740
the window but lowering it a gym a

00:48:21,190 --> 00:48:28,930
question for me yeah I did just one

00:48:23,740 --> 00:48:31,540
second no problem you'll be handy if you

00:48:28,930 --> 00:48:33,790
had the use of the monitor you were

00:48:31,540 --> 00:48:37,750
expecting to have this yeah no I

00:48:33,790 --> 00:48:42,160
appreciate your patience call that so

00:48:37,750 --> 00:48:44,530
did you have a really quick question who

00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:48,130
other than blind users will benefit from

00:48:44,530 --> 00:48:51,460
these changes there are so many people

00:48:48,130 --> 00:48:52,570
who have accessibility issues either

00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:55,480
either temporary

00:48:52,570 --> 00:48:58,390
or permanently that that will benefit

00:48:55,480 --> 00:49:00,670
from from these changes that the blind

00:48:58,390 --> 00:49:07,840
community is really a minuscule portion

00:49:00,670 --> 00:49:08,950
of the population there are yeah there's

00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:11,890
there's there's people who have low

00:49:08,950 --> 00:49:13,840
vision whether it's seniors there's just

00:49:11,890 --> 00:49:17,380
even looking at the percentage of the

00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:18,550
male population at that is colorblind I

00:49:17,380 --> 00:49:20,200
think it's about seven percent of the

00:49:18,550 --> 00:49:23,140
male population in some form of

00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:26,290
colorblindness then there's the rest of

00:49:23,140 --> 00:49:28,600
us which just care less about color but

00:49:26,290 --> 00:49:32,770
but the percentage of colorblindness is

00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:34,660
is a within Menace is is significant you

00:49:32,770 --> 00:49:36,910
also have people were temporarily blind

00:49:34,660 --> 00:49:39,190
whether it's be our territory not

00:49:36,910 --> 00:49:41,950
temporal yeah temporarily blind or have

00:49:39,190 --> 00:49:45,130
those people who have lost some of their

00:49:41,950 --> 00:49:47,830
vision temporarily based on medications

00:49:45,130 --> 00:49:50,560
they're taking or based on an accident

00:49:47,830 --> 00:49:54,040
they might have had or even if you're if

00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:56,410
you're dealing with having cataracts

00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:59,050
removed or something like that that that

00:49:56,410 --> 00:50:01,180
you need to to deal with your glasses

00:49:59,050 --> 00:50:03,100
get broken in here at your without

00:50:01,180 --> 00:50:06,310
without your glasses for a period of

00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:08,230
time there's a lot of the improvements

00:50:06,310 --> 00:50:10,930
that we're making in here make it easier

00:50:08,230 --> 00:50:14,680
for for everyone to be able to adjust

00:50:10,930 --> 00:50:18,370
their just the web to to what their

00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:20,590
needs are at the moment and so it sits

00:50:18,370 --> 00:50:24,160
at least fifteen to twenty percent of

00:50:20,590 --> 00:50:26,380
the population that that is is is

00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:29,050
benefiting from some of these

00:50:26,380 --> 00:50:30,910
improvements because it's because of the

00:50:29,050 --> 00:50:35,740
range of issues that we've been tackling

00:50:30,910 --> 00:50:39,010
with this definitely um you mentioned uh

00:50:35,740 --> 00:50:42,760
eighty AG but is that a requirement for

00:50:39,010 --> 00:50:46,660
this a tag is is is not a requirement

00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:49,960
it's something that we've wanted to try

00:50:46,660 --> 00:50:51,580
and use in order to help authors create

00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:53,830
better content and more accessible

00:50:51,580 --> 00:50:55,830
content but that isn't something that

00:50:53,830 --> 00:50:59,740
we've that the Drupal community has

00:50:55,830 --> 00:51:03,040
endorsed and probably is that the that

00:50:59,740 --> 00:51:04,900
it's it's new and fresh enough that that

00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:08,200
the standards

00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:10,270
alright haven't quite haven't quite

00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:12,520
being been adopted and there are good

00:51:10,270 --> 00:51:15,820
models to go off into to implement this

00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:19,150
just yet so we need to have a few more

00:51:15,820 --> 00:51:22,660
examples in the community of how to to

00:51:19,150 --> 00:51:24,160
engage with with these guidelines it's

00:51:22,660 --> 00:51:27,970
it's something that I expect will be a

00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:31,120
bigger part of the experience for for

00:51:27,970 --> 00:51:34,060
Drupal knowing particularly as more

00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:36,660
agencies begin to to look for this and

00:51:34,060 --> 00:51:39,850
and certainly governments and

00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:42,040
universities have have led the efforts

00:51:39,850 --> 00:51:45,010
for for adoption of excessive the

00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:47,590
accessible standards and I'm assuming

00:51:45,010 --> 00:51:50,050
that this will happen in the next in the

00:51:47,590 --> 00:51:53,260
next year or two there'll be a greater a

00:51:50,050 --> 00:51:55,930
greater institutional push for for for

00:51:53,260 --> 00:51:58,030
these offering tools to to to be built

00:51:55,930 --> 00:52:01,060
in a way that it encourages accessible

00:51:58,030 --> 00:52:04,120
content to be written okay it looks like

00:52:01,060 --> 00:52:07,090
we do have a couple questions I'll just

00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:08,830
start with this one in Drupal 7 I ran

00:52:07,090 --> 00:52:12,010
into accessibility issues with a file

00:52:08,830 --> 00:52:14,320
attachment tab tables I can alt-text

00:52:12,010 --> 00:52:17,260
sticky header etc will that be addressed

00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:21,460
in a Drupal 8 we have made improvements

00:52:17,260 --> 00:52:24,100
to the file handling of Drupal 7 and

00:52:21,460 --> 00:52:26,410
that's this private it hasn't been

00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:28,750
completely resolved but it will

00:52:26,410 --> 00:52:33,460
certainly you'll be alerted when that

00:52:28,750 --> 00:52:35,890
file is is is uploaded to the page and

00:52:33,460 --> 00:52:38,590
and absolutely that was a problem that

00:52:35,890 --> 00:52:41,950
was we weren't able to address in in

00:52:38,590 --> 00:52:44,770
Drupal 7 and and it's a game these these

00:52:41,950 --> 00:52:48,040
issues where where as you upload an

00:52:44,770 --> 00:52:50,800
attachment to to a web page that the

00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:52,780
content of the content of the web page

00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:55,480
changed and in Drupal 7 we didn't have a

00:52:52,780 --> 00:52:57,970
way to announce to the user that there

00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:59,440
was a change to the page thankfully with

00:52:57,970 --> 00:53:03,190
Drupal announced we now have a mechanism

00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:06,270
to go out from two to provide that that

00:53:03,190 --> 00:53:08,860
additional context and we have a

00:53:06,270 --> 00:53:11,260
consistent standard that that that we

00:53:08,860 --> 00:53:12,940
can use to to convey that change of

00:53:11,260 --> 00:53:14,090
information whether a file is added or

00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:15,980
removed

00:53:14,090 --> 00:53:19,120
and.and to make sure that that's that's

00:53:15,980 --> 00:53:21,830
I clearly analysis for looters

00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:23,450
absolutely you mentioned color contrast

00:53:21,830 --> 00:53:25,460
as a new feature that comes with your

00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:27,410
plate is that a part of the things that

00:53:25,460 --> 00:53:30,440
come by default or do you need to add

00:53:27,410 --> 00:53:32,930
them individually the color contrast is

00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:34,460
mostly in how Bartok and seven or

00:53:32,930 --> 00:53:39,230
structures so it's mostly the theme

00:53:34,460 --> 00:53:41,150
layer but but the one of the great

00:53:39,230 --> 00:53:42,860
things about about Drupal is is that

00:53:41,150 --> 00:53:45,380
people look at core and they look at

00:53:42,860 --> 00:53:46,670
what is being done at core and they when

00:53:45,380 --> 00:53:49,430
they're building their own themes and

00:53:46,670 --> 00:53:52,850
modules tend to emulate what was done in

00:53:49,430 --> 00:53:55,370
core so if we've built it in with with a

00:53:52,850 --> 00:54:00,140
slightly different change of the CSS and

00:53:55,370 --> 00:54:01,640
we've we've incorporated a like the the

00:54:00,140 --> 00:54:06,800
color of the red that we've implemented

00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:09,500
in in for for the asteroids for example

00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:11,840
which is actually not done with the it

00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:14,540
was is managing barczak but also in in

00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:18,560
in chorus well but those are things that

00:54:14,540 --> 00:54:20,090
are are defined and our have sufficient

00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:23,570
contrast so that if somebody is looking

00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:25,310
at your website they're they're not

00:54:23,570 --> 00:54:28,100
unless somebody says overwritten that in

00:54:25,310 --> 00:54:29,780
the theme there there are things that

00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:34,220
are going to come out and and and

00:54:29,780 --> 00:54:36,530
benefit people but it isn't yeah there's

00:54:34,220 --> 00:54:39,320
only solar so we can do to to to

00:54:36,530 --> 00:54:40,940
influence the the core themes are sorry

00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:43,930
the non core themes of contributed

00:54:40,940 --> 00:54:46,580
themes to adopt the best practices and

00:54:43,930 --> 00:54:49,520
part of it is setting the example and

00:54:46,580 --> 00:54:51,680
part of that is making sure that there's

00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:52,850
there's clear documentation about what

00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:57,680
are the best practices and how to

00:54:52,850 --> 00:55:00,920
evaluate your gradients and and the your

00:54:57,680 --> 00:55:02,440
your CSS to make sure that the CSS and

00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:06,890
images actually to make sure that the

00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:08,570
the proper contrast is there okay I want

00:55:06,890 --> 00:55:10,400
to be mindful of time so I'm going to

00:55:08,570 --> 00:55:12,320
ask you one last question really quick

00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:15,800
there were a couple people requesting

00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:19,010
actual presentations of what the

00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:20,660
features will look like and while Mike

00:55:19,010 --> 00:55:22,940
and I discussed that this is just going

00:55:20,660 --> 00:55:24,470
to be a little bit more talking about

00:55:22,940 --> 00:55:27,540
what to look forward to that hopefully

00:55:24,470 --> 00:55:30,180
when Drupal 8 is released we can

00:55:27,540 --> 00:55:35,100
to a demonstration and show showcase

00:55:30,180 --> 00:55:37,260
those features I'm definitely interested

00:55:35,100 --> 00:55:40,290
in showcasing individual features and

00:55:37,260 --> 00:55:42,650
providing assuming that I've got we've

00:55:40,290 --> 00:55:44,580
got the the technology issues worked out

00:55:42,650 --> 00:55:46,340
but it's also something where you don't

00:55:44,580 --> 00:55:50,040
have to wait till Drupal 8 is released

00:55:46,340 --> 00:55:54,020
there's a functioning version of Drupal

00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:56,580
that you can you can run right now from

00:55:54,020 --> 00:55:58,140
Drupal 8 core and you can evaluate it

00:55:56,580 --> 00:56:02,310
with a number of other modules as well

00:55:58,140 --> 00:56:05,580
the web page simply test dot me is a

00:56:02,310 --> 00:56:07,830
really terrific way to go off into both

00:56:05,580 --> 00:56:10,740
evaluate where cores at now and how

00:56:07,830 --> 00:56:12,450
things work and function now for sighted

00:56:10,740 --> 00:56:14,490
users of the screen reader users and

00:56:12,450 --> 00:56:17,640
this is being functioning then stable

00:56:14,490 --> 00:56:19,260
for a couple years now this is a really

00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:21,180
valuable resource for testing and

00:56:19,260 --> 00:56:25,140
evaluating but it also allows you to

00:56:21,180 --> 00:56:27,620
test patches so often when I'm trying to

00:56:25,140 --> 00:56:29,970
go off and test a patch I don't even

00:56:27,620 --> 00:56:31,650
install it on my own local environment

00:56:29,970 --> 00:56:34,560
most of the time most the time I simply

00:56:31,650 --> 00:56:38,850
you simply tests on me to evaluate how a

00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:41,700
a patch or a module will work with core

00:56:38,850 --> 00:56:43,140
and I value it if you're an anonymous

00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:45,720
user you have half an hour to go off

00:56:43,140 --> 00:56:47,460
into to test it and then to evaluate

00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:48,900
different components of it so I really

00:56:47,460 --> 00:56:52,110
encourage people to look at it

00:56:48,900 --> 00:56:54,570
themselves and learn how to to test what

00:56:52,110 --> 00:56:56,520
what works and doesn't work with four

00:56:54,570 --> 00:57:00,020
for their their focus groups are for

00:56:56,520 --> 00:57:03,690
themselves with the with Drupal 8 core

00:57:00,020 --> 00:57:05,310
that's really a great tip on and with

00:57:03,690 --> 00:57:07,650
that we're at the top of the hour so I

00:57:05,310 --> 00:57:10,290
just want to thank you Mike again for

00:57:07,650 --> 00:57:13,110
your your knowledge it clearly you are

00:57:10,290 --> 00:57:15,780
very well versed in this subject and I

00:57:13,110 --> 00:57:18,420
think this is a really fantastic way to

00:57:15,780 --> 00:57:20,880
make sure that we continue to be

00:57:18,420 --> 00:57:25,560
inclusive of everyone in our community

00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:28,740
and in our work so with that I will say

00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:31,260
thank you and just one last request you

00:57:28,740 --> 00:57:32,880
