just like wonderful okay you should all

00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:12,170
see my screen all right well I am

00:00:09,389 --> 00:00:17,400
reporting live from Paris France or I am

00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:18,960
happily working remotely here for the

00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:21,960
next four this whole month of March and

00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,189
it's been great I've just had lots of

00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,750
opportunities to connect with the

00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:26,609
European community I've already got a

00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:28,740
Drupal Camp London and spoke there at

00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:30,779
the cxo event and then I went to the

00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:34,350
German splash Awards where they were

00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:36,809
celebrating some really amazing case

00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:39,750
studies that were created for German

00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:41,610
clients and I'm getting ready to have

00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:43,980
dinner with the French Drupal

00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:46,860
Association next week and then go up to

00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:49,770
the Netherlands and participate in their

00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:52,770
splash Awards so it's just been a really

00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:55,140
great month and I eat in Eclair Chocolat

00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:58,949
every day so that is my that's my

00:00:55,140 --> 00:01:01,440
personal KPI so before we can I guess

00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:03,870
when do a little housekeeping I ask that

00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,250
you just remain muted but if you do have

00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:06,810
a question we want to hear from you and

00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:08,549
you can post at any time in the chat

00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:11,400
window Tim's gonna help me monitor that

00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:12,659
you hear something you like feel free to

00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,180
do a screenshot or

00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:20,130
tweet something out use the handle at

00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:22,740
Drupa lassos and our agendas we'll just

00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:24,270
highlight some key news happening here

00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:26,009
at the Drupal Association and go into

00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:27,630
our two main programs DrupalCon

00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:30,329
interpret org and give you some updates

00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:33,210
and I've asked Tim Lennon to join me so

00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:34,530
he could as director of engineering I'd

00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:36,840
like him to give you a little more

00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:40,310
insight into our work on drupal.org so

00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:44,250
you'll hear from him after me of course

00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:46,829
you're all our supporters and we really

00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:49,530
need your support for funding drupal.org

00:01:46,829 --> 00:01:51,149
which is the community home and lots of

00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:54,420
great things are happening there so we

00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:57,030
can't thank you enough for deciding to

00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:59,280
give back to the project in this way it

00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:02,040
really means a lot and it clearly takes

00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:06,840
a lot of you to help us fund drupal.org

00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:08,759
and so we try to provide the most value

00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,410
we can with this program but we

00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:11,849
recognize that this was a choice that

00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:13,420
you made to help us fund the

00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:15,760
infrastructure

00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:19,180
so thank you very much for your support

00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:21,819
and now let's head on NGO Drupal

00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:25,660
Association news you might have seen my

00:02:21,819 --> 00:02:26,500
very long blog post which is about our

00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:28,510
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:30,550
execution plans and I'd like to just

00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:32,380
walk through that very briefly and give

00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:35,140
you the highlights but again you can go

00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:40,150
on drupal.org slash association slash

00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:42,550
blog to find the longer post that gives

00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:45,400
more detail about our 2018 execution

00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:47,080
plan it also includes a dashboard of all

00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,670
of our projects with milestone and

00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:51,519
metrics and we'll be reporting out on

00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:54,100
that throughout the year the most

00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:56,769
important thing about our execution plan

00:02:54,100 --> 00:03:01,180
is that our primary goal is to help grow

00:02:56,769 --> 00:03:04,660
adoption of Drupal 8 in our channels

00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:07,900
Drupal Drupal con and drupal.org this

00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:10,180
big effort throughout the project to

00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:12,280
grow adoption in lots of different ways

00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:14,019
and of course we want to pull our weight

00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:18,160
in the areas that we can which are those

00:03:14,019 --> 00:03:19,959
through those two programs and so as we

00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:24,760
were thinking about our work we had some

00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:26,769
imperatives one was to grow adoption the

00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:29,019
Association really needs to expand the

00:03:26,769 --> 00:03:31,900
personas that we serve we've primarily

00:03:29,019 --> 00:03:33,280
been serving the builders and the

00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:36,430
builders who contribute back to the

00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:39,519
project and that can't stop we just need

00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:41,560
to do more because digital experiences

00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:43,959
require not just the builders but the

00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:46,420
people that are deciding if they should

00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:48,280
use Drupal or not there it also includes

00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:52,000
all the marketing people who use this

00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:54,610
the platform to get a business result

00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,530
and so we need to talk with them as well

00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:58,540
and we also need to talk with marketing

00:03:56,530 --> 00:04:00,640
because we're seeing that budgets that

00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:03,280
have been swinging and more CMOS or

00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:05,170
making technology buys so this is one

00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,329
area that we're focusing on as we think

00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:10,420
about our work is how do we talk to all

00:04:07,329 --> 00:04:12,459
these personas and help them choose

00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:14,530
Drupal and help them be power users of

00:04:12,459 --> 00:04:16,750
Drupal and then of course how do we help

00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:18,459
them find their own path into the

00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:21,489
community where they can contribute in

00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:23,050
their own unique way the other

00:04:21,489 --> 00:04:25,960
imperative is that we want to make it

00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:27,139
easier to choose Drupal so whether

00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:29,539
you're on Drupal

00:04:27,139 --> 00:04:31,310
or DrupalCon how can we make it easier

00:04:29,539 --> 00:04:33,949
for someone to come to the site or come

00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:35,539
to the event and say ah I'm getting the

00:04:33,949 --> 00:04:37,310
information I need and I want to move

00:04:35,539 --> 00:04:39,259
for with my evaluation path I want to

00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:42,770
choose Drupal that's a lot of effort

00:04:39,259 --> 00:04:44,569
into that and we also want to make sure

00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:47,800
that Drupal is as competitive as

00:04:44,569 --> 00:04:50,180
possible in areas that we can help is

00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:52,580
any ways to reduce total cost of

00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:54,020
ownership here that is one area that we

00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:56,810
could improve and so we're looking at

00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:59,000
auto-update so about that and that's

00:04:56,810 --> 00:05:00,409
really to help the mid market and then

00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,750
also easier to use

00:05:00,409 --> 00:05:05,990
we know a lot of people are not using

00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:08,539
composer and the command line to build

00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:10,520
Drupal and so we are gonna build a tool

00:05:08,539 --> 00:05:13,129
for site builders so that we can help

00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:14,659
them use Drupal 8 in a way that's kind

00:05:13,129 --> 00:05:18,650
of more aligned with how they are used

00:05:14,659 --> 00:05:20,960
to working with Drupal so our focus

00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:23,120
areas we have four one is to accelerate

00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:26,120
the adoption journey we want to inspire

00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:28,009
and inform evaluators starting to really

00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:30,259
amplify get people excited about what

00:05:28,009 --> 00:05:32,900
Drupal has done for all kinds of great

00:05:30,259 --> 00:05:35,120
names out there we want to help create

00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:37,599
these resources that an evaluator needs

00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,590
so that they can be converted into users

00:05:37,599 --> 00:05:41,690
and again as I mentioned we want to

00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:43,819
improve the product where we can in

00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:45,770
those areas that I mentioned the other

00:05:43,819 --> 00:05:49,099
focus area is we want to strengthen the

00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:51,620
user journey and so this is really about

00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:55,069
helping people keep falling in love with

00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:58,279
Drupal helping agencies like you have

00:05:55,069 --> 00:06:01,699
customers who retain your customers so

00:05:58,279 --> 00:06:03,860
they keep using Drupal the third area is

00:06:01,699 --> 00:06:05,690
supporting community health and there's

00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:08,270
lots of ways that we can do that but

00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:11,120
it's mostly really expanding how we

00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:16,009
serve and who we serve so that it's more

00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:18,830
global it has more personas and we just

00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:21,349
have a stronger relationship with the

00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:24,589
community both you know bridging this

00:06:21,349 --> 00:06:25,610
gap between Drew's bite art in the

00:06:24,589 --> 00:06:27,500
community and creating more

00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:30,020
opportunities for discussion as well as

00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:32,750
the Drupal Association in the community

00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:34,219
and then lastly we just want to build a

00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:36,500
stronger foundation of support for the

00:06:34,219 --> 00:06:38,850
Drupal Association of course we want to

00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:41,580
make sure we have happy staff and

00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:44,009
they love working here and in serving

00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:46,220
the mission but we are going to focus on

00:06:44,009 --> 00:06:49,289
organizational and financial health

00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:51,599
because obviously as we need to stay

00:06:49,289 --> 00:06:54,599
sustainable to keep our community

00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:56,699
support sustainable and again just

00:06:54,599 --> 00:06:59,789
getting more ambassadors out there for a

00:06:56,699 --> 00:07:01,500
drupal and the Drupal Association those

00:06:59,789 --> 00:07:03,810
are the four areas and here's a real

00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:05,819
simple heat map now look at the whole

00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:07,590
lifecycle you have the adoption part of

00:07:05,819 --> 00:07:09,539
the lifecycle then they turn into users

00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:12,060
and they become community members and I

00:07:09,539 --> 00:07:13,289
look at these three segments and you can

00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:15,360
see we're putting a lot of effort on the

00:07:13,289 --> 00:07:17,970
adoption side a little bit on the user

00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:20,910
side and second priority is the

00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:22,349
community side primarily because we have

00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:24,720
some catching up to do on the adoption

00:07:22,349 --> 00:07:26,070
aside does not mean we're going to be

00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:29,009
reducing anything we do for the

00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:31,349
community so let me just go through

00:07:29,009 --> 00:07:34,259
quickly some highlights of how we're

00:07:31,349 --> 00:07:39,449
going to be serving each of these three

00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:41,009
areas for current customers of course

00:07:39,449 --> 00:07:44,430
we'll have Drupal con and that really is

00:07:41,009 --> 00:07:46,500
a user event and a community contributor

00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:48,360
event it's really you know if you look

00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:52,259
at all the sections there it's really to

00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:54,360
help you be a power user and so you know

00:07:52,259 --> 00:07:56,159
that doesn't stop but one thing that's

00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:59,460
new is we want to know who our customers

00:07:56,159 --> 00:08:01,050
are there's a lot that we can a lot of

00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:04,199
insight we can gain if we know who our

00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:07,199
customers are what modules they're using

00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:08,490
etc etc and today the drupal

00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,949
associations not part of the sales

00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:13,800
process so we don't know however every

00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:17,130
website is coming to drupal.org and by

00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:20,099
working with Drupal core we can add some

00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:22,740
telemetry to Drupal 8 to Drupal core and

00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:26,159
be able to capture some information that

00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:28,320
can give us this insight and then we

00:08:26,159 --> 00:08:31,800
want to work with the community in some

00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:32,849
new ways so I've talked about how we

00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:35,399
want to work with the community on

00:08:32,849 --> 00:08:38,459
product improvement one is the auto

00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:40,169
updates initiative you know when I talk

00:08:38,459 --> 00:08:42,120
with companies in the mid market

00:08:40,169 --> 00:08:44,010
especially those that decided not to

00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:45,810
stay with Drupal they say it's a lot of

00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:48,449
it's because talents expensive and

00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:50,130
having talent doing manual updates is an

00:08:48,449 --> 00:08:52,710
expensive cost

00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:55,230
and the mid-market would really benefit

00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:57,840
from auto-updates and so the dribble

00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:59,910
association is going to work with Drupal

00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:02,850
core and other community members in

00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:06,300
order to start this initiative up and

00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:09,690
then also just a real fast not fast but

00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:11,820
a great way to grow Drupal adoption for

00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:13,770
Drupal 8 is to make it easier for site

00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:15,480
builders to you Drupal 8

00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:18,570
especially those that aren't using the

00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:19,950
command line for buildings so that's why

00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:23,190
we'll have that tool for site builders

00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:24,900
that I mentioned before we are also

00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:27,360
going to start having some roundtable

00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:30,660
starting at triple con Nashville and one

00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:32,250
will be a customer roundtable and I

00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:34,590
wanted to call this one out specifically

00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:37,080
we as the Association again we don't

00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:38,850
have that relationship with customers

00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:42,000
and we want them to be part of our

00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:44,370
community too so we've been reaching out

00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,200
to you as supporters to see if you have

00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:47,880
any customers they would like to spend

00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:50,250
two hours with us getting to know each

00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:54,330
other but also getting to understand

00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:55,710
like what can we do as a group to help

00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:59,370
customers become part of the community

00:09:55,710 --> 00:10:01,230
and see how they can invest in triples

00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:03,930
longevity in a way that benefits their

00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:05,130
business so that's the conversation we

00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:09,030
like to have and it will just be a

00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:10,380
peer-to-peer networking discussion and I

00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:15,000
hope it's the start of something much

00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:16,500
bigger in some other areas that we're

00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,740
focusing on is recognizing and rewarding

00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:21,750
community so we know that nothing gets

00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:23,850
done without all of our volunteers and

00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:26,430
people do their volunteer work for many

00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:28,470
reasons and one of them is for social

00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:30,480
capital right and it just really being

00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:32,850
known and seen as someone who's stepping

00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,470
up and leading and they just want to you

00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:36,720
know sometimes just to thank you really

00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:39,690
matters and so we have a contribution

00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:44,280
credit system that right now gives you

00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:47,130
credit if you submit a well code of

00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:49,650
course but Drupal 8 case study or of

00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:54,000
your supporting partner but we want to

00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:54,330
expand that to another area which are

00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,310
camp

00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:58,830
organizers you know as you probably know

00:10:56,310 --> 00:11:00,180
camps are little marketing machines all

00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:01,580
over the world that are attracting

00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:03,170
developers and

00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:05,870
also onboarding people to be

00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:08,990
contributors it's a great meeting place

00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:10,220
for companies to start to decide kind of

00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:13,580
at the ground level if they want to use

00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:16,399
Drupal and it takes a lot of work to

00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:19,029
organize a camp or really any kind of

00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:21,680
community event so we want to start

00:11:19,029 --> 00:11:23,600
recognizing them and the team's putting

00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:26,630
some efforts in place to be able to do

00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:29,540
that and we're also looking to keep

00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:31,579
enabling the community last year Tim and

00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:34,910
his team did a lot of work to assess

00:11:31,579 --> 00:11:37,700
developer tools I get lab and github and

00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:39,519
we had to put that on hold because we

00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:41,540
just found that it wasn't getting the

00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:42,980
features just weren't where the

00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:44,870
community needed them to be so we

00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:47,899
weren't ready to migrate but we're still

00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:49,579
exploring it as these tools evolve so

00:11:47,899 --> 00:11:52,420
what you know we did not forget that and

00:11:49,579 --> 00:11:55,700
we also hear a lot of interest in

00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:59,660
finding a way to fun project maintainer

00:11:55,700 --> 00:12:02,029
x' and you know cams wat fiscal

00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:04,279
sponsorship and right now the DA can

00:12:02,029 --> 00:12:05,630
provide it for some camps but we have

00:12:04,279 --> 00:12:08,420
some limitations so we're looking to

00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:10,510
scale more globally and we think a

00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:12,680
partnership with open collective could

00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:16,520
address some of these needs and allow

00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:17,930
people to collect money and and spend

00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:20,630
that money as they need to in a very

00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:24,440
transparent and compliant way and so

00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:28,220
we're exploring that partnership and

00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:30,620
then on the adoption side this is really

00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:33,110
about getting those decision-makers to

00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:35,240
say yes to dribble and again since we

00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:37,899
haven't been part of the sales cycle for

00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:40,490
us to do a great job and our channels

00:12:37,899 --> 00:12:42,380
talking to these to this audience we

00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:44,660
want to first understand them so we're

00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:46,370
doing user research right now very

00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:48,649
thankful for a board member and eemiller

00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:50,209
who's taking the time to do these

00:12:48,649 --> 00:12:53,240
interviews and she's talking to personas

00:12:50,209 --> 00:12:55,820
throughout the entire lifecycle to

00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:57,290
really understand what they think and

00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:58,760
what they feel and what they need in

00:12:57,290 --> 00:13:01,250
order to say yes I want to go to the

00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:02,930
next step so really excited to start

00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:06,050
pulling that information together and

00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:12,230
having it kind of drive the evolution of

00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:13,699
our programs and you know there's I'll

00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:15,050
go into more detail but again I

00:13:13,699 --> 00:13:19,250
mentioned who we want to inspire

00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:20,420
form these decision-makers and really

00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:22,790
get them to move through the evaluation

00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:24,890
process quickly and really frankly

00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:27,140
connect them to you we're not gonna be

00:13:24,890 --> 00:13:29,720
able to sell them on Drupal and help

00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:31,250
build them anything the most important

00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:33,950
thing is to have a conversion where they

00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:35,750
talk with you as trusted agencies who

00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:39,920
can deliver something really powerful

00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:42,230
for them and then the last area is that

00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:45,710
Drupal Association support so we've set

00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:49,730
up our kpi's financial perspective we

00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:53,300
are doing better with our financial turn

00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:55,970
around and we getting ready to put out

00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:58,610
some blog posts about that for 2017 the

00:13:55,970 --> 00:14:01,070
results were really positive and we hit

00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:03,680
our goals that show us that we are

00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:05,600
moving through that financial turnaround

00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,950
and becoming much more sustainable which

00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:09,680
means the project's becoming more

00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:11,180
sustainable which is wonderful and this

00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:13,790
year is going to be another important

00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:15,800
year for us I'd say that we're not a

00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:17,750
hundred percent done with this

00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:20,240
turnaround but we are starting to walk

00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:22,220
out of those woods and we'll be doing it

00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:25,190
with you and your support so thank you

00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:26,660
I definitely envision us doing a

00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:30,200
fundraising campaign this year to

00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:32,990
accelerate adoption I'm seeing a lot of

00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:34,730
needs I need to work with the team and

00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:40,010
the community to scope that out whether

00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:42,170
it is crowdsourcing funds to kill bugs

00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:44,360
to help people migrate from Drupal 7 to

00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:47,810
Drupal 8 or might be helping with

00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:50,360
documentation or it could be about

00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:53,810
crowdsourcing or getting some extra

00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:54,980
marketing power to do some PR so I'm

00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:56,990
just seeing a lot of things I just need

00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:58,610
to work with a community to prioritize

00:14:56,990 --> 00:15:02,420
that and then launch a fundraising

00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:04,340
campaign so we can execute and as you

00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:05,750
know we want to keep building strong

00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:07,220
relationship with the community and

00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:08,840
we're just really thrilled to have

00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:11,660
Rachel Lawson on staff as their

00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:12,650
community liaison and she is already

00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:14,420
starting to build a stronger

00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:16,040
relationship with the community she's

00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:18,110
out there engaging with the community

00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:20,210
you see her online answering questions

00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:24,080
and she'll be doing a lot at Drupal con

00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:26,120
Nashville and going to bops and these

00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,819
special roundtables and facilitating

00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:29,069
them so

00:15:26,819 --> 00:15:30,689
hopefully this kind of work in the

00:15:29,069 --> 00:15:31,679
different regions will make a real

00:15:30,689 --> 00:15:34,589
difference and building an

00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:36,809
ambassadorship for the association and

00:15:34,589 --> 00:15:38,699
then just another area to point out is

00:15:36,809 --> 00:15:41,100
we always need to worry about compliance

00:15:38,699 --> 00:15:44,850
risk so we're working for drupal.org

00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:46,589
sub-sites to be gdpr ready and right now

00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:49,229
we're working on all of our commerce

00:15:46,589 --> 00:15:50,609
sites being PCI compliant so those are

00:15:49,229 --> 00:15:55,499
important things just well that you know

00:15:50,609 --> 00:15:57,329
we've got our eye on the right stuff all

00:15:55,499 --> 00:16:01,259
right if there's not any questions at

00:15:57,329 --> 00:16:04,049
all keep going another announcement from

00:16:01,259 --> 00:16:07,439
the Drupal Association is that we have

00:16:04,049 --> 00:16:09,929
new board members terms are every three

00:16:07,439 --> 00:16:13,470
years if you're nominated if you're

00:16:09,929 --> 00:16:15,269
elected it's every two years and we

00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:18,059
actually expanded the number of people

00:16:15,269 --> 00:16:20,609
on the board and allows us to have more

00:16:18,059 --> 00:16:22,350
diversity specifically regional

00:16:20,609 --> 00:16:24,299
diversity as well as diversity of

00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:27,629
perspectives of different stakeholder

00:16:24,299 --> 00:16:31,499
perspectives on the board so we have

00:16:27,629 --> 00:16:34,289
Adam Goodman who's our chair he is gonna

00:16:31,499 --> 00:16:37,769
be with us through 2019 he's taking a

00:16:34,289 --> 00:16:40,979
seat that's a little truncated he's an

00:16:37,769 --> 00:16:43,529
interim chair which is why it didn't

00:16:40,979 --> 00:16:46,499
need to be um you know a full three

00:16:43,529 --> 00:16:48,959
years but his whole purpose is that he

00:16:46,499 --> 00:16:50,339
is a professor of leadership at

00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:52,079
Northwestern University he's been

00:16:50,339 --> 00:16:56,039
advising us for years and he wants to

00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:57,209
help orient us to being a board it's

00:16:56,039 --> 00:17:00,839
kind of taken it up a notch and

00:16:57,209 --> 00:17:04,169
strategic planning as well as a board

00:17:00,839 --> 00:17:06,029
that doesn't have the founder of the

00:17:04,169 --> 00:17:07,949
project as the chair and there's some

00:17:06,029 --> 00:17:09,750
just some changes that needed to happen

00:17:07,949 --> 00:17:11,429
around that and so he's just advising

00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:13,649
and helping us the right infrastructure

00:17:11,429 --> 00:17:15,059
and place for that Drees of course is

00:17:13,649 --> 00:17:17,159
still on the board

00:17:15,059 --> 00:17:19,919
but is in his founding director role

Netherlands as you'll see we have lots

of different kind of stakeholder

00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:12,490
interests represented here but really

00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:13,870
it's very heavily skewed to Europe we

00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:16,270
felt that we really needed to have more

00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:17,950
of a European voice on the board and so

00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:22,360
we're just really excited to have them

00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:24,700
there all right let's go into some

00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:27,429
updates about programs starting with

00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:29,470
Drupal con we're really excited it's

00:18:27,429 --> 00:18:31,750
gonna be here in less than a month which

00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:34,420
is crazy but everything's coming

00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:36,309
together really nicely we just put out

00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:39,670
the new schedule so go ahead and start

00:18:36,309 --> 00:18:41,140
making your plans one thing that you'll

00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:44,110
notice on the website that's new is we

00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:47,020
have why Drupal con we wanted to make

00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:48,760
sure that as we have all this content

00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:51,700
for different personas that it's easy to

00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:55,000
find so you can go to Y triple con and

00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:57,790
start seeing what I call recipes for

00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,650
different personas so you can get ideas

00:18:57,790 --> 00:19:01,059
of what to do for if you're an

00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:03,090
organization leader you'd be your

00:19:01,059 --> 00:19:06,820
director of engineering a triple a

00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:09,670
digital teams so whether it's digital

00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:12,390
teams at an agency or at an end-user

00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:16,179
there's all kinds of content for you

00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:18,070
this year we have content specifically

00:19:16,179 --> 00:19:21,550
for content editors training lab

00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:23,860
sessions so please make sure anyone you

00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:25,660
know is a content editor make sure they

00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:28,030
know this is available to them I really

00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:29,650
want to get them there and then of

00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:31,480
course this is probably the most

00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:35,350
interesting to you but digital agencies

00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:37,300
we have lots of content to help you as a

00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:39,780
digital agency whether it's the business

00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:42,220
track or the business summit or

00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:44,910
different case studies to inspire you

00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:49,080
and also some really great talks about

00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:51,820
what's happening in the marketplace so

00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:54,010
check that one out for sure and then of

00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:56,590
course we have others whether it's all

00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:58,570
kinds of content for building decoupled

00:19:56,590 --> 00:20:01,210
solutions some are technical in nature

00:19:58,570 --> 00:20:04,990
some are talking about the solutions

00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:06,940
that are made through decoupled efforts

00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:10,330
and then we have all of our case studies

00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:11,800
aggregated here and then if you want to

00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:13,270
learn how to get involved with the

00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:15,280
community while a triple con whether

00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:16,960
you're a new community member a longtime

00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:20,140
community member we've aggregated all

00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:21,760
that information in this recipe and then

00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:23,950
for new attendees maybe have a new

00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:25,600
employee going for the first time they

00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:29,740
should check out the new attendee page

00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:32,260
so they can see all the great ways that

00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:38,020
we make it easy for someone to get

00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:39,940
involved and feel really welcome and we

00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:41,050
are promoting by personas as well so

00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:44,020
you'll see that we're taking this

00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:45,580
content and tweeting it out definitely

00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:48,480
trying to start moving into this more

00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:50,980
persona based marketing for our event

00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:53,440
some highlights that I thought that you

00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:56,350
as digital agency owners might want to

00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:58,360
know about are the supporter roundtable

00:20:56,350 --> 00:21:01,300
you should have received an email to

00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:03,130
save the date Wednesday from 3 to 5 this

00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:04,510
is a opportunity for us as the

00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:08,340
Association to talk with you

00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:10,960
specifically about what are your needs

00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:13,150
you know we are hearing a lot of

00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:15,450
different kinds of needs that the

00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:19,420
Association might be able to help with

00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:22,000
and we want to get aligned and we want

00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:25,240
to find a way that we can invest in this

00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:28,750
together especially in a way that

00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:30,220
doesn't defund drupal.org but we're

00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:31,990
definitely hearing the need for some

00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:35,440
partnership here and we'd like to have

00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:36,940
that conversation with you again I

00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:39,580
mentioned the customer roundtable that's

00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:43,540
Tuesday from 10:30 to 12:30 it's hosted

00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:45,430
by Mike lamb from Pfizer director of

00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:47,920
engineering at Pfizer it's going to be a

00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:50,140
peer-to-peer discussion and I think it'd

00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:53,020
be really great for any customer to come

00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:54,280
to this and start finding who their

00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:55,780
peers are and asking some of those

00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:59,140
questions that keep them up at night and

00:21:55,780 --> 00:22:01,750
being with people like Mike who are true

00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:03,430
believers in Drupal but more than

00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:04,460
anything is that chance for us to hear

00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:05,780
how we can help

00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:09,340
and help them become part of our

00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:12,110
community another thing that we're doing

00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:13,460
thanks to Donna Benjamin another board

00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:17,480
members we're going to be doing

00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:19,760
testimonial videos a triple con we want

00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:21,590
to talk to everyone and get testimonial

00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:22,880
videos that can be turned into the

00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:24,200
different kinds of sizzle reel on

00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:26,510
drupal.org on DrupalCon

00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:29,600
really promoting wide ripples so great

00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:33,620
or why the community is so great and we

00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:35,960
would love to find out if you would like

00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:38,540
to be videotaped

00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:41,690
I think videotape just aged me but if

00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:44,090
you like that we would love to hear your

00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:46,100
story and your customer story and your

00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:49,280
staff members stories so please be on

00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:50,900
the lookout and also some it's all kinds

00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:52,700
of special events happening at triple

00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:55,040
con but just don't forget the Monday

00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:56,900
opening reception this is when we open

00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:58,310
up the sponsor like the exhibit hall on

00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:59,660
the sponsor floor and everyone can come

00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:02,120
together and there's a lot of energy

00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:05,450
there so I highly recommend you're there

00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:07,040
at your booth and then Wednesday after

00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:10,580
the supporter roundtable is the VIP

00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:12,380
happy hour and this is a a chance for us

00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:14,540
to say thank you and you can do some

00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:17,930
some final networking before the end of

00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:23,540
the day it's a couple hours of drinks

00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:25,340
and light bites and good times all right

00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:29,930
and then let me just go over to Tripp

00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:31,940
org and give you some sneak peeks so we

00:23:29,930 --> 00:23:34,190
are working on improving the adoption

00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:36,500
journey starting at the front page which

00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:38,600
is where we know evaluators are going to

00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:41,360
and this is what it looks like today you

00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:44,810
can see as all kinds of call-to-action

00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:48,020
and videos this is thanks to talk we are

00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:49,880
always looking for our partners content

00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:53,420
we don't have a team to create content

00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:55,100
so we're very thankful when when you can

00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:56,900
provide yours for the site to help with

00:23:55,100 --> 00:24:00,100
this evaluation path because we have

00:23:56,900 --> 00:24:03,890
news and all kinds of things on the site

00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:07,040
but we know that it can be better and a

00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:11,300
more streamlined evaluation path that's

00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:12,890
what I think to choose Drupal yeah no

00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:14,120
this is Tim I was just gonna say to add

00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:15,440
on to that one of the things that you

00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:17,300
can see immediately when you look at

00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:18,269
this page is that it's oriented towards

00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:19,529
the builders of

00:24:18,269 --> 00:24:21,809
of all those personas that we've talked

00:24:19,529 --> 00:24:23,519
about em not to the additional personas

00:24:21,809 --> 00:24:25,739
that are really part of our 2018 focus

00:24:23,519 --> 00:24:27,599
and so we have already done some data

00:24:25,739 --> 00:24:29,009
gathering to get some more information

00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:31,679
about who it is that comes to this front

00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:33,599
page and to understand better especially

00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:38,749
the anonymous traffic about who's here

00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:41,459
so if you go to the next slide Megan so

00:24:38,749 --> 00:24:43,859
we've done a little bit of data

00:24:41,459 --> 00:24:45,419
gathering as I said about who comes to

00:24:43,859 --> 00:24:47,190
Drupal at Oregon specifically who hits

00:24:45,419 --> 00:24:51,029
the front page versus the other areas of

00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:52,649
site and one of the relatively

00:24:51,029 --> 00:24:55,229
interesting data points is about 14 out

00:24:52,649 --> 00:24:56,700
of 15 visitors are anonymous they're not

00:24:55,229 --> 00:24:58,919
our authenticated users they're not our

00:24:56,700 --> 00:25:01,859
highly engaged community members they

00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:04,919
are other people from other walks of

00:25:01,859 --> 00:25:06,839
life who are evaluating Drupal and who

00:25:04,919 --> 00:25:08,369
are kind of an unheard but very large

00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:10,339
part of our community and we want to

00:25:08,369 --> 00:25:14,909
hear them better and serve them better

00:25:10,339 --> 00:25:16,079
so we've gathered some data using a

00:25:14,909 --> 00:25:17,909
couple of different tools about our

00:25:16,079 --> 00:25:20,849
anonymous traffic and so we understand a

00:25:17,909 --> 00:25:23,129
little bit better who they are and kind

00:25:20,849 --> 00:25:24,539
of what industry they're in what area of

00:25:23,129 --> 00:25:27,779
expertise they're coming from and things

00:25:24,539 --> 00:25:30,089
like that so as you can see this table

00:25:27,779 --> 00:25:32,879
sort of outlines those anonymous

00:25:30,089 --> 00:25:34,499
visitors by their job function and gives

00:25:32,879 --> 00:25:36,239
some information about the proportion of

00:25:34,499 --> 00:25:38,219
frontpage visitors in that job function

00:25:36,239 --> 00:25:39,719
versus all visitors so you can see for

00:25:38,219 --> 00:25:41,789
example that all visitors to the site

00:25:39,719 --> 00:25:42,959
leans heavily towards people who are in

00:25:41,789 --> 00:25:45,209
engineering or information technology

00:25:42,959 --> 00:25:47,070
roles but the proportion of front page

00:25:45,209 --> 00:25:47,989
visitors has actually quite a high

00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:50,549
amount of business development

00:25:47,989 --> 00:25:53,219
entrepreneurship roles marketing roles

00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:54,839
median communication design in other

00:25:53,219 --> 00:25:57,419
words end users and personas that we

00:25:54,839 --> 00:25:59,879
haven't historically been serving but

00:25:57,419 --> 00:26:02,519
who are increasingly the decision makers

00:25:59,879 --> 00:26:04,529
in choosing whether to adopt rupal so we

00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:05,820
now have some hard numbers and we're

00:26:04,529 --> 00:26:08,129
continuing to gather some more data on

00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:10,829
that if you go to the next slide we have

00:26:08,129 --> 00:26:14,789
a little bit of information on the some

00:26:10,829 --> 00:26:16,320
of the specific job titles of some of

00:26:14,789 --> 00:26:18,869
these roles whether it's people and

00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:21,959
managers managerial roles EXO level

00:26:18,869 --> 00:26:24,349
director level in various kinds of

00:26:21,959 --> 00:26:30,119
departmental roles and things like that

00:26:24,349 --> 00:26:31,349
if we keep going so we've done some user

00:26:30,119 --> 00:26:33,020
research and these were interviews

00:26:31,349 --> 00:26:35,690
conducted

00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:38,000
in part by million in part by others on

00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:40,760
the team just talking to various people

00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:43,580
about what the experience is like coming

00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:46,970
to drupal.org and one of the some of the

00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:48,650
consistent themes were you know we the

00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:51,770
current front page is covered in calls

00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:53,539
to action because we have you know

00:26:51,770 --> 00:26:56,360
promoting the Tri Drupal program getting

00:26:53,539 --> 00:26:59,450
the code coming to joke on all sorts of

00:26:56,360 --> 00:27:01,730
industry calls to action and there's not

00:26:59,450 --> 00:27:03,080
a certain level of consistency about who

00:27:01,730 --> 00:27:04,820
those different calls to action are for

00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:06,860
and what the right path is for any

00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:09,049
individual evaluator who's coming to the

00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:11,179
site we also know that there's a

00:27:09,049 --> 00:27:12,740
difference in what kind of evaluator

00:27:11,179 --> 00:27:15,380
experience these different kind of users

00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:16,779
want so the technical evaluators want

00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:18,799
the opportunity to play with Drupal

00:27:16,779 --> 00:27:22,850
marketing evaluators want value

00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:24,500
proposition and demos and and the they

00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:28,100
want to be shown how Drupal will empower

00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:29,929
them to to fulfill the business need so

00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:32,690
in addition to this research we did some

00:27:29,929 --> 00:27:34,490
comparative analysis of just other

00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:36,740
projects whether open source or not

00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:38,809
software programs and that are out there

00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:43,010
so for example we have puppets front

00:27:38,809 --> 00:27:49,840
page if we go further we have the Drupal

00:27:43,010 --> 00:27:52,730
calm persona personas listed out and

00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:55,279
more or less we we evaluated these came

00:27:52,730 --> 00:27:58,399
together had a an off-site here in

00:27:55,279 --> 00:28:01,190
Portland and and came up with a game

00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:02,390
plan for identifying the top three

00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:05,000
personas and how to serve them on

00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:06,500
drupal.org so the the next slides are

00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,760
going to be some rough mock-ups these

00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:10,100
are not final designs although I'll show

00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:12,950
some design comps in a minute some

00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:14,899
changes that are upcoming so among other

00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:19,850
things we're changing the top navigation

00:28:14,899 --> 00:28:21,710
on drupal.org we're gonna focus on the

00:28:19,850 --> 00:28:25,039
answering the question why Drupal by

00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:28,490
persona we're gonna we're going to

00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:29,390
provide more pathways to the kind of

00:28:28,490 --> 00:28:32,240
information that you might need

00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:33,620
depending on your evaluator role we're

00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:36,740
going to highlight a try Drupal program

00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:38,720
up in the top navigation and we're going

00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:41,570
to change the primary call to action on

00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:45,890
the front page in some form if you go to

00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:47,720
the next slide again Meghan to be

00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:49,730
persona focused so we want people to

00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:51,320
identify themselves as you know

00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:52,760
developers or technical users or

00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:55,760
business users or marketing users or

00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:57,710
agency users and and then we can funnel

00:28:55,760 --> 00:29:01,760
them into a much more targeted path that

00:28:57,710 --> 00:29:03,110
will let them know the information

00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:05,900
they're really looking for to understand

00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:08,330
why they want to use Drupal and we've

00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:10,970
also identified some metrics to let us

00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:13,760
know whether we consider that evaluator

00:29:10,970 --> 00:29:15,440
to have converted so for example our

00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:17,450
conversion metrics for a developer

00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:19,400
evaluator would be things like whether

00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:21,590
they've spun up a try Drupal instance or

00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:23,240
another sandbox as we develop further

00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:25,730
demo experiences or whether they've

00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:27,980
simply downloaded the software for the

00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:30,470
marketers and business users whether

00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:32,900
they viewed videos or whether they've

00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:34,190
gone to the contact page which tries to

00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:36,950
connect them with supporting partners

00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:40,160
like yourselves and for the agency users

00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:43,670
whether they've downloaded resources

00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:44,870
that we provide like the CXO report and

00:29:43,670 --> 00:29:46,790
other things that we gathered throughout

00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:49,100
the year to provide back out to the

00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:55,220
community and to try and help a business

00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:57,830
decide to to make its bet on Drupal so

00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:59,540
to give a little bit more color here are

00:29:57,830 --> 00:30:02,630
some early actually you know

00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:04,060
well-designed monks of what the the new

00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:07,550
front-page experience could look like

00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:11,620
and these are still very early but we're

00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:14,750
going to have some a much more simple

00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:16,340
design many fewer calls to action

00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:18,920
probably fewer still than even you see

00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:21,560
here some animation to draw the eye and

00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:24,830
draw attention and then the segmentation

00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:28,880
into the three primary personas that we

00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:31,490
want to target so and if you go to the

00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:33,650
next slide we'll continue with the rest

00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:37,010
of the page continuing to feature case

00:30:33,650 --> 00:30:38,600
studies point people how to get involved

00:30:37,010 --> 00:30:41,450
in the community and provide some stats

00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:42,740
about the project so that's still very

00:30:41,450 --> 00:30:44,900
much a work in progress this is

00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:46,970
definitely a sneak preview but we hope

00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:50,360
to be showing off more about this coming

00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:52,580
up in Nashville in the meantime we've

00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:55,670
done a few small things as men Megan

00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:57,380
mentioned earlier we put up the video

00:30:55,670 --> 00:30:59,060
that was generously put together by aqua

00:30:57,380 --> 00:31:01,130
to promote

00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:04,160
drupal and some of the brands and

00:31:01,130 --> 00:31:07,580
stories and great success stories for

00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:10,670
the Drupal project and that's been a

00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:12,380
really interesting experiment in in

00:31:10,670 --> 00:31:13,880
putting more more sizzle on the front

00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:16,250
page as we've been saying internally and

00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:17,180
more kind of marketing oriented material

00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:18,590
and we're going to continue

00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:21,440
experimenting with other things like

00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:22,940
that I'm gonna switch over now to some

00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:24,470
other initiatives not specifically

00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:26,090
related to our persona work but just

00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:29,570
related to other things we've been doing

00:31:26,090 --> 00:31:31,700
on drupal.org so for example we are

00:31:29,570 --> 00:31:33,800
trying to be more inclusive with our

00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:38,120
sign up process on the front page so we

00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:40,340
have provided a new field to ask people

00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:42,310
to identify with underrepresented

00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:43,970
communities based on their

00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:45,110
self-assessment of whether or not

00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:46,400
they're a part of those communities to

00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:48,320
give us more information about our

00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:53,360
community and areas where we can do

00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:54,800
better we have also worked with core as

00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:56,690
Megan referred to earlier to propose

00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:58,940
four initiatives in the ideas queue and

00:31:56,690 --> 00:32:00,170
I'll try and be brief because Megan has

00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:01,940
talked about most of these one was the

00:32:00,170 --> 00:32:03,710
automating automatic updates initiative

00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:05,690
initially proposed by juries at UConn

00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:08,150
Deana the site builder and project

00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:09,620
browser tool telemetry and Drupal core

00:32:08,150 --> 00:32:11,960
to give us that information about how a

00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:13,730
pool is actually being used and lastly a

00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:17,000
communication channel in court because

00:32:13,730 --> 00:32:18,800
again we know that 14 out of 15 drupal

00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:21,500
adored visitors don't register for an

00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:23,030
account don't login are not people who

00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:24,410
are regularly in our communication

00:32:23,030 --> 00:32:25,940
channels even though we have such a

00:32:24,410 --> 00:32:27,500
large community and it feels like we

00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:28,700
must be talking to everyone there's

00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:30,740
actually a large number of people who we

00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:32,600
may not reach and so we want to create

00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:34,970
this channel within core to reach those

00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:37,340
those end users of Drupal who are maybe

00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:42,170
not engaged with the community yet so

00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:43,520
that's an additional proposal as well in

00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:46,220
the meantime we've been doing some

00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:49,310
things never forgetting the developer

00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:51,050
experience so we've added some in

00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:52,850
context explanation for what issue tags

00:32:51,050 --> 00:32:54,710
mean for contributors so they understand

00:32:52,850 --> 00:32:58,150
what the state of something is as core

00:32:54,710 --> 00:33:01,040
is reviewing their work and we've been

00:32:58,150 --> 00:33:02,750
working on making Drupal 8 or more

00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:04,340
performant and better protected on the

00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:06,460
web so if you go to the next slide

00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:10,790
Meghan we've recently partnered with

00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:12,200
perimeter X which is a sort of bad bot

00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:14,179
protection

00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:17,450
that actor Protection Service that

00:33:14,179 --> 00:33:19,730
integrates with our CDN we actually get

00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:21,649
targeted in denial of service tax almost

00:33:19,730 --> 00:33:23,120
by monthly so it's something that the

00:33:21,649 --> 00:33:24,710
team has been sort of dealing with in

00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:26,600
the background and I'm kind of proud to

00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:30,200
say that it has almost no visible impact

00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:32,779
on end users of the site and hasn't for

00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:34,220
several years now but we're always

00:33:32,779 --> 00:33:36,380
trying to find ways to make that more

00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:39,350
robust to better protect the community's

00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:40,639
home and to make sure that those people

00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:43,639
who are contributing to the projects

00:33:40,639 --> 00:33:46,399
just don't aren't disrupted in their

00:33:43,639 --> 00:33:49,880
work finally we've done a little bit of

00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:52,610
work more work on Drupal CI and working

00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:56,870
with core there's a lot of efforts to

00:33:52,610 --> 00:33:59,929
make better tools for adding JavaScript

00:33:56,870 --> 00:34:02,090
to Drupal whether that's focusing on

00:33:59,929 --> 00:34:04,340
perhaps making react a standard

00:34:02,090 --> 00:34:07,159
framework in Jaipur or just focusing on

00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:10,550
the regular JavaScript interactions that

00:34:07,159 --> 00:34:13,159
we already have so to do that to support

00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:15,169
that we've had to update the testing

00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:16,700
system what we used before to test the

00:34:15,169 --> 00:34:18,139
jobs your code and rapport was phantoms

00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:19,700
yes that was deprecated by its

00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:22,700
maintainer so we moved it to Chrome web

00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:25,210
driver and supported a few new Java

00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:27,859
scripts related testing Suites to help

00:34:25,210 --> 00:34:29,419
