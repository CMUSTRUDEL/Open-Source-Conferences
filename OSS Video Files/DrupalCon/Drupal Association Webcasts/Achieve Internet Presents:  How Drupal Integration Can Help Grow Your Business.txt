we've been community supporters since

00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:57,150
the beginning so it's sort of a

00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:59,370
no-brainer for us yeah I I really enjoy

00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:03,510

00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:08,129
like you know I'm glad to be here and

00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:10,049
this is you know how Drupal integrations

00:04:08,129 --> 00:04:13,410
can grow your organization and that

00:04:10,049 --> 00:04:16,229
being how you can tie in disparate

00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:18,720
systems if you have legacy systems or if

00:04:16,229 --> 00:04:21,570
you add third-party applications how you

00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:25,080
can tie those in with your drupal CMS to

00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:27,780
further advance and to grow to become

00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:29,100
more efficient in streamlined

00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:32,700
so I'm going to sort of share some of

00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:36,030
our past case studies and then some more

00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:38,340
tangible tools that you can take away

00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:41,669
from this presentation you know right

00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:45,389
after to help integrate a little easier

00:04:41,669 --> 00:04:47,669
with your drupal CMS well you know if

00:04:45,389 --> 00:04:50,220
that Salesforce or Oracle or SharePoint

00:04:47,669 --> 00:04:53,669
Marketo you know marketing automation

00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:57,720
tools you know any social media tools

00:04:53,669 --> 00:04:59,520
etc so our guys that achieve are all

00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:01,800
really technology solution architects

00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:04,470
and so we always believed that these

00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:05,820
tools can be twice as effective by

00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:09,090
seamlessly integrating them with

00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:12,390
withdrew bolts and I really like to

00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:15,810
refer to our team members as API lucha

00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:17,700
libres if you will they've had cat

00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:20,850
they've wrestled with countless api's

00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:23,250
and integration projects and they always

00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:26,880
come out on top so you know we have a

00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:30,090
very good solid group of developers and

00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:32,640
are you know I'm going to sort of share

00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:37,260
some of that experience and where you

00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:40,410
can take your triple CMS so a little bit

00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:42,390
about the agenda you know going to talk

00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:44,850
about how you can sort of get ahead

00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:47,520
which your roadblocks maybe all the

00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:49,800
options out there with when you talk

00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:51,990
about third-party applications you know

00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:54,419
how you can really tighten your close

00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:56,190
that loop with Drupal and then some

00:05:54,419 --> 00:05:59,100
immediate improvements so that you can

00:05:56,190 --> 00:06:00,479
take again take away from this and drop

00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:02,610
that into your website right away but

00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:05,910
then you know bigger problems sort of

00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:09,539
the two-way communications and we'll do

00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:11,580
to real-world case studies and then

00:06:09,539 --> 00:06:14,729
we'll do some question and answer if

00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:16,800
anyone has any so really in today's you

00:06:14,729 --> 00:06:19,020
know digital marketplace there are so

00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:21,030
many tools out there to really improve

00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:24,030
your organizational efficiencies is

00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:26,760
whether that be marketing or selling or

00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:29,460
content creation engagement client

00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:32,070
engagement you know managing user

00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:34,470
profiles etc but if that tools really

00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:36,479
not meeting its expectations it could

00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:38,640
end up hindering your staff more than

00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:41,310
helping you know we've seen it time and

00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:43,350
time again with I guess clothes provide

00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:46,020
Terry systems you know technology is

00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:49,320
supposed to automate and help enhance

00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:51,090
your efficiencies and enhance your you

00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:53,070
know workflows but sometimes that can

00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:56,040
end up really slowing you down if it's

00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:58,410
not you know tied in together correctly

00:06:56,040 --> 00:07:00,420
with your CMS so if you're using a

00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:02,520
third-party tool you know to increase

00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:04,170
your growth and you need to ask if it's

00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:07,380
really truly helping and making you

00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:08,880
effective is it and this presentation is

00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:12,780
really about more getting more out of

00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:14,760
those platforms by leveraging Drupal so

00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:17,640
it's going to be focused on how Drupal

00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:21,030
can really help your growth rate so dive

00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:23,160
right in so if you are in a highly

00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:25,080
competitive market which I'm assuming

00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:27,150
most of us are you need to really get

00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:29,130
the most out of your team and that's

00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:33,090
where these third-party applications

00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:34,680
really come into play so in the past you

00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:37,110
know we've seen really challenging

00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:40,230
cumbersome or inefficient marketing

00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:42,240
processes or publishing processes you

00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:44,580
know dealing with multiple content

00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:47,550
authors and editors or fulfillment and

00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:49,530
sales process and so investing in

00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:51,500
third-party technology solutions can

00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:54,180
drastically benefit your revenue growth

00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:55,560
but really just setting that application

00:07:54,180 --> 00:08:00,690
up and putting your staff to the

00:07:55,560 --> 00:08:02,790
training really usually not enough so

00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:05,880
we're going to cover how an effective

00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:08,490
integration strategy using Drupal will

00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:12,530
improve your growth to help you separate

00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:14,910
yourself from the pack so there are

00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:18,600
abundant options out there this is just

00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:20,220
a smattering of great third-party tools

00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:23,040
and they're really amazing at what they

00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:25,410
do and that's one of our focuses here at

00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:28,760
achieve is not replacing these these are

00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:32,310
fantastic I mean MailChimp you know

00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:35,030
hubspot it would salesforce they're

00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:38,940
really good at what they do but they can

00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:41,580
you can really enhance them and extend

00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:44,210
them without replacing them and they

00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:47,270
specialize in marketing automation email

00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:51,120
marketing database management

00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:53,040
gamification you know it runs the whole

00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,140
gamut they're giving you more insight

00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,840
into your customers

00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:58,520
your clients or prospects and then your

00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:01,430
opportunities than ever before but

00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:03,920
usually there's always something missing

00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:06,140
some aspect that it's that is not doing

00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:08,810
that you really wish your tool did they

00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:10,880
offer their limited in their

00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:13,400
customization so inevitably there's

00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:15,350
going to be a gap in functionality and

00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:16,970
not to mention the disconnect when we

00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:19,010
add additional platforms so you add a

00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:22,150
marketing automation tool you add a

00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:26,210
sales force or a sales tool or you a day

00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:28,640
you know content distribution network or

00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:30,950
you know your SharePoint for document

00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,720
management and what happens when we add

00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:34,340
those additional platforms you know

00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,350
typically they don't speak the same

00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:38,540
language so you end up just perpetuating

00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:40,460
the problem you with a whole host of

00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:45,650
disparate and disconnected systems and

00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:47,480
tools which ends up hurting you because

00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:49,820
now you're setting your staff has to

00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:51,920
juggle multiple logins different

00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:55,700
interfaces different functionality and

00:09:51,920 --> 00:10:00,050
the worst silo data so you're copying

00:09:55,700 --> 00:10:03,740
and pasting in one contact or one lead

00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:05,720
or one enrollment or one user profile

00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:08,360
from one system to the next just to get

00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:10,280
that data into that system when really

00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:12,950
again technology is supposed to automate

00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:15,050
that so the staff your your staff is

00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:18,370
manually making up for your gap and

00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:21,440
functionality which is a waste of time

00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:23,720
and drupal really can close the loop and

00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:26,270
help you extend your current platforms

00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:27,950
to create a tightly integrated ecosystem

00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:30,590
because without a proper integration

00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:32,720
strategy you decrease the value of these

00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:34,610
applications because they're not cheap

00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,350
you're paying form so you should get one

00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:37,880
hundred percent out of them but

00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:39,590
ultimately you you can stunt your growth

00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:41,900
as a business you can really slow

00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:46,990
yourself down and grind yourself to a

00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:49,850
hole so this is where drupal comes in

00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:51,890
it's really a complete web experience

00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:54,200
and it plays nicely with whatever other

00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:58,220
systems you choose to work with very

00:10:54,200 --> 00:11:00,260
flexible and extensible and it can be

00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:02,170
sort of this conduit for all your data

00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:06,080
to help connect your disparate systems

00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:08,480
so you know highly extensible and it can

00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:10,120
be the hub sort of of your various app

00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:13,430
locations and digital infrastructure

00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:15,290
because really you know these killer web

00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:17,899
experiences are built on these

00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:19,670
best-of-breed tools and like I said

00:11:17,899 --> 00:11:22,160
before it Drupal is not a replacement

00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:25,279
for your application just a way to get

00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:27,260
more out of them it makes it easy to add

00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:29,480
third-party tools to increase and

00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:31,760
increase their functionality by getting

00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:33,980
them to play nicely together and speak

00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:35,360
sort of the same language because you

00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:37,850
know you made the investment in this

00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:41,149
platform so you should really demand the

00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:43,130
most out of it so you might be asking

00:11:41,149 --> 00:11:44,449
how does this work in practice how can

00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:47,029
an integration with Drupal really

00:11:44,449 --> 00:11:49,250
improve my growth I'm going to dive into

00:11:47,029 --> 00:11:51,370
that right now so your effective

00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:54,620
technology solutions can sort of

00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:57,529
correspond with each layer of B is the

00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:59,600
customer or the user sort of decision

00:11:57,529 --> 00:12:01,519
journey they start at the top they

00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,740
become aware of your site in your

00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:06,529
service they come down and they consider

00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:09,170
it over versus another maybe it's a you

00:12:06,529 --> 00:12:11,899
know education for enrollment or you

00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:14,149
know it's at an HR system you convert

00:12:11,899 --> 00:12:16,699
and then you start this loyalty loop and

00:12:14,149 --> 00:12:19,699
they really correspond with each step in

00:12:16,699 --> 00:12:21,860
this in this journey if you will when

00:12:19,699 --> 00:12:23,870
when leveraged correctly they can help

00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:26,240
create an ideal flow from start to

00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:28,760
finish all these applications can really

00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:30,680
improve and speed up the time it takes a

00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:34,970
passive audience member to work their

00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:36,949
way down this fall and at every stage of

00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:39,709
the journey these applications should

00:12:36,949 --> 00:12:42,110
complement your efforts not not slow you

00:12:39,709 --> 00:12:43,819
down so Drupal offers contributed

00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:45,920
modules that can be added to your site

00:12:43,819 --> 00:12:47,480
for basic communication but it also

00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:50,029
lends itself to highly technical

00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:51,680
solutions that can supercharge your pure

00:12:50,029 --> 00:12:55,699
efficiencies and your growth which I'm

00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:58,220
going to dive into in a few slides so

00:12:55,699 --> 00:13:00,529
I'm going to go over a few quick ways on

00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:02,120
how these tools can create sort of this

00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:03,589
ideal decision journey and you can

00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:06,889
implement them right after this session

00:13:03,589 --> 00:13:10,069
so to make an immediate impact and drive

00:13:06,889 --> 00:13:12,709
results so you first start with

00:13:10,069 --> 00:13:17,060
awareness how do we attract your users

00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:19,579
to your site and assuming is a drupal

00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:22,170
CMS this is the drupal association so

00:13:19,579 --> 00:13:24,680
that's what I'm focused on

00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:26,850
you got to attract users to your site

00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:29,310
obviously lowest hanging fruit right now

00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:32,579
with social media it can increase

00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:34,110
awareness but what's simple with what's

00:13:32,579 --> 00:13:36,329
great about Drupal is you can really

00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:40,410
just drop a line of code inside a

00:13:36,329 --> 00:13:43,380
content inside the WYSIWYG editor on the

00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:45,720
HTML and you can add a share or tweet or

00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:47,490
a Pinterest button right to your site

00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:50,010
right to your content and that allows

00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:53,279
your users to you know propagate your

00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:55,769
content across their network you know it

00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:59,610
grows exponentially and attracts more

00:13:55,769 --> 00:14:02,730
users to your site so this is again

00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:05,430
immediate increase in exposure so just a

00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:08,610
simple you know a simple module a simple

00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:11,880
line of code and you have you know your

00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:13,800
social media connections and again this

00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:16,410
is all when I'm focusing on right now is

00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:18,540
all one-way communication so pushing out

00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:20,370
to the platform pushing out to the

00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:22,680
application I'm going to go into this

00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:27,120
sort of two-way continuous integration

00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:29,070
and a few slides later and then once you

00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,930
have them to your site you've attracted

00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:33,350
them your focus should be on really

00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:36,060
getting them to consider you over a

00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:37,740
another vendor another competitor etc

00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:40,430
and you really want to increase the

00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:43,800
probability that they will favor you

00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:46,079
versus someone else and so how do you do

00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:48,660
that you set up you know content you set

00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:51,949
up offers you set up web leads and you

00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:54,779
can with simple modules for all of these

00:14:51,949 --> 00:14:57,690
applications all have simple modules on

00:14:54,779 --> 00:14:59,570
you know ddoddo and you add that and

00:14:57,690 --> 00:15:02,220
it's again a one-way communication

00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:05,970
Drupal pushes all the information from

00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:09,269
that web form right into into this

00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:11,699
application so you have that about you

00:15:09,269 --> 00:15:14,490
go into the Drupal back end you know

00:15:11,699 --> 00:15:17,069
copy paste or export as a CSV file from

00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:19,560
a landing page or a form and then upload

00:15:17,069 --> 00:15:21,329
it into your into your system things

00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:24,120
don't get lost there's no confusion and

00:15:21,329 --> 00:15:26,069
again no siloed data additionally Drupal

00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:28,110
accelerates your time to market for new

00:15:26,069 --> 00:15:30,089
marketing campaigns and empowers your

00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:32,640
marketing team to add new pages at a

00:15:30,089 --> 00:15:34,769
content and put web forms up independent

00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,610
of an engine engineering team you know

00:15:34,769 --> 00:15:37,950
that's the

00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:40,560
the beauty of Drupal create a landing

00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:43,649
page if you're using you know panels or

00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:46,649
panoply you can move that around you can

00:15:43,649 --> 00:15:48,779
you know have configurations and edit

00:15:46,649 --> 00:15:51,060
that a little bit without having to call

00:15:48,779 --> 00:15:53,940
an ITC a marketing department can do

00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:55,170
that just be just as easy and

00:15:53,940 --> 00:16:00,959
additionally you know they can be

00:15:55,170 --> 00:16:04,350
automatically linked to your tools and

00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:06,320
then once you have them you want to

00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:09,360
convert them you want to crease loyalty

00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:10,920
your data annum and analytics can really

00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:14,010
help increase your conversion rates the

00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:15,750
potential customers or you know

00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:18,360
potential users well who is using them

00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:20,519
or what pages they're on google

00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:23,279
analytics can easily be implemented on

00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:27,029
your site just wet ads your web property

00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:29,130
ID to the admin configuration screen and

00:16:27,029 --> 00:16:30,750
then once you have a new customer their

00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:33,060
user account information can

00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:35,910
automatically be sent to your ERP or

00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:38,750
your sales fulfillment system and then

00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:41,910
you can start engaging them with

00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:43,980
gamification you know janrain the tool

00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:46,980
we use a lot that's for personalized

00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:48,660
content based on their user profile and

00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:52,050
that can help you really increase repeat

00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:53,310
business and brand advocacy so like I

00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:56,870
said these are really all automated

00:16:53,310 --> 00:17:00,660
steps so you're not doing any extra work

00:16:56,870 --> 00:17:04,890
from the back end is a site admin or the

00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:06,600
marketing team or the HR team Drupal can

00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:08,579
really feed the necessary information to

00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:14,160
these platforms but these are all

00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:16,110
one-way communications Drupal can really

00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:19,199
help you improve your internal

00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:21,540
operations and processes but it's great

00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:23,850
because it offers simplicity at I guess

00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:25,799
both ends of the spectrum so if an easy

00:17:23,850 --> 00:17:29,190
problem I just ran through a few quick

00:17:25,799 --> 00:17:32,490
fixes modules drop in some you know

00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:35,400
simple code there and that will give you

00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:38,160
a quick win but for large complex issues

00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:41,340
for say an enterprise class organization

00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:44,280
or website drupal again is very

00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:48,110
extensible and can do a lot more than

00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:49,190
just be a front-end CMS my team is doing

00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:51,700
probably

00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:54,590
seventy-five percent of our projects are

00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:58,430
heavy heavy integration work and where

00:17:54,590 --> 00:18:01,220
drupal is being used less as a website

00:17:58,430 --> 00:18:03,290
what as a CMS and more as sort of this

00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:06,140
hub for your data and your disparate

00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:08,330
sources and more technical problems like

00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:09,710
that usually require that require

00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:13,220
anything more than one way communication

00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:15,230
they typically seek out teams you can go

00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:17,420
to the Dido marketplace and there's you

00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:20,720
know tons and tons of vendors out there

00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:23,870
just like achieve so I'm going to go

00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:25,910
over now to real-world case studies on

00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:30,280
how we help enterprise clients with

00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:30,280
really large scale technical solutions

00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:39,440
so one of our larger clients is

00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:41,750
advanstar communications and they

00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:44,420
operate and manage worldwide trade shows

00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:46,700
and conferences as well as show specific

00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:49,160
advertising and publications so they put

00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:50,870
out two of the the two largest fashion

00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:53,540
trade shows in North America which is

00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:56,180
Magic market week in Las Vegas every

00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:58,010
year has 85 thousand attendees from more

00:18:56,180 --> 00:19:01,010
than 80 countries so they manage and

00:18:58,010 --> 00:19:04,340
operate booth space for 134 different

00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:07,100
trade shows and they so they need to

00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:09,260
basically sell that space to their

00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:12,560
clients and their vendors that want to

00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:16,040
you know come and present at these trade

00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:17,840
shows and they had when they came to us

00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:19,880
they had a paper only order and

00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:23,060
fulfillment process that was really

00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:25,970
grinding their operations to a halt so

00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:27,830
when I say paper only I mean that when

00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:29,870
you wanted to order booth space as you

00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:32,060
if you were a customer of theirs you had

00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:33,830
to fill out an order form and mail or

00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:35,810
fax it to their sales and account team

00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:37,670
and then they've manually input that

00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:40,670
data into Salesforce so they were really

00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:43,490
looking for a way to extend they had a

00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:45,620
huge sales force I'd for their sales

00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:48,470
team but they didn't have any way to get

00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:50,750
that information to the user and we see

00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:53,060
this all the time you know Salesforce is

00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:55,700
too inflexible no one really wants to

00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:57,560
look at that you know you I on the

00:19:55,700 --> 00:20:00,170
internal side you don't really want to

00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:02,540
present that to the client because it's

00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:06,500
not very intuitive it's not

00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:08,540
it's not pretty if you will so manual

00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:10,520
sales process is really inefficient

00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:14,120
things were getting lost in the mail

00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:16,010
obviously made you know double redundant

00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:18,680
workflows and additionally there was a

00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:21,920
lot of miscommunications so there were

00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:24,080
errors on the final orders due to sort

00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:25,670
of this paper process they were bruised

00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:27,950
there was a lot of hand notes written

00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:30,110
all over the order process and chicken

00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:33,140
scratch and so when people were entering

00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:35,810
it into Salesforce there was again they

00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:40,550
were you know either duplicating or

00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:42,740
missing something so this time caused

00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:44,600
big issues because just think about

00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:48,410
going to one of the largest fashion

00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:50,300
trade shows in the world and someone's

00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:53,390
got their booth wrong and there's

00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:55,130
different vendors already set up and you

00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:57,920
have to change and move things around

00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:59,600
you have to you know it's a whole big

00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:00,800
headache and they finally you know

00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:03,680
through their hands up in the air and

00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:05,960
Siddharth we need a solution and that's

00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:08,960
why they came to us for a digital a

00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:10,460
digital solution they were eventually

00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:14,060
they were thinking about using

00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:16,490
Salesforce in isolation the complex

00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:18,920
booth registration process made it less

00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:20,660
effective due to their platform

00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:23,180
integration which caused this cumbersome

00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:25,430
workflow with a huge overhead from

00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:28,370
Salesforce licensing fees they were

00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:32,120
looking at around 750 k alone just on

00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:33,320
the licensing and if Salesforce didn't

00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:34,640
know if it was going to get them what

00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:36,800
they needed it was probably going to get

00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:39,320
them eighty percent of the way there and

00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:43,520
that didn't include any customization so

00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:46,040
very big problem there but then we said

00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:48,770
well instead of using Salesforce in

00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:50,540
isolation let's utilize the flexibility

00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:53,300
of Drupal let's achieve a sort of this

00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:55,310
streamlined platform that was far more

00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:57,860
cost-effective than the standalone

00:21:55,310 --> 00:22:01,010
Salesforce route so we digitize the

00:21:57,860 --> 00:22:03,830
sales process but we kept Salesforce on

00:22:01,010 --> 00:22:06,770
their on their sales side so the sales

00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:09,200
team didn't have to re use or relearn a

00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:11,540
new system but what we presented to the

00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:13,540
client was a multi-step shopping cart

00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:16,400
where you can select your booth space

00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:19,400
this image is a little small bit

00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:22,430
you can select what size you can select

00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:25,880
you know what layout you want for your

00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:28,010
space and then it's a so it's a

00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:30,790
multi-step shopping cart but what's

00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:32,690
great is that information is

00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:35,860
continuously synchronized with

00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:40,610
Salesforce and tied into the workflow of

00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:42,410
the of avin stars sales team so a user

00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:44,930
comes to the site says i'm going to

00:22:42,410 --> 00:22:47,300
count they become a lead and a sales

00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:49,520
team is notified a user starts shopping

00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:52,310
and they select a package they become an

00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:55,370
opportunity sales team then contact them

00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:57,770
or pushes info back saying yes this

00:22:55,370 --> 00:22:59,690
booth is available and there's a

00:22:57,770 --> 00:23:01,310
communication there that's all digital

00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:04,220
so the sales team doesn't have to go

00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:06,200
into the drool back in again download

00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:09,770
sort of the csv file and upload it to

00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:14,000
salesforce it's just all done you know

00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:15,650
synchronized synchronized so and

00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,620
additionally this was a great UX for the

00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:22,970
customer so we really turn this into

00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:27,650
this you know slick customer shopping

00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:31,610
cart so what was interesting the client

00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:33,410
said to us that their customers actually

00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:35,300
ended up up selling themselves because

00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:38,230
they had a lot more options available to

00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:41,000
them at their fingertips so they had a

00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:43,100
large increase in sales just due to that

00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,840
because the sales people in the paper

00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:47,450
only days were only selling what they

00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:50,000
knew whereas the customer here they were

00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:51,890
just up selling themselves because you

00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:55,040
know they could add new lighting options

00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:58,280
new carpeting new you know cool new

00:23:55,040 --> 00:24:01,850
features and they also had more control

00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:03,830
over billing so there were no uniform

00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:06,170
discounts it turned out that everyone

00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:08,540
was getting a discount so again this

00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:10,640
helped the managers have further insight

00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:13,160
into the process and the automation

00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:15,830
drastically improved efficiencies so

00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:18,620
that was one tool worry where we were we

00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:23,440
were able to really get more from

00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:23,440
Salesforce by by leveraging Drupal and

00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:32,179
then another one of our clients is

00:24:29,309 --> 00:24:35,309
Dexcom they are a medical device

00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:37,799
manufacturer and they they have

00:24:35,309 --> 00:24:41,970
continuous glucose monitoring devices so

00:24:37,799 --> 00:24:44,970
for diabetes patients they're really

00:24:41,970 --> 00:24:46,649
really awesome company they operate

00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:49,669
obviously in the sort of biotech

00:24:46,649 --> 00:24:53,700
industry and they had an even more

00:24:49,669 --> 00:24:55,860
cumbersome order process sort of in part

00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:57,870
due to their tight industry regulations

00:24:55,860 --> 00:25:00,240
they they're dealing with sensitive

00:24:57,870 --> 00:25:03,899
patient information so they're dealing

00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:05,249
under HIPAA regulations and additionally

00:25:03,899 --> 00:25:08,580
they were dependent on their Oracle

00:25:05,249 --> 00:25:10,259
legacy system so the oracle system was

00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:12,480
not flexible enough to give them what

00:25:10,259 --> 00:25:15,509
they really needed which was a secure

00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:19,830
ecommerce solution to expedite patient

00:25:15,509 --> 00:25:22,340
reorder process so inefficient sales

00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:24,840
process this one would be the definition

00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:27,749
before we implemented the solution it

00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:30,629
was extremely housed outdated slow and

00:25:27,749 --> 00:25:34,289
efficient they used the mail and phone

00:25:30,629 --> 00:25:36,330
communications because they were dealing

00:25:34,289 --> 00:25:38,220
with the sensitive information the

00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:41,789
sensitive patient information and the

00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:45,149
Dexcom IT team just didn't know how to

00:25:41,789 --> 00:25:48,570
get this information out to the to the

00:25:45,149 --> 00:25:52,559
customers without violating you know

00:25:48,570 --> 00:25:56,369
these HIPAA regulations so customers

00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:58,499
then had to find ex-con themselves call

00:25:56,369 --> 00:26:00,659
a service rep and then the service rep

00:25:58,499 --> 00:26:02,669
would send them a patient order form

00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:04,590
that takes about two to three days to

00:26:02,669 --> 00:26:06,480
get to the customer in one to two days

00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:08,970
for the customer to fill it out send it

00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:10,769
back and then Dexcom would take it and

00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:13,080
send that to their corresponding

00:26:10,769 --> 00:26:15,119
insurance provider to look up the price

00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:17,490
so based on your insurance your level of

00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:20,519
insurance and and your insurance

00:26:17,490 --> 00:26:24,539
provider you pay a difference you pay a

00:26:20,519 --> 00:26:25,999
different amount for your device so so

00:26:24,539 --> 00:26:29,039
then they would get that information

00:26:25,999 --> 00:26:31,799
send the order form back to the patient

00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:34,049
or the customer and it would say you

00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:35,909
know your device is going to cost this

00:26:34,049 --> 00:26:37,500
much how many do you want so the

00:26:35,909 --> 00:26:39,809
customers make the final purchasing

00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:42,450
decision the order is fulfilled and sent

00:26:39,809 --> 00:26:43,200
to the customer we're talking about two

00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:46,429
weeks here

00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:48,630
and in some cases you know these are

00:26:46,429 --> 00:26:51,600
diabetes monitoring devices so they can

00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:54,149
be in certain cases critical and

00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:56,159
life-saving and that's too long it was

00:26:54,149 --> 00:26:58,110
taking two weeks additionally with all

00:26:56,159 --> 00:27:00,960
the moving parts you know there was in

00:26:58,110 --> 00:27:04,380
efficiencies lost orders missed orders

00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:07,320
and huge issues on the sales side and

00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:09,299
the managing side so they really needed

00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:11,940
a way to speed the sales process up and

00:27:09,299 --> 00:27:13,590
make it more efficient and increase the

00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:17,000
user experience because this is a

00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:21,120
customer is a terrible user experience

00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:22,710
so we built them so we helped extend we

00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:25,409
really helped extend an oracle system

00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:28,649
because again it was too inflexible and

00:27:25,409 --> 00:27:30,120
they were considering getting a new ERP

00:27:28,649 --> 00:27:33,000
which would have been millions in IT

00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:34,889
disruption and they had no idea if that

00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:37,769
new ERP system was going to get them

00:27:34,889 --> 00:27:40,740
what they needed so we really were able

00:27:37,769 --> 00:27:43,590
to pull data out of Oracle through web

00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:46,429
services and leave all that stuff locked

00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:50,120
behind the their HIPAA environment and

00:27:46,429 --> 00:27:53,720
surface it on a drupal commerce

00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:57,149
responsive site so it's a very quick

00:27:53,720 --> 00:28:00,899
efficient very great looking reorder

00:27:57,149 --> 00:28:02,340
process so our architects looked at it

00:28:00,899 --> 00:28:05,130
and said well why can't the order

00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:08,250
process be like Amazon you know they

00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:10,409
they had the security in the back of

00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:14,240
their mind but they said okay let's make

00:28:10,409 --> 00:28:19,649
it secure but let's make it like Amazon

00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:22,500
so they built this great store that you

00:28:19,649 --> 00:28:25,529
log in as a user so it's all behind the

00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:28,649
fire all behind a firewall all you know

00:28:25,529 --> 00:28:32,700
a ssl secured so you log in as a user

00:28:28,649 --> 00:28:36,750
and as you create your user profile it

00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:39,120
looks up it looks up your insurance in

00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:40,889
the dexcom Oracle database which is

00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:43,559
where all the patient information is

00:28:40,889 --> 00:28:46,860
stored and then surfaces all your

00:28:43,559 --> 00:28:51,179
information and you see a different

00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:53,190
price than John Doe sees or then you

00:28:51,179 --> 00:28:54,690
know someone else sees when they log in

00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:55,250
because their insurance rates are

00:28:54,690 --> 00:28:57,320
different

00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:59,990
so when you log it or you can't log in

00:28:57,320 --> 00:29:02,420
now unless you are a set up an account

00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:05,990
but if you go to the site now you won't

00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:08,510
see any prices on the devices that was

00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:11,410
done because the prices again are

00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:14,890
different per user so when you log in it

00:29:11,410 --> 00:29:17,930
populates all the data with your

00:29:14,890 --> 00:29:21,800
specified insurance rate and then it

00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:24,260
will give you the price you pay for for

00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:26,240
your device so that increased reorders

00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:29,690
by about three hundred percent just

00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:31,970
because it took one hour to do a reorder

00:29:29,690 --> 00:29:36,230
then it took as opposed to like three

00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:39,680
weeks again you know a new order was

00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:43,790
just as it was just a streamlined so

00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:46,010
this really really helped extend their

00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:48,890
functionality of the oracle system by

00:29:46,010 --> 00:29:50,720
using drupal and tying tying the two

00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:53,120
systems very tightly together and

00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:56,300
surfacing all that data in a very

00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:58,850
user-friendly way by you with a drupal

00:29:56,300 --> 00:30:00,860
commerce site it reduce their overall

00:29:58,850 --> 00:30:03,530
cost of sales and increase their

00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:06,110
reorders exponentially and additionally

00:30:03,530 --> 00:30:15,380
you know it's saved a lot by not having

00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:17,300
them switch a new IT system so as I

00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:19,340
highlighted Drupal can really help you

00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:21,410
increase your company wide efficiencies

00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:23,690
it can increase your revenue and

00:30:21,410 --> 00:30:26,570
separate you from your company and your

00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:28,130
company from the competition so really

00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:29,960
the message don't settle for eighty

00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:33,110
percent that your current platforms are

00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:35,300
giving you or limiting you to you really

00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:37,490
should demand more and get one hundred

00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:39,620
percent that you're paying for to move

00:30:37,490 --> 00:30:41,600
your initiatives forward and you can do

00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:44,060
that with a tightly integrated solution

00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:49,820
between your platforms and your drupal

00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:51,890
CMS so in conclusion when leverage

00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:53,810
properly Drupal can be used to bridge

00:30:51,890 --> 00:30:56,000
the gap and extend your current

00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:57,950
platforms and their functionality to

00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,730
help move you forward and at a fraction

00:30:57,950 --> 00:31:04,040
of the cost because of the open source

00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:05,810
the beauty of open source so there are

00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:07,880
quick fixes that I highlighted you can

00:31:05,810 --> 00:31:08,809
implement right away you know but if you

00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:10,580
have more complex

00:31:08,809 --> 00:31:12,919
issues they usually require a more

00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:14,960
advanced solution and you should seek

00:31:12,919 --> 00:31:17,120
