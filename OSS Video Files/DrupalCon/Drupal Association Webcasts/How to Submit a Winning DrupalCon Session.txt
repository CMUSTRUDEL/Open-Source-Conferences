webinar and send the recording out to

00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:31,680
everyone along with the slides you're

00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:34,470
going to see there's just a joke full of

00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,869
information in here with links that give

00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:38,310
you all the source information and so

00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:39,720
it's going to be helpful I think for you

00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:44,759
to have these slides and so I'll send

00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:46,890
that out to you right after the call so

00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:49,649
today for an agenda we're going to cover

00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:52,850
a couple areas we're going to talk about

00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:56,369
what is the session selection process

00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:59,700
how to write a winning abstract and i

00:01:56,369 --> 00:02:02,040
have some special tips for sponsors and

00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:04,110
then i want to take a closer look at

00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:06,270
drupalcon New Orleans and the tracks

00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:07,799
that are available and the types of

00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:09,750
content that the track shares are

00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:12,599
looking for and then we'll talk about

00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:13,830
how you can just pass go and bypass that

00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:16,260
community process

00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:18,540
if you just are you you can buy a

00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:21,090
session and get on stage in a different

00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:23,460
way they're all great options and i'll

00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:25,980
cover all of them hey megan we've had a

00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:28,110
request come in to use presenter mode so

00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:30,530
it's a little bigger on screen sure I

00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:30,530
can do that

00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:42,630
great hopefully that's better thank you

00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:44,880
good okay so diving into about the

00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:46,350
session selection so you can see for

00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:48,240
anyone that hasn't been to a drupalcon

00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:50,550
this is what a typical session room

00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:54,000
looks like and get a podium at the front

00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:57,180
and some support from tech and off you

00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,230
go with your slides so drupalcon

00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:04,950
norland's will be the first opportunity

00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:08,310
for submitting your abstract the event

00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:09,870
is from a 9th to the 13th and that

00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:13,020
Monday is when we hold training in

00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:15,180
summits Tuesday through Thursday is when

00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:18,090
we have keynotes and sessions so this is

00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:20,640
when your sessions would be running we

00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:22,740
do have sprints on Friday where the

00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:25,770
community comes together and works on

00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:28,580
the project for triple crown Orleans the

00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:31,410
call for papers closes februari 29th at

00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:33,750
right before midnight New Orleans local

00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:36,570
time that's really important because we

00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:37,950
don't accept late submissions and I'm

00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:40,200
going to encourage everyone to get

00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:42,000
started on this process of creating your

00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,920
abstract as soon as we get off the call

00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,930
let's take advantage of the whole month

00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:49,500
we have lots of resources that will help

00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:51,510
you the sessions as I mentioned there's

00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:53,550
community selected sessions and there

00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:58,680
are paid sessions so i'll go through

00:03:53,550 --> 00:04:00,989
both both options so i want to focus on

00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:03,870
the community selected sessions first

00:04:00,989 --> 00:04:06,989
because that is where the local the

00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:11,400
opportunities are so we have 13 tracks

00:04:06,989 --> 00:04:14,160
in total and each track has so many

00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:17,609
sessions associated with it they combine

00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:21,180
2 143 sessions so I kind of just gives

00:04:17,609 --> 00:04:22,860
you a scope of how many how many

00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:26,610
there are there's a lot of people that

00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:28,800
submit so sessions are 60 minutes long

00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:31,860
and we do record them and post them up

00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:34,880
on YouTube where they get thousands of

00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:37,229
more views from people around the world

00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:39,810
we have different formats that you can

00:04:37,229 --> 00:04:42,360
use you can present a loan you can co

00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:44,440
present with another expert or you can

00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:46,780
host a panel

00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:51,300
and we do offer speakers a free ticket

00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:51,300
to drupalcon one speaker per session I

00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:57,220
want to call out that our session

00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:59,740
selection process is run by the

00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:03,940
community if you have a staff member

00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:06,850
named Amanda ganzer who project manages

00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:08,470
this whole session selection process but

00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:11,410
the ones that are the real experts

00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:13,060
picking the tracks and the session

00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:15,250
themes and the actual sessions are

00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:17,830
community members and they do it purely

00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:19,960
as a volunteer service we have two to

00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:23,170
three volunteers assigned to each track

00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:25,780
and they are experts in that tracks

00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:28,830
focus they are the ones that define the

00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:30,880
themes they decide what are the kinds of

00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:32,410
content that our community needs to be

00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,180
educated on so they are the ones

00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:37,000
identify the types of sessions that we

00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:38,710
need to talk about and as they go

00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,320
through this process they receive over

00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:44,140
500 sessions so that's a ton of volume

00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:45,900
to go through as volunteers and it's

00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:48,820
also important for you to understand how

00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:50,740
many sessions submissions we receive

00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:52,540
knowing that we only have 140 three

00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:54,850
slots to fill so it's a lot of

00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:56,080
competition out there which is why it's

00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:59,830
really important to know how to write

00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:02,860
that winning abstract so when the

00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:05,470
volunteers receive all these 500 plus

00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:07,570
session submissions they have two weeks

00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:10,330
to go through them all they rank them

00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:12,430
and they select sessions if you're

00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:14,110
looking for more in-depth explanations I

00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:17,360
did provide this link which you'll

00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:20,479
receive when you get the slides

00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:23,060
but it's obviously a pretty big job but

00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:26,000
it's really great to have a Drupal

00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:29,930
experts in charge of picking the triple

00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:32,150
content and so I want to drill into some

00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:33,650
pro tips on how you can get your session

00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:35,780
selected and this is kind of like

00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:38,659
generic this is for anyone whether a

00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:42,620
sponsor or not a sponsor these are all

00:06:38,659 --> 00:06:46,520
important tips to follow so one of the

00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:49,580
first things is who you are as a as a

00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:51,469
session submitter matters the trackers

00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:55,069
are looking for speakers who have proven

00:06:51,469 --> 00:06:56,900
speaker experience and that they are

00:06:55,069 --> 00:06:59,750
known in the Drupal community as an

00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:02,960
expert and so speaking at camps it's

00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:05,300
showing that you have spoken to camps is

00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:07,129
a good way to demonstrate this maybe

00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:10,159
you've spoken at other conferences other

00:07:07,129 --> 00:07:13,550
industry events be great to highlight

00:07:10,159 --> 00:07:14,990
that in your submission we'll talk a

00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:16,189
little bit more about this if you are

00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:17,840
not known in the Drupal community

00:07:16,189 --> 00:07:21,069
because maybe you work for a software

00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:23,509
vendor or you work for a hosting company

00:07:21,069 --> 00:07:25,069
but you have a lot of speaking

00:07:23,509 --> 00:07:26,810
experience in Drupal knowledge you just

00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:29,060
maybe haven't gone to a camp yet so

00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:33,650
we'll talk about how to work through

00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:38,210
that the reason I encourage you to start

00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:40,279
the writing process now is that you want

00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:42,800
to go through a kind of an editing

00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:44,629
process and really use the next couple

00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,539
weeks before the deadline to get

00:07:44,629 --> 00:07:49,279
feedback from different people the first

00:07:47,539 --> 00:07:51,229
thing you want to do is you want to go

00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:53,150
to the event site and you want to read

00:07:51,229 --> 00:07:56,599
about the different tracks that we offer

00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:58,669
in the in the truck chairs put on the

00:07:56,599 --> 00:08:00,139
pages what kinds of sessions that are

00:07:58,669 --> 00:08:02,229
looking for so they're very clear about

00:08:00,139 --> 00:08:04,430
the kind of content that they want and

00:08:02,229 --> 00:08:05,779
so I have a link here that takes you

00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:08,599
right to all the tracks and we're going

00:08:05,779 --> 00:08:12,349
to go through that at a high level later

00:08:08,599 --> 00:08:15,080
on in the presentation the track chairs

00:08:12,349 --> 00:08:17,889
are also there to answer your questions

00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:19,879
so if you see a track and the session

00:08:17,889 --> 00:08:21,680
descriptions that they're looking for

00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:23,719
you might still have some questions of

00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:26,089
this is a good idea or how can I make

00:08:23,719 --> 00:08:28,310
this idea better the track chairs want

00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:31,000
to hear from you so reach out to them

00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:33,310
right away and get their feedback

00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,650
again i have a link in here that will

00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:40,240
take you right to the page that has a

00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:42,820
way for you to contact them and as

00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,500
you're writing you want to make sure

00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:48,180
you're telling a story something that

00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:50,350
really will resonate with your audience

00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:52,630
you definitely don't want to do pitches

00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:53,950
so if you know software vendor or

00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:57,670
hosting company don't just talk about

00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:59,770
your software I think Drupal shops those

00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:02,440
are those of you that are on the line

00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:05,350
know this already but you really want to

00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:07,030
say like what is the problem and what is

00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:09,130
the solution and do it in a way that's

00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:13,090
telling a story and make sure that you

00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:16,330
are really clear in your abstract who

00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:18,490
this session is for is it for a

00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:21,010
technical audience a beginner technical

00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:26,020
audience and what are the takeaways were

00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:27,580
they going to learn from you and then

00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:29,820
just make sure it's proof read like

00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:32,350
anything you know quality matters and

00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:33,820
there are a few other tips but those are

00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:35,950
some of the really important ones I

00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:38,080
wanted to call out but if you go to this

00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:44,380
link you'll see there's some other

00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:46,930
really good ideas to to follow and so as

00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:48,370
you write up your abstract and hopefully

00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:51,430
talk to the track chairs to get some

00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:54,370
ideas you can go to other experts out

00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:56,440
there ask them for feedback you can even

00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:58,000
ask your account manager if someone at

00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:01,030
the drupal association can give you

00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,830
feedback our CTO Josh Mitchell has

00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:05,200
offered this before in the past of

00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:07,589
people and then when you're ready to

00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,670
submit go ahead and post this online and

00:10:07,589 --> 00:10:12,190
this is another reason why you want do

00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:13,839
this want to submit sooner than later is

00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:15,700
that the community is going to give you

00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:18,790
feedback and if they start asking

00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:20,589
questions or you get something that mmm

00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:24,160
you might want to drill into you have a

00:10:20,589 --> 00:10:28,600
chance to go and edit your abstract and

00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:30,339
improve it before the deadline so again

00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:32,380
when you do submit make sure you submit

00:10:30,339 --> 00:10:34,540
on time we don't have exceptions for

00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:38,230
late submissions and the link I provided

00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:41,100
here is just the link to where you go to

00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:41,100
submit your session

00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:47,360
so I'm going to go out

00:10:45,459 --> 00:10:49,490
presentation boat oh I think it works

00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:53,209
great I want to show you an example of a

00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:55,069
winning abstract and I'm sorry Amanda

00:10:53,209 --> 00:10:58,430
couldn't be here she's actually in India

00:10:55,069 --> 00:11:00,529
setting up drupalcon Asia but she said

00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:04,459
this was a really good example of an

00:11:00,529 --> 00:11:07,040
abstract that you should look to so this

00:11:04,459 --> 00:11:09,439
is was provided the session was called

00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:12,259
front to end ops and the reason it's

00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:15,980
great is that the first thing that it

00:11:12,259 --> 00:11:19,069
talks about is the problem question you

00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:21,470
know it talks about how websites need to

00:11:19,069 --> 00:11:23,899
be fast and how front end is most often

00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:25,670
the real bottleneck and the question is

00:11:23,899 --> 00:11:27,430
how do you keep things humming and get

00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:29,959
all of your work done at the same time

00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:31,790
right so this is just a problem that can

00:11:29,959 --> 00:11:35,000
resonate with people in the front

00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:38,300
end-front end developers and then it

00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,970
goes into the real solution is front and

00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:42,759
ups it talks about what front end ops is

00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:45,560
and how the session is going to cover it

00:11:42,759 --> 00:11:49,759
and what you're going to learn from this

00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:52,550
session it goes into how who the session

00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:55,120
is for and that it's going to be

00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:57,949
technical in nature and it tells it

00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:59,720
explains what the attendees will need to

00:11:57,949 --> 00:12:04,370
know to have a good foundation to

00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:07,939
understand this talk additionally this

00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:10,130
presenter provided slides and examples

00:12:07,939 --> 00:12:11,899
of past speaking opportunities around

00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:14,139
this topic so that you could see they

00:12:11,899 --> 00:12:18,170
are an expert and we're good speakers

00:12:14,139 --> 00:12:21,439
and so it's very tight and was really

00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:23,449
well received you could even see that

00:12:21,439 --> 00:12:25,579
they were common it's added when it was

00:12:23,449 --> 00:12:27,709
submitted it was considered cool and

00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:29,509
looks great and ah this is the nerdy

00:12:27,709 --> 00:12:31,130
 so if you get those kinds of

00:12:29,509 --> 00:12:32,540
comments you know you're in really good

00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:34,639
shape but maybe you're going to have

00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:36,230
comments that say what about this what

00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:39,290
about that and that's where you can go

00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:41,620
back in and make some tweaks to make it

00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:41,620
stronger

00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:50,540
so in short just make sure it has the

00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:53,410
who what where when why of writing I'm

00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:53,410
going to switch back over

00:12:57,170 --> 00:13:01,920
so there are some special things I want

00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:08,100
to crawl out for sponsors when you are

00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:10,470
writing your abstract so I mentioned

00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:12,779
that the track chairs are looking for

00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:15,089
experts specifically those that are

00:13:12,779 --> 00:13:17,329
known in the Drupal community and like I

00:13:15,089 --> 00:13:19,860
said maybe were for a software company

00:13:17,329 --> 00:13:23,040
that has an integration with Drupal

00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:28,130
maybe you're hosting service that's used

00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:32,070
often to power Drupal sites and we

00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:34,019
certainly don't want to lose an

00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:37,050
opportunity because you're not known in

00:13:34,019 --> 00:13:39,750
the Drupal community so if you haven't

00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:42,570
been doing talks at camps and things

00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:45,930
like that that is okay what we do

00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:47,269
recommend is that you partner with

00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:50,399
someone that's known in the community

00:13:47,269 --> 00:13:52,709
maybe it's your Drupal customer maybe

00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:55,490
it's someone a triple shop that's done

00:13:52,709 --> 00:13:58,199
an implementation with your module

00:13:55,490 --> 00:14:01,230
there's lots of ways to partner and to

00:13:58,199 --> 00:14:05,279
have a really strong speaking team and

00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:07,649
and so if you don't know how to find

00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:09,240
those people I do recommend you reach

00:14:07,649 --> 00:14:11,699
out to your account manager we have a

00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:14,399
program called partner connect where we

00:14:11,699 --> 00:14:16,139
can do some research kind of understand

00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:18,060
what you're trying to achieve and you

00:14:16,139 --> 00:14:20,940
would make a really strong co-presenter

00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:25,380
with you and we'll do the introductions

00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:27,240
to that person and you help you see if

00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:28,529
there's any well any they're there if

00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,970
they would like to cope resent with you

00:14:28,529 --> 00:14:34,500
and what that story would be that you

00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:36,750
want to share together and so i have a

00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:38,519
link in here about partner connect it's

00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:40,350
a super lightweight program but it's

00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:41,519
really just a service to can help you

00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:44,430
connect with the right people in the

00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:50,399
community and expands much much further

00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:53,930
than just drupalcon there was one other

00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:53,930
thing I wanted to point out to you is

00:14:54,019 --> 00:15:00,060
when you are as a sponsor especially a

00:14:57,779 --> 00:15:01,829
software vendor or hosting company just

00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:04,800
again you want to make sure you're it's

00:15:01,829 --> 00:15:07,589
not a pitch you want to tell a story and

00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:10,410
what I recommend is a case study so this

00:15:07,589 --> 00:15:13,740
is again where it'd be great if you have

00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:15,959
a joint customer maybe you could bring

00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:19,709
in that joint customer to tell the story

00:15:15,959 --> 00:15:22,259
with you you can work with a developer

00:15:19,709 --> 00:15:24,810
that implemented a solution for a client

00:15:22,259 --> 00:15:26,639
and have them come in with you but it's

00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:29,639
really important that you tell a story

00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:31,829
that will resonate and educate and i

00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:35,459
would say un tell a case study about

00:15:31,829 --> 00:15:38,310
what the clients problem was how you and

00:15:35,459 --> 00:15:42,000
your your service or product along with

00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:44,009
drupal solved that pain point and then

00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,139
you can drill in as you need to if you

00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:49,110
need to talk about that specific module

00:15:46,139 --> 00:15:51,360
and anything that might be a developer

00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:52,980
might want to know of you know you want

00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:55,079
to get away from demos but if the demo

00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:59,430
really does help your story make sure it

00:15:55,079 --> 00:16:01,350
is told or is shared within the context

00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:03,660
of a case study I think that's really

00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:05,430
important and again if you need some

00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:07,439
brainstorming ideas please reach out to

00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:11,639
the account managers reach out to me

00:16:07,439 --> 00:16:13,560
we're happy to help you brainstorm again

00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:16,529
we've had a question come in here asking

00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:17,759
during submitting the abstract they want

00:16:16,529 --> 00:16:20,250
to know whether the slides are mandatory

00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:23,699
or can they be added after the session

00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:25,800
is submitted you can add anything after

00:16:23,699 --> 00:16:31,050
the sessions submitted I would you know

00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:33,060
you just has to be there before the

00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:34,740
deadline because once the deadline

00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:36,750
passes everything's locked down and that

00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:40,740
whatever you've provided is what is

00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:42,870
being reviewed by the track chairs great

00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:44,790
thank you and we've had one more come in

00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:47,130
asking if we've considered ways to

00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:49,230
involve the greater community aside from

00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:51,180
just having experts to determine which

00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:53,610
submissions get selected oh that's a

00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:57,420
really good question we have

00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:59,459
historically used community members but

00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:02,509
we are reaching out for example the PHP

00:16:59,459 --> 00:17:06,750
track we are bringing in an expert from

00:17:02,509 --> 00:17:09,870
PHP architect so that is definitely

00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:11,939
someone from from the outside and i'll

00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:14,309
have to look to see if we are expanding

00:17:11,939 --> 00:17:17,459
that i do know we have a track provided

00:17:14,309 --> 00:17:20,819
by senseo labs and getting the symphony

00:17:17,459 --> 00:17:22,880
experts to come in to select content on

00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:24,170
that track but that's

00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:26,900
that's a really good question i'll look

00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:30,670
to see I think if I think it's always

00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:30,670
smart to bring in outside perspective

00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:40,310
great that's it so far okay good okay so

00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:44,780
drupalcon orleans the call for papers is

00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:47,510
open it closes februari 29th the track

00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:50,810
chairs have chosen their tracks and they

00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:54,710
have identified the types of sessions

00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:57,350
that they are looking for so these are

00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:59,330
the tracks it ranges from business

00:17:57,350 --> 00:18:02,620
coding and Development Corp

00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:06,950
conversations DevOps drupal.org

00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:11,440
front-end horizons PHP project

00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:14,900
management site building symphony and UX

00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:17,060
many of these apply to the audience

00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:19,160
today so I'm going to go over them at a

00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:22,010
high level these are the ones that are

00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:24,170
the community selected tracks we also

00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:27,530
have the sponsor track called business

00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:30,190
showcase I'm going to save that to the

00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:35,360
end this is a pretty straightforward

00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:38,810
path for that one so let's talk just a

00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:41,330
little bit about business tracks the

00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:43,070
business and strategy track is it is for

00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:45,830
Drupal shops but it's also for those

00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:48,500
that are in the digital experience

00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:51,590
business so it's for much more than just

00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:54,230
ripple shops these sessions are non

00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:56,450
technical in nature and the track chairs

00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:59,200
are looking for sessions that range from

00:18:56,450 --> 00:19:02,470
recruiting and hiring company culture

00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:05,930
sales and marketing digital strategy

00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:08,210
products and service offerings and the

00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:09,950
tractors are also looking for sessions

00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:13,010
that are going to share a real relevant

00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:14,840
experience that has a good you know good

00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:16,130
story driven narrative so they

00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:19,580
definitely are looking for these kinds

00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:22,160
of case studies and stories the best

00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:23,690
practices that you want to share they

00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:26,630
are definitely looking for ideas outside

00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:28,940
of the core Drupal ecosystem

00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:32,450
so if you have experience maybe working

00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:34,250
another company or you are company

00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:35,630
that's not in the Drupal community in

00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:38,210
the sense that you're a software vendor

00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:41,900
that serves many different communities

00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:43,430
you have a great perspective and so I

00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:45,500
think that you could really leverage

00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:48,620
that when you tell your story and submit

00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:50,660
a session in this area another thing to

00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:52,880
know about the business track as they

00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:56,150
are looking for sessions given by one to

00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:58,520
two people they prefer that over a panel

00:19:56,150 --> 00:20:00,440
so something to keep in mind again all

00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:03,680
this information and even more

00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:05,240
information is found on the the website

00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:06,020
and so you'll have links to all of that

00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:08,360
I'm just going to give you the

00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:10,880
highlights please note on the upper

00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:13,040
right hand corner the track leads I'll

00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:14,570
have the track leads here for each of

00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:15,950
the tracks i go over and again I just

00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:18,350
encourage you to reach out to them

00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:20,240
sooner than later to get some guidance

00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:26,000
on the on the session ideas that you

00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:29,630
have okay the next track is coding and

00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:31,850
development and well as you know Drupal

00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:34,100
8 is now released so the coding

00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:36,410
development track wants to definitely

00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:37,910
focus on Drupal 8 and specifically it

00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:40,070
wants to educate developers on the

00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:41,690
latest techniques and tools that are

00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:44,300
going to help developers make great

00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:46,370
projects track chairs are looking for

00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:48,920
sessions that cover best practices for

00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:51,650
coding and debugging and Drupal 8 Drupal

00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:54,170
migrations upgrading contribs to Drupal

00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:56,720
8 how to work with other frameworks and

00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:57,920
technologies and they're looking for

00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:00,700
shared experience around high

00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:04,220
performance and large-scale development

00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:11,000
so I'll apply some obvious candidates

00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:14,030
there the DevOps track well this is

00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,830
obviously a pretty popular topic and

00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:19,880
seeing a real rise and interest in this

00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:22,250
area the DevOps track chair is looking

00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:25,850
for sessions that cover a wide range of

00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:27,890
experiences associated with dev ops and

00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:30,410
they're also looking for people to share

00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:32,420
their experiences and implementing

00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:35,870
jayhawks so the knowledge and skills

00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:38,470
that people will need to know to to

00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:42,190
embrace DevOps in their organization

00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:44,260
so they want attendees to learn how how

00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:46,090
to help developers and operations work

00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:47,799
better together and that can range from

00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:49,929
automating processes to creating

00:21:47,799 --> 00:21:52,390
dashboards so there's just a lot that

00:21:49,929 --> 00:21:55,380
can be focused on here i think there's

00:21:52,390 --> 00:22:00,669
this is an area where if you're

00:21:55,380 --> 00:22:03,010
providing a third-party software that

00:22:00,669 --> 00:22:05,350
helps in dev ops this is a great place

00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:07,200
for you to educate our community if you

00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:09,250
are a drupal shop that's embraced this

00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:11,799
this is a great time to share your

00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:14,470
expertise and what may be moving to a

00:22:11,799 --> 00:22:16,120
DevOps practice looks like lots I think

00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:23,169
there's just a lot of room to educate

00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:25,900
the community here as a sponsor the next

00:22:23,169 --> 00:22:27,760
one is the front end track I showed you

00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:30,820
an example of a session from front end

00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:32,650
already but this year see the track

00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:34,600
chairs are looking for sessions that

00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:36,880
answer the question how can developers

00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:38,350
keep up and marry the best front end

00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:41,620
practices with the best of what Drupal

00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:43,000
offers that's nice and broad so

00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:44,919
specifically what they're looking for

00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,140
sessions that talk about the

00:22:44,919 --> 00:22:49,210
technologies and procedures that front

00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:51,610
end developers use today and that can

00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:53,520
range from preprocessors build

00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:56,140
automation javascript and CSS

00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:58,659
architecture new template systems and

00:22:56,140 --> 00:23:02,159
client-side applications and you know

00:22:58,659 --> 00:23:05,980
much more you know if you have

00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:08,440
experience around building a headless

00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:10,330
Drupal site this would be a great track

00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:12,580
for you to share I think everyone is

00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:14,080
really interested about this even just

00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:15,970
with Jesus recent blog post about

00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:17,679
headless Drupal there's just tons of

00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:24,370
energy here and people are very hungry

00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:28,990
for that topic horizons is a new track

00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:33,250
that we've just added to our selection

00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:34,659
of tracks and it's I think one that all

00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:38,559
of our sponsors have a way of

00:23:34,659 --> 00:23:40,929
contributing to it is designed to help

00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:44,140
us think big and to really look at the

00:23:40,929 --> 00:23:46,110
edges of Drupal and to talk about what

00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:49,539
that means so it's very

00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:51,850
interdisciplinary on track it's about

00:23:49,539 --> 00:23:55,870
big ideas that really just don't fit in

00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:58,240
all the other tracks really kind of

00:23:55,870 --> 00:24:00,610
forward and future focused so track

00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:03,610
chairs are looking for sessions that

00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:05,679
focus on things like where front end

00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:08,010
meets back in and where the publishing

00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:11,110
platform meets application framework and

00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:12,940
it also focuses on publishing content to

00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:17,850
a distributed decoupled multi-channel

00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:22,539
web so there's just lots of great

00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:26,289
opportunities here to share your ideas

00:24:22,539 --> 00:24:27,880
maybe you have even started testing in

00:24:26,289 --> 00:24:30,220
some of these areas and want to talk

00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:32,559
about that maybe you have gone to other

00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:34,630
industry events or seeing trends in the

00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:36,640
industry and would like to share that

00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:39,340
and explain where you think Drupal can

00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:41,650
fit in that I definitely see that with a

00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:44,140
kind of like Internet of Things and how

00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:47,200
Drupal can power the can publish the

00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:52,590
content behind that lots of lots of

00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:52,590
great opportunities here to to explore

00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:59,919
another track is the PHP track it's

00:24:57,850 --> 00:25:02,559
obviously pretty popular because of the

00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:05,080
Drupal 8 release this track is going to

00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:09,190
focus on making attendees better PHP

00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:12,370
developers because therefore they will

00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:14,110
be better Drupal developers the track

00:25:12,370 --> 00:25:16,480
shares are looking for intermediate to

00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:19,179
advanced sessions that obviously relate

00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:21,610
to PHP development software development

00:25:19,179 --> 00:25:24,610
as a whole rather than just Drupal

00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:27,280
specific and concepts and techniques

00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:29,590
that they want discussed here should

00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:34,150
reference Drupal use cases as much as

00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:37,360
possible so for those that have lots of

00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:39,490
experience in PHP or serving other PHP

00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:42,520
communities this is a great track for

00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:46,179
you to share your insights and kind of a

00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:47,830
break us out of the the Drupal echo

00:25:46,179 --> 00:25:53,620
chamber and just really expand our

00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:55,059
knowledge here another track is project

00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:56,049
management

00:25:55,059 --> 00:25:57,999
I think this one's pretty

00:25:56,049 --> 00:25:59,590
straightforward the track chairs are

00:25:57,999 --> 00:26:02,740
looking for sessions that focus on the

00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:06,100
practices principles and tools that help

00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:08,710
make projects run better and faster so

00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:10,899
session sessions should be tailored to

00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:12,669
project managers and directors scrum

00:26:10,899 --> 00:26:16,870
masters and other project management

00:26:12,669 --> 00:26:19,059
profiles I think that Drupal shops have

00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:21,100
tons of experience here can talk about

00:26:19,059 --> 00:26:22,929
what's worked what hasn't worked how

00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:26,019
they can scale business through really

00:26:22,929 --> 00:26:28,269
well managed projects I think that

00:26:26,019 --> 00:26:31,179
software vendors that offer project

00:26:28,269 --> 00:26:33,039
management tools can really share best

00:26:31,179 --> 00:26:34,119
practices obviously you don't want to

00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:37,149
talk about your tool and how that

00:26:34,119 --> 00:26:39,759
necessarily helps you can highlight that

00:26:37,149 --> 00:26:44,340
but you want to really talk about the

00:26:39,759 --> 00:26:44,340
best practices that your tools support

00:26:44,669 --> 00:26:48,220
you have a little multi-part question

00:26:46,629 --> 00:26:52,779
here that's come in if you have a moment

00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:54,129
okay sure all right so I someone's

00:26:52,779 --> 00:26:56,289
asking if you have any guidance about

00:26:54,129 --> 00:26:57,940
whether proposing a topic that addresses

00:26:56,289 --> 00:26:59,440
multiple tracks is a good thing or a bad

00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:01,059
thing in the eyes of the selection

00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:02,769
committee and they're wondering is it

00:27:01,059 --> 00:27:05,799
better to be super focused on a given

00:27:02,769 --> 00:27:09,070
track order evil as many track audiences

00:27:05,799 --> 00:27:13,690
as possible oh that's that's good to

00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:20,379
know um well let's see when you submit

00:27:13,690 --> 00:27:22,210
for a track I think you how do I go into

00:27:20,379 --> 00:27:23,590
the so if you submit for a track you

00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:27,070
want to be really clear who the audience

00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:30,399
is for so definitely be very specific

00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:32,049
don't try to go too broad don't write as

00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:34,629
if it could be accepted by multiple

00:27:32,049 --> 00:27:38,340
tracks what happens is if someone let's

00:27:34,629 --> 00:27:41,230
say you write for PHP the PHP track and

00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:42,730
the track lead says this is this is very

00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:45,159
good but it really actually doesn't fit

00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:48,009
mine it's much better for the code and

00:27:45,159 --> 00:27:50,679
developer track then that track chair

00:27:48,009 --> 00:27:52,509
will pass the submission over to the

00:27:50,679 --> 00:27:57,039
other track chair and say I'd like you

00:27:52,509 --> 00:27:59,440
to consider this one so I hopefully that

00:27:57,039 --> 00:28:00,999
answers part a and then Part B is it is

00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:04,330
absolutely fine to write as many

00:28:00,999 --> 00:28:06,519
submissions as you want again just be

00:28:04,330 --> 00:28:08,259
very clear that this is for this track

00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:08,630
and I'm covering this topic and it's for

00:28:08,259 --> 00:28:12,350
this

00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:15,020
audience and again if you have questions

00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:17,960
and maybe of multiple ideas for one

00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:19,820
specific track reach out to that track

00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:22,940
chair and they will give you guidance of

00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:30,100
the best way to submit great thanks man

00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:33,230
you bet okay so we're almost done um and

00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:34,670
again there's this is a lot of copy and

00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:36,230
I specifically put a lot of copy on

00:28:34,670 --> 00:28:39,650
these pages so that when I email it to

00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:42,380
you you can read them but they're also

00:28:39,650 --> 00:28:44,780
all on the website but the site builder

00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:48,320
track is I think well it may not be

00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:53,690
obvious for everyone um so we have a

00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:56,360
great you know a great line share of our

00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:58,490
attendees who are non technical and they

00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:59,840
build drupal websites that's one of the

00:28:58,490 --> 00:29:01,880
beautiful things about drupal's you

00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:03,710
don't need to be technical to put all

00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:06,350
the lego pieces together to create that

00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:08,660
amazing website but they do need

00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:11,690
training to know how to make the best

00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:16,840
website possible so track shares really

00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:20,630
are looking for sessions that can

00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:25,400
highlight different modules different

00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:28,910
ways to add features new ways to

00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:31,190
approach site building so best practices

00:29:28,910 --> 00:29:33,380
and I think this is a really I think

00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:35,690
every one of our sponsors can really

00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:37,730
contribute here so a Drupal shop

00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:39,620
obviously a lot of you are building

00:29:37,730 --> 00:29:40,960
modules for clients and contributing

00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:43,310
them back so you might want to highlight

00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:45,590
something that's really knew that a site

00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:49,580
builder should consider for their

00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:53,090
clients and if you are a software vendor

00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:54,950
with a integration to Drupal then you

00:29:53,090 --> 00:29:57,140
can highlight what's new with that

00:29:54,950 --> 00:30:00,440
module may be upgraded to Drupal 8 and

00:29:57,140 --> 00:30:02,690
it can help in a very specific way to

00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:04,430
solve a client's problems so I think

00:30:02,690 --> 00:30:06,110
this is an area where all of our

00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:10,130
sponsors should really consider

00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:11,900
submitting and then the last one I

00:30:10,130 --> 00:30:16,400
wanted to highlight is the user

00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:19,700
experience track so obviously this track

00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:21,140
is for UX practitioners the track chairs

00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:22,460
are looking for sessions that cover a

00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:26,540
whole range of

00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:28,760
topics from best practices for strategy

00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:33,500
and content creation although to design

00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:34,730
and development and so I'm trying to

00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:38,210
think what might apply most I think

00:30:34,730 --> 00:30:40,880
Drupal shops probably have the a lot of

00:30:38,210 --> 00:30:42,080
experience here best practices I think a

00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,940
case study of what you've done with a

00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:45,470
client what work maybe some pitfalls

00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:47,120
maybe all the things that didn't work

00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:52,700
and what to watch out for those would be

00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:55,480
some really good topics to cover here so

00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:57,710
those are the tracks for New Orleans

00:30:55,480 --> 00:31:00,560
that are managed by the community

00:30:57,710 --> 00:31:03,920
process and if there aren't other

00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:07,580
questions then I will just go to the

00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:11,060
last type of track which is our business

00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:14,990
showcase and that is the sponsored

00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:17,570
sessions we have a bit of a follow-up to

00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:20,570
the question about involving community

00:31:17,570 --> 00:31:22,790
in the selection process okay and it was

00:31:20,570 --> 00:31:25,730
more asking if the greater Drupal

00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:28,160
community IE conference attendees or

00:31:25,730 --> 00:31:32,050
everyone at the drupal.org account might

00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:35,900
be involved in the selection process oh

00:31:32,050 --> 00:31:38,660
no this is not a big community process

00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:44,260
that is the truck chairs who are

00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:44,260
deciding on which sessions get selected

00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,990
the tractors

00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:51,280
community members oh yes well they are

00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:57,040
community members right but we don't

00:31:51,280 --> 00:32:03,790
open it up for community boating okay

00:31:57,040 --> 00:32:05,560
thanks sure okay if there are not other

00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:08,350
questions then we'll just go into the

00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:10,540
business showcase so the business

00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:12,130
showcase is a track that runs throughout

00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:17,250
the whole conference at the same times

00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:20,140
as all the other sessions in the past a

00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:23,170
sponsor would be able to buy this by

00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:25,420
buying a sponsor package a diamond get

00:32:23,170 --> 00:32:27,310
60 minutes a platinum gets a 30 minute

00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:30,430
slot on the stage and gold would get a

00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:34,450
15 minute lightning talk any of our

00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:36,340
sponsors can level up and pay for

00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:39,310
additional time on the stage it's

00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:43,300
obviously the slots are limited so they

00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:46,660
do go quickly so that is a path that you

00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:48,100
want to take I recommend that you talk

00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:49,930
to your account manager right away

00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:54,280
because they are filling up there are a

00:32:49,930 --> 00:32:57,190
few slots left the one thing I want to

00:32:54,280 --> 00:33:00,790
point out is as you notice with all of

00:32:57,190 --> 00:33:03,610
the community tracks there is not a

00:33:00,790 --> 00:33:07,270
track for case studies which is really

00:33:03,610 --> 00:33:12,600
popular and is what our attendees really

00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:15,490
value and and it's great it's a great

00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:17,260
focus for our business showcase so we

00:33:15,490 --> 00:33:19,390
are asking anyone who speaks in the

00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:24,100
business showcase track to submit a case

00:33:19,390 --> 00:33:25,990
study it also will help sponsors really

00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:28,360
tell that story that we know resonates

00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:30,910
the best with our audience and will

00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:34,000
really attract people to come and listen

00:33:30,910 --> 00:33:35,680
to you listen to you speak so again if

00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,590
you don't want to go through the

00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:42,580
community process that's okay i highly

00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:44,680
recommend it um you can do that and buy

00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:46,180
a session but either way this is the

00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:47,620
path you'd like to go please talk to

00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:49,870
your account manager now or shoot me an

00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:54,930
email and we'll let you know what's

00:33:49,870 --> 00:33:57,990
available so

00:33:54,930 --> 00:34:00,170
that's it in a nutshell just to

00:33:57,990 --> 00:34:05,880
summarize it's important to start now

00:34:00,170 --> 00:34:07,740
know the tracks and the types of content

00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:10,980
that the track chairs are looking for

00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:13,050
you want to reach out right away to the

00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:15,480
track cheers and ask for their input on

00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:17,220
your ideas and be sure to reach out to

00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:19,680
other experts there are always happy you

00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:21,570
know the open source ethos people are

00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:24,840
happy to contribute and help you create

00:34:21,570 --> 00:34:26,460
the best product possible when you write

00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:28,890
your abstract make sure it's detailed

00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:31,980
with a good story what's the problem

00:34:28,890 --> 00:34:33,840
what's the solution who is this for and

00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:35,910
make sure you highlight where you have

00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:40,200
spoken before so they know that you have

00:34:35,910 --> 00:34:43,020
experience speaking make sure you submit

00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:44,910
before the deadline so that way you can

00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:47,190
read people's comments you could even

00:34:44,910 --> 00:34:49,110
tweet to make sure that people see it's

00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:51,270
there and ask for people to comment and

00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:54,540
then you can use that feedback again to

00:34:51,270 --> 00:34:56,940
tweak your abstract up until the last

00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:59,120
minute again make sure you submit on

00:34:56,940 --> 00:35:04,410
time because we don't accept late

00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:07,410
submissions and again we as the drupal

I'm sure you probably know who your

00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:30,930
account manager is and their email but I

00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:33,930
put it here just in case and hopefully

00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:36,860
that really helps again you have until

00:35:33,930 --> 00:35:41,760
now and februari 29 to submit your

00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:45,600
session submission and that concludes

00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:47,580
how to write a winning abstract are

00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:50,250
there any questions thanks Megan yeah we

00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:52,620
have had a comment and a question come

00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:54,240
in since I last night after you okay the

00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:57,030
first comment was a little bit of a

00:35:54,240 --> 00:36:00,690
reply to the question about involving

00:35:57,030 --> 00:36:03,750
the community and basically he's saying

00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:05,770
in the past we've had community voting

00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:08,200
on sessions but

00:36:05,770 --> 00:36:11,320
it didn't actually end up yielding the

00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:12,550
most helpful results you know that part

00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:15,190
of the reason that we have the track

00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:18,970
chairs not is not just because their

00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:21,670
content experts they also know what to

00:36:18,970 --> 00:36:23,650
look for as far as presenter skills and

00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:25,990
so that is a pretty valuable resource

00:36:23,650 --> 00:36:29,230
that you can't necessarily get through a

00:36:25,990 --> 00:36:33,210
voting system so that was a bit of the

00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:36,370
comment and then we had somebody ask a

00:36:33,210 --> 00:36:38,020
question here saying it seems like in

00:36:36,370 --> 00:36:41,350
the past there's been a preference for

00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:43,180
pretty narrow topics ie issues with

00:36:41,350 --> 00:36:46,390
using twig for theming responsive Drupal

00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:48,040
8 sites versus general sites like

00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:51,100
front-end challenges with drupal theming

00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:55,960
is there any truth to that that the

00:36:51,100 --> 00:37:00,430
narrower topic seem to be preferred huh

00:36:55,960 --> 00:37:03,310
that is a good question you know I

00:37:00,430 --> 00:37:06,100
really can't speak to that but Brennan

00:37:03,310 --> 00:37:08,020
if you can pass that person I can't see

00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:10,300
the who's asking questions but if you

00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:12,850
can connect me with them I can

00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:15,280
definitely do some follow-up sure yeah

00:37:12,850 --> 00:37:17,410
I'm happy to connect yeah you were done

00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:19,570
and I'd also say that as you are

00:37:17,410 --> 00:37:21,190
thinking about your session and which

00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:23,230
track you want to speak to you I would

00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:24,400
also suggest you ask that question of

00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:25,570
the tractor are they looking for

00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:28,450
something broader they looking for

00:37:25,570 --> 00:37:31,600
something narrow because they might have

00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:33,700
a personal preference of what gives the

00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:40,240
most education right if you go deep or

00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:42,180
Big O a mile wide great well that is the

00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:45,610
end of the list of questions I have here

00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:47,350
okay great all right well thank you so

00:37:45,610 --> 00:37:48,400
much for your time I hope this helped it

00:37:47,350 --> 00:37:49,930
was the first time we gave this

00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:53,140
presentation so if you have feedback

00:37:49,930 --> 00:37:54,610
just let us know and i will be sending

00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:57,520
