00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:51,480
so I let me just hop over to to my to my

00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:53,670
keynote here so today we're going to

00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:57,050
talk about you know what we've been

00:00:53,670 --> 00:01:01,699
doing in spark in terms of improving

00:00:57,050 --> 00:01:04,439
both Drupal 7 and Drupal 8 for mobile

00:01:01,699 --> 00:01:08,820
starting with you know the content

00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:10,439
author who's the real focus of spark but

00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:15,299
let me tell you a little bit about spark

00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:17,880
first before i go into mobile and you

00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:20,159
know really dig into the details there

00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:23,119
that the spark is spark as a

00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:25,290
distribution but it's not really a

00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:29,369
distribution in this in this sense that

00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:32,220
distributions are usually you know made

00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:34,110
by you know companies who are making

00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:36,329
things in Drupal like drupal commerce or

00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:38,040
you know a lot of these other distros

00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:41,460
that have kind of a specific business

00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:44,369
purpose spark is really something that

00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:48,030
that that that we initiated here at

00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:49,950
aquia that grease really wanted to put

00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:51,390
together to focus on just generally

00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:54,240
improving the content authoring

00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:57,780
experience for for all of Drupal in

00:01:54,240 --> 00:02:02,009
Drupal 7 and because the release cycle

00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:04,500
of Drupal takes quite a lot of time we

00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:07,610
wanted to have a place where we could

00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:09,679
take you know some real you know

00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:11,810
usability improvements

00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:13,579
and code improvements and move them into

00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:16,760
this distribution that would be sort of

00:02:13,579 --> 00:02:19,340
almost like a you know a place where we

00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:22,459
could we could prove out and test you

00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:26,090
know some of the best concepts in

00:02:22,459 --> 00:02:27,650
usability and design and development so

00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:30,200
that we could get them kind of on deck

00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:32,359
for the next the next release of Drupal

00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:34,639
and that's really what what it's all

00:02:32,359 --> 00:02:37,900
about it again focused mainly on the

00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:40,670
authoring experience and just improving

00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:42,319
drupal's overall usability and not

00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:44,959
necessarily focused on any kind of

00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:47,750
specific industry vertical or business

00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:50,150
purpose and one of our hopes is that has

00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:52,099
always been that we could you know that

00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:54,079
other that other people out there would

00:02:52,099 --> 00:02:56,750
take spark and then use it as kind of

00:02:54,079 --> 00:02:58,819
the baseline or kind of foundation for

00:02:56,750 --> 00:03:00,709
their own distributions so that they

00:02:58,819 --> 00:03:05,750
would all kind of inherit those those

00:03:00,709 --> 00:03:07,159
great usability features so why content

00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:10,549
authoring and how does that relate to

00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:13,849
mobile content authoring has been our

00:03:10,549 --> 00:03:16,609
focus because you know as we looked out

00:03:13,849 --> 00:03:20,479
across the landscape of all the other

00:03:16,609 --> 00:03:21,889
competitive CMS's you know back about a

00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:24,680
year ago when we first started working

00:03:21,889 --> 00:03:27,459
on spark and some some people who have

00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:30,019
seen some of Greece's presentations or

00:03:27,459 --> 00:03:32,900
my previous webinars will have maybe

00:03:30,019 --> 00:03:37,069
seen some of this before but we looked

00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:41,840
at a wordpress cq5 10 years can get it

00:03:37,069 --> 00:03:46,629
I'm not sharing my screen on tools not a

00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:46,629
good thing hold on one second

00:03:55,810 --> 00:04:01,220
alright so you didn't really miss

00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:10,130
anything in my slides there it was

00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:12,590
really pretty much just go back here

00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:14,240
yeah what is spark and why content

00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:19,610
authoring content authoring and how does

00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:23,200
that relate to mobile and again so we

00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:25,100
started looking at our competitive

00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:29,570
content management systems both

00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:32,090
proprietary and an open source and you

00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:34,070
know put together these spider graphs

00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:35,930
which kind of illustrate you know where

00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:38,870
we were falling behind or whether

00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:41,390
deficiencies of Drupal were and where

00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:43,010
the strengths of Drupal were so so in

00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:45,410
the technical area Drupal was very

00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:48,410
strong against a lot of the others CMS's

00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:52,940
but in the in the area of authoring

00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:55,010
experience a lot of the lot of the other

00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:57,260
systems were really really kind of

00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:59,660
killing us wordpress always has you know

00:04:57,260 --> 00:05:02,030
been well known for a good content

00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:05,960
authoring experience squiz and flown

00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:07,700
some smaller you know CMS's have made

00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:11,919
some real advances in that area in terms

00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:14,540
of in place editing NC q5 is a big

00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:17,960
proprietary competitor that also has

00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:19,250
some really good authoring experience so

00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,690
then we looked at these various

00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:22,550
different areas obviously what we're

00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:25,040
talking about today is mobile authoring

00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:27,530
and you can see here that you know we're

00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:29,150
well we were well behind in that area

00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:30,950
when we first started looking at spark

00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:33,260
what we're going to show you today is

00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:37,010
that we've really kind of you know come

00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:39,560
a long way since then so our goal from

00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:41,570
the get-go was to you know build as

00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:44,180
angie says a kick-ass authoring

00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:46,070
experience for drupal 7 so that people

00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:48,560
can use it now and then as i was

00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:51,470
mentioning earlier and then sort of have

00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:53,060
those improvements on deck to be poured

00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:55,100
it into Drupal core and we've actually

00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:55,880
done that we thought we would put a lot

00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:57,980
of them into

00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:59,240
Corbin and Jesse's going to demo you

00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:02,500
know a lot of those things that we've

00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:05,870
been working on in just a minute okay so

00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:07,520
so the audience for spark who will use

00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:09,470
spark I kind of touched on that a little

00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,300
bit already in terms of you know we

00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:13,580
really it's everybody it's not any

00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:16,370
specific industry vertical it's it's all

00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:17,870
users of Drupal but particularly the

00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:20,870
users of Drupal who are who are doing

00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:22,790
the managing of the content on a

00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:24,440
day-to-day basis this is a content

00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:26,270
management system so you know the

00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:28,190
content author is really the people the

00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:30,200
person who we should be giving sort of

00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:35,300
that you know the king's chair to here

00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:38,230
and and and and in terms of who's

00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:42,290
working on spark this is the team

00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:43,720
obviously grease is you know intimately

00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:49,030
involved in everything that we're doing

00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:52,280
angie is managing the day-to-day project

00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:56,230
that's neither third one there Kevin I

00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:59,030
am I'm leading up the UX and in

00:06:56,230 --> 00:07:01,930
designing you know a lot of new types of

00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:05,480
patterns Preston has been prototyping

00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:11,090
for us doing HTML and JavaScript

00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:14,270
prototypes when Lear's in Belgium is one

00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:16,910
of the one of the key developers behind

00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:20,570
to edit in-place gabor who you probably

00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:22,880
are very familiar with is also

00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:24,260
developing a lot of the nitty-gritty

00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:27,620
backend stuff and jesse is working

00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:30,650
primarily on front-end development but

00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:33,340
also on you know a lot of the really the

00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:38,030
application development now and our mesh

00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:39,710
is is testing everything that we do and

00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:41,150
our mesh has actually been testing a lot

00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:44,210
of other things in Drupal as well not

00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:46,520
just not just stuff that spark has has

00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:48,020
been working on but but but just durable

00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:50,540
in general going back as far as the

00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:52,600
Minnesota usability study he's been

00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:56,140
really intimately involved with Drupal

00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:58,370
so what's on a road map we've got

00:07:56,140 --> 00:08:02,090
content creation and editing

00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:03,139
is very important obviously primary to

00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:05,030
what we're talking about and then

00:08:03,139 --> 00:08:07,130
dashboards and workflow which we've

00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:08,240
spent a little bit of time on mobile

00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:11,630
which we're going to be talking about

00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,800
today but then also I'm you know going

00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:15,979
forward we're going to be getting into

00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:17,389
much more heavily into media as well as

00:08:15,979 --> 00:08:19,520
content staging and localization

00:08:17,389 --> 00:08:21,560
actually we're just starting to kick off

00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,940
a real big localization project taking

00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:25,280
the work that de Bourgh's done and

00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:29,690
bringing that forward with better

00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:32,690
usability so we content creation and

00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:35,570
editing a lot has been done in d eight

00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:37,700
core and also in spark in the Drupal 7

00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:40,010
version of spark so as we do these

00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:43,159
things as we make improvements like edit

00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:45,339
module we are back porting all of those

00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:48,470
things actually also Theodore by della

00:08:45,339 --> 00:08:50,170
not as another contributor who's been

00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:52,880
working on the on the team

00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:54,800
intermittently and he's been he's done a

00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:57,589
lot of work and back porting those

00:08:54,800 --> 00:09:01,910
things into d7 so you have edit module

00:08:57,589 --> 00:09:03,440
you have toolbar in d7 now I think it's

00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:05,660
worth noting that we actually devote

00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:08,570
twenty percent of our time every week

00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:11,089
back pointing doesn't right yeah we have

00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:14,330
we have a full day that's correct jesse

00:09:11,089 --> 00:09:17,750
is you know pointing out that we have it

00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:20,600
we actually have a d7 day that's that's

00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:23,750
entirely devoted to to just working on

00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:25,910
d7 and we're not entirely focused on d 8

00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:28,370
although you know the DA's stuff is

00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:30,350
obviously because we're you know right

00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:33,830
in the middle of the cycle very very

00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:35,209
very key but so mobile authoring a lot

00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:37,810
of the improvements that we've done in

00:09:35,209 --> 00:09:41,000
da core in terms of mobile authoring and

00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:44,300
we and others also have been have been

00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:46,010
ported back into d7 media management

00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:48,650
we're still working on designs for that

00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:51,560
on improving media module content

00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:52,640
staging where we haven't started on that

00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:55,279
but we know it's very key and

00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:59,360
localization again like I said we are

00:09:55,279 --> 00:10:02,390
we're working on that so with that I'd

00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:05,150
like to pass things over to to Jesse and

00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:07,730
she's going to show you a lot of you

00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:12,440
know what we've done in both d7

00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:14,269
d 8 and you know kind of demo you know

00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:16,040
how that's all working and a lot of it

00:10:14,269 --> 00:10:18,290
is working incredibly smoothly and

00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:19,670
beautifully kudos to her and to all of

00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:24,589
the rest of the team for making all this

00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:25,850
work I just paint pictures I'm trying to

00:10:24,589 --> 00:10:28,970
figure out how to get this thing to

00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:35,620
share my screen I do I need to pass it

00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:35,620
to you or it's Airy then man let's go

00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:53,930
okay i'm getting share my desktop

00:10:40,209 --> 00:10:59,230
application great looks like it's

00:10:53,930 --> 00:11:01,610
anchored alright so I'm Jessie beach i'm

00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:03,440
primarily a front-end developer and I've

00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:05,930
been on this party now for probably

00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:09,500
eight months since just before drupalcon

00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:10,790
Munich I joined the team and I've only

00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:12,980
been in Drupal for about three and a

00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:15,019
half years now about the same amount of

00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:18,709
time I've been back via so I've kind of

00:11:15,019 --> 00:11:22,160
grown up with Drupal 8 and the mature

00:11:18,709 --> 00:11:24,889
Drupal 7 so what I want to show here

00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:27,620
today is not necessarily or is

00:11:24,889 --> 00:11:31,130
definitely not the work of just a spark

00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:33,220
team add there are tens if not hundreds

00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:36,290
of developers that have been working on

00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:39,110
various aspects of the mobilization of

00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:41,300
Drupal 8 and you know we've had a small

00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:42,949
corner of that and I think our team has

00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:46,430
been involved in a lot of that work but

00:11:42,949 --> 00:11:51,529
by no means you know I have we have we

00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:54,860
done possibly even ten percent of it so

00:11:51,529 --> 00:11:58,880
what we're looking at now is stock d8

00:11:54,860 --> 00:12:00,649
head as of this morning and i just want

00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:02,449
to mention that this might get a little

00:12:00,649 --> 00:12:06,620
technical i'm going to show some code

00:12:02,449 --> 00:12:08,269
and there might also be bugs so a lot of

00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:11,120
the things that we're doing our very

00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:12,980
much in active development as you know

00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:15,890
there are inconsistencies we're working

00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:17,720
to iron those out and what we're looking

00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:19,610
at today is essentially the state of the

00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:20,649
art in terms of Drupal 8 and its mobile

00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:22,629
support

00:12:20,649 --> 00:12:25,930
and there are a couple of patches that

00:12:22,629 --> 00:12:28,480
I've applied to this demo that are under

00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:30,879
review or RT PC but not quite committed

00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,139
yet a few of them I'm hoping will be

00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:34,899
committed by the end of the day so we'll

00:12:32,139 --> 00:12:37,420
say so we're looking at add the Drupal 8

00:12:34,899 --> 00:12:40,899
demo and the first thing I want to point

00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:43,660
out is that the Bartik theme itself from

00:12:40,899 --> 00:12:45,670
Drupal 7 has been I guess responsive

00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:48,790
eyes would be the best word for it so if

00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:51,550
we take what is a desktop side site here

00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:54,449
and scrunch it down we're going to start

00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:57,209
to notice that things change in the

00:12:54,449 --> 00:13:00,579
theme will notice that the primary tabs

00:12:57,209 --> 00:13:05,529
go to buttons and then as we get smaller

00:13:00,579 --> 00:13:07,509
and smaller we notice that the main

00:13:05,529 --> 00:13:11,110
content and the sidebar is adjusting to

00:13:07,509 --> 00:13:14,199
a single column display you'll also

00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:18,100
notice up at the top this new toolbar so

00:13:14,199 --> 00:13:21,309
we have the primary tabs up top and then

00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:24,100
secondary tabs down below and this is

00:13:21,309 --> 00:13:27,100
made to fit within a desktop or as we

00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:32,249
scrunch this down into a smaller screen

00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:32,249
and everything adjusts as we get smaller

00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:40,360
and I just want to compare this to the

00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:44,740
Drupal 7 version to really give that

00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:47,129
sense of you know how different this is

00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:51,399
so this is a Drupal 7 site this is just

00:13:47,129 --> 00:13:54,899
d7 head and as we scrunch this down

00:13:51,399 --> 00:14:00,329
you'll notice that the toolbar kind of

00:13:54,899 --> 00:14:00,329
breaks and wraps in a really ugly way

00:14:07,329 --> 00:14:12,649
and one of the other pieces that we have

00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:17,779
running underneath here you'll notice in

00:14:12,649 --> 00:14:19,760
the d7 site that when we scrunch it the

00:14:17,779 --> 00:14:22,519
text the title of the screen here is

00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:25,070
being overlapped by the toolbar we have

00:14:22,519 --> 00:14:28,130
a new tool in Drupal 8 call them the

00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:36,019
displaced function and I can pull it up

00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:38,029
really quickly and the display function

00:14:36,019 --> 00:14:40,459
is a new tool for front-end developers

00:14:38,029 --> 00:14:44,240
that allows you to push your content

00:14:40,459 --> 00:14:46,220
around the screen and out of the way of

00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,779
elements that are pegged to the edge of

00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:56,720
the viewport like the sidebar and the

00:14:47,779 --> 00:14:58,550
tool are up here so the other theme

00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:01,459
that's been ported over to responsive

00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:07,730
view is the 7 theme and let's jump over

00:15:01,459 --> 00:15:13,760
into an admin fee right now so this is

00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:18,829
the standard 7 admin theme and I think

00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:21,560
probably the most impressive example of

00:15:18,829 --> 00:15:25,760
a responsive development in Drupal 8 is

00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:27,110
the views you I just had I don't think

00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:29,420
anyone on the spark team touched this

00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:32,870
other than when I wrote the CSS for a

00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:36,709
view 3 like two years ago but since then

00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:39,199
we've had this very complex you I turn

00:15:36,709 --> 00:15:43,060
into a UI that you could work on your

00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:45,560
phone whoo innocentive isn't it yeah

00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:46,880
it's just amazed factually the first

00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:48,529
time I've seen that I haven't really

00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:50,390
been in views for a while that is pretty

00:15:48,529 --> 00:15:51,500
that's pretty impressed yet in fact I

00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:53,300
mentioned this yesterday and you were

00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:55,820
incredulous that it i didn't i didn't

00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:59,480
believe it was true but you know it is

00:15:55,820 --> 00:16:01,970
working beautifully yeah awesome so I

00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:05,089
was when that worked I was also quite

00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:06,470
thrilled that's one of the most complex

00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:07,519
you guys I think we have in Drupal and

00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:08,959
the fact that you can do it on your

00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:12,140
phone it's really impressive that's

00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:15,860
really great and we can look at a couple

00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:17,170
more of them so we have here the new

00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:19,930
modules page

00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:24,100
called extend and you'll notice there's

00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:26,320
been a lot of work done to take what is

00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:28,450
or has been a very overwhelming page if

00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:35,230
we were to go back to the Drupal 7 view

00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:38,529
of this just to get a good a fairly

00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:40,480
overwhelming and rich page and back in

00:16:38,529 --> 00:16:44,769
the Drupal a few we now have information

00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:48,029
well hidden and will notice that when we

00:16:44,769 --> 00:16:52,990
take this screen down to a smaller size

00:16:48,029 --> 00:16:57,070
the information starts to hide itself so

00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:59,709
that we can you know see these fields on

00:16:57,070 --> 00:17:01,510
a smaller screen and you'll notice this

00:16:59,709 --> 00:17:04,480
link right here underneath the core

00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:06,699
header when I'm at a larger size that

00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:11,439
link isn't there when I pull this back

00:17:06,699 --> 00:17:14,079
down that link becomes available and

00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:17,260
when they click on it it takes what was

00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:19,660
a complex table and ensures through that

00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:22,630
full complexity again so I can click in

00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:25,959
and the idea here is that on a smaller

00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:29,049
screen we can hide some information but

00:17:25,959 --> 00:17:30,850
not make it unavailable and provide

00:17:29,049 --> 00:17:35,710
these are a way to to pull it back into

00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:38,679
view and this is one of the first major

00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:42,460
patches I got to to Drupal 8 back in

00:17:38,679 --> 00:17:46,000
Munich and if we look at the way that

00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:48,130
this is implemented essentially we're

00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:52,750
setting some classes on the table

00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:54,340
headers so we have this some slack

00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:55,929
variable right here the responsive

00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:59,169
priority medium and responsive party low

00:17:55,929 --> 00:18:01,990
and these essentially mapped to media

00:17:59,169 --> 00:18:04,870
queries in the theme itself that high

00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:07,059
b's table rows when there is enough room

00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:08,770
of the screen and this is done in a

00:18:07,059 --> 00:18:10,990
backwards compatible way if you don't

00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:13,600
include these classes then the full

00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:15,580
table in your module will be all the

00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:17,740
columns will be visible only by adding

00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:20,740
them do you hide the columns in smaller

00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:23,410
screen and there is just a little bit of

00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:25,270
JavaScript this little table responsive

00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:27,580
script that has to be included in your

00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:31,000
module and with those classes in the

00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:34,730
script you have fully responsive tables

00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:36,380
that is also very awesome and we've got

00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:37,460
that in the content screen as well I

00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:40,010
think this one's a little bit more

00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:42,290
impressive because we go from a table

00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:45,590
with a lot of columns and this is the

00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:48,650
one that I think you drove us to develop

00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:50,870
this behavior because it was just

00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:53,810
impossible to view the screen on a small

00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:56,060
device but as we bring this down will

00:18:53,810 --> 00:18:59,950
notice that we go from all of the

00:18:56,060 --> 00:19:04,850
columns to the medium priority columns

00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:07,490
to just the essential elements right and

00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:12,880
this you know works well on a small

00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:12,880
device I see if i can actually terrific

00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:31,420
so xcode come on little paste button yep

00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:33,710
so there is the screen on a small device

00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:38,950
ignore this little white gap on the side

00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:38,950
that's just a little bug in the themes

00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:49,910
pay no attention to the man behind the

00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:52,340
curtain all right so another piece on

00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:54,500
the mobile front we've got our list of

00:19:52,340 --> 00:20:01,250
content here if we go to the add content

00:19:54,500 --> 00:20:03,830
button so I think this is one of these

00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:06,200
forms that it's probably used the most

00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:09,350
wonderful when it comes to content

00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:12,380
authors and people's daily interactions

00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:17,050
with Drupal and most this work was done

00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:20,750
I think who's it I'm Boyan Gilroy and

00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:22,820
did you say Ryan was for canvas yeah I

00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:24,800
believe Ryan did some some design work

00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:27,830
originally on this but i think it

00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:29,930
probably was mostly yo Roy who dad's

00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:32,780
design or commando yawn did a lot of

00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:34,880
usability research and into you know

00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:37,880
what the best practices were for this

00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:39,620
you know for separating out let you know

00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:42,080
less important options but nevertheless

00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:43,670
need to be there on the screen and then

00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:45,380
swim tell i think was the first

00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:48,890
did the primary development for this

00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:51,230
page right so again we have a fairly

00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:53,410
complex screen that can get more complex

00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:55,640
as modules add in their separate pieces

00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:58,550
over on the side we have what used to be

00:20:55,640 --> 00:21:02,680
the vertical tab displayed now in a

00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:05,900
details and summaries so this is one of

00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:07,430
my favorite additions and then we see

00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:09,890
the responsiveness kicking in as the

00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:11,270
screen gets smaller we now using the

00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:14,300
details element which is newly

00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:17,120
introduced HT html5 elements introduced

00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:18,920
I think for sort of general use in

00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:22,460
browsers only within the past couple of

00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:25,700
months and that's come along and there's

00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:27,350
I believe somewhere down deep a polyfill

00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:29,270
that gets these details to work on

00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:33,110
browsers that don't support them

00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:36,260
natively but again we have a nicely

00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:40,370
responsive UI that works well on the

00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:42,290
phone this is one of my favorite screens

00:21:40,370 --> 00:21:45,740
I think the people have worked on this

00:21:42,290 --> 00:21:49,610
did a really bang-up job on it it's

00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:52,670
working really nicely yeah so most of

00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:55,270
those things were not the primary focus

00:21:52,670 --> 00:21:58,130
of the spark team those are just sort of

00:21:55,270 --> 00:22:01,190
very general and very important updates

00:21:58,130 --> 00:22:03,470
to Drupal 8 that get key pieces working

00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:05,570
on mobile phones or small devices I

00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:08,090
should say so let's have a look at some

00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:10,220
of the more focused efforts of the spark

00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:12,710
team specifically I want to talk about

00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:19,100
in place editing so let's go back to a

00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:22,250
front page so the authoring experience

00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:24,830
was the improving authoring experience

00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:26,870
as the primary goal of our team's work

00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:29,090
and one of the aspects of that was to

00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:31,190
introduce this idea of in place editing

00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:33,740
and what we want to do with in place

00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:37,070
editing is allow someone to come in and

00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:38,570
make a quick edit to content on the

00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:44,570
screen without having to go into the

00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:48,890
full edit overlay or form so we've now

00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:51,080
introduced these little contextual links

00:22:48,890 --> 00:22:52,760
they were they exist before in Drupal 7

00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:54,380
this is just the contextual links module

00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:56,679
but we've put in an extra option for

00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:58,840
quick edit which contrasts with

00:22:56,679 --> 00:23:02,230
full edit right here so when we quick

00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:05,169
edit the editable fields in an object

00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:10,179
become highlighted and when we click

00:23:05,169 --> 00:23:13,179
into them we get the text formatter that

00:23:10,179 --> 00:23:15,789
is associated with your user permissions

00:23:13,179 --> 00:23:22,869
to edit this piece of content and we can

00:23:15,789 --> 00:23:25,929
go in and add something here you should

00:23:22,869 --> 00:23:28,809
have been a also in a in a in a in a in

00:23:25,929 --> 00:23:30,340
a full node because your inner entities

00:23:28,809 --> 00:23:32,350
or most confused I'm all kind of

00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:34,320
presenting in the in the smaller window

00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:36,940
it's it there's two different kinds of

00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:40,720
yeah so we just edited that bit me

00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:49,090
cancel out of that and we'll go into the

00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:50,259
full moon do the full edit there and I

00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:52,720
think what Kevin wanted to show is that

00:23:50,259 --> 00:23:54,429
add the editor itself goes to the full

00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:56,460
width of the screen yeah exactly that's

00:23:54,429 --> 00:24:01,149
what it best when I was getting it yeah

00:23:56,460 --> 00:24:02,559
it was so that's for content one of the

00:24:01,149 --> 00:24:05,559
things we're working on at the moment is

00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:08,950
the ability to quick edit any field and

00:24:05,559 --> 00:24:11,529
Drupal the patches for this are still

00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:14,379
under development but I've got one

00:24:11,529 --> 00:24:19,179
running live here so we can click Edit a

00:24:14,379 --> 00:24:29,590
custom block and this is the body block

00:24:19,179 --> 00:24:31,960
content for that custom blog change and

00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:35,350
if we refresh the screen we see that

00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:38,019
that change is still in place so we're

00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:40,679
working on making essentially anything

00:24:38,019 --> 00:24:42,639
that is a fields in place editable

00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:45,549
including things that have never been

00:24:42,639 --> 00:24:48,789
fields there's work underway to make the

00:24:45,549 --> 00:24:52,110
no title the nude author the publish

00:24:48,789 --> 00:24:54,429
date all those little pieces that are

00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:57,309
essentially part of the template and

00:24:54,429 --> 00:24:59,950
produced outside of the field system

00:24:57,309 --> 00:25:01,509
into fields it's a touch more

00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:04,269
complicated than I think I understand

00:25:01,509 --> 00:25:08,220
but when the day comes that they're made

00:25:04,269 --> 00:25:10,990
editable you know I'll make them pretty

00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:12,880
Jesse can you show how the editing the

00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:16,540
full note goes looks when you go down to

00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:22,180
you know three of three 20 width data

00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:24,940
Finland so we can bring that down quick

00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:29,260
edit it and we see that it's working and

00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:45,100
in fact if I pull that up over here on

00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:49,900
the phone let me go to the same there we

00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:52,750
go will Tim working side by side on the

00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:58,480
phone neck and also obviously with them

00:25:52,750 --> 00:26:01,260
you know with the with the ckeditor you

00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:03,310
know installed and giving us a nice

00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:04,600
options there as well yeah I can't

00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:07,480
believe I didn't even mention that so

00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:12,220
what we're seeing is the ckeditor above

00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:15,730
here and in Drupal 7 we never had a

00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:17,470
default WYSIWYG editor in core motive

00:26:15,730 --> 00:26:20,230
done in Drupal 8 is introduced ckeditor

00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:23,230
as the default editor you no longer need

00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:25,120
to go and install a WYSIWYG editor in

00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:27,310
addition to you know standard Drupal

00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:29,800
installations there for you this is all

00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:31,210
baked in the first thing you do when you

00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:33,280
create a new site is create a node and

00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:36,820
everything is set up to do quick editing

00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:39,630
and ludovic editing that's great and

00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:41,710
that when that ck editor toolbar also

00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:44,160
because of the way it's separated out

00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:47,260
into different little groups which are

00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:48,550
in line blocks you know breaks nicely

00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:50,380
when it when it when it goes down to

00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:52,960
smaller sizes as well and doesn't sort

00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:55,450
of you know act in an awkward way as I

00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:58,480
believe if i recall correctly the time

00:26:55,450 --> 00:27:00,130
tiny MCE does when you when you get it

00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:04,240
to smaller size it's kind of awkward

00:27:00,130 --> 00:27:07,480
yeah my p.m. not chocolate familiar all

00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:09,310
right so we talked about that and

00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:12,700
there's one last feature that I wanted

00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:15,270
to to show in this one I have to move it

00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:15,270
up really quickly

00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:30,610
are you going to do the response yeah

00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:32,620
definitely responsive preview so I'm

00:27:30,610 --> 00:27:35,260
going to show this in Drupal 8 the

00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:37,120
responsive preview module is available

00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:39,429
for anyone to download at the moment and

00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:42,669
it's it's fairly well baked at this

00:27:39,429 --> 00:27:46,480
point so that's that responsive preview

00:27:42,669 --> 00:27:48,370
at drupal.org / project there's a beta

00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:51,700
release for the seven FedEx version and

00:27:48,370 --> 00:27:56,020
the a tedx version is available through

00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:58,350
git clone and if we go back to that so

00:27:56,020 --> 00:28:02,110
um before you get into the actual

00:27:58,350 --> 00:28:03,429
nitty-gritty of showing it but I'd like

00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:07,510
to just say just a couple of words about

00:28:03,429 --> 00:28:08,980
persona because a lot of people have you

00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:11,679
know talked about the fact that you know

00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:13,570
we're presenting or presenting device

00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:15,640
names and there's been some you know

00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:17,830
discussion about you know the fluid

00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:20,410
fluid responsive design and devices not

00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:23,290
being sort of appropriate when we were

00:28:20,410 --> 00:28:24,970
putting this together the the target

00:28:23,290 --> 00:28:27,760
persona that we were really kind of

00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:29,710
thinking about is somebody who's not

00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:32,049
necessarily a developer or a themer

00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:34,750
somebody who's thinking about you know

00:28:32,049 --> 00:28:37,660
making their site responsive across all

00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:41,080
of these across a you know a fluid range

00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:43,090
of sizes which which we are totally you

00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:45,580
know which is totally the ideal in terms

00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:47,470
of design but the persona is more the

00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:50,770
marketing person or that or the site

00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:54,040
owner who or the business person who has

00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:56,200
a specific need to see a site displayed

00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:58,299
in a certain device because they have

00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:59,950
knowledge about who their audiences and

00:28:58,299 --> 00:29:02,799
what type of devices that their audience

00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:06,669
might be using so I know for instance if

00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:09,850
I'm you know hasbro you know that most

00:29:06,669 --> 00:29:11,770
of my audience is you know on nooks and

00:29:09,850 --> 00:29:14,640
kindles or something like that you know

00:29:11,770 --> 00:29:16,870
whereas if I'm you know if I'm

00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:19,660
NBCUniversal it's a very different kind

00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:21,040
of a you know an audience so so these so

00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:22,299
people who are looking at their sites

00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:25,780
and putting them together and building

00:29:22,299 --> 00:29:27,159
them they that's not the that that's not

00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:28,840
the same as the person who's theming

00:29:27,159 --> 00:29:32,080
aside who really wants a kind of

00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:35,620
a fluid representation of pixel pixel

00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:38,440
sizes are you know viewport sizes this

00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:40,120
is for users who want to just see I want

00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:42,460
I want to see how my site looks in this

00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:46,690
specific device so i can make my content

00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:50,039
look right in that and to that end we've

00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:53,679
introduced this little menu up here

00:29:50,039 --> 00:29:55,690
which has just a couple devices by

00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:57,669
default there's a discussion going on

00:29:55,690 --> 00:30:00,340
now about how we can expose this list to

00:29:57,669 --> 00:30:07,210
make it configurable but let's have a

00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:09,850
look mmm so we're looking at what this

00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:11,500
page would look like in a device that

00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:15,429
has about the same dimensions and

00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:18,190
resolution as an iphone 5 let's have a

00:30:15,429 --> 00:30:20,590
look at the four we see the height

00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:27,130
reduced a little bit and we can also

00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:31,750
look at ipad size rotate that and all

00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:34,120
the way up to typical desktop size for

00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:36,309
them and just to give you a sense of

00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:39,010
what this looks like on a site that

00:30:36,309 --> 00:30:40,330
doesn't have a responsive team we have

00:30:39,010 --> 00:30:48,760
back part of this module as i mentioned

00:30:40,330 --> 00:30:52,510
to drupal 7 that looks so cool we don't

00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:54,970
have the toolbar injection points to put

00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:56,440
a nice little drop-down up here so we

00:30:54,970 --> 00:30:59,289
just have a block over here and we can

00:30:56,440 --> 00:31:04,120
have a look at what this site looks like

00:30:59,289 --> 00:31:07,779
on an iphone 5 wim layers did the lion

00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:09,880
share of the development for i guess

00:31:07,779 --> 00:31:13,570
getting the aspect ratio correct on this

00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:15,100
so that we can accurately represent what

00:31:13,570 --> 00:31:20,970
this page would look like on this device

00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:20,970
by a 2d scaling it down from full-size

00:31:21,809 --> 00:31:28,990
look that's cool i did not know that

00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:31,450
yeah so it's not a perfect preview I

00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:34,539
mean there is no there's no substitute

00:31:31,450 --> 00:31:35,890
for looking on something on a device you

00:31:34,539 --> 00:31:38,950
know we're not emulating the device

00:31:35,890 --> 00:31:40,270
we're not trying to tell you exactly

00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:41,490
what it would look like but as you

00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:44,130
mentioned for someone who wants

00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:46,920
get a quick sense of what does this page

00:31:44,130 --> 00:31:48,900
look like on a smaller device am i

00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:50,429
creating a layout in my my no that's

00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:52,050
going to look bad where does the

00:31:50,429 --> 00:31:54,330
headline break this is what the marketer

00:31:52,050 --> 00:31:56,100
wants to know what what at what word in

00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:57,780
the headline is at breaking breaking

00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:59,220
down when it's when it when it's showing

00:31:57,780 --> 00:32:02,150
on a phone and where is it breaking

00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:04,559
words when it's showing on an iPod yeah

00:32:02,150 --> 00:32:07,890
so that's one of the features that will

00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:10,320
exist as a contributed module you know

00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:12,179
it's in the queue as a proposed feature

00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:14,690
to Drupal 8 but the the bar to

00:32:12,179 --> 00:32:17,190
introducing features now is very high so

00:32:14,690 --> 00:32:18,960
time will tell you know what its fate is

00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:26,520
but it's available and will be available

00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:29,809
for inclusion in people's projects great

00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:31,770
and in the one minute I have left to

00:32:29,809 --> 00:32:36,020
chat about these things I wanted to

00:32:31,770 --> 00:32:38,429
mention that we're moving ahead with

00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:40,800
conversion of many of the JavaScript

00:32:38,429 --> 00:32:43,320
files in Drupal 8 to the backbone

00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:47,850
framework which is I'm nicely

00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:50,040
encapsulated and robust model view

00:32:47,850 --> 00:32:52,530
controller framework for JavaScript and

00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:54,630
a lot of these features are already

00:32:52,530 --> 00:32:56,460
running off of backbone and more and

00:32:54,630 --> 00:32:59,429
more where we're getting to the point

00:32:56,460 --> 00:33:01,500
where we're converting previous scripts

00:32:59,429 --> 00:33:04,280
over to it and this is one of those

00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:06,390
things that I feel like is going to be

00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:08,880
extremely exciting to people are doing

00:33:06,390 --> 00:33:10,950
from the development on Drupal over the

00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:12,270
next three and four years as we move

00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:16,200
more and more to single page

00:33:12,270 --> 00:33:19,830
applications so driving this underneath

00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:21,750
when I click on the iphone 4 they're the

00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:25,050
same backbone model that's building this

00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:30,270
preview right here it's also driving the

00:33:25,050 --> 00:33:32,429
view here that does the drop-down to get

00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:35,040
60 seconds of kickers nice that's that

00:33:32,429 --> 00:33:37,679
super cool I think backbone is awesome I

00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:41,330
mean I you know Jesse will tell you I'm

00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:46,170
a very much of a novice at javascript

00:33:41,330 --> 00:33:48,510
but but but I can see that the power of

00:33:46,170 --> 00:33:49,530
it and the value of it it's just it's

00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:51,690
just

00:33:49,530 --> 00:33:56,730
going to you know provide some awesome

00:33:51,690 --> 00:34:00,660
stuff for us so I envy people who can

00:33:56,730 --> 00:34:02,310
understand it great so that's pretty

00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:04,650
much everything I wanted to show really

00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:06,210
quickly that was all awesome I mean yeah

00:34:04,650 --> 00:34:08,190
yeah like I said before some of that I

00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:10,140
have not even seen yet I've been so

00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:12,659
heads down in sort of new designs but

00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:16,860
you know that is all really working so

00:34:12,659 --> 00:34:18,150
beautifully and you know it's just you

00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:20,460
know when we think back to you know what

00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:24,419
d7 or even d6 look like it's just like

00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:26,760
it's we're not all here yeah this this

00:34:24,419 --> 00:34:30,030
represents a lot of work at least two

00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:32,790
years of solid work by John Alvin's

00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:36,450
mobile initiative and everyone that's

00:34:32,790 --> 00:34:39,810
been contributing to that you know the

00:34:36,450 --> 00:34:42,150
few COI team I it's hard to express how

00:34:39,810 --> 00:34:45,450
many aspects have dribble we had to

00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:47,940
touch and an update to get it to all

00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:49,919
work so seamlessly and you know it

00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:52,860
there's still more work to go in the

00:34:49,919 --> 00:34:55,260
middle of the cleanup period where we're

00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:56,669
getting these disparate functions or

00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:59,250
features that we've introduced to all

00:34:56,669 --> 00:35:01,200
play nicely together and we're always

00:34:59,250 --> 00:35:03,600
running into cases where they they don't

00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:07,380
quite work well but I feel like we've

00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:09,450
hit you know a good pace of of active

00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:13,500
development where things are starting to

00:35:09,450 --> 00:35:16,410
really click into place yeah yeah and

00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:18,270
all you know from from my perspective

00:35:16,410 --> 00:35:21,110
just looking at it just watching it come

00:35:18,270 --> 00:35:24,170
together it's really it's really

00:35:21,110 --> 00:35:26,520
beginning to gel you know in a big way

00:35:24,170 --> 00:35:31,050
yeah I think we could we could start to

00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:32,880
take some of those questions right thank

00:35:31,050 --> 00:35:35,970
you thank you so much that overview

00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:40,980
Jesse I was totally amazed to see some

00:35:35,970 --> 00:35:42,930
of that how simple that is to make some

00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:44,580
of its of work i also just wanted to

00:35:42,930 --> 00:35:49,650
give you kudos on some of your lorem

00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:51,660
ipsum text over on the left I don't know

00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:53,990
how you'd enter 5 tumblr but I'm very

00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:57,450
interested in seeing what that means

00:35:53,990 --> 00:36:02,970
that is a hipster ipsum if anyone is

00:35:57,450 --> 00:36:04,980
interested Oh mr. Anson that's right you

00:36:02,970 --> 00:36:10,380
I've been going with bacon ipsum for a

00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:12,150
long time is my people very good yeah

00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:13,710
but we do have some questions I want to

00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:17,130
make sure we get too many of those we

00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:21,390
possibly can trying to get it to open it

00:36:17,130 --> 00:36:27,120
was opened before like in one second but

00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:28,530
did not seem to wanna open for me so I

00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:31,200
don't know actually Hannah I don't know

00:36:28,530 --> 00:36:32,760
if you can get a table impacts that

00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:34,650
blocks won't open for me right now and

00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:35,640
if you have access to gratis maybe you

00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:40,140
could start in with some of the

00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:41,610
questions I got it nevermind good

00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:44,190
alright so the first question that came

00:36:41,610 --> 00:36:45,990
in and one of our listeners here wanted

00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:49,140
to hear a little bit more about this

00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:52,530
place work that you were talking about

00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:53,910
can you give a more detailed example or

00:36:52,530 --> 00:36:58,830
point to a reef are where there's more

00:36:53,910 --> 00:37:02,160
detailed example or overview yeah so

00:36:58,830 --> 00:37:05,520
probably the best place to look is the

00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:07,860
source code of d8 but barring that I

00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:10,260
would just say that what dis place is

00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:12,000
doing is looking in the Dom four

00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:15,660
elements that have certain attributes

00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:18,150
and then attribute is a data offset top

00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:20,070
or data offset bottom and it goes

00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:22,770
through the DOM and it collects all of

00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:25,620
these elements that have these

00:37:22,770 --> 00:37:28,490
attributes and attempts to calculate how

00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:30,990
far from the edge of the viewport

00:37:28,490 --> 00:37:34,460
something might want to displays itself

00:37:30,990 --> 00:37:38,010
these are always suggestion so there's a

00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:39,810
event attached to the document and your

00:37:38,010 --> 00:37:42,240
module can listen for that event and

00:37:39,810 --> 00:37:44,960
then when that event fires on screen

00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:47,400
resize you get an object back that has

00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:50,160
displaced values for the four edges of

00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:52,650
the screen and your module can choose to

00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:54,410
use those values to perhaps position

00:37:52,650 --> 00:37:59,310
itself you know to the left to the right

00:37:54,410 --> 00:38:00,750
if I can just share my desktop am I

00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:03,270
still sharing my desktop another guy and

00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:06,290
connect them into the presenter yeah

00:38:03,270 --> 00:38:06,290
you'll have to pull that back up

00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:15,760
right here we go okay so what's

00:38:13,930 --> 00:38:18,339
happening here if I open up the

00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:21,430
structure the overlay module is

00:38:18,339 --> 00:38:23,920
implementing Drupal displays in order to

00:38:21,430 --> 00:38:25,780
know how far from the edge of the screen

00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:27,010
and should position itself so this is

00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:30,310
probably the best place to go look for

00:38:27,010 --> 00:38:31,960
an example the overlay module and as I

00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:39,910
adjust the screen the overlay module

00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:42,040
adjust himself great another quick

00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:45,839
question here where is the people

00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:50,290
responsible located is that in the 17

00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:56,650
the table responsive is in misc so core

00:38:50,290 --> 00:39:00,640
misc kind of like it something around it

00:38:56,650 --> 00:39:03,599
is a dumping ground indeed luckily

00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:09,520
island of misfit island of misfit toys

00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:11,680
yep my favorite is awesome good and can

00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:16,780
you compare this Park and canopy distro

00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:18,849
I think they're complementary um yeah

00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:22,089
yeah I think they don't they don't

00:39:18,849 --> 00:39:24,819
really overlap you could almost really

00:39:22,089 --> 00:39:27,670
install one and then install all of the

00:39:24,819 --> 00:39:30,450
modules from the other and have like a

00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:34,839
really kind of you know seamless

00:39:30,450 --> 00:39:37,270
experience I don't I don't think there

00:39:34,839 --> 00:39:39,339
are any big over big like you know

00:39:37,270 --> 00:39:42,040
conflicts there they've done some great

00:39:39,339 --> 00:39:44,200
awesome work with with layout they're

00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:47,650
mainly concerned with you know bringing

00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:50,530
panels to the sort of next level and you

00:39:47,650 --> 00:39:52,740
know where while we you know you know

00:39:50,530 --> 00:39:55,089
had spent some time working with layouts

00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:57,220
again our main focus has been this

00:39:55,089 --> 00:39:59,250
content authoring experience and you

00:39:57,220 --> 00:40:02,079
know i think that the two are kind of

00:39:59,250 --> 00:40:08,170
really like jesse said complementary to

00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:09,790
one another right um i was really

00:40:08,170 --> 00:40:13,390
excited to see the quick edit function

00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:14,950
that was really really cool and one

00:40:13,390 --> 00:40:19,569
question we had about that was visit by

00:40:14,950 --> 00:40:21,010
class boy does it bypass workflow or can

00:40:19,569 --> 00:40:23,550
you make it work in conjunction with

00:40:21,010 --> 00:40:23,550
workflow

00:40:24,390 --> 00:40:30,880
now it doesn't buy the quick answer to

00:40:28,330 --> 00:40:33,540
that is is no it does not bypass

00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:36,520
workflow quick edit assumes only

00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:38,770
published content so in other words if

00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:42,400
it's on your site you can go to your

00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:44,350
site page and start editing it it's not

00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:46,750
it's not a method for dealing with

00:40:44,350 --> 00:40:49,420
unpublished content or content that's in

00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:51,430
in some kind of a workflow state another

00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:53,140
workflow state one of the things that

00:40:51,430 --> 00:40:54,640
we're going to start thinking about for

00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:57,790
as we start working on stuff that's

00:40:54,640 --> 00:41:00,700
going to be in da contribs dean ein is a

00:40:57,790 --> 00:41:02,560
more robust workflow solution that

00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:05,050
perhaps you know goes in that direction

00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:08,290
we really have to kind of do some more

00:41:05,050 --> 00:41:11,950
research testing and InDesign in order

00:41:08,290 --> 00:41:14,410
to get to that though this the Edit

00:41:11,950 --> 00:41:16,240
in-place is really for the for the user

00:41:14,410 --> 00:41:18,970
who has a piece of published content

00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:21,520
wants to edit that content in place and

00:41:18,970 --> 00:41:26,410
then immediately save it and have it be

00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:27,520
live right away mm-hmm okay as a

00:41:26,410 --> 00:41:29,590
possible you might be able to tunnel

00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:31,540
that with permission alittle bit like is

00:41:29,590 --> 00:41:34,930
that particular part of it not may be

00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:36,280
available to all your users well yeah

00:41:34,930 --> 00:41:38,770
there's a lot of ways that you can

00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:41,680
handle it you know I mean for instance a

00:41:38,770 --> 00:41:43,570
lot of users and certainly a lot of our

00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:46,630
enterprise users would have for instance

00:41:43,570 --> 00:41:48,580
a development environment or a staging

00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:50,700
environment and obviously if you're

00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:52,840
editing something which is quote live

00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:56,320
but it's on your staging environment

00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:58,600
it's not really live because you know

00:41:56,320 --> 00:42:00,400
you need to push those you know push

00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:02,830
that database stuff up to your live

00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:05,080
environment and then and then and then

00:42:02,830 --> 00:42:06,970
get that content live and people use

00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:09,310
various different ways you know methods

00:42:06,970 --> 00:42:10,930
of doing that deploy module or workbench

00:42:09,310 --> 00:42:13,570
or there's lots of different lots of

00:42:10,930 --> 00:42:15,340
different ways in d7 you know and there

00:42:13,570 --> 00:42:19,120
will be a lot of ways i think in d8 for

00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:20,740
people to do that so you know they're

00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:23,980
there certainly workarounds but our

00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:25,690
primary focus was to was that allow

00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:27,490
people who have live content that they

00:42:25,690 --> 00:42:31,260
want to edit to edit that content you

00:42:27,490 --> 00:42:33,850
know right in place on their site right

00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:37,380
and how much this park is in the latest

00:42:33,850 --> 00:42:37,380
version of the eight core

00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:46,290
otisburg um i would say that anything

00:42:44,310 --> 00:42:53,850
we're doing with in place editing with

00:42:46,290 --> 00:42:57,210
the toolbar module with again those

00:42:53,850 --> 00:42:59,550
those to me would be the ones that were

00:42:57,210 --> 00:43:01,080
the most up-to-date on the the

00:42:59,550 --> 00:43:06,780
responsive preview module that i showed

00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:10,640
is definitely not in the g8 dev at all

00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:13,740
it's just a proposed patch at the moment

00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:15,600
okay so there I mean to say those things

00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:17,490
are in their kind of glosses over the

00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:21,720
fact that there's a lot of code vana and

00:43:17,490 --> 00:43:24,270
we're often working in related modules

00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:26,600
to get our things to to work correctly

00:43:24,270 --> 00:43:29,670
so dealing with fields and dealing with

00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:35,430
taxonomy and all sorts of other pieces

00:43:29,670 --> 00:43:37,380
of code okay and Kelly on the call once

00:43:35,430 --> 00:43:43,290
knew a wide backbone versus Twitter

00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:44,940
bootstrap for example great question yes

00:43:43,290 --> 00:43:49,680
backbone Jas which is different from

00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:51,630
from from Phil Mariela geology yeah

00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:54,120
doing that right so these two things

00:43:51,630 --> 00:43:57,390
aren't incompatible and there's quite a

00:43:54,120 --> 00:44:00,780
lively community around getting a

00:43:57,390 --> 00:44:04,050
Twitter bootstrap a module and theme for

00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:06,090
that ready for Drupal 8 a backbone to us

00:44:04,050 --> 00:44:09,750
represented the one of the more mature

00:44:06,090 --> 00:44:14,550
MVC frameworks for JavaScript there are

00:44:09,750 --> 00:44:17,160
others the the backbone has I think the

00:44:14,550 --> 00:44:21,030
smallest footprint in terms of what it

00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:23,460
does to your to your Dom you know you

00:44:21,030 --> 00:44:25,890
posted something like angular which if I

00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:28,800
remember correctly needs a bit more work

00:44:25,890 --> 00:44:32,730
in terms of massaging the Dom to get it

00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:36,210
to be able to attach views to the models

00:44:32,730 --> 00:44:40,800
and it's one of them I think better

00:44:36,210 --> 00:44:43,260
documented and um you know platforms out

00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:45,660
there it makes very few assumptions it

00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:46,650
doesn't assume a templating language you

00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:47,850
know they're they're just a lot of

00:44:46,650 --> 00:44:49,260
things about it that make it really

00:44:47,850 --> 00:44:52,440
light

00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:55,860
really simple to use you know that being

00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:58,770
said there are lots of other MVC

00:44:55,860 --> 00:45:00,510
frameworks out there and one of the

00:44:58,770 --> 00:45:02,100
things we're discussing among the

00:45:00,510 --> 00:45:05,090
JavaScript team and Drupal is you know

00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:07,350
how do we you know make it possible to

00:45:05,090 --> 00:45:10,200
abstract backbone out if perhaps

00:45:07,350 --> 00:45:11,970
something better comes along so you know

00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:15,660
that we're thinking about modularity

00:45:11,970 --> 00:45:16,950
even in that deck or subsystem now when

00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:23,730
you say what was the what was the

00:45:16,950 --> 00:45:27,330
acronym used I'm MVC MVC yes so it's a

00:45:23,730 --> 00:45:30,180
it means model-view-controller a lot of

00:45:27,330 --> 00:45:31,740
people call these things and bees just

00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:33,710
models and views because there isn't

00:45:31,740 --> 00:45:36,980
really a concept of a controller but I

00:45:33,710 --> 00:45:40,620
think MVC framework is probably the best

00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:42,480
you know name for this type of thing so

00:45:40,620 --> 00:45:45,390
I have been thinking about backbone as

00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:47,640
just you know as just a JavaScript

00:45:45,390 --> 00:45:49,590
library rather than like a front-end

00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:52,830
development framework like bootstrapper

00:45:49,590 --> 00:45:56,730
or ZURB foundation is done is still do

00:45:52,830 --> 00:45:59,460
they have like a you know a full full

00:45:56,730 --> 00:46:01,470
framework around around backbone or is

00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:03,210
it just really a JavaScript library it's

00:46:01,470 --> 00:46:05,340
nothing like a framework like you would

00:46:03,210 --> 00:46:07,260
find in serp condition or Twitter

00:46:05,340 --> 00:46:10,020
bootstrap that provides a lot of the

00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:12,540
front and layout code and base styles

00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:14,430
and widgets and things like that this is

00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:19,290
really when it comes down to it about

00:46:14,430 --> 00:46:20,850
associating data models with HTML on the

00:46:19,290 --> 00:46:24,030
front end and and more and more with

00:46:20,850 --> 00:46:27,570
some auditory announcements we're doing

00:46:24,030 --> 00:46:30,800
a lot with accessibility and hooking

00:46:27,570 --> 00:46:32,820
into these models that drive HTML

00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:34,920
announcement spoken announcements as

00:46:32,820 --> 00:46:37,890
well that inform a screen reader user

00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:39,690
how the page is changing yeah jessie was

00:46:37,890 --> 00:46:41,340
demoing that to greece earlier and it's

00:46:39,690 --> 00:46:43,080
just it's amazing i mean it literally

00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:45,420
goes through your entire page and just

00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:48,780
tells you what what's there and even

00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:50,880
with really intricate changes of context

00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:53,250
like when an overlay opens or when when

00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:55,020
when different kinds of you know

00:46:53,250 --> 00:46:56,640
javascript events are fired on the page

00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:58,770
really pretty cool yeah we'll be talking

00:46:56,640 --> 00:47:00,180
about that in portland in whim if folks

00:46:58,770 --> 00:47:02,580
are there and want to come to that

00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:07,290
session i think it's on wednesday maybe

00:47:02,580 --> 00:47:09,110
tuesday tuesday wednesday great i'm also

00:47:07,290 --> 00:47:12,900
wait what game of you guys been demoing

00:47:09,110 --> 00:47:15,690
today this is just the stock car check

00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:18,840
came out of dribbling okay great and our

00:47:15,690 --> 00:47:24,330
other widely used seems also going to be

00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:27,240
as responsive and da I can't answer that

00:47:24,330 --> 00:47:29,100
I haven't been keeping up with seeming

00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:30,630
efforts to update popular themes to date

00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:33,420
but I believe that most of them probably

00:47:30,630 --> 00:47:36,510
are responsive already like the Zen

00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:39,630
theme and I'm sure Omega all of these

00:47:36,510 --> 00:47:42,300
frameworks and I i I'm certain that they

00:47:39,630 --> 00:47:45,840
all have you know adaptive theme omegas

00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:47,550
& etc they all have been looking at what

00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:49,410
you know what what's being provided by

00:47:47,550 --> 00:47:52,070
the new enhancements like twig for

00:47:49,410 --> 00:47:55,650
instance which is giving a new layout

00:47:52,070 --> 00:47:57,120
sort of functionality or engine I guess

00:47:55,650 --> 00:48:00,480
you'd call it I don't know that's the

00:47:57,120 --> 00:48:04,110
right word but yeah I'm sure that they

00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:06,510
will that they will all be you know

00:48:04,110 --> 00:48:10,650
developing you know any d8 versions that

00:48:06,510 --> 00:48:13,440
are responsive mm-hmm great and so spark

00:48:10,650 --> 00:48:16,170
is already available at the d7 distro if

00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:20,330
you already at p7 site can you just add

00:48:16,170 --> 00:48:20,330
some modules to get this functionality

00:48:21,230 --> 00:48:25,560
yeah we're working very hard to make

00:48:23,790 --> 00:48:30,000
sure that these modules don't depend on

00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:33,110
anything in the spark distro so women I

00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:37,200
are undertaking an effort right now to

00:48:33,110 --> 00:48:38,940
introduce libraries module to the navbar

00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:41,340
module which is the back part of the

00:48:38,940 --> 00:48:43,640
toolbar to the responsive preview module

00:48:41,340 --> 00:48:46,680
to edit so that they can all be used

00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:49,080
independent of each other but when

00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:54,000
combined won't be duplicating assets

00:48:49,080 --> 00:49:00,180
like a backbone and underscore okay and

00:48:54,000 --> 00:49:02,010
on in fact I'm running so right now in

00:49:00,180 --> 00:49:04,350
my screen you'll notice i have an

00:49:02,010 --> 00:49:06,830
in-place edit operations and quick edit

00:49:04,350 --> 00:49:08,790
this is just the Edit module that i

00:49:06,830 --> 00:49:12,580
cloned from

00:49:08,790 --> 00:49:18,130
the projects running in Drupal 7 this is

00:49:12,580 --> 00:49:20,619
not the spark distro okay great and that

00:49:18,130 --> 00:49:26,950
and here's another great question what

00:49:20,619 --> 00:49:28,240
about responsive images right yeah that

00:49:26,950 --> 00:49:30,820
there's work being done on that

00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:31,810
definitely but we are not working on

00:49:30,820 --> 00:49:33,280
that there are other people who are

00:49:31,810 --> 00:49:35,950
doing a lot of really good work on that

00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:37,960
yeah so addicts has been leading that

00:49:35,950 --> 00:49:40,450
effort with the breakpoints module and

00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:41,290
the responsive images module i I didn't

00:49:40,450 --> 00:49:44,320
demo that because they didn't have

00:49:41,290 --> 00:49:49,119
enough time you know that that effort i

00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:51,220
think has larger considerations the the

00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:53,590
picture element specification or

00:49:51,220 --> 00:49:56,890
proposed proposal for specification is

00:49:53,590 --> 00:49:58,869
kind of stalled you know the effort to

00:49:56,890 --> 00:50:02,369
deal with responsive images at the user

00:49:58,869 --> 00:50:05,109
agent level is kind of in tatters and

00:50:02,369 --> 00:50:06,850
what Drupal 8 might ship with will be

00:50:05,109 --> 00:50:09,460
some sort of polyfill solution to that

00:50:06,850 --> 00:50:13,000
but we won't have an officially

00:50:09,460 --> 00:50:14,800
supported you know updated specification

00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:16,450
for Drupal 8 which doesn't look like

00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:18,010
those two projects others those two

00:50:16,450 --> 00:50:24,100
efforts are going to online in terms of

00:50:18,010 --> 00:50:26,200
time okay another question here is the

00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:29,980
device simulation already available in

00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:33,430
d7 because that was pretty cool anything

00:50:29,980 --> 00:50:37,780
I find it yes it is so it's the

00:50:33,430 --> 00:50:40,150
responsive preview module just right

00:50:37,780 --> 00:50:43,630
there on triple dot org slash project /

00:50:40,150 --> 00:50:46,690
responsive preview and this is a stock

00:50:43,630 --> 00:50:48,250
d7 site there is a block that you have

00:50:46,690 --> 00:50:51,820
to play is to get the controls for that

00:50:48,250 --> 00:50:55,810
and that's the the module running in

00:50:51,820 --> 00:50:57,250
Drupal 7 wait yeah I will they're a

00:50:55,810 --> 00:51:01,060
couple of others there are a couple

00:50:57,250 --> 00:51:02,650
other preview modules as well I think to

00:51:01,060 --> 00:51:05,770
other developers started this within a

00:51:02,650 --> 00:51:06,910
week of when we started this everyone

00:51:05,770 --> 00:51:09,340
just had the same idea at the same time

00:51:06,910 --> 00:51:10,840
it was pretty amazing so you know if

00:51:09,340 --> 00:51:12,690
there's some other ones out there that I

00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:14,650
think are a bit flashy r and perhaps

00:51:12,690 --> 00:51:18,640
check them all out and see which one you

00:51:14,650 --> 00:51:19,930
like the most all right we just a couple

00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:21,080
minutes left are you guys ready for a

00:51:19,930 --> 00:51:25,670
lightning round

00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:32,210
sure okay does edit in-place work with

00:51:25,670 --> 00:51:35,960
translation it will that's our next task

00:51:32,210 --> 00:51:38,240
yep okay great and where is the best

00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:44,240
place for novice contributors to jump in

00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:48,110
with bark that's a great question so we

00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:49,460
have a couple with the individual

00:51:48,110 --> 00:51:51,410
projects if you want to jump into the

00:51:49,460 --> 00:51:53,450
modules themselves their issue queues

00:51:51,410 --> 00:51:56,180
for each one of those modules we look at

00:51:53,450 --> 00:52:00,190
them once a week or more often respond

00:51:56,180 --> 00:52:03,320
to them and we really appreciate people

00:52:00,190 --> 00:52:06,170
logging bugs and patches for the Drupal

00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:07,910
7 versions because those inform the

00:52:06,170 --> 00:52:09,050
development of the two blade versions if

00:52:07,910 --> 00:52:11,060
you want to get involved in the

00:52:09,050 --> 00:52:13,250
triple-eight work every major effort

00:52:11,060 --> 00:52:15,770
toolbar edit has what we call a meta

00:52:13,250 --> 00:52:18,320
page so if you search for bracket meta

00:52:15,770 --> 00:52:20,420
and bracket you're going to find a page

00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:23,180
where we list all of the sub issues that

00:52:20,420 --> 00:52:24,860
relate to those efforts and those are

00:52:23,180 --> 00:52:27,080
good jumping-off places so do an issue

00:52:24,860 --> 00:52:29,240
search for Open bracket meta close

00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:33,980
bracket you know edit or toolbar and

00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:35,630
you'll find those men issues great so we

00:52:33,980 --> 00:52:37,940
feel have a few more questions left in

00:52:35,630 --> 00:52:39,710
the queue and what I would i need to put

00:52:37,940 --> 00:52:42,020
you on the spot would you mind very much

00:52:39,710 --> 00:52:44,210
if we collected those and perhaps in our

00:52:42,020 --> 00:52:45,740
blog post summary you know we could

00:52:44,210 --> 00:52:48,380
shows that with you guys and get some

00:52:45,740 --> 00:52:50,060
answers from from you and put those up

00:52:48,380 --> 00:52:52,520
on the blog post so we get them all

00:52:50,060 --> 00:52:57,680

00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:59,270
