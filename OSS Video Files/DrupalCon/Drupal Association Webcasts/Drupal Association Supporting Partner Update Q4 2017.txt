dr. present okay so let me just go ahead

00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:10,410
and dive in up of course before we do I

00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:13,860
want to thank all of our supporting

00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:15,450
partners for stepping up and giving back

00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:18,000
to the community by becoming a

00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:20,880
supporting partner all of your funds

00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,680
were going towards drupal.org and making

00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,260
sure our engineers are updating our

00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:27,359
tools and the infrastructure is funded

00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:29,849
all the great things that we do on the

00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:33,090
site is because of you and I want to

00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:35,190
thank our signature partners this is the

00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:36,899
top level that's been growing over the

00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:39,660
last year since we introduced it and

00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:42,690
we're just very thankful for everyone's

00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:44,969
support and we're also glad that we've

00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:49,110
been able to update the program so that

00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:50,700
each level gets more business value well

00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:55,050
we know that everyone is contributing

00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:59,000
back to make sure drupal.org start you

00:00:55,050 --> 00:01:01,559
know stays on and evolves we know that

00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,910
you could be doing many things with your

00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:04,799
money and we want to make sure we

00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:06,720
provide as much business value as we can

00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,729
so we've been featuring a lot of great

00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,619
case studies off of the front page and

00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:14,939
providing other kinds of value like that

00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:17,490
and our supporter base just continues to

00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:20,520
grow with so many committed companies

00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:23,100
around the world and it's not just the

00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:27,750
Drupal shops or digital agencies but we

00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:29,340
also have many ISVs technology companies

00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:31,560
that integrate with drupal as well as

00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:34,259
hosting companies that are working with

00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:38,130
us they recognize that they are part of

00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:39,960
our ecosystem and generating income for

00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:43,409
their company by working with Drupal and

00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:45,180
so they want to give back as well so we

00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:47,579
really thank you for all of your support

00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:50,310
and now let's go into some Drupal

00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:52,530
Association news on December 12th

00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:54,689
there's going to be a public board

00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:57,479
meeting followed by an executive session

00:01:54,689 --> 00:02:00,840
and it's a rather important one it's the

00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:03,930
time of year when we get new board

00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:06,840
members every year November board seats

00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:08,670
expire and so we are using this

00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:13,740
opportunity to make a few changes I just

00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:16,850
want to call out so Tiffany Faris

00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:19,050
Jeff wall Poole and Bess upon mu are

00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:22,230
rolling off to the board after many

00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:24,330
years of great dedicated service to the

00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:26,160
community which we are incredibly

00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:28,440
thankful for and it's now time to

00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:34,950
replace those seats so we'll be voting

00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:37,170
on the new slate of nominees and we are

00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:39,900
also going to be making some other

00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:41,580
changes so for example Jacob reading

00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:44,940
will be the new treasurer as Tiffany

00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:47,430
rolls off Mike lamb will remain as the

00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:50,310
secretary but we are going to make a

00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:52,620
change with the chair so grease Butte

00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:54,840
arch has been the chair of the triple

00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:56,640
Association since the beginning he wants

00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:59,340
to still stay very involved with the

00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:04,530
Drupal Association but he's decided that

00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:08,070
the chair officer position can be taken

00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:10,710
over by an independent like neutral

00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:12,470
party something that the community had

00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:15,600
asked for and he was happy to do that

00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:18,300
and so we are gonna be voting on

00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:22,320
bringing an Adam Goodman into the chair

00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:24,780
position this is a great change

00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:26,850
he has been advising the board on and

00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:29,520
off for eight years helping us evolve

00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:32,010
from a volunteer board where the board

00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:34,290
actually used to put on Drupal con and

00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:37,230
has helped them move to a strategic

00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:39,690
board and we can now even more with him

00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:41,400
as the chair it's an interim type of

00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:46,820
chair position he really wants to just

00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:50,310
orient the board to be used to having

00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:53,280
you know a nominated chair on the board

00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:54,930
versus the founder of the project and we

00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,940
also can continue to evolve on the

00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:58,320
strategy side to with this help so

00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:01,380
that's going to be a really great change

00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:04,680
to bring him on board we do need to

00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:07,110
update our bylaws he is a paid

00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:09,450
consultant and we currently have bylaws

00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:12,030
that say no one can get paid so we are

00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:14,070
doing a change to the bylaws and a vote

00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:18,450
to the bylaws to allow us to pay him for

00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:20,940
this interim role and while we're voting

00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:21,960
on the bylaws we just looked at all of

00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:23,310
it and just wanted to update it so

00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:25,230
there's some other changes that we're

00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:27,180
going to be voting on some real basic

00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:29,160
things there's a list of committees

00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:30,750
that we don't use anymore so we're just

00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:34,229
cleaning that up and some other things

00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:39,539
like it says we can only use basically

00:04:34,229 --> 00:04:41,250
telephones for our you know virtual

00:04:39,539 --> 00:04:42,690
meetings but obviously we have things

00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:45,210
like zoom now so just really simple

00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:46,650
changes like that but you'll see that in

00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:49,800
the public board meeting that we'll be

00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:52,800
voting on that as well some other things

00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:55,860
to note about our board is that we have

00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:59,880
12 seats altogether 10 of them are

00:04:55,860 --> 00:05:05,970
nominated and two are elected by the

00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:11,340
community so we are going to vote to

00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:13,470
look at how to get more everyone's from

00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:15,620
the community on the board but how can

00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:18,180
we get more of the community elected

00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:22,349
directors on the board get some more

00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:25,199
diversity in terms of regional

00:05:22,349 --> 00:05:28,530
representation as well as different

00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:29,729
kinds of personas and so there's two

00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:31,380
things that we're voting on that you

00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:35,310
should know about one is more

00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:37,289
operational which is basically board

00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:40,080
members that are nominated they expire

00:05:37,289 --> 00:05:41,760
and their seat expires in November but

00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,770
if you are community elected that cycles

00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:45,330
different and expires in January and

00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:48,389
it's just really hard to manage so we're

00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:52,650
gonna vote to extend Shamala and Ryan's

00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:54,630
rama's seat to expire in the November of

00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:56,310
the year that their term is over rather

00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:56,759
than January and that way we can just on

00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:59,400
board

00:05:56,759 --> 00:06:03,539
and exit everyone together but the other

00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:07,820
one is the way the bylaws are written we

00:06:03,539 --> 00:06:14,000
can actually have for community at-large

00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:19,830
positions rather than two and we will

00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:23,699
look to have for community at-large

00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:25,020
board members join us in November and so

00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:26,669
that is a change that we're going to

00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:30,419
discuss and make sure that's something

00:06:26,669 --> 00:06:32,639
that we can support operationally but

00:06:30,419 --> 00:06:33,960
all of these changes mean one thing that

00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:36,240
I think is important for you to know

00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:38,789
which is we're going to change when we

00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,470
do community elections and we've been

00:06:38,789 --> 00:06:42,840
doing that I'm kind of starting now

00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:44,670
through March somewhere in that

00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:46,170
timeframe is when we normally do the

00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:48,090
community elections that we can get

00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:53,910
someone on board to come to their first

00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:56,310
in-person retreat in the DrupalCon in

00:06:53,910 --> 00:07:00,120
North America but because we want this

00:06:56,310 --> 00:07:02,220
person to roll in in November then we're

00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:06,150
going to change our community elections

00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:08,880
to the summer so just note that change

00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:11,250
let your staff know and we will be

00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:14,040
promoting this communicating it out and

00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:17,670
running those elections this summer and

00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:19,260
just a few things to note about Adam

00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:22,260
Goodman I mentioned how he's moving into

00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:23,880
the chair position he's very excited to

00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:25,230
get to know the community better I mean

00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:29,390
he's worked with the community on an

00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:32,910
office he's been advising the board he

00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:35,460
brings to the table just loads of

00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:37,560
experience he is a professor at

00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:41,400
Northwestern University in Chicago in

00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:43,740
the US and he is an advisor on

00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:46,919
leadership and advises nonprofits and

00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:50,490
companies all over the world so he's

00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:52,020
just been a really great partner and I'm

00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:53,610
excited to work with him but more

00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:56,940
importantly I'm excited for him to meet

00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:58,950
you and to understand your business's

00:07:56,940 --> 00:08:01,620
needs because the board needs to focus

00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:04,350
on that and so I'll be setting up

00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:06,690
interviews between Adam and our

00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:07,979
supporting partners so you might be

00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:09,450
getting an email from me in the next

00:08:07,979 --> 00:08:10,800
couple weeks where we could set

00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:13,290
something up because he would really

00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,940
like to hear what the what the needs and

00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:19,560
opportunities are that the Drupal

00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:22,260
Association should be focusing on in in

00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:24,450
other news kind of shifting from the

00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:27,390
board with the does strategy over to the

00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:30,960
staff that does the operations we are

00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:34,320
growing as a team so are we recently

00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:37,669
hired Rachel Lawson who lives in the UK

00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:40,349
she has been the community for 11 years

00:08:37,669 --> 00:08:42,240
as deep knowledge in how our community

00:08:40,349 --> 00:08:44,130
works has played many important

00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:47,550
volunteer roles from community working

00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:50,850
group to sprint mentor she's a technical

00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:52,390
background and we have asked Rachel to

00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:54,370
be the community liaison

00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:55,839
between the Drupal Association and the

00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:57,990
community so they can have more of this

00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:00,040
by directional multi-directional

00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:02,860
conversation and really to foster

00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:04,750
understanding and understanding of what

00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:06,370
the DA is doing understanding the needs

00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:09,220
of the community making sure that we're

00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:11,050
really is agile as possible in terms of

00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:13,990
meeting the needs of the community and

00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:16,810
then on the other hand many of you have

00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:18,760
worked with Rachel Friesen who has been

00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:22,410
our Events Director overseeing Drupal

00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:26,560
con and she is leading the organization

00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:28,600
mid-january to go explore the world and

00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:30,760
take on this whole new exciting

00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:33,130
adventure so we're certainly really sad

00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:35,170
to see her go but we are excited for

00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:39,610
Brook Candelaria to join us as the

00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:43,560
conference director she has a deep

00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:46,529
knowledge and experience in tech events

00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:49,000
working with all kinds of tech events

00:09:46,529 --> 00:09:50,950
including open source ones like Linux

00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:54,459
world and she's worked in open source

00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:58,690
communities so it's great that Brooke

00:09:54,459 --> 00:10:01,930
can bring to us this whole tech event

00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:04,959
experience and marry it with Amanda

00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:06,399
Ganzer who handles our programming she

00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:08,589
has a great understanding of the Drupal

00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:12,250
community so we can really elevate

00:10:08,589 --> 00:10:15,399
Drupal con so it is a premier tech event

00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:18,130
but without losing what is so great

00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:19,959
about our community in our culture so

00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:24,010
I'm really excited for Brooke to come

00:10:19,959 --> 00:10:25,930
and and start evolving Drupal con she's

00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:28,060
also gonna be working with me on the

00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:30,370
licensing program as some of you may

00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:33,579
know we are looking to license Drupal

00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:36,250
con to a European entity she is going to

00:10:33,579 --> 00:10:38,769
be helping me with that process and

00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:41,589
there's just so much more that we can do

00:10:38,769 --> 00:10:44,470
we talked about how do we do customer

00:10:41,589 --> 00:10:46,149
roundtables and how do we do events in a

00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:48,070
box that can be shared around the world

00:10:46,149 --> 00:10:50,050
so lots of lots of different ideas

00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:51,910
already coming within just a few weeks

00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:55,350
of her working here so very excited

00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:58,029
about both of these new hires

00:10:55,350 --> 00:11:01,000
speaking of Drupal con the next one is

00:10:58,029 --> 00:11:06,170
in Nashville Tennessee April 9th to 13th

00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:08,660
and really interested

00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:12,530
in having this event be a step forward

00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:16,520
in an evolution for DrupalCon in the

00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:19,520
past it's very much been focused on the

00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:21,170
people who build a website or an

00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:24,380
application whatever you're building

00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:25,100
something amazing with Drupal and that

00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:29,320
is good

00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:32,660
it's obviously also focused on the

00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:34,130
contribution side of of the project and

00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:36,740
really accelerating the project by

00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:39,110
bringing people forward by bringing

00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:42,290
people together excuse me and that is

00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:44,870
really good because that persona the

00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:48,230
builders the front-end back-end the

00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:50,150
DevOps the project manager all that

00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:52,580
these people that make up teams that

00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:54,590
build something amazing with Drupal play

00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:56,240
such a critical role especially since

00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:57,770
they awesome you know there's a certain

00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:01,910
percentage of them that are also

00:11:57,770 --> 00:12:05,090
contributing to the software so I'm very

00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:09,170
proud of the base that we have we do

00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:12,950
want to expand the way I see it is that

00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:16,070
for a visitor to a website or a user of

00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:19,250
an app is getting a digital experience

00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:22,040
that's not just based on the builders

00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:24,050
expertise there's a wholesome like

00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:26,060
supply chain a whole team of people made

00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:27,080
up with different personas you've got

00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:30,230
the decision-maker

00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:32,240
you've got the builders of course you've

00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:34,010
got someone leading the builders and

00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,930
then of course was this building you

00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:38,630
need the people on the marketing side

00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:41,690
who are going to really bring that site

00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:44,330
alight alive with content and marketing

00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:46,040
campaigns and they're focused on being

00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:49,160
able to have agile messaging and

00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:50,720
conversions and strong SEO and we need

00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:53,300
to bring those people into the fold

00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:55,100
because as I like to say no chain is

00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:59,000
stronger than its weakest link and if we

00:12:55,100 --> 00:13:00,890
want Drupal to be adopted and have a

00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,690
strong foothold in any account we need

00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:04,130
to be talking to all of these touch

00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:05,780
points along the supply chain of

00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:07,760
creating a digital experience for a

00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:09,920
visitor we would like to bring them all

00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:12,170
under the same tent and provide really

00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:13,730
unique experiences for all of them but

00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:16,070
then also create experiences where they

00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:18,149
can interact and kind of break down the

00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:20,010
walls between the personas

00:13:18,149 --> 00:13:23,010
and so you're going to start seeing some

00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:25,610
changes at DrupalCon this year and then

00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:29,070
we'll be able to keep evolving over time

00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:31,410
this is going to be probably the first

00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:33,630
true pecan with so many personas served

00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:35,190
so these are the different tracks and

00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:36,950
what you're going to see are many

00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:39,120
familiar ones that are very technical

00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:41,010
from your back-end development in

00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:46,230
front-end development DevOps the ones we

00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:49,560
talked about but we also have some other

00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:52,620
ones you know like the business owners

00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:54,779
that's always been served as well as

00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:58,079
project managers site builders these are

00:13:54,779 --> 00:14:00,240
all ones that we've been talking to at

00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:03,329
every Drupal con but we're starting to

00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:06,060
lean into a few other areas one is

00:14:03,329 --> 00:14:07,649
technical leadership we did some

00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:11,279
research and talked to directors of

00:14:07,649 --> 00:14:12,450
engineering at different end users but

00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:16,110
we really want to have them come to

00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:18,600
Drupal con and they say well I've come

00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:19,950
once but really it's for my team and we

00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:22,079
want to make it so the technical

00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:23,790
leadership at the end-user or even at

00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:25,170
the digital agency wants to come again

00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:27,510
and again and there's something for them

00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:29,450
and we asked what they would want is

00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:32,490
well we want something that's gonna like

00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:35,370
pick our heads up and help us blue sky

00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:36,990
some new ideas and thinking but also and

00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:41,459
that comes in the form of case studies

00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:43,350
and talking to peers but that also comes

00:14:41,459 --> 00:14:45,450
in the form of how could I be a better

00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:47,640
manager huh can I get the most out of my

00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:49,290
team there's a need for that so the

00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:50,760
technical leadership track is going to

00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:55,350
focus on that for the directors of

00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:57,600
engineers and and then on the marketing

00:14:55,350 --> 00:15:03,060
side we are starting to move into that

00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:05,010
with UX and content editors content

00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:07,709
strategy content editors so here we go

00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:10,770
right here and I'm open he's your

00:15:07,709 --> 00:15:12,329
experience sorry so we will be focusing

00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:15,120
on that with this Drupal con and time I

00:15:12,329 --> 00:15:16,800
love to start seeing a track for

00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,839
marketing people to come in and really

00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:22,010
understand Drupal's value in terms of

00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:26,029
TCO and SEO and all those great acronyms

00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:27,870
so I'm just very excited about this

00:15:26,029 --> 00:15:30,930
evolution of Drupal

00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:33,450
because at the end of the day Drupal has

00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:34,920
many different types of people in its

00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:37,410
community and we need to serve all of

00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:39,810
them another thing I want to point out

00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:42,620
is that there are some themes that will

00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:45,600
be resonating through Drupal con

00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:48,029
ambitious digital experience is one and

00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:50,160
the other one is headless we really have

00:15:48,029 --> 00:15:53,550
opportunities to grow in both areas and

00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:56,460
at Drupal con Vienna the DRI's note

00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:59,610
focused a lot on what is an ambitious

00:15:56,460 --> 00:16:02,100
digital experience and why headless is

00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:03,960
such a growth opportunity for us so

00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:07,680
you're going to see in all of the tracks

00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:09,450
case studies and that case studies will

00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:11,610
range from technical to business but

00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:14,910
you're also going to see a big focus on

00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:21,120
headless every track will also have some

00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:23,940
form of JavaScript content and some will

00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:26,010
be very technical but in the when you

00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:27,510
look at horizons it's really about

00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:28,860
pushing boundaries with headless and

00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:30,839
what can where are some amazing things

00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:32,820
that we could do or should be doing what

00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:36,410
are we doing with smart cities you know

00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:39,300
all these big topics that futurists are

00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:43,920
covering now and Drupal can play a role

00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:46,709
in that and so lots of really big themes

00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:49,220
that will be kind of percolating through

00:16:46,709 --> 00:16:55,110
all of these tracks to look out for

00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:58,680
excuse me so I certainly encourage you

00:16:55,110 --> 00:17:01,350
to check out these tracks think about

00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:03,209
attending of course many of you are

00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:06,449
sponsoring and we greatly appreciate

00:17:03,209 --> 00:17:07,890
that support we have some new summits

00:17:06,449 --> 00:17:09,689
just so you know if you want to get in

00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:12,240
front of business leaders who are

00:17:09,689 --> 00:17:13,620
talking about this basically

00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,689
peer-to-peer networking peer-to-peer

00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:17,790
learning around different industries so

00:17:15,689 --> 00:17:19,319
if you want to get a real focus I

00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:20,670
encourage you to check out the summit so

00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:22,800
we have a new one called decoupled

00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:24,870
summit that's gonna focus just on those

00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:27,120
kinds of headless experiences decoupled

00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:29,610
experiences so I definitely like to

00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:31,410
highlight that one so I feel that the

00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:34,020
sponsors are getting some really special

00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:37,770
value in those kinds of intimate

00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:40,960
meetings so be sure to submit your

00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:43,149
sessions share your knowledge the

00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:48,220
date to keep in mind is January 17th

00:17:43,149 --> 00:17:50,470
that's when call for papers closes we

00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:53,830
also want to call out Drupal Europe

00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:56,440
events so we're taking the year off for

00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:58,330
Drupal con and Europe so that we can

00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:59,769
come up with a new operational model

00:17:58,330 --> 00:18:03,580
that's more sustainable and adds more

00:17:59,769 --> 00:18:06,669
value to that region in the meantime 20

00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:10,360
in 2018 the community in Europe is

00:18:06,669 --> 00:18:13,169
building an event for the community

00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:16,419
it's called Drupal Europe 2018 and

00:18:13,169 --> 00:18:17,950
they're making really good progress and

00:18:16,419 --> 00:18:19,990
they just told me yesterday that they

00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:22,869
look to announce the venue in the new

00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:24,100
year roughly January and so just keep an

00:18:22,869 --> 00:18:26,529
ear out for that will certainly be

00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:28,690
amplifying that information I'm sure

00:18:26,529 --> 00:18:30,519
many of you and Europe are eager to find

00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:32,499
out what to do and how you can support

00:18:30,519 --> 00:18:37,330
them with sponsorship which I highly

00:18:32,499 --> 00:18:39,369
encourage as well and we are working

00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:44,200
very hard on coming up with a structure

00:18:39,369 --> 00:18:46,960
for Drupal con licensing and that would

00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:50,019
be so that Drupal con can come back to

00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:54,549
Europe in 2019 they're working with this

00:18:50,019 --> 00:18:56,950
amazing committee of European event

00:18:54,549 --> 00:18:58,600
leaders and we are really close to

00:18:56,950 --> 00:19:02,999
putting something out to the community

00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:06,039
so they understand how and when to

00:19:02,999 --> 00:19:08,379
submit their proposals to be the

00:19:06,039 --> 00:19:10,869
licensee to be the event organiser for

00:19:08,379 --> 00:19:12,789
Drupal con 2019 so I just want to let

00:19:10,869 --> 00:19:14,529
you know if you're if you're interested

00:19:12,789 --> 00:19:17,169
or you know any entities out there that

00:19:14,529 --> 00:19:19,210
have expressed interest to keep their

00:19:17,169 --> 00:19:22,570
eye out from mid-december when I'll be

00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:24,399
sharing that information you know and I

00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:29,110
think that's it for Europe so Tim I'll

00:19:24,399 --> 00:19:30,190
hand it over to you awesome so yeah I'm

00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:32,350
going to go ahead and give an update on

00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:34,480
drupal.org this is going to be a little

00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:36,279
bit different from some prior updates in

00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,690
that I'm gonna be talking certainly

00:19:36,279 --> 00:19:40,409
about some of the features and and

00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:45,129
things that we've been working on since

00:19:40,409 --> 00:19:48,399
our last kind of public conversation in

00:19:45,129 --> 00:19:51,279
September but I'm also going to talk

00:19:48,399 --> 00:19:53,109
about some Drupal projects licensing

00:19:51,279 --> 00:19:54,340
policy issues that have recently been

00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:56,679
resolved some long-standing

00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:58,000
questions and give sort of the basic

00:19:56,679 --> 00:20:00,850
information about that and the

00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,620
clarifications that are in place and

00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:04,630
I'll get that in the second half of my

00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:07,120
my little conversation here and feel

00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:11,049
free to ask any questions at that point

00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:13,770
Megan go ahead next slide we'll start

00:20:11,049 --> 00:20:16,480
with the feature changes obviously as

00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:17,950
most of you know composers become kind

00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:20,830
of an integral part of Drupal 8

00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:23,080
workflows for most organizations but if

00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:25,090
you are not kind of deeply tied into the

00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:27,730
community that may not be as visible to

00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:29,529
you or hasn't been in the past anyway

00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:31,690
and it's been a little bit hard to wrap

00:20:29,529 --> 00:20:32,799
your head around those new workflows

00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:37,029
there are a number of initiatives

00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:41,200
underway to make this easier for people

00:20:37,029 --> 00:20:43,480
who are building projects on Drupal one

00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:45,850
of them a fairly simple one is that

00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:48,760
we're now including instructions for how

00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:51,399
you install projects using composer

00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:53,500
directly on the project pages as well as

00:20:51,399 --> 00:20:56,140
linking to in context documentation

00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:57,730
about how that works that's a small step

00:20:56,140 --> 00:21:00,549
and in addition to that we're thinking

00:20:57,730 --> 00:21:03,490
about and planning tools for site

00:21:00,549 --> 00:21:07,380
builders that might be integrated

00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:10,750
directly into Drupal's admin interface

00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:12,700
that can help people manage composer

00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:14,260
based sites and a little bit of a more

00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:16,149
site builder friendly way so that's an

00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:19,210
initiative that we're just beginning to

00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:21,370
work on with the core maintainer

00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:23,710
if you could go to the next slide we've

00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:25,510
been an announcement that you probably

00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:27,460
saw in one of our previous updates is

00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:29,220
that we just finally cleaned up some

00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:32,649
parts of drupal.org that had been

00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:34,960
existing with bare slash node slash

00:21:32,649 --> 00:21:37,480
random string of number URLs for such a

00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:39,640
long time and had been hard to shout

00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:42,700
across a sprint table and hard to manage

00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:44,710
and contribution and hard to ok and

00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:46,149
analyzed in our own analytics when we're

00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:48,070
looking at the activity on triple the

00:21:46,149 --> 00:21:49,570
door so we've just pushed out some more

00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:49,960
friendly URLs for different content

00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:52,899
types

00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:56,169
so issues now have friendly URLs and

00:21:52,899 --> 00:21:57,789
we'll you know if an issues moved from

00:21:56,169 --> 00:22:00,490
project project those aliases are

00:21:57,789 --> 00:22:02,440
automatically updated case studies have

00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:05,350
friendly URLs as to forum topics and

00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:07,330
we've created a few search shortcuts so

00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:08,140
if you do know a node ID and enter it

00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:10,150
directly in the search

00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:13,450
you'll be taken straight there and you

00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:15,910
can even use a very short drupelet org

00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:17,500
/i slash issue ID if you want to jump

00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:22,360
directly to an issue without using these

00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:25,300
longer search friendly URLs in addition

00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:26,980
we've been spending some time I want to

00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:28,720
call out miksa logic Ryan on our team

00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:30,790
for his great work with G people CI

00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:32,590
obviously is one of the big services

00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:34,570
that we provide to the project is

00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:35,770
testing and test coverage and there's a

00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:38,620
number of different things that we've

00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:44,080
been doing from providing environment

00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:45,520
testing for PHP 7.2 to just updating and

00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:48,130
troubleshooting various aspects of the

00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:49,560
system trying to make it run faster but

00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:53,950
one of the most important things is

00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:55,810
because Drupal C is funded entirely by

00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:57,700
the kind of sponsorship that you provide

00:22:55,810 --> 00:22:59,410
we want to make sure that your dollars

00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:00,610
go farther go as far as they can in

00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:04,870
support of the project and project

00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:07,420
testing so Amazon Web Services recently

00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:12,070
instituted a per second billing option

00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:13,780
for AWS so we refactored our drupal CI

00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:15,910
dispatcher to take advantage of that per

00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:17,200
second billing option and we rewrote the

00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:19,330
plugin that we use to search across

00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:21,760
multiple availability regions to find

00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:24,310
the cheapest instances that we can and

00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:26,320
this means a few advantages among other

00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:28,630
things it means that we can we don't

00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:30,100
have to wait to reuse unused minutes on

00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:31,660
test spots so we can provision new ones

00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:33,730
right away which actually means tests

00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:36,220
are completing faster and it also means

00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:37,840
that we're not paying for a spot

00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:38,980
instance time that we're not using which

00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:41,440
means that we're saving an estimated

00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:44,170
between 20 and 30 percent a month on

00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:46,420
what our CI costs were even just a month

00:23:44,170 --> 00:23:47,890
ago so that's going to help make fit

00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:49,480
sponsorship dollars that you provide go

00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:52,410
farther and allow us to do more with

00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:56,140
them in different ways

00:23:52,410 --> 00:23:59,650
next slide Megan a few things that you

00:23:56,140 --> 00:24:01,710
may have seen as well obviously we work

00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:03,940
with our partners tag 1 consulting for

00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:06,160
infrastructure maintenance and support

00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:08,110
for drupal.org so you've probably seen

00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:09,850
some messaging on our drupal infra a

00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:11,170
twitter handle about different

00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:13,570
maintenance windows that have occurred

00:24:11,170 --> 00:24:15,670
over the past six weeks or so as we've

00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:19,300
done various updates these have been

00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:21,310
things like general updates machine

00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:21,820
reboots enhancements to our monitoring

00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:24,490
system

00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:26,980
and configuration management various

00:24:24,490 --> 00:24:29,080
things like that we've been pleased that

00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:31,170
for the most part we've been able to do

00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:33,700
these without any significant downtime

00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:38,020
or really any downtime at all in those

00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:40,210
cases we're also working on PCI

00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:42,700
compliance updates and really just

00:24:40,210 --> 00:24:44,920
reducing the scope of what we manage for

00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:48,370
PCI and when it comes to accepting

00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:50,440
membership transactions or DrupalCon

00:24:48,370 --> 00:24:52,050
ticket purchases and all those sorts of

00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:54,610
things and so that's something that

00:24:52,050 --> 00:24:57,960
you'll hear us continue to talk about as

00:24:54,610 --> 00:24:57,960
we finish that process up

00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:02,539
switch over to the kind of new topic for

00:25:00,679 --> 00:25:04,360
for these calls something we haven't

00:25:02,539 --> 00:25:06,500
really talked about before and that's

00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:08,360
licensing policy for the Drupal project

00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:11,390
in Drupal fedora and I mean license in

00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:13,730
terms of the GPL license so there were

00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:15,669
several major questions that you may or

00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:17,779
may not know have been hanging out for

00:25:15,669 --> 00:25:19,580
honestly a couple of years that the

00:25:17,779 --> 00:25:21,529
project has been trying to resolve and

00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:24,169
some of these are very straightforward

00:25:21,529 --> 00:25:26,480
but haven't been explicitly clarified

00:25:24,169 --> 00:25:31,370
and some of them were a little a little

00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:32,809
bit more open to interpretation and have

00:25:31,370 --> 00:25:35,299
just needed some firm answers

00:25:32,809 --> 00:25:37,549
so one of the more basic straightforward

00:25:35,299 --> 00:25:40,039
questions was a was of course explicitly

00:25:37,549 --> 00:25:42,260
affirming can code be licensed under G

00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:44,419
could have GPL compatible licenses

00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:46,700
included in Drupal projects and the

00:25:44,419 --> 00:25:49,100
answer to that has always been but to

00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:51,470
explicitly say it is yes you can use any

00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:53,269
GPL compatible code in a Drupal adora

00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:55,700
project it's just that when it's really

00:25:53,269 --> 00:26:00,320
distributed from Drupal it org it's

00:25:55,700 --> 00:26:01,909
distributed GPL or later and that's just

00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:03,620
a basic clause of the GPL that we're

00:26:01,909 --> 00:26:07,269
finally clarifying a little bit more

00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:10,070
clearly in our project on the next slide

00:26:07,269 --> 00:26:13,070
the next question was can Drupal

00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:15,350
projects include GPL incompatible non

00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:17,000
code assets and this is something that's

00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:18,409
been a point of confusion for a lot of

00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:22,789
people whether it's project maintainer

00:26:18,409 --> 00:26:26,350
x' site builders agencies it's it's

00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:28,940
whether or not assets that are not

00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:32,630
derivatives of the work of the code that

00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:34,340
is GPL can be non GPL and this is

00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:36,559
important because of course font

00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:37,940
licenses and icon copyright and

00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:40,669
licensing and all that kind of stuff

00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:42,919
just on a different spectrum from code

00:26:40,669 --> 00:26:45,769
licensing and are usually not designed

00:26:42,919 --> 00:26:48,710
to work in tandem with each other so

00:26:45,769 --> 00:26:52,789
there's an ik there's an explicit clause

00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:56,210
in the GPL which states that any works

00:26:52,789 --> 00:26:58,279
that aren't based on the GPL work can be

00:26:56,210 --> 00:27:02,630
packaged and distributed in aggregate

00:26:58,279 --> 00:27:04,909
which GPL code so we were just

00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:06,019
explicitly affirming that yes as long as

00:27:04,909 --> 00:27:07,279
the maintainer has the right to

00:27:06,019 --> 00:27:09,529
distribute whatever those known code

00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:12,500
assets are they may be packaged and

00:27:09,529 --> 00:27:14,090
distributed in aggregate with GPL code

00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:17,210
unless it's just gonna make it easier

00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:20,240
for theme developers and anybody who

00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:21,799
relies on fonts or icon sets or things

00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:28,280
like that to host their projects under

00:27:21,799 --> 00:27:30,789
the little this question related to kind

00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:33,350
of the evolving understanding of what

00:27:30,789 --> 00:27:37,280
composure and dependency management

00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:41,390
means in kind of a modern PHP in drupal

00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:44,630
world as you may know the GPL says that

00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:48,320
you can use any software you like with

00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:51,590
different licenses but if any of it is

00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:53,600
GPL and you package it or distribute it

00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:55,669
together it must be done under the GPL

00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:58,039
and therefore must be GPL compatible and

00:27:55,669 --> 00:28:00,020
that's brought up the question well if

00:27:58,039 --> 00:28:05,840
you have a third-party dependency or a

00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:07,880
library that's non GPL and it gets

00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:10,280
installed by composer when you run a

00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:12,890
composer command is that acceptable or

00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:14,600
is that distribution and after

00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:16,909
consultation with the licensing working

00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:19,700
group and juries and looking at

00:28:16,909 --> 00:28:22,130
different legal opinions we are

00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:24,710
affirming that yes under our

00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:28,159
interpretation GPL does not restrict the

00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:29,840
use of code with other in compatibly

00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:31,730
licensed third-party libraries or

00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:33,610
dependencies just packaging or

00:28:31,730 --> 00:28:36,289
distributions so in short that means

00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:39,559
composer dependencies on libraries with

00:28:36,289 --> 00:28:42,080
other licenses are completely ok but

00:28:39,559 --> 00:28:44,720
drupal.org can't host those in packages

00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:46,490
with the original code so that's an

00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:49,929
important clarification that we're we're

00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:49,929
happy to put out there

00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:55,840
the final question is sort of more of a

00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:58,480
matter of explicitly affirming

00:28:55,840 --> 00:29:00,130
protections for agencies and freelancers

00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:02,740
and anybody who works with the client to

00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:04,540
build sites for them and this is this

00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:07,420
has been an implicitly understood

00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:10,090
assumption about the GPL in a variety of

00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:11,350
projects but the Drupal project hasn't

00:29:10,090 --> 00:29:12,400
really said it out loud

00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:13,990
so we're just going to go ahead and make

00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:16,750
sure that we do that and update that in

00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:18,640
our licensing documentation so but the

00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:22,990
question is basically when an agency

00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:24,250
builds a site excuse me when an agency

00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:26,580
builds a site for a client

00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:31,060
are they distributing code for the

00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:33,580
distribution restrictions of the GPL or

00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:35,680
are they simply acting as the customers

00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:37,960
agent to build that site for them and

00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:43,920
therefore falling under the use Clause

00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:46,420
of the GPL so I just to affirm our

00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:49,240
interpretation and interpretation widely

00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:50,920
across many projects agencies and

00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:53,530
freelancers and other service providers

00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:55,180
are acting as the customers agents they

00:29:53,530 --> 00:29:57,520
are not distributing code just by

00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:59,860
building a client web site they're

00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:03,400
assembling the codebase acting as the

00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:06,760
clients agent so in more simple terms

00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:08,980
again service providers can go ahead and

00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:10,750
use GPL code together with maybe GPL

00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:12,250
incompatible code when they're building

00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:14,500
client site this allows you to do things

00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:17,020
like integrate with third-party api's

00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:19,300
and use libraries and run composer to

00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:21,130
build the client website but you can't

00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:23,170
redistribute all that code with those

00:30:21,130 --> 00:30:25,240
incompatible licenses in aggregate to

00:30:23,170 --> 00:30:27,640
the public as a product or packaged

00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:31,060
because that's when the GPL distribution

00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:32,830
Clause would come into play so those are

00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:35,050
just the important license

00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:36,550
clarifications some of you may have been

00:30:35,050 --> 00:30:38,410
following some of these questions for a

00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:41,800
long time - some of you they may be

00:30:38,410 --> 00:30:43,510
totally new but we're really pleased to

00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:45,490
have the answers and to be updating that

00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:47,350
information and again if you have any

00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:49,750
questions feel free to use the chat or

00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:56,140
use the Q&A panel - to post any

00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:58,870
questions there ok I just see this slide

00:30:56,140 --> 00:31:00,460
it says questions but first it was

00:30:58,870 --> 00:31:04,080
really great and good job with the

00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:07,260
licensing that's uh sometimes a hard

00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:10,200
concepts to have to to share so that was

00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:14,039
really helpful and also great work to

00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:15,269
your team - yeah I'm just pretty excited

00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:16,799
about what you've done this year and

00:31:15,269 --> 00:31:18,149
then also some things that you're gonna

00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:19,529
do next year it's gonna really help

00:31:18,149 --> 00:31:21,799
especially making sure those people that

00:31:19,529 --> 00:31:24,059
kind of couldn't quit got left behind

00:31:21,799 --> 00:31:25,529
with some of the changes in Drupal 8 and

00:31:24,059 --> 00:31:27,179
bringing them back into the fold and

00:31:25,529 --> 00:31:29,159
supporting them I'm just really excited

00:31:27,179 --> 00:31:30,360
that we can work on that yeah I think

00:31:29,159 --> 00:31:31,890
there's a lot of great initiatives

00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:34,350
planned that we're going to require

00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:36,929
collaboration between the Drupal

00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:39,299
Association engineering team and core to

00:31:36,929 --> 00:31:41,370
do things like automatic updates and

00:31:39,299 --> 00:31:43,440
tools for site builders and things to

00:31:41,370 --> 00:31:45,450
make these kind of developer centric

00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:47,539
composer workflows actually accessible

00:31:45,450 --> 00:31:50,760
to this sort of traditional site builder

00:31:47,539 --> 00:31:52,830
type roles so that those folks can

00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:55,500
continue to be first-class citizens of

00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:59,399
the community yeah absolutely

00:31:55,500 --> 00:32:00,960
great ok well I can't see the chat or

00:31:59,399 --> 00:32:05,039
Q&A windows do we have any questions

00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:08,309
from the attendees looks like not at the

00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:11,220
moment all right well then why don't we

00:32:08,309 --> 00:32:13,049
go ahead and close this out keep your
