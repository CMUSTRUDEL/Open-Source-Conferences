make all of our work happen we also have

00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:04,670
our premium technology supporters which

00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:07,229
are is v's technology that supports a

00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:09,420
Drupal and then we have our hosting

00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:11,950
supporters as well I put the premium and

00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:13,890
the supporter level

00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:17,319
alright so let's go ahead into the news

00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:20,140
I talked a lot about the life cycle of

00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:22,569
open source and how it's made up of two

00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:24,370
journeys the contribution journey which

00:02:22,569 --> 00:02:26,709
is where people come in and contribute

00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:28,720
code and documentation so we can release

00:02:26,709 --> 00:02:31,030
the software and I talked about the

00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:34,330
adoption journey which is where an

00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:36,220
evaluator at an end user would come

00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:39,599
learn about Drupal decide why it's right

00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:42,940
for their organization connect with

00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:45,099
service providers third party technology

00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:47,970
hosting companies they can create the

00:02:45,099 --> 00:02:50,470
right solution for themselves and then

00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:52,329
you know hopefully that they start to

00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:54,280
really believe in the ethos of open

00:02:52,329 --> 00:02:56,079
source and what they've created with

00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:57,549
Drupal and they become a contributor

00:02:56,079 --> 00:03:01,780
themselves kind of completing that life

00:02:57,549 --> 00:03:05,680
cycle and the Association really wants

00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:08,560
to strengthen these journeys and we have

00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:11,019
unique ways that we can do this you know

00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:13,000
these journeys are supported by the word

00:03:11,019 --> 00:03:15,849
association does in conjunction with

00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,260
what the community does you know the

00:03:15,849 --> 00:03:21,190
community and the contribution sides

00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:23,200
always helping with mentors and the

00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:25,329
project maintain errs and camp

00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,510
organizers and the community is helping

00:03:25,329 --> 00:03:31,000
on the adoption journey side where

00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:32,530
businesses like XO of a is is going out

00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,430
there and finding out what's the right

00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:38,019
market and what are the needs of the

00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:41,139
businesses and providing the right tools

00:03:38,019 --> 00:03:42,400
and getting to the insights to them so

00:03:41,139 --> 00:03:44,290
that they can make the right decision

00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,840
with Drupal and build something amazing

00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:48,579
with Drupal so now we have that

00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:50,230
happening on a global basis and the

00:03:48,579 --> 00:03:54,519
Association wants to partner with the

00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:56,829
community and by helping both sides of

00:03:54,519 --> 00:03:59,290
those journeys through drupal.org and

00:03:56,829 --> 00:04:01,389
drupalcon and and really what we're

00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:03,579
looking to do is just make sure those

00:04:01,389 --> 00:04:05,410
journeys are really easy to enter into

00:04:03,579 --> 00:04:08,109
that we attract more into those journeys

00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:11,680
and that we make them a very smooth

00:04:08,109 --> 00:04:15,340
journey wherever we can help and then of

00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:17,289
course we want to reward certain ways

00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:19,870
that we need the contribution to be

00:04:17,289 --> 00:04:21,669
happening to move the project forward so

00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:23,440
you know I just like to reiterate those

00:04:21,669 --> 00:04:25,750
kinds of journeys it's kind of the new

00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:28,210
language that we're using to explain

00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:30,160
how we're helping open source and how

00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:32,080
are helping Drupal thrive and especially

00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,060
what where we're focusing on so it's

00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,290
kind of the frame that I use I just want

00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:37,210
to give an up day and some things that

00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:40,570
we're doing to support the contribution

00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:44,680
side yesterday we just announced on

00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:46,870
drupal.org front page news that we have

00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:52,450
assembled a Technical Advisory Committee

00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:57,130
and it consists of Angie Byron motion

00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:59,110
weitzman and Steve francia the first two

00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:01,320
are longtime community members who i'm

00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:06,130
sure many of you know and steve francia

00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:08,169
is on our board has a technical open

00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:11,650
source leadership background has worked

00:05:08,169 --> 00:05:13,720
with MongoDB and was the coo at docker

00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:16,840
and it's now at Google working with the

00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:19,030
go team of and the reason we created

00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:20,410
this committee was to help us and our

00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:22,780
engineering team really look at

00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:24,730
drupal.org understand that contribution

00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:27,160
journey and see how we can modernize it

00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:28,990
we know that there's room for

00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:32,229
improvement there's been a long time

00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:35,620
discussion within our community of what

00:05:32,229 --> 00:05:38,520
we can do to improve our tools and so

00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:42,550
they're working with us to look at our

00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:44,200
existing tool set and compare what we

00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:48,660
could be doing there to fix it versus

00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:51,130
going with a partner a github get lab

00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:53,940
atlassian and so we're starting this

00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:56,350
journey with them on assessing our needs

00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:58,690
figuring out the right way forward and

00:05:56,350 --> 00:06:01,060
it'll be collaborative with staff as

00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:02,830
well as with the community so I just

00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:05,440
want to let you know what we're doing

00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:07,240
there that will be reaching out at some

00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:09,550
point for feedback and I'll make sure

00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:12,040
you know when that happens but I'm

00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:14,680
pretty excited that that we're moving

00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:16,479
down this down this quest as i call it

00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:19,600
because it will be a quest it'll be a

00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:22,210
big overhaul when we finally make a

00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,770
decision and do this work but it's going

00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:28,360
to have some really big impacts for the

00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:30,520
project and i think whichever direction

00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:32,110
we go we go with a vendor I think we're

00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:35,680
going to be able to help them as well

00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:37,510
improve their tooling um and that's

00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,310
going to help other big projects out

00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:41,100
there

00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:42,450
and so you know I think there's just a

00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,800
lot of really great things that are

00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:45,240
going to come out of this project so I

00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:49,950
just want to let you know what we're

00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:53,700
doing there and in case you mysteries is

00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:56,580
blog he and Matthew tift have done a

00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:58,290
study of contribution credits the issue

00:06:56,580 --> 00:07:01,020
credit system that we have on drupal.org

00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:03,090
if you don't know what that is it is

00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:04,950
basically when anyone's contributing

00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:08,910
code they can attribute it to themselves

00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:13,380
so we can recognize their work it can

00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:16,350
also tribute it to their their employer

00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:19,860
so maybe that's one of you as a service

00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:23,430
provider or an ISV or hosting company

00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:25,260
and you can also tribute to a client so

00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:29,670
maybe you're doing this work on behalf

00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:31,470
of Pfizer for example and so we can

00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:34,340
study those attributions now for

00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:37,260
Goodyear and what we found was

00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:39,180
sixty-nine percent of contributions are

00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:41,880
actually sponsored which is a big big

00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:43,800
shift from how the project started when

00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:46,110
it was a bunch of hobbyists that were

00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:48,480
playing with Drupal and contributing on

00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:50,910
their own time so we we now know that

00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:55,320
sponsor contribution is a pretty

00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:57,000
significant thing and it's something

00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:59,730
that's important to notice as we look at

00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:04,340
the contribution and adoption journey it

00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:06,750
just means that you know we have an

00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:08,910
important part of our life cycle it's

00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:11,250
making things go round that we need to

00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:14,280
really understand we need to understand

00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:17,340
who's sponsoring and what's motivating

00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:18,690
them to support contributors because

00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:20,670
we're going to need to really lean into

00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:23,340
that and help make more of that happen

00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:25,530
and this slide is showing the top 30

00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:29,340
organizations who are sponsoring

00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:31,620
contribution it's it's been really

00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:35,700
interesting to see how the issue credit

00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:37,470
system has not only helped bubble up

00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:41,580
this kind of insight to see who the top

00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:43,230
30 are but it off so you know just

00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:45,390
talking with them it's been interesting

00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:47,640
to see about the positive competition

00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:50,050
and the issue credit reward systems

00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:53,830
actually changing behavior

00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:57,640
a great way so you see more companies

00:08:53,830 --> 00:09:00,339
wanting to step up and and make sure

00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:02,260
they are getting you know contribution

00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:03,610
work attributed to them and when the

00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:05,440
reasons is because you get a higher

00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:08,709
ranking in the marketplace and that's

00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:11,079
where evaluator is go to find you and so

00:09:08,709 --> 00:09:14,260
when you look at the top 30 here that's

00:09:11,079 --> 00:09:15,430
just some really interesting things that

00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:17,880
I wanted to point out which is the

00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:21,220
diversity I mean it's globally diverse

00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:23,860
its diverse in terms of who is

00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:27,190
sponsoring what kind of businesses so

00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:29,890
now you have your drupal shops your

00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:33,100
service providers if md systems in

00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:37,990
switzerland who's really not gigantic a

00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:40,899
very passionate very focused and so

00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:44,860
they're as service providers goes there

00:09:40,899 --> 00:09:47,200
they're leading in that area and you can

00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:48,790
see all kinds of different companies

00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,070
that are service providers in here many

00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:53,490
get you know that that you know some

00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:55,690
that are new like I just met melody and

00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:59,260
drupalcon asia and they're out of New

00:09:55,690 --> 00:10:02,079
York City and so that's just you know

00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:05,339
great representation within the Drupal

00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:09,399
shops I think it's also interesting that

00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:13,060
third-party software providers are being

00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:15,279
attributed as well in helping to support

00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:18,040
contribution so we have lingo check in

00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:22,029
here and then of course aquia you know

00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:23,410
their technology company with lift and

00:10:22,029 --> 00:10:25,870
then if you look at the hosting

00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:30,880
companies they're represented in here as

00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:32,200
well um and so you know we just this is

00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,510
the first time we've really had this

00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:37,630
insight so the associations looking at a

00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:40,510
couple things like how do we get more

00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:42,459
companies to help sponsor contribution

00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:45,760
since we know it's such a big part of

00:10:42,459 --> 00:10:47,199
our you know contribution lifecycle and

00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:51,220
then the second thing that we're looking

00:10:47,199 --> 00:10:53,860
at is how do we expand the issue credit

00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:55,750
system right now it's just tracking code

00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:58,120
contribution but we know there's so many

00:10:55,750 --> 00:11:00,980
other kinds of contribution out there

00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:03,680
and many of the other kinds that we

00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:06,199
need so this is one thing that Tim and I

00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:10,100
and the board are looking at right now

00:11:06,199 --> 00:11:13,760
so looking at how do we give someone

00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:17,269
issue credits if they are supporting us

00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:19,490
financially as a supporter um what about

00:11:17,269 --> 00:11:21,680
case studies right now drew blades been

00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:22,970
out for almost a year we really need to

00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:26,029
get case studies out there so we can

00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:28,940
amplify that so how can we incent

00:11:26,029 --> 00:11:30,470
companies like yourself to start writing

00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:32,540
up your case studies and gain new doctor

00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:34,339
org and of course there's so many other

00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:38,329
things that we can consider from camp

00:11:34,339 --> 00:11:39,889
organizers to mentoring and so we're

00:11:38,329 --> 00:11:43,430
looking at all of those things and we'll

00:11:39,889 --> 00:11:46,310
have more updates soon on the adoption

00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:48,829
journey side we're doing several things

00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:51,050
there I mean I think the biggest thing

00:11:48,829 --> 00:11:54,260
we can do is start working on drupal.org

00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:56,899
as a great marketing tool that does a

00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:58,670
better job amplifying all of those

00:11:56,899 --> 00:12:02,899
success stories i just mentioned and

00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:05,380
also connecting evaluators to to you

00:12:02,899 --> 00:12:08,649
especially um to help drive business

00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:11,149
there's no one better position to answer

00:12:08,649 --> 00:12:14,420
customer questions that are drupal shops

00:12:11,149 --> 00:12:15,560
or is fees and hosting companies and so

00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:17,569
those are the kinds of things that we're

00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:20,389
working on but i will let Tim go into

00:12:17,569 --> 00:12:22,100
more detail and history borg update I do

00:12:20,389 --> 00:12:24,350
just want to point out that we are

00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:28,310
crowdsourcing Drupal 8 success stories

00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:30,560
right now for the for Drupal 8 one year

00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:32,300
birthday which is coming up trees wants

00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:34,550
to do a blog post to get people really

00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:36,050
excited and rally around these different

00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:40,760
successes so if you have anything that

00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:42,350
you can share please you know submit it

00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:44,000
through the form the Paul Johnson has

00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:46,940
sent around but we've emailed supporters

00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,850
this as well if you don't have time to

00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:51,079
go dig up that that link then I just

00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:55,579
said it to me and I'll make sure it gets

00:12:51,079 --> 00:12:59,110
degrees so those are some things that

00:12:55,579 --> 00:13:02,870
we're doing currently to improve the

00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:04,339
contribution and adoption journeys one

00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:06,079
other thing that we're working on is

00:13:04,339 --> 00:13:08,360
reassessing the supporter program

00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:12,829
benefits we want to make sure it's high

00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:14,279
value for you and efficient efficient

00:13:12,829 --> 00:13:16,709
use of your time and resources

00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:20,069
we know that feeling all the benefits

00:13:16,709 --> 00:13:22,290
that we provide takes time and it can be

00:13:20,069 --> 00:13:24,449
challenging while you're running a

00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:27,689
business and we've talked with many

00:13:24,449 --> 00:13:29,699
Drupal shops and ISVs and hosting

00:13:27,689 --> 00:13:32,550
companies in this program and they have

00:13:29,699 --> 00:13:35,009
asked for less benefits but more

00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:37,379
high-value ones so we're looking at what

00:13:35,009 --> 00:13:39,509
that could be um they range from

00:13:37,379 --> 00:13:41,779
amplifying your success stories right on

00:13:39,509 --> 00:13:44,249
the front page of drupal.org or PF news

00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:47,040
bubbling that up to the news section on

00:13:44,249 --> 00:13:48,509
the front page and then rewarding you

00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:51,319
with issue credit so that you have a

00:13:48,509 --> 00:13:53,550
higher ranking in the marketplace so

00:13:51,319 --> 00:13:55,350
these are just some things that we're

00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:57,329
exploring right now and we'll be

00:13:55,350 --> 00:14:01,829
reaching out to get more feedback and as

00:13:57,329 --> 00:14:03,749
we you know make sure that as soon as we

00:14:01,829 --> 00:14:05,279
know that this is what is valuable to

00:14:03,749 --> 00:14:09,600
you we'll start making those changes in

00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:12,720
the new year all right with that I'm

00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:15,689
going to hand it over to you Tim awesome

00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:18,839
sounds good so we have a lot of exciting

00:14:15,689 --> 00:14:20,309
things going on on drupal.org and with

00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:21,660
the engineering team here at the

00:14:20,309 --> 00:14:23,879
association and the infrastructure that

00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:25,680
we work on and of course the most

00:14:23,879 --> 00:14:27,449
visible changes you've already seen

00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:29,069
because the biggest thing that we did in

00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:32,790
the last quarter was this change to the

00:14:29,069 --> 00:14:35,309
front page itself so we developed some

00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:37,079
new editorial tools that the content

00:14:35,309 --> 00:14:39,660
editors on our team can use to more

00:14:37,079 --> 00:14:41,339
easily update not just the front page

00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:44,279
but landing page content throughout the

00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:47,189
site and give it a more highly designed

00:14:44,279 --> 00:14:49,529
visually appealing look and we've also

00:14:47,189 --> 00:14:53,220
just done some work with the home page

00:14:49,529 --> 00:14:57,240
to clean up the storytelling the

00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:59,399
information architecture and to kind of

00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:02,189
better promote key information about the

00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:03,899
project so obviously you've already seen

00:15:02,189 --> 00:15:06,689
this this new front page it went live

00:15:03,899 --> 00:15:09,389
just before drupalcon Dublin but just to

00:15:06,689 --> 00:15:11,149
give a couple of highlights we cleaned

00:15:09,389 --> 00:15:14,339
up the new section a little bit here

00:15:11,149 --> 00:15:17,670
we've adjusted how the homepage

00:15:14,339 --> 00:15:20,269
sponsorship works that is just displayed

00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:22,500
on the site and created something that

00:15:20,269 --> 00:15:24,720
fits better with the aesthetic and is

00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:27,030
better for kind of promoting related

00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:30,120
content

00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:31,440
and we've highlighted drupalcon in a

00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:34,320
more significant way on the homepage

00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,880
drupalcon being you know the most

00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:38,340
significant opportunity for a community

00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:39,750
to come together and work together it

00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:43,380
needed a better private place on the

00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:45,690
site so what this means besides just a

00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:48,840
better look and feel for drupal.org is

00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:51,900
it means more editorial flexibility so

00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:55,730
if you advance the next slide Megan we

00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:57,960
can much more easily create content and

00:15:55,730 --> 00:16:00,510
like I said a more designed a more

00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:04,310
highly produced format very quickly and

00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:06,780
that means that we can use different

00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:10,410
different ways to promote success

00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:13,230
stories about Drupal 8 that come from us

00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:15,300
partners to promote exciting new

00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:19,820
technology coming in point releases of

00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:22,770
Drupal and to promote kind of

00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:25,800
time-sensitive events in the life cycle

00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:27,570
of Drupal we can also use this to go

00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:29,340
beyond the home page and create better

00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:32,700
highly produced content elsewhere on the

00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:34,440
site so if you advance again Megan we

00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:36,420
actually first use these new tools to

00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:40,380
build the membership campaign that you

00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:41,970
may have seen live on drupal.org that

00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:44,400
features our community cultivation

00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:47,580
grants that are made possible by our

00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:50,730
members so it let us do some some new

00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:54,060
storytelling in a in a better way than

00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:55,620
we've been able to do before to drive

00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:59,100
membership to support community

00:16:55,620 --> 00:17:00,270
cultivation and to you know expand the

00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:04,350
camps that are happening around the

00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:05,970
world so that's one example of a new

00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:07,260
thing that we're able to produce using

00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:09,450
these editorial tools that we've created

00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:12,240
but we have other things coming up soon

00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:14,550
so megan is going to advance again and

00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:16,230
show a couple mocks these are non final

00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:21,030
mock-ups but if you go to the next slide

00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:24,810
this is uh the beginning of rough

00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:27,120
mocking up of beginning to talk about

00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:30,750
Drupal in specific industries talk about

00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:32,730
why Drupal is the tool that an evaluator

00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:35,490
needs to be the center of the digital

00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:39,180
experience for trying to create to talk

00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:40,440
about those key markets where drupal is

00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:43,470
the

00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:45,389
is the logical solution and how those

00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:46,769
solutions are built so not only can we

00:17:45,389 --> 00:17:49,230
build some more attractively designed

00:17:46,769 --> 00:17:52,580
landing pages we can if you advance

00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:55,860
again just go slowly through the next

00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:57,480
two or three slides we can start

00:17:55,860 --> 00:18:00,360
building solution pages that are around

00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:02,100
specific industry specific vertical

00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:03,960
markets like higher education or

00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:06,090
government and we can promote

00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:08,129
third-party technology and distributions

00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:11,460
we can promote events occurring at

00:18:08,129 --> 00:18:13,980
drupalcon like key summits and really

00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:16,230
start creating a conversation that's

00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:18,330
reflected both on drupal.org and on

00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:20,009
drupalcon about why Drupal is the

00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:21,360
powerful tool that it is and this is

00:18:20,009 --> 00:18:23,129
content that's been missing from

00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:26,960
drupal.org for years and years and years

00:18:23,129 --> 00:18:30,840
it's been so focused on a volunteer and

00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:33,360
and contributor the code contributor

00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:36,330
mindset that that we have really relied

00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:38,759
on service providers to generate this

00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:40,049
sort of content before but it's

00:18:38,759 --> 00:18:42,230
something that Drupal it's drupal.org

00:18:40,049 --> 00:18:44,190
itself it's a story that we need to tell

00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:46,529
and so of course we're going to be

00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:50,279
looking to partner with people who

00:18:46,529 --> 00:18:51,990
created these success stories and who

00:18:50,279 --> 00:18:53,340
create these kinds of technologies to

00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:54,960
help develop this content so that's

00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:56,879
something that's that we're working on

00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,529
now we've developed the tools tools for

00:18:56,879 --> 00:19:01,679
and it's it's coming soon we're quite

00:18:58,529 --> 00:19:08,850
excited about it so if you keep going

00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:10,409
again and again so in other news this

00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:12,059
last quarter of course was the lead-up

00:19:10,409 --> 00:19:13,980
to drupalcon Dublin and for the

00:19:12,059 --> 00:19:16,470
engineering team at the association in

00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:19,200
particular this means touching base with

00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:21,870
community contributors at sprints and

00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:24,980
taking a look at a lot of what's going

00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:28,200
on for the project in the community so

00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:32,700
their work or releases obviously 8.2

00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:34,610
least and we are going to start the

00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:37,019
cycle for the eight point three release

00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:38,610
there's some issue credits tweaks that

00:19:37,019 --> 00:19:41,549
we've done based on feedback from the

00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:44,399
community you know that system has been

00:19:41,549 --> 00:19:46,139
so important such a good incentive for

00:19:44,399 --> 00:19:47,820
organizations who are sponsoring

00:19:46,139 --> 00:19:50,250
contributors and we need to carefully

00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:52,200
protect that system so in addition to

00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:54,119
trying to find ways to reward reward

00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,370
more kinds of contributions we also want

00:19:54,119 --> 00:19:57,340
to make

00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:58,990
sure that it's it's carefully controlled

00:19:57,340 --> 00:20:01,540
it's providing good incentives and it's

00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:04,180
not a system that people can gain so

00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:08,770
we're being very careful with it and

00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:12,130
making changes is needed composer

00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:15,970
support was added to drupal.org actually

00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:17,710
not this not q3 but in q2 in a alpha

00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:20,050
state and then has been in beta

00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:21,700
throughout q3 it's something that's now

00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:23,590
widely used by a large number of

00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:26,500
organisations to manage their Drupal

00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:31,179
sites both Drupal 8 and drupal 7 it's

00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:33,160
the PHP workflow developer or answer

00:20:31,179 --> 00:20:35,830
workflow for managing PHP projects and

00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:39,760
we're really pleased that it's so stable

00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:42,940
and doing so well we're also working on

00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:44,530
our infrastructure we're virtualizing

00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:47,440
elements of our infrastructure to make

00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:50,350
it portable so that we can be flexible

00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:53,530
with in our data center at the

00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:55,390
open-source lab but also in cloud

00:20:53,530 --> 00:20:57,610
hosting environments and so that we can

00:20:55,390 --> 00:21:00,580
just be a little bit more flexible and

00:20:57,610 --> 00:21:02,380
agile with the with the infrastructure

00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:04,900
that we use to scaffold the project and

00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:07,330
then finally we've really been engaging

00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:08,800
with the community on a number of

00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:10,840
initiatives of their own and I'm going

00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:12,250
to add a fourth one in here so there's a

00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:14,320
few things that the community has been

00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:16,660
driving and we've been supporting that

00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:22,150
are very very exciting in different ways

00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:26,400
for one there's a highly produced Drupal

00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:28,770
8 user guide that has been closely

00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:31,120
curated with tight editorial control

00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:33,010
that Jennifer hodgdon has been largely

00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:35,740
working on to organize along with a

00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:38,770
number of other volunteers that is

00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:40,179
actually it's actually already deployed

00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:42,250
to droop about Oregon we're going to be

00:21:40,179 --> 00:21:43,690
begin linking it to other places but it

00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:45,400
is something that's written with an

00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:47,530
editorial standard of an industry public

00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:52,200
publication it's really powerful content

00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:55,000
and it uses a new kind of workflow that

00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:56,260
unrelated to our previous documentation

00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,270
so it's taking a little time to get it

00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:59,620
published but it's very very cool and

00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:02,410
it's going to be great information for

00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:05,170
evaluators and new users to Drupal to

00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:07,370
encourage them into how to get started

00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:10,220
with your blade there's all

00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:13,580
documentation migration and progress in

00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:17,630
really q1 and q2 we finished some new

00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:19,700
tools for documentation but of course

00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:21,440
there's over 12,000 pages of

00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:23,240
documentation on Drupal at work so the

00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:25,790
migration process is really critical and

00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:27,410
that's volunteer lead so we've been

00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:29,840
finding new people to maintain the

00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:32,660
documentation on drupal.org to clean it

00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:35,510
up documentation is now version so you

00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:37,490
don't find this mix of d 67 and DA

00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:38,570
documentation all on a single page and

00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:40,130
have to kind of tease out the

00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:43,910
distinctions yourself it's it's all

00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:46,670
properly separate separated by the major

00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:49,280
platform version and that's an ongoing

00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:50,720
process we also are supporting some

00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:52,429
changes that will make the project

00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:56,540
application process easier make it

00:22:52,429 --> 00:22:58,370
easier for new contributors to to

00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:59,990
contribute projects to contribute their

00:22:58,370 --> 00:23:02,870
integrations with their third party

00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:04,670
technology to drupal org it's a process

00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:07,040
that's been kind of a long running

00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:09,350
community pain point and there's a lot

00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:10,490
of moving pieces so it's it's moving a

00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:12,290
little slow but it's something that

00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:13,610
we've been working on with community

00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:15,470
members who are passionate about it and

00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:17,179
we thought we sprinted on a bit at

00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:21,679
Dublin and then the fourth item that

00:23:17,179 --> 00:23:22,790
I'll just throw in here that happened at

00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:24,980
Dublin and didn't make it onto the

00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:27,320
slides it's just that dreddit er is a

00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:29,300
tool that some of you may know of it's

00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:31,400
it's a browser extension that many of

00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:34,550
our developers use it's it's all been

00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:36,500
pretty critical to a coors workflow and

00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:38,570
features from that tool are now being

00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:40,610
ported directly into drupal.org by the

00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:42,650
maintainer of that of the derivative

00:23:40,610 --> 00:23:44,270
project and we're just supporting him

00:23:42,650 --> 00:23:47,690
and encouraging him and making sure that

00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:49,550
that happens in a way to help help keep

00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:51,920
the project moving while larger

00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:53,420
initiatives like the technical advisory

00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:58,070
committee tooling exploration are

00:23:53,420 --> 00:24:00,220
ongoing so yeah it's quite a lot very

00:23:58,070 --> 00:24:03,170
exciting stuff and more coming soon

00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:04,730
that's great well good work I mean it's

00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:08,330
amazing what your team is able to

00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:12,530
produce and as a guest out of the park

00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:14,179
as they say thank you all right well

00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:15,920
Rachel freezing wasn't able to join us

00:24:14,179 --> 00:24:18,890
today because she is in Baltimore

00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:20,280
getting drupalcon Baltimore ready and so

00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:22,170
I just wanted to

00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:26,430
share a few things about triple con

00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:28,620
dublin on her behalf so it was a

00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:31,500
fantastic event that just happened that

00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:35,910
had just shy of eighteen hundred people

00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:39,600
at the attended um you know this is a

00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:43,380
really great developer conference and um

00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:45,120
was our first time coming together after

00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:46,980
a drupal AIDS release there was really

00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:49,320
positive energy the business community

00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:50,670
was there in full force and jana

00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:54,180
cummings obey is going to talk a bit

00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:57,990
about that and some of the things

00:24:54,180 --> 00:25:00,530
they're seen in europe uh as it relates

00:24:57,990 --> 00:25:03,810
to drupal's growth and opportunities

00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:08,010
from a contribution standpoint we have a

00:25:03,810 --> 00:25:09,600
really strong sprint and lots of lots of

00:25:08,010 --> 00:25:11,730
newcomers that came in and learn how to

00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:14,880
sprint for the first time drew cons are

00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:16,680
just a great way to bring in those

00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:18,540
newcomers and mentor them and show them

00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:22,170
how to be kind of one of us and

00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:25,350
contributing so it's just uh just was a

00:25:22,170 --> 00:25:26,970
fantastic event has lots more details to

00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:31,260
come Rachel's going to be working on a

00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:33,240
blog post I shall share out and um we'll

00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:35,940
also make sure she has a chance to come

00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:38,820
and share some of those details with all

00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:40,260
of you as some as she's got them all

00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:43,940
compiled she just needs a little bit of

00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:46,290
time to close out that event um anyhow

00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:48,270
certainly great work by our local

00:25:46,290 --> 00:25:50,760
community in Ireland as well as all the

00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:53,970
volunteers that helped run the tracks

00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:56,640
and other special programming that make

00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:58,710
triple cons so special and magical being

00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:04,110
lots of great feedback on the content so

00:25:58,710 --> 00:26:08,370
big big props to our volunteers ok I am

00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:11,910
now going to stop sharing my screen and

00:26:08,370 --> 00:26:13,560
so Yanni I'd like to hand it over to you

00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:18,380
so you can tell us a little bit about

00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:21,410
your survey and some of your findings

00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:25,560
thanks Meagan hopefully all hear me well

00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:28,980
so yeah my name is Jana Gana leola on

00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:31,350
the CEO of X over and together with the

00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:32,809
mission one whale there that is on

00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:34,610
holiday in

00:26:32,809 --> 00:26:38,120
silence with the backpack connectivity

00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:41,919
it could enjoy the call we had Drupal

00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:45,169
CEO survey for the first time so we

00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:47,720
approached the CEOs of Drupal companies

00:26:45,169 --> 00:26:49,669
around the globe the focus was in Europe

00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:53,360
because this was for the European

00:26:49,669 --> 00:26:56,330
drupalcon but we've got so much answers

00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:58,789
from date from via other other

00:26:56,330 --> 00:27:03,789
continents too so we we ended up having

00:26:58,789 --> 00:27:06,649
a having a global global service oh

00:27:03,789 --> 00:27:09,679
really quickly the I have like 10

00:27:06,649 --> 00:27:11,059
minutes timid agenda here so let's go

00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:13,580
through the background and manage

00:27:11,059 --> 00:27:16,519
findings something about the companies

00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:18,830
and their projects and then there's more

00:27:16,519 --> 00:27:21,529
background information comments that I

00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:24,799
won't go through but i'll share link in

00:27:21,529 --> 00:27:29,299
the hidden chat and then Mandela shared

00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:31,759
with the people people are seeing the CD

00:27:29,299 --> 00:27:33,590
recording so you can go through the rest

00:27:31,759 --> 00:27:35,360
of the slides so there's like half of

00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:40,820
the presentation I don't go through now

00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:44,240
because a big boring so mr. was open on

00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:47,119
over September 2016 we got actually no

00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:50,809
it's like 82 responses but we have

00:27:47,119 --> 00:27:53,090
another 75 first one of those and the

00:27:50,809 --> 00:27:56,720
response is there from 35 different

00:27:53,090 --> 00:28:00,710
countries the focus was mostly in Europe

00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:03,409
so say like 20 25 European countries out

00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:07,960
of 45 50 but we have here in the old

00:28:03,409 --> 00:28:13,279
continent and then us india australia

00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:15,289
new zealand japan quite a quite a mixed

00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:19,509
bunch you know in a good sense that the

00:28:15,289 --> 00:28:22,100
the coverage was good the major findings

00:28:19,509 --> 00:28:24,889
will be found where that the triple

00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:27,619
companies are growing that all the focus

00:28:24,889 --> 00:28:32,600
areas of the companies are in growth

00:28:27,619 --> 00:28:35,480
I'll go in the deeper a bit on that the

00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:37,249
future is bright everybody is believing

00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:40,730
that yes this is the thing that they

00:28:37,249 --> 00:28:42,740
want to do with the future too but it

00:28:40,730 --> 00:28:44,360
must be said that the the triple-eight

00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:46,580
eruption has been slower than expected

00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:50,390
and there are some racist

00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:52,730
I get get that in later and then it was

00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:56,059
also a bit sue present for us to find

00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:57,559
out the Drupal is widely widely used to

00:28:56,059 --> 00:29:00,260
go with other open source solution

00:28:57,559 --> 00:29:03,649
especially noches react and angular a

00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:09,110
lot of JavaScript stuff talk about

00:29:03,649 --> 00:29:12,529
companies the amount of services that

00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:14,809
the companies provide the focus area

00:29:12,529 --> 00:29:17,600
most of the companies well of course

00:29:14,809 --> 00:29:22,600
doing web development use Express visual

00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:26,149
design support and then there is latter

00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:29,450
lot of other all the old what we what we

00:29:26,149 --> 00:29:31,669
asked for all the other advertising

00:29:29,450 --> 00:29:36,049
called the press knows so forth got

00:29:31,669 --> 00:29:38,149
number of number of mentions but they

00:29:36,049 --> 00:29:41,330
are to take away from this slide is that

00:29:38,149 --> 00:29:44,960
the the potential for the growth and

00:29:41,330 --> 00:29:47,539
maybe putting going to some leashes is

00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:49,820
not in support usage be a visual

00:29:47,539 --> 00:29:54,230
development because we all are do with

00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:57,220
that so then I on the marketing mobile

00:29:54,230 --> 00:30:00,019
development services on social media

00:29:57,220 --> 00:30:03,049
something that fits your fits your

00:30:00,019 --> 00:30:04,820
company I'm not the expert said with you

00:30:03,049 --> 00:30:08,649
should go because they never go there

00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:13,510
they like to do it all over again so

00:30:08,649 --> 00:30:18,789
think about diversifying the portfolio

00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:22,190
on the industry served there is the

00:30:18,789 --> 00:30:26,779
charities and nonprofit going public

00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:28,669
health care and media are those ones

00:30:26,779 --> 00:30:33,289
that the most of the companies have

00:30:28,669 --> 00:30:36,200
clients the Europe was really strong in

00:30:33,289 --> 00:30:38,990
banking and insurance and the rest of

00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:41,269
the world was not so for the people

00:30:38,990 --> 00:30:43,940
having companies outside Europe maybe

00:30:41,269 --> 00:30:47,659
that's an industry that you should

00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:51,230
should look at there would be a lot of

00:30:47,659 --> 00:30:53,149
European European case studies of using

00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:55,480
Drupal at those industries and for the

00:30:53,149 --> 00:30:57,340
Europeans then the travel and tourism

00:30:55,480 --> 00:31:00,400
sector is

00:30:57,340 --> 00:31:05,400
understood by us compared to the global

00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:11,320
counterparts and then there is number of

00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:14,010
traditional industries like clothing and

00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:20,910
fashion construction consultancy

00:31:14,010 --> 00:31:26,770
electrics energy sports telecom

00:31:20,910 --> 00:31:31,450
logistics automotive so forth that mark

00:31:26,770 --> 00:31:34,300
white little so authored by the small

00:31:31,450 --> 00:31:38,050
amount of Drupal company so that might

00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:40,360
be a good good area to grow into if you

00:31:38,050 --> 00:31:44,800
have not tidy on it I have a question

00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:48,220
that's coming in from the Q&A section C

00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:50,080
Rooney asks I don't understand why you

00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:52,150
suggest quote no potential for big

00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:53,830
growth and supporting web dev is it just

00:31:52,150 --> 00:31:55,450
because you think it's saturated by all

00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:58,840
other agencies doing it what if they

00:31:55,450 --> 00:32:01,930
entire pie is growing for everyone yeah

00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:05,130
but the other the IT pie that's a good

00:32:01,930 --> 00:32:08,530
question the IT pie did the sort of

00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:11,620
social development or or web services

00:32:08,530 --> 00:32:15,460
price growing if you go back to this

00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:17,470
line so dear if you grow here then I

00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:21,430
would say that they are if you can

00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:22,930
sustain your growth on airs other areas

00:32:21,430 --> 00:32:27,720
to you on the same page that you would

00:32:22,930 --> 00:32:30,760
do a web development ah you probably

00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:32,830
could actually grow fast later in the

00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:36,970
web developed area because the others

00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:39,430
especially advertising marketing service

00:32:36,970 --> 00:32:43,870
design social media marketing /

00:32:39,430 --> 00:32:46,210
consulting they all feed in the web

00:32:43,870 --> 00:32:48,160
development that happens of visual

00:32:46,210 --> 00:32:51,490
design or user experience and then

00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:55,570
support falls so the certain parts that

00:32:51,490 --> 00:32:58,450
we are at the end of the sort of a mmm

00:32:55,570 --> 00:33:00,250
value chain so those are at the end and

00:32:58,450 --> 00:33:03,280
there's lot of things that would happen

00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:05,620
before that so I would go there not just

00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:07,720
because there is less competition a

00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:11,690
Drupal world there that that's one thing

00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:14,960
and that the other one is that these

00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:17,419
services feed web development and the

00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:20,600
others that we are strong already so we

00:33:17,419 --> 00:33:28,580
should go upstream into value chain if

00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:31,100
that makes sense then for the looking

00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:32,870
inside the company what are the top

00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:35,509
priorities for the next three years the

00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:36,740
US as mentioned the people the companies

00:33:35,509 --> 00:33:40,159
have been growing so we have also

00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:42,740
numbers how how the company have grown

00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:46,250
in headcount but I don't got them true

00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:49,759
here but the trend is that a yes we all

00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:51,259
are growing and the focus areas for the

00:33:49,759 --> 00:33:53,950
for the management is developing new

00:33:51,259 --> 00:33:58,610
growth ensuring financial growth and

00:33:53,950 --> 00:34:02,210
finding the right talent and then if we

00:33:58,610 --> 00:34:06,940
look at the major challenges this exact

00:34:02,210 --> 00:34:11,839
the same same same same topics here the

00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:16,270
talent retention is higher compared to

00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:18,589
the into the focus area so the we

00:34:16,270 --> 00:34:22,220
struggle with the finding the right

00:34:18,589 --> 00:34:24,889
talent especially in Europe and then we

00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:28,129
have issues with written reat ending

00:34:24,889 --> 00:34:33,139
that talent but it's not a top priority

00:34:28,129 --> 00:34:36,470
for us and that's something that most of

00:34:33,139 --> 00:34:39,409
the companies are now growing in the

00:34:36,470 --> 00:34:41,690
size that we are companies of 50 people

00:34:39,409 --> 00:34:45,859
100 people to other people for other

00:34:41,690 --> 00:34:47,960
people and then we are more like any

00:34:45,859 --> 00:34:52,909
other company that they did open so

00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:55,520
spirit most probably is is not that

00:34:52,909 --> 00:34:57,200
strong anymore with all the people that

00:34:55,520 --> 00:35:00,140
come into company that they just come

00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:04,540
amid such company bit society company so

00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:04,540
they are the the community stuff

00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:08,850
is not the only way to do talent

00:35:07,170 --> 00:35:10,140
retention that the sort of have been

00:35:08,850 --> 00:35:12,600
with the with the companies that I've

00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:14,670
been discussing it at the Iowa we let

00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:16,860
the people go to Drupal core we let them

00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:19,320
to contribute and so forth but there

00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:20,850
will be more and more people that don't

00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:23,040
really care about those things where

00:35:20,850 --> 00:35:26,580
your company grows so you need to focus

00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:28,470
on great place to work service or

00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:31,680
something that you can actually measure

00:35:28,470 --> 00:35:34,430
your success with being a good employer

00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:41,130
and keeping the talent retention in

00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:44,130
control talk about projects the this is

00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:50,130
the this the slide that makes me makes

00:35:44,130 --> 00:35:52,350
me sad the typical projects for the for

00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:56,220
the trooper Drupal sites there was

00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:59,000
number of companies that the producer

00:35:56,220 --> 00:36:01,980
marketing so it lasts less than 10k and

00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:05,170
my guests almost half of the companies

00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:08,170
produce is less than 30k

00:36:05,170 --> 00:36:09,670
and if you talk about in depresses and

00:36:08,170 --> 00:36:12,010
there are some companies that do you

00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:14,440
live in 10 K the pressure washers it

00:36:12,010 --> 00:36:15,640
might be that some people have looked

00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:20,130
really understood what what the

00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:23,230
enterprise means or then they exhaust

00:36:20,130 --> 00:36:25,750
underpriced themselves very very very

00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:28,839
happily and then if you look at the

00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:31,270
other end then at this like half a

00:36:28,839 --> 00:36:34,240
million 1 billion euro or lower case

00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:35,890
this was not this didn't happen if i

00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:40,270
remember correctly didn't have the

00:36:35,890 --> 00:36:43,599
currents so it's pounds or USD or euros

00:36:40,270 --> 00:36:46,839
you do any of those those cholesterol or

00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:49,540
most of the car anyhow these are still

00:36:46,839 --> 00:36:51,099
very inexpensive and brussels we have

00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:52,780
been in a discussion with au in the

00:36:51,099 --> 00:36:55,480
press clients that they say that the

00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:57,670
iffy iffy if it changed ASAP we don't

00:36:55,480 --> 00:37:00,720
implement the city what if you changed

00:36:57,670 --> 00:37:04,150
SI p it will cost us one minute new euro

00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:06,970
roughly so we don't change SI p but we

00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:09,339
do something else around it so those are

00:37:06,970 --> 00:37:12,910
the boxes people are people are used i

00:37:09,339 --> 00:37:15,460
heard from really reliable source i

00:37:12,910 --> 00:37:18,010
heard that there there's been cases that

00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:22,619
that de sanctions the enterprise

00:37:18,010 --> 00:37:25,540
deployment have been like 10 million so

00:37:22,619 --> 00:37:28,660
we

00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:33,850
price ourselves really low that might be

00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:35,710
because the we are not known in the code

00:37:33,850 --> 00:37:37,780
in there in the enterprise world we are

00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:41,590
we are unsure about ourselves whether we

00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:47,020
are worth of it or that the Drupal has

00:37:41,590 --> 00:37:51,330
in your market has a still sort of open

00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:53,740
source hope list it needs instead of a

00:37:51,330 --> 00:37:55,840
truly and approach solution that that

00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:58,960
calm that is comparable with Adobe aside

00:37:55,840 --> 00:38:02,260
core the current leaders in the process

00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:08,380
I just ask a quick question yarn actual

00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:11,370
but the you know when you talk about how

00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:14,770
we have we're kind of underpricing are

00:38:11,370 --> 00:38:16,810
our services when you break this out

00:38:14,770 --> 00:38:20,470
regionally do you see a difference like

00:38:16,810 --> 00:38:23,890
for example I know you know there's near

00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:25,870
we call it near shore and for type of

00:38:23,890 --> 00:38:27,940
services I'm just wondering if they are

00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:30,580
you know if you broke them out if they

00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:33,280
happen to have lower price points and

00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:37,840
say what the agency and Europe or the

00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:40,900
u.s. might have we didn't break it out I

00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:43,030
would think that the UH if you do if you

00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:45,820
do nearshoring there or go to Europe for

00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:47,920
example in in Europe or South America

00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:51,130
from North America the prices will be

00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:54,340
like half or one-third of the of the

00:38:51,130 --> 00:38:58,240
prices of the of the more expensive

00:38:54,340 --> 00:39:01,780
countries so it still doesn't change the

00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:04,720
picture that the that the interpreter

00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:08,170
also with less than 10k 30k or 15 games

00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:09,880
and that's really cheap still so the I

00:39:08,170 --> 00:39:14,530
don't have the data here so I don't want

00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:17,380
to want to guess too much but they are

00:39:14,530 --> 00:39:21,580
still they still even if that would be

00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:23,530
taken into account the prices are are

00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:26,670
very low but I would say that the dose

00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:30,490
those companies on the on the left are

00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:34,530
typically small companies for people or

00:39:30,490 --> 00:39:37,420
something like that and then probably

00:39:34,530 --> 00:39:39,579
more those areas that we did with the

00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:43,779
development this is cheaper

00:39:39,579 --> 00:39:46,900
but still even then they could get more

00:39:43,779 --> 00:39:51,839
money out of the work if things would be

00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:58,619
done done properly that comes to did

00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:58,619
last last slide that there

00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:05,780
my admissions advice is that the that

00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:09,980
the Drupal is so great system and so

00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:13,600
great platform and it's it's in several

00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:16,340
senses it's comparable to the to the

00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:20,960
enterprise CMS and the price and the

00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:23,930
price platforms so we need to all of the

00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:26,320
companies need to figure out what what

00:40:23,930 --> 00:40:29,540
are the sweet spot where where the goal

00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:31,610
specialized somewhat pick the right

00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:36,850
battles and access the pricing while you

00:40:31,610 --> 00:40:39,800
go if you want to grow you need cash and

00:40:36,850 --> 00:40:41,510
for getting more cash out of your work

00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:43,370
you need to raise your prices but you

00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:47,480
can't raise your prices if you if the

00:40:43,370 --> 00:40:48,650
value is not visible to your clients so

00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:51,400
that's why you need to develop the

00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:53,900
markets you need to grow the demand and

00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:56,090
you need to contribute the group of

00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:58,130
suckers also outside coding so it's not

00:40:56,090 --> 00:41:00,590
sauce that contributing contributing

00:40:58,130 --> 00:41:02,270
code back is this the what was already

00:41:00,590 --> 00:41:07,340
discussed is this core that that's that

00:41:02,270 --> 00:41:09,620
that's really cool thing but i would say

00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:13,430
that contributing marketing contributing

00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:16,180
ux contributing a case studies would

00:41:13,430 --> 00:41:20,390
have bigger impact because Drupal 8 is

00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:23,420
mostly ready usable and so forth but we

00:41:20,390 --> 00:41:28,040
just need to make it make it the oxygen

00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:33,050
big time if you have in your company you

00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:35,450
have a user experience people I try to

00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:38,390
get them to contribute back to the air

00:41:35,450 --> 00:41:43,370
back to the community I know that they

00:41:38,390 --> 00:41:46,400
are the Drupal discuss a way of doing

00:41:43,370 --> 00:41:49,550
things might not be the easiest for for

00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:51,620
the you UX designers because they are

00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:55,490
not used to that kind of back and forth

00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:57,170
discuss about a day a day and then with

00:41:55,490 --> 00:41:58,850
the design you can you can have endless

00:41:57,170 --> 00:42:01,010
discussions with what is good and what's

00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:02,330
not and whether somebody just could

00:42:01,010 --> 00:42:05,210
implement it and soulful without

00:42:02,330 --> 00:42:08,900
deciding so all of that aside I need to

00:42:05,210 --> 00:42:12,380
brace them them somewhat that day that

00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:15,289
they can they can sustain the did

00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:17,779
technical oriented community but we need

00:42:15,289 --> 00:42:21,259
to do something on that front the true

00:42:17,779 --> 00:42:23,900
power is in a really good position

00:42:21,259 --> 00:42:26,240
compared to adobe site core and the

00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:29,569
other enterprise systems if we get the

00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:30,950
US right and it's not right now so we

00:42:29,569 --> 00:42:33,079
need to do something about it it's

00:42:30,950 --> 00:42:37,000
getting better three sort of cool stuff

00:42:33,079 --> 00:42:39,440
on the m23's note on a tube and I

00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,880
actually discuss with one of the one of

00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:42,890
the use of clear skies that that were

00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:45,589
part of that that process so it can be

00:42:42,890 --> 00:42:49,460
done but it's something that should be

00:42:45,589 --> 00:42:51,619
done and it should be done with the more

00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:54,319
rigorous approach that now so if you

00:42:51,619 --> 00:42:55,940
have a huge resources then go to talk to

00:42:54,319 --> 00:42:58,309
them whether they were pretty interested

00:42:55,940 --> 00:43:02,109
in contributing back with the user

00:42:58,309 --> 00:43:04,849
experience and then last but not least

00:43:02,109 --> 00:43:07,339
definitely not least is that we need to

00:43:04,849 --> 00:43:09,349
focus on sales by disqus with number of

00:43:07,339 --> 00:43:12,349
people in the intruder con tablet and

00:43:09,349 --> 00:43:14,569
their sales strategy was but it was

00:43:12,349 --> 00:43:17,240
exercised red is like few years ago that

00:43:14,569 --> 00:43:20,240
you a Brazil wait for rings then you

00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:22,519
answer the phone and then you sell

00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:24,559
something with the custom ones that is

00:43:22,519 --> 00:43:26,619
not enough anymore when you wear your

00:43:24,559 --> 00:43:29,269
company speaker you need to do something

00:43:26,619 --> 00:43:31,400
you need to have active sales you need

00:43:29,269 --> 00:43:37,430
to grow the marketing of the market and

00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:40,759
then get more customers better clients

00:43:37,430 --> 00:43:42,289
with deeper pockets and hopefully also

00:43:40,759 --> 00:43:43,789
that got a project that you could

00:43:42,289 --> 00:43:45,980
contribute that something back to the

00:43:43,789 --> 00:43:48,980
community but there is a huge amount of

00:43:45,980 --> 00:43:51,740
money available right now and I would

00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:54,079
say that it belongs to us because we are

00:43:51,740 --> 00:43:56,210
the good side of things we are working

00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:59,900
with the open source that has all the

00:43:56,210 --> 00:44:02,089
benefits for the clients so they are we

00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:05,990
just need to need to get get our things

00:44:02,089 --> 00:44:08,779
together sell more and the world is a

00:44:05,990 --> 00:44:12,349
bit greater place to work that's all

00:44:08,779 --> 00:44:14,690
about God thanks that's great yani thank

00:44:12,349 --> 00:44:17,000
you so much for doing the the research

00:44:14,690 --> 00:44:19,099
and pushing the survey yeah really glad

00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:21,650
we could partner on this and I certainly

00:44:19,099 --> 00:44:23,299
hope we can do it again and work with

00:44:21,650 --> 00:44:25,329
other supporters to find out what kind

00:44:23,299 --> 00:44:29,950
of information they're looking for and

00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:31,989
and keep this going year after year yeah

00:44:29,950 --> 00:44:34,599
that does the plan and then I just put

00:44:31,989 --> 00:44:37,029
on the chat the link to the link to the

00:44:34,599 --> 00:44:40,809
slides that has to see your comments go

00:44:37,029 --> 00:44:42,819
read them they are quite quite some of

00:44:40,809 --> 00:44:45,700
them are eye-opening so you don't really

00:44:42,819 --> 00:44:47,499
understand or disagree but the we talk

00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:48,640
about those in your organization and

00:44:47,499 --> 00:44:51,690
there's also background information

00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:54,940
about countries and so forth so they are

00:44:51,690 --> 00:44:56,019
enjoy enjoy yourselves that's great and

00:44:54,940 --> 00:44:57,759
I'll make sure to share all that

00:44:56,019 --> 00:45:00,130
information out when we share the

00:44:57,759 --> 00:45:02,019
recording with all the supporters um

00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:05,259
yeah I just want to say thanks for being

00:45:02,019 --> 00:45:08,319
such a great partner um except the XO

00:45:05,259 --> 00:45:10,420
they really kind of walks the talk so

00:45:08,319 --> 00:45:12,160
when yonni says you know it's it's about

00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:13,719
contributing back and all the different

00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:16,150
ways to do that and why that's important

00:45:13,719 --> 00:45:17,709
for your business except XO he's been

00:45:16,150 --> 00:45:19,930
doing that quite a bit on many fronts

00:45:17,709 --> 00:45:21,910
and I can always kind of yo Nate when we

00:45:19,930 --> 00:45:24,579
need that extra support so just my big

00:45:21,910 --> 00:45:27,759
thank you to you yawning excess free

00:45:24,579 --> 00:45:30,759
nice to hear ya alright well that

00:45:27,759 --> 00:45:33,640
concludes our quarterly update for our

00:45:30,759 --> 00:45:36,519
supporters and Megan I have a couple

00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:40,299
questions oh right horse harness yeah

00:45:36,519 --> 00:45:45,190
let me go through and just so just one

00:45:40,299 --> 00:45:46,539
follow-up first earlier see Rooney had

00:45:45,190 --> 00:45:48,430
asked why do you suggest no potential

00:45:46,539 --> 00:45:50,319
big growth and you'd summarize that the

00:45:48,430 --> 00:45:53,499
growth of larger pie as possible but

00:45:50,319 --> 00:45:54,969
focusing on by but by focusing on some

00:45:53,499 --> 00:45:56,410
of the underserved markets upstream

00:45:54,969 --> 00:45:59,529
that'll feed the growth of that

00:45:56,410 --> 00:46:01,569
traditional web development market he

00:45:59,529 --> 00:46:03,099
agreed with that and just also said that

00:46:01,569 --> 00:46:04,930
he'd also argue that there are also non

00:46:03,099 --> 00:46:07,089
Drupal agencies that are in those

00:46:04,930 --> 00:46:08,890
upstream services that might be trying

00:46:07,089 --> 00:46:10,449
to get downstream into Drupal and web

00:46:08,890 --> 00:46:11,829
development was just an insight that i

00:46:10,449 --> 00:46:12,999
thought i would share back the rest of

00:46:11,829 --> 00:46:15,160
the people listening on the call yeah

00:46:12,999 --> 00:46:16,749
that's that's happening I what I said

00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:19,150
that there are there's more interested

00:46:16,749 --> 00:46:21,789
in in Drupal in the ad agencies and so

00:46:19,150 --> 00:46:24,400
forth so they keep your eyes open wanna

00:46:21,789 --> 00:46:26,440
do business yeah and there's hope I can

00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:28,779
just say one thing as these non Drupal

00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:31,479
agencies are looking to Drupal does that

00:46:28,779 --> 00:46:34,690
drive more partnership opportunities and

00:46:31,479 --> 00:46:36,819
mergers and acquisitions uh I mean

00:46:34,690 --> 00:46:38,259
series other comment there specifically

00:46:36,819 --> 00:46:39,340
was this is part of what drives the

00:46:38,259 --> 00:46:41,640
consolidation tran

00:46:39,340 --> 00:46:47,080
so certainly that seems to be I think

00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:50,320
part of that conversation ok Eric

00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:53,020
Robbins also asks specifically about

00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:55,000
drupalcon Baltimore quote we're

00:46:53,020 --> 00:46:56,620
budgeting for 2017 conferences and

00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:58,660
wondered in particular bad add-ons like

00:46:56,620 --> 00:46:59,950
summits and trainings is the pricing

00:46:58,660 --> 00:47:01,510
going to be roughly the same as last

00:46:59,950 --> 00:47:03,040
year are there new summits on the

00:47:01,510 --> 00:47:05,050
horizon the government summit was a

00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:06,360
great addition last year not sure if

00:47:05,050 --> 00:47:09,430
there's anything else you're looking at

00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:11,530
yeah I can definitely speak to that in

00:47:09,430 --> 00:47:13,060
terms of pricing well first of all I'm

00:47:11,530 --> 00:47:16,320
glad you want to go thanks for putting

00:47:13,060 --> 00:47:19,020
your budget so so early in the year um

00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:23,170
where you're always mindful of the

00:47:19,020 --> 00:47:25,030
pricing if there are any changes will be

00:47:23,170 --> 00:47:26,710
draconian it won't be like a typical

00:47:25,030 --> 00:47:29,880
conference that suddenly a thousand

00:47:26,710 --> 00:47:32,320
dollars um but because we do know that

00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:34,030
especially agencies just taking your

00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:38,260
team off the bench to go to a conference

00:47:34,030 --> 00:47:40,270
cost your company money so i'll have

00:47:38,260 --> 00:47:44,320
more news will be launching ticket sales

00:47:40,270 --> 00:47:46,030
in december of but you can generally

00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:47,500
base it off of last year's numbers there

00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:52,510
there might be an increase in a few

00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:54,700
areas possibly in the summit's and so in

00:47:52,510 --> 00:47:58,090
terms of content we're working on that

00:47:54,700 --> 00:48:00,970
content now we're gathering the track

00:47:58,090 --> 00:48:03,640
chairs and having those discussions um

00:48:00,970 --> 00:48:05,680
Amanda guns are my you know shoot me

00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:07,510
after this verse for talking about

00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:10,240
things that aren't totally fully

00:48:07,510 --> 00:48:12,940
cemented yet but we are looking at some

00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:14,800
content changes I think we have the

00:48:12,940 --> 00:48:16,840
right track so we always have the coding

00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:19,300
track and the project manager track and

00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:20,410
the business track and you know lots of

00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:22,390
things are the same there's some things

00:48:20,410 --> 00:48:23,950
that we want to do we want to have some

00:48:22,390 --> 00:48:26,230
stronger case studies so triple Eight's

00:48:23,950 --> 00:48:29,200
been out for a year so we're really

00:48:26,230 --> 00:48:32,050
looking for a strong case study track

00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:33,940
that we can really amplify some amazing

00:48:32,050 --> 00:48:35,860
stories and get the end users to come

00:48:33,940 --> 00:48:38,470
out and talking with her with their

00:48:35,860 --> 00:48:44,050
service provider about how drupal's

00:48:38,470 --> 00:48:45,640
transform their business and we we

00:48:44,050 --> 00:48:47,380
wondered that for two reasons one like

00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:49,480
we just want everyone to understand that

00:48:47,380 --> 00:48:50,990
this is happening that Drupal 8 is being

00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:55,010
adopted in a big way

00:48:50,990 --> 00:48:56,930
and it cannot be great sales tools for

00:48:55,010 --> 00:49:00,830
all of you to go back and reference

00:48:56,930 --> 00:49:02,660
these accounts and learn from them the

00:49:00,830 --> 00:49:05,330
the second thing we want to do is expose

00:49:02,660 --> 00:49:07,820
these case studies and let end-users

00:49:05,330 --> 00:49:09,230
know out there this is great content for

00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:11,810
you you should come and hear what your

00:49:09,230 --> 00:49:14,119
peers are doing I did a lot of research

00:49:11,810 --> 00:49:16,520
this summer talking to many many many

00:49:14,119 --> 00:49:19,700
customers asking like what would it take

00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:21,680
to get you to come to drupalcon and when

00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:23,060
I say customers and puck about CEOs and

00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:24,440
the director of engineering how do we

00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:26,869
get more of them to come for triple

00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:28,430
Collins said they want to hear about how

00:49:26,869 --> 00:49:30,680
I can push the envelope with Drupal and

00:49:28,430 --> 00:49:33,680
have a bigger impact for my business and

00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:36,080
I want to meet my peers I just don't

00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:38,600
have time for a lot of networking and so

00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:41,510
we are definitely trying to make sure we

00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:43,100
do our outreach to these kinds of this

00:49:41,510 --> 00:49:44,900
audience we let them know we have the

00:49:43,100 --> 00:49:46,010
content you're looking for and we're

00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:48,110
even looking to do some peer-to-peer

00:49:46,010 --> 00:49:51,560
networking opportunities for that

00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:54,230
audience and so that's that's one thing

00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:56,300
that we're doing some other things that

00:49:54,230 --> 00:50:00,740
we're doing is for the business

00:49:56,300 --> 00:50:02,660
community um well we have the business

00:50:00,740 --> 00:50:05,900
summit every year and it's great for

00:50:02,660 --> 00:50:08,930
that small medium sized business that's

00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:11,840
generally new like maybe i'd say like in

00:50:08,930 --> 00:50:14,480
the earlier stages of forming as a

00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:17,210
business they get into a room with

00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:18,770
masters in drupal business so someone

00:50:17,210 --> 00:50:21,260
like Jana is in there you might have

00:50:18,770 --> 00:50:24,890
Jeff wall pulled from phase two and they

00:50:21,260 --> 00:50:26,810
help facilitate discussions to you know

00:50:24,890 --> 00:50:28,850
help you as a business get stronger and

00:50:26,810 --> 00:50:30,710
so will continue to have that we want to

00:50:28,850 --> 00:50:32,990
start creating what I call the escalator

00:50:30,710 --> 00:50:35,600
to a business mastery and we need to

00:50:32,990 --> 00:50:37,220
start having to programs that sort of

00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:38,990
different kinds of the businesses in our

00:50:37,220 --> 00:50:42,950
community whether its maturity or size

00:50:38,990 --> 00:50:46,040
and so we are looking at another kind of

00:50:42,950 --> 00:50:47,630
summit a kind of program that quite sure

00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:49,490
exactly what it look like but something

00:50:47,630 --> 00:50:51,890
for those that are a little bit more

00:50:49,490 --> 00:50:53,540
mature have been around a little bit

00:50:51,890 --> 00:50:55,130
longer a need or maybe they're different

00:50:53,540 --> 00:50:57,859
sizes they need to have a different kind

00:50:55,130 --> 00:51:00,080
of discussion and so we're looking into

00:50:57,859 --> 00:51:04,460
into something for that niche on the

00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:05,410
business side of course businesses are

00:51:04,460 --> 00:51:10,390
always looking just

00:51:05,410 --> 00:51:11,920
sir and get in front of their audience

00:51:10,390 --> 00:51:14,290
or just to give back to the community

00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:15,940
through the sponsorship so we're looking

00:51:14,290 --> 00:51:19,330
at different kinds of sponsor packages

00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:20,350
and we're always open to new ideas so

00:51:19,330 --> 00:51:23,380
that's one thing we can always talk

00:51:20,350 --> 00:51:25,030
about and as for summits yes we are

00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:26,320
definitely doing the summits I think

00:51:25,030 --> 00:51:28,300
it's one thing that we're really strong

00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:29,500
at and you know I because the credit to

00:51:28,300 --> 00:51:32,080
the community because they created

00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:35,530
summits and then we've adopted that as

00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:37,660
part of the drupalcon programming so we

00:51:35,530 --> 00:51:41,590
will have higher at again it has sold

00:51:37,660 --> 00:51:44,230
out every year like within a week so we

00:51:41,590 --> 00:51:46,510
are looking to expand that so we can get

00:51:44,230 --> 00:51:48,160
more people in we're looking to even

00:51:46,510 --> 00:51:50,620
strengthen some of the content and the

00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:53,020
summit so that it's not just roundtable

00:51:50,620 --> 00:51:55,270
discussions amongst peers but also more

00:51:53,020 --> 00:51:59,020
key studies so we can learn from each

00:51:55,270 --> 00:52:00,670
other so we'll be doing that we will be

00:51:59,020 --> 00:52:03,340
bringing government back I mean we will

00:52:00,670 --> 00:52:06,760
be kind of the door steps more steps of

00:52:03,340 --> 00:52:08,050
federal government and wouldn't you know

00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:09,700
it just makes sense to have a government

00:52:08,050 --> 00:52:12,070
summit that was really popular so we

00:52:09,700 --> 00:52:13,510
want to bring that back the media summit

00:52:12,070 --> 00:52:15,100
was really strong last year was the

00:52:13,510 --> 00:52:17,320
first time we had that and so we're

00:52:15,100 --> 00:52:19,390
looking to bring that back again and

00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:23,050
we're looking into a few other new ones

00:52:19,390 --> 00:52:25,840
um one that we're exploring is nonprofit

00:52:23,050 --> 00:52:28,600
it's it's obviously a strong base within

00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:31,060
a Drupal it would make a lot of sense

00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:34,300
there's tons of associations in the

00:52:31,060 --> 00:52:37,510
greater DC area so they would easily be

00:52:34,300 --> 00:52:40,780
able to make it to Baltimore assuming

00:52:37,510 --> 00:52:42,490
they can you know get off work and the

00:52:40,780 --> 00:52:44,530
other thing is that being on the East

00:52:42,490 --> 00:52:49,240
Coast puts us in what we call the pharma

00:52:44,530 --> 00:52:51,340
belt the farm belt pH a RM and that's

00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:54,730
all the pharmaceutical medical devices

00:52:51,340 --> 00:52:58,180
healthcare that ranges from basically

00:52:54,730 --> 00:53:01,800
New York City down to DC you know so you

00:52:58,180 --> 00:53:06,760
have your Johnson & Johnson's and gosh

00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:08,200
you know Pfizer and AstraZeneca I think

00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:09,910
they're still there's been so many

00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:11,350
mergers I used to be in this sector so I

00:53:09,910 --> 00:53:13,840
used to be able to rattle these off so

00:53:11,350 --> 00:53:16,030
much faster anyhow we are thinking of

00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:17,830
having a track for that for that part of

00:53:16,030 --> 00:53:18,789
the industry too so we're just kind of

00:53:17,830 --> 00:53:19,869
exploring what

00:53:18,789 --> 00:53:22,650
would make the most sense in the

00:53:19,869 --> 00:53:25,599
capacity and in the space that we have

00:53:22,650 --> 00:53:26,859
you know I think Jana brought up a good

00:53:25,599 --> 00:53:28,900
point that maybe we're missing

00:53:26,859 --> 00:53:32,799
opportunities in banking um maybe

00:53:28,900 --> 00:53:34,660
there's not enough mmm there's not

00:53:32,799 --> 00:53:36,249
enough energy there yet to have a

00:53:34,660 --> 00:53:38,259
somewhat around banking but it certainly

00:53:36,249 --> 00:53:42,279
brings up something for me to consider

00:53:38,259 --> 00:53:45,009
in the future I do know that juries just

00:53:42,279 --> 00:53:47,489
announced a really big Drupal 8 win with

00:53:45,009 --> 00:53:50,679
Nasdaq so there are things happening

00:53:47,489 --> 00:53:53,949
there and you know in the US on the east

00:53:50,679 --> 00:53:56,140
coast around finance and so does

00:53:53,949 --> 00:53:57,519
something for me to consider so

00:53:56,140 --> 00:53:59,979
hopefully that answers your questions

00:53:57,519 --> 00:54:01,419
about Baltimore but thanks again for

00:53:59,979 --> 00:54:06,299
your interest in it and getting it into

00:54:01,419 --> 00:54:10,479
your budget now any other questions

00:54:06,299 --> 00:54:12,999
looks like that's everything okay great

00:54:10,479 --> 00:54:17,429
all right well now that does officially

00:54:12,999 --> 00:54:19,839
conclude our q4 supporter webcast and

00:54:17,429 --> 00:54:23,409

improvements happen and and we're really

00:54:29,380 --> 00:54:33,279
excited to start improving the front

00:54:31,419 --> 00:54:35,229

sales tool for you and we're going to

00:54:35,229 --> 00:54:39,279
