00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:36,380
significant contribution to the success

of the Drupal project so thank you so

00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:40,200
today what we're going to do is talk

00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:43,950
about first of all what does the

00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:46,170
association board do and how does it

00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:49,440
work we're going to talk about how do

00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:53,340
nominations for the community elections

00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:55,710
work for the community positions and who

00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:59,550
can run and how do you actually go about

00:00:55,710 --> 00:01:01,140
it so first of all what is the Drupal

00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:06,540
Association at Bard

00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:08,909
do well it thinks strategically and it

00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:11,790
does that based upon the Drupal

00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:14,100
Association mission which has been set

00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:17,820
for a number of years that mission is

00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:21,619
Drupal powers the best of the web the

00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:24,659
Drupal Association unites a global

00:01:21,619 --> 00:01:28,770
open-source community to build and

00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:33,210
promote Drupal now that's quite a big

00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:37,549
mission so who are the Drupal

00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:40,970
Association boredom well it's made up of

00:01:37,549 --> 00:01:44,159
three different types of director

00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:47,490
position we have a position or a seat

00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:50,549
called the founding director on this is

00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:55,969
a position that lasts one year and it is

00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:58,560
then reelected and it can only be filled

00:01:55,969 --> 00:02:02,820
by the founding director and that is

00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:08,179
Drita's we have a number of class

00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:12,690
directors who serve three-year terms and

00:02:08,179 --> 00:02:14,080
they are searched for and appointed by

00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:16,730
the board

00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:21,440
and we're usually looking for people who

00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:23,960
have lots of relevant experience both

00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:25,460
within Drupal and without outside Drupal

00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:28,330
so can bringing people in from other

00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:31,340
open source projects to give us

00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:34,550
understanding of a wider open source

00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:38,450
world and we then had the at-large

00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:42,080
directors these are currently two seats

00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:44,210
that are elected each and every other

00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,670
year so we elect one seat each year

00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:50,150
offset by one year and they last two

00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:53,120
years and this could be you it's why

00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:55,190
you're here they're elected by the

00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,860
community and ratified by the rest of

00:02:55,190 --> 00:03:03,470
the board to serve staggered two-year

00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:08,030
terms okay now as a board member should

00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:13,220
that be something that happens you have

00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:16,070
very specific duties you have a duty of

00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:18,880
care so that means that board members

00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:20,510
are expected to actively participate in

00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:23,090
organizational planning and

00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:27,040
decision-making after strategic level

00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:30,080
and to make sound and informed judgments

00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:33,470
so that means we have a number of we

00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:37,400
have two off-site meetings every year so

00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:42,739
that will mean flying in we have regular

00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:45,050
online meetings and so on normally board

00:03:42,739 --> 00:03:47,840
directors pay their own travel but we

00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:52,340
have an amount of funds to to help with

00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:53,050
that as necessary there's a duty of

00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:55,160
loyalty

00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:57,739
so when acting on behalf of the

00:03:55,160 --> 00:04:01,310
organization board members must put the

00:03:57,739 --> 00:04:03,320
interests of the nonprofit before any

00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:06,230
personal or professional concerns and

00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:10,520
avoid any potential conflicts of

00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:13,640
interests so this is a saying that you

00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:16,820
can't use the information that you learn

00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:18,709
on the board or try to influence it in a

00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:21,789
way that particularly benefits you

00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:24,680
personally or your business etc and

00:04:21,789 --> 00:04:27,150
should you find yourself looking at a

00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:29,340
strategic decision that

00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:31,350
might put you in a position of conflict

00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:33,120
and interest you need to notify the rest

00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:36,389
of the board and then obviously step

00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:39,090
back for that particular thing finally

00:04:36,389 --> 00:04:41,220
there's a duty of obedience the board is

00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:44,580
responsible for and ensure that the

00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:49,169
organization complies with federal state

00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:52,020
and local laws and regulations and it

00:04:49,169 --> 00:04:54,720
remains committed to the mission that we

00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:58,440
mentioned earlier okay

00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:02,240
in practical terms that means at

00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:05,160
Assateague level you will be overseeing

00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,120
financial performance looking at the

00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:10,460
figures making sure we're doing

00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:14,550
everything right setting strategy

00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:18,630
setting and reviewing policies help in

00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:24,110
to fundraise and managing the executive

00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:24,110
director Megan Sena key you are her boss

00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:33,449
now every year the executive committee

00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:37,710
with inside they've bought the board of

00:05:33,449 --> 00:05:39,199
directors sets the focuses for the

00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:41,910
following year

00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:44,220
now it's worth going through these

00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:46,380
because this is the type of thing that

00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:48,740
you would be looking at so our focus is

00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:50,780
at the moment around strengthening

00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:55,110
sustainability of the Drupal Association

00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:57,120
making sure we've got the money and the

00:05:55,110 --> 00:06:01,770
strength to actually make positive

00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:04,409
change for the Drupal project we are

00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:07,470
looking at how we can grow drupelet

00:06:04,409 --> 00:06:09,930
adoption through our channels so by that

00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:12,930
we mean things like Drupal con and the

00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:15,659
drupal.org website and you will have

00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:17,370
seen the Drupal initiative and things

00:06:15,659 --> 00:06:19,919
that have been advertised recently and

00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:21,690
talking of so that there are all types

00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:24,840
of things along those lines helping to

00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:28,800
grow Drupal adoption we're also looking

00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:30,479
to evolve Drupal Dog improved

00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,250
continually improve that there's lots of

00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:34,260
things been happening over the last few

00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:35,940
months and there's lots lots we're

00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:40,650
looking at for the next few months and

00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:43,680
how we continually improve Drupal con

00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:47,160
and move that into the future now

00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:50,820
remember these are strategy focuses so

00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:53,430
this isn't looking at the detail this is

00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:56,730
looking at the overall picture and the

00:06:53,430 --> 00:07:03,050
direction and it's worth mentioning that

00:06:56,730 --> 00:07:07,290
if you come in as a community elected

00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:09,270
board member the things that the board

00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:11,820
will be working on are set by this

00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:14,040
executive committee they're not set by

00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:16,410
the individual so you won't be you will

00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:18,540
necessarily be able to bring in

00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:19,800
something that you've been a burning

00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:23,340
thought that's been at the top of your

00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:27,780
head and changed the direction of the

00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:31,290
whole board quite that easy it's it's

00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:36,630
this strategy is set centrally and

00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:38,460
that's what you'll be working on okay so

00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:44,790
how do nominations and elections

00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:47,370
actually work well candidates self

00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:49,770
nominate in other words you need to

00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:53,030
actually go in to the forum on the

00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:56,220
Association drupal.org website and

00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:59,400
actually nominate yourself you can't

00:07:56,220 --> 00:08:03,419
nominate somebody else that's not the

00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:05,910
way it works here so you need to

00:08:03,419 --> 00:08:07,740
actually nominate yourself absolutely if

00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:09,330
you feel that you want to speak to

00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:10,650
people and find out if people think that

00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:13,020
you're the right candidate

00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:14,850
etc or if you think there's a good

00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:17,460
candidate go speak to them say hey you

00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:19,830
should nominate but the person who

00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:23,810
actually wants to be nominated needs to

00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:26,160
do the actual work themselves okay

00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:27,960
nominations are accepted for during the

00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:31,410
short published time period and I've got

00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:33,479
a slide of that later as to what the the

00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:35,250
timescales are there's only a very short

00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:38,820
time and you'll be asked to share a

00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:41,310
short biography who you are you'll be

00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:43,860
asked to share a photo of yourself which

00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:46,140
you'll be able to upload you'll be asked

00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:51,480
about what is your motivation for

00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:53,370
running and you'll be asked for all why

00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,000
should we have you what is your relevant

00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:59,690
experience

00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:03,120
how are you going to be aware of what a

00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:06,690
board member is doing have you worked on

00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:09,900
previous boards of other nonprofits

00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:12,630
before etc that type of thing okay show

00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:14,460
some relevant experience and finally

00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:16,320
some contact information people are

00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:18,420
going to after going to want to have

00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,830
questions we're going to want to be able

00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:21,510
to contact you from the Drupal

00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:24,000
Association to talk about these things

00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:30,110
all those things will be on the

00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:32,820
nomination form we use a system called

00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:34,470
Instant Runoff voting we've used it for

00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:36,240
the last few years and it seems to be

00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:39,510
quite very successful at choosing some

00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:44,580
excellent board members over the last

00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:48,990
few years and what it does is we speak

00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:53,760
with the Drupal community we ask them to

00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:56,190
vote by ranking each candidate one to

00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:58,860
ten type thing okay depending on how

00:09:56,190 --> 00:10:00,630
many they are the voting itself to the

00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:02,880
to the main Drupal community will be

00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:05,850
open for about a week and there's a very

00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:09,990
specific indication here of who's

00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:13,470
actually eligible to vote so anyone who

00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:17,430
has a Drupal durog account who was being

00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:19,740
logged in during the past year and as a

00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:23,610
count was registered before nominations

00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:25,589
opened is eligible to vote so you can't

00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:28,800
make if account hasn't been used for

00:10:25,589 --> 00:10:30,450
years they won't be able to vote and if

00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:35,300
it'll it's someone starts making loads

00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:39,740
of accounts now they won't work okay

00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:46,050
okay well who can run well actually

00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:47,400
anyone can run having said that you

00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:49,530
stand a much better chance of being

00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:51,180
successful if you can demonstrate these

00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:54,480
things because it's going to make your

00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:57,890
life easier as a Drupal Association

00:10:54,480 --> 00:11:01,650
Board member later you're gonna need or

00:10:57,890 --> 00:11:03,390
you're going to benefit from having of

00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:04,950
the board experience have you been

00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:05,730
somewhere where you have done this type

00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:07,920
of thing before

00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:08,220
not necessarily on the same scale as the

00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,360
troupe

00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:13,620
Association maybe on a smaller scale but

00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:18,120
something to show that you can do this

00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:19,830
type of thing because you're working at

00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:21,420
the strategic level of the Drupal

00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:25,470
Association and the Drupal project

00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:28,200
overall a lot of that is about finance

00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:31,680
and understanding trying ads and being

00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:33,870
able to read financial documents being

00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:38,430

00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:41,000
lot also have if you can demonstrate

00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:44,970
that you have been involved in various

00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:48,420
Drupal community committees or working

00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:52,350
groups etc before that's going to stand

00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:54,930
you in great stead and also have you

00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:57,870
actually done some strategic planning in

00:11:54,930 --> 00:12:00,180
the past and only policy development

00:11:57,870 --> 00:12:02,520
those things being able to demonstrate

00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:07,740

00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:11,760
