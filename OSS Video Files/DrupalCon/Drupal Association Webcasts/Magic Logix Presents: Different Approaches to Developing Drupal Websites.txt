00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:16,680
Drupal websites just a little bit about

00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:19,220

Drupal community and and need help with

00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:50,460

senior web developers and it's by far

00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:59,580
one of the best people that I could

00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:01,050
think of to do this webinar was so we're

00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:02,910
really excited to kind of get going

00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:06,450
talking with you guys this morning I'm

00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:08,040
excited too so I'm going to tell you a

00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:10,980
little bit just a quick rundown about

00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:13,080
magic models who we are what we do we're

00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:15,030
an integrated marketing agency and at

00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:17,490
florin mention were also drupal

00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:19,620
association supporting partners so as

00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:22,950
far as integrated marketing goes I like

00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:25,140
to look at kind of four big areas of web

00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:27,350
design web development search engine and

00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:30,420
social marketing very social marketing

00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:32,580
social media marketing however we also

00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:36,030
do marketing automation and e-commerce

00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:38,489
services as well we create a lot of

00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:40,650
responsive websites and use a lot of

00:03:38,489 --> 00:03:42,989
Drupal and we're out here in Dallas

00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:45,690
Texas the wonderful state of Texas we've

00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:49,140
been active since 2004 so just about a

00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:51,360
decade now um as far as this webinar

00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:53,190
goes we plan to kind of look at a lot of

00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,870
projects we've worked on and give you

00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:57,989
guys some insight on different group of

00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:59,160
projects so we've basically locked it

00:03:57,989 --> 00:04:00,870
down to different approaches and

00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:02,910
development there's an easy way to

00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:04,500
Drupal development and kind of a more

00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:06,360
advanced approach so what we're going to

00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:08,550
do is kind of go through both those

00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:10,680
methods see what we would quantify is

00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:12,239
the easy way and then also look at it

00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:16,500
maybe a more advanced approach and see

00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:18,120
how both of these can provide insight

00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:20,820
into building your own websites for

00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:22,620
Drupal we're also going to look at three

00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:25,169
different examples challenges and

00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:27,180
solutions for other web projects so we

00:04:25,169 --> 00:04:27,450
quantify these and do a smaller website

00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:29,940
and

00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:32,220
website and a large scale project so

00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:34,260
this way we actually give you specific

00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:35,730
examples and that's where sam takes a

00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:38,340
look into the coding and all the

00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:40,980
wonderful wonderful things that he does

00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:45,060
in that room that i will never

00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:46,740
comprehend myself so we're going to look

00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:48,660
at also how to approach each type of

00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:51,180
project and then we've also got a little

00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:54,240
section talking about a modern workflow

00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:56,520
for drupal development so without

00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,770
further ado I'm going to get Sam in here

00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:03,830
on the easy way of Drupal bone to start

00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:07,380
this discussion a penguin Chris so and

00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:10,590
the story i would like to start up by

00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:15,090
saying i'm not a drupal expert but I'm

00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:20,010
getting there okay yeah so um this is a

00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:23,130
list of slides with prepared and it's

00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:27,090
the you know result of some years of

00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:29,930
experience using Drupal and so let's

00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:34,140
start by talking about the easy way of

00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:36,870
Drupal development so once you set up

00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:40,680
once you install a trooper by default

00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:44,190
Drupal gives you you know some core

00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:48,210
modules and Mike cell triple is a very

00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:52,380
strong CMS outside it's one of the best

00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:55,410
CMS open source so the first thing that

00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:58,590
you do you know when you wanna you know

00:05:55,410 --> 00:06:01,320
develop Drupal in an easy way the first

00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:04,950
thing that you do is install a pin you

00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:07,320
can start by using Bayes themes like the

00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:10,200
genting the bootstrap there are plenty

00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:13,410
of things out there and I think you can

00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:15,330
also buy a lot of teams out there in the

00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:18,440
marketplace there any favorite thing of

00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:20,640
yours or well I use bootstrap and

00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:23,070
foundation a lot but their base teams

00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:27,180
and we will talk about that later on and

00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:29,220
the next thing that you do is um well I

00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:32,480
forgot to mention you always plan ahead

00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:35,610
your website before you even start so

00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:38,400
I'm assuming you already done that so

00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:40,710
once you have your theme installed and

00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:43,260
the next thing that you do is install

00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:46,620
modules and the good thing about Drupal

00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:49,980
is you have an endless list of you know

00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:53,610
modules built by the community you know

00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:56,190
and you can get modules you can you know

00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:59,760
install for any purposes do you want

00:06:56,190 --> 00:07:03,240
click the youtube video vimeo you know

00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:04,590
do you want to go side to be social you

00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:09,000
know there are models for anything

00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:11,160
they've won well that's the thing about

00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,880
to possess a module for for everything

00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:17,790
that it wants SEO social sharing youtube

00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:20,700
ecommerce they're really great ecommerce

00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:23,280
you know modules and we will talk about

00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:30,330
that later on but we have something

00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:34,980
called the well will we talk about that

00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:36,720
later one but that we have well

00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:39,600
basically modules for everything that

00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:43,140
you want in a website so modern web site

00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:45,510
will need these basic things you know

00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:47,430
social is very important right now SEO

00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:50,040
is very important your media is very

00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:53,460
important so you have models for

00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:56,610
everything in Drupal so in the easy way

00:07:53,460 --> 00:08:00,750
you you install you find your module in

00:07:56,610 --> 00:08:05,250
Drupal dirt work you know and install

00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:06,960
the module for your site yes this was at

00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:08,580
what has taught me but sometimes if you

00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:12,000
get which are trying to say right away

00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:14,040
to this really sense I'm sorry so we

00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,380
have full featured Drupal distributions

00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:19,740
creative force basic types of sites okay

00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:23,550
and the commerce kickstart is really

00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:26,040
really big and this is for people when

00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:30,120
you know jumpstart your e-commerce

00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:31,680
website and they can get ready but let

00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:36,540
me talk about Drupal distributions a bit

00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:38,880
out it's it's a set of modules and you

00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:41,700
know profiles that that's ready to you

00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:43,500
know for a type of website there there's

00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:46,230
only two different kinds of websites for

00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:49,500
example maybe we will sites there for

00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:52,170
you know education purposes we both

00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:54,400
sites for new charity those kind of

00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:57,250
stuff you know so we have almost

00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:59,500
extra we have open bought this open

00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:01,900
office and philetus a lot of religious

00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:04,480
reasons and not all of them are

00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:07,120
acceptable or I mean we are also

00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:12,600
developing distribution for our own

00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:15,850
purposes right so you can you can either

00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:18,550
you know install the vanilla Drupal and

00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:21,760
install you know whatever modules you

00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:25,870
need as you go or you can get a head

00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:28,960
start using a Drupal distribution so

00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:32,290
it's your basic approach them I will get

00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:36,490
that get to that in a moment okay so yes

00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:39,310
the basic approach you first install

00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:41,920
your Drupal that's the vanilla Drupal

00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:44,380
modules you know just downloaded from

00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:46,810
super org all you install a Drupal

00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:49,270
distribution the next thing that you do

00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:51,640
is install I think it doesn't have to be

00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:56,740
necessarily this but if I was starting a

00:09:51,640 --> 00:10:00,100
very basic website then I would I'll do

00:09:56,740 --> 00:10:02,580
it this way and you set up and configure

00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:05,500
your modules you know and you're thin

00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:07,180
and the next thing that you do is create

00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:10,960
a content types and the content types

00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:14,470
are really really important they are

00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:16,890
basically different types of data that

00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:20,860
you have on your website beat articles

00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:24,190
blog team members anything you can think

00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:26,860
of in ascetic data and the last thing

00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:29,140
that it is at data well this is just one

00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:32,500
approach you know a very basic approach

00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:36,570
you don't have to follow it but this is

00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:41,460
one way to do it and this is this is

00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:41,460
typically very not for small websites ah

00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:48,990
but there are trade-offs using the easy

00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:53,790
way you know if you are a developer and

00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:56,440
you looked at you know the mark-up that

00:10:53,790 --> 00:11:00,010
Drupal produces that's that's one of the

00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:03,430
trade-offs of using Drupal out of the

00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:08,140
box without any overrides you see a lot

00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:08,320
of markup you see a lot of CSS and when

00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:10,240
you

00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,610
look at the market that is produced

00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:15,670
produced you see a lot of elaborate

00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:18,610
class names you know but they are there

00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:24,310
for a reason because they help you style

00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:26,020
your websites and and and without having

00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:28,510
to create your own classics and adding

00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:30,670
class names is really really difficult

00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:34,810
if you do not know how to add fast names

00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:36,820
to to your components and the like I

00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:39,760
said they add a lot of CSS and

00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:41,260
JavaScript and the more the CSS and

00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:44,440
JavaScript that you have in a website

00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:47,550
destroy a slower your sites are going to

00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:49,780
be so those are the trade-offs of using

00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:54,900
those are just two of the trade-offs if

00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:57,510
using the triple in the easy way and

00:11:54,900 --> 00:12:01,870
yeah it's really difficult to change

00:11:57,510 --> 00:12:04,120
anything if the model that you just

00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:06,790
downloaded and using does not have the

00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:10,830
exact same visa that you need meaning

00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:13,960
say you have you you want to have social

00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:16,270
there are modules for doing that they're

00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:19,420
much looks like sheer this add this and

00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:21,880
when you do that if you're not exactly

00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:24,160
they'll work the same year that same way

00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:26,620
that you need it to book like you can

00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:30,670
have a module that embed a YouTube video

00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:32,800
but you want that module to you know do

00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:37,030
something before it you know our vendors

00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:39,520
the YouTube video maybe you want the how

00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:42,640
long the YouTube video plays for example

00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:44,620
it's five second five minutes in some

00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:46,660
some seconds you want to show that it

00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:49,480
the motive that you install does not do

00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:53,280
that so it's really difficult to change

00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:53,280
something you know if the model does not

00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:59,620
support that so that's one of the

00:12:55,690 --> 00:13:02,830
trade-offs and and the the most

00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:10,120
important trade off I mean is that if

00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:12,250
you're using modules for four I mean you

00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:16,090
always use models but because there are

00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:19,360
so many modules in in the easy way you'd

00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:21,280
be everything by using modules then

00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,670
there's a chance you're going to break

00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:24,490
this I

00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:27,700
if some some module bricks and we see a

00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:30,700
lot of that problems when clients come

00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:32,680
to us and they say well my site is

00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:34,360
broken and it's it sometimes it's

00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:37,990
because of simple modules that's not

00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:40,630
working that's not updated so good you

00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:46,510
have it those are the trade-offs of the

00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:49,240
easy way of Drupal development all right

00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:50,560
so kind of looking at the easy way and

00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:52,740
before we get into what's the hard way

00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:55,240
which is really more of an advanced way

00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:57,820
that's with the easy way of discussing

00:13:55,240 --> 00:14:00,340
is good for smbs can use that for

00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:02,710
large-scale fight or no no I would not

00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:04,420
okay um it's at least good for setup

00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:06,880
then and then of course the hard way

00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:09,220
let's get into this um even though we've

00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:11,350
got the little frowny face drupal guy

00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:13,390
it's really not kind of as far as you

00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:15,520
would you would think in that sense do

00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:17,560
you mean it more of an advanced oh I'd

00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:20,650
like to think of this guy as did you

00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:22,840
mean they're not angry alright fair

00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:27,580
enough this is ready to get it out there

00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:29,740
sir but it's not really that hard and it

00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:31,630
might be a nice no brown it's the

00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:36,280
advanced weights the I think it's the

00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:39,280
right way drink rupa & but it requests

00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:42,310
you know some knowledge of drupal the

00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:47,290
underlying technology that the api's mal

00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:49,780
Drupal works you know nodes and entities

00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:50,950
you know those kind of stuff users so

00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:53,950
you need to you need to really

00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:55,930
understand the underlying technology to

00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:57,610
Drupal the right way so we're going to

00:14:55,930 --> 00:14:59,050
get more in a customization that max

00:14:57,610 --> 00:15:04,470
with that is correct it's all about

00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:07,750
customization okay and and it is it is

00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:10,270
it has been easy to do the hard way

00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:13,270
because Drupal has a very soil tapi you

00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:18,360
know it has a great community and

00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:23,170
there's a lot of lot of active members

00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:25,570
we have you know who selflessly promote

00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:27,910
Drupal and you know give to the

00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:30,520
community so that's the that's the good

00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:35,440
thing about Drupal is you can customize

00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:39,100
it because it has as such great platform

00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:42,130
Joanna okay what exactly is the hard way

00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:45,100
it's it's it's like drupal already out

00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:46,660
of box does some things very good you

00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:52,870
know you can create content types that

00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:55,450
outer box in terms of seven and but it

00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:57,790
does not well when you create a note a

00:15:55,450 --> 00:16:00,700
content type and I'm getting into more

00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:03,790
technical you know I'm getting more

00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:05,320
technical here but I think this is

00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:08,350
necessary because we're talking about

00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:11,320
the hard way when you will you create

00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:16,570
our content type by default it produces

00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:19,410
it renders a markup that mainly may not

00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:23,140
necessarily be what you what you need no

00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:29,200
and you may have content types you know

00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:33,280
a layout a theme that you know is is

00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:35,560
very customized for your website and to

00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:40,300
do that may not be possible using you

00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:42,760
know the default Drupal rendering so it

00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:44,680
allows you that the hard way is actually

00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:47,770
building custom fields to look exactly

00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:49,600
the way you want exactly what your

00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:52,450
designer gives you so that's the hard

00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:54,370
way and to do that you either build

00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:56,980
custom modules to exactly match

00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:59,500
informants by custom models we're not

00:16:56,980 --> 00:17:01,480
talking about reinventing the way that's

00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:03,490
very important we're not trying to be in

00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:06,990
that the will so if there are models out

00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:10,420
there that do those things very good and

00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:13,480
those are you know used by thousands of

00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:17,199
websites that are well documented or

00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:20,230
well maintained that produced you know

00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:23,110
bug patches that have security updates

00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:25,990
very regular security updates that you

00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:29,110
must use those kind of modules but I'm

00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:32,680
talking about letting customers for your

00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:35,230
requirements and for websites that we've

00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:39,810
built we've always had to build some

00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:43,360
orders so that's the thing so the

00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:44,710
advanced clear using Drupal is you built

00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:47,330
your custom workers for your

00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:50,570
requirements so that's one thing

00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:53,149
and build custom behavior that otherwise

00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:56,360
doesn't exist in Drupal so it might be

00:17:53,149 --> 00:17:59,720
you know on something that triple

00:17:56,360 --> 00:18:02,980
doesn't do by default for example you

00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:06,140
want to have you know when someone

00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:08,899
updates a content type you're a

00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:11,809
particular role and email is sent out

00:18:08,899 --> 00:18:14,990
you know there are those in project what

00:18:11,809 --> 00:18:18,200
we did was it was called a system status

00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:20,860
space and you could subscribe to that

00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:24,289
basic list so when something changed

00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:29,500
then anyone subscribe to that page would

00:18:24,289 --> 00:18:31,970
get get emailed you know um um I think

00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:34,460
there could be a model that existed I

00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:37,130
did not look for that module but I think

00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:41,570
I try it but we ended up building our

00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:44,360
own module that one so custom behavior

00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:49,010
that's that's the that's another thing

00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:51,850
that makes it the hard way so here are

00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:54,799
some rules to understand when you are

00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:57,049
thinking about building a website the

00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:59,600
the advanced way use money

00:18:57,049 --> 00:19:01,760
production-ready modules so how do you

00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:05,090
know some modules of production ready

00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:07,370
you need to look at the status of Drupal

00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:10,760
modules when you when you when you go to

00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:12,110
a mod a project a module project and you

00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:14,090
see whether it's not it it's

00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:16,010
well-maintained whether it is it's in

00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:17,659
beta weather is it Dave whether its

00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:22,149
production ready you can see how many

00:19:17,659 --> 00:19:24,889
websites are using it you can see be

00:19:22,149 --> 00:19:27,289
demography you and you can also see the

00:19:24,889 --> 00:19:30,130
bug reports if there's a lot of bug

00:19:27,289 --> 00:19:33,370
reports you may not want to use that and

00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:37,730
you can also find a list of mortals that

00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:40,880
are are useful to use in all projects

00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:42,980
for example views and displace with that

00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:45,740
those are the models we always use and

00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:47,960
the next important thing is use models

00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:52,370
very sparingly you do not want to use a

00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:54,169
lot modules for big science and there's

00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:58,500
some really good reasons for that one

00:19:54,169 --> 00:20:00,870
and we'll talk about that later on and

00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:02,730
the important thing is the next

00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:06,480
important thing is you plan your content

00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:09,000
types and fields ahead of time and this

00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:12,030
is really important this is this is all

00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:15,410
planning a great website is not only

00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:19,290
built by developers you have to include

00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:22,020
designers marketers you have to include

00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:25,350
content writers you wanna you want to

00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:29,040
learn what as a developer I always try

00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:30,720
to you know talk to designers will end

00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:33,900
up using the website has a meaning what

00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:36,210
if you build a website that your your

00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:37,710
admin was going to end up using the

00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:40,830
website doesn't understand how to use

00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:45,450
and that's one thing true book has you

00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:48,600
know got some things to fix and i think

00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:52,500
it's it's it's going the direction now

00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:55,020
yes drupal is not really you know

00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:57,210
user-friendly in the back end once

00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:59,070
that's something we hear a lot of times

00:20:57,210 --> 00:21:01,590
with friends you know we have to walk

00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:03,300
them through a lot of Europe and menus

00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:06,420
because they are accustomed to using

00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:10,290
WordPress or you know a one click

00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:11,670
solution and it's up to a V developers

00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:14,880
to make that easy for that the

00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:17,340
transition so that's that's important so

00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:21,090
yeah planning content types and feels

00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:23,580
ahead of time that lets you get pink and

00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:26,850
you can also you know get get in touch

00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:29,280
with your your content writers and see

00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:33,060
if they can use it that's really

00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:36,720
important and and this is one of the

00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:38,370
core requirements of adding the Drupal

00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:41,700
be hard way is you write your own

00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:44,670
templates for Pacers four nodes or blogs

00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:47,580
reviews because the Drupal allows that

00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:51,810
you know you can you can you can clean

00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:54,320
your note pro content type you can you

00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:57,030
can target views you can target blogs

00:21:54,320 --> 00:22:01,250
and that's this is this is something

00:21:57,030 --> 00:22:03,690
i'll talk about in detail in a minute

00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:05,490
well then looking at the hardware of

00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:07,530
drupal development or the more advanced

00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:09,780
by obviously customization is really

00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:10,860
really clutch just kind of in summation

00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:13,020
of that which is

00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:15,240
which is really really good that's kind

00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:17,220
of a nice way to add your own spin and

00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:19,620
taste on it you know obviously if we're

00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:21,240
looking at it choosing your approach big

00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:23,309
factors are going to be time and your

00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:25,559
level of comfort I think like a very

00:22:23,309 --> 00:22:28,710
very high level of comfort or at least

00:22:25,559 --> 00:22:30,840
moderate would say be approach to doing

00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:34,410
so much customization obviously but then

00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:37,140
also to knowing what kind of scale site

00:22:34,410 --> 00:22:38,850
you're building at so you know with with

00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:40,470
that in mind as we go here we're going

00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:42,330
to talk a little bit about choosing your

00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:43,530
approach we don't look at a few tips and

00:22:42,330 --> 00:22:45,780
then we're finally going to get into

00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:47,220
give some of these real-life examples of

00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:49,470
what we've been talking about so you can

00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:52,620
see kind of using panels and things that

00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:53,940
we've done for all approach so I'll kind

00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:58,530
of let you take it from there regarding

00:22:53,940 --> 00:23:02,730
these next tips there Sam yeah so well

00:22:58,530 --> 00:23:07,049
let me just um tell you this the easy

00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:09,600
way and the note the category is not

00:23:07,049 --> 00:23:11,549
just the two different approaches you

00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:14,700
can take this is really important to

00:23:11,549 --> 00:23:19,890
understand these are the two ends of the

00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:23,370
spectrum of the things you can do you

00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:24,900
can combine you know you can you can do

00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:27,750
a lot of things and will so in the

00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:30,059
examples of sites we've done sometimes

00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:32,970
it's important to use a lot modules

00:23:30,059 --> 00:23:38,100
because you don't have the time you know

00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:42,660
sometimes you know there's budget

00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:45,720
constraint sometimes there will be a lot

00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:48,299
of factors in deciding whether to use

00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:52,260
the easy way to be hard way but often

00:23:48,299 --> 00:23:54,140
gets its be compromised the easy way in

00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:58,140
the hard way there's just all this

00:23:54,140 --> 00:24:02,220
hundreds of you know lines between those

00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:04,890
two approaches so the fact is that you

00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:07,950
must consider whether or not to devote a

00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:10,410
lot of time customizing Drupal is what

00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:13,590
how much time you have for the profits

00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:15,299
if it has to be submitted you know I has

00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:18,270
to be production ready in a certain box

00:24:15,299 --> 00:24:21,150
time and you know that customizing

00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:23,690
Drupal to exact specification could take

00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:26,610
you both wasn't that time I mean

00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:32,690
if you plan it ahead of time you can

00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:35,759
always you know come to a compromise but

00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:39,649
so the time that you need and the level

00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:43,139
of comfort meaning how much level of

00:24:39,649 --> 00:24:46,620
confidence you have using a certain part

00:24:43,139 --> 00:24:50,700
of Drupal template in a certain part of

00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:52,529
Drupal but they were so you have to you

00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:54,679
have to consider how much time you want

00:24:52,529 --> 00:24:58,019
to deport you know and how much

00:24:54,679 --> 00:25:02,009
proficient you are in Drupal before you

00:24:58,019 --> 00:25:05,340
decide what approach to tech so I always

00:25:02,009 --> 00:25:08,639
recommend a compromise if you have

00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:12,059
limited time and limited comfort using

00:25:08,639 --> 00:25:16,470
Drupal and here are some tips where

00:25:12,059 --> 00:25:18,869
we're talking about if you have Jews

00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:20,879
Drupal a lot you'll find using same

00:25:18,869 --> 00:25:24,240
kinds of modules the same types of

00:25:20,879 --> 00:25:26,549
content types a lot so here's a tip you

00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:29,340
create profiles for frequently used

00:25:26,549 --> 00:25:33,029
project types and you'd end up creating

00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:35,879
your own distributions all you could use

00:25:33,029 --> 00:25:41,639
a triple distributions for head start

00:25:35,879 --> 00:25:45,529
just some other two nice tips and you

00:25:41,639 --> 00:25:49,710
can reuse a lot of codes that you use

00:25:45,529 --> 00:25:54,059
many times I just github gifts and I can

00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:55,259
insert them I use the template PHP file

00:25:54,059 --> 00:25:58,169
a lot because there are some functions

00:25:55,259 --> 00:26:01,590
that I use a lot and it's it's really

00:25:58,169 --> 00:26:05,070
easy for me to insert those bit of

00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:08,100
snippets inside my coat faster so this

00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:09,720
is one one thing I could do and this is

00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:11,789
really important you must follow the

00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:14,460
triple best practices and getting back

00:26:11,789 --> 00:26:16,259
to installing less models this is if you

00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:19,799
read the Drupal best practices this is

00:26:16,259 --> 00:26:23,700
what the recommendations use use as less

00:26:19,799 --> 00:26:25,799
modules as possible and but you must

00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:28,230
remember this is this is a good tip you

00:26:25,799 --> 00:26:32,129
a customization is not always better it

00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:36,900
is not update proof so if you update if

00:26:32,129 --> 00:26:38,970
you hook to a model that updates and

00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:41,250
does not support that hook or you know

00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:44,070
it really happens but you must consider

00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:46,650
it must your customization must be

00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:54,690
update Brooke and you must also update

00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:56,910
your code ok so we will talk about this

00:26:54,690 --> 00:27:00,300
is the range of so going from small

00:26:56,910 --> 00:27:03,630
sites to Lars and enterprise sites yes

00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:09,560
sir the bullet list of things that you

00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:13,920
must think about so modules and themes

00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:16,950
and tasting production servers in small

00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:20,130
sites I will I mean it's it's

00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:21,930
recommended that use testing stays in

00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:27,350
the production service for all your

00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:30,120
projects but in the real world there

00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:32,130
some some developers they are stuck in

00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:35,730
some countries you're stuck with using

00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:38,250
you know seared service servers some

00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:40,260
people must develop locally and the

00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:45,030
machines before they can upload the

00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:46,590
final code to the server so / for loss

00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:51,060
on enterprise eggs are not recommend

00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:54,420
that but ok let's start from from the

00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:57,060
modules it's for small site it's more

00:27:54,420 --> 00:28:01,440
beneficial if you installed modules

00:27:57,060 --> 00:28:04,560
rather than you know I you know creating

00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:06,510
all your own modules you also might have

00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:10,830
to trade off you know functionality in

00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:13,950
small really small sites if you if you

00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:18,090
do not want you rather have to you know

00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:22,740
modify your and this is this is the sad

00:28:18,090 --> 00:28:27,450
part for four modules some some modules

00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:29,310
if you really need to I'm going off on a

00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:31,410
tangent so I just stop right there I

00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:36,360
know we have some limited time so I'll

00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:37,730
speed up okay um and this is this is

00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:40,500
this is the this is the biggest

00:28:37,730 --> 00:28:41,940
differences I think the cleaning is the

00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:44,850
biggest differences that I must I must

00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:46,680
talk about this you can use you can use

00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:48,030
panels you displace your analyzer

00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:50,370
there's so many different options you

00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:53,370
can use to create

00:28:50,370 --> 00:28:56,190
layouts for smaller sites and it's much

00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:59,550
faster that way but for Lars interpret

00:28:56,190 --> 00:29:01,890
as sites you have to overwrite your

00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:04,260
paces notes and blogs and use you know

00:29:01,890 --> 00:29:06,480
to get the exact specification if you

00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:09,120
haven't looked at really nice sites they

00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:11,550
have such beautiful layouts and to do

00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:14,550
that you know you have to do some work

00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:19,230
and a lot of people have done work on

00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:23,070
really great sites so I'm going to give

00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:25,830
you an example of a really small part of

00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:29,340
a website and take a look it's it's the

00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:33,000
footer of uh it's it's fairly complex we

00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:36,330
have two columns on the right side you

00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:38,370
have a logo and some some menu items

00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:42,540
it's a food a menu on the left side we

00:29:38,370 --> 00:29:45,210
have a lock and there's so many

00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:48,690
different ways you could do is I'll show

00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:52,710
you some examples so we can there's a

00:29:48,690 --> 00:29:55,559
mortal out there using panels you can

00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:58,730
build if you're if you're in real hurry

00:29:55,559 --> 00:30:04,260
you can build a custom layout so

00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:08,330
remember we had two two columns and we

00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:11,670
want to build that you can use the

00:30:08,330 --> 00:30:15,450
Builder function in the in the in the

00:30:11,670 --> 00:30:17,490
panels and you can create using the

00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:20,850
layout designer so I have fear that a

00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:24,840
recent left-footer right and credit

00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:27,090
there's also a credit at the bottom this

00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:29,910
was created using the layout designer no

00:30:27,090 --> 00:30:34,530
coding needed and this is this is really

00:30:29,910 --> 00:30:35,970
fast it takes two minutes and once you

00:30:34,530 --> 00:30:39,809
do that you can start adding your

00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:42,780
content like this so you have the blog

00:30:39,809 --> 00:30:45,450
block on the left the site logo and the

00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:48,559
footer menu and the right hand side and

00:30:45,450 --> 00:30:55,020
the credit we have a custom block and

00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:57,900
this is fast okay so once you have the

00:30:55,020 --> 00:31:02,370
footer mini panel ready and you can

00:30:57,900 --> 00:31:03,779
start adding your your content using the

00:31:02,370 --> 00:31:07,139
blocks you I

00:31:03,779 --> 00:31:09,239
and also you've been market that's

00:31:07,139 --> 00:31:13,789
generated using the mini pan and this is

00:31:09,239 --> 00:31:16,080
this is what's the difference and I

00:31:13,789 --> 00:31:21,269
don't think you can you can see you took

00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:24,809
this markup but there's a lot of flora

00:31:21,269 --> 00:31:27,749
markup and this is there for a reason

00:31:24,809 --> 00:31:31,979
like I said previous you use this markup

00:31:27,749 --> 00:31:34,529
the panels produce this markup so that

00:31:31,979 --> 00:31:38,999
we can style it you can use the styles

00:31:34,529 --> 00:31:41,609
and the classes and style them there's a

00:31:38,999 --> 00:31:44,009
slightly better way this is a one step

00:31:41,609 --> 00:31:47,190
further you can create our own layout

00:31:44,009 --> 00:31:53,210
using four panels remember we use a

00:31:47,190 --> 00:31:56,339
custom a layout using the designer

00:31:53,210 --> 00:32:00,690
function but this another way you can

00:31:56,339 --> 00:32:04,529
create own files it's it's using the

00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:08,729
mini panel layout interface and I'm

00:32:04,529 --> 00:32:10,349
sorry you use your own layout and those

00:32:08,729 --> 00:32:16,729
are in code let me show you this example

00:32:10,349 --> 00:32:20,210
so we are we are describing a layout and

00:32:16,729 --> 00:32:23,940
if you want we can we can publish this

00:32:20,210 --> 00:32:26,309
code in our site later on for you use

00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:31,019
this is just an example so I'm

00:32:26,309 --> 00:32:33,749
describing a layout that has three

00:32:31,019 --> 00:32:37,889
reasons a footer left of food row right

00:32:33,749 --> 00:32:42,779
and credit and this is described in this

00:32:37,889 --> 00:32:44,639
PHP file and here's the markup this is

00:32:42,779 --> 00:32:47,700
the market that you want we do not want

00:32:44,639 --> 00:32:51,359
a lot of classes because we're going to

00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:53,789
style it like we need so I'm using room

00:32:51,359 --> 00:32:57,589
that if you look at it and for those who

00:32:53,789 --> 00:33:02,779
know bootstrap you'll see that there's

00:32:57,589 --> 00:33:08,820
bootstrap classes your container row six

00:33:02,779 --> 00:33:11,669
column and a sixth column and custom

00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:17,309
class and this would have been real

00:33:11,669 --> 00:33:19,769
difficult using the default layout

00:33:17,309 --> 00:33:23,429
to designer and this is the markup we

00:33:19,769 --> 00:33:27,929
have will just insert the content using

00:33:23,429 --> 00:33:29,730
a PHP and this is the this is what you

00:33:27,929 --> 00:33:32,249
see we can we can style it so that it

00:33:29,730 --> 00:33:33,720
looks the food let is actually on the

00:33:32,249 --> 00:33:37,470
left-hand photo right is actually in the

00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:39,389
right but we're saving time here and you

00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:41,779
use you add the content like you did

00:33:39,389 --> 00:33:46,110
you'd like you always do in using panels

00:33:41,779 --> 00:33:48,870
and here's the market that is produced

00:33:46,110 --> 00:33:52,259
so you see the mark-up is greatly

00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:57,080
reduced here so it does not doesn't have

00:33:52,259 --> 00:34:00,529
though it does have some trances that

00:33:57,080 --> 00:34:05,490
that is produced outside this this

00:34:00,529 --> 00:34:07,649
layout block but still that the the

00:34:05,490 --> 00:34:12,899
market that is produced inside is much

00:34:07,649 --> 00:34:15,990
less now here's the history but way I do

00:34:12,899 --> 00:34:20,990
it if the fuller is a really important

00:34:15,990 --> 00:34:24,540
reason I tend to create it's it's own

00:34:20,990 --> 00:34:27,560
reasons in the theme info file so the

00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:33,210
team info file is where you create your

00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:39,200
reasons for using the website and we use

00:34:33,210 --> 00:34:39,200
that to add content using the blocks UI

00:34:40,129 --> 00:34:51,690
and on the front end on this is the part

00:34:46,829 --> 00:34:56,819
of the footer and we just rendering

00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:59,190
using PHP the footer left for the right

00:34:56,819 --> 00:35:04,800
and the creative reasons that we

00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:07,020
described in the info file so this is

00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:16,980
this is one other way to do it and it

00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:20,130
produces a little less markup okay the

00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:24,660
good thing about using a custom template

00:35:20,130 --> 00:35:29,579
yes like I mentioned just solely an

00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:30,470
example it produces less markup and it

00:35:29,579 --> 00:35:32,210
doesn't rely

00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:34,760
and the panel's model so if you did not

00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:38,300
have panels module and if you're using

00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:40,550
panels model just for layout purposes

00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:43,220
and you do not have a complex

00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:47,380
functionality you can get rid of the

00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:50,780
panel's module and just just using the

00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:52,880
drupal reasons and adding content from

00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:55,820
the blocks you I so didn't have it you

00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:58,930
can get rid of one dependency as you cut

00:35:55,820 --> 00:36:04,940
away one dependency that's a good thing

00:35:58,930 --> 00:36:06,859
in short like less is always better you

00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:12,530
can do similar things in other places

00:36:06,859 --> 00:36:15,770
you can have custom templates pieces you

00:36:12,530 --> 00:36:18,020
can you can you can team certain bases

00:36:15,770 --> 00:36:22,960
differently than other pieces you do not

00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:25,869
have to rely on the pace Madison module

00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:29,240
also sign please give you examples here

00:36:25,869 --> 00:36:33,890
phases you can either custom template or

00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:35,750
you can use the pace manager module if

00:36:33,890 --> 00:36:37,760
you doing it the easy way we had to

00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:41,599
create different layouts for different

00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:45,170
paces then due to the pieces manager

00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:48,320
module by default blocks are rendered

00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:52,700
with your block IVs and some classes you

00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:55,010
know you can if you if you do not like

00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:58,910
singles classes do not like the markup

00:36:55,010 --> 00:37:01,040
you can always change that override the

00:36:58,910 --> 00:37:04,640
blocks and notes has really important a

00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:10,220
lot of content a lot of pieces that we

00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:13,820
have in Drupal there from nodes and you

00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:17,089
can you can override notes you can you

00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:19,670
can keep a node using custom templates

00:37:17,089 --> 00:37:21,770
or you can use a lot of different models

00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:24,369
and you can use something called panner

00:37:21,770 --> 00:37:30,170
eyes panel Iser and that lets you create

00:37:24,369 --> 00:37:34,570
a fairly complex layout and add

00:37:30,170 --> 00:37:39,109
different contents into the note page

00:37:34,570 --> 00:37:41,900
but you can always do it you know from

00:37:39,109 --> 00:37:44,080
from from from a template file you can

00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:44,080
also

00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:51,910
overnight feels so if you want a field

00:37:47,770 --> 00:37:54,160
to render that certain way you have to

00:37:51,910 --> 00:37:57,610
overwrite that field and there are a lot

00:37:54,160 --> 00:38:01,990
of modules that overwrite fields one

00:37:57,610 --> 00:38:04,630
example is the YouTube more do you need

00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:09,340
taught that module and what it did to do

00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:14,680
is I get to either a render on the front

00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:17,170
end the in the preview image or render

00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:19,960
the actual video embed the video in an

00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:23,560
iframe that's an example that's what the

00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:26,410
module is doing right here I in in

00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:29,830
complex big websites there could be

00:38:26,410 --> 00:38:32,650
situations where we have to you know get

00:38:29,830 --> 00:38:34,600
the input in certain set of certain data

00:38:32,650 --> 00:38:36,490
and you have to operate it in a

00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:38,830
different way using that data and you

00:38:36,490 --> 00:38:40,870
overwrite that field and you'll only be

00:38:38,830 --> 00:38:45,310
able to do that you know using a custom

00:38:40,870 --> 00:38:49,810
template or you can also you can also

00:38:45,310 --> 00:38:52,180
custom template forms by default what

00:38:49,810 --> 00:38:54,850
the foam is rendering is much different

00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:57,310
than what you're designing gives you

00:38:54,850 --> 00:38:59,080
then you have 20 variety p forms and you

00:38:57,310 --> 00:39:01,450
can also write the piece you're you can

00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:04,300
override a lot of things in Drupal you

00:39:01,450 --> 00:39:06,820
can override a lot of modules if you

00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:08,410
want to really see you can go to the

00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:10,510
views module or you can go to the blocks

00:39:08,410 --> 00:39:12,100
module and you can see they have their

00:39:10,510 --> 00:39:14,170
own templates and you can copy them to

00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:17,880
your into your team and you can start

00:39:14,170 --> 00:39:17,880
over right they have very good

00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:30,250
documentation so for customizing Drupal

00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:33,130
what you need to learn is use hooks so

00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:37,660
hooks and roopa provide functionality to

00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:47,980
you know access our Drupal object or

00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:54,880
contributed modules and I'm not really

00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:57,040
sure what excuse me so for customizing

00:39:54,880 --> 00:40:00,040
Drupal the other things you can

00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:02,260
I customized in Drupal is you can

00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:06,610
optimize views you can you can set

00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:10,330
custom text formats you know YouTube one

00:40:06,610 --> 00:40:14,020
was one example so it was a custom text

00:40:10,330 --> 00:40:15,730
format that I just own you know output

00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:18,280
in the front end you can also create

00:40:15,730 --> 00:40:20,200
their own types of custom text formats

00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:23,380
I've been done that several times in our

00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:28,300
projects so our I'll give you an example

00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:34,180
in a certain project we had the the

00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:38,080
admin insert a Marketo form ID and if we

00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:40,600
use that market or form ID to render a

00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:44,490
market of form on the front end so this

00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:48,370
is one example of custom text format and

00:40:44,490 --> 00:40:49,960
for big websites you when they have

00:40:48,370 --> 00:40:51,940
those kind of functionalities you need

00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:56,890
to do that and the other thing you can

00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:59,650
do is customize your editor it's really

00:40:56,890 --> 00:41:01,060
important it's it's what the admin uses

00:40:59,650 --> 00:41:05,790
all the time and you want to make that

00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:10,540
as friendly as possible and we try to

00:41:05,790 --> 00:41:13,030
make it look as if you know like the

00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:18,010
front end I'll show you an example

00:41:13,030 --> 00:41:21,030
shortly and it's one of the examples

00:41:18,010 --> 00:41:24,850
that I have so you have the examples of

00:41:21,030 --> 00:41:29,530
three websites are not I'm not calling

00:41:24,850 --> 00:41:31,690
you know small medium or large websites

00:41:29,530 --> 00:41:38,350
there are combination of all those three

00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:44,110
but let's get into it so this is into

00:41:38,350 --> 00:41:51,810
West calm on this is a our website that

00:41:44,110 --> 00:41:56,350
we built in I think 2011 in 2011 and

00:41:51,810 --> 00:42:04,990
this has a really nice layout clean

00:41:56,350 --> 00:42:10,530
clean layout and we use the pace manager

00:42:04,990 --> 00:42:10,530
module a lot and panels and views

00:42:10,570 --> 00:42:18,580
the way we did it was we use the base

00:42:13,570 --> 00:42:22,930
manager for layout and because this had

00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:26,830
a fairly complex layout in different

00:42:22,930 --> 00:42:32,130
pages base manager allowed us to create

00:42:26,830 --> 00:42:34,690
those layout fast here's one example

00:42:32,130 --> 00:42:37,780
it's one of the content type for

00:42:34,690 --> 00:42:41,170
partners you can see a lot of things

00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:43,180
happening on this page there's a large

00:42:41,170 --> 00:42:46,090
blocks on the left hand side on the

00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:50,770
bottom when you click on one of them you

00:42:46,090 --> 00:42:58,060
get were so the news the perspectives

00:42:50,770 --> 00:42:59,800
and on the top right you have the tabs

00:42:58,060 --> 00:43:01,570
going on on the left-hand side you have

00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:05,920
a menu so this is a fairly complex

00:43:01,570 --> 00:43:11,110
layout and we used a biggest manager for

00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:13,630
doing this layout so the challenges we

00:43:11,110 --> 00:43:19,750
faced was there was an absurd amount of

00:43:13,630 --> 00:43:22,630
markup and we didn't really have random

00:43:19,750 --> 00:43:24,400
control over the layout you know it's

00:43:22,630 --> 00:43:28,210
not really great the pay's manager is

00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:29,920
not really great the complex layout so

00:43:28,210 --> 00:43:33,160
that's that's one of the biggest

00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:36,270
challenges we faced but it did allow us

00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:41,110
to create those layouts which is nice um

00:43:36,270 --> 00:43:43,290
here's another example it's it's it's

00:43:41,110 --> 00:43:46,600
one of the recent sites with it and it's

00:43:43,290 --> 00:43:48,670
for the glorious restaurant which is

00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:54,550
really big and takes it it has 15

00:43:48,670 --> 00:43:56,890
locations it's a nice website and we use

00:43:54,550 --> 00:43:58,810
this module we have trying to use as

00:43:56,890 --> 00:44:02,670
less modules as possible on this website

00:43:58,810 --> 00:44:06,850
we used views we used a display sweet

00:44:02,670 --> 00:44:09,430
and some other small modules the

00:44:06,850 --> 00:44:13,810
implementation was we used template

00:44:09,430 --> 00:44:18,220
files to override all nodes pages blogs

00:44:13,810 --> 00:44:22,630
wave forms etc and we use the display

00:44:18,220 --> 00:44:24,750
suite for the view modes and in Drupal

00:44:22,630 --> 00:44:27,130
the view Mozart

00:44:24,750 --> 00:44:30,670
different modes of displaying the note

00:44:27,130 --> 00:44:33,250
you can have the full display mode you

00:44:30,670 --> 00:44:36,660
can have the teaser mode you can have

00:44:33,250 --> 00:44:42,480
any other mode you wanna describe an

00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:42,480
ambiguous used displacer to render notes

00:44:42,510 --> 00:44:49,990
so here system I think I I know this is

00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:54,190
really a granular but you see a lot of

00:44:49,990 --> 00:44:58,200
happening here we have overrides for

00:44:54,190 --> 00:45:03,550
blogs we have a right for nodes phases

00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:05,560
sometimes even specific nodes and on the

00:45:03,550 --> 00:45:09,490
right side you see me using display

00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:12,460
sweet for rendering in the views this is

00:45:09,490 --> 00:45:17,260
a part of the view we're not using any

00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:22,390
fields and the mark-up that has produced

00:45:17,260 --> 00:45:26,830
was completely in control so so this is

00:45:22,390 --> 00:45:35,170
what we are aiming for end just some

00:45:26,830 --> 00:45:37,270
exam screenshots up the website and the

00:45:35,170 --> 00:45:40,540
designer that produced was quite happy

00:45:37,270 --> 00:45:43,750
that we were able to reproduce and we

00:45:40,540 --> 00:45:49,270
are happy to wear as developers with the

00:45:43,750 --> 00:45:52,000
level of control behalf and sometimes

00:45:49,270 --> 00:45:54,820
when we had to have enough style a

00:45:52,000 --> 00:46:00,099
particular note differently then it was

00:45:54,820 --> 00:46:03,270
really easy and forms and this is this

00:46:00,099 --> 00:46:07,320
is something that we're proud about

00:46:03,270 --> 00:46:12,390
forms you know they can have insane

00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:22,300
layouts and it's really easy using

00:46:12,390 --> 00:46:23,349
overrides Sam I don't like Sam I just

00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:26,950
want to let you know that we have ten

00:46:23,349 --> 00:46:28,390
minutes before we wrap up and that we

00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:30,220
want to take some questions and answers

00:46:28,390 --> 00:46:31,599
at the end so if you guys listening

00:46:30,220 --> 00:46:33,460
right now have any questions please feel

00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:35,260
free to send me something in our

00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:38,819
question box and they'll make sure that

00:46:35,260 --> 00:46:41,859
we have time to do that thanks

00:46:38,819 --> 00:46:46,529
okay um I'll just breeze through this

00:46:41,859 --> 00:46:51,039
last example but just wanna show you one

00:46:46,529 --> 00:46:53,759
this is different visitor this place

00:46:51,039 --> 00:47:00,729
would be used for different few modes

00:46:53,759 --> 00:47:05,039
and some custom layouts that be used the

00:47:00,729 --> 00:47:08,349
backend and how trend is on the function

00:47:05,039 --> 00:47:11,889
and this is the customization we go to

00:47:08,349 --> 00:47:14,529
the editor and would try to reflect what

00:47:11,889 --> 00:47:16,989
the admin would see on the front ends

00:47:14,529 --> 00:47:19,989
though this is what they see in the

00:47:16,989 --> 00:47:21,759
front end I'm really sorry this is going

00:47:19,989 --> 00:47:25,839
real fast but I wish we had more time

00:47:21,759 --> 00:47:28,689
and different views the penalizing will

00:47:25,839 --> 00:47:30,759
do here for different styles or

00:47:28,689 --> 00:47:35,739
different layouts for any content type

00:47:30,759 --> 00:47:37,749
they had more than one content type well

00:47:35,739 --> 00:47:40,389
in this model we used in this project we

00:47:37,749 --> 00:47:42,039
used analyzer because it lets let the

00:47:40,389 --> 00:47:44,739
client have more control they didn't

00:47:42,039 --> 00:47:47,769
have to go to the code now but however

00:47:44,739 --> 00:47:52,389
the challenges was it analyzed a

00:47:47,769 --> 00:47:56,919
producer a lot of markup okay this is

00:47:52,389 --> 00:47:59,789
the end of the webinar I would like to

00:47:56,919 --> 00:48:05,529
end this but the morning workflow we use

00:47:59,789 --> 00:48:07,479
in magic logics the tools that we use or

00:48:05,529 --> 00:48:11,469
get for any project that we use its

00:48:07,479 --> 00:48:14,799
person control we have trust and that is

00:48:11,469 --> 00:48:16,749
the Drupal sale if any of you have not

00:48:14,799 --> 00:48:20,529
used to Drupal cell please consider it

00:48:16,749 --> 00:48:24,339
it's it's very handy and we have local

00:48:20,529 --> 00:48:27,130
lamp stack and the editor of our choices

00:48:24,339 --> 00:48:32,079
sublime text we also use notepad plus

00:48:27,130 --> 00:48:34,659
plus and as developers our choice of

00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:39,279
module system but we we cannot give it

00:48:34,659 --> 00:48:43,149
up develop be used features and examples

00:48:39,279 --> 00:48:46,329
is really a good way of getting into the

00:48:43,149 --> 00:48:49,619
truth'll API there are other models thin

00:48:46,329 --> 00:48:49,619
developer and backup and migrate

00:48:50,860 --> 00:48:55,710
and the modern workflow is once you have

00:48:53,410 --> 00:48:58,480
your site ready you have set up the get

00:48:55,710 --> 00:49:03,070
you basically start by pulling up

00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:05,820
pulling code from the depository you

00:49:03,070 --> 00:49:07,960
update your Drupal core and the modules

00:49:05,820 --> 00:49:12,520
you make whatever changes you need to

00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:15,580
make locally are you test it and your

00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:19,720
prove it you push the code to the dev

00:49:15,580 --> 00:49:22,210
server and you test that also test and

00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:24,690
approve and finally once everything is

00:49:22,210 --> 00:49:29,760
tested you push the code to production

00:49:24,690 --> 00:49:31,990
this is just one one of our workflows

00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:34,240
there could be slight modification if

00:49:31,990 --> 00:49:38,470
you have more than one developer and you

00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:41,590
have a test server but for any modern

00:49:38,470 --> 00:49:45,520
workflow I'd recommend at list using get

00:49:41,590 --> 00:49:48,880
at least using dress and at least ass

00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:53,620
teasing are developing server besides

00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:55,840
the production cool thank you yeah

00:49:53,620 --> 00:49:58,960
thanks Bess um I guess we'll see if

00:49:55,840 --> 00:50:00,940
Lauren has any questions as you can see

00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:02,500
Sam will probably answer them I'm kind

00:50:00,940 --> 00:50:06,850
of the color commentator needs to play

00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:09,370
by play guys are great thank you so much

00:50:06,850 --> 00:50:11,440
for your time it looks like we don't

00:50:09,370 --> 00:50:14,950
have any questions I have a quick

00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:18,460
question Sam where would you recommend

00:50:14,950 --> 00:50:20,380
to follow up on kind of where you

00:50:18,460 --> 00:50:22,270
started as an introduction but where

00:50:20,380 --> 00:50:26,350
where could you find some resources to

00:50:22,270 --> 00:50:28,210
really hone in on these skills that's

00:50:26,350 --> 00:50:31,360
what question I had the same question

00:50:28,210 --> 00:50:36,010
myself a lot of times I basically

00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:40,450
started you know in drupal org itself or

00:50:36,010 --> 00:50:45,130
meet material but accident developer you

00:50:40,450 --> 00:50:48,670
have to you know make mistakes and learn

00:50:45,130 --> 00:50:51,940
from your past you get you get better as

00:50:48,670 --> 00:50:56,020
a new more project right and for actual

00:50:51,940 --> 00:50:59,890
nope being a great content I follow a

00:50:56,020 --> 00:51:01,480
lot of good big blocks out there a lot

00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:04,000
of companies doing Drupal

00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:07,600
you're really planning to start our

00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:10,210
vlogs past so you can look forward to

00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:15,760
getting great content from mathematics

00:51:10,210 --> 00:51:17,440
and I can say perfect um and you know

00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:20,500
other than next steps is there anything

00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:24,220
really quickly you wanted to add 2 to

00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:27,750
our participants on how to either

00:51:24,220 --> 00:51:30,940
explore any best tips or practices for

00:51:27,750 --> 00:51:34,690
you know triple triple sites and really

00:51:30,940 --> 00:51:36,850
how to get started with that I do have

00:51:34,690 --> 00:51:39,520
one one one thing I want to comment yes

00:51:36,850 --> 00:51:44,050
really need at community in Drupal be

00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:47,170
really need a lot of no web developing

00:51:44,050 --> 00:51:49,960
agencies come out and you know if it's

00:51:47,170 --> 00:51:51,820
possible give up your approach to Drupal

00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:55,060
development we can learn from each other

00:51:51,820 --> 00:51:57,460
this is what magic Latics does and will

00:51:55,060 --> 00:51:59,770
definitely be improving on this one what

00:51:57,460 --> 00:52:02,530
we really like to see how other agencies

00:51:59,770 --> 00:52:05,020
approach their development the choices

00:52:02,530 --> 00:52:08,800
of module ivory Latta blogs and other

00:52:05,020 --> 00:52:11,580
companies and it has helped me and my

00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:16,570
developers you know improve their skills

00:52:11,580 --> 00:52:19,780
so like we have you know Drupal so cases

00:52:16,570 --> 00:52:22,690
we could we could add you know drupal

00:52:19,780 --> 00:52:25,000
you know to developer focused on so

00:52:22,690 --> 00:52:28,720
cases and we have detailed case studies

00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:30,130
that would be nice that's awesome and we

00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:33,660
did have a couple questions come in

00:52:30,130 --> 00:52:37,390
really quick one from one of our

00:52:33,660 --> 00:52:42,600
participants says I just ran spring CM

00:52:37,390 --> 00:52:45,010
calm under the built with comm site

00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:48,400
there's a lot of other stuff running do

00:52:45,010 --> 00:52:51,670
you have any comments on that you'd be

00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:55,570
back please I think quickly sure it's as

00:52:51,670 --> 00:52:58,720
I just ran spring CM calm under the

00:52:55,570 --> 00:53:01,030
built with comm site a lot of other

00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:03,550
stuff running do you have any comments

00:53:01,030 --> 00:53:05,500
about that there's a lot of JavaScript

00:53:03,550 --> 00:53:09,180
running I'll give you that I'm just a

00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:10,840
lot of marque dos stuff happening a

00:53:09,180 --> 00:53:16,180
social

00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:18,100
and obviously Google Analytics I mean

00:53:16,180 --> 00:53:23,130
there's a lot of other modules that we

00:53:18,100 --> 00:53:25,900
using but we're real quick I think I

00:53:23,130 --> 00:53:28,120
didn't quite understand if you could you

00:53:25,900 --> 00:53:30,330
could say what other those other things

00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:34,300
are running I could give a better answer

00:53:30,330 --> 00:53:35,830
okay um I'll let him respond and then

00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:38,530
I'll take another question really suck

00:53:35,830 --> 00:53:42,670
not to you know hear feedback you can

00:53:38,530 --> 00:53:45,640
directly email us at info at magic

00:53:42,670 --> 00:53:47,830
logics com although i personally know st

00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:51,280
la cena at night ecological calm and I'm

00:53:47,830 --> 00:53:53,080
really happy to respond great so just to

00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:54,910
make sure everyone I heard it's on the

00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:57,430
slide actually right now you're more

00:53:54,910 --> 00:53:59,500
than welcome to email Sam at info at

00:53:57,430 --> 00:54:03,070
magic logics calm and I would just put

00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:04,660
question for Sam in the subject line and

00:54:03,070 --> 00:54:06,760
then I'm sure could get forwarded to him

00:54:04,660 --> 00:54:10,750
Sam I have one last question really

00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:13,510
quick is there a public test server that

00:54:10,750 --> 00:54:18,850
I can point in under development drupal

00:54:13,510 --> 00:54:21,490
site come again is there a public test

00:54:18,850 --> 00:54:24,250
server that someone can point in under

00:54:21,490 --> 00:54:26,920
development drupal site so like i'm

00:54:24,250 --> 00:54:30,310
assuming a staging site yes i think you

00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:33,390
can use pantheon if you've heard about

00:54:30,310 --> 00:54:36,940
it they let you you know but developers

00:54:33,390 --> 00:54:39,910
develop sites there / cream that's

00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:44,680
that's when that one is you want might

00:54:39,910 --> 00:54:46,960
want to look okay great um so I think

00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:48,910
that covers our questions and answers
