keep a look out there and with that

00:03:54,769 --> 00:04:00,079

00:03:57,299 --> 00:04:00,079

00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:21,370
to that question section but Mike it

00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:23,050
looks like we might need to kick off

00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:29,830
which you might actually have to go

00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:35,830
first despite despite our assurances

00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:38,020

00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:40,030

00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:35,110
everyone here today so that we can cover

00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:38,500
some really important stuff that the DA

00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:41,050
does to support the Drupal community so

00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:42,910
you know the association here in the

00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:45,669
States was formed just a couple of years

00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:48,490
ago with the mission of supporting the

00:05:45,669 --> 00:05:51,419
growth of the community and the Drupal

00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:54,039
project we do that in a number of ways

00:05:51,419 --> 00:05:56,470
part of that of course is maintaining

00:05:54,039 --> 00:05:59,289
drupal org and all the work that we do

00:05:56,470 --> 00:06:01,030
to support that site but it's not just

00:05:59,289 --> 00:06:03,450
the site it's also the support the

00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:06,729
community that we want to support and so

00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:10,630
we've instituted a variety of programs

00:06:06,729 --> 00:06:12,670
here including global training days our

00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:16,930

00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:21,730

00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:23,710
you'll see us roll out over the coming

00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:25,270
months as well but today we wanted to

00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:26,440
talk about what we already do and make

00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:29,380
sure that the community can take

00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:31,120
advantage of all that it has to offer so

00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:34,240
we've got for community members to talk

00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:36,940

00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:37,270
you all for joining us today this is

00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:41,710
very exciting it's my first ever webinar

00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:44,200
so I'm very excited about about it yeah

00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:46,510
we at the drupal association are very

00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:49,300
you know very much about building

00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:53,260
programs that support and grow the

00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:55,990
Drupal community and part of that is

00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:58,360
that we want to help grow the community

00:07:55,990 --> 00:08:00,970
around the world so in order to do that

00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:03,970
it's the people on the ground in their

00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:07,180
communities who know best what needs to

00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:10,630
be done so we want to help make that a

00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:13,600
reality so the program that we offer to

00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:16,510
help with that is one of them is the

00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:18,550
community cultivation grants and these

00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:22,390
grants can be used for a wide variety of

00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:26,409
things and here to talk about some of

00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:29,649
those things is Mike anhelo VP

00:08:26,409 --> 00:08:34,629
of drupal easy and one of our community

00:08:29,649 --> 00:08:37,389
leaders from Florida so Mike if you

00:08:34,629 --> 00:08:40,389
would like to take it away we'll talk

00:08:37,389 --> 00:08:43,930
about community cultivation grants sure

00:08:40,389 --> 00:08:45,639
well thank you very much um I've never

00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:47,589
I've never actually seen myself with a

00:08:45,639 --> 00:08:49,689
title of community leader so thank you

00:08:47,589 --> 00:08:53,250
for that i might start using that I'm my

00:08:49,689 --> 00:08:56,339
business card now but um yeah so I'm

00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:58,930
it's enough to ask me to talk about um

00:08:56,339 --> 00:09:00,879
community cultivation grants and this is

00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:03,040
a small there's actually three of us on

00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:06,279
this committee it's myself and a nice

00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:09,490
car vada and Thomas terrible so I'm

00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:10,959
going to refer to us as we when I'm when

00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:13,269
I'm talking about community cultivation

00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:15,160
grants and it's pretty much an equal

00:09:13,269 --> 00:09:19,149
distribution of work among the three of

00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:21,430
us um and I look at it as we have the

00:09:19,149 --> 00:09:24,009
the best volunteer job in the world

00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:28,149
where our jobs to basically give away

00:09:24,009 --> 00:09:31,420
money the DA provides us with a budget

00:09:28,149 --> 00:09:35,110
every year and you know basically says

00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:37,750
you use this money to help grow the

00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:39,759
Drupal community and we do that by

00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:43,389
providing these community cultivation

00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:45,430
and grants and after heart we always in

00:09:43,389 --> 00:09:47,920
whatever we get an application a grant

00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:50,740
application we always ask ourselves you

00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:53,680
know a couple of questions and the first

00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:58,060
and foremost being will this project

00:09:53,680 --> 00:10:00,100
help grow the Drupal community we feel

00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:03,730
that's kind of our mission is to support

00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:06,670
the growth of the community so that's

00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:09,759
usually the first thing that we ask we

00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:13,240
have an ongoing grant cycle meaning it

00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:15,819
never closes as of right now so if you

00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:17,980
have an idea for some type of community

00:10:15,819 --> 00:10:20,680
project that you would like to get some

00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:23,500
startup funding for I would definitely

00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:27,639
encourage you to you know come to

00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:30,910
association drupal.org / grants this is

00:10:27,639 --> 00:10:32,829
the page at you'll see has a lot of good

00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:36,370
information about the types of things

00:10:32,829 --> 00:10:39,520
that we know we're looking to fund a

00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:42,220
link to the application as well

00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:44,260
um which I'll talk about the application

00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:46,750
in a second but this page is kind of

00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:49,240
like the home the home base for who we

00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:50,650
are what we do and probably most

00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:52,750
importantly what have we funded in the

00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:54,730
past is that is probably a pretty good

00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:56,500
indicator the types of things that you

00:10:54,730 --> 00:11:01,740
know we'd be willing to fund in the

00:10:56,500 --> 00:11:05,200
future um a couple of of the past

00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:07,210
projects that we funded recently I it's

00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:10,090
one of just to give you an idea of kind

00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:12,310
of what we've done recently is we

00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:14,890
actually funded these are not we're not

00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:16,720
funding the full amount we basically

00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:20,260
look at it is we are providing a

00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:22,150
kickstart money um you know and a lot of

00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:24,790
times a lot of the projects come to us

00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:26,830
are for first time camps you know so if

00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:29,500
you're in a geographic area that doesn't

00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:31,420
have an existing drupalcamp it might be

00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:32,800
difficult to get that first camp up and

00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:34,660
going especially if you have to you know

00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:37,470
put out money for a venue or put out

00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:40,530
money for t-shirts or some marketing um

00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:42,490
if if you haven't had a cat before

00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:47,080
sponsors are usually a little bit more

00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:48,340
leery about sending you money so that's

00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:49,990
where we come in to kind of say okay

00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:51,910
well we'll front you the initial money

00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:53,110
you know it's probably not going to be a

00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:56,350
hundred percent of everything that you

00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:58,690
need but it's going to get you going I'm

00:11:56,350 --> 00:12:01,090
a great example of this is drupalcamp

00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:05,130
China which took place earlier this year

00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:08,650
in March arm you know one of the

00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:10,330
organizers basically filled out an

00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:11,980
application and said hey look we're

00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:15,640
looking to have the first mainland China

00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:17,710
drupalcamp here's our plan here's our

00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:20,500
budget here's what we're looking to do

00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:22,690
here's how many people we are looking to

00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:24,400
impact I should probably say that's

00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:27,970
another thing that we actually look at

00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:32,110
is um when people are asking for X

00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:34,840
number of dollars we also look at how

00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:36,730
many people will that you know how many

00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:38,290
people that actually impact so we

00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:42,220
actually you know sometimes we break it

00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:45,510
down into now we're paying X dollars for

00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:47,730
you know the per person

00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:51,330
um that gives us a little bit of a

00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:53,220
sanity check but drupalcamp china was it

00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:55,080
was a great example of the exact type of

00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:56,820
project that we're looking to support it

00:12:55,080 --> 00:13:00,450
was a first-time camp they need some

00:12:56,820 --> 00:13:04,440
money to kind of get the word out um do

00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:06,630
a little bit of marketing I think for

00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:08,940
producing t-shirts things like that and

00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:10,650
they when they came to us they said well

00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:14,130
we're going to piggyback and on a bar

00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:15,810
camp style event so I'm just talking to

00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:19,050
people they were expecting to get

00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:21,690
somewhere between 50 and 100 people and

00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:23,550
when it turned out you know at the end

00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:25,110
of it because it was a larger of our

00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:29,280
camp type event they were able to draw

00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:31,560
more people than they saw and for the

00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:34,620
drupal only sessions they had over 300

00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:38,490
people attend and they had somewhere

00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:41,310
between 150 and 200 people attend the

00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:43,470
drupal keynote as well I actually think

00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:45,660
part of the grant also went towards

00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:48,780
flying in a speaker for their keynote

00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:52,680
well so this was a great example of an

00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:54,480
event that was a first time camp and

00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:56,520
they just needed a little bit of help to

00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:59,940
get started oh and start getting

00:13:56,520 --> 00:14:01,800
exposure and we fully expect that you

00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:05,610
know drupalcamp China and other similar

00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:08,130
events you know once they have their

00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:10,320
first event and get some exposure next

00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:12,450
year if they try and run the same event

00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:16,680
it'll be a lot easier to find sponsors

00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:19,380
um so that's the first one I wanted to

00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:23,130
mention the other one I wanted to

00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:25,830
mention was the campus tours in the

00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:27,360
Philippines this one I wanted to mention

00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:30,180
because it wasn't for specifically a

00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,440
drupalcamp I don't really have any

00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:33,930
numbers in front of me but I would

00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:36,810
somewhere over half maybe half to

00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:39,560
three-quarters of all of our projects

00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:43,400
that we fund tend to be first time camps

00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:47,300
but we're always looking for unique

00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:50,190
projects on that are necessary

00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:54,420
verily camps we think that's where um

00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:55,860
there's a lot of opportunity for people

00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:57,540
to kind of come up with ways for people

00:14:55,860 --> 00:15:01,050
to grow the community in different ways

00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:04,590
I know a year maybe a year ago we funded

00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:06,540
I believe it was a a group in South

00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:10,350
America it may have been Central America

00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:14,040
that wanted to put together a short

00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:15,780
Drupal magazine to distribute to central

00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:19,290
and south america in primarily

00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:21,270
spanish-speaking countries and we looked

00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:22,650
at how much they were asking for and how

00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:24,330
many people was going to reach and it

00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:26,520
turned into a no-brainer for us it was

00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:29,190
no there was a tremendous amount of

00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:33,990
people exposed Drupal for a very small

00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:35,370
investment in our part um so the second

00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:37,920
one a lot of dimension I guess the third

00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:39,660
one now since I've gone off my my plan

00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:42,450
and talked about the magazine one but

00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:44,280
the next one is the Philippine campus

00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:47,820
tours and this wasn't specifically a

00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:51,240
drupalcamp this was a number of half day

00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:52,860
events where the organizer and several

00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:55,080
other people basically traveled around

00:15:52,860 --> 00:16:00,090
the country to different universities

00:15:55,080 --> 00:16:02,190
and put on a full day event it was

00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:04,740
basically a half-day seminar and a half

00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:05,720
day a drupal tutorial and they went

00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:09,570
around to different universities

00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:12,210
exposing students to drupal we felt this

00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:13,590
was an outstanding event it was a

00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:17,700
first-time event and they basically

00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:19,290
needed some rolling um since then I

00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:21,000
think they're looking at doing a second

00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:24,620
round of this and they already have a

00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:28,500
number of sponsors lined up so hopefully

00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:33,210
we won't they won't be needing these

00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:34,950
community cultivation funds again and

00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:37,140
this is the exactly the type of stuff we

00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:39,450
want to see where we help get you

00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:42,510
rolling you can get the exposure and

00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:45,720
then find sponsors or find some way to

00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:48,560
make a sustainable moving forward a lot

00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:52,380
of times with applications that we get

00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:55,560
and people are requesting funds were a

00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:58,350
lot of times we start conversations with

00:16:55,560 --> 00:17:00,250
them and the question that we tend to

00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:01,120
ask more often than not is

00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:03,130
how are you going to make this

00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,230
sustainable next year you know how are

00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:07,060
you going to pull this event off you

00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:11,260
know in the future without you know

00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:12,520
another community cultivation grant so a

00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:14,439
lot of times we're looking for that

00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:18,760
information actually in the application

00:17:14,439 --> 00:17:20,920
I guess I'm not keeping track of time so

00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:24,209
I'm going to talk just for a few more

00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:26,470
minutes on the application process and

00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:28,840
Stephanie feel free to give me the high

00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:32,710
sign if I need to stop talking no that

00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:34,330
sounds great ok so the application

00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:36,580
process we try to make it as simple as

00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:38,260
possible it's not a long drawn-out

00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:40,570
application we don't want people

00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:41,980
spending hours and hours completing an

00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:44,530
application to apply for one of these

00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:49,200
grants so while the application is is

00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:51,730
short we are looking for specific Saints

00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:54,240
and number number one we want to make

00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:58,240
sure that there's a sound plan in place

00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:59,980
that you know we feel that applying for

00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:03,670
a community cultivation grant shouldn't

00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:06,670
be your first stop of the planning cycle

00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:08,440
it should be near the end where you know

00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:10,090
you basically have your budget laid out

00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:12,550
you know about how much money you're

00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:13,990
going to spend you know about how much

00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:17,860
money you're going to be able to take in

00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:20,940
and there's a gap and that gap is where

00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:23,440
we feel that we could fit in the best um

00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:25,090
so if you're interested in submitting an

00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:27,310
application for a community cultivation

00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:31,090
grant i encourage you to basically you

00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:34,510
know do your homework in terms of

00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:36,640
organizing the event um just like you

00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:38,080
would you know you would plan out any

00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:40,510
event with or without a community

00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:43,780
cultivation grant you know have a strong

00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:45,760
organizing team have a plan in place as

00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:47,830
far as how many people and where it's

00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:50,920
going to be and the type of marketing

00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:52,870
you're going to need put together um you

00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:54,550
know a simple budget and we actually you

00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:58,690
know for people who ask we actually have

00:18:54,550 --> 00:19:00,820
a a simple budget in a Google Doc that

00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:02,080
we share with people if you know just so

00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:05,290
they have an idea of what we're looking

00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:07,510
for um you know kind of try and get as

00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:11,200
many of your ducks in a row and if you

00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:12,850
feel that you know your project you know

00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,830
isn't going to happen without kind of a

00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:16,080
little bit of a kick start

00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:20,820
then that's exactly where we want to

00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:24,480
come in and help you out um so I think

00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:27,090
that is about all I had planned to talk

00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:29,100
about I'm more than happy to take

00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:31,559
questions now or I'll you know I'll hang

00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:33,090
out for the rest of the webinar if

00:19:31,559 --> 00:19:36,750
anybody thinks of any questions in a few

00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:42,779
minutes well thank you so much Michael

00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:49,769

do we have any questions for Mike uh you

00:19:49,769 --> 00:19:55,049
know oddly Megan can see the questions

00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:58,230
that I cannot okay Megan says nothing

00:19:55,049 --> 00:20:00,179
content related so far okay ah I think

00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:01,950
we're good but Mike see I just thinking

00:20:00,179 --> 00:20:04,710
you know we're like the venture you're

00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:06,630
like the venture philanthropist after

00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:08,220
all that's a great adventurer

00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:10,320
philanthropist I like that's the best

00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:11,700
it's the best volunteer together I'm

00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:37,710
you guys do it we sure are so I'm

00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:43,860
thinking now I carry and is drew on do

00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:47,460
we know yes yes Oh wonderful wonderful

00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:53,549
well why don't we move now to talk a

00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:55,409
little bit about fiscal sponsorship so

00:20:53,549 --> 00:20:58,500
folks one of the you know most

00:20:55,409 --> 00:21:02,309
challenging aspects to starting an event

00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:05,779
as as many of you know is having support

00:21:02,309 --> 00:21:09,480
for managing your payments and invoices

00:21:05,779 --> 00:21:12,059
so currently we at the drupal

00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:16,019
association have a program in the united

00:21:12,059 --> 00:21:19,320
states just a side note we are looking

00:21:16,019 --> 00:21:23,250
to expand to europe in 2014 and then

00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:27,140
beyond after that but this program

00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:30,080
provides administrative support

00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:34,460
in other words you could get your grant

00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:36,800
from Mike and put it in the bank with

00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:40,130
the DA with the drupal association and

00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:44,930
then pay your people through this

00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:46,720
account so that's kind of the the nuts

00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:51,320
and bolts of it and so here to discuss

00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:53,120
fiscal sponsorships we have Gary say

00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:56,990
your last name again you it's such a

00:21:53,120 --> 00:22:02,180
great last name hey it's Pepe carry

00:21:56,990 --> 00:22:06,710
company I love it and drew Gorton Drupal

00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:12,110
leaders from Minnesota and I'm going to

00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:18,530
turn it over to you folks and I'm good

00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:20,720
I'll just I'll start so we we use the

00:22:18,530 --> 00:22:23,240
drupal association as the fiscal sponsor

00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:26,230
for camp and you know the bottom line is

00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:30,980
that made that the fiscal sponsorship

00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:34,220
really made the administration work much

00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:37,880
easier and allowed us to focus on the

00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:39,620
mission of the camp which was getting

00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:41,960
additional great sessions and and

00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:45,200
recruiting people to attend and to speak

00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:46,940
and and taking good care of sponsors and

00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,500
and actually you know one of the things

00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:51,260
we did that went really well with this

00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:54,040
year was expand into a bigger venue and

00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:57,980
you know just it it overall really

00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:59,960
really took the the the atmosphere the

00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:04,670
the tenor of the camp up a up a notch

00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:10,220
that that folks really appreciated on

00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:12,950
the mechanics side of things we we had

00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:14,900
all of our sponsors well norstar website

00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:18,770
all of the payments through float

00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:21,260
through our website and course only to

00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:24,230
the to the DA through their their PayPal

00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:26,930
PayPal account so that actually meant

00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:30,260
that most of our sponsors and camp

00:23:26,930 --> 00:23:34,490
participants made all of their payments

00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:37,220
online for the few who had some issues

00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:39,900
with with that process it was it was

00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:42,780
great because the association staff

00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:47,010
were there and helpful and just picked

00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:48,390
up with folks as as necessary and we

00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:50,490
were really able to pretty quickly

00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:54,540
resolve any hiccups in the in the

00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:57,020
payment process for folks yeah it's a

00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:59,090
really awesome service too because

00:23:57,020 --> 00:24:01,950
anybody's organized a camp before

00:23:59,090 --> 00:24:04,530
certainly you realize wow it's a lot of

00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:06,570
work you have no idea I we've done it

00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:08,340
now several years but the first year and

00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:10,170
each year thereafter actually you

00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:13,170
realize wow there's just so much to be

00:24:10,170 --> 00:24:16,110
done and to be able to offload the

00:24:13,170 --> 00:24:17,850
accounting and the accountability to a

00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:19,440
third-party organization that has

00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:21,210
transparency that has professional

00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:23,460
accounting professional auditing and all

00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:26,370
those kinds of things is a tremendous

00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:29,040
thing not only is it easier for us as a

00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:31,110
camp to you know not have to deal with

00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:33,360
that whole set of things but I also

00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:34,890
think there's something I think this I

00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:36,930
think is inherently better anytime

00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:39,900
you're dealing with with funds and

00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:43,800
sponsor funds and all those things is

00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:46,320
there's always the risk of impropriety

00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:50,040
or you know concerns around that and to

00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:54,420
have the DA and and the accounting folks

00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:58,650
there actually managing all of the money

00:24:54,420 --> 00:25:00,840
sending us regular reports and being you

00:24:58,650 --> 00:25:03,060
know that third that that other party

00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:04,350
that's checking with us and making sure

00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:05,880
that funds are being spent wisely and

00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:06,990
that anyone can feel like anyone on the

00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:08,670
planning committee can check those

00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:11,610
things I think it's just tremendously

00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:14,970
valuable and again from the camp

00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:16,890
perspective it's just great to not have

00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:19,110
to worry about that and to have the

00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:23,220
ability for payments for example to go

00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:25,650
to a non-profit and and there is and the

00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:29,340
DA does charge a fee for that but i

00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:32,370
think it's awfully nominal and entirely

00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:36,690
worth it and and frankly going to a good

00:25:32,370 --> 00:25:39,690
cause in my opinion yeah I deco that we

00:25:36,690 --> 00:25:42,180
got reports every two weeks from the the

00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:45,570
DA with the statement showing all the

00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:47,870
activity for the for the camp and I was

00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:50,460
it was just so easy to take that data

00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:52,830
transfer it to my budget spreadsheet and

00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:53,810
really track where we were going with

00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:56,270
the camp

00:25:53,810 --> 00:25:58,010
it was yeah it was great because I

00:25:56,270 --> 00:26:01,160
always had really good numbers to put in

00:25:58,010 --> 00:26:04,460
front of folks whenever I needed to be

00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:07,100
able to do that and again it just gets

00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:09,590
back to really letting us as volunteers

00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:12,770
focus on the core mission kind of work

00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:16,070
that we should be doing with camp right

00:26:12,770 --> 00:26:19,580
that is that is fantastic you guys

00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:22,000
that's very exciting and and um we're so

00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:27,320
glad that you're able to utilize this

00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:32,030
this benefit that's fantastic are there

00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:40,610
any questions for Kerry or drew about

00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:42,380
fiscal sponsorship this is this holly i

00:26:40,610 --> 00:26:44,180
just wanted to start by saying Kerry and

00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:46,040
drew um tell us a little bit about how

00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:49,430
this year what are you guys as camp

00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:53,540
organizers how the character now best

00:26:49,430 --> 00:26:55,220
ever you know yeah it was if it's really

00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:58,370
awesome and actually i'll say this

00:26:55,220 --> 00:27:02,110
seriously we've had um we've had a

00:26:58,370 --> 00:27:04,580
number of good camps and and I think we

00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:05,630
benefit from having a pretty good you

00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:07,130
know like a lot of people come to our

00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:08,630
camp say oh this is a really great camp

00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:11,780
and you know we hear that from people

00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:15,080
who go to a lot of camps and this year

00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:18,200
we you know broke all records in terms

00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:21,170
of sessions and attendees and sponsors

00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:24,320
and everything number of people like it

00:27:21,170 --> 00:27:26,600
was it was fantastic and I want to give

00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:28,610
big props to carry because she is the

00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:30,530
every year we've had a different person

00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:32,450
organizing the camp and as our lead

00:27:30,530 --> 00:27:35,750
project manager or chief cat herder of a

00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:38,600
bunch of volunteers and she really got

00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:41,240
us all moving quickly and managed to do

00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:44,720
that and so carried is absolutely

00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:46,610
fantastic job oh thanks thanks drew um

00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:49,900
you know we had a great group of

00:27:46,610 --> 00:27:52,250
volunteers including drew that that um

00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:55,610
just kept their eyes on the prize and

00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:57,200
and the energy it's just tremendously

00:27:55,610 --> 00:27:59,090
get we've got great energy and I do

00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:02,930
think we just keep building on it each

00:27:59,090 --> 00:28:05,360
year and again I what helps is having

00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:06,980
that underlying structure from the DA in

00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:08,230
place to support our work it's

00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:12,170
tremendous

00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:15,340
and what was the process like to to get

00:28:12,170 --> 00:28:20,390
that set up with the drupal association

00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:23,210
you know we did that initially i think

00:28:20,390 --> 00:28:26,210
it was but we did it the starting three

00:28:23,210 --> 00:28:27,770
years ago i think and it basically just

00:28:26,210 --> 00:28:29,300
started with a question because we were

00:28:27,770 --> 00:28:30,950
starting to wonder ourselves how to do

00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:33,680
because certainly there are a lot of

00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:36,890
companies involved in the drupal space

00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:38,840
in the Twin Cities my company is one of

00:28:36,890 --> 00:28:41,120
them but but it didn't quite feel right

00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:42,530
to say you know we're going to run it

00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:44,720
through our accounting that just didn't

00:28:42,530 --> 00:28:45,860
feel right at all and likewise I don't

00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:48,980
think anybody else was eager for that

00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:51,410
sort of thing that's just and so we

00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:56,240
reached out to the DA and said look is a

00:28:51,410 --> 00:28:58,220
way for the DA to be involved in and you

00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:00,560
know offering this service or I think

00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:02,090
maybe I don't remember the exact

00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:03,710
questions but and we might have just

00:29:02,090 --> 00:29:06,440
said like what do you what other people

00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:08,810
do and I think it was early early as an

00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:11,120
idea at that point and someone said here

00:29:08,810 --> 00:29:14,570
how about we try this and we've stuck

00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:16,610
with it ever since and I think it's

00:29:14,570 --> 00:29:19,490
again I'm a huge fan I think it's an

00:29:16,610 --> 00:29:22,220
absolutely fantastic option for camps

00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:23,690
and it's really a no-brainer I don't if

00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:25,490
you're doing a camp you should

00:29:23,690 --> 00:29:27,140
definitely do this it just takes care of

00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:29,780
so much stuff it also adds just a layer

00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:34,340
of transparency auditing that's just um

00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:36,790
really good yeah yeah it having really

00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:40,010
an independent person as your accountant

00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:43,130
just keeps things very very clean and it

00:29:40,010 --> 00:29:46,010
was as in terms of reimbursements it was

00:29:43,130 --> 00:29:48,380
great to just be able to forward the

00:29:46,010 --> 00:29:50,960
forms and instructions that I received

00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:53,240
from Chris forwarded all of that

00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:55,840
information on to volunteers who need to

00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:59,510
be reimbursed with things for things and

00:29:55,840 --> 00:30:01,550
it they sent the information on to her

00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:03,770
and it got taken care of so you know

00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:05,240
aside from checking in and and making

00:30:03,770 --> 00:30:09,320
sure I was letting Chris know that yes

00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:11,990
this is an approved expense again I as a

00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:15,680
project manager was really able to not

00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:18,470
spend my time just managing all of those

00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:20,320
super tiny details super tiny but super

00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:23,889
important details

00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:25,899
and and with that too like as a anyone

00:30:23,889 --> 00:30:27,340
running a camp right you're always by

00:30:25,899 --> 00:30:30,279
definition dealing with a lot of

00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:32,470
volunteers and volunteers always have

00:30:30,279 --> 00:30:34,389
limited amount of time and to be able to

00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:36,789
just write an email and say one of the

00:30:34,389 --> 00:30:39,460
balances or how do we get reimbursements

00:30:36,789 --> 00:30:44,039
and to almost instantly get a response

00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:48,309
back and and I'd like a full spreadsheet

00:30:44,039 --> 00:30:50,590
fantastic yeah yeah especially the days

00:30:48,309 --> 00:30:52,480
just before the camp when we were just

00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:54,940
tracking down we had you know a lot of

00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:57,429
details and dust sitting at about knee

00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:59,889
level and we wanted to get that closer

00:30:57,429 --> 00:31:02,169
to the ground again the responsiveness

00:30:59,889 --> 00:31:06,399
from the foundation was was just amazing

00:31:02,169 --> 00:31:09,600
and spot-on well i will give Chris a hug

00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:09,600
for you when I get that huge crowd

00:31:10,019 --> 00:31:18,759
really okay thanks so much Kerry and

00:31:14,649 --> 00:31:22,929
drew from Minnesota from Drupal camp

00:31:18,759 --> 00:31:28,899
Twin Cities fabulous really appreciate

00:31:22,929 --> 00:31:36,940
it so let's now transition to talk about

00:31:28,899 --> 00:31:39,899
the global training days program part of

00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:43,710
our mission at the drupal association is

00:31:39,899 --> 00:31:46,570
to grow the drupal developer base and

00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:50,169
global training days is an important

00:31:46,570 --> 00:31:53,049
part of making that happen so if you're

00:31:50,169 --> 00:31:55,509
a trainer you can use our global

00:31:53,049 --> 00:31:58,600
training days to help grow the Drupal

00:31:55,509 --> 00:32:03,159
community and maybe even your bottom

00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:05,889
line so here to talk about our global

00:32:03,159 --> 00:32:10,509
training days program is the Drupal

00:32:05,889 --> 00:32:14,710
associations own Ruth fuller so Ruth why

00:32:10,509 --> 00:32:17,379
don't you take it away hi there yes

00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:20,769
Stephanie said the global training days

00:32:17,379 --> 00:32:23,889
is a program that is really built around

00:32:20,769 --> 00:32:27,220
expanding our community it's a free or

00:32:23,889 --> 00:32:29,260
low-cost training events that as main

00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:31,629
goal is really to promote Drupal

00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:34,269
knowledge it started as a board

00:32:31,629 --> 00:32:36,849
initiative and it's really grown

00:32:34,269 --> 00:32:40,869
beyond that from just training companies

00:32:36,849 --> 00:32:43,179
to user groups taking up arms wanting to

00:32:40,869 --> 00:32:45,429
participate and bring about more people

00:32:43,179 --> 00:32:47,529
which speaks a lot to our community and

00:32:45,429 --> 00:32:51,239
how you know people go out of their way

00:32:47,529 --> 00:32:54,279
to bring more people into the community

00:32:51,239 --> 00:32:55,959
so not only are we growing the Drupal

00:32:54,279 --> 00:32:58,869
community but we're creating a great

00:32:55,959 --> 00:33:01,629
network and conversation on some of the

00:32:58,869 --> 00:33:03,639
best ways to bring about those new

00:33:01,629 --> 00:33:07,839
Drupal developers and theme errs and

00:33:03,639 --> 00:33:10,659
psyche site architects and so on we have

00:33:07,839 --> 00:33:14,739
the global training days about once a

00:33:10,659 --> 00:33:17,019
quarter it's an event where given time

00:33:14,739 --> 00:33:19,149
differences it goes probably a little

00:33:17,019 --> 00:33:22,599
bit beyond a day but it's a day

00:33:19,149 --> 00:33:25,329
dedicated to everyone at the same time

00:33:22,599 --> 00:33:27,399
around the world conducting these free

00:33:25,329 --> 00:33:29,019
or low-cost trainings which kind of

00:33:27,399 --> 00:33:30,549
brings about more of that community

00:33:29,019 --> 00:33:32,409
mindset that we're all doing this

00:33:30,549 --> 00:33:35,079
together it's a day of learning its day

00:33:32,409 --> 00:33:37,539
of training and so for anyone who is

00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:39,190
interested in becoming part of the

00:33:37,539 --> 00:33:43,809
global training day all you need to do

00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:47,049
is go to the drupal org slash learn dash

00:33:43,809 --> 00:33:48,579
drupal and hit add a training and what

00:33:47,049 --> 00:33:50,739
we'll do is we can provide you with some

00:33:48,579 --> 00:33:52,599
introductory slides as well as some

00:33:50,739 --> 00:33:54,129
curriculum that was used by some are

00:33:52,599 --> 00:33:55,899
generous training companies and user

00:33:54,129 --> 00:33:58,089
groups who've agreed to share their

00:33:55,899 --> 00:34:01,749
curriculum again to help that Drupal

00:33:58,089 --> 00:34:04,209
community grow once we have your event

00:34:01,749 --> 00:34:06,849
URL which you can set up on your own

00:34:04,209 --> 00:34:09,399
site or as a meetup event however works

00:34:06,849 --> 00:34:11,260
best for you we will place it on this

00:34:09,399 --> 00:34:14,619
event page and you'll see your listing

00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:17,889
under your country and once we get

00:34:14,619 --> 00:34:19,899
closer to time the event will send you

00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:22,359
out some global training Dave badges

00:34:19,899 --> 00:34:24,879
which you can show off on your website

00:34:22,359 --> 00:34:27,490
or whatever social media platform you

00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:30,369
wish and we all we ask in return is that

00:34:27,490 --> 00:34:32,950
you fill out our trainer survey so that

00:34:30,369 --> 00:34:34,539
we can get some feedback on what what

00:34:32,950 --> 00:34:37,510
worked what didn't work some of the

00:34:34,539 --> 00:34:40,450
numbers that you received and if you do

00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:43,230
not have your own student evaluation

00:34:40,450 --> 00:34:47,230
form we can also provide you with that

00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:47,990
and the picture you see here is one of

00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:50,869
our success

00:34:47,990 --> 00:34:55,310
stories we had a blistering solutions

00:34:50,869 --> 00:34:57,580
put on a global training day event that

00:34:55,310 --> 00:35:01,280
concluded with the drupalcamp Mumbai

00:34:57,580 --> 00:35:03,140
2012 and so they had about 200 odd

00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:06,020
participants from different fields and

00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:08,720
they had students they had business

00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:10,940
managers they had every every type of

00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:14,570
student you can imagine including this

00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:17,210
nine-year-old Karen and it was a great

00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:20,530
way to tie in learning about Drupal but

00:35:17,210 --> 00:35:23,119
also that Drupal is not just a

00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:25,760
technology there's also a growing and

00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:28,180
thriving community behind it and so this

00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:30,500
was one of our our great events from

00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:32,170
2012 was the way that they tied this

00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:35,330
into a camp so you went straight from

00:35:32,170 --> 00:35:41,230
global training day to witnessing a full

00:35:35,330 --> 00:35:44,180
drupalcamp great Thank You Ruth sorry

00:35:41,230 --> 00:35:48,710
question um so the global trading days

00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:51,230
is is there a specific thing that we're

00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:57,980
asking or not people to train on that

00:35:51,230 --> 00:36:00,590
day or is it a variety of topics so we

00:35:57,980 --> 00:36:03,619
have um to kind of introduction to

00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:07,220
Drupal versus what is Drupal and one is

00:36:03,619 --> 00:36:08,780
a introductory half day presentation

00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:12,440
whereas the other is a full day

00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:14,900
presentation and so it kind of works the

00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:17,240
benefit of the trainer and or student

00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:19,790
whichever works best for them if you

00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:21,770
really want to deep dive and learn all

00:36:19,790 --> 00:36:24,410
about Drupal you can do the full intro

00:36:21,770 --> 00:36:26,780
to Drupal day or if you really kind of

00:36:24,410 --> 00:36:29,210
are still trying to understand if you

00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:32,440
want to learn about this the what is

00:36:29,210 --> 00:36:41,359
Drupal is a great very general

00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:44,960
introduction to it great great are there

00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:47,890
any questions about the global training

00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:47,890
day program

00:36:54,160 --> 00:37:05,450
okay I think you do have one that's

00:36:57,530 --> 00:37:11,810

about a camp though okay let's uh let's

00:37:11,810 --> 00:37:18,470
save that for after nicks talk all right

00:37:16,310 --> 00:37:20,030
and we can address that one then and I

00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:22,220
do see one question coming in right now

00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:27,620
so willful for about five more seconds

00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:33,080
no judge that typing I can't type under

00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:37,900
pressure is gonna be tired yeah let's

00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:42,590
see what happens here so in the meantime

00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:44,150
Ruth oh yes so the question is again how

00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:45,350
do you sign up again for global training

00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:50,080
days can you run through that one more

00:37:45,350 --> 00:37:53,300
time absolutely it's drupal.org / learn

00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:56,870
dash drupal and you'll see on the right

00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:59,690
hand side there on this slide there's a

00:37:56,870 --> 00:38:01,700
link add a training and it takes you to

00:37:59,690 --> 00:38:05,090
a web form that you can fill out that'll

00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:07,460
ask you a variety of questions from your

00:38:05,090 --> 00:38:09,860
personal information email etc so that

00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:13,550
can contact you as well as where your

00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:15,080
event will be the URL which which of the

00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:23,840
trainings you think you want to do the

00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:25,100
introductory or the full day great and

00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:28,490
create a standard curriculum that we

00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:30,530
share with um we are still developing a

00:38:28,490 --> 00:38:33,950
standard curriculum we we like to share

00:38:30,530 --> 00:38:35,770
the hello drupal um program which can be

00:38:33,950 --> 00:38:39,470
a bit me t because it's a lot of slides

00:38:35,770 --> 00:38:42,680
so we encourage people to make them

00:38:39,470 --> 00:38:45,050
their own I'm beginning to share other

00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:46,610
trainers curriculum that they have been

00:38:45,050 --> 00:38:48,980
generous enough to share with us and

00:38:46,610 --> 00:38:51,790
we're working on developing a general

00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:51,790
training

00:38:53,740 --> 00:39:05,030
awesome awesome and a more global

00:38:57,020 --> 00:39:07,430
questions looks early okay here one of

00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:09,110
one of our folks it says that you know

00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:11,480
we Drupal's been making a lot of inroads

00:39:09,110 --> 00:39:15,260
in Europe in America but not much in

00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:17,090
Africa can we talk a little bit about

00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:19,910
what kinds of outreach / specifically

00:39:17,090 --> 00:39:21,080
doing on that continent andries I think

00:39:19,910 --> 00:39:26,120
we do have a couple of examples from

00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:28,790
global training days um we do we do have

00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:32,750
some trainings that are being conducted

00:39:28,790 --> 00:39:37,010
in Africa it's it's one of the programs

00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:39,560
that we offer that is very simple to

00:39:37,010 --> 00:39:43,970
conduct um in terms you just need to

00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:46,160
find a space and a computer and you can

00:39:43,970 --> 00:39:48,350
create you know very very basic

00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:52,040
slideshow if you move if you want out of

00:39:48,350 --> 00:39:53,690
those slides that we provide and the

00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:56,780
whole point of the global training days

00:39:53,690 --> 00:39:59,180
is again to foster that initial

00:39:56,780 --> 00:40:02,180
knowledge and once people kind of are

00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:04,550
initially introduced to Drupal and what

00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:06,560
it can be that's when they're pointed

00:40:04,550 --> 00:40:08,660
more towards the drupal association and

00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:13,750
how to you know register a username and

00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:13,750
get involved and join those user groups

00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:22,910
great and if it's another note that I

00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:24,290
think will follow up with the image

00:40:22,910 --> 00:40:26,870
became you asked that question as well

00:40:24,290 --> 00:40:29,750
to go part of chun chun li building is

00:40:26,870 --> 00:40:31,610
that we don't always know all the

00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:34,010
communities and so we have to start this

00:40:31,610 --> 00:40:35,570
approach so you want to put their boots

00:40:34,010 --> 00:40:38,840
on the ground so to speak and can help

00:40:35,570 --> 00:40:41,450
out so I will definitely follow up and

00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:46,250
see how we can help help you build a

00:40:41,450 --> 00:40:50,570
very community where you are yes yes

00:40:46,250 --> 00:40:53,690
great and can I get one more global

00:40:50,570 --> 00:40:56,510
training days in yes one more question

00:40:53,690 --> 00:40:58,640
do you have any promotional materials

00:40:56,510 --> 00:41:02,510
like a pimple fly or something like that

00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:05,560
for global training days um we have some

00:41:02,510 --> 00:41:09,470
da printable materials that will help

00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:10,870
with about general da introduction we

00:41:09,470 --> 00:41:13,250
would like to expand to have more

00:41:10,870 --> 00:41:18,290
printable easy ready to use global

00:41:13,250 --> 00:41:19,700
training day materials yes that's

00:41:18,290 --> 00:41:24,370
definitely her ideas only worth to us

00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:24,370
integrate those into into the program

00:41:24,490 --> 00:41:27,490
great

00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:43,680
okay so we do we have Nick on Nick the

00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:46,870
doll wonderful okay that is great neck

00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:50,620
so what we would like to do now is

00:41:46,870 --> 00:41:54,880
transition to talk a little bit about

00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:58,240
our scholarship program it's very

00:41:54,880 --> 00:42:01,390
important to us that the attendees at

00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:04,630
drupalcon reflect the diversity of the

00:42:01,390 --> 00:42:06,880
Drupal community so we provide a

00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:11,550
scholarship program to community members

00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:14,590
who could otherwise not attend a con and

00:42:11,550 --> 00:42:16,330
in order to qualify for a scholarship a

00:42:14,590 --> 00:42:19,030
community member needs to be an active

00:42:16,330 --> 00:42:21,400
contributor and then we also consider

00:42:19,030 --> 00:42:25,930
you know geographic diversity for each

00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:29,160
event these kinds of things these awards

00:42:25,930 --> 00:42:32,050
are given by a committee of volunteers

00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:34,840
but rather than listen to to me talk

00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:37,960
about it let me have turned it over to

00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:42,100
Nick the doll who is organizer of

00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:44,200
drupalcamp Brazil for 2011 and he's one

00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:51,220
of our South American Drupal community

00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:54,280
leaders so Nick hi Megan and everyone

00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:56,350
thanks for having me I was very

00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:59,530
fortunate to receive a scholarship to

00:42:56,350 --> 00:43:01,840
attend triple compartment and I would

00:42:59,530 --> 00:43:07,720
like to share some tips on the process

00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:13,200
of applying so my first did you can see

00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:16,780
on the next slide I think you have to

00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:19,960
show clear objectives and the best way

00:43:16,780 --> 00:43:25,420
to do this is to show what you have done

00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:29,470
and where do you want to go so in my

00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:32,530
case my objectives were very clear to

00:43:29,470 --> 00:43:35,950
attend triple calm person I were to meet

00:43:32,530 --> 00:43:40,180
the droop Association and I was very

00:43:35,950 --> 00:43:43,300
happy to meet people that I was just

00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:45,490
talking online but you personally

00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:49,570
meet them because I wanted to work with

00:43:45,490 --> 00:43:51,640
them on the future so i was able to

00:43:49,570 --> 00:43:56,260
attend a board meeting as well as a

00:43:51,640 --> 00:44:00,880
guest and to establish a relationship

00:43:56,260 --> 00:44:03,820
and the other objective was pretty much

00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:07,660
learn how to organize an international

00:44:03,820 --> 00:44:10,570
group event and what better events then

00:44:07,660 --> 00:44:14,970
drupalcon especially triple compartment

00:44:10,570 --> 00:44:19,030
which was one of the best and largest

00:44:14,970 --> 00:44:24,060
rubicon so i was very fortunate and very

00:44:19,030 --> 00:44:27,520
lucky to to attend this event and

00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:30,700
chewing a scholarship as well this has

00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:33,010
helped me a lot because for those

00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:35,110
brazilians and I imagine for many people

00:44:33,010 --> 00:44:40,150
to attend a drip of it's very

00:44:35,110 --> 00:44:44,820
extended because we have the travel

00:44:40,150 --> 00:44:49,630
costs sometimes I myself had to travel

00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:53,680
over 25 hours to get your drupalcon to

00:44:49,630 --> 00:44:56,650
get to Portland and basically the

00:44:53,680 --> 00:45:01,660
scholarship helped me to fund half of my

00:44:56,650 --> 00:45:06,870
costs involved with the trip so this was

00:45:01,660 --> 00:45:11,290
very important for me on the next slide

00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:15,750
I want to show the ongoing results of me

00:45:11,290 --> 00:45:18,460
attending drupalcon Portland and

00:45:15,750 --> 00:45:20,830
basically I wanted to meet the trip

00:45:18,460 --> 00:45:26,110
Association because I wanted to learn

00:45:20,830 --> 00:45:30,100
how how's the Association works to

00:45:26,110 --> 00:45:35,890
replicate is in Brazil and in Latin

00:45:30,100 --> 00:45:39,340
American this is a very interesting news

00:45:35,890 --> 00:45:42,120
that I have we are creating a Brazilian

00:45:39,340 --> 00:45:46,180
troop association at through boot camp

00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:48,340
sao paulo we have about three months ago

00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:50,560
we created the Brazilian troop

00:45:48,340 --> 00:45:54,970
association we had a meeting with the

00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:57,070
whole Brazilian community and so it was

00:45:54,970 --> 00:46:00,490
important for me to attend

00:45:57,070 --> 00:46:02,860
calm force them to understand how the

00:46:00,490 --> 00:46:05,620
drupal association works and try to

00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:08,440
replicate that we've seen the Brazilian

00:46:05,620 --> 00:46:11,710
community and we've seen the Latin

00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:14,890
American community as well and the goal

00:46:11,710 --> 00:46:18,940
here is for us to create a more

00:46:14,890 --> 00:46:21,730
centralized troop association how can we

00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:25,750
create create a drupal association that

00:46:21,730 --> 00:46:27,250
is global that's saturated and how can

00:46:25,750 --> 00:46:29,350
we help each other house in the

00:46:27,250 --> 00:46:32,050
Brazilian community help the

00:46:29,350 --> 00:46:34,540
international trip association and how

00:46:32,050 --> 00:46:38,830
can we create several troop associations

00:46:34,540 --> 00:46:45,810
in each country the health helps one and

00:46:38,830 --> 00:46:51,670
another so this is one of the objectives

00:46:45,810 --> 00:46:54,400
then I had and the other one is that we

00:46:51,670 --> 00:46:58,360
the lesson community were organizing an

00:46:54,400 --> 00:47:00,460
international group advanced called Drew

00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:03,790
book picture which will be in january

00:47:00,460 --> 00:47:07,450
2014 and i wouldn't you gain taste

00:47:03,790 --> 00:47:11,860
experience we here unless the mary has

00:47:07,450 --> 00:47:14,640
been growing a lot we have organized

00:47:11,860 --> 00:47:18,450
regional events national events

00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:21,130
continental events we just had our third

00:47:18,450 --> 00:47:24,520
Drupal suet Latino which is our

00:47:21,130 --> 00:47:30,190
continental event and just this first

00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:33,550
semester of 2013 we hand over 1,500

00:47:30,190 --> 00:47:36,670
participants in half a dozen through

00:47:33,550 --> 00:47:39,310
bootcamp we had a triple cap in fertile

00:47:36,670 --> 00:47:43,060
angry we had a drupalcamp yes that's

00:47:39,310 --> 00:47:46,150
that's the photo and this was part of

00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:47,860
the international free software forum

00:47:46,150 --> 00:47:50,470
it's one of the most important

00:47:47,860 --> 00:47:52,890
open-source events in the world overall

00:47:50,470 --> 00:47:57,490
they have seven thousand participants

00:47:52,890 --> 00:47:59,770
and we had a true bootcamp inside the

00:47:57,490 --> 00:48:03,120
International free software forum we

00:47:59,770 --> 00:48:06,670
also had triple camps in Colombia

00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:10,460
bolivia in Mexico we had as many

00:48:06,670 --> 00:48:13,430
attendees and simple of course

00:48:10,460 --> 00:48:15,950
so we're working towards creating a true

00:48:13,430 --> 00:48:18,830
international triple events the first

00:48:15,950 --> 00:48:21,800
one inside Latin America and that's

00:48:18,830 --> 00:48:25,700
going to be a triple picture so I'm very

00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:27,950
excited this scholarship really helps me

00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:32,060
and really help the community in the

00:48:27,950 --> 00:48:35,060
Latin community to gain this kind of

00:48:32,060 --> 00:48:39,080
experience so I really look forward to

00:48:35,060 --> 00:48:45,560
to meet everyone at drupa picture in

00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:50,030
january 2014 thanks thank you so much

00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:53,240
Nick Nick just one question could you

00:48:50,030 --> 00:48:57,050
could you share just a little bit about

00:48:53,240 --> 00:49:00,140
the the process of applying you know so

00:48:57,050 --> 00:49:02,380
like how what what did you do and then

00:49:00,140 --> 00:49:05,990
what how did you receive your

00:49:02,380 --> 00:49:09,050
scholarship mm-hmm actually it was a

00:49:05,990 --> 00:49:13,880
very easy process we had to fill out a

00:49:09,050 --> 00:49:16,490
form and we I think the means action is

00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:20,540
about talking about why you want to

00:49:16,490 --> 00:49:24,830
attend and basically why you need this

00:49:20,540 --> 00:49:28,910
financial assistance and a little bout

00:49:24,830 --> 00:49:31,339
your background your history so so the

00:49:28,910 --> 00:49:35,030
drupal association can see where you're

00:49:31,339 --> 00:49:39,140
going why is it why is it important they

00:49:35,030 --> 00:49:43,099
are attending the Drupal comb and what's

00:49:39,140 --> 00:49:47,540
going to happen what are the ongoing

00:49:43,099 --> 00:49:51,560
results so you will use very simple and

00:49:47,540 --> 00:49:59,000
I got a response back after a couple of

00:49:51,560 --> 00:50:02,990
weeks and I was able to bind the plane

00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:04,700
ticket and I think the drupal

00:50:02,990 --> 00:50:08,270
association actually bought this and I

00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:12,440
paid them back to cheer friends and it

00:50:08,270 --> 00:50:18,050
was a very easy process actually good

00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:21,430
good glad to hear that do we have any

00:50:18,050 --> 00:50:23,640
questions for Nick about the scholarship

00:50:21,430 --> 00:50:28,290
program

00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:32,820
I do not see any questions right now

00:50:28,290 --> 00:50:37,680
Stephanie okay okay well Nick thank you

00:50:32,820 --> 00:50:41,340
so much for a min yeah and and thank you

00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:45,240
so much to all of our speakers Nick Mike

00:50:41,340 --> 00:50:49,350
Carey and drew we really appreciate you

00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:52,800
sharing such valuable insights Holly are

00:50:49,350 --> 00:50:56,190
there other general questions for anyone

00:50:52,800 --> 00:51:01,470
else that we should answer before we

00:50:56,190 --> 00:51:06,470
close it looks like ones coming in so

00:51:01,470 --> 00:51:06,470
well okay tight great let's show it

00:51:06,830 --> 00:51:12,930
great so one question sophistic and l 00

00:51:11,190 --> 00:51:15,780
and then we did have a camps question to

00:51:12,930 --> 00:51:19,740
roll back to so i'll remember to do that

00:51:15,780 --> 00:51:25,590
in a second so so Mike this questions

00:51:19,740 --> 00:51:28,530
coming in about a holding him starting a

00:51:25,590 --> 00:51:35,310
new camp up in the western new western

00:51:28,530 --> 00:51:38,190
part of New York State and let's see the

00:51:35,310 --> 00:51:39,570
this commoner says that they spoke about

00:51:38,190 --> 00:51:41,940
this event in person with Stephanie and

00:51:39,570 --> 00:51:44,550
Joe at drupalcon in Portland followed

00:51:41,940 --> 00:51:47,760
Mike's advice to post a recap on the

00:51:44,550 --> 00:51:49,950
event organisation page 0 comments no

00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:51,750
follow-up so far from the DA have we

00:51:49,950 --> 00:51:57,990
done everything right to propose this as

00:51:51,750 --> 00:52:01,440
a new event format oh so I think I think

00:51:57,990 --> 00:52:05,970
I know what if i recall correctly this

00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:08,970
was for a it was like a mini camp type

00:52:05,970 --> 00:52:10,320
of an event right yeah it was actually

00:52:08,970 --> 00:52:13,470
it's a really interesting idea for a

00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:15,750
drupal event where it is it's the same

00:52:13,470 --> 00:52:17,970
idea as a camp but without all of the

00:52:15,750 --> 00:52:20,760
planning just kind of noise for

00:52:17,970 --> 00:52:23,010
organizers that what it's not like a

00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:24,930
full if I'm if I recall the details

00:52:23,010 --> 00:52:29,310
correctly it's not like a full eight to

00:52:24,930 --> 00:52:32,490
five day it was more of a hey let's find

00:52:29,310 --> 00:52:34,530
a venue and everybody go to that venue

00:52:32,490 --> 00:52:36,300
and then will you know it's more barcamp

00:52:34,530 --> 00:52:37,360
style we'll figure everything out once

00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:38,560
we get there

00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:39,730
it may have been a little bit more to

00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:44,020
that but that was kind of the general

00:52:39,730 --> 00:52:46,660
idea in order to kind of have these I

00:52:44,020 --> 00:52:50,050
wants a little maintenance but easier to

00:52:46,660 --> 00:52:52,530
organize many events so I'm not sure

00:52:50,050 --> 00:52:54,840
what the question is asking as far as I

00:52:52,530 --> 00:52:58,020
mean this is definitely something that

00:52:54,840 --> 00:53:00,130
we would be interested in funding um

00:52:58,020 --> 00:53:01,870
again it would have to meet you know our

00:53:00,130 --> 00:53:03,760
criteria like I don't think we would

00:53:01,870 --> 00:53:05,860
fund this in an area that already has

00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:08,110
you know a major camp every year that

00:53:05,860 --> 00:53:10,270
their sponsors who already exist and

00:53:08,110 --> 00:53:14,050
since that's a pup for you know

00:53:10,270 --> 00:53:16,150
definitely smaller geographic areas for

00:53:14,050 --> 00:53:18,010
an organizer to kind of step up and say

00:53:16,150 --> 00:53:20,550
hey I'm gonna I'm gonna try running one

00:53:18,010 --> 00:53:22,870
of these things and see how it goes um

00:53:20,550 --> 00:53:25,390
you know maybe an underserved you know

00:53:22,870 --> 00:53:28,510
area of the world it's definitely

00:53:25,390 --> 00:53:30,280
something we'd be interested in um all

00:53:28,510 --> 00:53:31,600
right well I'll uh I'll pass the URL

00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:34,030
over to you to make sure we didn't

00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:35,590
overlook it somehow yeah I'm not sure

00:53:34,030 --> 00:53:38,620
specifically what was the question

00:53:35,590 --> 00:53:40,390
asking as far as I think I was just

00:53:38,620 --> 00:53:42,010
looking for you know some feedback felt

00:53:40,390 --> 00:53:43,570
like you know they had they posted it in

00:53:42,010 --> 00:53:46,930
the right place but haven't got any

00:53:43,570 --> 00:53:48,070
feedback about it so um I love the idea

00:53:46,930 --> 00:53:55,240
I think we should I think someone should

00:53:48,070 --> 00:53:57,160
do it Oh source all along you can

00:53:55,240 --> 00:54:00,550
comment in the thread and that'll I

00:53:57,160 --> 00:54:03,550
think yeah hopefully yeah no I love the

00:54:00,550 --> 00:54:06,490
idea when those guys talk to me about it

00:54:03,550 --> 00:54:07,840
in portland and i know i i'd love to see

00:54:06,490 --> 00:54:09,970
some momentum behind it because i think

00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:12,100
it's a lot of times especially in new

00:54:09,970 --> 00:54:14,260
areas people are you know afraid enough

00:54:12,100 --> 00:54:17,800
of how do i organize meet up let alone a

00:54:14,260 --> 00:54:20,200
camp so this is this might be a nice

00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:22,510
first step you know of doing something

00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:23,860
bigger than a meet-up but not you know a

00:54:22,510 --> 00:54:26,230
lot of time just camps it's you know

00:54:23,860 --> 00:54:27,880
keeping up with the Joneses you know you

00:54:26,230 --> 00:54:29,500
go to another camp and they have you

00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:31,210
know it's catered and there's really

00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:33,670
good t-shirts and they're flying people

00:54:31,210 --> 00:54:35,350
and to speak then you think about doing

00:54:33,670 --> 00:54:38,800
a camp in your area and you're like whoa

00:54:35,350 --> 00:54:41,700
that's that's a lot of work yeah but

00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:44,290
these guys proposed is you know a

00:54:41,700 --> 00:54:45,250
hundred and ten percent valid were it

00:54:44,290 --> 00:54:47,100
doesn't have to be all that work you

00:54:45,250 --> 00:54:50,050
know all you really need for camp is a

00:54:47,100 --> 00:54:50,920
venue and people and you know projection

00:54:50,050 --> 00:54:55,480
system

00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:58,960
great so okay what happy to reply very

00:54:55,480 --> 00:55:01,500
positively to the idea good I will make

00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:03,549
sure you send that URL you all right

00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:07,359
good so we have a couple of other

00:55:03,549 --> 00:55:09,369
questions in the queue and one you know

00:55:07,359 --> 00:55:10,690
one thing actually wanted to go back to

00:55:09,369 --> 00:55:12,220
the question we had earlier about you

00:55:10,690 --> 00:55:14,410
know how do we build more community in a

00:55:12,220 --> 00:55:15,790
place like Africa specifically in a

00:55:14,410 --> 00:55:17,440
place like Nigeria where there is a lot

00:55:15,790 --> 00:55:19,750
of population it seems like there's you

00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:21,309
know there would be enough momentum for

00:55:19,750 --> 00:55:25,690
us to really do some good community

00:55:21,309 --> 00:55:28,210
building there the programs that we've

00:55:25,690 --> 00:55:29,950
talked about here today you know we try

00:55:28,210 --> 00:55:31,450
to be as internationally focused or

00:55:29,950 --> 00:55:33,940
internationally minded as we can and all

00:55:31,450 --> 00:55:35,470
those programs so for the community

00:55:33,940 --> 00:55:37,780
cultivation grants that Mike knows

00:55:35,470 --> 00:55:40,000
shared with us for global training days

00:55:37,780 --> 00:55:41,890
and for the scholarships those are all

00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:44,319
places where we're really able to work

00:55:41,890 --> 00:55:48,180
internationally you know very well so

00:55:44,319 --> 00:55:51,910
you know Mike in his team of volunteers

00:55:48,180 --> 00:55:54,490
they give out money all over the world

00:55:51,910 --> 00:55:56,890
which is really amazing and fantastic

00:55:54,490 --> 00:56:00,400
that that seed funding is really great

00:55:56,890 --> 00:56:04,030
so if you are working in a place that's

00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:08,549
maybe outside of the you know america

00:56:04,030 --> 00:56:10,960
nor europe you know drupal heavy places

00:56:08,549 --> 00:56:12,369
those cultivation grants are a great

00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:16,030
place to start to try to launch

00:56:12,369 --> 00:56:18,880
something in your community and the camp

00:56:16,030 --> 00:56:22,180
fiscal sponsorship that is right now

00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:23,710
limited to the US as administered by the

00:56:22,180 --> 00:56:25,750
drupal association and europe is

00:56:23,710 --> 00:56:28,589
administered by VZW which is the

00:56:25,750 --> 00:56:31,619
european entity where the whole thing

00:56:28,589 --> 00:56:36,460
started and that the drupal still see

00:56:31,619 --> 00:56:38,319
and that's you know mostly because you

00:56:36,460 --> 00:56:40,540
know there's just a lot of financial and

00:56:38,319 --> 00:56:42,760
legal laws around how we can disburse

00:56:40,540 --> 00:56:45,940
funds and hold money for various people

00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:47,530
and whatnot it's it's very complex for

00:56:45,940 --> 00:56:50,470
us to operate internationally in that

00:56:47,530 --> 00:56:53,950
fiscal sponsorship role so we know that

00:56:50,470 --> 00:56:55,690
that's you know an inhibitor for folks

00:56:53,950 --> 00:57:00,760
that might be working outside of the US

00:56:55,690 --> 00:57:02,470
or europe but we continue to work to

00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:04,630
figure out how we can provide a larger

00:57:02,470 --> 00:57:09,340
base of operations to really expand that

00:57:04,630 --> 00:57:10,870
program as well so just wanted to put

00:57:09,340 --> 00:57:12,400
that put that out there for folks who

00:57:10,870 --> 00:57:15,940
are maybe joining us from Latin America

00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:18,520
or Africa or you know the dollar ship

00:57:15,940 --> 00:57:20,050
the global training days and the

00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:22,180
community cultivation grants those are

00:57:20,050 --> 00:57:23,260
all you know right up your alley and we

00:57:22,180 --> 00:57:26,860
really encourage you to participate in

00:57:23,260 --> 00:57:29,530
those and another couple of actual

00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:31,570
questions the first one very a very

00:57:29,530 --> 00:57:33,990
tactical one where do I sign up for

00:57:31,570 --> 00:57:37,090
drupalcon sponsored scholarship and when

00:57:33,990 --> 00:57:39,690
and I'll just tackle this on on behalf

00:57:37,090 --> 00:57:47,710
of Nick so we usually announce the

00:57:39,690 --> 00:57:52,120
scholarship applications on website that

00:57:47,710 --> 00:57:55,830
you know whatever that con is so for

00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:59,290
Prague at Cena Prague 2013 dr. Borg and

00:57:55,830 --> 00:58:01,060
that those scholarship announcements you

00:57:59,290 --> 00:58:06,250
got to watch therefore when they open

00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:08,440
it's usually about a name the event is

00:58:06,250 --> 00:58:11,080
when we open up that scholarship process

00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:13,150
there and we have two kinds of money

00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:16,680
that we give out for Drupal cons there

00:58:13,150 --> 00:58:19,780
is a need-based scholarship and

00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:23,290
component and then now also a grant

00:58:19,780 --> 00:58:26,590
based contribution pool of money that we

00:58:23,290 --> 00:58:27,760
give out the idea is and this is piloted

00:58:26,590 --> 00:58:29,680
here in Prague for the first time that

00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:31,390
you know we know that there's a set of

00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:33,340
people we need to get to drupalcon

00:58:31,390 --> 00:58:35,950
because they are contribute to the

00:58:33,340 --> 00:58:38,350
project and they need to be with other

00:58:35,950 --> 00:58:40,000
contributors to the project and then we

00:58:38,350 --> 00:58:42,820
know that there are people that we just

00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:49,420
want to get to triple con in order to

00:58:42,820 --> 00:58:56,580
expand the diver or your that the

00:58:49,420 --> 00:58:56,580
conference geographic

00:58:57,069 --> 00:59:02,989
so both those programs and you can look

00:59:00,380 --> 00:59:05,239
for those there and sign up and then

00:59:02,989 --> 00:59:07,489
usually by about 60 days out we've got

00:59:05,239 --> 00:59:09,609
the whole thing buttoned up the the

00:59:07,489 --> 00:59:11,960
selections have been made people been

00:59:09,609 --> 00:59:13,249
communicated with so for Prague that

00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:14,239
around is already closed and the

00:59:13,249 --> 00:59:16,880
scholarships and grants have been

00:59:14,239 --> 00:59:23,509
announced but you know we'll be opening

00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:29,029
that back up for Austin probably in

00:59:23,509 --> 00:59:33,049
early 2014 18 so look for that then can

00:59:29,029 --> 00:59:40,789
I get one more in stuff t yes definitely

00:59:33,049 --> 00:59:45,079
one more yes okay so last last question

00:59:40,789 --> 00:59:47,809
that came in looks like a couple of I

00:59:45,079 --> 00:59:50,839
like this in in Spanish it's to do pal

00:59:47,809 --> 00:59:55,130
arrows instead of drew blurs drupal

00:59:50,839 --> 00:59:59,029
arrows I love that so a couple of joyful

00:59:55,130 --> 01:00:00,829
arrows in Mexico they're launching a new

00:59:59,029 --> 01:00:04,249
training initiative called the Drupal

01:00:00,829 --> 01:00:07,249
date or so Drupal there would be a free

01:00:04,249 --> 01:00:08,479
one one-day training event for anyone to

01:00:07,249 --> 01:00:11,180
come and learn how to build websites

01:00:08,479 --> 01:00:16,269
with Drupal they want to organize the

01:00:11,180 --> 01:00:20,380
event every two or three monkey

01:00:16,269 --> 01:00:24,859
happening between april or june in

01:00:20,380 --> 01:00:26,539
mexico city so a question here is you

01:00:24,859 --> 01:00:29,509
know how could the Drupal say she

01:00:26,539 --> 01:00:31,609
Association help them find sponsors for

01:00:29,509 --> 01:00:36,559
that event so how they help kick-start

01:00:31,609 --> 01:00:37,999
that so I think one thing I would do is

01:00:36,559 --> 01:00:42,019
maybe turn things over to Ruth for a

01:00:37,999 --> 01:00:43,849
second I'm asked roof you know this

01:00:42,019 --> 01:00:45,819
seems like it might be a good fit to me

01:00:43,849 --> 01:00:48,499
try to align some dates with global

01:00:45,819 --> 01:00:51,680
training days to help get that extra

01:00:48,499 --> 01:00:54,920
added publicity boost that seems right

01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:57,349
to you yes definitely um yeah they would

01:00:54,920 --> 01:01:01,099
not be alone there's actually a group in

01:00:57,349 --> 01:01:04,430
India doing a similar thing and so if

01:01:01,099 --> 01:01:06,469
they kind of like a send me an email

01:01:04,430 --> 01:01:08,599
about with the dates they think are

01:01:06,469 --> 01:01:10,720
happening we have not yet actually set

01:01:08,599 --> 01:01:15,290
up the dates for

01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:20,000
2014 so if anyone has a regular

01:01:15,290 --> 01:01:22,750
occurring kind of meat ax like that I

01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:26,090
would definitely love to align that

01:01:22,750 --> 01:01:30,290
great yeah and so you can retrieve just

01:01:26,090 --> 01:01:34,970
a roof at association that people that

01:01:30,290 --> 01:01:36,710
were at work and it seems like as a

01:01:34,970 --> 01:01:41,360
brand new about this week's weight thing

01:01:36,710 --> 01:01:44,740
maybe to line up with a mic your commute

01:01:41,360 --> 01:01:44,740
conservation graham and it's as well

01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:58,430
mm-hmm George that yes sure sweets

01:01:55,240 --> 01:02:01,820
you're here you're starting an IV lcds

01:01:58,430 --> 01:02:03,650
or better piece I question you were

01:02:01,820 --> 01:02:08,030
cutting in and out for me a little bit I

01:02:03,650 --> 01:02:10,880
didn't get the whole thing great i will

01:02:08,030 --> 01:02:15,470
also speak more slowly perhaps that will

01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:17,870
help um the last bit is how how would he

01:02:15,470 --> 01:02:20,060
find sponsors or she'd find sponsors but

01:02:17,870 --> 01:02:25,760
in this event and i think that's a great

01:02:20,060 --> 01:02:29,720
place to uh you know the future stuff

01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:32,990
that were working on and one of the I

01:02:29,720 --> 01:02:35,360
think helping our community connect with

01:02:32,990 --> 01:02:38,240
the Drupal businesses around the world

01:02:35,360 --> 01:02:40,370
who are honestly looking for sponsorship

01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:42,500
opportunities I mean they're constantly

01:02:40,370 --> 01:02:44,120
asking us how do we find out who's

01:02:42,500 --> 01:02:45,380
running camps how do we find out was

01:02:44,120 --> 01:02:46,700
doing trainings around the world we

01:02:45,380 --> 01:02:51,280
really want to connect with these people

01:02:46,700 --> 01:02:51,280
and you know sponsor what they're doing

01:02:52,180 --> 01:02:58,130
so so the the drupal association

01:02:55,520 --> 01:03:01,790
definitely sees that there is room for

01:02:58,130 --> 01:03:06,170
us to support that most to do it in a

01:03:01,790 --> 01:03:08,510
real way so Megan on our team has really

01:03:06,170 --> 01:03:11,030
been working to cultivate a list of

01:03:08,510 --> 01:03:13,550
those organizations Drupal shops but

01:03:11,030 --> 01:03:15,530
also as you know other web related

01:03:13,550 --> 01:03:18,950
service providers that integrate with

01:03:15,530 --> 01:03:21,950
Drupal and you know we're working to

01:03:18,950 --> 01:03:23,840
create a list of those folks that we can

01:03:21,950 --> 01:03:25,820
share with the community so

01:03:23,840 --> 01:03:28,910
when you are putting on an event you can

01:03:25,820 --> 01:03:31,490
easily reach out to sponsors and help
