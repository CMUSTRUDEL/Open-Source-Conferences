00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:22,560
I'm really thrilled this year at the

00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:25,529
turnout both in terms of the candidates

00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:27,830
we had over lots of candidates from all

00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:30,980
over the world which is really amazing

00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:34,110
but also thrilled with the turnout today

00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:36,120
we have more spectators than candidates

00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:40,079
which has not been my experience in past

00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:41,940
purple Association watches terribly yeah

00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,010
so grateful that so many people are out

00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:45,390
there and taking an interest and really

00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:47,190
wanting to learn about the folks who are

00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:50,850
running for the seat so hopefully

00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:52,590
today's session will help you do that we

00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:55,379
are going to record today's session I'll

00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:58,020
make that available up on YouTube when

00:00:55,379 --> 00:00:59,640
the session ends so you'll see the the

00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:02,550
link in the blog post and in the

00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:05,189
elections section of our website change

00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:07,110
from you know join the meeting to watch

00:01:05,189 --> 00:01:09,900
the recording so take a look out for

00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:11,900
that when we're done um and here's just

00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:15,090
a few logistics for everyone today so

00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:16,500
all of our spectators not the candidates

00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:19,229
but everyone else who's just listening

00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:20,759
in you guys are muted automatically to

00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:23,880
keep the background noise to a minimum

00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:26,009
but that does not mean that we do not

00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:29,369
want to hear from you in fact it's just

00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:31,200
the opposite today is your chance to get

00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:34,409
some questions out there so we want you

00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:37,320
to ask them you've got a Q&A section of

00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:39,479
your control panel there so you can feel

00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:41,880
free to share a question that you have

00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:44,820
for a particular candidate or all the

00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:49,200
candidates in that Q&A section and I'll

00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:51,659
be monitoring those to make sure that

00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:55,350
you got to I'll be monitoring those to

00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:57,180
make sure that we ask them and as I said

00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:59,430
I haven't had the experience of so many

00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:01,110
folks listening in line before so

00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:04,140
hopefully we get to the mall I'll do my

00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:07,439
best if we don't get them to them all I

00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:09,959
have a record of all the questions and I

00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:11,610
will do my best to get them posted up on

00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:14,069
the candidate pages so people can

00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:17,219
respond in their profiles

00:02:14,069 --> 00:02:18,780
so here's how things are going to work

00:02:17,219 --> 00:02:20,579
once we get past these logistic

00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:23,219
announcements I'm just going to let you

00:02:20,579 --> 00:02:24,810
know briefly who's on the line we have a

00:02:23,219 --> 00:02:27,659
lot of candidates so we don't have time

00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:30,209
to do longer candidate statements as I

00:02:27,659 --> 00:02:31,859
was hoping we would at the beginning but

00:02:30,209 --> 00:02:33,650
i'll introduce each of the candidates

00:02:31,859 --> 00:02:35,519
that are here and share their profiles

00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:38,579
just so you know we're not going to have

00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:42,450
a lot of other visuals today so you know

00:02:38,579 --> 00:02:43,980
tune in with your ears and then once we

00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:46,500
get past the introductions will switch

00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:48,030
to Q&A format i will kick off with a

00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:50,790
couple of questions and then work in

00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:52,349
your questions as we go again we're

00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:55,079
recording everything so if you miss it

00:02:52,349 --> 00:02:57,900
or want to share it it'll be up within a

00:02:55,079 --> 00:03:00,930
couple of hours of the session and

00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:04,709

00:04:17,789 --> 00:04:23,010
question is going to be lame you on the

00:04:20,039 --> 00:04:24,870
community as well that's right I'll be

watching the questions come in through

00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:30,450

00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:43,710

all right what else okay well then one

00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:47,960
other reminder that someone asked for in

00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:50,730
the question section we are elekton

00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:54,870
person to serve a two-year term on the

00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:57,810
board and that's the world the term that

00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:59,730
they will serve they'll serve along side

00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:01,140
Matthew Sanders the other at large board

00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:04,560
director who's elected in the last

00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:06,840
community action and the role of the

00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,910
board is an obviously really important

00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:11,310
one that the board is the keeper of the

00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:15,210
strategy for the drupal association so

00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:17,190
they help set the direction and that's

00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:19,740
obviously a really important role to

00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:23,419
play and in addition to setting that

00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:26,700
direction they also are responsible

00:05:23,419 --> 00:05:31,169
bottom line for the fiscal soundness of

00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:33,030
the organization so they are going to be

00:05:31,169 --> 00:05:36,030
reviewing financials on a monthly basis

00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:38,820
and sorry a quarterly basis ensuring the

00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:41,190
association is no on track they're all

00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:43,200
so bottom line responsible for making

00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:46,979
sure that the association is just doing

00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:48,960
its work well so in compliance with you

00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:53,550
know all the important laws that govern

00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:57,870
our work and that we are doing our work

00:05:53,550 --> 00:06:00,090
also in the spirit of our values right

00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:02,340
and alignment with our mission and

00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:05,430
vision so the poor plays a really

00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:07,229
important role it is sometimes tactical

00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:08,520
sometimes board members will come down

00:06:07,229 --> 00:06:11,790
and do things like help make a

00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:13,710
fundraiser go or sit down and help us

00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:15,360
work through a marketing plan but most

00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:17,100
of the work is at that strategic level

00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,080
is this the right direction for the

00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:21,560
organization those are the kinds of

00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:27,570
conversations we we tend to focus on so

00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:29,580
that's the work and one other one other

00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:31,020
quick reminder candidates when you do

00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:33,300
begin to answer a question to be great

00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:35,310
if you use your name so because we don't

00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:37,890
know who you are so you know like hey

00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:42,150
this is adam and here's my response yada

00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:43,590
yada yada all right I think we got

00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:45,330
full of questions reminders out of the

00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:48,270
way there I'm ready to dive into

00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:51,390
questions let's do it okay so the first

00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:53,700
question is what is the most critical

00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:56,490
issue facing the project the Drupal

00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:58,680
project today and what do you think the

00:06:56,490 --> 00:07:05,070
role of the Association should be in

00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:08,580
contributing to its solution so what's

00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:09,570
the most critical issue facing north do

00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:17,250
you want to do it so hard auction of

00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:20,910
everybody oh let me make it start with

00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:22,500
questions or problem but you know ok

00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:25,110
here we go for the intros I'm gonna do

00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:27,030
them for else ok all right so here's

00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:28,710
what we got our first candidate I think

00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:31,800
these are vaguely alphabetical order by

00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:35,130
last name Addison Perry uh Addison works

00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:37,350
in at lula bot or she's been a long long

00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:38,460
time contributor at Lobot she's been

00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:43,290
part of the community for a really long

00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:45,210
time and she has made also an amazing

00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:48,570
personal journey she lives in Denmark

00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:51,660
she's an expat there and has been played

00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:53,880
a lot of different roles she's been um i

00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:55,560
think if i remember correctly started

00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:57,000
with some documentation edits right and

00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:59,370
has moved around and done lots of

00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,130
different contribution so addison is our

00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:05,430
first candidate here today we also have

00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:06,780
a pair I'll produce up or I don't know

00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:13,050
how to say your last name how do you say

00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:14,430
that good chair okay and you are very

00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:17,580
faint so you're gonna have to speak up a

00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:20,490
lot when it's your turn so Albert um

00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:22,320
isn't interesting candidate as well from

00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:25,350
Turkey which i think is really exciting

00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:29,460
and he runs polygon interactive and has

00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:32,660
been working on triple since d6 I me

00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:36,270
Gupta is representing India here today

00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:38,100
he has founded I think he's worked in

00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:42,180
there in the community for a number of

00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:45,140
years oh yes since 2004 back in triple

00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:49,320
four days and founded a shop in Delhi

00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:54,030
and so he works at accelerant now in in

00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:55,100
India Adam Hill has been another those

00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:56,449
are all longtime drupal

00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:59,569
so I guess that's redundant at this

00:08:56,449 --> 00:09:01,279
point and Adams played a number of

00:08:59,569 --> 00:09:04,220
different different roles in the

00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:06,680
community he runs an agency but he also

00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:11,800
has been involved heavily in Drupal cons

00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:15,019
and the Drupal community working group

00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:17,480
we also have on the line Victor Victor

00:09:15,019 --> 00:09:20,060
levendusky Victor is based in the

00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:23,240
Ukraine luckily Western Ukraine and not

00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:27,440

own triple shop in the Ukraine as well

00:09:32,709 --> 00:09:42,170
also on the line Carlos ospina Carlos uh

00:09:35,899 --> 00:09:43,880
is a base in Houston but is Colombia and

00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:46,850
I think by birth I hope I got remembered

00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:48,800
that correctly and has been engaged in

00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:50,569
the last few years really active in the

00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,130
Latin American community and was

00:09:50,569 --> 00:09:53,720
definitely very instrumental in helping

00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:57,519
us run through pecan Latin America

00:09:53,720 --> 00:10:01,189
earlier this month and Michael Schmidt

00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:02,899
schnitzel michael has been also involved

00:10:01,189 --> 00:10:06,170
in the in the community for a very long

00:10:02,899 --> 00:10:09,290
time in a variety of ways he works at

00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:12,259
amazing laughs was based in Zurich and

00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:13,910
you may recognize Michael because we put

00:10:12,259 --> 00:10:16,910
him in all sorts of precarious positions

00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:18,620
to take our pictures at every drupalcon

00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:21,110
he's been in charge of the official

00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:23,920
group photo so he's hung from the

00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:27,920
rafters and climbed up on ladders and

00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:33,160
lobbied hard to allow us to use drones

00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:35,930
to take people's pictures so all right

00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:37,550
well you can you hear me uh Enzo sorry

00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:40,399
that's right you joined us a little late

00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:42,110
Enzo's with us as well um and let me

00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:47,240
just pull up and Zoe's profile for

00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:50,689
everyone Muriel another candidate from

00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:52,069
Colombia uh who's also really helpful

00:10:50,689 --> 00:10:54,560
for us and putting together drupalcon

00:10:52,069 --> 00:10:57,380
Latin America super important for us to

00:10:54,560 --> 00:11:00,800
get that event done he's been part of

00:10:57,380 --> 00:11:03,680
the Drupal community since Drupal 6 and

00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:06,559
I think has also been really helpful in

00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:09,010
getting the Latin community together as

00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:12,930
well did anyone else join

00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:12,930
i miss anyone in that in the interim

00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:23,800
let's just double-check okay and we do

00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:27,040
have a questions is Adam work for an

00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:29,050
agency he does I bet he'll get to talk

00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:32,980
about that a little bit too all right so

00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:35,980
it looks like I got everyone excellent

00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:37,060
thanks for patients with that all right

00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:40,080
well now you guys have had a long time

00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:40,080
to think about that question right

00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:47,200
repeat you feed that please well all

00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:49,090
right let's move into the question so

00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,950
what is the most critical issue facing

00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:54,210
the project today how can the

00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:57,400
Association contribute to addressing it

00:11:54,210 --> 00:12:00,460
can answer how do we go about this Holly

00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:02,140
jump right see why yeah jump right in if

00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:03,640
you have a question I'm just or if you

00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:07,890
haven't answer just remember say who you

00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:11,020
are when you start all right it's Annie

00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:13,780
one of the things that I see is that the

00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:17,110
trooper project by organic means and

00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:20,050
drone massive I'm in India and a lot of

00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:21,610
people still don't know about it people

00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:23,350
that are working with Drupal don't even

00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:26,320
know that there is a community of Round

00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:30,220
Room which is really astounding to me

00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:34,270
right the religion is doing a fantastic

00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:38,080
job around North America even South

00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:39,730
America or another places but India

00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:44,320
which is the second largest population

00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:47,020
of Google drupal.org we are not getting

00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:50,200
a lot of people understood what Drupal

00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:52,780
project is all about I think one of the

00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:54,610
things that that I feel it's important

00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:58,270
for people association is to reach out

00:12:54,610 --> 00:13:00,880
on a much larger scale to make sure

00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:03,760
people realize that the Drupal project

00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:06,280
is not a software project it's a open

00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:08,500
source community project it's about

00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:12,850
contribution it's about help it's about

00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:15,250
making things happen each I mean I can

00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:20,740
go on but I think I'll just stick to

00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:23,410
that one so this format thanks I would

00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:25,390
I will mention a shorter term issue and

00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:28,800
that's what I see currently happening

00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:31,390
and all of the world is Drupal 8 that

00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:33,820
because we are open source community but

00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:35,620
a lot of people use Drupal and as an

00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:38,920
enterprise system they sometimes belief

00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:42,970
that we and have like release cycles

00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:44,440
like other proprietary software and so a

00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:47,500
lot of people talk about Drupal 8 and

00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:49,779
they hear that it's coming out and some

00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:51,670
of my friends working at other software

00:13:49,779 --> 00:13:53,830
systems already choking me asking me so

00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:57,190
when it's coming out so I think we do a

00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:59,560
bit a bad job of like telling people how

00:13:57,190 --> 00:14:01,120
its developed and of course we say it's

00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:02,589
done when it's done but that sometimes

00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:05,860
really hard to explain people that are

00:14:02,589 --> 00:14:07,660
not into open source so it's one of the

00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:10,690
of the really things we have to be

00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:13,570
careful about is how or that we make

00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:16,089
sure that triple eight is coming out on

00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:17,800
time with a timeline that everybody

00:14:16,089 --> 00:14:19,270
understands and the drupal association

00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:21,399
itself should support that with

00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:24,190
providing the right tools as we do right

00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:27,520
now with the s very grand and which is

00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:29,700
super great to to support the last

00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:32,860
pieces because everybody that does and

00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:35,320
development knows the last box or the

00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:37,300
hardest ones or the hearts of tackle and

00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:38,890
sometimes it just need a lot of time to

00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:40,630
sit down and fix them and I think the

00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:42,100
Drupal 8 that's littering by the

00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:46,329
Association there's a really great job

00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:50,800
in making sure that we get out drupal 8

00:14:46,329 --> 00:14:53,740
and in time and with at less risk box as

00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:56,649
possible thanks and everyone that was

00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:59,230
that was Michael Schmidt and I will do

00:14:56,649 --> 00:15:01,000
my best to try to pull up each candidate

00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:05,410
while they speak so you can see their

00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:08,920
profile a little bit okay this is carlos

00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:11,079
Espina um I think we have two things

00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:13,720
that we have to pay attention on the

00:15:11,079 --> 00:15:16,390
community one is the diversity of the

00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:18,940
community which is getting huge and

00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:21,370
bigger every time as Annie said there's

00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:23,740
still so many much so much more people

00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:25,959
that is using Drupal and it's not part

00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:28,779
of the community so we need to work on

00:15:25,959 --> 00:15:32,100
that but definitely the most important

00:15:28,779 --> 00:15:34,510
problem Ragnar or issue is Drupal 8

00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:36,760
which needs to be out

00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:40,450
technology is moving forward faster than

00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:43,180
we can keep up with and drupal egg is

00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:46,090
doing a great job about that I think one

00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:47,830
of the problems is are we have to make

00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:49,600
sure people understand what's the

00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:52,630
evolution that is happening with Drupal

00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:56,620
8 not only as a software but as a

00:15:52,630 --> 00:16:00,310
framework and as a semi new tool for the

00:15:56,620 --> 00:16:04,930
community and how can we use it to be

00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:07,930
any better in our jobs and our workers

00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:10,270
programmers and developers and project

00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:12,670
managers etc that's on the side of

00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:14,920
Drupal 8 and get used to it so I think

00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:19,300
so far we've been doing a great job with

00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:22,570
the grants and all that and keep that

00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:24,550
work going forward and make sure we keep

00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:30,250
the diversity and reaching out to

00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:32,920
everybody as we have been trying that's

00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:38,530
it thanks girls other folks want to

00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:41,140
answer that goodnight yes is Adam great

00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:42,400
and I think for me that it's a really

00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:43,510
hard question because the fact that all

00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:45,490
the other candidates just covered with

00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:47,050
you was it big things which i would i

00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:49,150
would mention but i think one of the

00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:52,360
biggest ones for me is about the

00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:53,890
community is way way bigger than the

00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:56,110
contributors and i think that the

00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:58,990
getting people inspiring people and

00:16:56,110 --> 00:17:02,290
helping people on a global scale to

00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:04,240
contribute you know more often in

00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:06,579
different kinds of ways is a really

00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:08,260
important point i wouldn't say it's so

00:17:06,579 --> 00:17:09,910
much a problem i think some of the other

00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:11,890
things that other kinds have mentioned a

00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:14,110
bigger problems but i think it's a it's

00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:15,370
an opportunity that that's kind of

00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:18,520
missed at the moment in terms of the

00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:19,750
amount of resources and people that

00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:21,579
could be helping who aren't quite sure

00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:24,160
how to do it I think part of that is

00:17:21,579 --> 00:17:27,070
around from the Association point of

00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:28,449
view the accessibility in the Drupal

00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:30,850
website in terms of pointing people in

00:17:28,449 --> 00:17:32,080
the right direction and there's a lot of

00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:34,060
good work obviously got into this

00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:36,040
already but i think that the association

00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:37,950
could be pushing people more to

00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:40,330
understand the value especially from the

00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:44,500
drupal shop point of view the value in

00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:46,990
contributing back to the community if i

00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:47,700
may jump in holly is that all right yeah

00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:50,610
absolutely

00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:52,789
all right I don't moonship a very

00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:55,710
important point contribution uh you

00:17:52,789 --> 00:17:58,529
identify yourself though I'm sorry sorry

00:17:55,710 --> 00:18:02,039
it's ani ani from video from Bombay

00:17:58,529 --> 00:18:04,580
thanks Annie and one of the things that

00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:07,679
we need to also understand is a

00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:09,870
contribution the word contribution or

00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:12,120
the process of contribution is not

00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:14,389
really that easy for people to

00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:17,610
understand whether it be a developer or

00:18:14,389 --> 00:18:23,429
even a business owner and I've seen the

00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:24,870
entire gamut you know from 2004 a lot of

00:18:23,429 --> 00:18:27,570
times it's important for people to

00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:30,600
understand that just even having a camp

00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:34,350
or having a small tiny media is

00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:38,070
contribution that evangelizes Drupal and

00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:40,500
I think Drupal associations help in

00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:43,019
trying to understand where there are

00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:45,299
massive amounts of the weather is a

00:18:43,019 --> 00:18:47,100
maximum is a potential but there's

00:18:45,299 --> 00:18:48,960
nothing happening in terms of okay why

00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:53,100
are people not actually putting out

00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:55,409
their contributions that could be really

00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:58,289
interesting to study and to actually

00:18:55,409 --> 00:19:00,779
improvement so contribution of me it's

00:18:58,289 --> 00:19:04,529
not just code contribution to me is

00:19:00,779 --> 00:19:07,529
about everything do around building a

00:19:04,529 --> 00:19:10,019
great supportive empowering community

00:19:07,529 --> 00:19:12,510
yeah and I bet most folks here

00:19:10,019 --> 00:19:13,740
definitely agree with that yeah are

00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:15,240
there some others who haven't spoken yet

00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:21,480
who want to share some answers to that

00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:22,889
question hi and so and so I hear you

00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:24,659
about your kind of faint can you get

00:19:22,889 --> 00:19:28,649
closer to your mic and speak up really

00:19:24,659 --> 00:19:32,580
loud sure hi this is Eduardo Garcia ok

00:19:28,649 --> 00:19:35,669
and so I'm for me the most important is

00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:37,440
chris on promoter language but if we can

00:19:35,669 --> 00:19:39,690
track contribution by country we can't

00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,730
attend most of them comes from USA and

00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:45,899
Europe countries but where English is

00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:47,789
not a problem but it I think as a drupal

00:19:45,899 --> 00:19:49,169
association we can and complex

00:19:47,789 --> 00:19:51,240
communities to create his phone

00:19:49,169 --> 00:19:53,610
documentation but I I not talk I'm not

00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:56,850
thinking about the commutation as a PA I

00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:59,129
am thinking in encourage community from

00:19:56,850 --> 00:20:01,740
China from Africa and so Hayley in Latin

00:19:59,129 --> 00:20:04,110
America in Spanish to create his own too

00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:07,770
Orioles billion screencaps to try to

00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:10,950
bring new new developers near the

00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:15,059
commuters new new new community leaders

00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:17,250
to try to improve the amount and the way

00:20:15,059 --> 00:20:18,750
we can represent a in the loop

00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:21,510
relationship because right now these

00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:24,210
billions our technology consumers but

00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:26,610
basing population 18 with the proper

00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:29,179
documentation information we can create

00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:34,010
another year and to share with the world

00:20:29,179 --> 00:20:37,370
great point only this is ultra kami oh

00:20:34,010 --> 00:20:41,730
sorry one more time cuz I didn't hear ya

00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:46,440
it's out there you can hear me almost

00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:48,510
it's awfully quiet hello you read me

00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:52,890
there that's better out there thank you

00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:54,900
okay okay I'd like to have a and I would

00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:58,140
say a different point of view to the

00:20:54,900 --> 00:21:00,990
question and the answer when we talk

00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:04,650
about a problem the problem probably

00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:07,980
arises due to competition and we just

00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:11,580
talked about Drupal as an open source a

00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:13,860
good framework a very I would say the

00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:16,860
talented one of the best I've ever work

00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:18,809
with framework to work on but when we

00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:21,929
talk with the real work the customers

00:21:18,809 --> 00:21:24,059
they always talk about other CMS options

00:21:21,929 --> 00:21:28,140
like EULA and WordPress and things like

00:21:24,059 --> 00:21:31,140
that so I guess our first priority to

00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:33,900
have a success in this project is to

00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:36,330
clearly identify what Drupal is and how

00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:39,720
big and how successful and how capable

00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:43,200
it is so i would say that as the drupal

00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:45,150
association we should also really have a

00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:48,450
concentration on the management level

00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:52,110
strategic marketing actions of Drupal

00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:54,870
because if we market Drupal the project

00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:58,980
itself we can have more contribution

00:21:54,870 --> 00:22:00,750
from everywhere and it's also Drupal

00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:03,360
associations i would say prime

00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:06,330
responsibility to create this energy

00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:08,880
within the community and make things

00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:11,730
really working on so i would say that

00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:14,669
everything whether you are a developer

00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:15,630
or an end user or a finance guy order

00:22:14,669 --> 00:22:19,050
whatever you are

00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:23,550
over here in Drupal you should also act

00:22:19,050 --> 00:22:27,290
as a I would say defender of Drupal in

00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:33,060
all operations in all circumstances

00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:38,580
thank you I'll go ahead and take a turn

00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:40,830
this is addy um and um I definitely

00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:43,080
agree with with what other people have

00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:45,060
said about priorities and I think like

00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:48,060
an immediate priority a lot of people's

00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:50,250
radar is Drupal 8 coming out and I do

00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:53,100
think that the drupal association has

00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:56,010
taken steps to help facilitate moving

00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:59,640
that forward already which is great one

00:22:56,010 --> 00:23:00,900
of the things that's to me from from my

00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:05,190
perspective on things in the community

00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:06,990
is is the growth as has been mentioned

00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:08,970
and and sort of getting people

00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:12,090
onboarding people more into the

00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:15,720
community but growing the base of the

00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:18,540
community without having proper

00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:21,510
structures or markers in place for those

00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:24,240
people ends up creating a mess in a lot

00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:25,800
of ways we found this like with the

00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:28,560
documentation it's like we don't

00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:30,330
actually need everybody necessarily to

00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:32,400
do documentation we need a little bit

00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:35,850
more structure to how that gets done and

00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:39,870
so the overall and there are many

00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:42,870
leadership structure conversations going

00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:45,780
on in the community that have been a

00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:48,390
little complicated in terms of how do we

00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:50,430
we're huge and we're trying to control

00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:52,530
we're trying to do a software project as

00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:54,600
well as a whole bunch of community

00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:56,340
activities and what are the leadership

00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:59,130
structures there we've grown to the size

00:23:56,340 --> 00:24:01,380
where frankly we need to have some

00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:03,510
structure it exists whether or not you

00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:06,390
acknowledge it and i think the drupal

00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:07,770
association facilitating the space and

00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:09,480
the conversations for those and

00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:11,910
communicating those well to the

00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:13,410
community is going to be very important

00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:17,100
if we really want to grow on a

00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:20,310
sustainable and healthy way much like we

00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:22,410
don't direct the Drupal code per se but

00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:24,390
we put a lot of structures in place so

00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:27,540
the community can solve those code

00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:29,250
problems I feel like looking at the

00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:31,200
these leadership

00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:34,380
and structure issues is one of those

00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:37,110
really sticky grey areas that probably

00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:39,960
needs some push and some support from

00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:42,750
from the drupal association in order to

00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:46,220
to get to some resolutions that would

00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:50,190
carry us forward awesome thanks addy

00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:52,650
Victor are you there I'm a gun yeah I am

00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:55,050
writing as well 22 to stick yeah we'd

00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:58,850
love to hear from you Victor yeah okay

00:24:55,050 --> 00:25:02,850
so my thought is main goal too popular

00:24:58,850 --> 00:25:05,370
to promote drupal outside Drupal

00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:08,160
community because I'm for example I

00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:10,980
remember of a lot of IT association

00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:15,000
lives in my country also I attend a lot

00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:17,190
of conferences and usually my colleagues

00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:20,280
from other companies ask me Victor what

00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:23,850
is Drupal because the desi and my visit

00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:28,260
card about Drupal so I think the Drupal

00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:32,960
is not so popular so so I think that we

00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:36,570
need to do more for promote Drupal to

00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:38,640
and to spread information to all well

00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:42,500
above the technology about this

00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:46,560
framework and in this case we will have

00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:49,140
more guys that sink and understand the

00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:53,220
technology and we will have more members

00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:57,020
so i think is the main goal and we do it

00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:59,430
in ukraine we support here a lot of

00:25:57,020 --> 00:26:03,170
initiatives and we are supported and i

00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:06,510
think that it's very nice to proper do

00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:10,530
promotion big promotion company a big

00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:13,380
promotion yeah i campaigned on campaigns

00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:17,130
in world and we will have a very good

00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:18,960
results in this case that's all awesome

00:26:17,130 --> 00:26:23,570
I think we may miss you hear from

00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:25,740
everyone on that did I miss anyone ok

00:26:23,570 --> 00:26:26,940
yeah I want to thank you all for those

00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:29,190
answers I think those are all really

00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:30,900
valid answers you know increasing

00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:33,000
participation really making it easier

00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:38,100
for people to participate globally

00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:39,810
marketing and promoting Drupal figuring

00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:42,090
out how to how to structure leadership

00:26:39,810 --> 00:26:42,790
in the project increasing participate of

00:26:42,090 --> 00:26:44,170
already set

00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:45,400
recent participation I wrote that down

00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:47,710
twice that's how important i thought it

00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:49,870
was apparently you know these are all

00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:51,820
really these are all the kinds of issues

00:26:49,870 --> 00:26:55,630
that we that we struggle with so thanks

00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:57,220
for thinking so hard about them um also

00:26:55,630 --> 00:26:58,900
you guys are really good at keeping your

00:26:57,220 --> 00:27:01,750
answers to 90 seconds I just want to say

00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:04,810
um so I want to move on to another

00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:10,420
question and as I mentioned at the top

00:27:04,810 --> 00:27:12,760
of the session we have we have this is a

00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:14,170
two year term that you get to serve and

00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:15,870
we just recently restructured that

00:27:14,170 --> 00:27:19,210
because we wanted to make sure that

00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:21,130
folks had enough time on the board to

00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:23,020
really feel like they accomplished

00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:26,290
something it takes a little while to

00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:27,760
work your way you know work your way

00:27:26,290 --> 00:27:29,740
into a group that is already been

00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:31,870
working together figure out how they

00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:34,600
work bring your ideas and see them

00:27:31,870 --> 00:27:36,910
through so it's two years that you get

00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:38,650
and I'm curious for each of you what

00:27:36,910 --> 00:27:40,000
would you like to be able what would you

00:27:38,650 --> 00:27:44,260
like to say that you've been able to

00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:46,180
accomplish at the end of your term or to

00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:50,190
put that question a different way what

00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:50,190
does a successful term look like to you

00:27:51,930 --> 00:27:59,530
so I guess I'll go again first honey if

00:27:56,590 --> 00:28:01,420
I do yeah yeah that's me sorry oh yeah

00:27:59,530 --> 00:28:05,770
I'll to eat so much it's me honey okay

00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:10,510
great um yeah sorry but don't worry um

00:28:05,770 --> 00:28:12,490
from me from me uh look I believe I'm

00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:15,550
seeing I'm witnessing a massive

00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:18,100
explosion in open source not just in my

00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:21,060
country in India but everywhere else

00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:25,120
we're open source is becoming a massive

00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:30,120
tool to solve problems and Drupal is a

00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:34,000
great platform for building solutions

00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:35,770
for me as as part of let's say five was

00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:40,810
part of the people Association member i

00:28:35,770 --> 00:28:43,720
would love to get a look in my own well

00:28:40,810 --> 00:28:47,830
starting with my own country government

00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:50,320
education that started on a grassroots

00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:52,690
level where people are dotting Drupal

00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:56,530
but Drupal distributions coming out of

00:28:52,690 --> 00:29:00,010
the way drupal becoming a mainstream war

00:28:56,530 --> 00:29:01,990
like Google is almost in two years yeah

00:29:00,010 --> 00:29:05,140
well you might think it's kind of a joke

00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:08,140
but it's not it can happen I think

00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:11,650
Drupal and the platform can be a

00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:14,800
powerful platform for people to be able

00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:17,800
to empower themselves and I think that

00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:19,990
to me would be a really powerful thing

00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:22,810
to reach out to people who and I also

00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:25,930
contribute for me contribution is a very

00:29:22,810 --> 00:29:30,270
big deal contributing back to the Drupal

00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:33,760
project the project can only survive if

00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:37,540
people contribute and contribute doesn't

00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:42,040
mean you write code contribute means you

00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:45,070
do whatever you can to evangelize do to

00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:48,250
get people to know what the community is

00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:50,560
all about to have meetups to have

00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:53,800
whatever and just let to know let me

00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:57,310
know this it's a great project we part

00:29:53,800 --> 00:30:03,310
of for me that is a fantastic

00:29:57,310 --> 00:30:09,640
contribution thanks honey others want to

00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:12,490
tackle that one sure this is addy um I

00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:15,610
would say I mean at the end of of two

00:30:12,490 --> 00:30:19,750
years I would like to have you know a

00:30:15,610 --> 00:30:22,750
tangible thing I'm a I'm a big person

00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:26,250
about documentation and so for me

00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:28,810
actually just even documenting community

00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:31,120
processes and structures so that they

00:30:28,810 --> 00:30:33,100
are more discoverable and understandable

00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:34,350
to facilitate the discussions and

00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:38,140
conversations around them would be

00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:41,380
really awesome thing to see and I would

00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:45,100
really like to see some brainstorming

00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:48,490
and implementation of actual onboarding

00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:51,220
improvements be that through changes to

00:30:48,490 --> 00:30:53,470
drupal org that improves the onboarding

00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:55,870
process for someone who's knew coming

00:30:53,470 --> 00:31:00,580
into the community particularly ones

00:30:55,870 --> 00:31:03,190
that encourage diversity or through

00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:06,450
having documentation and more starter

00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:09,389
packs for events in terms of how they

00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:11,909
can use processes and

00:31:09,389 --> 00:31:13,469
and reach out from our diversity for the

00:31:11,909 --> 00:31:15,389
community through through personal

00:31:13,469 --> 00:31:17,369
events so those would probably be some

00:31:15,389 --> 00:31:23,369
of my big things that I would like to

00:31:17,369 --> 00:31:28,320
check the box off on no small feat cycle

00:31:23,369 --> 00:31:32,639
hey Michael hey um I go to a lot of

00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:34,559
events and is it now in Europe or in the

00:31:32,639 --> 00:31:36,779
US and ice especially from event

00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:38,879
organizers which we heard before are

00:31:36,779 --> 00:31:41,669
really important for community

00:31:38,879 --> 00:31:43,799
especially in Europe and I feel a lot of

00:31:41,669 --> 00:31:46,229
event organizers saying that they don't

00:31:43,799 --> 00:31:49,739
really feel supported by the triple

00:31:46,229 --> 00:31:51,929
association and which most probably has

00:31:49,739 --> 00:31:53,849
a lot of different reasons and I don't

00:31:51,929 --> 00:31:56,219
want to tell all of them but I think

00:31:53,849 --> 00:31:59,070
what I would really like to see is like

00:31:56,219 --> 00:32:01,950
in two years if I walk to event

00:31:59,070 --> 00:32:06,450
organizers in Europe or in other

00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:08,459
emerging em continents right now like we

00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:10,529
have more in Latin America there is most

00:32:08,459 --> 00:32:12,959
of happening Africa and Asia everywhere

00:32:10,529 --> 00:32:15,179
more and more events happen and then it

00:32:12,959 --> 00:32:18,299
support I would like to see in two years

00:32:15,179 --> 00:32:20,570
that they say they really know how the

00:32:18,299 --> 00:32:24,570
drupal association support with them and

00:32:20,570 --> 00:32:26,879
that they also say that they that they

00:32:24,570 --> 00:32:29,399
really value the support they got and

00:32:26,879 --> 00:32:32,129
say that with that support they could do

00:32:29,399 --> 00:32:35,009
more they usually couldn't do and that's

00:32:32,129 --> 00:32:37,529
one thing that I currently don't see it

00:32:35,009 --> 00:32:39,839
happening so much and if i can say after

00:32:37,529 --> 00:32:42,690
two years with my help and understanding

00:32:39,839 --> 00:32:45,119
also what what these people need and how

00:32:42,690 --> 00:32:49,109
can we as the drupal association board

00:32:45,119 --> 00:32:51,690
support via the staff and these events

00:32:49,109 --> 00:32:53,190
if they say yes we really like it and we

00:32:51,690 --> 00:32:55,109
could do more that we couldn't do that's

00:32:53,190 --> 00:33:00,599
one thing i would really like to see off

00:32:55,109 --> 00:33:03,839
two years ok this is this is laura

00:33:00,599 --> 00:33:06,779
mercier engine room Costa Rica my

00:33:03,839 --> 00:33:08,429
suggestion decatur's will be and how to

00:33:06,779 --> 00:33:10,499
establish duple communities in

00:33:08,429 --> 00:33:13,139
developing countries like Chile latin

00:33:10,499 --> 00:33:15,989
america nigeria in africa ambien in

00:33:13,139 --> 00:33:18,149
ashes this is kind of samples when I'm

00:33:15,989 --> 00:33:21,839
what i mean by established communities

00:33:18,149 --> 00:33:22,720
is to have them to establish group on

00:33:21,839 --> 00:33:25,990
rafts to share

00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:29,830
the knowledge 22 chorus people to

00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:32,080
contribute koken a documentation and the

00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:35,289
second one will be enabled these

00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:38,140
communities to how to create his own

00:33:35,289 --> 00:33:41,049
resources in modern language so my point

00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:44,080
of view is if we help them to create a

00:33:41,049 --> 00:33:47,230
documentation in inch in Chinese in

00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:52,750
Hindi in intro hello in Spanish we will

00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:58,679
have an an an exploding a system in

00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:58,679
terms of of contribution for these areas

00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:13,080
great uh Victor or Carlos this is a very

00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:16,179
good out that are great yep yeah right

00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:20,200
is the line okay to talk yeah go for it

00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:22,780
yeah okay okay in fact two years seems a

00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:26,679
long time where it's also really a short

00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:29,580
time so i would definitely focus on four

00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:32,490
points I would say that defines success

00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:36,040
for me at the end of these for two years

00:34:32,490 --> 00:34:39,010
the first goal I have to achieve I would

00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:43,089
say is that the community that is far

00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:45,609
more in interaction this interaction I'm

00:34:43,089 --> 00:34:50,159
not talking about you know just males

00:34:45,609 --> 00:34:53,470
and tweets and all online issues but

00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:57,670
other than that trying to get people

00:34:53,470 --> 00:35:02,770
together with small more i would say

00:34:57,670 --> 00:35:04,720
international events i dream of all so

00:35:02,770 --> 00:35:06,970
that i know that there are some task

00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:09,190
forces like that but I dream of three

00:35:06,970 --> 00:35:12,400
separate task forces that will be in

00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:14,530
operation one in documentation one on

00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:18,520
training and one on in turn is a shin

00:35:14,530 --> 00:35:21,280
and the goal of these three task force's

00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:23,410
I would say is just to create a

00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:27,550
documentation or a training or an

00:35:23,410 --> 00:35:30,940
internalization street that is you can

00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:34,270
only achieve when you pay for it so it

00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:36,310
should be that good and drupal should be

00:35:34,270 --> 00:35:39,220
the base for free

00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:44,470
getting huge internal internalized

00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:47,710
projects my third point is is of course

00:35:44,470 --> 00:35:51,070
to raise some funds to secure the future

00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:54,520
of this project and this is closely

00:35:51,070 --> 00:35:57,340
related to my fourth wall which I have

00:35:54,520 --> 00:36:00,310
to make this community also working for

00:35:57,340 --> 00:36:02,770
a social cause if we can make the

00:36:00,310 --> 00:36:05,760
community work for open source software

00:36:02,770 --> 00:36:09,340
plus a social cause I would definitely

00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:12,160
be a I would be one hundred percent sure

00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:18,040
that we can raise funds more easier

00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:22,480
thank you hey um can I come in here you

00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:29,800
betcha hello let's go to Adam and then I

00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:33,100
think we also saw us okay so I mean for

00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:35,980
me I think the it it's kind of a

00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:37,030
successful term is is a bit different I

00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:40,180
think to the one thing I'd like to

00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:42,240
achieve or accomplish but in terms of a

00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:45,160
successful term I hope it would be about

00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:46,960
helping the the drupal association to

00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:48,760
grow the community in the way that in

00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:50,890
the last few years particularly it's

00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:53,050
really started to do a huge scale in

00:36:50,890 --> 00:36:54,670
terms of looking at like staff members

00:36:53,050 --> 00:36:56,230
the types of projects that are out there

00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:58,510
the amount of funding which is going

00:36:56,230 --> 00:37:01,140
directly to community members to to

00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:03,430
contribute them to grow the project

00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:04,780
tangibly what I'd really like to see and

00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:05,860
it fits into what a number of people

00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:08,170
have talked about is this kind of

00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:10,420
internationalisation but it's actually

00:37:08,170 --> 00:37:12,610
that I know there's a there's an office

00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:15,310
now in in Europe but actually that the

00:37:12,610 --> 00:37:17,590
the drupal association opens offices

00:37:15,310 --> 00:37:20,290
tangibly with people inside that can

00:37:17,590 --> 00:37:22,600
offer on the ground support and staff to

00:37:20,290 --> 00:37:25,810
two different regions of the world I

00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:27,700
still think while well again great

00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:30,520
strides have been made that the drupal

00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:32,710
association has a huge obvious focus in

00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:34,510
in the USA and i think bringing that

00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:37,180
outside will only strengthen the

00:37:34,510 --> 00:37:39,280
association but also give a lot more

00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:41,440
support to two people and majorly

00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:45,010
visibility in in the various different

00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:47,380
regions yeah so so I think actually

00:37:45,010 --> 00:37:49,750
having offices with staff members when

00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:50,140
we have 20 odd stuff in the USA I think

00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:52,180
it's time

00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:54,760
we had five in Europe five in South

00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:58,230
America etc etc we really build this is

00:37:54,760 --> 00:38:02,170
a visible association across the world I

00:37:58,230 --> 00:38:04,660
love that Adam and I totally volunteer

00:38:02,170 --> 00:38:10,329
to staff the European office myself um

00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:12,220
does it count if I'm American we

00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:16,299
actually we actually do have to staff in

00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:19,329
Europe we have a developer Oliver who

00:38:16,299 --> 00:38:21,309
lives in Wales and our good friend

00:38:19,329 --> 00:38:24,519
Tatiana who is the product manager for

00:38:21,309 --> 00:38:26,410
drupal org she is from the Ukraine but

00:38:24,519 --> 00:38:28,269
this week we just actually just helped

00:38:26,410 --> 00:38:32,079
her get a visa to do her work out of the

00:38:28,269 --> 00:38:33,309
UK as well so good but we're weird I

00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:34,630
totally hear you know there's definitely

00:38:33,309 --> 00:38:39,609
more work to be done I just want to

00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:42,910
whoop me if I Madonna yeah ok yeah it's

00:38:39,609 --> 00:38:46,299
sunny again Holly you know what Adams

00:38:42,910 --> 00:38:47,799
saying is fantastic I mean and and what

00:38:46,299 --> 00:38:50,740
I don't sitting in what people have said

00:38:47,799 --> 00:38:53,710
about internationalization of Drupal

00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:57,220
that's very important isn't it it's

00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:59,200
about it's not and North American I'll

00:38:57,220 --> 00:39:02,950
actually interestingly if a build well

00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:05,430
it's it's emergent and and and why are

00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:08,680
we so focused around being just English

00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:10,059
it should be this this conversation

00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:12,700
should we had in multiple languages

00:39:10,059 --> 00:39:13,990
naked totally totally agree with you

00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:15,460
guys totally agree with you guys I

00:39:13,990 --> 00:39:16,750
didn't want to undermine Adams point but

00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:18,940
I did want to just make sure that we

00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:21,279
knew that we definitely at the

00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:24,160
Association take that seriously and

00:39:21,279 --> 00:39:27,369
happen have been working on it a bit as

00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:29,380
we can so but I think we still have both

00:39:27,369 --> 00:39:33,430
Carlos and Victor who's not here respond

00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:36,250
to this one okay um this is carlos

00:39:33,430 --> 00:39:38,230
ospina so I've been listening to

00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:40,839
everybody and I think we all agree that

00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:43,529
you know expanding the contributions

00:39:40,839 --> 00:39:48,940
whether it's called project

00:39:43,529 --> 00:39:51,579
documentation etc is important we talk

00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:54,190
about the leadership trainings the

00:39:51,579 --> 00:39:55,569
internationalization and that's

00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:58,960
something I see and at the end of the

00:39:55,569 --> 00:40:00,940
two years being strengthened with my

00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:02,829
help something that I would like to see

00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:03,410
also is one of the reasons that are

00:40:02,829 --> 00:40:06,890
brought me

00:40:03,410 --> 00:40:09,680
the project is that will leave in an

00:40:06,890 --> 00:40:12,380
open source project is at Lisa Drupal is

00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:15,319
a community in a project that has a

00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:19,849
strong business our point of view if

00:40:15,319 --> 00:40:21,740
that's the word where companies can

00:40:19,849 --> 00:40:24,980
support the project and we have never

00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:26,869
gone to the other side where the project

00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:28,670
gets close or something like that I

00:40:26,869 --> 00:40:31,250
think we need to be keep working on that

00:40:28,670 --> 00:40:33,650
there has been a lot of effort going

00:40:31,250 --> 00:40:39,079
this way we're talking about the jobs da

00:40:33,650 --> 00:40:41,750
Drupal or the initiatives that driz what

00:40:39,079 --> 00:40:45,140
we're talking was talking in Austin

00:40:41,750 --> 00:40:46,400
about maybe recognizing companies etc I

00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:50,780
think that's something that we need to

00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:53,059
work on how to enforce the business part

00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:56,150
without hinder the community part in

00:40:53,059 --> 00:40:57,799
that way we can have the funds and the

00:40:56,150 --> 00:41:01,520
support to do everything that we've been

00:40:57,799 --> 00:41:04,730
talking so far right that's what I will

00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:09,160
really like to be doing or see at the

00:41:04,730 --> 00:41:09,160
end of the two years great thank you

00:41:09,369 --> 00:41:15,319
awesome and Victor are you still with us

00:41:11,529 --> 00:41:21,410

00:41:15,319 --> 00:41:22,940
to that question yes well so yeah it's

00:41:21,410 --> 00:41:25,579

to talk i am drew / as i told her i am

00:41:25,579 --> 00:41:35,660
drupal evangelist and my goal would be

00:41:29,809 --> 00:41:38,770
to promote Drupal and for example to a

00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:41,210
very good result if we could double

00:41:38,770 --> 00:41:45,020
double the number of the park users

00:41:41,210 --> 00:41:48,589
during 3 years and big goal to promote

00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:50,720
Drupal to Solomon everybody now what is

00:41:48,589 --> 00:41:53,569
triple everybody you know now what is

00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:59,299
windows yeah everybody should know what

00:41:53,569 --> 00:42:07,660
is Drupal so this is the goal that eyes

00:41:59,299 --> 00:42:07,660
here yeah that's all hello

00:42:13,970 --> 00:42:21,780
do we lose Holly your green coconut I

00:42:19,109 --> 00:42:25,350
was really funny he's still there moly

00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:27,000
okay so let's say on this international

00:42:25,350 --> 00:42:28,830
theme because my hair's so much passion

00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:31,310
around it and I have a couple of

00:42:28,830 --> 00:42:36,540
questions in the queue related to it um

00:42:31,310 --> 00:42:38,250
so you know we've talked about we talked

00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:40,109
about the Association needing to be more

00:42:38,250 --> 00:42:41,940
international to make connections with

00:42:40,109 --> 00:42:45,480
community leaders for organizing events

00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:48,630
around the world I you know we all think

00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:50,550
that's really important and there are a

00:42:48,630 --> 00:42:53,760
lot of ways that we could go about that

00:42:50,550 --> 00:42:56,520
work so I just wanted to put out to you

00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:58,859
guys if the organization if the

00:42:56,520 --> 00:43:01,790
Association were really doing this work

00:42:58,859 --> 00:43:04,609
well if we were a truly international

00:43:01,790 --> 00:43:07,800
organization what would that look like

00:43:04,609 --> 00:43:09,780
how would we connect with the community

00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:11,880
leaders that are out there and I think

00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:14,670
also more importantly how would we

00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:17,760
connect with some of the local and

00:43:14,670 --> 00:43:19,830
regional leadership teams that have

00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:20,730
already been doing awesome stuff right

00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:23,850
because we don't want to come in and

00:43:20,730 --> 00:43:26,070
step on their toes so how do we do this

00:43:23,850 --> 00:43:29,010
in a collaborative way so that we are

00:43:26,070 --> 00:43:30,390
working with some of the the leaders

00:43:29,010 --> 00:43:32,850
that are already there on the ground

00:43:30,390 --> 00:43:35,310
doing great work and we're supporting

00:43:32,850 --> 00:43:42,450
them but not stepping on their toes that

00:43:35,310 --> 00:43:44,369
make sense yep so Holly uh well da has

00:43:42,450 --> 00:43:47,430
been doing fantastic work with the

00:43:44,369 --> 00:43:50,480
Indian teams in the last few months

00:43:47,430 --> 00:43:57,810
we've had great camps as ani again I'm

00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:59,910
Olivia yeah sorry oops and i think the

00:43:57,810 --> 00:44:03,840
drupal association has been fantastic in

00:43:59,910 --> 00:44:08,400
terms of reaching out to us india is a

00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:11,190
huge traffic not traffic but in terms of

00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:15,330
developers and well not so much

00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:20,820
contribution but what we missed though

00:44:15,330 --> 00:44:21,950
is is for example I think Megan knows

00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:25,050
about it

00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:28,710
2011 please came to India and it was a

00:44:25,050 --> 00:44:30,770
watershed it changed the entire scope of

00:44:28,710 --> 00:44:32,730
Jerusalem India for that one moment

00:44:30,770 --> 00:44:36,090
there were three different camps

00:44:32,730 --> 00:44:38,910
happening that in that year me 15 and

00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:43,110
now we are seeing 600 plus people in our

00:44:38,910 --> 00:44:45,660
camps what ripple Association could do

00:44:43,110 --> 00:44:48,860
is certainly help us with initiatives

00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:53,850
that we are now initiating with students

00:44:48,860 --> 00:44:55,470
with government and I think I don't know

00:44:53,850 --> 00:44:57,600
if I should introduce that but yeah

00:44:55,470 --> 00:45:01,050
triple Khan we've been planned in India

00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:03,630
so that should certainly help but one

00:45:01,050 --> 00:45:06,060
thing that is still missing is still

00:45:03,630 --> 00:45:10,530
people feel there is no representation

00:45:06,060 --> 00:45:18,120
of india in duple association in drupal

00:45:10,530 --> 00:45:19,920
so I only Michael here and I think that

00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:22,910
or I would like to see the drupal

00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:25,110
association connecting people and

00:45:22,910 --> 00:45:28,140
connecting people in terms of just

00:45:25,110 --> 00:45:31,080
telling or knowing what the issues in

00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:34,140
the local communities are and bringing

00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:36,420
them on a global scale means that if

00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:39,510
somebody in Switzerland has the same

00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:42,650
problem as in India whatever it is is it

00:45:39,510 --> 00:45:45,330
onboarding people is it expand

00:45:42,650 --> 00:45:47,370
organizing events or whatever if we have

00:45:45,330 --> 00:45:49,560
the same issues we should be brought

00:45:47,370 --> 00:45:52,590
together and the problem I see right now

00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:55,050
this doesn't happen I don't know what

00:45:52,590 --> 00:45:57,510
other communities local community issues

00:45:55,050 --> 00:46:00,270
but the drupal association candy the

00:45:57,510 --> 00:46:02,670
possibility for us to get to know each

00:46:00,270 --> 00:46:04,770
other better and the tribulation

00:46:02,670 --> 00:46:08,070
listening to us how that actually works

00:46:04,770 --> 00:46:10,170
I don't know maybe it is a month meeting

00:46:08,070 --> 00:46:12,210
with leaders of each local community

00:46:10,170 --> 00:46:14,940
that inside of the dribble associations

00:46:12,210 --> 00:46:16,860
on what meets with leaders and led to

00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:19,920
them and talk to them and connects

00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:22,200
people I think we don't need specific

00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:24,240
health by the VA we need help to help

00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:27,480
ourselves and that is through

00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:29,550
communication through and telling each

00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:32,010
other and connecting people and not

00:46:29,550 --> 00:46:34,620
specifically on where for example it

00:46:32,010 --> 00:46:35,490
happens and so we needed cons and the

00:46:34,620 --> 00:46:37,500
local communities

00:46:35,490 --> 00:46:40,320
cuz I think it can also happen outside

00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:42,690
of that and telling each other hey these

00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:44,910
other community has the same issue why

00:46:42,690 --> 00:46:50,430
don't you talk together and solve the

00:46:44,910 --> 00:46:53,990
problem to guess I just want to say here

00:46:50,430 --> 00:46:59,100
I don't know what Michael just said yeah

00:46:53,990 --> 00:47:00,840
absolutely um yeah I think I mean

00:46:59,100 --> 00:47:02,550
similar to I think connecting people is

00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:04,369
really important I think also the

00:47:02,550 --> 00:47:07,350
opposite is this is adam by the way you

00:47:04,369 --> 00:47:09,420
and this is also the opposite is also

00:47:07,350 --> 00:47:11,160
really important that we don't assume

00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:12,270
one issue happening in one place is

00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:14,130
there for the same issue that's

00:47:12,270 --> 00:47:16,590
happening in another and i think the

00:47:14,130 --> 00:47:18,480
biggest way the the da King can really

00:47:16,590 --> 00:47:20,520
do this is by integrating into the

00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:22,500
communities or becoming part of the

00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:24,360
communities or even better people in the

00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:26,970
communities becoming part of the DA and

00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:28,980
I think that that could be opening of

00:47:26,970 --> 00:47:31,680
the DA board membership in a way that

00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:34,260
there's representation almost almost

00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:37,320
like false representation and but maybe

00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:39,390
not in the in the that would take time

00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:41,130
obviously in terms of the stuff i think

00:47:39,390 --> 00:47:42,660
it's again important similar to saying

00:47:41,130 --> 00:47:44,869
having regional offices that you

00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:47,430
actually have people not people who

00:47:44,869 --> 00:47:51,420
represent the region but people who come

00:47:47,430 --> 00:47:54,180
from the region or or live there and I

00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:56,880
think that it's about kind of closing

00:47:54,180 --> 00:47:58,050
any gap not the day I just great job

00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:59,730
already and integrating into the

00:47:58,050 --> 00:48:03,060
communities but but but closing that gap

00:47:59,730 --> 00:48:06,630
culturally language it through events

00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:08,280
etc on the local levels of going to

00:48:06,630 --> 00:48:15,450
those regions and being being seen in

00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:19,590
visible in those regions anyone else

00:48:15,450 --> 00:48:26,430
would this is karla Faustina um be me me

00:48:19,590 --> 00:48:28,350
me okay I think that something that we

00:48:26,430 --> 00:48:31,070
started doing we started doing it in

00:48:28,350 --> 00:48:34,380
drupalcon Latin American and that was a

00:48:31,070 --> 00:48:36,150
for me a really good show of how we can

00:48:34,380 --> 00:48:38,790
work together with the community the

00:48:36,150 --> 00:48:41,550
local community have something amazing

00:48:38,790 --> 00:48:45,750
like having over a hundred sprinters in

00:48:41,550 --> 00:48:49,110
a event with 260 people which was

00:48:45,750 --> 00:48:52,470
amazing and we need to keep working

00:48:49,110 --> 00:48:55,290
working with people locally and and

00:48:52,470 --> 00:48:59,390
using the drupal association power and i

00:48:55,290 --> 00:49:03,390
quote unquote power be like the central

00:48:59,390 --> 00:49:07,830
association that can help with grants

00:49:03,390 --> 00:49:10,560
and involvement and organization to the

00:49:07,830 --> 00:49:12,660
local people that will be amazing and

00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:16,560
adele what proved to be very successful

00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:19,800
in report on latin america and expand

00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:23,760
that to local camps local f/4g td's

00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:25,530
death day that's everything that came

00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:27,600
out from the poker night in America for

00:49:25,530 --> 00:49:29,040
example so I'm sure we're gonna count

00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:32,400
with a drupal association and that's

00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:34,290
part of my goal to help get that support

00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:36,830
going to Latin America when those events

00:49:34,290 --> 00:49:39,930
go a star and everywhere in the world

00:49:36,830 --> 00:49:42,410
offices I'm not so sure and in terms of

00:49:39,930 --> 00:49:46,320
languages I think we did a good first I

00:49:42,410 --> 00:49:48,000
start by if I don't know if you're going

00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:51,180
nose but report conduct in America was

00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:52,830
the first trilingual drupalcon ever we

00:49:51,180 --> 00:49:56,490
had three languages going on with

00:49:52,830 --> 00:49:59,760
simultaneous translation and i doing

00:49:56,490 --> 00:50:05,610
that way we can help expand the

00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:10,860
community and my tiny fellow this is

00:50:05,610 --> 00:50:14,130
alter again hey helper uh I I just

00:50:10,860 --> 00:50:16,280
listened to my mates and every one of

00:50:14,130 --> 00:50:18,810
them every single one of them has really

00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:21,780
pointed out the importance of our

00:50:18,810 --> 00:50:25,110
community and I guess right at the

00:50:21,780 --> 00:50:26,930
moment we are just on a good track to

00:50:25,110 --> 00:50:29,340
achieve what we require is

00:50:26,930 --> 00:50:32,340
internalization and representation all

00:50:29,340 --> 00:50:35,370
around the world because as you said we

00:50:32,340 --> 00:50:37,620
are 24 candidates from 14 different

00:50:35,370 --> 00:50:40,350
countries so that's really

00:50:37,620 --> 00:50:43,470
internalization of the project i would

00:50:40,350 --> 00:50:45,450
say that we have to put more power on

00:50:43,470 --> 00:50:49,320
the democratization of the community

00:50:45,450 --> 00:50:52,140
which i can say that this election is a

00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:55,460
good way to start so we need to find

00:50:52,140 --> 00:50:58,920
ways to identify the local leaders

00:50:55,460 --> 00:51:01,410
because in some cases especially for

00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:02,880
example in turkey there are people who

00:51:01,410 --> 00:51:05,009
know groupon and who

00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:08,309
good stuff about Drupal but they are not

00:51:05,009 --> 00:51:11,329
known by the association so I would say

00:51:08,309 --> 00:51:15,750
that we should organize a committee

00:51:11,329 --> 00:51:20,509
under the association's realization to

00:51:15,750 --> 00:51:23,640
create people of the local i would say

00:51:20,509 --> 00:51:26,940
origin to come together and talk about

00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:30,210
the problems and things together this

00:51:26,940 --> 00:51:32,339
may be online conferences or as my

00:51:30,210 --> 00:51:35,450
colleagues just pointed out we can also

00:51:32,339 --> 00:51:38,869
start trying more small internal is a

00:51:35,450 --> 00:51:46,349
internal international i would say

00:51:38,869 --> 00:51:48,420
meetings as well thank you hi this is

00:51:46,349 --> 00:51:51,210
answered a diversion okay as my name

00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:52,799
machine before and about complete

00:51:51,210 --> 00:51:55,140
leaders well the final agreement later

00:51:52,799 --> 00:51:57,960
in a country or rayon is really hard it

00:51:55,140 --> 00:52:00,720
is not free frictions and that could be

00:51:57,960 --> 00:52:01,859
changed tank to time so i want to

00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:03,779
mention about my experience in

00:52:01,859 --> 00:52:05,519
conservation because after five years

00:52:03,779 --> 00:52:07,980
working as volunteer entities about

00:52:05,519 --> 00:52:12,450
drupal we finally decide to create an

00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:15,930
NGO to help us to organize the do panera

00:52:12,450 --> 00:52:19,049
super-dee-duper camps and obviously to

00:52:15,930 --> 00:52:21,539
put a face with more organization to two

00:52:19,049 --> 00:52:23,970
possible sponsor so that helped us to

00:52:21,539 --> 00:52:26,490
about any friction and to tend to avoid

00:52:23,970 --> 00:52:30,000
any possible interests between companies

00:52:26,490 --> 00:52:34,019
so with this new NGO and we call super

00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:36,660
costa rica we use this organization to

00:52:34,019 --> 00:52:38,490
to work each other and also is a

00:52:36,660 --> 00:52:41,130
connection between the local community

00:52:38,490 --> 00:52:43,589
with Drupal community as opposed our

00:52:41,130 --> 00:52:46,980
international community so I really got

00:52:43,589 --> 00:52:49,140
us to create this kind of entities it's

00:52:46,980 --> 00:52:58,289
like duple association in a local

00:52:49,140 --> 00:53:01,109
environment thank you great I think um

00:52:58,289 --> 00:53:04,440
Eddie or Victor do you guys have

00:53:01,109 --> 00:53:06,329
anything you want to add to this yes all

00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:09,180
right back there huh oh by the way uh

00:53:06,329 --> 00:53:15,700
Holly I'd like to add altar honey yes

00:53:09,180 --> 00:53:19,270
honey no re Victor please go ahead

00:53:15,700 --> 00:53:27,520
no problem sister nah you go ahead

00:53:19,270 --> 00:53:32,079
please okay so my idea to provide from

00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:36,339
purple Association some information

00:53:32,079 --> 00:53:39,070
support for organizers of local beat up

00:53:36,339 --> 00:53:42,130
the du pont aux image i'm that some

00:53:39,070 --> 00:53:44,320
simple guy organize local meetup year

00:53:42,130 --> 00:53:45,849
and we know we know that a lot of people

00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:47,980
recognize that maybe despot ups and

00:53:45,849 --> 00:53:50,950
image i added one moment this guy

00:53:47,980 --> 00:53:53,950
received just a mail from group

00:53:50,950 --> 00:53:57,040
association vias thanks guy we know that

00:53:53,950 --> 00:53:59,800
you organize this meetup and we would

00:53:57,040 --> 00:54:05,070
like to tell you thank you it's very big

00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:11,670
push for mmm a motivate this guy do this

00:54:05,070 --> 00:54:16,750
Oh to do this again so I would like to

00:54:11,670 --> 00:54:20,319
provide this support and to show this

00:54:16,750 --> 00:54:22,569
guy that we know about their initiatives

00:54:20,319 --> 00:54:28,329
and I think we will have a very good

00:54:22,569 --> 00:54:32,050
effect thank you paddy anything you want

00:54:28,329 --> 00:54:33,430
to add on to those responses I mean

00:54:32,050 --> 00:54:37,119
honestly I don't think I have anything

00:54:33,430 --> 00:54:42,150
novel to add the other than to I I

00:54:37,119 --> 00:54:46,119
definitely feel that the the DA creating

00:54:42,150 --> 00:54:49,359
in encouraging spaces for communication

00:54:46,119 --> 00:54:53,200
across groups rather than being like a

00:54:49,359 --> 00:54:56,020
central force that comes down per se but

00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:58,300
but being able to create mechanisms and

00:54:56,020 --> 00:55:00,700
create whatever it is that the people

00:54:58,300 --> 00:55:03,099
need to communicate just laterally

00:55:00,700 --> 00:55:05,109
amongst themselves is is definitely

00:55:03,099 --> 00:55:08,950
something that I think is really

00:55:05,109 --> 00:55:11,440
necessary everybody's so scattered and

00:55:08,950 --> 00:55:13,890
it's hard to figure out like how do I in

00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:17,319
Denmark figure out who I would talk to

00:55:13,890 --> 00:55:19,180
in South America without just sort of

00:55:17,319 --> 00:55:20,650
pecking around and starting to see who

00:55:19,180 --> 00:55:22,390
does offense and who should I try and

00:55:20,650 --> 00:55:25,690
contact and feel like if there was more

00:55:22,390 --> 00:55:28,270
of a central organized way to facilitate

00:55:25,690 --> 00:55:29,380
that communication that would have a

00:55:28,270 --> 00:55:30,580
huge impact

00:55:29,380 --> 00:55:33,670
on a lot of different communities

00:55:30,580 --> 00:55:37,660
especially really small ones who feel

00:55:33,670 --> 00:55:39,730
very isolated i'd love to i'd love to

00:55:37,660 --> 00:55:44,500
add to that what Alison Eddie said

00:55:39,730 --> 00:55:46,320
something very very important and the

00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:52,060
drupal association i don't believe is

00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:55,360
the organization that necessarily it is

00:55:52,060 --> 00:55:57,580
about the power of drupal but yes a

00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:59,050
facilitation of Drupal is about the

00:55:57,580 --> 00:56:03,190
community facilitation that's what

00:55:59,050 --> 00:56:06,780
Triple Association acts out it meant a

00:56:03,190 --> 00:56:09,850
mixture it's a boo of Drupal I think and

00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:11,530
what Allie said is very very cool it's

00:56:09,850 --> 00:56:13,390
about how the hell do I get in touch

00:56:11,530 --> 00:56:16,600
with other people right in small

00:56:13,390 --> 00:56:19,780
communities in India well we have very

00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:22,480
large communities here and lots of

00:56:19,780 --> 00:56:24,520
people but yes we face the same problems

00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:27,760
in fact I've spoken with that about

00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:30,250
other people from VA how about opening

00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:32,770
up the API from a triple association

00:56:30,250 --> 00:56:38,130
where we can are you know our own little

00:56:32,770 --> 00:56:40,870
small camps we could share information

00:56:38,130 --> 00:56:43,450
using that information to attract other

00:56:40,870 --> 00:56:47,650
people and they're having a notice in

00:56:43,450 --> 00:56:49,770
IRC channel but other ways to talk to

00:56:47,650 --> 00:56:52,180
each other I think drupal association

00:56:49,770 --> 00:56:55,270
could definitely do that but yes please

00:56:52,180 --> 00:56:58,810
let's not forget google association is a

00:56:55,270 --> 00:57:03,840
finite organization it's not unlimited

00:56:58,810 --> 00:57:03,840
in terms of resources or people write

00:57:03,990 --> 00:57:11,890
that we are that's true um okay well

00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:14,620
listen i want to continue on this theme

00:57:11,890 --> 00:57:16,110
a little bit um and someone in the

00:57:14,620 --> 00:57:21,250
someone on the call wanted to ask

00:57:16,110 --> 00:57:23,920
particularly carlos and enzo about what

00:57:21,250 --> 00:57:26,110
they feel like in in their specific

00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:29,710
community in latin america what they

00:57:26,110 --> 00:57:31,330
need to have happened there to grow

00:57:29,710 --> 00:57:32,680
Drupal adoption and bring in more

00:57:31,330 --> 00:57:36,010
contributors and really make that

00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:37,990
ecosystem flourish and it just when I

00:57:36,010 --> 00:57:40,060
saw that question it reminded me of one

00:57:37,990 --> 00:57:42,250
of the things one of you smartly said

00:57:40,060 --> 00:57:42,880
which was that you know every community

00:57:42,250 --> 00:57:44,440
around the world

00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:45,670
old you know we want to touch all these

00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:46,660
places but we also want to make sure

00:57:45,670 --> 00:57:50,380
that we're doing it in a way that makes

00:57:46,660 --> 00:57:53,950
sense for that for that area right we

00:57:50,380 --> 00:57:57,549
can't treat every contributor the same

00:57:53,950 --> 00:58:00,160
right you guys all work from different

00:57:57,549 --> 00:58:02,710
perspectives so so I wanted to open up

00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:05,740
to everyone you know what is the thing

00:58:02,710 --> 00:58:09,130
where you live in the world what is the

00:58:05,740 --> 00:58:12,220
thing that is unique about your place

00:58:09,130 --> 00:58:15,069
that the drupal association can help to

00:58:12,220 --> 00:58:20,259
encourage your community to flourish

00:58:15,069 --> 00:58:23,470
that question makes sense hopefully

00:58:20,259 --> 00:58:24,400
someone says yes um yeah yeah Holly but

00:58:23,470 --> 00:58:26,829
you know it's going to be very tough

00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:28,599
questions for example you know within

00:58:26,829 --> 00:58:31,089
India itself there's like five different

00:58:28,599 --> 00:58:35,559
different things between the cities

00:58:31,089 --> 00:58:38,650
right like in Bombay I don't know what

00:58:35,559 --> 00:58:43,869
what can I tell you we are already at

00:58:38,650 --> 00:58:47,140
six seven seven people but yes there are

00:58:43,869 --> 00:58:50,769
issues we have local issues in terms of

00:58:47,140 --> 00:58:54,029
people not making into meetups because

00:58:50,769 --> 00:58:56,170
too hard to travel sometimes in Bombay

00:58:54,029 --> 00:58:59,410
what I'd love to hear from Latin America

00:58:56,170 --> 00:59:02,049
mean I'm so intrigued about Bogota and

00:58:59,410 --> 00:59:04,630
what happened over there and and how

00:59:02,049 --> 00:59:07,680
that's planning out I would love to hear

00:59:04,630 --> 00:59:10,420
from somebody from Latin America yeah oh

00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:12,549
this is ani again by the way sorry no

00:59:10,420 --> 00:59:20,579
worries Carlos or or M so do you guys

00:59:12,549 --> 00:59:29,109
want to talk about first but regardless

00:59:20,579 --> 00:59:32,769
well um um um I think we okay sade I

00:59:29,109 --> 00:59:34,720
mean I think the work that we did with

00:59:32,769 --> 00:59:37,630
the pecan Latin America is a proof of

00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:40,119
that um what is important is to

00:59:37,630 --> 00:59:43,630
understand the reality of the community

00:59:40,119 --> 00:59:45,400
where we're going in special in the

00:59:43,630 --> 00:59:49,269
Latin American community one of the

00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:52,930
biggest discussions is um we don't have

00:59:49,269 --> 00:59:55,089
the same I don't know if this is the

00:59:52,930 --> 00:59:56,730
correct expression monetary power than

00:59:55,089 --> 00:59:58,260
we have here in the States

00:59:56,730 --> 01:00:01,560
and that's something that is important

00:59:58,260 --> 01:00:05,790
to understand we have a different

01:00:01,560 --> 01:00:07,830
language so I would just talk the

01:00:05,790 --> 01:00:09,990
experience that we have organizing this

01:00:07,830 --> 01:00:12,420
this this Rupert conduct in America that

01:00:09,990 --> 01:00:17,700
in terms of everybody that I've talked

01:00:12,420 --> 01:00:21,870
to was a huge success is we work with

01:00:17,700 --> 01:00:24,330
local people and so help it were the

01:00:21,870 --> 01:00:26,640
help us with the trainings we have

01:00:24,330 --> 01:00:30,330
symbols everywhere and volunteers every

01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:34,080
word helping us time to identify how to

01:00:30,330 --> 01:00:36,150
do the things right and with the support

01:00:34,080 --> 01:00:39,320
of the drupal association and their

01:00:36,150 --> 01:00:41,670
experience in organization and

01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:43,820
everything that had happened i think we

01:00:41,670 --> 01:00:47,850
can we could reach out to the community

01:00:43,820 --> 01:00:49,950
in a way like i will say it again the

01:00:47,850 --> 01:00:52,470
biggest surprise we had is the sprints

01:00:49,950 --> 01:00:54,840
and remember the code is prints even

01:00:52,470 --> 01:00:57,510
though they're cold springs are not only

01:00:54,840 --> 01:00:59,700
cold is about talking about community

01:00:57,510 --> 01:01:04,980
talking about the project documentation

01:00:59,700 --> 01:01:10,110
etc um they were a big success because

01:01:04,980 --> 01:01:12,650
um what I feel is if you identify what

01:01:10,110 --> 01:01:15,870
makes the community special in this case

01:01:12,650 --> 01:01:24,180
Latin America is a very strong United

01:01:15,870 --> 01:01:26,010
community as a region I mean a world o

01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:27,930
kind of Tears I mean if you go to a

01:01:26,010 --> 01:01:29,640
group work on Costa Rica you will find

01:01:27,930 --> 01:01:31,770
people from everywhere if you go to a

01:01:29,640 --> 01:01:33,990
trooper camp Mexico you will find people

01:01:31,770 --> 01:01:37,050
from everywhere in Latin America Drupal

01:01:33,990 --> 01:01:40,950
pics you have had over 60 people from

01:01:37,050 --> 01:01:42,950
different countries almost Tilikum three

01:01:40,950 --> 01:01:49,140
different countries including Holly

01:01:42,950 --> 01:01:52,280
that's what we met and I think that's

01:01:49,140 --> 01:01:55,910
the way you can help a community by by

01:01:52,280 --> 01:01:59,790
working together with the people that

01:01:55,910 --> 01:02:03,780
can guide you and show you how different

01:01:59,790 --> 01:02:08,790
it is or how similarly this or what will

01:02:03,780 --> 01:02:10,560
fly and what won't fly yeah okay the way

01:02:08,790 --> 01:02:15,570
that I think

01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:17,490
just to think to to mention how I looked

01:02:15,570 --> 01:02:19,740
at super combo the time for me is is

01:02:17,490 --> 01:02:22,020
more every soul than a success what's

01:02:19,740 --> 01:02:24,060
assistance but for me it's a result of a

01:02:22,020 --> 01:02:26,790
several Jeff of working if you check out

01:02:24,060 --> 01:02:29,100
the history in Latin America from Mexico

01:02:26,790 --> 01:02:31,950
to Chile we have around 23 countries and

01:02:29,100 --> 01:02:34,830
we have been working in or at least six

01:02:31,950 --> 01:02:37,950
years in location in different prompts

01:02:34,830 --> 01:02:39,810
it's like it's not that it's not a word

01:02:37,950 --> 01:02:41,520
for one person so there are people

01:02:39,810 --> 01:02:43,500
working in South America in the subject

01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:45,000
of America people working in Brazil

01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:47,040
people working in the northwestern

01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:49,470
America people working in Mexico people

01:02:47,040 --> 01:02:51,570
working in Central America so I think

01:02:49,470 --> 01:02:53,550
the most important piece in the Duke

01:02:51,570 --> 01:02:56,310
Association could be due to try to

01:02:53,550 --> 01:02:59,190
encourage a billion is to try to how

01:02:56,310 --> 01:03:02,790
this block of events to try to engage

01:02:59,190 --> 01:03:05,190
more people and to bring his passion to

01:03:02,790 --> 01:03:08,280
do bus to Drupal as a community because

01:03:05,190 --> 01:03:10,020
if you add some I not saying it's a

01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:13,050
piece a mistake but if you try to create

01:03:10,020 --> 01:03:15,630
a huge Evan per day at the beginning is

01:03:13,050 --> 01:03:19,020
stressful with this assessment but if

01:03:15,630 --> 01:03:21,360
you if you did you potentiate this small

01:03:19,020 --> 01:03:23,850
events in each region or each cottage

01:03:21,360 --> 01:03:27,600
country at them for sure you will have

01:03:23,850 --> 01:03:32,850
you will have patient people in to help

01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:34,830
in the creation of this tangible thank

01:03:32,850 --> 01:03:36,630
you to for for sharing that that

01:03:34,830 --> 01:03:40,950
perspective since we have such a recent

01:03:36,630 --> 01:03:43,080
event there I wonder if folks from from

01:03:40,950 --> 01:03:51,530
elsewhere when I want to address that as

01:03:43,080 --> 01:03:53,490
well I could say something I think I

01:03:51,530 --> 01:03:56,780
think the really important thing when we

01:03:53,490 --> 01:03:59,130
look at so let's say this is adam sorry

01:03:56,780 --> 01:04:02,430
some of them maybe takes that have

01:03:59,130 --> 01:04:03,810
happened in the in the past and and and

01:04:02,430 --> 01:04:06,150
the successes that are happening now I

01:04:03,810 --> 01:04:08,610
think it's been brought up before that

01:04:06,150 --> 01:04:11,070
this asking and working with the

01:04:08,610 --> 01:04:13,530
community in in these areas is really

01:04:11,070 --> 01:04:15,270
the key it's it's about not going in and

01:04:13,530 --> 01:04:17,490
saying this is what you need but saying

01:04:15,270 --> 01:04:19,350
what do you need and I think this is the

01:04:17,490 --> 01:04:23,070
key to any successful kind of

01:04:19,350 --> 01:04:25,250
interventional or exploration of events

01:04:23,070 --> 01:04:25,250
or

01:04:25,500 --> 01:04:32,650
programs in in in other countries but i

01:04:29,530 --> 01:04:34,540
also think one things over all that the

01:04:32,650 --> 01:04:37,540
drupal association we could look at

01:04:34,540 --> 01:04:39,250
would also be the the wider impact of

01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:41,200
the of the work that's being done so

01:04:39,250 --> 01:04:43,660
that it's not just you know we're doing

01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:46,690
a drupalcon in in latin america so how

01:04:43,660 --> 01:04:48,610
many people are we going to get there to

01:04:46,690 --> 01:04:50,410
move away from a kind of numbers game

01:04:48,610 --> 01:04:52,960
but look at the social impact and I mean

01:04:50,410 --> 01:04:55,240
social in the Drupal community wise

01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:59,260
rather than generally speaking but the

01:04:55,240 --> 01:05:01,570
social impact of of being a drupalcon to

01:04:59,260 --> 01:05:04,810
a certain region that the fact that I

01:05:01,570 --> 01:05:06,640
honestly believe you guys will tell me

01:05:04,810 --> 01:05:09,070
more but i honestly believe there'll be

01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:10,690
a ripple an impact in inside latin

01:05:09,070 --> 01:05:12,760
america now because of this drupalcon

01:05:10,690 --> 01:05:16,330
for many years to come i think when it

01:05:12,760 --> 01:05:17,980
moves to when we have a drupalcon in

01:05:16,330 --> 01:05:20,320
india it'll be the same thing and and

01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:22,180
and on you know keep going in that way

01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:23,440
and i think we need to spend a bit of

01:05:22,180 --> 01:05:25,030
time to try and look at the different

01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:27,310
indicators and find the social impact

01:05:25,030 --> 01:05:29,650
the different more kind of qualitative

01:05:27,310 --> 01:05:32,320
impacts that are happening to the

01:05:29,650 --> 01:05:34,240
community to help to help improve that

01:05:32,320 --> 01:05:36,010
as we go to different places but it's

01:05:34,240 --> 01:05:38,410
really important that this is not seen

01:05:36,010 --> 01:05:41,170
it you know that we're not taking the

01:05:38,410 --> 01:05:43,600
the package we made in latin america and

01:05:41,170 --> 01:05:46,030
putting it into Mumbai or wherever it'll

01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:52,270
be in India I think this is the really

01:05:46,030 --> 01:05:54,130
important point to make that's nice i

01:05:52,270 --> 01:05:58,540
can add something to her hello this

01:05:54,130 --> 01:06:00,130
software I can't say about sorry yeah go

01:05:58,540 --> 01:06:02,950
ahead upper and then I'm Carlos hold

01:06:00,130 --> 01:06:05,320
your thought we'll get you okay I

01:06:02,950 --> 01:06:08,020
totally agree with adam and i would like

01:06:05,320 --> 01:06:10,960
to thank him in person because trying to

01:06:08,020 --> 01:06:14,470
make things out work as a package is not

01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:17,170
working in everywhere and in all parts

01:06:14,470 --> 01:06:20,290
of the world so it's really important to

01:06:17,170 --> 01:06:23,170
ask what is required to the community

01:06:20,290 --> 01:06:25,300
the local community and after that we

01:06:23,170 --> 01:06:27,310
can use the expertise of good case

01:06:25,300 --> 01:06:30,070
studies this may include you know the

01:06:27,310 --> 01:06:32,440
structures of events or getting personal

01:06:30,070 --> 01:06:35,500
health from community members but i

01:06:32,440 --> 01:06:37,690
would like to thank again to Adam that

01:06:35,500 --> 01:06:41,110
he indicated we

01:06:37,690 --> 01:06:43,030
need to have solutions locally by asking

01:06:41,110 --> 01:06:51,130
the question what do you need or what's

01:06:43,030 --> 01:06:57,160
wrong with your structure Thanks yes um

01:06:51,130 --> 01:07:00,310
thanks i find to say do not ready yep

01:06:57,160 --> 01:07:01,900
sorry girls okay so very quickly I was

01:07:00,310 --> 01:07:04,600
trying to make it quick it's really hard

01:07:01,900 --> 01:07:06,370
to explain how different was this Drupal

01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:08,190
come from the others I have the

01:07:06,370 --> 01:07:11,080
opportunity to speak with so many people

01:07:08,190 --> 01:07:13,780
here in the states and over there and I

01:07:11,080 --> 01:07:15,760
know I know how it works usually and I

01:07:13,780 --> 01:07:17,890
think they approached more than the

01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:21,070
package is what we have to pay attention

01:07:17,890 --> 01:07:22,930
to and the approach was to reach out to

01:07:21,070 --> 01:07:26,830
the local community this community that

01:07:22,930 --> 01:07:29,650
has been working for 67 years trying to

01:07:26,830 --> 01:07:32,890
create that Latin American community

01:07:29,650 --> 01:07:34,450
that is today really strong and identify

01:07:32,890 --> 01:07:38,010
the problem one of the product that we

01:07:34,450 --> 01:07:41,440
identified is for example a certain

01:07:38,010 --> 01:07:43,330
rejection of Drupal 8 because it we were

01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:46,480
insured it was good for a small

01:07:43,330 --> 01:07:47,710
companies which is mostly what happens

01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:51,220
in that in America we have a small

01:07:47,710 --> 01:07:53,950
companies so i think is as long as we

01:07:51,220 --> 01:07:56,530
understand the local people and the

01:07:53,950 --> 01:07:59,110
success wasn't in numbers I'm sorry name

01:07:56,530 --> 01:08:02,770
numbers but the thing was any number is

01:07:59,110 --> 01:08:04,870
that after we approach the problem that

01:08:02,770 --> 01:08:07,600
we saw are talking with the local

01:08:04,870 --> 01:08:10,960
community we we have a great response

01:08:07,600 --> 01:08:13,720
and and that's what I meant it wasn't a

01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:16,420
package but it was much more the way it

01:08:13,720 --> 01:08:19,510
was done because it was guided by the

01:08:16,420 --> 01:08:21,280
local community the creation of this

01:08:19,510 --> 01:08:25,600
event and I think we can replicate that

01:08:21,280 --> 01:08:27,550
everywhere in India in Asia in Africa if

01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:30,880
we work with the local community and

01:08:27,550 --> 01:08:33,850
understand how do they see the project

01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:35,800
what are the things that they feel are

01:08:33,850 --> 01:08:40,180
lacking in the product and waiting help

01:08:35,800 --> 01:08:44,380
the rest of the world to bring that to

01:08:40,180 --> 01:08:47,950
the table the change can be huge I mean

01:08:44,380 --> 01:08:49,920
we had now like we make we duplicate or

01:08:47,950 --> 01:08:51,700
triplicate the number of contributors

01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:53,830
from Latin America

01:08:51,700 --> 01:08:56,650
adjusting one event and if we keep going

01:08:53,830 --> 01:08:58,180
that way and I know it's gonna happen

01:08:56,650 --> 01:09:00,430
that way because the same people that

01:08:58,180 --> 01:09:02,650
has been working before is ready to work

01:09:00,430 --> 01:09:05,080
forward in the local community and

01:09:02,650 --> 01:09:10,300
hopefully we can give this call from the

01:09:05,080 --> 01:09:15,070
DA we can replicate that approach more

01:09:10,300 --> 01:09:18,460
than that package everywhere make sense

01:09:15,070 --> 01:09:21,730
makes absolutely yeah I think what else

01:09:18,460 --> 01:09:24,820
is saying with this honey is absolutely

01:09:21,730 --> 01:09:27,910
right it's about replication it's about

01:09:24,820 --> 01:09:30,070
learning from where we are at and

01:09:27,910 --> 01:09:32,200
understanding where our strengths are

01:09:30,070 --> 01:09:37,960
the group Association is perfectly

01:09:32,200 --> 01:09:40,180
poised to to basically present all its

01:09:37,960 --> 01:09:41,950
see what are y'all talking about here we

01:09:40,180 --> 01:09:44,740
all talking about hey let's share what

01:09:41,950 --> 01:09:47,020
we what we already know we saying we

01:09:44,740 --> 01:09:49,150
don't miss from this event we learned

01:09:47,020 --> 01:09:52,000
this from that event we're not sharing

01:09:49,150 --> 01:09:54,640
enough perhaps depreciation could be a

01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:56,470
great bridge to bring all these

01:09:54,640 --> 01:09:58,870
committees together and let them talk to

01:09:56,470 --> 01:10:00,430
each other and say hey listen it's not

01:09:58,870 --> 01:10:02,440
what happened here let's what happen

01:10:00,430 --> 01:10:04,210
here and let's learn from this and this

01:10:02,440 --> 01:10:06,970
is what your problems are we had the

01:10:04,210 --> 01:10:09,820
same problem we started this way I think

01:10:06,970 --> 01:10:13,960
that'd be a great idea yes yeah part of

01:10:09,820 --> 01:10:15,880
the depolarisation job okay I want to

01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:19,930
stop and see action I just add something

01:10:15,880 --> 01:10:23,350
again yeah well uh stink removal it's

01:10:19,930 --> 01:10:25,360
helper again I'm I guess that we are

01:10:23,350 --> 01:10:28,240
just looking at the great opportunity

01:10:25,360 --> 01:10:30,610
right now in person because we are

01:10:28,240 --> 01:10:33,970
people around the world and talking

01:10:30,610 --> 01:10:37,600
about a future of the project so i guess

01:10:33,970 --> 01:10:39,720
this kind of election say meetings and

01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:43,930
probably other meetings that the

01:10:39,720 --> 01:10:47,080
association can organize the increase of

01:10:43,930 --> 01:10:50,080
the rate of information exchange between

01:10:47,080 --> 01:10:52,900
local parties i guess this is a great

01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:57,700
opportunity that we are wrong even thank

01:10:52,900 --> 01:10:59,950
you thanks upper get to any other any

01:10:57,700 --> 01:11:02,140
other insight on um you know how to

01:10:59,950 --> 01:11:04,770
address your unique community needs that

01:11:02,140 --> 01:11:04,770
you guys want to share

01:11:05,640 --> 01:11:10,030
okay then I have one final cause

01:11:08,770 --> 01:11:12,010
probably gonna be the final questions

01:11:10,030 --> 01:11:13,060
just judging on the timing so put it out

01:11:12,010 --> 01:11:17,200
there if we have time for something else

01:11:13,060 --> 01:11:20,320
we'll get to it but I just want to share

01:11:17,200 --> 01:11:22,180
with everyone briefly the mission of the

01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:24,610
drupal association it's pretty short and

01:11:22,180 --> 01:11:27,400
simple drupal powers the best of the web

01:11:24,610 --> 01:11:29,260
the drupal association unites a global

01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:32,800
open source community to build and

01:11:29,260 --> 01:11:35,170
promote Drupal and I wanted to ask all

01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:38,560
the candidates what makes that mission

01:11:35,170 --> 01:11:40,960
meaningful to you what is the part that

01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:46,720
really resonates with you I really move

01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:54,340
you to want to act just I'm gonna go

01:11:46,720 --> 01:11:55,990
last hahaha so should I start then

01:11:54,340 --> 01:11:58,690
that's my color motion it's all I got

01:11:55,990 --> 01:12:02,590
for Michael I think I think for me it's

01:11:58,690 --> 01:12:03,880
the Uniting it's we're so many different

01:12:02,590 --> 01:12:06,220
people all over the world in different

01:12:03,880 --> 01:12:08,260
time zones and having different issues

01:12:06,220 --> 01:12:10,000
in different thoughts and I think it's

01:12:08,260 --> 01:12:14,470
the importance of the drupal association

01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:16,750
to unite these and that's for me being

01:12:14,470 --> 01:12:18,550
from europe and seeing and we just heard

01:12:16,750 --> 01:12:22,450
a bit about Latin America and India

01:12:18,550 --> 01:12:24,460
while they're still like trying to to

01:12:22,450 --> 01:12:28,000
form each other in Europe we're actually

01:12:24,460 --> 01:12:30,880
ahead there and there are already ideas

01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:33,130
to build something outside of the drupal

01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:35,770
association because some people in

01:12:33,130 --> 01:12:38,440
Europe believe that they do not feel

01:12:35,770 --> 01:12:40,990
understood by the drupal association and

01:12:38,440 --> 01:12:43,030
I think that's really the interest and

01:12:40,990 --> 01:12:44,800
that's one of the really big that's why

01:12:43,030 --> 01:12:46,930
i said okay i won't try an average

01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:50,460
showing through association board as a

01:12:46,930 --> 01:12:54,670
European person to bring in the European

01:12:50,460 --> 01:12:56,890
mindset or European ways of thinking how

01:12:54,670 --> 01:12:59,920
do we interact in the local communities

01:12:56,890 --> 01:13:02,650
and because the mission is to unite and

01:12:59,920 --> 01:13:05,890
I think we can only do that if the board

01:13:02,650 --> 01:13:09,220
also consists of United people of all

01:13:05,890 --> 01:13:11,830
over the world and definitely as we just

01:13:09,220 --> 01:13:14,500
heard before or use whatever we learn

01:13:11,830 --> 01:13:16,750
how we can fix these issues we have

01:13:14,500 --> 01:13:18,710
right now in Europe bring them to the

01:13:16,750 --> 01:13:20,690
other continents prevent

01:13:18,710 --> 01:13:23,750
doing them or if they also happen know

01:13:20,690 --> 01:13:26,210
how we can tackle them and the results

01:13:23,750 --> 01:13:27,620
then that's why i said okay i really

01:13:26,210 --> 01:13:33,739
want to do that because I think we

01:13:27,620 --> 01:13:38,630
should be one united group great who

01:13:33,739 --> 01:13:40,700
else wants to tackle that question it

01:13:38,630 --> 01:13:42,830
says addy I have a feeling a lot of us

01:13:40,700 --> 01:13:47,090
are going to zero in on the Uniting and

01:13:42,830 --> 01:13:51,200
the global given the conversations that

01:13:47,090 --> 01:13:54,410
we've already had this evening and I

01:13:51,200 --> 01:13:56,600
yeah I mean for me it's about the the

01:13:54,410 --> 01:13:59,900
building of bridges and that the the

01:13:56,600 --> 01:14:03,920
Association has resources to help build

01:13:59,900 --> 01:14:06,020
those bridges and to be able to perhaps

01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:07,850
take a step back and have a view to be

01:14:06,020 --> 01:14:10,040
able to connect things that that maybe

01:14:07,850 --> 01:14:12,950
people closer to things can't can't see

01:14:10,040 --> 01:14:16,310
or don't have the resources to do and so

01:14:12,950 --> 01:14:19,010
for me that's like all of the things i

01:14:16,310 --> 01:14:23,239
want to do is to be able to bridge those

01:14:19,010 --> 01:14:25,930
people together and to build bridges to

01:14:23,239 --> 01:14:28,190
the Drupal community not just within it

01:14:25,930 --> 01:14:30,290
there are a lot of people who are on the

01:14:28,190 --> 01:14:34,780
fringes of the Drupal community and just

01:14:30,290 --> 01:14:39,380
see it as this mungus overwhelming thing

01:14:34,780 --> 01:14:42,590
and being able to bring those people in

01:14:39,380 --> 01:14:45,700
to the community and incorporate them

01:14:42,590 --> 01:14:49,460
and have them feel at home and and and

01:14:45,700 --> 01:14:58,450
have the power to to do something

01:14:49,460 --> 01:14:58,450
important is what drives me thanks addy

01:14:59,580 --> 01:15:04,270
other folks want to add on Alyssa's

01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:07,860

same place and we'll have a gift okay so

01:15:36,660 --> 01:15:42,219
yes I'm gonna go with the United part of

01:15:39,430 --> 01:15:46,540
course come on we need to keep together

01:15:42,219 --> 01:15:49,300
working as I united community because

01:15:46,540 --> 01:15:53,080
that's what made rupal grow so much and

01:15:49,300 --> 01:15:55,000
be so professional and that's what I

01:15:53,080 --> 01:15:57,699
like about the project that is

01:15:55,000 --> 01:16:00,699
professional I can go and easily do a

01:15:57,699 --> 01:16:04,860
small simple little page or think about

01:16:00,699 --> 01:16:08,140
whatever without that you can believe or

01:16:04,860 --> 01:16:11,260
imagined so that's what made it the

01:16:08,140 --> 01:16:14,230
project so big is the union of this

01:16:11,260 --> 01:16:17,469
community that I know from so many

01:16:14,230 --> 01:16:19,600
places I I work with the US community I

01:16:17,469 --> 01:16:21,640
work with the Latin American community I

01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:24,850
have really good friends in the European

01:16:21,640 --> 01:16:27,190
Community and I can see how all working

01:16:24,850 --> 01:16:29,560
together we do this but I want to also

01:16:27,190 --> 01:16:31,770
talk about the promotion and that's

01:16:29,560 --> 01:16:34,420
something that Holly knows that I have a

01:16:31,770 --> 01:16:36,370
business vision a little bit more than a

01:16:34,420 --> 01:16:38,710
simple community vision and I think

01:16:36,370 --> 01:16:41,830
that's the big work of the drupal

01:16:38,710 --> 01:16:44,620
association keep us together to grow the

01:16:41,830 --> 01:16:48,280
project and help us promote the project

01:16:44,620 --> 01:16:50,350
in a way that it can be profitable for

01:16:48,280 --> 01:16:52,030
us to be working with roopa because i

01:16:50,350 --> 01:16:54,550
think that is also important i mean it's

01:16:52,030 --> 01:16:57,070
not just being the idealistic part of

01:16:54,550 --> 01:17:00,820
the community but i think we all eat

01:16:57,070 --> 01:17:04,540
from Drupal and we need to keep that

01:17:00,820 --> 01:17:08,410
going on and make sure as the project

01:17:04,540 --> 01:17:11,440
grows the business growth and again

01:17:08,410 --> 01:17:13,240
keeping that balance so delicate and

01:17:11,440 --> 01:17:14,980
wonderful that is the true

01:17:13,240 --> 01:17:19,140
all community which has a beautiful

01:17:14,980 --> 01:17:19,140
balance between businesses and community

01:17:19,380 --> 01:17:29,790
thank you thanks Carlos I let me live on

01:17:27,310 --> 01:17:33,850
those key thanks Victor tough for it

01:17:29,790 --> 01:17:37,270
yeah okay so technology promotion is

01:17:33,850 --> 01:17:40,510
part of my life yeah let me show you

01:17:37,270 --> 01:17:44,140
example these days I am running a

01:17:40,510 --> 01:17:47,530
project of promoting pour imprimer

01:17:44,140 --> 01:17:53,730
profession I am visiting every school in

01:17:47,530 --> 01:17:57,040
my city and speak me as children about

01:17:53,730 --> 01:17:59,530
programmer profession yeah I i would

01:17:57,040 --> 01:18:04,000
like to tell them how nice to be

01:17:59,530 --> 01:18:06,400
programmer so why do i do promotion I i

01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:09,580
like this it is part of my life here and

01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:11,950
life I love this activity so this is

01:18:09,580 --> 01:18:14,860
very interesting for me to also have

01:18:11,950 --> 01:18:19,740
activity as part of the Association

01:18:14,860 --> 01:18:24,960
that's all thank you thanks Victor

01:18:19,740 --> 01:18:29,710
should I go now I'll chatter oh sorry

01:18:24,960 --> 01:18:33,580
don't leave got it right thanks this

01:18:29,710 --> 01:18:36,670
sulfur again and all we know is a Drupal

01:18:33,580 --> 01:18:38,260
open source project but just think of

01:18:36,670 --> 01:18:42,340
this way Drupal is an open source

01:18:38,260 --> 01:18:44,530
project really is there i would say face

01:18:42,340 --> 01:18:46,960
of the light it expresses my lifestyle

01:18:44,530 --> 01:18:49,780
why because its international its

01:18:46,960 --> 01:18:51,730
technological its multicultural and it

01:18:49,780 --> 01:18:54,760
has almost infinite capacities and

01:18:51,730 --> 01:18:56,650
besides that it's open to all so if you

01:18:54,760 --> 01:18:59,950
want to be part of it you can be a part

01:18:56,650 --> 01:19:01,330
of it it's the real work man and if it

01:18:59,950 --> 01:19:04,810
is in the real what we have some

01:19:01,330 --> 01:19:08,320
problems so my main motivation is try to

01:19:04,810 --> 01:19:11,520
is to try to remove the obstacles from

01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:15,780
the community's way to grow bigger and

01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:15,780
reach the future thank you

01:19:20,260 --> 01:19:28,120
excellent Adam did you also want to want

01:19:23,660 --> 01:19:30,710
to go yeah it's pretty hot after it

01:19:28,120 --> 01:19:32,930
after all that I think people picked up

01:19:30,710 --> 01:19:36,080
on it obviously unite is huge but I

01:19:32,930 --> 01:19:40,430
think also I want to pick up on the open

01:19:36,080 --> 01:19:41,930
source side of things I think that in

01:19:40,430 --> 01:19:45,350
terms of the association that often

01:19:41,930 --> 01:19:48,410
people see it as this kind of disk and

01:19:45,350 --> 01:19:50,300
maybe I'm talking from the past but I

01:19:48,410 --> 01:19:53,210
think they're still present and couple

01:19:50,300 --> 01:19:54,890
of people mentioned it this is kind of

01:19:53,210 --> 01:19:56,960
disconnected from the community and not

01:19:54,890 --> 01:19:59,450
as it as it should be another belief as

01:19:56,960 --> 01:20:03,050
it is which is connected and an integral

01:19:59,450 --> 01:20:06,170
part of the community so I think I think

01:20:03,050 --> 01:20:08,150
in terms of what to do with the from the

01:20:06,170 --> 01:20:10,610
DA point of view it's that it's that

01:20:08,150 --> 01:20:13,130
that community being including the day

01:20:10,610 --> 01:20:15,200
rather than the DA being the one that is

01:20:13,130 --> 01:20:17,720
uniting the community it's uniting

01:20:15,200 --> 01:20:19,130
themselves in the community as well and

01:20:17,720 --> 01:20:21,560
from the open-source perspective I think

01:20:19,130 --> 01:20:25,070
it's really important that we remember

01:20:21,560 --> 01:20:26,750
the kind of ethos of open source in

01:20:25,070 --> 01:20:31,010
every aspect of all the things that we

01:20:26,750 --> 01:20:33,050
do that you know that we talk with our

01:20:31,010 --> 01:20:35,870
staff and but I also talked in community

01:20:33,050 --> 01:20:39,140
events I mean events with the local

01:20:35,870 --> 01:20:40,790
community not not Drupal community about

01:20:39,140 --> 01:20:43,040
the concept of open source because this

01:20:40,790 --> 01:20:44,720
idea of collaboration can be brought

01:20:43,040 --> 01:20:47,530
around everything that we do in life and

01:20:44,720 --> 01:20:50,390
I think as value to bring in so many

01:20:47,530 --> 01:20:52,310
different aspects of what we do in it

01:20:50,390 --> 01:20:53,960
and I don't know if that's the case

01:20:52,310 --> 01:20:56,270
within the DA but I think we need to

01:20:53,960 --> 01:20:57,740
towards remember that whether your staff

01:20:56,270 --> 01:20:59,560
here that it you know it's an open

01:20:57,740 --> 01:21:03,590
community it's an open source community

01:20:59,560 --> 01:21:10,400
and that's a that needs to run as the

01:21:03,590 --> 01:21:14,540
backbone of what's happening well Holly

01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:16,610
come on this is ani again happy can we

01:21:14,540 --> 01:21:19,210
just get all of us together in a room

01:21:16,610 --> 01:21:22,340
and have beers I mean come on Adam addy

01:21:19,210 --> 01:21:23,360
Victor just see you guys know just so

01:21:22,340 --> 01:21:26,420
you guys know throughout this entire

01:21:23,360 --> 01:21:28,010
session ami has been tapping away into

01:21:26,420 --> 01:21:30,080
the question section things like right

01:21:28,010 --> 01:21:32,329
on that's exactly what I think these

01:21:30,080 --> 01:21:36,239
people are so smart

01:21:32,329 --> 01:21:40,550
you all have fans and I'm here I I think

01:21:36,239 --> 01:21:45,810
the primary objective seriously honestly

01:21:40,550 --> 01:21:48,750
this itself proves my belief in Drupal

01:21:45,810 --> 01:21:51,030
the drupal association bringing all of

01:21:48,750 --> 01:21:52,920
us together that we have not even heard

01:21:51,030 --> 01:21:55,020
of each other now we gotta go out and

01:21:52,920 --> 01:21:57,510
find each other out right yeah exactly

01:21:55,020 --> 01:22:01,079
it's just fantastic which is to leave

01:21:57,510 --> 01:22:04,070
your plastic yeah I'm gonna find you

01:22:01,079 --> 01:22:06,599
guys I'm gonna have beer with you guys

01:22:04,070 --> 01:22:09,540
but this is this is this is a great

01:22:06,599 --> 01:22:13,260
dancer this is a great thing to me in

01:22:09,540 --> 01:22:16,320
Drupal is the community it is what what

01:22:13,260 --> 01:22:19,460
is beautiful about Drupal is a community

01:22:16,320 --> 01:22:24,690
and I think drupal association yes

01:22:19,460 --> 01:22:27,150
reaching out to larger markets and which

01:22:24,690 --> 01:22:29,610
not to larger players and then obviously

01:22:27,150 --> 01:22:33,960
strategically understanding where it's

01:22:29,610 --> 01:22:36,840
supposed to go look there's a there's as

01:22:33,960 --> 01:22:43,650
director at large I guess anybody who's

01:22:36,840 --> 01:22:46,199
part of the look the director group is

01:22:43,650 --> 01:22:50,790
supposed to understand we're supposed to

01:22:46,199 --> 01:22:56,940
go I think we all agree on that but I

01:22:50,790 --> 01:22:59,630
think overall all of us is then we are

01:22:56,940 --> 01:23:02,250
all fantastically attached to Drupal

01:22:59,630 --> 01:23:04,710
duble may not be the best software out

01:23:02,250 --> 01:23:09,030
there but I think as as far as community

01:23:04,710 --> 01:23:13,199
goes drupal kicks ass to me Drupal is

01:23:09,030 --> 01:23:17,010
fantastic and that is what or Drupal at

01:23:13,199 --> 01:23:21,570
large director needs to expound go out

01:23:17,010 --> 01:23:27,150
and let people know what happens after

01:23:21,570 --> 01:23:30,570
that is there you go there you go okay

01:23:27,150 --> 01:23:31,770
um all right we are very close to top

01:23:30,570 --> 01:23:33,750
the hour but I know we started a couple

01:23:31,770 --> 01:23:38,489
minutes late I want to give addie and

01:23:33,750 --> 01:23:40,860
Enzo I think you're big last two okay hi

01:23:38,489 --> 01:23:43,020
this is Enzo okay for me to drupal

01:23:40,860 --> 01:23:44,820
association mission is off the

01:23:43,020 --> 01:23:47,810
opportunity to inspire a high qual

01:23:44,820 --> 01:23:50,730
the web products and we can bring this

01:23:47,810 --> 01:23:53,220
amazing products to poor and developing

01:23:50,730 --> 01:23:57,270
countries and that will provide to us

01:23:53,220 --> 01:23:59,970
the opportunity to build amazing tools

01:23:57,270 --> 01:24:02,250
to solve our problems and with this and

01:23:59,970 --> 01:24:04,650
with this solution this is a solution we

01:24:02,250 --> 01:24:07,710
can afford and we can use our rock and

01:24:04,650 --> 01:24:09,990
tunnels so the idea is in this way we

01:24:07,710 --> 01:24:11,970
can have a positive effect in our

01:24:09,990 --> 01:24:15,060
societies and I think this is the most

01:24:11,970 --> 01:24:17,340
important goal in open source how to

01:24:15,060 --> 01:24:19,950
grow in and put communities to reduce

01:24:17,340 --> 01:24:22,800
the detail gap in the world and enough

01:24:19,950 --> 01:24:29,540
episodes we will bring to the world a

01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:29,540
little more equality thanks thanks Anto

those two and and lastly just want to

01:25:37,830 --> 01:25:42,270
remind everyone voting opens on March

01:25:39,900 --> 01:25:45,690
ninth we do use the Instant Runoff

01:25:42,270 --> 01:25:47,700
voting method which means that you will

01:25:45,690 --> 01:25:49,860
not be choosing a single candidate when

01:25:47,700 --> 01:25:51,810
you vote you'll actually be able to rank

01:25:49,860 --> 01:25:53,880
several candidates you don't have to

01:25:51,810 --> 01:25:56,580
rank them all but if you have five or

01:25:53,880 --> 01:25:58,349
six that you know well you can rank

01:25:56,580 --> 01:26:00,929
those five or six candidates

01:25:58,349 --> 01:26:04,199
and the winner is determined based on

01:26:00,929 --> 01:26:06,349
those rankings so that's the method that

01:26:04,199 --> 01:26:08,669
will be using it opens on March ninth

01:26:06,349 --> 01:26:10,079
