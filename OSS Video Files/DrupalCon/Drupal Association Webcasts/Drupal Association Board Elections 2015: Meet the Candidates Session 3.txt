hey all right great thank you all right

00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:08,040
Oh last reminder i forgot be sure to say

00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:10,290
your name before you start speaking that

00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:11,759
that helps me know who's talking because

00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:13,290
we don't know all your voices yet so

00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:15,630
when you go to answer a question feel

00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:20,369
free to start with this is adam and what

00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:23,130
I'd like to say is sound good all right

00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:26,099
so getting started first question for

00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:28,320
you guys today is this what is the big

00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:31,289
critical issue that is facing the

00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,480
project today and what is it that the

00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:39,360
association can contribute to addressing

00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:42,629
that issue this is howard jacobson i'll

00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:45,420
start quickly i would say that the for

00:00:42,629 --> 00:00:47,070
me as a not nearly as technically

00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:49,649
capable as most of the other folks on

00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:54,680
the phone but a long time user it's just

00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:58,559
the barrier to entry for new users into

00:00:54,680 --> 00:01:00,719
putting up a drupal site quickly that

00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:05,720
looks good that's responsive mobile

00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:09,299
first all that kind of good stuff and i

00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:11,670
think that's important because lots of

00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:14,939
people there are lots of choices as

00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:17,580
WordPress Joomla there's Drupal magento

00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:18,960
if you're doing e-commerce and people

00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:21,360
have a limited amount of time to make a

00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:24,000
technology choice and the lower we can

00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,640
make the barrier to entry I think the

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,869
more we'll see the community grow with

00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:36,420
new folks with a diverse set of use

00:01:30,869 --> 00:01:38,369
cases thanks i right and you just

00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:43,110

00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:42,130
same person in my mind but you guys

00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:43,330

recognize him from the drupal cons where

00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:05,889
we somehow cajole him into climbing onto

00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:07,870
tall things and taking our pictures so

00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:09,100

00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:11,590
are you were able to address that

00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:13,449
question first what's the critical issue

00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:15,820
facing the project today and how does

00:05:13,449 --> 00:05:20,610
the association how can the association

00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:20,610
address it who wants to go second I

00:05:22,949 --> 00:05:33,310
guess here in the Simon IDs internet

00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:34,479
alee wrong all right i'm gonna call on

00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:41,080
ratchet cuz we're having a hard time

00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:44,470
getting going ok thanks Roy so uh what I

00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:48,520
feel is the most critical issue at this

00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:50,199
point of time as awareness there's lot

00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:51,460
of initiatives being run by drupal

00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:53,349
association there is a lot of

00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:56,110
initiatives that being run in different

00:05:53,349 --> 00:05:57,250
drooping communities but how people are

00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:59,650
getting aware of you know what's

00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:01,110
happening where I think I think you know

00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:03,940
that is something you know something

00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:05,409
really critical especially I'll

00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:07,000
highlight you know what's happening here

00:06:05,409 --> 00:06:09,340
in Indian community and in a different

00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,289
regional community in in jail you know

00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:14,139
the communities are maturing very fast

00:06:11,289 --> 00:06:16,750
we have done drupal camps you know which

00:06:14,139 --> 00:06:20,169
is like 600 close you know participants

00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:22,090
coming and joining the event but most of

00:06:20,169 --> 00:06:24,340
the pillar not aware of you know drupal

00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:26,860
association what are the thanks for

00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:29,440
being there are so many initiatives that

00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:31,630
they are taking say I think this is a

00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:34,599
you know the point where I think you

00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:37,560
probably need to focus on that's my

00:06:34,599 --> 00:06:37,560
point thank you

00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:45,580
thanks ratchet how about tom do you want

00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:53,490
to answer that one next sure can you

00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:57,880
hear me yes I can't this is tom you can

00:06:53,490 --> 00:07:00,280
we can hear you done ok probably the

00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:01,840
most critical issue i think facing the

00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:05,560
Drupal project right now is getting

00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:07,300
Drupal 8 launched Drupal 8 because way

00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:09,040
overdue and has had an effect on both

00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:11,800
the community members like myself

00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:13,570
they're waiting on the sidelines as well

00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:16,210
as those who are actively working on the

00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:18,400
project who are slowly burning out I'm

00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:21,250
just a very small developer but I've

00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:24,700
watched excitement began to fizz when I

00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:27,070
went to dribble con in Chicago in 2011

00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:30,460
the community was just really alive with

00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:33,460
excitement over what was then a newly

00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:36,490
released d7 and the sessions were just

00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:39,430
packed with enthusiastic members and

00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:42,270
community then 2012 came along there

00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:45,010
were hints of Drupal 8 we were excited

00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:48,640
2013 came with teasers from Drupal 8

00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:51,240
than by 2014 you know we were waiting

00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:54,760
for a release we thought maybe would be

00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:57,040
released in Drupal con but it did the

00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:59,890
grants of the Association has created to

00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:01,530
speed the release interpolate have been

00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:04,570
great to get more people on board but

00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:06,550
helping d'herblay get released should be

00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:08,620
the highest priority for the association

00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:10,270
so that we can once again start to

00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:13,720
rebuild that excitement that I think is

00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:16,110
missing right now and I know me for one

00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:21,040
very small person standing on the edge

00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:24,510
looking in it just is kind of sad I'd

00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:24,510
like to see that excitement come back

00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:31,510
this is Kelly let me know if you can

00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:40,600
hear me and I'll give it a shot you're

00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:42,430
good you voting too oh yeah so I I

00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:46,480
completely agree i've been seeing a lot

00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:50,110
of a Drupal 7 fatigue people eagerly

00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:51,400
waiting for Drupal 8 and really just

00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:53,110
kind of fading into the back

00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,640
waiting for it to come out so I do think

00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:57,460
that the release of Drupal 8 will

00:08:54,640 --> 00:09:00,460
re-energize the community in a huge way

00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:02,440
in the meantime I think it would be

00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:04,750
great for the drupal association to seek

00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:07,600
to find ways to help give support to

00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:09,450
those local drupal group organizers and

00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,920
drupalcamp organizers who are doing

00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:15,160
outreach into the community to help

00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:17,320
bring the community in to do more

00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:19,870
technology in general and to find rupal

00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:26,410
and to be there when to be there for the

00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:28,900
excitement of the release of Drupal 8 hi

00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:31,510
it's Chris here I I agree with what

00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:33,730
everyone has said thus far except i want

00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:35,770
to take maybe a further back approach on

00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:37,960
this or a higher level approach and and

00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:40,480
i think the word structure structure

00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:42,490
structure said three times and even more

00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,170
is maybe the thing that is the most

00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:47,680
critical issue facing the project and

00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:49,320
that's probably the one one area where

00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:52,630
the drupal association you can really

00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:54,070
foster and and spearhead all of these

00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:56,980
other elements the community building

00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:58,810
and the Drupal 8 initiatives and getting

00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:01,960
jubilate released and and that sort of

00:09:58,810 --> 00:10:04,360
thing so I think forming structure

00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:06,820
there's been a lot of talk in the in the

00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:08,590
Drupal sphere about duoc receivers is

00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:11,470
more structuring and how that's all

00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:13,810
handled and I think taking care of that

00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:15,850
from an organizational level will filter

00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:20,530
down into other elements of the project

00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:22,780
itself and that can push a release 58

00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:25,780
and d9 and things in a more efficient

00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:27,790
manner and help to steer things to the

00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:29,950
issue queue and and community building

00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:32,800
and outreach to other parts of the

00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:34,930
Drupal community that are you know

00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,940
multilingual or whatever the case may be

00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:39,850
so i would say at a higher level

00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:41,920
structure and you know well-planned

00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:50,620
structure is probably the most critical

00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:54,220
issue i'd like to jump on board and i

00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:56,230
just set up Michael what do we do

00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:57,520
Michael and then I can't heard yeah I

00:10:56,230 --> 00:11:00,000
think let's do Michael then I think I

00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:00,000
heard Adam

00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:06,209
okay yes so that's Michael hello and yes

00:11:04,589 --> 00:11:08,790
I want to add to what Chris said and I

00:11:06,209 --> 00:11:10,470
think for me its structure is definitely

00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:13,110
a good thing and for me it's also

00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:16,170
getting the small communities that we

00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:18,449
already have all over the world and to

00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:20,970
connect to each other and I see

00:11:18,449 --> 00:11:23,009
especially in Europe where I from where

00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:24,870
I go to a lot of events I see a lot of

00:11:23,009 --> 00:11:27,240
small communities not really talking to

00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:29,459
each other and I think that's where the

00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:33,149
drupal association really can bring in

00:11:29,459 --> 00:11:36,269
its global view to know to get to know

00:11:33,149 --> 00:11:38,250
all these people and to talk to em or

00:11:36,269 --> 00:11:40,139
gets the smaller communities to talk to

00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:44,130
each other which are sometimes really

00:11:40,139 --> 00:11:45,779
close like and especially like in Zurich

00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:47,250
Munich for example which has its own

00:11:45,779 --> 00:11:48,810
Drupal community is really close because

00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:50,850
but because we are living in a different

00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:52,680
country we don't really talk to each

00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:54,480
other a lot and I think that's where the

00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:57,420
duplication can also bring in and then

00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:59,759
at the end also help get things done

00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:02,550
like doing code Sprint's together to

00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:04,500
then again like release to plate but I

00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:06,420
well that's one of the things why I also

00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:09,170
said okay I want to join in because I

00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:11,550
feel a bit that the two blousier shin is

00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:13,560
especially the board of course to staff

00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:16,649
because they are important but it is a

00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:19,440
bit oriented to the US and especially

00:12:16,649 --> 00:12:22,730
having a lot of us board members in and

00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:25,050
so I would like to see you order and

00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:27,990
board members from other countries in

00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:30,240
there or other continents to bring in

00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:34,730
these the knowledge of the different

00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:36,899
culture or the way how things work there

00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:42,029
thanks Michael Adam did you want to

00:12:36,899 --> 00:12:44,370
tackle that one next to yeah that's okay

00:12:42,029 --> 00:12:45,449
i just took a minute but i think the

00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:46,889
question is a really difficult one

00:12:45,449 --> 00:12:49,410
because i don't think there's a critical

00:12:46,889 --> 00:12:51,000
issue for the project of the moment I

00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:53,370
think there's multiple critical issues

00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:57,569
and I think that's not just talking

00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:59,370
about the suq but I think just going on

00:12:57,569 --> 00:13:01,019
from the Drupal 8 I think part of the

00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:02,939
problem is often this the language is

00:13:01,019 --> 00:13:05,399
used in the sense of what people are

00:13:02,939 --> 00:13:08,459
waiting for Drupal 8 and I think that's

00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:10,740
part of the problem in a sense of people

00:13:08,459 --> 00:13:12,389
are waiting instead of people getting

00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:14,250
involved and i think that the

00:13:12,389 --> 00:13:15,180
contribution side of things helping

00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:17,640
organisation

00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:19,500
understand core contribution and the

00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:22,590
value the core contribution can bring to

00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:24,960
their developers or is also really

00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:26,910
really important and that fits into

00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:28,710
again a lot of things other people have

00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:30,180
said but it says what Michaels saying

00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:32,970
about connecting people and connecting

00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:35,940
communities bringing core contribution

00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:38,160
into user group meetups bringing

00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:40,650
co-contribution across user group

00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:42,360
meetups and and yeah as I say getting

00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:44,750
more people understanding that they can

00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:47,610
actually the value of getting involved

00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:50,660
in contributing to the core development

00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:50,660
of the project

00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:58,570
ding hi there it's alex matthews here

00:13:56,650 --> 00:14:00,190
from New Zealand and I'd like to

00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:02,680
strongly agree with everything that's

00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:04,360
been said so far it'd be pretty

00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:06,460
difficult to disagree with any of the

00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:08,140
fantastic comments you've all made um

00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:10,630
however i would take a slightly

00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:12,820
different angle and talk more about the

00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:15,190
other stakeholders that are involved in

00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:18,340
Drupal I feel as though the community is

00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:20,680
really strong and really very capable of

00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:22,150
looking after itself and the association

00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:24,190
i think does a good job of looking after

00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:26,950
the developers and the immediate people

00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:28,630
were involved in java project however I

00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:31,390
feel as though to grow the market share

00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:33,520
of the CMS and to bring a new fresh

00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:35,170
blood it's really important that we're

00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:36,910
thinking about the other stakeholders

00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:39,070
are involved or Drupal which in my case

00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:41,830
is a durable consultants would be

00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:44,530
government clients enterprise clients

00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:46,660
the private sector in general number

00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:48,760
also your local businesses and your

00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:50,230
cafes down the road and your students

00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:52,420
are University in high school they are

00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:54,070
looking for new technology they want to

00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:56,920
be able to use for the web projects and

00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:58,450
software projects so I feel as those but

00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:00,340
I would be more so interested in

00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:02,470
thinking about them and how can we

00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:04,360
outreach to them in terms of letting

00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:06,040
them know what rebels good at I totally

00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:07,990
agree the comments are untrue polite the

00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:10,150
confusion about that and I feel so this

00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:11,290
is a communications challenge and then

00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:13,060
the dribble project needs be

00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:15,490
communicating better back to those

00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:17,500
technology strategists and to the air

00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:19,030
technology consultants they actually end

00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:22,060
up making a lot of the decisions about

00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:23,350
how web technologies used so I feel as

00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:25,630
though the immediate Drupal community

00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:28,120
does have a little bit of work that can

00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:29,620
be done but I would widen the range and

00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:31,930
look more at who's actually making the

00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:39,070
decisions about how triples used the

00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:44,470
commercial and critical phase 3 and Enzo

00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:46,030
or Victor hi hi this is answer in my

00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:48,730
opinion one of the most critical issue

00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:50,890
seen in Drupal is the worldwide

00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:52,750
participation and one of the causes of

00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:55,240
this problem is the language barrier of

00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:57,700
course English is glazed why they use

00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:59,770
but is not good enough to cover the

00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:02,050
whole the whole world so I believe the

00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:04,480
drupal association hotel to encourage

00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:07,250
local community or to help to create

00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:11,450
other communities of different countries

00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:13,820
and stimulate the creation of the

00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:15,620
commutation resources videos plotters

00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:18,350
but not in English in his mother

00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:20,710
language in that way we can bring new

00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:26,030
developers near the commenter's new

00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:29,690
technically it's a with a with this

00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:31,400
resources we will see em in nature

00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:33,800
period of time how the contributions

00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:36,800
from countries like I'm Latin America

00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:43,430
Africa and Asia will have a significant

00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:48,980
greens thank you thanks and tell Victor

00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:52,600
are you still with us yeah great so it's

00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:55,130
victorian daska so i think that the main

00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:57,650
saying that the pasta creation can give

00:16:55,130 --> 00:17:01,070
me if i have problem with with drupal

00:16:57,650 --> 00:17:08,030
project yeah I will if I you need help I

00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:10,520
will try to find partner you know from

00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:17,449
members of the Association because I

00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:20,689
believe that members is very reliable

00:17:17,449 --> 00:17:24,170
companies guys here who I can ask help

00:17:20,689 --> 00:17:30,710
and then we'll help me help me with very

00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:33,920
good quality so i think it's a main

00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:40,910
point of such community of such

00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:46,070
cooperation yeah and such a help yeah

00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:49,310
saw the fall thanks Victor thank you

00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:51,380
yeah and you guys said one thing we had

00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:53,000
one candidate join us um remember when I

00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:56,120
was like oh my gosh we're all here it's

00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,920
crazy let's start it's just kidding we

00:17:56,120 --> 00:18:00,890
had one more candidate join us after the

00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:02,360
fact so I apologize for not having him

00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:05,390
in the mix right in the beginning but

00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:08,330
we've one more Chris Chris McGrath who

00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:10,010
is with us and so Chris you have now had

00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:12,200
a good amount of time to think about how

00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:15,350
you might response that question about

00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:19,299
what the biggest biggest thing is it's

00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:23,259
facing the association today keep it's a

00:18:19,299 --> 00:18:25,470
things that is the point of thing though

00:18:23,259 --> 00:18:28,840
I tried to artfully interweave you know

00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:30,669
3mm so that maybe that i could get a get

00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:33,789
around that thanks thanks very much and

00:18:30,669 --> 00:18:36,820
again same as many has started off their

00:18:33,789 --> 00:18:39,070
response everything that's been said I

00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:43,509
strongly agree with for sure and I think

00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:45,489
that for me I really resonated with what

00:18:43,509 --> 00:18:48,879
Alex was saying that you know the

00:18:45,489 --> 00:18:51,369
product is for our clients you know and

00:18:48,879 --> 00:18:52,929
the stakeholders often that are whatever

00:18:51,369 --> 00:18:56,590
they could ever they may be from their

00:18:52,929 --> 00:18:59,470
different markets and it is important to

00:18:56,590 --> 00:19:01,809
look at what their unique needs are from

00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:04,059
a core perspective but not only that I

00:19:01,809 --> 00:19:06,820
think mainly you know when we think of

00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:10,210
ye association from a governance

00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:12,070
perspective and you know I must say also

00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:14,440
somewhere Howard you know and I am a

00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:17,139
front end guy I'm a business guy I'm

00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:18,460
strategy guy I'm a governance guy you

00:19:17,139 --> 00:19:21,549
know as far as an entrepreneur is

00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:25,480
concerned but I'm not hands-on with the

00:19:21,549 --> 00:19:28,859
code reviews or code contributions from

00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:32,139
th from PHP perspective of with the

00:19:28,859 --> 00:19:34,779
contributed modules and that you know I

00:19:32,139 --> 00:19:36,369
work very closely moment by moment with

00:19:34,779 --> 00:19:38,019
back-end developers so you know I have

00:19:36,369 --> 00:19:41,049
some glimpse into what's going on in the

00:19:38,019 --> 00:19:42,730
process and so on and you know recently

00:19:41,049 --> 00:19:44,499
I mean let's say like after let's say

00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:45,999
three years of working heads down with

00:19:44,499 --> 00:19:48,309
Drupal every day I was like hey you know

00:19:45,999 --> 00:19:51,369
what's up with this I hear about you

00:19:48,309 --> 00:19:54,309
know the process of contributed modules

00:19:51,369 --> 00:19:57,639
and then becoming you know released and

00:19:54,309 --> 00:19:59,169
so on and peer reviews and you know the

00:19:57,639 --> 00:20:02,200
different grumbles that will see out

00:19:59,169 --> 00:20:04,749
there there's some threads going on you

00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:07,239
know right now just about changes that

00:20:04,749 --> 00:20:09,519
occur in a major module effect you know

00:20:07,239 --> 00:20:11,710
many many other websites and so on and

00:20:09,519 --> 00:20:14,019
you point a finger pointing things of

00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:16,769
that nature and I think that you know we

00:20:14,019 --> 00:20:19,690
seem to have our act together with core

00:20:16,769 --> 00:20:21,789
but you know the wire a larger more

00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:23,619
unwieldly problem is really the

00:20:21,789 --> 00:20:25,929
governing governing process of

00:20:23,619 --> 00:20:27,460
contributed modules and you know to the

00:20:25,929 --> 00:20:31,240
best of our abilities what you know

00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:33,340
being an open source community of the

00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:36,220
the maintenance and sustainability of

00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:38,830
those modules and I know that's always

00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:41,730
been a a focus but I think it's

00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:45,850
something that needs to be truly truly

00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:48,100
refined and and that as someone who you

00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:50,559
know crafts messages who helps build

00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:53,050
organizations and so on you know to me

00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:56,620
that can only really be done when

00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:58,240
confidence is high in a good product you

00:20:56,620 --> 00:21:02,530
know and for me you know of course that

00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:05,860
means security and and governance around

00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:07,690
the core code that is being plugged into

00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:09,160
these websites you know every second of

00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:11,800
every minute of the day you know all

00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:13,030
over the world so that that's you know

00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:15,760
what I really think the Association

00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:21,220
could do I'd love to be involved in and

00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:24,010
helping out awesome thank you well let's

00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:26,740
switch gears a little bit um I am my

00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:29,260
ears perked up when enzo mentioned the

00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:31,360
language barrier that faces the projects

00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:33,790
and how that's a that's a tough hurdle

00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:35,559
to get over in terms of contribution we

00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:37,750
have so many people from around the

00:21:35,559 --> 00:21:40,330
world who would contribute if they could

00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:43,570
contribute um you know potentially in

00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:45,580
their own language and that's suddenly

00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:50,020
something we've thought a lot about over

00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:51,520
here at the association and sort of what

00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:54,690
immediately comes to mind for us every

00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:57,130
time if that's really expensive to do

00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:59,200
especially you know we just did drop

00:21:57,130 --> 00:22:01,150
drupalcon Latin America we did some live

00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:03,400
simey simultaneous translation

00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:07,600
obsessions into English Portuguese and

00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:10,270
Spanish and it was great that we had

00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:13,210
someone who stepped up to volunteer

00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:15,070
their experience in translation company

00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:17,830
called lingotek to translate some of the

00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:19,390
session videos but every time we try to

00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:25,660
tackle this we really run into the price

00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:29,650
tag of it which which does beg the

00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:32,080
question for us about how what our

00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:35,260
funding sources should be at the

00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:37,900
association you know primarily now

00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:39,550
triple cons drive the revenue at the

00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:41,590
association we've been working on

00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:43,000
expanding those revenue streams and I

00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:45,090
would just love to hear from some of the

00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,800
candidates about what

00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:49,020
you think the opportunities are for the

00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:50,760
Association to grow the revenue to

00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:52,530
support these programs and if there are

00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:57,060
boundaries around you know where that

00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:59,790
revenue can come from all the other love

00:22:57,060 --> 00:23:02,280
terms of this one is possible yeah I to

00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:04,950
Adam sorry yeah I think one of the big

00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:06,600
things I guess I'm talking mostly from

00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:11,540
from kind of my experience now I saw

00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:14,940
them in Europe elite there's a ton of

00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:19,010
grants available and opportunities for

00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:24,300
funding and cooperation across countries

00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:27,510
for innovation for technology across all

00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:28,950
kinds of different themes but but I

00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:34,740
think this is a really missed

00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:36,900
opportunity having said that a peon

00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:38,430
organization so kind of comes onto one

00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:41,340
the other point so I've talked about

00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:46,200
before in terms of how we develop the

00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:48,960
European or of course other outposts

00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:50,190
let's say of the drupal association but

00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,080
i think that's one way that could be

00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:54,210
could be looked into that applying for

00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:56,550
these funds as a large organization

00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:58,980
already has the infrastructure it's not

00:23:56,550 --> 00:24:03,360
such a crazy thing i think it would

00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:05,730
bring really different opportunities to

00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:08,370
to the organizations involved across

00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:11,370
across europe and also the neighboring

00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:13,950
countries and worldwide and just coming

00:24:11,370 --> 00:24:15,450
on to the language thing I think we've

00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:17,190
got to look at it in two ways one it

00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:18,630
with this an open source community

00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:20,490
everyone contributes and I think that

00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:23,160
from some level we can we can work with

00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:24,840
language on a contribution level and the

00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:27,090
second one it you know we as you

00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:28,860
mentioned lingotek and other language

00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:30,930
companies are out there there's a ton of

00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:32,610
Drupal innovations it should be able to

00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:34,710
help us with that and I think if we

00:24:32,610 --> 00:24:37,880
can't then there it's a bit of a worry

00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:41,810
when there's so much was of that kind of

00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:41,810
help within the community

00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:44,190
you

00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:52,500
Holly this is Howard J hi again great

00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:56,910
please go ahead out all right um thank

00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:59,250
you um this the situation that the

00:24:56,910 --> 00:25:02,340
drupal association is in is really not

00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:04,170
unlike the challenge faced by any

00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:05,940
nonprofit whether it's supporting a

00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:09,270
technology or it's supporting research

00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:12,590
for some sort of disease and you depend

00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:15,570
on primarily charitable contributions

00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:17,430
membership fees in the association's

00:25:15,570 --> 00:25:21,060
case of drupalcon is the major source of

00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:22,800
revenue the one thing that I've seen

00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:26,480
working with some of the local

00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:30,180
nonprofits here is that relying on

00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:33,690
charity is a dangerous thing to do

00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:38,790
because charity generally ebbs and flows

00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:40,170
with the economy and when people don't

00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:42,420
have a lot of money or feel like they

00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:44,520
don't have a lot of money they tend not

00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:47,070
to contribute as much and nonprofits

00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:51,000
suffer so I think the Association needs

00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:53,160
to find more drupalcon type revenue

00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:58,670
sources that can make it independent as

00:25:53,160 --> 00:26:01,290
much as possible of charitable

00:25:58,670 --> 00:26:03,000
contributors and there are certainly

00:26:01,290 --> 00:26:07,380
many other needs in the community

00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:09,770
whether it's training needs there are

00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:12,410
obviously folks out there doing training

00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:15,960
in Drupal and making good money at it

00:26:12,410 --> 00:26:17,730
and while it may be a delicate issue

00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:20,190
whether to compete with those folks I

00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:22,650
think the association's long-term

00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:24,840
survival depends on as much financial

00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:27,260
independence as possible and with

00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:30,150
respect to the language issue I think

00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:32,750
it's almost certainly going to be a long

00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:34,820
time before the Association can afford

00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:39,030
realistically to meet the

00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:40,920
internationalization needs of all the

00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:45,660
different countries even represented on

00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:48,240
this phone call and what the association

00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:51,330
can do is bring to bear its community

00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:54,150
organizational skills to help local

00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:55,389
leaders whether in the Ukraine or Costa

00:26:54,150 --> 00:26:59,009
Rico or

00:26:55,389 --> 00:27:03,489
other countries to organize their own

00:26:59,009 --> 00:27:09,070
local internationalization translation

00:27:03,489 --> 00:27:12,070
efforts using as a resource the content

00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:14,200
that the Association has available and

00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:20,829
is and is usable by everyone in an

00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:22,989
open-source basis thank you I only

00:27:20,829 --> 00:27:25,299
that's my glass Chris here um this time

00:27:22,989 --> 00:27:26,379
let's go let's go Chris and Michael cuz

00:27:25,299 --> 00:27:29,259
I didn't Chris you were trying to get in

00:27:26,379 --> 00:27:31,959
last time too yeah sorry uh okay so I

00:27:29,259 --> 00:27:34,329
have smelly are a relatively fair amount

00:27:31,959 --> 00:27:42,609
of experience with Oh Chris Lockhart

00:27:34,329 --> 00:27:44,519
Hayden chris you're all good to go Chris

00:27:42,609 --> 00:27:48,399
Lockhart well yep you're all good to go

00:27:44,519 --> 00:27:50,529
okay sorry so I have a relatively fair

00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:52,479
amount of experience with the community

00:27:50,529 --> 00:27:54,909
in Japan I've been there two or three

00:27:52,479 --> 00:27:57,759
times and I've done some work with them

00:27:54,909 --> 00:28:00,789
on their drupal camps and trying to deal

00:27:57,759 --> 00:28:04,690
with the language barrier and I think

00:28:00,789 --> 00:28:06,999
the thing that I've seen is that in

00:28:04,690 --> 00:28:08,889
terms of funding with money and time

00:28:06,999 --> 00:28:10,769
because time certainly equals money in

00:28:08,889 --> 00:28:12,820
money equals time as we all know

00:28:10,769 --> 00:28:16,629
volunteerism has always been very strong

00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:21,249
with with the Drupal community and with

00:28:16,629 --> 00:28:24,309
a lack of funding the eagerness has not

00:28:21,249 --> 00:28:25,950
been quelled I guess the there are

00:28:24,309 --> 00:28:28,839
members of that community who are are

00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:31,179
pushing vigorously to volunteer time to

00:28:28,839 --> 00:28:35,679
translate some of the Drupal books that

00:28:31,179 --> 00:28:38,679
are popular and and also trying to do

00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:41,049
translations just you know in different

00:28:38,679 --> 00:28:43,659
aspects through YouTube tutorials and

00:28:41,049 --> 00:28:46,989
that sort of thing to explain simple

00:28:43,659 --> 00:28:49,690
concepts to entry-level Drupal users

00:28:46,989 --> 00:28:51,729
like views the word view in English

00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:54,129
means one thing but views means another

00:28:51,729 --> 00:28:55,929
thing in the Drupal nomenclature so it's

00:28:54,129 --> 00:28:58,119
it's a difficult thing for them to to

00:28:55,929 --> 00:29:01,419
get around so volunteerism is certainly

00:28:58,119 --> 00:29:03,279
a strong thing and again maybe jumping

00:29:01,419 --> 00:29:06,759
back to the first question about how the

00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:08,860
DEA can help and the issues with the

00:29:06,759 --> 00:29:12,340
Drupal project

00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:14,620
this whole idea of organizing and

00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:17,950
providing organizational skills and

00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:19,450
opportunities for for the project as a

00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:21,850
whole and people around the world trying

00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:24,130
to get involved helping to organize that

00:29:21,850 --> 00:29:25,780
is is maybe not a way to make money but

00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:28,809
it's a way to save money and time I

00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:30,250
think in the long term and again

00:29:28,809 --> 00:29:31,809
traditionally you know grants and

00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:33,040
sponsorships are our key thing those

00:29:31,809 --> 00:29:37,299
those things come from government

00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:40,450
sources capital interests and that sort

00:29:37,299 --> 00:29:46,210
of thing so those are our certainly key

00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:47,710
elements of it as well thanks thanks

00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:54,000
Michael I think you're home I'll jump in

00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:56,620
next oh go ahead oh sorry Oh who's going

00:29:54,000 --> 00:30:02,830
here's what we figured out you guys 10

00:29:56,620 --> 00:30:04,360
is too jealous we're going over the

00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:06,220
outcome candidates but I think Michael

00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:07,990
wanted to go Michael was a in line after

00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:12,669
Chris before and then we can and then we

00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:14,200
can move on okay good and yes I think

00:30:12,669 --> 00:30:17,700
one interesting thing is that we just

00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:21,040
shortly mentioned like that actually and

00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:23,350
the true pecans are responsible for

00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:26,070
seventy-five percent of all the revenue

00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:28,270
that the DA makes and I think and

00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:31,179
whether that's really cool i mean as you

00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:35,020
said Holly it's it's important that we

00:30:31,179 --> 00:30:37,030
try to to to spread that out and ask the

00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:39,549
DA board currently already decided you

00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:42,160
want to bring that for 2017 we want to

00:30:39,549 --> 00:30:44,440
bring that down a little bit to have

00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:45,549
other streams and i think one really

00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:46,900
interesting thing in the Drupal

00:30:45,549 --> 00:30:49,720
community right now happens is that

00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:53,950
companies are more and more involved to

00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:55,600
get known for what they do and we heard

00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:59,020
that from Ruiz talking about that we

00:30:55,600 --> 00:31:01,270
wanna show and what companies paid for

00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:03,580
or that they sponsored some of the

00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:06,070
contribution and I think that actually

00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:08,830
goes into and not just having

00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:14,200
sponsorships where you as a company can

00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:17,500
sponsor the akan or just be a member of

00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:19,210
the or a partner of the Association I

00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:20,980
think it's more and more specifically

00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:22,330
that companies can say okay I want to

00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:24,850
sponsor

00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:27,279
and the last critical park that was

00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:29,799
fixed on Drupal 8 or something like that

00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:32,350
and and because there are all these

00:31:29,799 --> 00:31:34,409
opportunities are out there and it just

00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:36,700
needs a lot of time from the DA to

00:31:34,409 --> 00:31:39,010
generate them or to generate these

00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:41,289
opportunities to talk to companies and

00:31:39,010 --> 00:31:45,220
but i think if we provide more of them

00:31:41,289 --> 00:31:47,710
and companies rather spend more money or

00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:51,190
sponsoring money to to support them and

00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:52,720
I think and if I look at the at the

00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:54,730
amount of people we want to hire in the

00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:56,500
drupal association right now i see a lot

00:31:54,730 --> 00:31:58,750
of them are in the revenue team and I

00:31:56,500 --> 00:32:01,240
think that's already and a really good

00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:04,330
start to just have more people that can

00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:07,000
support the company's and if they want

00:32:04,330 --> 00:32:08,919
to spend money and how they can spend it

00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,720
inside of trouble because I don't

00:32:08,919 --> 00:32:13,120
believe that the money isn't there it

00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:19,480
just takes time to under to tell them

00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:21,070
and find the money thanks Michael can I

00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:24,639
jump in here at this point on me do it

00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:27,210
Daleks here cool i'll try and be quick

00:32:24,639 --> 00:32:29,500
um written comments from everyone else

00:32:27,210 --> 00:32:31,870
however i'm surprised a few other things

00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:34,809
about mentions to be honest um i think

00:32:31,870 --> 00:32:37,779
obviously making the most of the dribble

00:32:34,809 --> 00:32:39,340
cons and optimizing and maximizing the

00:32:37,779 --> 00:32:42,820
income strings that we already have is a

00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:44,200
good idea however i think there's a

00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:46,720
conversation that still needs to happen

00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:49,419
about potential services that the

00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:50,620
association can offer and i think that

00:32:49,419 --> 00:32:52,330
if you're looking at diversifying your

00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:53,889
income streams from a business

00:32:52,330 --> 00:32:57,039
perspective all you can really do is

00:32:53,889 --> 00:32:59,529
think about no other income streams and

00:32:57,039 --> 00:33:01,899
one of them in my mind could actually be

00:32:59,529 --> 00:33:03,669
two birds with one stone and terms are

00:33:01,899 --> 00:33:06,070
providing the communication strategy

00:33:03,669 --> 00:33:08,559
around the release of each version so

00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:11,769
for instance i've got a lot of large

00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:13,299
clients um you know who spend hundreds

00:33:11,769 --> 00:33:15,880
of thousands and millions of dollars on

00:33:13,299 --> 00:33:18,429
durable websites and they have a really

00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:21,279
strong interest and knowing where drupal

00:33:18,429 --> 00:33:23,080
assess and weird light is coming i know

00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:25,299
that a lot of this information is public

00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:26,980
already I feel as though there be large

00:33:25,299 --> 00:33:30,250
organizations and be willing to pay

00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:31,600
extra to the drupal association in order

00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:33,460
to have perhaps and dedicated

00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:35,420
communicator would be able to put

00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:38,990
together regular reports

00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:41,300
a detail a lot of analysis we're driven

00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:44,120
lizette where it's going how far ins to

00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:47,030
plate away how many issues are there on

00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:48,350
the core modules I feel like there is

00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:50,210
actually a service there there could be

00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:52,970
provided that enterprise and government

00:33:50,210 --> 00:33:55,460
would pay for I'm just to have a larger

00:33:52,970 --> 00:33:57,020
degree of detail information around

00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:59,960
triple strategy and Technology Strategy

00:33:57,020 --> 00:34:01,760
mineral and the finally I think another

00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:03,740
income stream that should be talked

00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:05,480
about and there was talked about years

00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:07,220
and years ago I'm i remembered Rubicon

00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:08,840
London that was a big deal and then I

00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:11,870
sort of died off and then specifically

00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:15,020
the idea of a premium Drupal marketplace

00:34:11,870 --> 00:34:18,110
and actually met coke commercializing

00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:20,270
certain degree of drupal.org and being

00:34:18,110 --> 00:34:22,340
able to sell your premium themes and

00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:24,320
modules here and distributions and so

00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:26,240
forth I know that the highly sensitive

00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:28,310
topic and I'm not saying it has to be

00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:29,720
that way but if I was challenged to

00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:32,179
think about how Drupal can make more

00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:33,830
money definitely some kind of commercial

00:34:32,179 --> 00:34:38,510
marketplace would be a thought that

00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:41,240
would come to mind ok I'll don't know

00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:45,500
this is Tom can I jump in that's what

00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:50,540
I'm okay today I am both two times or

00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:55,300
one time they're killing 50 go until you

00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:59,150
win Kelly thanks let's go Kelly men tom

00:34:55,300 --> 00:35:00,530
okay um yeah so I was going to say

00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:02,960
something very similar to what has been

00:35:00,530 --> 00:35:04,550
said before um one thing though that I

00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:07,430
will say about be we got to be careful

00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:10,460
with organ with donations or

00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:14,060
contributions resulting in special

00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:16,100
benefits for for companies I kind of

00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:17,380
makes me think of now that we're going

00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:20,240
to have a bunch of drupal association

00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:22,910
lobbyists lobbying for you know what

00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:25,700
what they want and then that their

00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:27,500
contribution should buy them that one

00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:28,940
thing that i would i would think would

00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:32,090
be pretty cool would be if the drupal

00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:33,410
association focused on the million

00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:35,450
although you know you look at all that

00:35:33,410 --> 00:35:39,140
there is to do in drupal and it's just a

00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:41,120
treasure chest of potential projects and

00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:44,540
to group those projects up get levels of

00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:46,430
effort on them and then sell them sell

00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:49,260
sponsorships to them so it's very much

00:35:46,430 --> 00:35:52,530
like what Michael was

00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:54,390
describing where people can sponsor

00:35:52,530 --> 00:35:57,300
could sponsor we could get maybe we

00:35:54,390 --> 00:36:00,900
could get a level of effort on some of

00:35:57,300 --> 00:36:03,180
this translation things that we're

00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:05,900
trying to do and then people you could

00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:08,820
find a good fit for that I'm sure

00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:11,520
lingotek is already donating a lot of

00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:13,590
their time maybe other companies would

00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:16,440
like to sign on to that maybe you know

00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:19,140
in a larger company like a huge company

00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:21,330
we just want to put their sponsorship on

00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:24,630
a specific project and then we can get

00:36:21,330 --> 00:36:26,520
the funding for those things and figure

00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:30,960
out how to organize resources to get

00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:33,480
them done thanks Kelly and Tom I think

00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:34,860
you are next time this is richer oh hang

00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:38,490
on one second ratchet I think we'll do

00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:40,830
you Tom grandi and reg Travis's Tom yep

00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:43,170
Tommy you can go I probably did talk to

00:36:40,830 --> 00:36:45,240
that all right thank you ratchet hey I'm

00:36:43,170 --> 00:36:46,350
a drupal developer but I'm at that guy

00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:49,320
who's never going to be a core

00:36:46,350 --> 00:36:51,270
contributor like many many others and we

00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:53,450
feel that we have a need that there's a

00:36:51,270 --> 00:36:59,100
place for us in the Drupal community but

00:36:53,450 --> 00:37:01,110
somehow we don't feel like we belong and

00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:02,610
there's thousands hundreds of thousands

00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:05,520
of people like me that we need to reach

00:37:02,610 --> 00:37:07,410
out to those new and fringe developers

00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:09,470
to read leave their sense of not being

00:37:07,410 --> 00:37:13,050
good enough or large enough of a player

00:37:09,470 --> 00:37:15,360
to participate and by doing so good our

00:37:13,050 --> 00:37:17,100
community as more members joined

00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:18,720
globally the cons get bigger the

00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:23,100
membership capital grows and becomes

00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:25,770
easier to get sponsorships but look to

00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:27,360
get more members into the Association we

00:37:25,770 --> 00:37:29,900
need to come up with a let's just say a

00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:32,250
welcome the Drupal path it shows people

00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:34,290
new to Drupal or those who are outside

00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:37,110
the bubble how to get involved and why

00:37:34,290 --> 00:37:38,820
their participation counts it's not all

00:37:37,110 --> 00:37:42,420
about core there are so many other areas

00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:44,520
where help is definitely need it but to

00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:47,430
make that transition easy and welcoming

00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:50,040
for for all countries maybe in their

00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:51,810
particular language so the association

00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:54,090
grows globally and our association

00:37:51,810 --> 00:37:55,500
revenues grow along with it we're never

00:37:54,090 --> 00:38:00,160
going to be in a position where we can

00:37:55,500 --> 00:38:02,890
have offices in every country

00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:06,059
that are staffed and paid for but you

00:38:02,890 --> 00:38:08,170
know perhaps we can have some sort of

00:38:06,059 --> 00:38:10,329
representation upstream from those

00:38:08,170 --> 00:38:12,880
different countries to counter

00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:14,079
representation on the board and then

00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:15,520
they're going to feel like they're more

00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:17,829
involved but getting back to that small

00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:19,329
purse I really think there's hundreds of

00:38:17,829 --> 00:38:22,089
thousands of people out there like me

00:38:19,329 --> 00:38:24,069
you know i'm a member but there's a lot

00:38:22,089 --> 00:38:25,500
who are members just because they just

00:38:24,069 --> 00:38:30,730
don't feel like they're good enough

00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:36,940
that's all thanks ratchet do you want to

00:38:30,730 --> 00:38:39,099
happen now hi this is Richard I agree

00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:42,579
with the point what Tom brought in and

00:38:39,099 --> 00:38:44,619
in fact I'll focus more on that so what

00:38:42,579 --> 00:38:47,079
I have been seeing in my community is

00:38:44,619 --> 00:38:48,760
you know these regional communities the

00:38:47,079 --> 00:38:51,099
local communities are doing excellent

00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:53,109
job they're doing you know Laura

00:38:51,099 --> 00:38:54,309
weariness and you know they're the one

00:38:53,109 --> 00:38:57,430
who are giving in a lot of these

00:38:54,309 --> 00:38:59,230
informations about you know coming on

00:38:57,430 --> 00:39:02,170
board on you know drupal association

00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:04,450
membership you know participating in

00:39:02,170 --> 00:39:07,599
different initiatives that drupal

00:39:04,450 --> 00:39:10,480
association string and then these local

00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:13,390
communities are doing huge are you camps

00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:15,579
and events I have seen you know several

00:39:13,390 --> 00:39:17,619
camps that has happened in India and you

00:39:15,579 --> 00:39:21,730
know they've done excellent job in

00:39:17,619 --> 00:39:25,329
raising funds so my point is that may be

00:39:21,730 --> 00:39:27,490
a you know drupal association can have a

00:39:25,329 --> 00:39:29,020
you know representation at national

00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:31,960
level or could have an office at

00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:34,630
national level which facilitates you

00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:36,460
know these camps and you know the

00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:39,309
revenue that we generate from these

00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:42,400
events can be the fun that we can

00:39:39,309 --> 00:39:45,760
collect for drupal project other way

00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:48,430
this can't hurt us these local

00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:50,859
communities can also help in giving the

00:39:48,430 --> 00:39:53,289
first hand information making you know

00:39:50,859 --> 00:39:55,089
people more aware of you know were the

00:39:53,289 --> 00:39:56,849
benefits of becoming a member you know

00:39:55,089 --> 00:39:59,200
how would how you're you know

00:39:56,849 --> 00:40:01,779
participation can help this project I

00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:04,329
think there is a huge potential there I

00:40:01,779 --> 00:40:06,359
I don't see lot of people you know

00:40:04,329 --> 00:40:08,710
coming and you know becoming a member

00:40:06,359 --> 00:40:12,380
especially in a growing and maturing

00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:14,240
community like India

00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:21,950
believe this kind of model can really

00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:26,029
play a very significant role Thanks

00:40:21,950 --> 00:40:33,829
ratchet uh Chris McGrath or ENSO the end

00:40:26,029 --> 00:40:38,210
of us holy yeah Enzo hi yep in this is

00:40:33,829 --> 00:40:39,859
ok ok go ahead quick another Helens oh

we'll finish it yes ma'am ok me or Cris

00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:55,039
not reasons oh ok ok i think the tackle

00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:56,630
the problem of worldwide participation

00:40:55,039 --> 00:40:59,599
on a mobile vid we don't need to create

00:40:56,630 --> 00:41:01,819
a a big multilingual even like drupal

00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:03,710
come ova tub which was association even

00:41:01,819 --> 00:41:06,170
but i did in the beginning we need to

00:41:03,710 --> 00:41:07,880
find key players who is speak the

00:41:06,170 --> 00:41:10,250
language of the country of the video we

00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:12,950
want to help let me let me say about the

00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:15,769
history of working in Central America

00:41:12,950 --> 00:41:17,930
the first event we have was lead but a

00:41:15,769 --> 00:41:20,359
german guy fred is dead battery in

00:41:17,930 --> 00:41:21,890
nicaragua he created fierce drupal

00:41:20,359 --> 00:41:25,339
central america and i believe what the

00:41:21,890 --> 00:41:27,740
fierce international even in a drupal

00:41:25,339 --> 00:41:30,019
even in the world where we have

00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:33,349
participation about nine countries and

00:41:30,019 --> 00:41:35,210
we have some a good key players

00:41:33,349 --> 00:41:39,140
published was one of them nature from

00:41:35,210 --> 00:41:41,690
saving actions he he did a some really

00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:44,509
good sessions in Spanish not reference

00:41:41,690 --> 00:41:48,650
planet are really good Spanish and also

00:41:44,509 --> 00:41:50,960
we a verdicts in bison people interested

00:41:48,650 --> 00:41:53,660
in Drupal from Costa Rica Panama Mexico

00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:56,329
Guatemala and after that and after I

00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:59,660
honestly Devon because we have some

00:41:56,329 --> 00:42:02,660
limitations English in the region we we

00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:05,420
we we try to connect each other to try

00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:08,150
to help us to resolve the problem and to

00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:11,569
create the commutation in a language so

00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:14,599
i think this using this approach is it's

00:42:11,569 --> 00:42:17,630
not really expensive because we can find

00:42:14,599 --> 00:42:19,160
some disc a player he do that job as a

00:42:17,630 --> 00:42:20,900
volunteer but if you don't have the

00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:22,940
resources to do that maybe they have the

00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:26,360
time and then the Dipple association

00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:29,540
could help with expenses and to try to

00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:31,340
to hell the this community and an ideal

00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:34,040
for instant that is something I can do

00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:35,990
and because I you speak English and

00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:37,940
Spanish but I can go for any phone

00:42:35,990 --> 00:42:40,280
instant to guinea ecuatorial who is the

00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:44,810
unique country speaking Spanish in

00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:47,930
Africa and if i do this i kin I that

00:42:44,810 --> 00:42:51,530
will be the seat for assaulting a bigger

00:42:47,930 --> 00:42:53,780
with a small investment for me or for

00:42:51,530 --> 00:42:55,820
part of the polarization and I believe

00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:58,490
that is something we can do better in

00:42:55,820 --> 00:43:02,770
Latin America but and also we can repeat

00:42:58,490 --> 00:43:02,770
this experience in Africa and a she

00:43:05,050 --> 00:43:14,510
thank thank you despite thanks anza yeah

00:43:11,690 --> 00:43:17,480
again a lot of great points from

00:43:14,510 --> 00:43:19,070
everybody and some you know take the

00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:21,680
words out of my mouth but I think that

00:43:19,070 --> 00:43:24,740
too and those points to start off it is

00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:28,270
for me you know to find strong regional

00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:30,110
leaders um even from a volunteer

00:43:28,270 --> 00:43:31,400
perspective you know they don't have to

00:43:30,110 --> 00:43:34,640
be directors they don't have to have any

00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:36,920
particular you know lofty title but I

00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:38,990
think if you find those folks like Enzo

00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:41,330
there are in other areas that are

00:43:38,990 --> 00:43:44,590
willing to tackle that problem at least

00:43:41,330 --> 00:43:47,570
that will begin you know on the road of

00:43:44,590 --> 00:43:50,000
internationalization which it is a long

00:43:47,570 --> 00:43:52,820
road and is it is huge I mean I was

00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:55,100
speaking with my team in india today and

00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:56,780
they were telling me about drupal camp

00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:58,730
hyderabad and how you know there was

00:43:56,780 --> 00:44:00,740
going to be 200 people there and that

00:43:58,730 --> 00:44:02,150
was just tiny you know i mean there's

00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:05,600
nothing like Mumbai or something like

00:44:02,150 --> 00:44:07,790
that I was like 200 devs you know it in

00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:11,660
a city you know that's a lot actually

00:44:07,790 --> 00:44:14,930
and that that leads to many places so

00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:17,540
you know it's important to foster in

00:44:14,930 --> 00:44:19,880
places like maybe in some of the app the

00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:22,550
backbones you know of the delivery of

00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:24,830
the product in many cases um you know

00:44:22,550 --> 00:44:26,690
the community and you know I know

00:44:24,830 --> 00:44:29,030
drupalcon still in there next year and

00:44:26,690 --> 00:44:32,000
you know and as an example however

00:44:29,030 --> 00:44:34,010
certainly not just the only and so also

00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,750
I think that through that it's a domino

00:44:34,010 --> 00:44:38,690
effect you know where are some of the

00:44:35,750 --> 00:44:39,880
things that Tom and she you know we want

00:44:38,690 --> 00:44:41,769
we need to be reaching out

00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:45,130
to the students to growing the talent

00:44:41,769 --> 00:44:47,680
pool to increasing the Intendant see

00:44:45,130 --> 00:44:49,450
attendance of Deacons so that you know

00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:51,880
we are strengthening one of our key

00:44:49,450 --> 00:44:53,920
revenue sources but then again to alex's

00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:56,490
point where you know we are also

00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:58,779
creating other products and in

00:44:56,490 --> 00:45:01,390
diversifying that we have the job board

00:44:58,779 --> 00:45:03,730
now that's strong one and certain

00:45:01,390 --> 00:45:06,180
certainly should have happened I think

00:45:03,730 --> 00:45:08,380
you can similarly rule out something I

00:45:06,180 --> 00:45:09,849
hope this is an exactly what Alex said

00:45:08,380 --> 00:45:12,759
it was you know something to the effect

00:45:09,849 --> 00:45:15,190
of a training marketplace I agree with

00:45:12,759 --> 00:45:17,019
that you know if you use the leverage

00:45:15,190 --> 00:45:19,809
that the Association has for brand

00:45:17,019 --> 00:45:22,029
awareness you know to help the little

00:45:19,809 --> 00:45:24,430
guys as they have you know in the past

00:45:22,029 --> 00:45:25,980
with the product itself I think that's

00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:28,750
just going to be a good thing to

00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:31,480
perpetuate I think you can do the same

00:45:28,750 --> 00:45:33,730
from a support offering perspective you

00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:35,109
know almost a paid volunteer I mean

00:45:33,730 --> 00:45:37,029
we're not all maybe going to get we

00:45:35,109 --> 00:45:38,589
would out there in the marketplace what

00:45:37,029 --> 00:45:42,099
we're supporting the product we're

00:45:38,589 --> 00:45:44,349
healing one of the biggest gaps in the

00:45:42,099 --> 00:45:46,269
product and you know we're doing that at

00:45:44,349 --> 00:45:48,910
the association grassroots level rather

00:45:46,269 --> 00:45:50,710
than you know some blow a box or whoever

00:45:48,910 --> 00:45:54,970
the corporation is that's you know

00:45:50,710 --> 00:45:57,670
offering that formally so you know that

00:45:54,970 --> 00:46:01,180
as well as the corporate sponsors and I

00:45:57,670 --> 00:46:03,460
remember you know some of the lobbying

00:46:01,180 --> 00:46:05,529
comments and I think that you know again

00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:07,900
if there is corporate sponsorships are

00:46:05,529 --> 00:46:10,269
key not only from a code sponsorship

00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:12,339
level but from a donation perspective so

00:46:10,269 --> 00:46:14,789
clearly you know there needs to be at

00:46:12,339 --> 00:46:18,009
least some small teams surrounded around

00:46:14,789 --> 00:46:20,170
cultivating steering and you know making

00:46:18,009 --> 00:46:23,079
sure that that is a success and i would

00:46:20,170 --> 00:46:25,089
say similarly but separately in the

00:46:23,079 --> 00:46:28,420
grant department if you're any nonprofit

00:46:25,089 --> 00:46:30,910
as mentioned earlier it's it's we are a

00:46:28,420 --> 00:46:35,769
group of volunteers we are a group of

00:46:30,910 --> 00:46:39,369
volunteers that has such a skill and you

00:46:35,769 --> 00:46:40,630
know highly paid in a talents you know

00:46:39,369 --> 00:46:42,549
we certainly should be able to find some

00:46:40,630 --> 00:46:46,210
experience grant writers i think that

00:46:42,549 --> 00:46:49,380
you know can help us so dep that would

00:46:46,210 --> 00:46:51,640
be my thoughts thanks Craig

00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:55,720
Victor do you want to round us out with

00:46:51,640 --> 00:47:01,060
a few words yeah sure so my suggestion

00:46:55,720 --> 00:47:03,160
is to use crowdfunding manner so drop

00:47:01,060 --> 00:47:06,910
Association can publish I think can

00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:10,360
publish project for crowdfunding like

00:47:06,910 --> 00:47:16,960
Kickstarter and Drupal estas will fund

00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:19,060
this by project the direction yeah this

00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:24,160
is simple I think that's all thank you

00:47:19,060 --> 00:47:26,290
all right you guys we are gonna take a

00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:29,470
cue from Victor and enter a lightning

00:47:26,290 --> 00:47:30,640
round cuz we told me cats about 35

00:47:29,470 --> 00:47:31,870
minutes left in the call and I want to

00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:33,250
make sure we get to another couple of

00:47:31,870 --> 00:47:35,170
questions they do have some from the

00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:37,330
community here so we're gonna do our

00:47:35,170 --> 00:47:39,010
best to keep our answer super brief here

00:47:37,330 --> 00:47:42,790
since we have so many of us here today

00:47:39,010 --> 00:47:44,380
but here is the question for you guys in

00:47:42,790 --> 00:47:46,240
that last round of answers we had a lot

00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:48,190
of different funding ideas for the

00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:51,070
Association and thank you very much i

00:47:48,190 --> 00:47:55,990
wrote them down things to think about

00:47:51,070 --> 00:47:57,310
for sure but one of the things that one

00:47:55,990 --> 00:47:59,680
of the communities of the Association

00:47:57,310 --> 00:48:02,310
and the Drupal community doesn't really

00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:04,600
cater too much right now our Drupal

00:48:02,310 --> 00:48:06,580
businesses that use Drupal right some

00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:11,310
triple customers right not developers

00:48:06,580 --> 00:48:14,560
not agencies the end users of Drupal

00:48:11,310 --> 00:48:17,350
should we be incorporating those end

00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:21,030
users into the community more and what

00:48:17,350 --> 00:48:24,460
can we do to bring them to the community

00:48:21,030 --> 00:48:25,360
if that's the question and remember

00:48:24,460 --> 00:48:31,180
we're going to try to answer in

00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:33,870
lightning around format subtle Holly

00:48:31,180 --> 00:48:37,120
this is our Jacob see him that's a

00:48:33,870 --> 00:48:38,950
really really quickly uh 15 years ago I

00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:41,080
was the senior business development

00:48:38,950 --> 00:48:43,480
executive for for the largest book the

00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:47,950
trade open source companies since moved

00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:49,660
on from that but the key in my view to

00:48:47,950 --> 00:48:52,210
getting customers connected to the

00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:57,190
community is enabling the consultants

00:48:52,210 --> 00:48:59,770
development houses film shops with great

00:48:57,190 --> 00:49:01,600
information about Drupal because

00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:02,619
businesses are interested in their

00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:05,799
business

00:49:02,619 --> 00:49:08,319
technology is just a tool so if we give

00:49:05,799 --> 00:49:12,609
our developer community of a consultant

00:49:08,319 --> 00:49:16,210
community great information resources to

00:49:12,609 --> 00:49:18,400
educate their customers we leverage the

00:49:16,210 --> 00:49:22,599
investment Association make to reach out

00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:23,970
to a much much larger group of what end

00:49:22,599 --> 00:49:34,859
users and we couldn't any other way

00:49:23,970 --> 00:49:37,869
thank you hi sorry here's your tonic uh

00:49:34,859 --> 00:49:44,349
I'll be very close yeah let's go ahead

00:49:37,869 --> 00:49:48,819
and let's go ahead and sorry guys let's

00:49:44,349 --> 00:49:51,460
go ahead and go with Alex okay I'm gonna

00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:52,480
very you know this is a topic I'm very

00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:54,609
passionate about and I've got some

00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:57,430
strong ideas on it I feel as that we

00:49:54,609 --> 00:49:59,769
need to beat out reaching not only to

00:49:57,430 --> 00:50:01,210
business businesses in general and end

00:49:59,769 --> 00:50:03,069
users and the white stakeholder

00:50:01,210 --> 00:50:05,140
community I feel as though the web

00:50:03,069 --> 00:50:07,299
resources and rule at all to do a far

00:50:05,140 --> 00:50:09,099
better job of facilitating this I also

00:50:07,299 --> 00:50:11,650
feel as though we could actually be

00:50:09,099 --> 00:50:13,660
zeroing in on specific communities of

00:50:11,650 --> 00:50:16,710
practice and giving them more tools and

00:50:13,660 --> 00:50:19,180
resources such as Drupal for hospitals

00:50:16,710 --> 00:50:21,819
Drupal for government dribble for

00:50:19,180 --> 00:50:25,119
entertainment drupal for our the school

00:50:21,819 --> 00:50:26,680
down the road um no Drupal for young web

00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:28,749
designers I feel as though you could

00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:30,579
actually segment off certain parts of

00:50:28,749 --> 00:50:33,130
the Drupal website jewel the log website

00:50:30,579 --> 00:50:34,720
and provide specific resources for them

00:50:33,130 --> 00:50:36,999
for instance if you want to make a

00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:39,309
website for nonprofits or environmental

00:50:36,999 --> 00:50:41,410
agency no Drupal has a lot of

00:50:39,309 --> 00:50:43,329
distributions and themes and modules

00:50:41,410 --> 00:50:44,710
available that can help that but finding

00:50:43,329 --> 00:50:46,660
them all in one place and finding a

00:50:44,710 --> 00:50:48,099
resource that's perfect for an

00:50:46,660 --> 00:50:49,930
administrator of a non-profit is

00:50:48,099 --> 00:50:51,670
actually quite hard so I feel as though

00:50:49,930 --> 00:50:53,710
we could actually be making targeted

00:50:51,670 --> 00:50:59,440
resources at a better for specific

00:50:53,710 --> 00:51:02,589
communities on breakfast hello this is

00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:05,650
richard i agree with Alex this point of

00:51:02,589 --> 00:51:08,499
many of the interaction that had had you

00:51:05,650 --> 00:51:10,900
know the committee members you know the

00:51:08,499 --> 00:51:12,700
one of the big challenges that and users

00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:15,890
are facing you know they're not aware of

00:51:12,700 --> 00:51:18,109
what what's available add in

00:51:15,890 --> 00:51:19,730
interaction with the professor in an

00:51:18,109 --> 00:51:23,480
institution and they were trying to use

00:51:19,730 --> 00:51:25,099
Drupal for their institution website but

00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:26,809
they find it very challenging and they

00:51:25,099 --> 00:51:29,599
are to consider to show up drupal shop

00:51:26,809 --> 00:51:31,880
which was very costly so making them

00:51:29,599 --> 00:51:34,549
more aware giving them a more resources

00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:36,559
information and how easily they can you

00:51:34,549 --> 00:51:38,750
know use Drupal consume Drupal I think

00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:40,279
it's already there it's just a matter of

00:51:38,750 --> 00:51:43,130
you know giving them the right set of

00:51:40,279 --> 00:51:50,859
information I i think you know that's my

00:51:43,130 --> 00:51:54,980
boy okay I'll jump in this is Kelly

00:51:50,859 --> 00:51:58,849
Donna Kelly Kelly vent on your instinct

00:51:54,980 --> 00:52:02,960
me yeah we just we're just ready to talk

00:51:58,849 --> 00:52:06,470
at the same time um well the way that

00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:08,990
I've seen it worked really well is the

00:52:06,470 --> 00:52:10,730
Drupal marketplace um I think is a

00:52:08,990 --> 00:52:12,140
really beautiful thing that is it

00:52:10,730 --> 00:52:15,260
there's already efforts going into

00:52:12,140 --> 00:52:18,440
making that even more effective and I

00:52:15,260 --> 00:52:21,289
think that's working great so more that

00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:24,289
I think would help but then I would also

00:52:21,289 --> 00:52:27,109
say something about the way another way

00:52:24,289 --> 00:52:30,230
I see it working is a lot of times when

00:52:27,109 --> 00:52:32,119
a customer is a good fit for Drupal it's

00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:33,769
because they have something fairly

00:52:32,119 --> 00:52:36,710
complicated that they want to do

00:52:33,769 --> 00:52:39,049
something a little bit outside what you

00:52:36,710 --> 00:52:41,329
know WordPress could do or some or some

00:52:39,049 --> 00:52:43,579
you know service website service

00:52:41,329 --> 00:52:45,769
platform can do and really what they're

00:52:43,579 --> 00:52:48,259
looking for is just somebody who's

00:52:45,769 --> 00:52:51,109
really smart apropriate op notch

00:52:48,259 --> 00:52:53,839
programmer because the complicated thing

00:52:51,109 --> 00:52:56,720
that they want to accomplish needs the

00:52:53,839 --> 00:52:59,329
right tools for the job to be used and a

00:52:56,720 --> 00:53:02,359
lot of times most of the times from what

00:52:59,329 --> 00:53:04,339
I see those programmers and web

00:53:02,359 --> 00:53:07,160
developers want to use Drupal because

00:53:04,339 --> 00:53:11,900
they see how it's a good fit so getting

00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:14,180
a more consultants more programmers in

00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:16,670
the Drupal will get more people

00:53:14,180 --> 00:53:19,160
recommending Drupal to those customers

00:53:16,670 --> 00:53:21,980
knowing about Drupal and being able to

00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:24,680
see that it is the most elegant way to

00:53:21,980 --> 00:53:27,470
do so many complex and complicated

00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:29,230
things so it's not directly finding ways

00:53:27,470 --> 00:53:30,940
to

00:53:29,230 --> 00:53:33,100
or get a customer and get and connect

00:53:30,940 --> 00:53:35,290
them to Drupal but it's enabling and

00:53:33,100 --> 00:53:38,920
empowering web developers and

00:53:35,290 --> 00:53:46,960
programmers to know and recommend droop

00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:49,630
was a solution yes okay hi there this is

00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:50,920
tom i do you think Oh sir that's all

00:53:49,630 --> 00:53:54,820
right go for it Tom and then we're gonna

00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:56,410
go to one of the crisis okay yeah call

00:53:54,820 --> 00:53:57,700
me concerned but I'm not sure that we

00:53:56,410 --> 00:53:59,530
want to bring businesses into the

00:53:57,700 --> 00:54:02,170
community because the voice of the

00:53:59,530 --> 00:54:04,840
individual developer who feels empowered

00:54:02,170 --> 00:54:07,000
in the association becomes lost to

00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:09,040
larger businesses who could start

00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:11,410
influencing the voice of the association

00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:13,840
to me the association was about the

00:54:11,410 --> 00:54:15,250
community of the users not the community

00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:16,810
for the businesses that have the deepest

00:54:15,250 --> 00:54:17,859
pockets and their their money is

00:54:16,810 --> 00:54:19,390
important but I don't know that I

00:54:17,859 --> 00:54:25,990
necessarily want them being part of the

00:54:19,390 --> 00:54:27,310
Association great which chris one just

00:54:25,990 --> 00:54:31,810
wanted to go next and i completely

00:54:27,310 --> 00:54:33,190
disagree with that much i completely

00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:37,570
disagree because that sounds interesting

00:54:33,190 --> 00:54:40,150
I I think I would completely disagree

00:54:37,570 --> 00:54:42,280
with that I want to see everybody that

00:54:40,150 --> 00:54:44,380
does has anything to do with Drupal I

00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:47,710
want to see being part of the community

00:54:44,380 --> 00:54:51,250
and I brought my own clients to Drupal

00:54:47,710 --> 00:54:52,930
cons to see that they can see what the

00:54:51,250 --> 00:54:56,290
community currently is and I can tell

00:54:52,930 --> 00:54:59,050
you they so much more love that they so

00:54:56,290 --> 00:55:02,200
much more understood what open source is

00:54:59,050 --> 00:55:04,570
what Rubicon is what triple is that they

00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:06,430
went back to their bosses and told them

00:55:04,570 --> 00:55:09,640
like we need to do more with open source

00:55:06,430 --> 00:55:11,320
and so I think it's really important

00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:13,020
that we get everybody that has something

00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:16,600
to do with Drupal in the communities

00:55:13,020 --> 00:55:20,050
understand what it is and at the end

00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:25,780
spread the word about Drupal and do and

00:55:20,050 --> 00:55:28,119
let us do more websites with it yeah

00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:30,550
this is chris mcgrath I agree with

00:55:28,119 --> 00:55:32,740
Michael and I thought you know we heard

00:55:30,550 --> 00:55:35,950
that before I mean corporations with

00:55:32,740 --> 00:55:38,320
money I usually helps drupal you know I

00:55:35,950 --> 00:55:40,180
mean look at omni media Martha Stewart

00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:42,000
mean these crops major goals with nature

00:55:40,180 --> 00:55:43,950
funds because they have goals

00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:46,140
and then they leave it behind for us so

00:55:43,950 --> 00:55:49,260
you know usually I would say that can't

00:55:46,140 --> 00:55:50,580
be too bad of a problem I believe as I

00:55:49,260 --> 00:55:52,770
mentioned earlier we probably need some

00:55:50,580 --> 00:55:54,990
governance around it but important

00:55:52,770 --> 00:55:58,020
should we involve the end client you

00:55:54,990 --> 00:56:00,870
know as Alex was saying absolutely

00:55:58,020 --> 00:56:03,870
absolutely we need to you know promote

00:56:00,870 --> 00:56:06,480
quality ensure quality give constant

00:56:03,870 --> 00:56:08,670
assurances in every way similar to these

00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:10,830
educational ideas that Alex had

00:56:08,670 --> 00:56:13,200
mentioned just in general constant

00:56:10,830 --> 00:56:16,590
outreach so that you know someone heard

00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:18,420
wordpress was easier and they may be a

00:56:16,590 --> 00:56:20,820
client and it may may go on to tell

00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:22,380
whomever in their midst that Drupal is

00:56:20,820 --> 00:56:25,500
what they're using is what we need

00:56:22,380 --> 00:56:27,300
that's what this is organic growth and

00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:30,510
so I just feel like you know we have to

00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:33,120
do that promote consonant organic growth

00:56:30,510 --> 00:56:35,220
and just answer needs I mean that's how

00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:38,250
the client will come to you the end user

00:56:35,220 --> 00:56:42,060
will come to you bought via a need I

00:56:38,250 --> 00:56:45,900
need training they made me about Drupal

00:56:42,060 --> 00:56:48,990
from high up I need support i'm not sure

00:56:45,900 --> 00:56:52,560
what will happen you know i mean drupal

00:56:48,990 --> 00:56:54,480
to me is we need our own fdic you know

00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:56,910
as others have said you know people have

00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:59,820
millions invested in this major major

00:56:56,910 --> 00:57:01,470
dollars they need security and you know

00:56:59,820 --> 00:57:06,840
I quia can't be the only game in town

00:57:01,470 --> 00:57:10,290
nor shouldn't be in my can I can I agree

00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:13,710
and disagree absolutely you can if you

00:57:10,290 --> 00:57:17,970
tell me I know with you with it Darya

00:57:13,710 --> 00:57:21,060
Tata me thanks Adam excuse me and ya

00:57:17,970 --> 00:57:22,560
know just in terms of the the aggrieved

00:57:21,060 --> 00:57:24,540
disagree in terms of them being involved

00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:30,510
i guess i think there's this different

00:57:24,540 --> 00:57:32,490
spaces with different people an amazing

00:57:30,510 --> 00:57:34,200
place to it for for client for end-users

00:57:32,490 --> 00:57:37,260
to bring pretty much anyone it's just an

00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:40,230
amazing place in general i'm not sure

00:57:37,260 --> 00:57:41,700
for example the suq czar drupal.org is

00:57:40,230 --> 00:57:43,140
exactly the place where where those

00:57:41,700 --> 00:57:45,150
people want to be so I think there's

00:57:43,140 --> 00:57:47,040
this kind of we have to be aware of

00:57:45,150 --> 00:57:50,730
which places are for the right people if

00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:53,370
you look at maybe what what dresses done

00:57:50,730 --> 00:57:55,320
with Drupal calm and then think about in

00:57:53,370 --> 00:57:55,890
terms of what what you want the end user

00:57:55,320 --> 00:57:57,150
to be

00:57:55,890 --> 00:58:00,059
hang out and the kind of information you

00:57:57,150 --> 00:58:02,220
want them to be seeing and I think yeah

00:58:00,059 --> 00:58:04,950
we need to choose wisely the places

00:58:02,220 --> 00:58:06,960
where where those people go but I do

00:58:04,950 --> 00:58:08,519
absolutely agree that I think that the

00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:10,859
idea of the end user being involved is

00:58:08,519 --> 00:58:12,569
kind of paramount immunity those those

00:58:10,859 --> 00:58:14,609
those people are the people who are

00:58:12,569 --> 00:58:16,829
going to make Drupal more of a kind of

00:58:14,609 --> 00:58:18,839
household name and we and I think that

00:58:16,829 --> 00:58:21,210
also from the Association point of view

00:58:18,839 --> 00:58:24,779
that's about also educating or helping

00:58:21,210 --> 00:58:26,789
to educate or supporting the agencies to

00:58:24,779 --> 00:58:28,650
be much more clear about the fact that

00:58:26,789 --> 00:58:30,809
they're using Drupal what Drupal is to

00:58:28,650 --> 00:58:32,880
the end user as much as it is about kind

00:58:30,809 --> 00:58:34,529
of the drupal association trying to

00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:36,329
reach out to the end users I don't think

00:58:34,529 --> 00:58:38,250
that's a kind of very realistic

00:58:36,329 --> 00:58:39,839
proposition but i think the kind of

00:58:38,250 --> 00:58:42,720
multiplier effect and giving giving

00:58:39,839 --> 00:58:45,779
support to the agencies to really reach

00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:49,250
out to those to those end users it would

00:58:45,779 --> 00:58:49,250
be really time and money well-spent

00:58:51,019 --> 00:58:58,109
think that I'm Canadian Chris here scope

00:58:55,730 --> 00:59:01,140
it's fine I'm technique that's awesome

00:58:58,109 --> 00:59:02,670
carry on well it's one way to Chris like

00:59:01,140 --> 00:59:07,529
our Canadian Chris that all it all works

00:59:02,670 --> 00:59:11,160
so so Drupal is inclusive so the idea of

00:59:07,529 --> 00:59:12,509
not allowing different entities to get

00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:15,180
involved with with the Drupal community

00:59:12,509 --> 00:59:17,849
i think is probably wrong it's just a

00:59:15,180 --> 00:59:20,579
matter of how to organize how all of

00:59:17,849 --> 00:59:22,529
that works and to cater to the different

00:59:20,579 --> 00:59:24,980
end users properly whether it's you know

00:59:22,529 --> 00:59:27,329
developers businesses clients etc etc

00:59:24,980 --> 00:59:28,859
people will come to Drupal because they

00:59:27,329 --> 00:59:30,859
want to come to Drupal historically I

00:59:28,859 --> 00:59:33,210
think that's been the case with Drupal

00:59:30,859 --> 00:59:35,400
Drupal doesn't necessarily reach out per

00:59:33,210 --> 00:59:37,380
se people are coming to Drupal companies

00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:39,269
are coming to Drupal for their business

00:59:37,380 --> 00:59:42,059
needs to make money save money save time

00:59:39,269 --> 00:59:43,799
and and that sort of thing so it's it's

00:59:42,059 --> 00:59:45,779
a matter of how to cater to them

00:59:43,799 --> 00:59:47,490
properly and and I actually think the

00:59:45,779 --> 00:59:49,680
seeds of this are already in place with

00:59:47,490 --> 00:59:51,509
the persona series because that's a

00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:54,509
gateway to a content strategy for drupal

00:59:51,509 --> 00:59:56,759
org that can reorganize the information

00:59:54,509 --> 00:59:58,140
that's on the site and engineer it so

00:59:56,759 --> 01:00:00,690
that it goes to the right audience at

00:59:58,140 --> 01:00:05,130
the right time so how that all works is

01:00:00,690 --> 01:00:07,950
it's a pretty complex you know pot to to

01:00:05,130 --> 01:00:09,300
stir but i do think those seeds are

01:00:07,950 --> 01:00:11,220
already there with with the

01:00:09,300 --> 01:00:13,890
persona series and building on that and

01:00:11,220 --> 01:00:15,810
and engineering the content to get to

01:00:13,890 --> 01:00:18,990
them properly so when people come to

01:00:15,810 --> 01:00:20,130
drupal.org you know usually via google

01:00:18,990 --> 01:00:22,350
searches or whatever if they're not

01:00:20,130 --> 01:00:23,520
knee-deep in the project already they

01:00:22,350 --> 01:00:25,650
will get to the information they want

01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:28,050
quickly whether it is siphoning off

01:00:25,650 --> 01:00:30,420
different areas and siloing them for for

01:00:28,050 --> 01:00:32,040
specific use cases maybe that's the way

01:00:30,420 --> 01:00:33,420
or maybe you know doing it all within

01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:35,220
the home page and then filtering real

01:00:33,420 --> 01:00:37,470
from there or whatever but those are

01:00:35,220 --> 01:00:39,960
decisions that would have to be made and

01:00:37,470 --> 01:00:41,400
dealt with appropriately but I do think

01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:43,380
some some of the seeds are there for

01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:48,180
sure and it's just continuing to nurture

01:00:43,380 --> 01:00:50,250
that properly so that those those you

01:00:48,180 --> 01:00:52,440
know people reaching into Drupal or you

01:00:50,250 --> 01:00:54,570
know outreach in the content matching

01:00:52,440 --> 01:01:02,540
their their needs is is dealt with

01:00:54,570 --> 01:01:08,880
properly thanks Canadian Chris probably

01:01:02,540 --> 01:01:11,520
Holly up on that yes enter why don't you

01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:13,650
go ahead and go okay I by the person how

01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:16,230
we can involve end-users to do /

01:01:13,650 --> 01:01:19,170
community I think we can provide tools

01:01:16,230 --> 01:01:23,340
and 20 users to propose new features

01:01:19,170 --> 01:01:26,280
using tools like a user voice so my idea

01:01:23,340 --> 01:01:28,620
is if suddenly the end users they see

01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:31,500
new features they propose included in

01:01:28,620 --> 01:01:35,070
Drupal this is a direct measures we are

01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:36,450
listening our any users also I I love

01:01:35,070 --> 01:01:38,610
the idea of others about to create a

01:01:36,450 --> 01:01:41,190
commutation for vertical business and I

01:01:38,610 --> 01:01:45,360
think we can materialize dyed it matter

01:01:41,190 --> 01:01:48,330
why's that and unwrap I found in some

01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:52,850
distributions to attack a vertical

01:01:48,330 --> 01:01:52,850
business thank you

01:01:55,190 --> 01:02:00,650
and so and I think I think Victor is the

01:01:59,030 --> 01:02:02,810
only one I think only this is comic by

01:02:00,650 --> 01:02:08,359
me Oh tom go for it sorry I missed you

01:02:02,810 --> 01:02:09,619
oh I just wanted to clarify you know I

01:02:08,359 --> 01:02:11,000
don't believe businesses should be an

01:02:09,619 --> 01:02:12,829
influential part of governance because

01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:14,480
users like me end up feeling like our

01:02:12,829 --> 01:02:17,030
place is no longer going to be hurt and

01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:18,800
to bring clients to a con to educate

01:02:17,030 --> 01:02:22,040
them for them to see the power of the

01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:24,160
community is fantastic but not as part

01:02:22,040 --> 01:02:29,510
of the Association you know if there I

01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:30,829
just want to clarify that gotcha that

01:02:29,510 --> 01:02:35,000
definitely makes sense and I appreciate

01:02:30,829 --> 01:02:37,550
you taking a moment to clarify that and

01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:39,560
then I think Victor you are the only

01:02:37,550 --> 01:02:43,970
other person did you want to have

01:02:39,560 --> 01:02:47,210
something add some in here yeah okay

01:02:43,970 --> 01:02:50,569
here so from my mind absolutely agree

01:02:47,210 --> 01:02:58,550
that we should promote Drupal to also to

01:02:50,569 --> 01:03:01,550
users yeah it will it will let us to

01:02:58,550 --> 01:03:04,099
have Drupal not popular yeah and three

01:03:01,550 --> 01:03:07,780
or more users we will have more at

01:03:04,099 --> 01:03:14,480
alliance yeah we will have more projects

01:03:07,780 --> 01:03:18,650
so it was a soul thank you Brian okay

01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:20,839
you guys I think um many of you got the

01:03:18,650 --> 01:03:22,670
lightning round thing down good job I

01:03:20,839 --> 01:03:23,960
think if we apply those principles one

01:03:22,670 --> 01:03:26,000
more time we can ask one more question

01:03:23,960 --> 01:03:28,700
from the community here on the call

01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:29,810
which I'd love to get to because it's

01:03:28,700 --> 01:03:32,720
something we don't talked about any of

01:03:29,810 --> 01:03:35,690
the other calls either and that is about

01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:37,640
the age of our community and bringing

01:03:35,690 --> 01:03:39,609
speaking of bringing new people in so

01:03:37,640 --> 01:03:41,810
we've talked a little bit about them

01:03:39,609 --> 01:03:43,490
geographic diversity we've talked about

01:03:41,810 --> 01:03:46,280
diversity in terms of the types of folks

01:03:43,490 --> 01:03:48,619
that are engaged in the projects what

01:03:46,280 --> 01:03:51,890
about the next generation of Drupal

01:03:48,619 --> 01:03:54,130
developers how do we bring in all the

01:03:51,890 --> 01:03:59,380
cool kids who might be thinking that

01:03:54,130 --> 01:03:59,380
ruby is somehow more exciting than PHP

01:04:02,560 --> 01:04:08,089
hello and ready

01:04:04,369 --> 01:04:10,670
this is richard i'm going to talk about

01:04:08,089 --> 01:04:12,470
a you know one of the initiative that we

01:04:10,670 --> 01:04:15,289
are working on something called drupal

01:04:12,470 --> 01:04:16,970
campus ambassador program where we are

01:04:15,289 --> 01:04:19,759
trying to reach out to education

01:04:16,970 --> 01:04:23,119
institutions and you know trying to

01:04:19,759 --> 01:04:26,019
build a kind of ecosystem where we find

01:04:23,119 --> 01:04:29,119
some open source evangelists and these

01:04:26,019 --> 01:04:30,829
educational institutions who form a kind

01:04:29,119 --> 01:04:33,410
of you know committee and you know

01:04:30,829 --> 01:04:36,529
promote drupal evangelize trooper within

01:04:33,410 --> 01:04:38,839
their you know Campus Center you know

01:04:36,529 --> 01:04:41,059
these persons are coy campus ambassadors

01:04:38,839 --> 01:04:42,559
like we have google ambassadors and

01:04:41,059 --> 01:04:45,769
ambassadors so this is going to be here

01:04:42,559 --> 01:04:47,509
trooper and pastures and we already

01:04:45,769 --> 01:04:50,509
started you know tying up that you know

01:04:47,509 --> 01:04:53,119
few universities here the idea is to get

01:04:50,509 --> 01:04:55,130
drupal you know drew place and that

01:04:53,119 --> 01:04:57,349
level you know when when they're really

01:04:55,130 --> 01:04:59,359
learning the new concepts we are

01:04:57,349 --> 01:05:02,059
learning the engineering concepts and

01:04:59,359 --> 01:05:04,130
they're the one who can actually you

01:05:02,059 --> 01:05:06,440
know without worrying about the pressure

01:05:04,130 --> 01:05:09,680
of work and you know a lot of new

01:05:06,440 --> 01:05:11,509
degrees around you know managing you

01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:13,309
know other strokes of the work they can

01:05:11,509 --> 01:05:16,099
involve with the community they can

01:05:13,309 --> 01:05:19,339
contribute that they can prove to be the

01:05:16,099 --> 01:05:22,819
next generation you know the the biggest

01:05:19,339 --> 01:05:26,779
contributor from you know a you know all

01:05:22,819 --> 01:05:30,019
over the the regions so I think you know

01:05:26,779 --> 01:05:33,650
this kind of initiatives could you know

01:05:30,019 --> 01:05:36,529
lead to bring luck new brains newbies

01:05:33,650 --> 01:05:39,140
and that could you know resolve a lot of

01:05:36,529 --> 01:05:41,869
issues one of the biggest issues that I

01:05:39,140 --> 01:05:44,779
hear in these communities trooper

01:05:41,869 --> 01:05:47,569
resources the scarcity of trooper

01:05:44,779 --> 01:05:49,400
resources so a lot of Industry lot of

01:05:47,569 --> 01:05:53,539
companies are you know really interested

01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:59,720
in you know this initiatives so that is

01:05:53,539 --> 01:06:02,420
my dick hi canadian Chris here I've got

01:05:59,720 --> 01:06:04,279
a couple points that kind of speak to

01:06:02,420 --> 01:06:08,390
this whole idea of reaching out to a

01:06:04,279 --> 01:06:11,359
more youthful attendance I guess or

01:06:08,390 --> 01:06:14,690
participation in the Drupal community so

01:06:11,359 --> 01:06:17,299
a slight digression but as part of

01:06:14,690 --> 01:06:18,289
organizing a large the Drupal North

01:06:17,299 --> 01:06:21,829
event that's coming up

01:06:18,289 --> 01:06:24,499
we tried to ensure that it was hosted at

01:06:21,829 --> 01:06:26,660
a educational facility ryerson

01:06:24,499 --> 01:06:27,799
university in our situation here and

01:06:26,660 --> 01:06:29,209
we've always tried to do that too

01:06:27,799 --> 01:06:32,179
because then we're hopefully going to

01:06:29,209 --> 01:06:33,829
cater to students and you know that

01:06:32,179 --> 01:06:35,539
demographic I suppose and one of the

01:06:33,829 --> 01:06:38,660
first questions I asked if the venue is

01:06:35,539 --> 01:06:40,069
how do we get your student population to

01:06:38,660 --> 01:06:42,529
get involved in the in the conference

01:06:40,069 --> 01:06:44,599
how do we get them to attend so so

01:06:42,529 --> 01:06:46,880
that's part of it to reaching out events

01:06:44,599 --> 01:06:49,929
and trying to target those those kinds

01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:54,140
of facilities and events and audiences

01:06:49,929 --> 01:06:55,969
marketing in some respect to those to

01:06:54,140 --> 01:06:57,679
that demographic I really I don't know

01:06:55,969 --> 01:06:59,589
how to do it other than actually having

01:06:57,679 --> 01:07:03,069
events there and that kind of thing but

01:06:59,589 --> 01:07:07,039
some some sort of a marketing campaign

01:07:03,069 --> 01:07:10,069
about about you know getting students

01:07:07,039 --> 01:07:11,749
involved with Drupal from a developer

01:07:10,069 --> 01:07:13,519
perspective that the cool features in

01:07:11,749 --> 01:07:16,339
Drupal 8 that that i'm looking forward

01:07:13,519 --> 01:07:18,589
to are things that that might excite

01:07:16,339 --> 01:07:20,959
students you know getting to work with

01:07:18,589 --> 01:07:22,939
cool things in a headless drupal kind of

01:07:20,959 --> 01:07:24,559
configuration or whatnot and maybe that

01:07:22,939 --> 01:07:27,099
again is part of the marketing concept

01:07:24,559 --> 01:07:29,769
or just sharing that knowledge

01:07:27,099 --> 01:07:32,900
throughout communities outside Drupal

01:07:29,769 --> 01:07:35,059
and I can think of a couple of specific

01:07:32,900 --> 01:07:37,729
cases where companies are actually

01:07:35,059 --> 01:07:40,549
specifically hiring out of colleges and

01:07:37,729 --> 01:07:43,329
universities so that they can train raw

01:07:40,549 --> 01:07:46,279
talent and get them to use Drupal so

01:07:43,329 --> 01:07:48,349
somehow encouraging companies to do that

01:07:46,279 --> 01:07:51,679
or creating some kind of incentive for

01:07:48,349 --> 01:07:54,109
companies to do that is maybe one way

01:07:51,679 --> 01:07:56,179
the DA can help out you know those are

01:07:54,109 --> 01:07:58,329
just some some quick ideas some quick

01:07:56,179 --> 01:07:58,329
thoughts

01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:07,040
Thanks press anyone else want to hop in

01:08:04,670 --> 01:08:08,450
and you know this is Henry how are the

01:08:07,040 --> 01:08:12,530
sour jacobsen if you don't my house

01:08:08,450 --> 01:08:14,060
thank you um the cool thing about this

01:08:12,530 --> 01:08:19,730
conversation we're having today the

01:08:14,060 --> 01:08:21,800
Association has every day is that I it's

01:08:19,730 --> 01:08:23,480
the same conversation has been has many

01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:25,250
times by many different kinds of

01:08:23,480 --> 01:08:28,040
businesses trying to figure out how to

01:08:25,250 --> 01:08:30,350
grow their business than 15 years ago

01:08:28,040 --> 01:08:33,010
Linux was having this conversation I was

01:08:30,350 --> 01:08:35,960
at the table listening to the very same

01:08:33,010 --> 01:08:37,610
sorts of discussions and I think the key

01:08:35,960 --> 01:08:40,520
for the Association to manage its

01:08:37,610 --> 01:08:43,160
limited resources is to look back at how

01:08:40,520 --> 01:08:45,980
other projects like Linux we're

01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:47,750
successful and not successful we did

01:08:45,980 --> 01:08:49,520
things right 15 years ago we did things

01:08:47,750 --> 01:08:51,650
wrong but one of the things we

01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:56,810
definitely do brighter was turn linux

01:08:51,650 --> 01:08:59,300
into a worldwide powerful technology not

01:08:56,810 --> 01:09:02,840
just for big business and not just for

01:08:59,300 --> 01:09:05,270
you know hackers there's something for

01:09:02,840 --> 01:09:07,880
everybody in Linux and I'd say the

01:09:05,270 --> 01:09:11,840
community there is as vibrant as it has

01:09:07,880 --> 01:09:13,850
ever been and I'm sure that Drupal can

01:09:11,840 --> 01:09:17,800
learn a lot from what others have done

01:09:13,850 --> 01:09:21,380
and stand on their shoulders thank you

01:09:17,800 --> 01:09:25,690
yeah I think Alex was trying to hop in

01:09:21,380 --> 01:09:28,910
there now if we go to Alex Matthews okay

01:09:25,690 --> 01:09:30,560
okay I'll be I'll be very quick um I

01:09:28,910 --> 01:09:33,350
completely agree with all those points I

01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:36,800
feel as though the reality of the ground

01:09:33,350 --> 01:09:39,950
and coolness happens on the ground with

01:09:36,800 --> 01:09:43,400
real people I mean recently I've taken

01:09:39,950 --> 01:09:46,190
on three new interns and two new Themis

01:09:43,400 --> 01:09:47,720
none of which should ever use Drupal at

01:09:46,190 --> 01:09:49,100
all that night hear about it and they'd

01:09:47,720 --> 01:09:51,320
heard bad things about it so there must

01:09:49,100 --> 01:09:53,150
wasn't cool but as soon as they started

01:09:51,320 --> 01:09:55,100
using it as soon as they got some basic

01:09:53,150 --> 01:09:56,960
training and some basic education they

01:09:55,100 --> 01:09:58,280
instantly fell in love and I've seen

01:09:56,960 --> 01:10:00,320
this happening all the time with me

01:09:58,280 --> 01:10:02,150
adopters to dribble I think the barrier

01:10:00,320 --> 01:10:04,190
to it being call is just people getting

01:10:02,150 --> 01:10:05,750
into it it's like criticizing a TV

01:10:04,190 --> 01:10:08,480
series you've never actually watched um

01:10:05,750 --> 01:10:10,010
so I feel like at the end of the day

01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:11,960
that is going to be facilitated on the

01:10:10,010 --> 01:10:14,420
ground I feel so the best way for the

01:10:11,960 --> 01:10:15,170
Association to help would involve so

01:10:14,420 --> 01:10:16,310
much what we were talking about

01:10:15,170 --> 01:10:18,620
yesterday and

01:10:16,310 --> 01:10:20,900
terms of supporting local chapters

01:10:18,620 --> 01:10:22,820
supporting local meetups supporting the

01:10:20,900 --> 01:10:24,920
sort of culture heroes that actually

01:10:22,820 --> 01:10:26,660
push Drupal out there's a lot of

01:10:24,920 --> 01:10:28,790
resources that could be developed as

01:10:26,660 --> 01:10:32,000
well online but I really feel as though

01:10:28,790 --> 01:10:33,920
engaging with communities university's

01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:36,890
high schools providing training

01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:39,950
opportunities and potentially adding a

01:10:36,890 --> 01:10:41,930
new role on google.org for local chapter

01:10:39,950 --> 01:10:44,660
organizer that would allow them to have

01:10:41,930 --> 01:10:46,760
a communications network and at extra

01:10:44,660 --> 01:10:48,950
resources available to help them in the

01:10:46,760 --> 01:10:50,030
advocacy of Drupal so yeah I feel as

01:10:48,950 --> 01:10:51,770
though that something with the community

01:10:50,030 --> 01:10:56,540
needs to do and that it means to happen

01:10:51,770 --> 01:11:01,790
on the ground this is chris mcgrath i

01:10:56,540 --> 01:11:07,400
can jump in hi this home yes Kristen tom

01:11:01,790 --> 01:11:10,220
I bet pumpkin sure um yeah no I agree

01:11:07,400 --> 01:11:13,070
with Richie tin and I agree you know

01:11:10,220 --> 01:11:16,790
with Alex as well I you have you know I

01:11:13,070 --> 01:11:18,110
myself of taking steps to I mean I want

01:11:16,790 --> 01:11:19,970
to get everybody i know you drupal

01:11:18,110 --> 01:11:22,130
basically i was talking my waiter you

01:11:19,970 --> 01:11:24,440
work with wordpress part-time forget

01:11:22,130 --> 01:11:26,030
that drupal you know et cetera et cetera

01:11:24,440 --> 01:11:29,180
and it is that kind of passionate thing

01:11:26,030 --> 01:11:31,580
when you know we went to revive the user

01:11:29,180 --> 01:11:34,970
group here in our area which is the

01:11:31,580 --> 01:11:37,100
state capitol of our state you know it's

01:11:34,970 --> 01:11:39,440
important it's important that government

01:11:37,100 --> 01:11:41,870
here is aware of a true pol knows its

01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:44,210
strong knows it's thriving we did also

01:11:41,870 --> 01:11:46,040
take concerted efforts such as Chris did

01:11:44,210 --> 01:11:47,720
you know to make sure Oh actually we

01:11:46,040 --> 01:11:49,070
were lucky the only folks that were

01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:50,660
really paying any attention you were

01:11:49,070 --> 01:11:53,420
like the academics and we haven't have a

01:11:50,660 --> 01:11:55,610
few colleges but but taking that and we

01:11:53,420 --> 01:11:57,530
formed our own nonprofit Drupal

01:11:55,610 --> 01:11:59,690
Institute I work and got together with

01:11:57,530 --> 01:12:01,850
chris from build a module said hey know

01:11:59,690 --> 01:12:03,680
you've got content need to get

01:12:01,850 --> 01:12:05,840
certifications we need to get people out

01:12:03,680 --> 01:12:08,270
there any of study groups you know can

01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:12,530
all be controlled by Acquia you know the

01:12:08,270 --> 01:12:14,600
one you know financed entity you know

01:12:12,530 --> 01:12:16,970
what can dreams do to get involved in

01:12:14,600 --> 01:12:20,000
things like Cobourg so we are you know

01:12:16,970 --> 01:12:22,850
taking it from the college cs department

01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:24,350
level out to the marketing departments

01:12:22,850 --> 01:12:27,260
you know where we get there other fifty

01:12:24,350 --> 01:12:30,679
percent of our decision makers

01:12:27,260 --> 01:12:32,269
for client contracts and down to you

01:12:30,679 --> 01:12:34,639
know the high schools in the middle

01:12:32,269 --> 01:12:36,170
schools I mean might my kids are six and

01:12:34,639 --> 01:12:38,510
nine and they're hearing from Zuckerberg

01:12:36,170 --> 01:12:40,639
you know how to animate an angry bird

01:12:38,510 --> 01:12:42,230
across the screen and their coding

01:12:40,639 --> 01:12:44,239
they're doing this and by the time

01:12:42,230 --> 01:12:46,820
they're 15 I'm going to build on what I

01:12:44,239 --> 01:12:49,190
do for crying law so you know it is

01:12:46,820 --> 01:12:51,889
possible and it is and I don't believe

01:12:49,190 --> 01:12:53,690
also just within the youth I think we've

01:12:51,889 --> 01:12:56,329
got a lot of PHP developers out there

01:12:53,690 --> 01:12:59,389
still that have not been sold on Drupal

01:12:56,329 --> 01:13:01,730
nor not sure are not you know helping to

01:12:59,389 --> 01:13:03,829
contribute to grow the talent pool which

01:13:01,730 --> 01:13:05,929
in reality is really if you want to

01:13:03,829 --> 01:13:08,619
answer what what is the other biggest

01:13:05,929 --> 01:13:11,750
barrier product success it's that again

01:13:08,619 --> 01:13:14,869
lack of resources as Richard said you

01:13:11,750 --> 01:13:17,750
know really every day I mean basically

01:13:14,869 --> 01:13:19,730
think about what can we do and I you

01:13:17,750 --> 01:13:22,550
know other than to reach out cultivate

01:13:19,730 --> 01:13:24,380
create scholarships you know cetera what

01:13:22,550 --> 01:13:27,530
you know that's it it's an on-the-ground

01:13:24,380 --> 01:13:29,210
thing basically as well as the marketing

01:13:27,530 --> 01:13:33,849
campaigns I think that is a fantastic

01:13:29,210 --> 01:13:33,849
idea also that alex has had amongst many

01:13:36,550 --> 01:13:44,900
hi this is Tom thanks Tom go for it hi

01:13:42,829 --> 01:13:45,980
this is Tom when I first came to Drupal

01:13:44,900 --> 01:13:48,110
it was an eye-opener for me watching

01:13:45,980 --> 01:13:50,510
kids camped on laptops a triple cons

01:13:48,110 --> 01:13:52,519
huddled in halls it was really cool to

01:13:50,510 --> 01:13:54,380
see but they've gone from being the

01:13:52,519 --> 01:13:57,019
majority to the minority and a lot of

01:13:54,380 --> 01:13:58,579
these cons once the suit start showing

01:13:57,019 --> 01:14:00,230
up the kids started disappearing and I

01:13:58,579 --> 01:14:01,969
can't imagine the kids in camo shorts

01:14:00,230 --> 01:14:05,119
and the skater shirts started wearing

01:14:01,969 --> 01:14:07,579
suits is they became more immersed in

01:14:05,119 --> 01:14:10,250
the Drupal community but as Alex said

01:14:07,579 --> 01:14:12,139
schools are really a great place to

01:14:10,250 --> 01:14:15,139
start I personally taught high school

01:14:12,139 --> 01:14:16,849
for 10 years help vocational schools to

01:14:15,139 --> 01:14:19,400
our web development classes before I

01:14:16,849 --> 01:14:21,199
even heard of Drupal here in the United

01:14:19,400 --> 01:14:23,389
States their vocational schools and

01:14:21,199 --> 01:14:26,059
comprehensive high schools the teachers

01:14:23,389 --> 01:14:27,889
who in many cases have no curriculum to

01:14:26,059 --> 01:14:29,630
follow when it comes to web development

01:14:27,889 --> 01:14:32,150
you know just as Cisco grabbed a

01:14:29,630 --> 01:14:34,579
foothold in these schools so can Drupal

01:14:32,150 --> 01:14:36,619
one there's a huge outreach and right

01:14:34,579 --> 01:14:39,019
now for programmers with a co dot org

01:14:36,619 --> 01:14:41,150
that we could jump on the bandwagon with

01:14:39,019 --> 01:14:43,489
right now I'd love to see the

01:14:41,150 --> 01:14:45,320
triple Association reach out to schools

01:14:43,489 --> 01:14:48,409
worldwide to help kids become viable

01:14:45,320 --> 01:14:54,590
candidates for Drupal jobs by bringing

01:14:48,409 --> 01:14:59,000
drupal into the schools thank you love

01:14:54,590 --> 01:15:02,449
that my cooler hey I gots Michael yeah I

01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:04,190
think yes and I think one other

01:15:02,449 --> 01:15:06,199
important thing is what happens right

01:15:04,190 --> 01:15:08,120
now with Triple Eight before triple

01:15:06,199 --> 01:15:10,790
seven be as the Drupal community had our

01:15:08,120 --> 01:15:12,860
own little let's call it unicorn that

01:15:10,790 --> 01:15:14,570
like especially the other PHP developers

01:15:12,860 --> 01:15:16,730
didn't really like or they talked bad

01:15:14,570 --> 01:15:19,550
about it because like everybody knows

01:15:16,730 --> 01:15:21,530
the learning curve if you type in Drupal

01:15:19,550 --> 01:15:26,290
learning curve in Google how that looks

01:15:21,530 --> 01:15:29,060
and I think with Drupal 8 we we started

01:15:26,290 --> 01:15:32,300
to come together with the PHP community

01:15:29,060 --> 01:15:35,210
we have now Symphony tracks on on our

01:15:32,300 --> 01:15:37,250
Drupal cons we had in Amsterdam where I

01:15:35,210 --> 01:15:38,989
was part of the team with the first time

01:15:37,250 --> 01:15:40,790
had a PHP track which was not

01:15:38,989 --> 01:15:43,460
specifically about Drupal it was about

01:15:40,790 --> 01:15:46,790
PHP so the PHP community comes together

01:15:43,460 --> 01:15:48,949
and I think that's also really important

01:15:46,790 --> 01:15:51,170
that we as a drupal association also

01:15:48,949 --> 01:15:55,340
start to talk to the other associations

01:15:51,170 --> 01:15:59,600
inside of PHP to just get people being

01:15:55,340 --> 01:16:02,900
involved in PHP and not like Ruby and so

01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:05,030
because if the people can program HP and

01:16:02,900 --> 01:16:07,340
maybe they learn PHP a symphony for them

01:16:05,030 --> 01:16:10,400
it's really easy to jump over to Drupal

01:16:07,340 --> 01:16:12,530
because all the things they know from

01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:14,600
the state of the art programming

01:16:12,530 --> 01:16:16,880
languages as we know it from symphony

01:16:14,600 --> 01:16:20,300
they can use in Drupal so it's just much

01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:22,940
easier for them and to work with so i

01:16:20,300 --> 01:16:25,690
think as duble association we should use

01:16:22,940 --> 01:16:29,210
the momentum right now that happens and

01:16:25,690 --> 01:16:31,460
and bring that in to talk to others and

01:16:29,210 --> 01:16:33,710
educate people about about PHP in

01:16:31,460 --> 01:16:37,310
general and of course this can happen in

01:16:33,710 --> 01:16:42,500
schools and where the people are because

01:16:37,310 --> 01:16:44,929
I clearly and would say that these

01:16:42,500 --> 01:16:46,880
people they don't go to comms we should

01:16:44,929 --> 01:16:50,860
go to them and that happens at the ed

01:16:46,880 --> 01:16:50,860
schools Andy and the universities

01:16:52,210 --> 01:17:01,450
thanks Michael Adam or Kelly or Enzo

01:16:57,370 --> 01:17:04,330
I'll go yeah like I think that was Kelly

01:17:01,450 --> 01:17:06,850
first look at yeah you can go yeah this

01:17:04,330 --> 01:17:09,760
is this is Kelly um I really like the

01:17:06,850 --> 01:17:13,120
idea of putting together curriculum um

01:17:09,760 --> 01:17:14,680
it's an expansion of a simpler idea that

01:17:13,120 --> 01:17:17,920
I've been thinking about would be cool a

01:17:14,680 --> 01:17:22,360
lot of times in in our local Drupal

01:17:17,920 --> 01:17:26,320
group which meets every month rain or

01:17:22,360 --> 01:17:27,670
shine it's hard it does really well when

01:17:26,320 --> 01:17:29,620
there's an agenda and it's hard to

01:17:27,670 --> 01:17:31,360
always to make sure that there's a good

01:17:29,620 --> 01:17:33,190
agenda when you have a good agenda more

01:17:31,360 --> 01:17:35,410
people come when you don't when you have

01:17:33,190 --> 01:17:37,570
an agenda that's basically just saying

01:17:35,410 --> 01:17:39,280
leave the gender items in the comments

01:17:37,570 --> 01:17:40,930
and nobody comments then you know the

01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:42,700
same few people come and then it just

01:17:40,930 --> 01:17:46,270
becomes a you know event about work

01:17:42,700 --> 01:17:47,650
thing but so to fix that one of the

01:17:46,270 --> 01:17:51,250
things I was thinking it would be cool

01:17:47,650 --> 01:17:53,320
is if there were a collection of you

01:17:51,250 --> 01:17:57,520
know things you could do a presentation

01:17:53,320 --> 01:18:00,239
on you know a 15 minute slide deck that

01:17:57,520 --> 01:18:03,910
could be you know a pool of things for

01:18:00,239 --> 01:18:05,140
for people to draw from to do up to you

01:18:03,910 --> 01:18:07,210
know to work on their presentation

01:18:05,140 --> 01:18:08,950
skills or to you know to add to an

01:18:07,210 --> 01:18:11,050
agenda to just run through different

01:18:08,950 --> 01:18:14,020
things and I think that that could grow

01:18:11,050 --> 01:18:15,460
into a curriculum and I think it'd be

01:18:14,020 --> 01:18:18,850
really cool if the drupal association

01:18:15,460 --> 01:18:21,630
put some resources into that effort

01:18:18,850 --> 01:18:21,630
thank you

01:18:24,720 --> 01:18:30,400
hey it's Adam so yeah this is a really I

01:18:28,480 --> 01:18:32,550
love this question completely it's a

01:18:30,400 --> 01:18:33,970
come from a non-formal education

01:18:32,550 --> 01:18:36,460
background I've done a lot of

01:18:33,970 --> 01:18:38,950
educational work our company gives

01:18:36,460 --> 01:18:41,320
training in universities and and started

01:18:38,950 --> 01:18:43,450
to work with schools now there is

01:18:41,320 --> 01:18:45,490
actually an open it's called open Drupal

01:18:43,450 --> 01:18:47,230
a curriculum being developed in the UK I

01:18:45,490 --> 01:18:49,030
think the hardest thing with this is is

01:18:47,230 --> 01:18:50,320
globalizing it I think that in every

01:18:49,030 --> 01:18:52,480
country you can have a different

01:18:50,320 --> 01:18:54,640
scenario but I think probably one of the

01:18:52,480 --> 01:18:56,560
biggest things for me is is getting the

01:18:54,640 --> 01:18:58,780
the young people when they're really

01:18:56,560 --> 01:19:00,880
young like when their kids and I think

01:18:58,780 --> 01:19:03,580
part of that is actually about changing

01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:05,140
the approach in how you introduce people

01:19:03,580 --> 01:19:06,580
to Drupal so it's not really about a

01:19:05,140 --> 01:19:07,900
curriculum it's not about formal

01:19:06,580 --> 01:19:10,030
education it's about creating a

01:19:07,900 --> 01:19:11,830
non-formal space where people bring

01:19:10,030 --> 01:19:15,370
their laptops like in there we had a

01:19:11,830 --> 01:19:17,680
coder dojo recently wait where the young

01:19:15,370 --> 01:19:20,860
people using scratch scratch is an entry

01:19:17,680 --> 01:19:23,320
into PHP sre interpipe them and they

01:19:20,860 --> 01:19:24,820
could get into PHP as well and but

01:19:23,320 --> 01:19:27,160
because scratch is a completely

01:19:24,820 --> 01:19:29,200
different approach if we could develop

01:19:27,160 --> 01:19:31,150
something around Drupal in terms of site

01:19:29,200 --> 01:19:34,480
building information architecture

01:19:31,150 --> 01:19:36,660
thinking about what saw without having

01:19:34,480 --> 01:19:39,160
even specifically initially to touch

01:19:36,660 --> 01:19:41,350
drupal and it's in the form that we know

01:19:39,160 --> 01:19:43,600
it as I think this is where we could

01:19:41,350 --> 01:19:45,970
really get young people involved it's

01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:47,380
the accessibility to to the concepts and

01:19:45,970 --> 01:19:50,620
the really quite complex things that are

01:19:47,380 --> 01:19:51,820
involved in what Drupal is and so for me

01:19:50,620 --> 01:19:54,820
one of the things we're working with a

01:19:51,820 --> 01:19:57,820
local school is is to come up with an

01:19:54,820 --> 01:19:59,770
idea maybe of a distribution or as I say

01:19:57,820 --> 01:20:01,750
maybe in something built in a slightly

01:19:59,770 --> 01:20:03,760
different way that's really accessible

01:20:01,750 --> 01:20:06,100
to the youngest kids and then that

01:20:03,760 --> 01:20:07,660
that's like the stepping stone into into

01:20:06,100 --> 01:20:09,670
Drupal air don't think curriculum a

01:20:07,660 --> 01:20:11,770
great but they're very formal and I

01:20:09,670 --> 01:20:13,930
think the way most people learn drupal

01:20:11,770 --> 01:20:16,030
not sitting with one book or one

01:20:13,930 --> 01:20:18,100
curricula its filing all the resources

01:20:16,030 --> 01:20:19,450
out there and being pointed in the right

01:20:18,100 --> 01:20:22,120
directions and then learning the other

01:20:19,450 --> 01:20:24,880
bits for themselves this is something I

01:20:22,120 --> 01:20:31,540
could talk about all all day but i'll

01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:35,910
leave it there thanks Adam I think until

01:20:31,540 --> 01:20:35,910
and sure yeah and so

01:20:36,670 --> 01:20:42,489
yeah hi okay well this is a huge

01:20:39,250 --> 01:20:45,190
question and I team and the best thing

01:20:42,489 --> 01:20:49,660
we are doing that one else is using the

01:20:45,190 --> 01:20:52,330
global training days and so I maxima and

01:20:49,660 --> 01:20:54,880
I agree with Michael would say right now

01:20:52,330 --> 01:20:57,489
a new ballet will have a really

01:20:54,880 --> 01:21:00,370
attracted tools like Symphony Backman

01:20:57,489 --> 01:21:02,860
and others and now we can or soon we

01:21:00,370 --> 01:21:06,790
will create will be able to create some

01:21:02,860 --> 01:21:09,130
houses to so in terms of fancy tools I

01:21:06,790 --> 01:21:13,690
think we are ok and I think we just need

01:21:09,130 --> 01:21:15,910
to a I serve as a first step is include

01:21:13,690 --> 01:21:17,590
a little more structure in Drupal 8 a

01:21:15,910 --> 01:21:21,040
training day is providing more resources

01:21:17,590 --> 01:21:24,280
to the organizer in Drupal 20 days to

01:21:21,040 --> 01:21:26,230
prepare people in universities to use

01:21:24,280 --> 01:21:28,739
the new changes in the product in the

01:21:26,230 --> 01:21:32,020
platform for to play and that is my

01:21:28,739 --> 01:21:37,330
initial idea to try to bring your

01:21:32,020 --> 01:21:38,890
resources to juba community thanks

01:21:37,330 --> 01:21:48,130
Victor you want to get the last word in

01:21:38,890 --> 01:21:52,210
I love it so much so my main thought is

01:21:48,130 --> 01:21:54,730
to share more about events the multiple

01:21:52,210 --> 01:21:56,679
events and people attended them there

01:21:54,730 --> 01:22:00,219
were people that know something you

01:21:56,679 --> 01:22:02,890
about Drupal yeah so the more events we

01:22:00,219 --> 01:22:07,030
have the more people we will in the

01:22:02,890 --> 01:22:11,980
world yes this oh thank you thanks

01:22:07,030 --> 01:22:15,880
vector how are you guys well could have

01:22:11,980 --> 01:22:20,020
been a comedy of errors thank you thank

01:22:15,880 --> 01:22:23,560
you so much or for putting up with me at

01:22:20,020 --> 01:22:28,690
the beginning of it Paul and for wading

01:22:23,560 --> 01:22:31,270
through the no you go no you go portion

01:22:28,690 --> 01:22:32,770
of the call as well I love how polite

01:22:31,270 --> 01:22:35,050
you guys are with each other and I think

01:22:32,770 --> 01:22:38,170
one of the my favorite parts of this

01:22:35,050 --> 01:22:41,050
experience is just is has been seeing

01:22:38,170 --> 01:22:43,480
how supportive you are of each other and

01:22:41,050 --> 01:22:45,820
how that is so indicative of the Drupal

01:22:43,480 --> 01:22:48,330
community in general so thanks for

01:22:45,820 --> 01:22:49,650
