through essentially go through the

00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:05,670
sponsor event kit this has all of your

00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:07,589
answers as far as anything you need to

00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:08,610
know regarding setting up booths or

00:00:07,589 --> 00:00:11,219
fulfilling your benefits for your

00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:12,900
sponsorships we'll also take a quick

00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:14,400
look at the prospectus which is

00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:17,100
essentially the contract that you signed

00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,470
when you signed up to be a triple con

00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:21,449
sponsor and we'll go over some other

00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:23,609
announcements as far as things that

00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:26,160
relate to registration and hotels and

00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:29,160
and what to expect as far as making

00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,800
accommodations there so we'll just go

00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:34,730
ahead and dive right in the first thing

00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:37,710
I want to do is show you are a brand new

00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:40,050
drupalcon website that launched a couple

00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:42,030
weeks ago it's really beautiful cheeky

00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:44,670
monkey media out of Canada did the

00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:46,350
design on this and our internal team has

00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:49,500
been hard at work putting together a

00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:51,390
complete new backend system for all of

00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:54,090
the cons and events that that will be

00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:56,730
hosting on drupal.org it should give a

00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:59,129
lot of increased benefits to not only

00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:01,140
attendees but also sponsors as we can

00:00:59,129 --> 00:01:04,110
roll out these additional features of

00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:06,090
the website one of the nice things that

00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:09,450
that we've kind of focused on is we've

00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:12,090
redone the user interfaces is kind of

00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:14,040
more of the continuous scrolling so for

00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:15,960
instance you'll notice pages tend to be

00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:18,960
longer and we've consolidated the total

00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:20,670
number of pages down so the section of

00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,670
the website that you guys will probably

00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:25,200
be most interested in or the sponsors

00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:28,950
page which you can he see in the top

00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,810
right nav area of the menu and then

00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:33,329
there's a lot of information in the

00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:34,890
programming about and community sections

00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:36,060
too so while we're not going to go

00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:37,590
through every section of the website

00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:39,600
there are a few questions that often

00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:40,860
come up through sponsors and I just

00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,770
wanted to kind of show you where you can

00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:45,810
find some of these resources so if you

00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:47,880
go under about and travel you can find

00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:50,189
information about the venue you can find

00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:52,229
information about the hotels these are

00:01:50,189 --> 00:01:54,450
the hotel held hotels where we have

00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:57,360
arranged for large blocks of hotel rooms

00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:59,250
and these are very discounted rates we

00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,350
additionally have someone that we work

00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:04,320
with an agency called house Briscoe who

00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:05,460
helps manage large group reservations so

00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,899
for instance if you have a couple

00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:08,789
employees coming they can help you make

00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:11,489
sure that you have rooms reserved for

00:02:08,789 --> 00:02:12,870
your entire staff and I have their

00:02:11,489 --> 00:02:13,440
contact information in the slides when

00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:14,670
we get back

00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,810
or but you can just email them and

00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:17,400
they'll help you make sure that you get

00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:18,900
not only the right hotel that fits your

00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,430
needs at the right amount of rooms for

00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:22,950
the right about the nights they really

00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:23,940
take a lot of that worry out of it and

00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:25,020
again I just want to reiterate that

00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:28,560
they're kind of their name is house

00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:32,190
Crisco and so there's also an additional

00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:34,470
information about LAX the largest local

00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:37,680
airport and then if anybody is needing

00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:38,700
any visa invitation letters you can

00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,280
request that here on the website

00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:42,660
basically what happens is we need to

00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,480
know a little bit of information about

00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:47,610
you including your order number so it's

00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:49,590
it's not open yet once we have

00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:51,540
registration open you'll be able to

00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:53,940
submit these requests and these letters

00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:55,620
are issued every Friday so basically if

00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:58,080
you request the letter during the week

00:02:55,620 --> 00:03:02,700
you can expect to see your letter by

00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:06,930
Friday following friday the other thing

00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:10,260
i want to go i want to show you is the

00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:11,940
boss section of the website so the call

00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:13,650
for sessions is open but what's call for

00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:16,200
sessions closes and then the schedule is

00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:18,510
announced we will open the area to

00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:21,120
submit boss I strongly encourage people

00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:22,200
to submit both sessions one of the

00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,940
things that you really do need to be

00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,170
aware about is that they are very much

00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:27,510
more conversational they're not a

00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:28,830
presentation so there is an AV can't

00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:31,770
really do slides but if you have

00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:33,480
something that is a common problem or an

00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:35,459
issue that you're passionate about this

00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,989
is a really great place for you to kind

00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:41,520
of lead the conversation or start the

00:03:36,989 --> 00:03:43,350
conversation around that topic and if

00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:46,769
you're wondering about session

00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:49,170
submission you can submit a talk right

00:03:46,769 --> 00:03:51,000
here so submission is open until

00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:53,580
februari 27 so there's about a week and

00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,140
a half left and there's a variety of

00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:57,600
session tracks that you can submit your

00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:59,220
topic for and it just kind of walks you

00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:01,890
through that process additionally if

00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:04,019
you're looking for additional resources

00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:05,690
before you submit your talk you can

00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:08,700
always reach out to the track chairs

00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:10,100
they can help provide feedback on a

00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:12,989
topic you may be thinking about

00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:14,550
proceeding or they can give you a little

00:04:12,989 --> 00:04:16,230
bit more insight into what it is that

00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:20,609
they're looking for for for this

00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:22,950
individual con another thing that is

00:04:20,609 --> 00:04:25,030
kind of some somewhat new but some way

00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:27,010
as somewhat expected is we

00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:28,240
Summit's that happen on Monday so here's

00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:30,160
where you can find information about the

00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,620
summit's if you're a Drupal shop owner

00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,990
the business summit is a great place for

00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:36,580
your c-suite executives to come and kind

00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:39,040
of share some mixed common experiences

00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:40,240
and learn from each other a new summit

00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:43,270
that we're doing this year is the higher

00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:45,400
education summit so it's really aimed at

00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:47,200
people that are involved with Drupal at

00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:49,120
the higher education university level

00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:50,860
and then the community summit so if you

00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,050
someone on your staff is really involved

00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:55,240
in community development within your

00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:56,980
local or regional Drupal community it's

00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:58,510
a really great day to kind of come

00:04:56,980 --> 00:05:01,030
together with people from all over the

00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:03,040
US and the world and learn about what's

00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:04,540
going on in other places so I just

00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:09,160
wanted to point those out is a really

00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:10,630
cool opportunity for people and then

00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:12,430
we're going to go finally under the

00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:15,700
probably most pertinent section the

00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:18,280
sponsors page so if you scroll down this

00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:21,400
page you can kind of see where we have

00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:23,320
everybody laid out by sponsorship level

00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:26,490
so we have your logo up and it links to

00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:29,160
your web page so if you click on that

00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:32,680
it'll take you right to your home page

00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:35,410
and if you see something and you're like

00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:38,440
oh no we have a new logo feel free to

00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:40,270
let Tim no Tim is our webmaster when it

00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:43,300
comes to sponsor logos and so if you

00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:45,100
have a question about your logo or maybe

00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:47,020
you have a drupalcon specific landing

00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:49,150
page that you want your logo to link to

00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:51,700
he can help you with all of those those

00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:54,310
needs and the way that these logos are

00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:55,990
set up is there they're limited by width

00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:57,400
and height so maybe you're seeing a

00:05:55,990 --> 00:06:00,190
vertical orientation and you'd rather

00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:01,539
have a horizontal orientation not a

00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:03,640
problem at all just provide us with the

00:06:01,539 --> 00:06:09,850
updated file and we'll make sure that it

00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:11,440
gets up gets up there on the website all

00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:13,570
right great so I think what we'll jump

00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:17,050
into next is our Los Angeles sponsor

00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:19,960
event kit a little bit bigger for you

00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:22,990
okay so this is the event kit this came

00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:24,910
out in an email from Tim last week and

00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:26,740
we're at the prop we're adding another

00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:28,419
page or adding some more information to

00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:31,090
our sponsor page on the website so that

00:06:28,419 --> 00:06:32,440
you can easily find these links there

00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:34,120
the team right now is hard at work

00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:36,640
trying to launch reg in the next few

00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:38,140
days which is very exciting so what's

00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,830
registration is open then we will be

00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:41,200
able to

00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:43,030
to get these other pages up and and

00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:45,640
you'll have that easy access to the

00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:47,200
event kit as well as other resources but

00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:48,850
we'll be sure and send out this link in

00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:51,730
our follow-up email so you have it easy

00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:53,620
at hand so the drupal con los angeles

00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:55,810
sponsor event kit it's a very long

00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:56,920
document but basically has kind of

00:06:55,810 --> 00:07:00,700
everything you need to know about

00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:03,010
sponsoring drupalcon so the front page

00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:04,510
you can kind of see here we're in this

00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:06,460
webinar right now but there is another

00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:08,140
webinar coming up in about a month and

00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:10,810
that's about how to maximize your

00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:14,230
sponsorship investment so basically that

00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:16,600
webinar will cover ways to build brand

00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:18,970
awareness to focus on lead generations

00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:21,190
and different strategies that have

00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:22,600
worked for people in the past and kind

00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:25,030
of give a little bit more background on

00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:26,770
the drupalcon event itself this is

00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:30,460
really more about the nuts and bolts of

00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:31,690
getting all of your benefits excuse me

00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:34,780

00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:50,110
these resources that you may need ok so

00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:52,240
then we get into the table of contents

00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:54,700
and this is kind of an easy way to kind

00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,770
of navigate this really large document

00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:59,200
and the first section that will get into

00:07:56,770 --> 00:08:01,360
it has a lot of important dates for a

00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:03,490
kind of a broad range of sponsors and

00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:06,340
then we get into the module sponsorships

00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:08,470
so if you maybe your coffee break

00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:10,450
sponsor or maybe your sponsored the

00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:12,850
power of stations there will be details

00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:15,370
there's specific to your sponsorship so

00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:17,740
if you can provide branded cocktail

00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:19,720
napkins or table tents or whatever it is

00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:21,670
that it comes with your sponsorship

00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:23,680
there will be details under each of

00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:25,690
those sections that show that kind of

00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:28,210
shows you how to either produce the

00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:29,710
event or produce the collateral or with

00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:34,090
us to produce a collateral and how to

00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:35,229
get it to the convention center and then

00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:37,270
we have a section on the exhibit hall

00:08:35,229 --> 00:08:39,970
this will be very important for anyone

00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:42,160
who has space in the exhibit hall so our

00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:43,270
correspond sirs so if you have a booth

00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:45,070
this is going to have a lot of the

00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:47,530
details you need to know as far as when

00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:49,810
you can get in and out of the hall when

00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:52,870
your setups time times are when it's

00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:54,970
time to tear down what to expect on site

00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:57,430
and then there's just some general

00:08:54,970 --> 00:09:00,550
information about Drupal con los angeles

00:08:57,430 --> 00:09:02,260
and information for you as far as

00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:05,140
registering your employees or how to

00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:06,460
pick up badges also reminding you that

00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:07,990
you're more than welcome to schedule a

00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:09,610
meeting with your account manager so

00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:11,500
dawn and johanna will definitely be

00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:14,040
there and we have a new account manager

00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:16,600
rachel rivera who will be there as well

00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:18,070
and then this is kind of the least

00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,779
glamorous but probably the most

00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:23,380
important section of the event kit

00:09:19,779 --> 00:09:25,270
shipping instructions so each each kind

00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:27,460
of different realm of what your what

00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:29,680
your shipping items for has different

00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:31,600
shipping instructions and the reason for

00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:34,420
that really is is basically when is the

00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:36,640
item needed so if we're using if you're

00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:38,500
using shipping things for your booth you

00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:40,200
won't need that until monday morning but

00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:42,580
for instance if you're shipping a

00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:44,290
branded tote bag item if you're one of

00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:46,420
the sponsors who can contribute an item

00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:47,890
to the tote bag I we need that the

00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:49,480
weekend before so that we can put those

00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:52,510
into the tote bags and have those ready

00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:54,880
for when registration opens on site so

00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:56,380
just be really cognizant of what it is

00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:58,360
that you're shipping and and which

00:09:56,380 --> 00:10:00,130
instructions you should be following and

00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:02,380
again if you have any questions on that

00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:05,080
as we get closer to the to the date

00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:07,420
please feel free to reach out to Tim and

00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:08,920
he is more than happy to help you wade

00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:10,810
through these instructions and make sure

00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:14,860
that you have have the right information

00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:16,390
in front of you so I'll kind of go

00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:18,580
through some of these important dates

00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:20,190
and fulfilling your benefits some of

00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:22,900
them are a little more specific to

00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:24,790
individual module sponsors so I'm a kind

00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:26,709
of breeze past those and focus on the

00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:28,240
ones that are more pertinent to the

00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:30,100
wider variety of the audience that

00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:33,130
people that have correspond sir ships

00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:34,750
and booths so this is though about your

00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:36,660
sponsor benefits webinar so

00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:38,589
congratulations you're already here

00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:41,260
you've got the first thing on the

00:10:38,589 --> 00:10:43,690
deadline most done the next thing up is

00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:45,790
the business showcase session so the

00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:48,730
business showcase session is available

00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:50,230
to some sponsors and then their varying

00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:52,270
lengths of sessions so it can be a

00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:55,029
15-minute a 30 minute or a 60 minute

00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:56,770
session and there's a whole section in

00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:58,240
the vent kit about posting your business

00:10:56,770 --> 00:11:00,370
showcase sessions so we'll kind of go

00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,890
into the details there but it's really

00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:04,300
important that you post your session as

00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:05,800
promptly as possible and if you'll

00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:06,819
notice that deadline is really about a

00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,889
week away

00:11:06,819 --> 00:11:11,049
the reason why we have it set up that

00:11:08,889 --> 00:11:14,139
way is that then would we post the

00:11:11,049 --> 00:11:16,299
session scheduled for the greater

00:11:14,139 --> 00:11:19,059
conference programming the whole

00:11:16,299 --> 00:11:20,739
conference program your sessions get the

00:11:19,059 --> 00:11:24,100
most amount of traffic if it's live

00:11:20,739 --> 00:11:25,989
before we publish the schedule so really

00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:27,729
it seems a little bit of a ways out but

00:11:25,989 --> 00:11:29,739
at the same time that will get you the

00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:32,799
most amount of seats and the seats as

00:11:29,739 --> 00:11:35,199
they say so send us your print ready a

00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:36,939
vector logo for the most part we should

00:11:35,199 --> 00:11:38,709
have your logo on file at this point

00:11:36,939 --> 00:11:40,689
unless tim has reached out to you about

00:11:38,709 --> 00:11:42,999
it it is imperative that we have a

00:11:40,689 --> 00:11:46,629
vector copy of the logo so that means

00:11:42,999 --> 00:11:50,199
the file format as PDF hie PS or

00:11:46,629 --> 00:11:52,479
possibly fact if the reason why we need

00:11:50,199 --> 00:11:54,069
to have your vector logo is that it's

00:11:52,479 --> 00:11:55,600
particularly for including it on

00:11:54,069 --> 00:11:57,220
conference branding we want to make sure

00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:00,249
that you have the greatest integrity of

00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:01,869
your artwork and so that everybody has

00:12:00,249 --> 00:12:03,759
seen you know a logo with two well

00:12:01,869 --> 00:12:05,229
resolution that's blown up too big and

00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:06,220
it just looks terrible and we just

00:12:05,229 --> 00:12:08,369
really want to make sure that we're

00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:11,049
putting you know your best face forward

00:12:08,369 --> 00:12:12,549
so feel free to fall victim if you have

00:12:11,049 --> 00:12:14,589
any questions or if you're planning a

00:12:12,549 --> 00:12:16,059
rebrand between now and Los Angeles

00:12:14,589 --> 00:12:17,439
please let us know because that's

00:12:16,059 --> 00:12:20,350
something that we can look into

00:12:17,439 --> 00:12:23,589
deadlines for and see when are kind of

00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:25,539
drop dead dates as far as new artwork so

00:12:23,589 --> 00:12:27,100
please be pretty proactive on letting us

00:12:25,539 --> 00:12:32,199
know if you anticipate a change between

00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:34,929
now and the con another set of important

00:12:32,199 --> 00:12:37,809
deadlines is for your pretty ads so

00:12:34,929 --> 00:12:40,720
quite a few sponsors have either quarter

00:12:37,809 --> 00:12:43,059
page or half page our full page print

00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:45,399
ads and the program guide their the

00:12:43,059 --> 00:12:47,739
deadline for that is March 16th so

00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:49,629
that's about a month away and there is a

00:12:47,739 --> 00:12:52,629
whole section on the print guy or excuse

00:12:49,629 --> 00:12:54,579
me the program guide and what a size

00:12:52,629 --> 00:12:56,019
specifications we have for the artwork

00:12:54,579 --> 00:13:00,159
if you have any questions on that you

00:12:56,019 --> 00:13:02,679
can always reach out to Tim we have your

00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:04,119
name company name as it should appear in

00:13:02,679 --> 00:13:08,139
print but for instance if you're

00:13:04,119 --> 00:13:10,839
choosing to put sponsor as problem maybe

00:13:08,139 --> 00:13:13,389
like a product line or a spin-off of

00:13:10,839 --> 00:13:15,789
your host company please just feel free

00:13:13,389 --> 00:13:17,319
to clarify that with Tim but as of now I

00:13:15,789 --> 00:13:19,029
believe that we have that confirmation

00:13:17,319 --> 00:13:21,380
from your sales rep and your sales

00:13:19,029 --> 00:13:23,610
contract

00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:26,519
okay so the next thing on the list is

00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:28,380
send us your awesome web ads so we love

00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:30,870
to have your web ads as soon as possible

00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:33,389
for the LA website the site is live now

00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:36,810
and we really like to have those in

00:13:33,389 --> 00:13:38,579
place and uploaded by the time we by the

00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:39,870
time we post the schedule live that's

00:13:38,579 --> 00:13:41,459
when we get the greatest amount of

00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:43,889
traffic and we really want to maximize

00:13:41,459 --> 00:13:45,720
the number of impressions you have so if

00:13:43,889 --> 00:13:47,100
we have an out RIA received your web ad

00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:50,040
we will essentially put up a copy of

00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:51,449
your logo in this place until we receive

00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:53,610
that ad and I can tell you from

00:13:51,449 --> 00:13:55,380
experience you get a lot more traffic if

00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:57,540
you have a snazzy add up there instead

00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:58,889
of just a logo so we really want to make

00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:01,529
sure that you get as much out of that as

00:13:58,889 --> 00:14:03,990
possible and it feel free if you have a

00:14:01,529 --> 00:14:05,490
give us a triple conspecific landing

00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:07,380
page please feel free to provide that

00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:11,339
URL to tim when you email over the

00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:13,529
artwork ok the next item on this list is

00:14:11,339 --> 00:14:14,670
the attendee tote bag item so we need to

00:14:13,529 --> 00:14:16,920
know what you're at what you're

00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:18,540
contributing essentially you know you

00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:21,209
can just email tim and say we're

00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:23,220
contributing a flyer we have a pack of

00:14:21,209 --> 00:14:25,920
stickers or we have a glass or someone

00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:27,089
did gummy bears the one thing i will be

00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,620
sure and point out is that this doesn't

00:14:27,089 --> 00:14:30,329
apply to all sponsors so be sure and

00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:32,610
really pay attention to what your

00:14:30,329 --> 00:14:34,139
sponsorship package includes we want to

00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:36,000
make sure that that you don't get there

00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:38,189
and feel frustrated that oh i thought i

00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,170
was having these things included or or

00:14:38,189 --> 00:14:41,370
you realize that you could have had

00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:43,319
something included and you didn't

00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:44,910
capitalize on that opportunity so just

00:14:43,319 --> 00:14:47,730
be sure and take a look at what all

00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:48,930
comes with your sponsorship and actually

00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:50,670
while we're talking about that i'll just

00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:51,959
quick jump over so the way you can see

00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:53,730
what all comes with your sponsorship

00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:56,850
this is our what we call our sales

00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:58,589
prospectus this is essentially what you

00:14:56,850 --> 00:15:00,509
looked at with your sitting down with

00:14:58,589 --> 00:15:02,819
your sales rep and signing the paperwork

00:15:00,509 --> 00:15:05,779
to determine what sponsorship package

00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:07,920
work best for you and as you kind of

00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:09,420
scroll through the document here's where

00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:11,790
a lot of the details are for the core

00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:14,459
sponsorship so you can kind of look and

00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:17,600
say okay if I'm a gold sponsor these are

00:15:14,459 --> 00:15:20,459
what benefits apply to me so you get

00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:22,350
there's 12 gold sponsors you get eight

00:15:20,459 --> 00:15:25,110
tickets to drupalcon you have a

00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:26,759
ten-by-ten booth you get a quarter page

00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:28,649
ad so this is where you can kind of

00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:31,050
verify okay i know i need to provide a

00:15:28,649 --> 00:15:33,000
print ad but what size do i need what

00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:34,380
you know what for instance another

00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,050
thing where you can select a bonus if

00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:39,270
you've opted for bonus a okay I get to

00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:40,920
submit a business showcase session of 15

00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:43,080
minutes so this is where it is kind of

00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:44,610
your roadmap to laying out what all

00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:46,650
benefits you get with your core

00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:49,260
sponsorships and then as far as the

00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:51,480
module sponsorships go you can scroll

00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:54,210
down here and see all module

00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:55,590
sponsorships include these six benefits

00:15:54,210 --> 00:15:57,660
and then there's additional benefits

00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:59,040
listed below so just keep an eye on that

00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:01,230
and that way when you're looking at the

00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,400
event kit you can easily determine oh

00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:05,880
this is something that doesn't come with

00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:08,130
minor this is something that does so if

00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:09,840
we jump back to the event kit there's an

00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:11,700
additional webinar coming up in about a

00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:13,470
month from now again that's one that's

00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:15,120
more about maximizing your sponsorship

00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:17,160
investments so ways to kind of reach

00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:21,510
beyond there's the basic offense

00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:23,760
strategies as far as the next major

00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:25,380
deadlines that apply to the most people

00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:27,900
we really need to know your tracking

00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:29,880
numbers for shipped materials so April

00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:32,880
23rd is the deadline we have listed for

00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:35,070
that if you it sounds kind of trivial

00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:37,800
but if you can provide us with tracking

00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:40,800
numbers it is so helpful for us on sight

00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:43,350
if we're trying to locate a boss it's

00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:45,900
it's important to know it for booth

00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:47,640
collateral but at the same time the

00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:51,480
things that are extremely important are

00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:53,220
if you're providing branded items for

00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:56,160
like a catered event or if you're

00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:58,650
providing table tents for the power up

00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:00,900
tables or if you're providing a tote bag

00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:02,430
item we really need to know those

00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:05,400
tracking numbers because we have to be

00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:07,170
able to locate them on site and be able

00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,850
to be aware if they haven't made it yet

00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:10,380
so that we can reach out to you and we

00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:13,170
can work with your shipper and try and

00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:14,699
locate them so again you can email that

00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:17,100
information to Tim and it could be a

00:17:14,699 --> 00:17:20,610
simple email of you know sending four

00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:21,930
boxes stickers for the tote bags UPS is

00:17:20,610 --> 00:17:22,980
the shipper and here's the track of

00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:24,420
never it doesn't have to be a lot of

00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:26,400
detail but just so we know what we're

00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:31,140
looking for and from whom and what

00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:33,780
number and again this next deadline is

00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:34,980
related to the tote bag item so the one

00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:36,630
thing that you want to be aware of is

00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:39,510
the tote bag item does have an earlier

00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:41,640
rival deadline hook compared to other

00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:44,670
shipping items so just again really pay

00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:45,900
attention to the shipping details then

00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:49,860
deadlines that are

00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:51,990
cluded down in the shipping section for

00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:54,360
Los Angeles we will be offering a lead

00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:56,280
retrieval scanner like we did in Austin

00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:58,140
it's the same provider that we used in

00:17:56,280 --> 00:18:00,180
Austin they have been really great to

00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:03,600
work with and have been very affordable

00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:05,940
and have allowed us to include the right

00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:08,430
level of encryption that we need to give

00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:10,560
to provide our attendees that kind of

00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:13,470
sense of peace we really wanted to make

00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:15,240
sure that they had that the barcodes

00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:17,070
that we're using are not essentially

00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:18,420
scannable by any other devices so that

00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:21,600
people don't feel as though their

00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:23,310
information could be could be hijacked

00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:25,230
or something like that so it's a really

00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:26,760
great system and there's a whole section

00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:28,470
in here about how you can order your

00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:31,200
device and make sure that you have

00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:36,720
everything in place that when you show

00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:38,520
up your you're all good to go um so the

00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:41,640
next couple sections are a little bit

00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:46,320
more specific to individual sponsorships

00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:47,310
so if you're having a speaker present so

00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,570
for instance if they're introducing

00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:49,980
someone on the main stage or if they're

00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:51,990
talking during trivia night or opening

00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:53,730
reception please let us know who they

00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:56,280
are we need to know their name and phone

00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:57,480
number their local phone number so if

00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:59,400
ava cellphone that's working in los

00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:00,900
angeles and then their email address and

00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:02,220
that just helps us coordinate with them

00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:05,400
to make sure that if there's a rehearsal

00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:06,570
time they can make it and just ensure

00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:13,110
that we can find them on sight if

00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:15,210
there's if there's a problem if you have

00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:17,640
the opportunity to order a swag table

00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:19,350
for one of your module sponsorships

00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:22,170
please be sure and confirm that you do

00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:23,670
want that with Tim we will also reach

00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:25,470
out to you but just as a reminder to

00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:28,320
just we just need to know so that we can

00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:31,110
put in the order for it and as far as

00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:32,490
trivia night goes baby we would love it

00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:34,640
if you would be willing to contribute

00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:38,250
you know thoughtful or creative or

00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:40,290
drupal specific prices for the the

00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:42,030
trivia night contest and if you haven't

00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:43,920
participated in trivia night before it

00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:47,490
is a wonderful event and we have about

00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:50,730
500 people show up and everybody sets up

00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:52,890
in teams of five and they compete in

00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:55,350
kind of like a pub style trivia contest

00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:57,210
with like multiple rounds and go through

00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:59,010
the night trying to show off their their

00:19:57,210 --> 00:19:59,580
brain power with regards to Drupal or

00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:02,910
coding

00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:05,490
your community questions and so it's a

00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:07,350
really fun opportunity to include

00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:08,970
something any sponsor can do this so

00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:11,880
we've just simply request that you

00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:13,830
provide prices and sets of five and

00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:15,840
preferably four sets of five so we like

00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:17,790
to give prizes the top three teams and

00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:19,290
then the lowest team so that everybody

00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:22,500
kind of walks away with a good feeling

00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:24,600
and then probably one of the more fun

00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:27,360
things about being a sponsor we have a

00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:29,040
lovely sponsor happy hour and an

00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:31,620
appreciation night so that will be

00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:33,960
wednesday night during the con from 5 30

00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:35,790
to 7 30 we're still finalizing the

00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:38,520
details as to where it is but you are

00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:40,860
welcome to invite our to send two guests

00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:43,860
to the happy hour if you are also a

00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:46,080
drupal association either supporting

00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:47,760
partner technology supporter or hosting

00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,920
supporter you can send an additional two

00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:52,920
people so potentially four people total

00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:54,750
but everybody gets sent to it's a really

00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:57,390
great chance to meet the other sponsors

00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:59,760
there will be some of the DA staff trees

00:20:57,390 --> 00:21:02,340
will be there it's a really fun fun

00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:07,680
couple hours just kind of relax a half

00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:09,870
way through the event okay so then the

00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:13,140
next thing on the list is providing us

00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:15,660
any guest content for the DA newsfeed so

00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:17,520
we provide articles a couple a couple

00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:19,800
articles for per week and if you

00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:21,840
something that you want to provide you

00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:24,260
are more than welcome to send it along

00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,260
to Tim

00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:27,160
you

00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:34,820
okay the next thing is related to the

00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:36,350
developer contest so we'll kind of

00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:37,490
breeze over that for right now but

00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:38,870
there's a lot more information about the

00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:41,270
developer contest down in that section

00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:43,130
and then with every triple con we

00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:45,230
essentially have a Drupal chalkboard and

00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:47,570
with the launch of Drupal jobs last year

00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:50,360
instead of doing a conspecific job board

00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:52,490
we instead give you guys the coupon code

00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:55,040
in order to post as many jobs as you

00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:57,020
like for the month leading up to triple

00:21:55,040 --> 00:22:00,440
cons so you get all the functionality

00:21:57,020 --> 00:22:02,270
and features of triple jobs and can post

00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:04,990
away to your heart's delight and each

00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:08,090
job listing is live for 30 days and you

00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:10,310
can post jobs through the last day of

00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:12,200
the conference so when we're 30 days out

00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:15,290
Tim will email you that coupon code and

00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:17,570
you can simply log into Drupal jobs and

00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:23,420
then post any positions that you are

00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:26,050
hiring for so April seventeenth is our

00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:29,900
deadline for ordering a V catering

00:22:26,050 --> 00:22:31,370
materials and it's really a good date to

00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:33,410
keep in mind because that's after that

00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:35,630
date is when prices increase so if you

00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:37,220
order before seven to 17 you can

00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:39,650
capitalize on discounts that are out

00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:41,240
there after the 17th you can still get

00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:44,590
those services but you're probably going

00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:44,590
to pay a little bit of a higher rate

00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:47,490
you

00:22:48,889 --> 00:22:55,110
and the next section is about the

00:22:52,769 --> 00:22:57,529
attendee email copy so again this

00:22:55,110 --> 00:23:00,840
doesn't apply to all sponsors but the

00:22:57,529 --> 00:23:03,899
Diamonds receive a dedicated email and a

00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:06,330
handful I think three platinum email

00:23:03,899 --> 00:23:08,759
excuse me platinum sponsors share and

00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:10,559
email to attendees and so that section

00:23:08,759 --> 00:23:13,350
has details about providing that content

00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:15,659
and when those will be one of those will

00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:18,559
be sent to attendees and those are sent

00:23:15,659 --> 00:23:22,440
out to those who have opted in for

00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:24,809
communications from the sponsors the

00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:26,669
next is the 23rd so we will be sending

00:23:24,809 --> 00:23:28,590
out the attendee list to sponsors who

00:23:26,669 --> 00:23:31,169
have opted in for that benefit so again

00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:34,379
not all sponsorship levels include this

00:23:31,169 --> 00:23:37,919
but this attendee list is the first name

00:23:34,379 --> 00:23:40,350
last name title and company of those who

00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:41,940
are tending to your flick on you can use

00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:43,289
the list to kind of identify people that

00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:46,169
you may want to reach out to on a

00:23:43,289 --> 00:23:47,909
one-to-one basis you can see if there

00:23:46,169 --> 00:23:50,399
have a public profile on the con web

00:23:47,909 --> 00:23:52,230
page and contact them through that

00:23:50,399 --> 00:23:54,840
channel we really want to be careful

00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:57,210
though that people aren't kind of

00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:58,799
abusing this opportunity we want to make

00:23:57,210 --> 00:24:00,659
sure that the attendees don't feel as

00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:02,340
though they're being spammed or that

00:24:00,659 --> 00:24:03,600
they're being pestered so again it

00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:05,750
really is intended more pride of

00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:08,009
one-to-one outreach rather than

00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:11,029
something that kind of Cole's together a

00:24:08,009 --> 00:24:16,320
massive list and sends out mail major

00:24:11,029 --> 00:24:18,149
mailings and then the next few with the

00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:21,360
next few items are all to do with

00:24:18,149 --> 00:24:23,100
shipping with deadlines so again I would

00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:26,159
just really reiterate to check in that

00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:28,529
shipping information section and just

00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:30,149
find all of the details that that list

00:24:28,529 --> 00:24:33,059
that live there as far as like what your

00:24:30,149 --> 00:24:35,190
sponsorship is or what kind of

00:24:33,059 --> 00:24:38,039
collateral or what kind of item it is

00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:39,480
that your Sunday so then we kind of get

00:24:38,039 --> 00:24:42,870
into the breadth of the document where

00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:45,600
at the beginning there's details that

00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:48,029
kind of apply to core sponsors so for

00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:50,610
again here's the details about your

00:24:48,029 --> 00:24:53,009
program guide ad you can see here we've

00:24:50,610 --> 00:24:56,399
listed what level of sponsorship it is

00:24:53,009 --> 00:24:58,889
and what size the print ad is again make

00:24:56,399 --> 00:25:00,330
sure you know what what size it is that

00:24:58,889 --> 00:25:03,480
you

00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:06,269
receive with your benefits and here is

00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:07,649
since this deadline is coming up in the

00:25:06,269 --> 00:25:10,350
next week or so I just want to point

00:25:07,649 --> 00:25:12,059
this out so here is the link to submit

00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:15,090
your session for your business showcase

00:25:12,059 --> 00:25:18,059
session you need to be logged in to

00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:20,340

00:25:18,059 --> 00:25:23,039
la page to in order to post or edit the

00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:24,120
content but you can go there to submit

00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:25,890
the session and what you'll need to

00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:28,470
include is the title the kind of

00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:31,950
synopsis of the session and the speakers

00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:33,360
and again one of the one of the great

00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:34,830
things about these business showcase

00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:36,990
sessions is just like every other

00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:39,090
session that is presented at your pecan

00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:42,299
we record these sessions and post them

00:25:39,090 --> 00:25:44,070
to the triple con la a playlist on

00:25:42,299 --> 00:25:45,929
YouTube so everything is pretty much

00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:48,090
uploaded within you know a couple hours

00:25:45,929 --> 00:25:49,340
of completion but it's a really great

00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:51,539
opportunity to kind of have that

00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:55,200
presentation living out there and legacy

00:25:51,539 --> 00:25:57,240
and additionally we have some speaker

00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,590
resources so that would apply for

00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,840
whether you're doing a business showcase

00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:02,669
session or if you have people at your

00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:04,710
company who are have submitted sessions

00:26:02,669 --> 00:26:07,350
that have been accepted there's a lot of

00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:09,480
details in there as far as what to

00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:13,169
expect what you can find in the room

00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:14,669
there's templates for excuse me there's

00:26:13,169 --> 00:26:16,500
templates for like slides that you can

00:26:14,669 --> 00:26:20,490
download in a couple different file

00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:23,490
formats that's really helpful so I'm

00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:25,350
going to kind of skip down and then here

00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:26,789
is the module sponsorship so if you're

00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:27,840
the coffee break sponsor you can see

00:26:26,789 --> 00:26:30,120
there's a lot of details for that

00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:32,190
specifically and again you can kind of

00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:34,919
look up your individual sponsorships and

00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:37,649
see what your opportunities are when the

00:26:34,919 --> 00:26:39,389
deadlines are what you need to be

00:26:37,649 --> 00:26:42,720
communicating with Timlin or what he may

00:26:39,389 --> 00:26:45,380
be asking you for just going to keep

00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,380
cruising

00:26:52,690 --> 00:26:58,519
ok so this section is on site at drupal

00:26:56,450 --> 00:27:01,700
con la so this is where a lot of the

00:26:58,519 --> 00:27:04,100
meat and potatoes is as far as what to

00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:07,240
expect in the exhibit hall and what goes

00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:09,710
on throughout the week so here is our

00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:12,139
registration hours so essentially

00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:13,999
starting Sunday for the day before any

00:27:12,139 --> 00:27:15,529
kind of real on-site activities from

00:27:13,999 --> 00:27:18,620
three to six that's when you can start

00:27:15,529 --> 00:27:20,029
picking up registration packets so you

00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:22,610
can pick up your tote bags you can pick

00:27:20,029 --> 00:27:24,860
up your badges that kind of thing and so

00:27:22,610 --> 00:27:27,169
that runs essentially through Thursday

00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:29,919
afternoon when we have the start of the

00:27:27,169 --> 00:27:29,919
closing session

00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:32,210
you

00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:37,920
so our website team our tech team right

00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:39,960
now is furiously I work in the final

00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:41,940
stages of testing for a registration so

00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:43,860
online registration should open on the

00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:45,809
site within the next week or so and as

00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:48,090
soon as registration opens Tim will be

00:27:45,809 --> 00:27:49,890
emailing you coupon codes so that you

00:27:48,090 --> 00:27:51,510
can get all of your free tickets that

00:27:49,890 --> 00:27:54,030
you receive as a part of your

00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:55,650
sponsorship package so the way that that

00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:58,650
works is essentially if you have eat

00:27:55,650 --> 00:28:01,140
free tickets for triple con that coupon

00:27:58,650 --> 00:28:04,679
code will will allow you to purchase up

00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:07,140
to eight tickets with that free price if

00:28:04,679 --> 00:28:09,120
you need to purchase any tickets beyond

00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:11,340
what you get for free you are more than

00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:14,670
welcome to do that and you can do that

00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:16,800
at the early bird rate so once the

00:28:14,670 --> 00:28:18,660
ticket price changes on the website and

00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:20,880
increases from our early bird rate to

00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:22,530
our regular rate Tim will again be

00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:25,410
emailing you out a coupon code that will

00:28:22,530 --> 00:28:28,740
like allow you to add tickets to your

00:28:25,410 --> 00:28:31,650
cart at that early bird price and I want

00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:34,020
to reiterate how important it is for you

00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:36,620
and your staff to register online and

00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:38,640
preferably in advance of the event

00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:41,250
registering on site we can totally

00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:43,320
facilitate but it's a lot smoother if

00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:46,500
you're able to register on the site

00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:48,720
preferably you know Italy he's two weeks

00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:50,640
to four weeks out it just really helps

00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:52,710
us with being able to project catering

00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:55,620
numbers and helps us keep lost costs low

00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:57,120
that way but also it allows them to be

00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:59,790
in kind of our mass printing of the

00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:01,020
badges so often they they kind of look a

00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:03,780
little bit snazzy or when they come

00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:05,309
directly from the printing press so be

00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:06,660
sure and have everyone register in

00:29:05,309 --> 00:29:09,830
advance and you guys will all be in

00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:12,420
tip-top shape when you show up on site

00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:14,190
that said if you have a late addition to

00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:16,340
your team who is coming on site they can

00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:18,750
register on site with your coupon code

00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:20,330
they can just make sure that they have

00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:22,740
the coupon code available and they

00:29:20,330 --> 00:29:29,520
mention that when they're trying to sign

00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:31,020
up in the registration area ok so then

00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:32,309
here's another reminder feel free to

00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:34,770
schedule a meeting with your account

00:29:32,309 --> 00:29:36,360
manager everybody is on site and eager

00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:38,490
to connect and then while I'm sure

00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:40,710
everyone will see see each other well

00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:41,500
throughout the week and in the hallways

00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:42,760
and

00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:44,650
running two lunches and things like that

00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:46,780
feel free to reach out I know that they

00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:49,500
love being able to connect face-to-face

00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:51,880
and spend some time with each of their

00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:53,260
partners and accounts so it's a really

00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:58,150
great time to have that face-to-face

00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:59,410
time with Don Johanna and Rachel okay so

00:29:58,150 --> 00:30:01,570
here's some more details about the

00:29:59,410 --> 00:30:04,030
exhibit hall so load in and set up is

00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:06,640
Monday the day before the con from nine

00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:08,830
a.m. to four p.m. it's really important

00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:11,770
that you plan on being fully set up by

00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:15,850
about four o'clock starting as soon as

00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:17,680
five the the hall opens for the opening

00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:19,630
reception and the opening reception is

00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:21,130
just a really really fabulous time to

00:30:19,630 --> 00:30:22,810
get a lot of traffic through your booth

00:30:21,130 --> 00:30:25,060
and kind of set the tone for what your

00:30:22,810 --> 00:30:26,890
company is doing throughout the week so

00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:28,120
I just want to reiterate that the event

00:30:26,890 --> 00:30:31,020
hall or the excuse me the exhibit hall

00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:33,160
is open on Monday night and it's really

00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:34,720
really smart to capitalize on that and

00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:36,190
make sure your booth is well stocked and

00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:38,560
that you guys are ready to go and

00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:40,690
everything has been set up and boxes

00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:42,250
will be have been taken away and so that

00:30:40,690 --> 00:30:44,170
that's just really an important thing to

00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:46,000
keep in your mind that while monday is

00:30:44,170 --> 00:30:49,450
setup day it's also the first day of the

00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:51,190
con and so here's the exhibit hall hours

00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:52,900
people often are curious about what

00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:55,600
hours they should have their staff ready

00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:57,100
to be on site so essentially the exhibit

00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:59,140
hall opens in the morning after the

00:30:57,100 --> 00:31:02,770
keynote session wraps and it generally

00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:05,710
it's about 10-15 to 1030 so go ahead and

00:31:02,770 --> 00:31:07,330
count on people starting to stream in

00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:09,940
looking for that coffee almost as soon

00:31:07,330 --> 00:31:14,550
as that session breaks and then again

00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:14,550
it's open until six p.m. each evening

00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:19,760
you

00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:26,070
okay so then we have information for

00:31:23,370 --> 00:31:28,290
tear down and move out so tear down

00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:30,180
essentially starts once the closing

00:31:28,290 --> 00:31:32,130
session begins so at about 3 30 on

00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:34,380
thursday the key the closing session

00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:35,880
kicks off in the keynote room and at

00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:38,700
that point you're basically free to tear

00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:41,430
down box things up ship things out and

00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:44,370
freeman is our show decorator and they

00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:46,230
are they do a fabulous job of if you

00:31:44,370 --> 00:31:48,060
want to store things throughout the show

00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:50,400
they can bring it back on Thursday for

00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:51,990
you to tear down or if you just want to

00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:54,120
arrange for them to ship a box back or

00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:57,090
ship a booth back there they're

00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:58,230
extremely helpful and so they I highly

00:31:57,090 --> 00:31:59,970
recommend reaching out to them in

00:31:58,230 --> 00:32:01,290
advance but they also will have people

00:31:59,970 --> 00:32:04,500
on site that you can talk to you if you

00:32:01,290 --> 00:32:08,040
prefer to just do it face-to-face but

00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:09,330
again if you can capitalize on some just

00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:12,300
kind of pricing if you arrange for those

00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:13,860
things in advance okay the exhibitor

00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:15,570
hall excuse me the exhibit hall floor

00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:17,460
plan we're working on that currently in

00:32:15,570 --> 00:32:19,200
booth selection has started so you will

00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:22,530
receive an email from Tim when it's your

00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:25,230
turn to select a booth and essentially

00:32:22,530 --> 00:32:26,910
we ask for three booths numbers and

00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:28,350
order of preference and we try to

00:32:26,910 --> 00:32:30,270
obviously give you your first choice

00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:32,190
first and go down the list from there

00:32:30,270 --> 00:32:33,840
the reason why we ask for three is we

00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:35,460
try to have three sponsors selecting at

00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:38,340
once in order to kind of expedite the

00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:40,200
process as much as we possibly can and

00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:41,700
once the exhibit hall floor plan is

00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:43,890
final you will see that posted on our

00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:46,950
website it'll be updated in this

00:32:43,890 --> 00:32:50,430
document and it's what will be printed

00:32:46,950 --> 00:32:53,160
in the program guide so here is what

00:32:50,430 --> 00:32:54,780
comes with your booth so essentially the

00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:56,750
size is determined by your sponsorship

00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:59,220
levels so that diamonds and platinum

00:32:56,750 --> 00:33:00,930
have a little bit larger booth you can

00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:02,760
see that information there the other

00:33:00,930 --> 00:33:05,550
booths are essentially ten feet by ten

00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:14,220
feet and you can see a little graphic of

00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:16,050
what a booth set up link here it is the

00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:19,440
industry standard exhibitor booths size

00:33:16,050 --> 00:33:22,080
regulations we are using this industry

00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:31,149
document to help us kind of manage the

00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:32,589
booth opportunity to be to have to

00:33:31,149 --> 00:33:36,009
their company off and their goods off

00:33:32,589 --> 00:33:37,479
and these require these regulations just

00:33:36,009 --> 00:33:39,999
really help make sure that we have a

00:33:37,479 --> 00:33:41,619
standard for you know audio levels or

00:33:39,999 --> 00:33:44,049
sight lines or that kind of thing and

00:33:41,619 --> 00:33:45,549
really it's just you guys are so so

00:33:44,049 --> 00:33:48,700
incredibly creative that we want to make

00:33:45,549 --> 00:33:50,859
sure that that 11 sponsors creativity

00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:53,049
does not interfere with another sponsors

00:33:50,859 --> 00:33:54,779
experience and so I don't think there's

00:33:53,049 --> 00:33:57,909
anything in there that would be

00:33:54,779 --> 00:33:59,739
surprising or out of line from things

00:33:57,909 --> 00:34:00,849
that you've seen at previous cons that

00:33:59,739 --> 00:34:02,529
it's just something that we can use to

00:34:00,849 --> 00:34:04,479
kind of work with people if something

00:34:02,529 --> 00:34:07,479
should arise where there was a

00:34:04,479 --> 00:34:09,849
disagreement and the one thing I really

00:34:07,479 --> 00:34:12,760
also this is a really important and a

00:34:09,849 --> 00:34:15,099
big change from years past this year we

00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:17,230
are the electrical must be ordered by

00:34:15,099 --> 00:34:19,480
the sponsors so we just selected our

00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:21,760
electrical vendor last week and I will

00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:23,980
be excuse me Tim will be emailing out

00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:26,710
that information probably by the end of

00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:28,270
this week or mid next week as far as how

00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:30,309
you can order that service that you will

00:34:28,270 --> 00:34:33,010
need to submit those orders in order to

00:34:30,309 --> 00:34:35,020
have electricity at your booth so

00:34:33,010 --> 00:34:36,369
whereas in the past you would show up

00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:38,109
and there would be you know a power

00:34:36,369 --> 00:34:40,149
strip and there'd be electrical supply

00:34:38,109 --> 00:34:41,980
this year you need to order that and

00:34:40,149 --> 00:34:44,500
it's preferential that you order it in

00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:49,990
advance and capitalize on those cost

00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:51,639
savings so there is a information in

00:34:49,990 --> 00:34:53,710
here about how to order carpeting you

00:34:51,639 --> 00:34:55,389
are more than welcome to order carpeting

00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:58,029
through Freeman you may also bring your

00:34:55,389 --> 00:35:02,770
own flooring material but we do request

00:34:58,029 --> 00:35:04,390
that flooring is provided so Freeman is

00:35:02,770 --> 00:35:06,880
our show decorator they were who we used

00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:09,760
in Austin so if you use them there you

00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:11,650
are pretty familiar with their way of

00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:13,059
operating their great provider and they

00:35:11,650 --> 00:35:16,420
have an excellent level of customer

00:35:13,059 --> 00:35:18,279
service they have a full online store

00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:21,400
that you can use to order your goods and

00:35:18,279 --> 00:35:23,079
services once we select your booth then

00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:24,640
you will be able to access that store

00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:26,619
essentially they need your booth number

00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:28,240
in order to set up your account on there

00:35:26,619 --> 00:35:30,670
so that you can order whatever whatever

00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:32,200
it is that you may like and so this

00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:33,849
exhibitor kit that that will put the

00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:37,059
link in here soon that should be within

00:35:33,849 --> 00:35:38,680
like a week or so that that's what will

00:35:37,059 --> 00:35:41,410
have additional details as far as

00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:43,539
ordering any services you may need um

00:35:41,410 --> 00:35:45,450
and then down here is a little bit more

00:35:43,539 --> 00:35:48,130
information about

00:35:45,450 --> 00:35:50,050
details from Freeman particularly you

00:35:48,130 --> 00:35:51,730
want to read the information about

00:35:50,050 --> 00:35:53,980
material handling so if you're shipping

00:35:51,730 --> 00:35:55,660
items to Freeman you need to order

00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:58,120
material handling it essentially is

00:35:55,660 --> 00:36:00,100
there a version of receiving and and

00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:03,160
then transporting things over to your

00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:04,780
booth the one thing you should you don't

00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:07,570
need to order material handling if it's

00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:09,640
something related directly to like a

00:36:07,570 --> 00:36:13,360
module sponsorship so for instance if

00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:15,580
you're shipping a cocktail napkins for

00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:16,960
the opening reception that is a not you

00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:18,190
are not required to fill in the material

00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:22,120
handling for that because we've already

00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:23,740
taken care of that one again there's

00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:26,560
details here for ordering carpet and

00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:28,540
electrical the electrical will be filled

00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:31,750
out within the next week or so and then

00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:33,520
here's information about catering so the

00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:35,590
catering company it's important that you

00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:37,180
reach out to them if you're planning

00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:39,550
with any kind of food or beverage in

00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:40,750
your booth you're more than welcome to

00:36:39,550 --> 00:36:43,690
kind of put whatever you like in your

00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:44,770
booth but I will be really clear that

00:36:43,690 --> 00:36:47,380
you must work with the catering

00:36:44,770 --> 00:36:48,730
department they do have a sample form so

00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:50,560
for instance if you want to provide

00:36:48,730 --> 00:36:53,410
samples of a special amount of chocolate

00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:56,500
from your hometown area you can request

00:36:53,410 --> 00:36:57,520
that exception but generally any food or

00:36:56,500 --> 00:37:01,330
beverage must be ordered through

00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:04,720
catering and again here's the details on

00:37:01,330 --> 00:37:07,000
the lead retrieval system and then here

00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:10,270
is the shipping information section so

00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:12,520
again this is split up by basically what

00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:14,530
type of material it is so for the

00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:15,730
shipping information on the majority of

00:37:14,530 --> 00:37:17,920
what you'll be shipping will be booth

00:37:15,730 --> 00:37:20,920
materials so that's this first section

00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:23,620
and essentially what you need to do is

00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:25,750
follow these shipping instructions by

00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:28,990
putting in your company name and your

00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:30,340
booth number and then using this you can

00:37:28,990 --> 00:37:33,360
essentially just print this off as a

00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:35,740
little label to put on your box and then

00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:38,380
again there's deadlines here as to when

00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:39,820
items must be received so when you're

00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:41,920
shipping things to the show if you're

00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:43,480
shipping it before May fourth it's going

00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:46,030
to this advanced warehouse so if you're

00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:47,140
shipping it after May fourth you'll want

00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:50,050
to make sure that it goes to the right

00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:51,000
to the right location so then again

00:37:50,050 --> 00:37:55,390
here's some shipping information

00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:58,390
regarding individual module sponsorships

00:37:55,390 --> 00:37:59,099
and again you can see that there's a

00:37:58,390 --> 00:38:01,650
little bit of it

00:37:59,099 --> 00:38:03,329
address so don't don't just copy and

00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:04,589
paste the address and think there's

00:38:03,329 --> 00:38:08,249
different deadlines just really pay

00:38:04,589 --> 00:38:10,140
attention to each section and then

00:38:08,249 --> 00:38:12,599
here's information for catering specific

00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:14,220
items so for the catering specific items

00:38:12,599 --> 00:38:15,690
we send those directly to the catering

00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:17,009
department so that they can put them out

00:38:15,690 --> 00:38:20,130
with your event so whether that's

00:38:17,009 --> 00:38:24,059
opening reception or like a cocktail

00:38:20,130 --> 00:38:26,640
hour and we have some guidelines here as

00:38:24,059 --> 00:38:29,039
far as how many what quantity to provide

00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:30,660
if you have any more specific questions

00:38:29,039 --> 00:38:32,779
on quantities or event size you can

00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:34,529
always reach out to Tim and he can help

00:38:32,779 --> 00:38:36,989
he can help answer any of those

00:38:34,529 --> 00:38:38,700
questions and then our last section is

00:38:36,989 --> 00:38:40,440
about the sustainability at triple con

00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:42,059
los angeles and what we do to kind of

00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:47,339
make the event a little bit more

00:38:42,059 --> 00:38:50,130
sustainable ok so that pretty much wraps

00:38:47,339 --> 00:38:52,680
up the event kit and we touched on this

00:38:50,130 --> 00:38:54,989
sponsor prospectus so online

00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:56,849
registration for the event we will

00:38:54,989 --> 00:38:58,589
hopefully have open within a week there

00:38:56,849 --> 00:39:00,660
in the final stages of testing that and

00:38:58,589 --> 00:39:02,460
it's looking really really sharp so

00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:03,989
you'll look stay tuned for that and we

00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:06,390
will be sure and announced that directly

00:39:03,989 --> 00:39:07,799
to you our sponsors we want to make sure

00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:10,259
that you have everything you need in

00:39:07,799 --> 00:39:12,390
order to get in there and see what's

00:39:10,259 --> 00:39:16,319
available and then also use your coupon

00:39:12,390 --> 00:39:18,119
code to sign up your teams and then the

00:39:16,319 --> 00:39:20,309
faz far as the hotels go this is the

00:39:18,119 --> 00:39:22,499
information for Barbara Mulligan she is

00:39:20,309 --> 00:39:24,329
our representative at house Briscoe and

00:39:22,499 --> 00:39:26,309
she has a whole team working with her so

00:39:24,329 --> 00:39:29,519
you can see see Nick and Donette and

00:39:26,309 --> 00:39:32,519
Barbara and her team are excellent

00:39:29,519 --> 00:39:36,269
handling group reservations and it

00:39:32,519 --> 00:39:37,769
really does it doesn't get easier to be

00:39:36,269 --> 00:39:39,900
able to just manage a block directly

00:39:37,769 --> 00:39:41,640
with Barbara she does a great job of

00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:43,680
making sure that she finds the right

00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:45,479
hotel for you and your group and work

00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:47,789
with various budgets and the needs and

00:39:45,479 --> 00:39:49,109
you know if you have certain people that

00:39:47,789 --> 00:39:50,759
need regular rooms and other people need

00:39:49,109 --> 00:39:52,529
sweets you can you can coordinate all of

00:39:50,759 --> 00:39:56,219
that for you so I highly recommend

00:39:52,529 --> 00:39:58,049
reaching out to Barbara ok so the next

00:39:56,219 --> 00:40:00,089
webcast will be in about a month and

00:39:58,049 --> 00:40:01,650
that's again about maximizing your
