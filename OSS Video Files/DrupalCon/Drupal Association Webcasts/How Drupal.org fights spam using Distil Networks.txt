ok we're going to be recording today's

00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:11,550
webinar it will be available to everyone

00:00:08,269 --> 00:00:13,019
after we're done but good morning

00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:15,560
welcome everyone thank you for joining

00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:17,880
us today we're going to talk about

00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:19,859
protecting Drupal sites from spam and

00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:22,410
we're going to do a case study of drupal

00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:23,760
org the drupal association is written

00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:25,800
recently partnered with distilled

00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,960
networks to come up with a modern

00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,029
solution for handling spam on the home

00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:31,800
of the community and we did really

00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:34,290
pleased with the results so we'd like to

00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,700
talk to you today about how we put that

00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:37,590
solution together and how we've worked

00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:39,180
with is still and how some of their

00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:43,950
techniques can be extended to protect

00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:46,050
other Drupal sites in the future so with

00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:48,000
that said let me do some introductions

00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:49,469
my name is Tim Lennon I'm the director

00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,480
of engineering for the drupal

00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:54,030
association and I'll let my co-host

00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:55,559
Edward introduce himself hey on the

00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:57,390
Edward relevance and I had a product

00:00:55,559 --> 00:01:00,539
marketing for distilled networks so

00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:03,690
pleased to be here awesome thank you for

00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:09,510
joining Edward let's go ahead and get

00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:11,130
started so drupal.org faces some

00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:16,080
significant challenges when it comes to

00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:20,700
spam that are culpable to to a high

00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:22,830
value high traffic website that would be

00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:24,930
a significant target for stammers in

00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:26,850
particular those challenges are where a

00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:28,729
page rank 9 site which means that any

00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:30,540
Content that lines up on drupal.org

00:01:28,729 --> 00:01:32,159
immediately hits the top of search

00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:34,439
engines no matter what part of our site

00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:37,320
is posted on and that makes it a really

00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:39,150
valuable target for anyone promoting you

00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:42,630
know SEO spammers link spam things of

00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:46,380
that nature we're also wide open to user

00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:48,060
generated content we have open user

00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:49,890
registration anyone can create an

00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:51,869
account because we're community website

00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:55,740
all of our content is generated by our

00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:57,390
users and this means that we can't just

00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:59,299
lock everything down to keep people from

00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:01,409
coming in and posting spam and

00:01:59,299 --> 00:02:04,049
furthermore because we're a non-profit

00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:05,610
and a volunteer-driven community we

00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:08,310
don't have much capacity for manual

00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:13,520
moderation so we can't rely on human

00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:13,520
power in the spam fight

00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:18,470
so what's the cost of spam and why is

00:02:16,099 --> 00:02:22,099
fighting it so important for a site like

00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:25,269
drupal.org in four flights in general

00:02:22,099 --> 00:02:29,090
for us in particular we have to

00:02:25,269 --> 00:02:32,000
carefully Shepherd the resources of the

00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:34,310
community and so constantly fighting

00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,959
spam results and volunteer burnout when

00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:37,790
volunteers are fighting spam instead of

00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:39,069
making code contribution we're not

00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:42,349
making the best use of the time

00:02:39,069 --> 00:02:44,720
furthermore the noise of spammy content

00:02:42,349 --> 00:02:49,280
can overwhelm the signal of important

00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:52,220
news about the project it also can

00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:55,359
degrade our search presence as most of

00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:57,530
you may know if a search engine finds a

00:02:55,359 --> 00:02:58,879
consistent and overwhelming amount of

00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:01,190
spam on a website they'll start to

00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:02,870
reduce page rank and the be sure your

00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:04,370
presence and search results and that

00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:07,299
kind of degradation could lead to a

00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:09,530
decline in adoption for the project

00:03:07,299 --> 00:03:12,739
besides that there's also just some

00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:14,660
technical challenges and problems the

00:03:12,739 --> 00:03:16,489
high volume of spam account

00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:18,049
registrations and spam content increases

00:03:16,489 --> 00:03:19,700
our database size that we have two

00:03:18,049 --> 00:03:21,470
managers and it pollutes our community

00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:25,040
metrics we can't measure the growth or

00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:27,370
decline of our community if we're if the

00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:31,849
majority of traffic is coming from these

00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:33,380
spam accounts it really it hides the the

00:03:31,849 --> 00:03:37,099
real information about our community and

00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:41,389
all that noise so I'd like to give a

00:03:37,099 --> 00:03:44,180
brief history of drupal.org and how we

00:03:41,389 --> 00:03:45,650
fought spam in the past drupal.org is

00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:47,359
actually the longest running Drupal site

00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:49,489
on the web and one of the most highly

00:03:47,359 --> 00:03:51,260
traffic and so our solutions have the

00:03:49,489 --> 00:03:54,109
ball this Drupal has we've actually been

00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:56,000
online for more than a decade so in the

00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:57,500
early days of spam fighting a couple

00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,239
techniques emerged I think people are

00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:01,940
widely familiar with and I'll talk about

00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:06,620
why these are good techniques but how

00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:10,879
they how they fallen behind in the kind

00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:13,760
of constant arms race against spam so

00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:15,290
these early techniques that appeared

00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:17,539
we're behavior analysis and content

00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:19,310
analysis and as any Drupal site owner

00:04:17,539 --> 00:04:22,969
knows there's kind of two modules that

00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:24,650
where the go-to for Drupal users looking

00:04:22,969 --> 00:04:26,510
to fight spam the first of the honeypot

00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:27,630
module which uses a hidden fields'

00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:30,510
technique where

00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:32,790
bots that are coming to your site to

00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:34,650
promote spam fill in this field that

00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:36,990
humans don't see anything that fills

00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:38,220
that field is discarded it also offers

00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:40,560
some rate limiting features and things

00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:41,970
like that the problem with this module

00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,520
is that as lots of grow more

00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:46,820
sophisticated as humans who program

00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:49,670
these BOTS intervened to target specific

00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:51,990
high-value websites like drupal.org

00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:53,700
humanized can go in identify those

00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:56,910
hidden fields and write the bots to work

00:04:53,700 --> 00:05:00,840
around them similarly content analysis

00:04:56,910 --> 00:05:02,400
techniques are always part of spam

00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:04,550
fighting in the traditional sense text

00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:07,080
analytics to look for standing content

00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:10,740
either outright rejecting certain

00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:12,090
content or accepting it if it seems

00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:14,490
clear or marking it as insurance

00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:16,470
throwing up a CAPTCHA and Mollom is kind

00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:19,170
of a traditional solution that most

00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:22,440
Drupal sites are used to it's a tool we

00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:24,360
still use but we found that it's been

00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:26,430
falling behind the sheer volume of spam

00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:30,080
and that it's in particular not a good

00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:32,910
solution in a multilingual environment

00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:35,400
so while we use both honey pot and malin

00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:38,760
still today it hasn't been sufficient

00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:42,900
really to to meet the needs for for

00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:45,420
protecting our communities home so as I

00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:48,600
said before these are good tools but

00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:50,670
spam fighting is an arms race and the

00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:52,500
people who generate spam have a direct

00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:55,410
financial incentive to keep finding new

00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:58,980
ways and new techniques to beat our

00:05:55,410 --> 00:06:01,460
protections on so let's talk a little

00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:06,330
bit about what modern spam looks like

00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:07,530
modern spam comes sort of in two forms

00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:12,420
and they're closely related to each

00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:16,320
other first you have humans behind

00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:19,770
proxies where real human users are using

00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:22,710
automation tools including thoughts as

00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:26,370
part of their toolkit to identify a

00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:28,470
specific websites to target create mass

00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:30,870
account registrations using proxies each

00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:33,750
time to avoid IP detection then use that

00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:36,030
as the basis for their sin attacks on in

00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:37,530
addition to that you also have bots that

00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:40,380
are growing more and more sophisticated

00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:41,340
in finding new ways to get around the

00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:43,860
more traditional

00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:45,660
actions that are in place against the

00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:50,310
kind of old-fashioned unsophisticated

00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:51,960
box so I'm going to talk about humans

00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:55,590
behind proxies because some of these

00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:58,280
attacks are the kind that have most

00:06:55,590 --> 00:07:00,570
recently had an impact on drupal.org and

00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:01,919
we use distilled solution in an

00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:04,500
interesting way to resolve this problem

00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:06,900
and then after I talk about that I'll

00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:08,400
hand it over to Edward to talk about bad

00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:12,740
bot detection and how to handle these

00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:15,630
more sophisticated kinds of thoughts so

00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:18,180
human spammers again they're still using

00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:22,440
extensive automation tools they have a

00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:23,850
human driven process but they they use a

00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:27,419
variety of different tools like

00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:29,760
automatic proxy changes like automatic

00:07:27,419 --> 00:07:33,120
browser driving tools things like that

00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:34,979
to speed up the process and that

00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,289
extensive use of proxies helps to

00:07:34,979 --> 00:07:40,979
obscure the multiple bad actions they

00:07:37,289 --> 00:07:42,930
take all coming from the same source so

00:07:40,979 --> 00:07:47,190
guess drupal.org the pattern of attack

00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:49,020
is relatively straightforward these

00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:52,139
spammers are building inventory for

00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:54,930
black hat SEO and link span primarily so

00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:58,770
what we see is that what turns out to be

00:07:54,930 --> 00:08:00,780
just a few users a few real human beings

00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:02,880
are creating dozens or hundreds of

00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:04,380
accounts each using proxies to obscure

00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:06,300
their identity and then either

00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:08,820
immediately trying to post and with

00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:11,039
those accounts or holding those accounts

00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:13,440
of sleep or inventory to then activate

00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:18,060
when they are paid by some company to

00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:20,370
provide black hat on link spam so what's

00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:23,099
the solution that we put together with

00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:24,870
distill networks help we've started

00:08:23,099 --> 00:08:26,760
running drupal.org account registration

00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:31,190
process through the distal networks

00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:33,450
cloud CDM distill users their

00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:36,930
proprietary high-def fingerprint

00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:40,800
technique to identify the kinds of users

00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:41,940
that traffic whatever page or whatever

00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,500
part of the words that is being

00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:46,440
protected in our case the registration

00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:48,300
process and so what we can do is we can

00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:51,000
collect this information that's hide a

00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:52,770
fingerprint for these users and then

00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,200
even when these users attempt to change

00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:56,940
proxies and disguise their identity we

00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,470
can actually detect no that's the same

00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:00,570
person and prevent them from making

00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:05,250
these additional dozens hundreds of

00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:11,070
accounts that then become activated as

00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:13,200
spam attacks so that sounds nice in

00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:14,850
principle but how the house it actually

00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,620
worked for us how can we kind of

00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:19,980
demonstrate the results there's a couple

00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:22,170
metrics for success first is the rate of

00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:24,390
unconfirmed users being created on

00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:25,680
troubadour so the concept of a confirmed

00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:29,190
user is unique to the Drupal community

00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:30,870
but essentially what it means is when a

00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:35,340
user account is first created it has

00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:37,230
relatively limited permissions to take

00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:39,420
action within a community website until

00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:41,220
another human user looks at their

00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:43,350
content recognizes yep that's a real

00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:45,090
human being and confirms them but we

00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:47,070
have this cool of unconfirmed users

00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:49,170
which represent all the new users on

00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:51,990
drupal.org but haven't been bashed for

00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:54,090
yet but also all of the accounts that

00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:57,150
may have been created by spammers by

00:09:54,090 --> 00:10:00,000
bots that might be kind of black hat and

00:09:57,150 --> 00:10:01,680
malicious accounts so if we're if we're

00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,910
seeing this techniques be successful

00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,550
then we should see that the rate of

00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:08,400
unconfirmed users being created goes

00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:10,230
down similarly the rate at which we have

00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:12,600
to do manual moderation should also drop

00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:14,400
if this technique is working if we're

00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,780
preventing these dozens or hundreds of

00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:17,330
accounts from being creative than the

00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:21,930
rate at which we have to block accounts

00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:24,180
should go down so let's take a look at

00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:26,870
some of the results

00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:26,870
um I

00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:31,810
said before when we implemented these

00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:33,490
techniques we're looking for that rate

00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:36,280
of unconfirmed users the pool of

00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:40,500
potential spammers to drop so this graph

00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:44,410
shows the weekly rolling average of

00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:48,510
accounts created per day so prior to our

00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:51,430
relationship with distill we were seeing

00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:54,460
approximately 300 accounts created per

00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:59,230
day on average on drupal.org spiking to

00:10:54,460 --> 00:11:02,140
almost 600 in october of 2015 that was

00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:03,760
the signals that we needed to get in

00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:06,460
gear and really do something about this

00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:08,620
problem so you can see on the chart when

00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:11,320
we first enabled the still protection

00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:14,170
there was an immediate drop off account

00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:16,750
registration we actually went to less

00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:20,410
than half of the number of daily account

00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:22,090
registration that were occurring from

00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:23,560
there we found we had to do a little bit

00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:26,470
of tuning because we wanted to make sure

00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:28,570
that some legitimate registrations

00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:32,220
weren't getting blocked so we tuned

00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:34,930
things a little bit and leveled off at a

00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:36,790
little bit over 150 account

00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:39,130
registrations on average per day which

00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:41,620
was just slightly above half of what we

00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:43,570
had before we a magical protection and

00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:47,140
less than a quarter of what I could peak

00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:51,310
that when this attack really really hit

00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:52,840
us hard from there we brought some of

00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:55,600
our findings about using the still

00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:57,040
networks hi def fingerprinting and some

00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:00,940
of the new technologies that they

00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:03,340
developed and enabled a new black

00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:04,960
listing process based on kind of the

00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:07,630
next generation of their high their

00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:09,220
fingerprint which led us blacklist the

00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:11,560
bad actor patterns in an even more

00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:15,970
robust way and so now we're seeing an

00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:20,200
even more significant decline in recent

00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:22,650
months below that 150 account mark and

00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:27,100
actually steadily decreasing on average

00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:28,420
which is a huge win similarly I talked

00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:29,830
about how we wanted to measure this

00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:32,080
through the number of the amount of

00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:33,820
manual moderation that we had to do so

00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:36,400
looking at a similar period of time you

00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:38,500
can see this spike in how many accounts

00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:40,880
we had to block as a rolling average

00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:43,940
everyday and you can also tell from the

00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:46,190
graph which shows you know a peek at 200

00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:48,350
that when we're having a peak of 600

00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:49,850
being created there are more that are

00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:51,440
coming through that are slipping through

00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:52,520
the lines and remaining a sleeper

00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:56,000
accounts because they haven't been

00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:57,590
activated right away so it's even more

00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,240
important because that evidence shows us

00:12:57,590 --> 00:13:00,590
that we were missing some of these

00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:03,290
accounts and we needed to stop on the

00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:04,790
port started so if i zoom in on this

00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:07,580
more recent segments of data which

00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:09,950
represents when we implemented some of

00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:11,360
these techniques you can see that the

00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:13,190
decline in the amount of manual

00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:15,950
moderation that we and the community

00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:19,070
volunteers have had to do is really

00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:21,710
dramatic we get to this point we're at a

00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:23,720
rolling average of five or fewer

00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:27,590
accounts being blocked either by staff

00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:31,220
community members in a given week so

00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:34,370
it's really been a big big improvement

00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:37,490
for us so the results for us have been

00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:40,790
totally dramatic and our solution one of

00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:43,250
the advantages of using the still as our

00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:44,870
partner in this is that it evolved as

00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:47,300
they evolve their own techniques and if

00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:51,650
they recognize the malicious actions and

00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:53,450
update their tools to better detect to

00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:56,660
better detect new spam attacks and this

00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:58,280
ongoing arms race but in addition to

00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:59,930
blocking these bad human actors there's

00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:01,790
still the bad BOTS to address and I'm

00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:04,100
going to hand it over here to Edward to

00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:08,240
talk about bad bot detection and

00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:09,980
mitigation so thanks Tim yeah I think

00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:12,290
it's really interesting that you call it

00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:14,240
an arms race because that's clearly that

00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:16,730
the battle that you know companies are

00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:19,310
on with this sort of you know malicious

00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:21,680
behavior it's you do one thing and said

00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:23,690
they had changed their behavior you do

00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:26,360
another thing to stop them and then they

00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:27,800
change their behavior again so that that

00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:30,860
graph where you're seeing little

00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:33,020
incremental improvements is exactly sort

00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:36,110
of the arms race that happens in this

00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:38,050
sphere so I think one of the things

00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:40,640
that's interesting about the Drupal

00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:43,400
example here that we've seen is that

00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:47,390
it's using our fingerprint in perhaps a

00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:49,820
different way than many other solutions

00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:52,790
users because many other solutions use

00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:54,470
us to clean out sort of bad BOTS or or

00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:56,240
the automated traffic

00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:58,730
that is doing something on their site

00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:01,760
that is not you know not beneficial to

00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:03,260
the business and so you're using the

00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:05,450
fingerprint to actually say ok there's

00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:07,400
humans on here that are doing malicious

00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:09,470
things and we need to identify them and

00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:11,390
use the fingerprint so using the

00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:14,300
technology of distill which which is

00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:16,160
this high def fingerprint is enabling

00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:17,780
that so it's interesting that this is

00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:21,680
the sort of yin to the yang of our

00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:23,960
typical sort of but problem that we see

00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:25,280
so if I just give it a little bit of

00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:26,510
example of that and then I'll talk a bit

00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:28,790
more about the fingerprints so that

00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:31,070
people sort of understand what you're

00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:33,830
taking advantage of hopefully all sort

00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:35,750
of illuminate the picture so from our

00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:37,640
bad BOTS report we do an annual report

00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:40,220
that comes out every year and it came

00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:42,140
out a few weeks ago for this year we see

00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:44,570
that you know almost half forty percent

00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:48,080
of traffic is is some form of bots and

00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:49,790
only 61 percent is actually humans there

00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:51,650
are there are two types of box there a

00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:53,390
box that you actually want on your site

00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:54,950
and that would be your your search

00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:56,870
engines because they enable you to get

00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:58,970
found and so you want them crawling your

00:15:56,870 --> 00:16:01,220
site and scraping you and indexing

00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:03,050
things so you would want those on your

00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:06,260
site so you would allow them so that's

00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:08,240
you know 18 18 point eight percent of

00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:09,830
traffic would be good thoughts but the

00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:12,050
other portion which is you know on the

00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:13,850
twenty percent our bad BOTS and they're

00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:16,370
doing things that you don't want on your

00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:18,170
site typically one could be they could

00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:20,150
be scraping your content scraping your

00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:21,740
prices it could be running vulnerability

00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:23,560
scanners they could be doing what they

00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:26,300
did a Drupal they could be dropping spam

00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:28,100
and I'm sorry using that to sort of gain

00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:30,770
advantage they could be committing

00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:32,510
online fraud you know trying to access

00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:35,030
credit cards running credit card numbers

00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:37,190
trying to card crack it could be you

00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:40,340
know defrauding your ads you know fake

00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:41,720
clicks and making you pay for people

00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:43,520
that aren't actually clicking on it it's

00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:44,870
because it's actually about doing it so

00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:47,390
there's there's a whole plethora of

00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:49,370
things that bad BOTS can be doing and

00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:53,000
its really understanding what your site

00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:55,190
does that's and what your site holes

00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,590
will sort of understand the scale of the

00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:59,450
problem and so Drupal understanding that

00:16:57,590 --> 00:17:01,520
they've got this subsection of humans

00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:03,830
who are you know creating multiple

00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:06,320
accounts and then being identified to

00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:07,850
being able to identify those using the

00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:09,679
hide their fingerprint is this

00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:12,110
process but it's basically looking for

00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:14,240
malicious behavior and then saying how

00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:16,039
do we identify we've now identified this

00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,569
behavior of multiple accounts and then

00:17:16,039 --> 00:17:19,819
using that fingerprints a block and

00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:22,490
prevent them and the interesting thing

00:17:19,819 --> 00:17:24,530
is that the evolving bot landscape is

00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:26,120
what a bad BOTS doing right they have

00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:29,390
some capabilities that you know exactly

00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:31,429
what well Tim was saying is that they

00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:33,320
they were taking IP addresses that you

00:17:31,429 --> 00:17:35,120
know that you know three quarters of

00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:36,260
them can sit there and just quickly do

00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,120
that so if you're going to start

00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:39,470
blocking on IP addresses that they're

00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:40,580
just going to rotate to another one now

00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:43,159
you playing the game of whack-a-mole

00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:45,020
trying to block the next IP address and

00:17:43,159 --> 00:17:47,150
you know and obviously that's a fun game

00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:49,190
if you're a you know if you're dealing

00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:50,570
with protecting a site so you know

00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:53,240
that's something that's obviously not an

00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:57,049
effective technique for handling this

00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:58,370
problem Oh almost 40% of them are trying

00:17:57,049 --> 00:18:00,650
to be evasive they're trying to make

00:17:58,370 --> 00:18:02,960
himself look like a real real user

00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:04,490
behind a real browser and then mimicking

00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,380
human behavior whether it be moving

00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:09,049
their mouse or clicking you know

00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:11,630
delaying for clicks delaying and pause

00:18:09,049 --> 00:18:13,669
in between clicks and half of them can

00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:15,980
actually load JavaScript so again

00:18:13,669 --> 00:18:18,500
they're doing things that sort of what a

00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:20,900
browser can do a normal user behind a

00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:22,490
browser you would expect them to do so

00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:25,760
they're trying to hide in plain sight

00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:27,679
basically and then again sixty percent

00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:29,059
of them are hiding in data centers so if

00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:30,320
you're going to start blocking hold data

00:18:29,059 --> 00:18:32,240
centers you're going to be blocking a

00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:35,600
lot of real users so blocking IP

00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:37,400
addresses or complete data centers is

00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:39,409
obviously a non-starter so you need

00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:41,480
something else that allows you to block

00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:44,450
and that's again where where this high

00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:46,640
def fingerprint comes in and so I just

00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:48,830
want to sort of explain a little bit

00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:50,840
behind what's the advantage of the high

00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:53,120
def fingerprint you know a lot of

00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:55,039
fingerprinting tools you know have the

00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:57,110
IP address they have some sort of header

00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:59,570
and user agent information they might

00:18:57,110 --> 00:19:01,100
even cookie the browser you know and so

00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:03,740
the first three they're on the list I

00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:05,090
think a lot of solutions have some form

00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:07,700
of that and they claim it to be a

00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:10,309
fingerprint because they gone beyond the

00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:12,500
IP address but this still we've we've

00:19:10,309 --> 00:19:15,559
added another two hundred attributes of

00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:18,340
data that makes it far more granular far

00:19:15,559 --> 00:19:21,110
more difficult to see to sort of hide

00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:21,920
amongst those attributes so if you

00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:23,390
change your IP

00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:26,210
address and all those other two hundred

00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:28,760
plus attributes still say the same we

00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:30,440
think we can identify you based on the

00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:32,720
fingerprint not just based on a rotating

00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:34,760
list of IP addresses and we've also

00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,930
added a whole Tampa proofing layer 2 so

00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:39,440
that so people can't be sort of

00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:41,780
manipulating the the fingerprint and

00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:43,190
altering it and stuffing it with with

00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:46,580
different pieces and informational

00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:48,260
values and so this is the fingerprint

00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:49,880
that the Drupal is using they're using

00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:52,070
it so identify the device of humans

00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:53,840
actually logging in creating accounts

00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:56,030
but it can also be used obviously to

00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:59,420
detect bad thoughts or automated threats

00:19:56,030 --> 00:20:00,980
that are hitting your site and so I

00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:02,810
wanted to sort of explain a little bit

00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:05,240
with a sort of real-world example that

00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:07,030
sort of different from what what the

00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:10,520
Drupal example is and recently we found

00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:13,550
a bot that was attacking gift cards and

00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:16,520
it called it gift go spot what it was

00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:18,770
doing was it was going across we found

00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:21,770
it on almost a thousand domains that

00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:25,280
distill protect and it was going across

00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:28,340
and trying to do you know hit the gift

00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:29,720
card check balance process on all of

00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:32,780
these sites whether they be coffee

00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:35,540
merchants or you know department stores

00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:37,910
or online retailers if they had a gift

00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:40,130
card process that process was getting

00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:43,670
hit with people sitting there saying do

00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:45,800
you have this gift card number and if it

00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:48,080
does give me the balance and that way

00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:49,850
they knew whether a gift card number had

00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:52,490
a balance that they could then go and

00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:55,550
use to go and purchase an item or to

00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:59,900
sell on the dark web and so we saw this

00:20:55,550 --> 00:21:01,700
attack start you know on our systems at

00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:05,270
the end of februari and it sort of

00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:07,310
peaked up during March and it was

00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:09,790
interesting if you go to it that we

00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:13,280
found that there were three profiles of

00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:17,870
the gift go spot and it started off as a

00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:20,060
as a Linux with 30 user agents attached

00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:22,700
to it in the profile we had another one

00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:26,270
which had 500 user agents on a Mac

00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:29,420
system we had another 210 user agents on

00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:32,180
a win32 system we saw it across multiple

00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:34,730
sites when we started blocking each of

00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:35,539
them it was amazing to see that the bot

00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:37,509
operated

00:21:35,539 --> 00:21:41,450
changed and suddenly made their profiles

00:21:37,509 --> 00:21:44,210
iPhones or androids and used another

00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:46,070
bunch of user agents so the real cat and

00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:47,960
mouse game that Tim was talking about

00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:50,269
the arms race that's exactly what

00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:51,409
happened these bots are changing their

00:21:50,269 --> 00:21:54,049
position to make themselves look

00:21:51,409 --> 00:21:56,359
different and the fingerprint was still

00:21:54,049 --> 00:21:57,769
identifying them and so when you

00:21:56,359 --> 00:22:00,229
actually looked at some of the numbers

00:21:57,769 --> 00:22:02,739
associated with a typical retailer

00:22:00,229 --> 00:22:06,169
during this attack we were detecting

00:22:02,739 --> 00:22:09,169
6400 device fingerprints per hour on an

00:22:06,169 --> 00:22:11,570
average typical retailer and that's you

00:22:09,169 --> 00:22:14,989
know more user agents as well and you

00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:17,059
know up to 25,000 IP address is detected

00:22:14,989 --> 00:22:19,129
per hour now you know and I know Tim

00:22:17,059 --> 00:22:21,529
likes to block IP addresses but I don't

00:22:19,129 --> 00:22:24,830
even think that he could handle 25,000

00:22:21,529 --> 00:22:26,210
per hour but it's so it's again you need

00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:28,429
something that handled this in an

00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:30,710
automated fashion not something that is

00:22:28,429 --> 00:22:32,960
relying on a human to actually do it and

00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:34,609
intervene and stop trying to manually

00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,799
block these things so I think this sort

00:22:34,609 --> 00:22:38,809
of gives an example of if a bot operator

00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:41,450
suddenly starts attacking you you've now

00:22:38,809 --> 00:22:43,159
got to deal with a significant automated

00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:45,830
problem and you need some automation to

00:22:43,159 --> 00:22:48,109
start it so if we go to the next thing

00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:49,519
with we try to summarize in the bad BOTS

00:22:48,109 --> 00:22:51,320
report so it sort of give you a little

00:22:49,519 --> 00:22:54,799
bit more education about what thoughts

00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:56,779
do and what they go after so we would

00:22:54,799 --> 00:23:00,649
say the four key website attributes that

00:22:56,779 --> 00:23:02,599
are attractive too bad but our first off

00:23:00,649 --> 00:23:04,549
if you have some pricing information or

00:23:02,599 --> 00:23:06,950
some proprietary content you know

00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:09,739
whether you maybe have you know profiles

00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:12,109
of people's work history or whether you

00:23:09,739 --> 00:23:14,229
have profiles of you know products and

00:23:12,109 --> 00:23:17,090
product reviews and product information

00:23:14,229 --> 00:23:20,210
if you have flights or you know or

00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:21,619
hotels if you know listings information

00:23:20,210 --> 00:23:23,570
like that that somebody would want to

00:23:21,619 --> 00:23:25,220
use that is attractive to people so they

00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:27,559
would what they would want to go after

00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:29,509
that and maybe scrape it number two if

00:23:27,559 --> 00:23:31,519
you have a sign up or a login or a

00:23:29,509 --> 00:23:34,639
registration process which is the Drupal

00:23:31,519 --> 00:23:36,950
example here number two you're

00:23:34,639 --> 00:23:39,919
attractive too aware too too bad BOTS

00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:42,409
number three if you have web forms ie

00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:44,179
somebody can submit something and put it

00:23:42,409 --> 00:23:46,609
and they can maybe use and put some

00:23:44,179 --> 00:23:49,490
comments ma'am in there you are again

00:23:46,609 --> 00:23:50,990
another you are attractive to a bad bot

00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:52,460
and the final one is obviously if you

00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:55,090
have a payment process whether it be a

00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:57,290
gift card or whether it be you know

00:23:55,090 --> 00:24:00,110
processing a credit card if you have

00:23:57,290 --> 00:24:02,360
that on it you are liable to be looked

00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:04,670
at by bots and I just want to jump in on

00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:08,000
the web for example because Drupal

00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:10,429
Association recently built out a new web

00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:13,040
form for some of our industry page

00:24:10,429 --> 00:24:15,860
content that had it followed no pattern

00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:18,530
it was no existing form that any any bot

00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:20,720
designer would have seen on drupal.org

00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:22,400
before and nevertheless as soon as we

00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:25,880
deployed it we had spam submissions in

00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:28,190
less than five minutes it's kind of

00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:31,429
incredible how quickly you can become a

00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:32,750
target it is it I mean you know it's all

00:24:31,429 --> 00:24:34,130
to make it right it's you know they're

00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:35,390
looking for these these kinds of things

00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:37,730
and if they find it then they're going

00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:40,040
to go after it so it's you know the next

00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:43,490
slide sort of shows you the likelihood

00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:46,280
of if you have those four attributes for

00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:49,490
example if you have you unique content

00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:52,040
or pricing ninety-seven percent of

00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:55,250
websites that have that they will be

00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:58,270
attacked we see scrapers on them if you

00:24:55,250 --> 00:25:01,370
have a login page or a sign-up page

00:24:58,270 --> 00:25:05,059
ninety-six percent of those sites will

00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:08,000
have bad BOTS on them if you have a form

00:25:05,059 --> 00:25:10,160
that can be filled in a third of all

00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:13,970
sites that have form will have spam bots

00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:16,160
on them and here's the one that's per

00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:20,080
maybe perhaps more interesting if you

00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:23,420
have login pages ninety percent of

00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:25,400
websites will have bad BOTS behind the

00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:27,170
login page that means they've logged in

00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:29,809
they've got through and they're actually

00:25:27,170 --> 00:25:32,090
doing something behind the login page so

00:25:29,809 --> 00:25:33,650
protecting that login page alone is not

00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:36,470
enough so just going through a little

00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:38,179
bit more detail about each one it's

00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:40,010
interesting if you if you if you haven't

00:25:38,179 --> 00:25:41,780
looked at the automated threat space or

00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:44,480
bad BOTS before I would recommend

00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:47,420
looking up the OWASP automated threats

00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:50,870
handbook it itemizes all of the threats

00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:53,840
that are currently being tracked by that

00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:56,090
organization and sort of explains what

00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:58,220
they are and what they do so for this

00:25:56,090 --> 00:25:59,840
first one when you've been scraped and

00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:02,179
they're scraping your pricing or

00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:03,470
something like that the automated threat

00:26:02,179 --> 00:26:05,419
is grating and we

00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:07,159
would be miss to be a very simple but it

00:26:05,419 --> 00:26:10,309
doesn't have significant amount of

00:26:07,159 --> 00:26:12,860
sophistication technically but it seemed

00:26:10,309 --> 00:26:15,470
it's very widely distributed and seemed

00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:18,409
to happen on lots of sites and so what

00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:20,659
does that spot do that but does it

00:26:18,409 --> 00:26:23,510
scrapes for the data it's great for

00:26:20,659 --> 00:26:26,090
prices it's breaks for competitive

00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:27,860
intelligence you know one of the that

00:26:26,090 --> 00:26:29,929
the biggest thing is is that lots of

00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:31,730
travel sites for example would scrape

00:26:29,929 --> 00:26:34,010
prices against each other so that they

00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:36,169
could compete against them and then

00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:39,559
you've got AG regattas who are you know

00:26:36,169 --> 00:26:41,630
aggregating different you know sources

00:26:39,559 --> 00:26:44,000
of information in one spot and those are

00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:45,770
scraping your content and putting it on

00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,740
their site and and and maybe gaining

00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:50,870
benefit from it so what gets scraped it

00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:53,600
is an amazing amount of thing but it's

00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:57,049
not that technically hard to do and so

00:26:53,600 --> 00:27:00,950
if I go to the next slide you know bad

00:26:57,049 --> 00:27:03,289
BOTS love login pages what you see is

00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:05,539
again this is a more sophisticated bot

00:27:03,289 --> 00:27:08,000
and what the threats that you see here

00:27:05,539 --> 00:27:09,890
the OS threats from the automated hand

00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,840
but they call it credential cracking and

00:27:09,890 --> 00:27:13,370
credential stuffing and this is far more

00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:15,710
sophisticated because they're basically

00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:18,260
trying to sort of get into the account

00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:19,640
and so let me show you a little bit

00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:21,980
about how that happens what happens

00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:25,100
there is how credential stuffing works

00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:28,370
so if you hear about a breach in public

00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:30,080
of you know a business has been breached

00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:31,429
and there are you know millions of

00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:34,159
credentials that have now been made

00:27:31,429 --> 00:27:37,370
available what you're liable if you have

00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:40,460
a login page you are liable to have that

00:27:37,370 --> 00:27:43,640
list run against your login page or

00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:45,440
registration page to see if that account

00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:48,230
exists on it because they're going on

00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:50,809
the human premise but many of us use the

00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:54,770
same login and password across multiple

00:27:50,809 --> 00:27:56,990
sites so even though you may change your

00:27:54,770 --> 00:27:58,880
your password on the site that announced

00:27:56,990 --> 00:28:01,370
it was breached if you use that password

00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:03,470
on another site suddenly now a bot

00:28:01,370 --> 00:28:05,750
operator can use that against that other

00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:07,340
site and go around and see yes I see

00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:09,380
that account there I logged in now I

00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:11,480
mean I can change things i can log you

00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:14,000
out i can commit some fraud with it i

00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:15,799
can buy something I can you know and

00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,970
that creates a whole bunch of downstream

00:28:15,799 --> 00:28:18,650
effects for

00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:22,100
the business itself did they got to deal

00:28:18,650 --> 00:28:23,299
with the unlocking a hijacked account or

00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:24,950
they've got to deal with some customer

00:28:23,299 --> 00:28:27,590
services use with some fraud on that

00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:29,600
account so stopping people from getting

00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:31,580
into an account is you know using the

00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:35,929
technique credential stuffing is very

00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:37,909
very very important and so but again

00:28:35,929 --> 00:28:40,460
like I said earlier protecting your

00:28:37,909 --> 00:28:44,299
login page is not enough when we see the

00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:46,100
volume of bad BOTS login requests we

00:28:44,299 --> 00:28:48,590
only see a quarter of them are actually

00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:50,840
login requests three-quarters of them

00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:53,150
are actually request once they're logged

00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:55,789
in so doing something behind or beyond

00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:59,390
the login page and so for a website

00:28:55,789 --> 00:29:01,309
operator or somebody who's running a

00:28:59,390 --> 00:29:03,080
business online it's important to know

00:29:01,309 --> 00:29:05,150
that you must protect those sites those

00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:06,980
pages behind not just the login page

00:29:05,150 --> 00:29:09,289
that's just the entry point not where

00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:15,200
most of the damage happens and so what

00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:16,850
happens behind the login page so what

00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:19,039
you have is a more sophisticated attack

00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:21,320
Ian and the OS threats that most

00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:23,390
applicable here are our carding card

00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:25,669
cracking cashing out this is where the

00:29:23,390 --> 00:29:26,990
fraud is happening behind the login you

00:29:25,669 --> 00:29:29,510
know maybe there's a payment process

00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:32,179
that they can go and attack you know

00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:36,980
it's it's a place where the fraud can

00:29:32,179 --> 00:29:39,820
occur and if you think about it what can

00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:42,890
happen is that there's financial frauds

00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:44,510
there is this spam that can happen

00:29:42,890 --> 00:29:45,980
behind the accounts you know that's what

00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:47,210
was obviously the Drupal example was

00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:49,250
somebody was logging in they were

00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:51,380
logging in as a real user and then using

00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:53,120
and putting spam behind that and so

00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:55,280
that's where the behavior happens

00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:56,780
there's phishing attacks so so if you

00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:59,659
can take over an account you can do a

00:29:56,780 --> 00:30:02,450
whole bunch of things that other users

00:29:59,659 --> 00:30:06,110
you know there are to your advantage if

00:30:02,450 --> 00:30:08,390
you're a bad bot operator now the

00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:10,970
spamming one is one obviously that's

00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:14,330
very dear to Tim's heart and dear to the

00:30:10,970 --> 00:30:17,870
Drupal community so if we were to call

00:30:14,330 --> 00:30:20,240
this or a moderate but in sophistication

00:30:17,870 --> 00:30:22,640
because sometimes it's about that's

00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:24,500
doing it but sometimes in this case for

00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:25,970
Drupal it was humans were opening the

00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:28,549
accounts and then they were they were

00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:29,890
the pasting the spam forms in and using

00:30:28,549 --> 00:30:31,900
it that way

00:30:29,890 --> 00:30:33,610
but it's it's an interesting one that a

00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:36,340
third of sites I'd deal with that

00:30:33,610 --> 00:30:38,820
problem now beyond those four there are

00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:41,590
some sort of automated threats that are

00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:43,240
collateral damage right so the more of

00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:45,280
this kind of behavior whether it be

00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:49,030
somebody attacking your login page or

00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:52,780
scraping your content or trying to you

00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:54,730
know post fake spam content you can you

00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:57,070
can get a lot of this bad bot traffic

00:30:54,730 --> 00:30:58,780
you can get spikes and this spike can

00:30:57,070 --> 00:31:00,960
lead to application denial of service

00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:03,580
now it's not anything that volumetric is

00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:04,960
d dot is going to prevent because it

00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:06,880
doesn't look like that it looks like

00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:08,950
normal requests normal users doing

00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:10,690
things but really it's a bad bot that's

00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:14,560
doing these things against your site and

00:31:10,690 --> 00:31:17,500
so we see a lot of application denial of

00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:19,240
service things happening on a third of

00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:21,070
sites that we sit in front of just

00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:22,540
because of bad but not because of human

00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:24,490
traffic not the spike in the human

00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:28,180
traffic this is just spike from a bad

00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:30,130
bot doing something and so the final bit

00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:32,260
here is the other collateral damage that

00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:34,150
and I you know Tim mentioned it earlier

00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:35,710
was all your web analytics are wrong

00:31:34,150 --> 00:31:38,260
because they can load your other script

00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:39,730
and they can do they can you know these

00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:41,290
bots are sophisticated enough that they

00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:42,820
skew or your analytics so if you're

00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:45,280
using google analytics and you're making

00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:47,800
decisions based on where you place ads

00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:51,070
or you know where you should place bets

00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:52,810
and investments you can realize that

00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:54,340
maybe you know a quarter of your traffic

00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:56,740
twenty percent of your traffic could be

00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:59,200
completely bogus and your metrics and

00:31:56,740 --> 00:32:02,680
your conversion tracking is completely

00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:04,690
wrong and we have a customer of ours

00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:07,270
stubhub and that is one of the things

00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:10,390
that they use distill for was to make

00:32:07,270 --> 00:32:11,680
sure clean out their traffic of you know

00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:13,300
bad bot traffic so that they could

00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:15,880
understand what the conversion rates

00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:17,950
were with more accuracy and once we

00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:19,750
clean the traffic out of bad BOTS that

00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:22,240
were doing things on their side now they

00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:24,460
were better to make they were able to

00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:26,470
make better decisions on where they

00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:31,510
should invest and and the process for

00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:32,830
getting improved to the versions so one

00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:34,420
thing I wanted to do was just sort of

00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:36,670
you know before we close out was just

00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:38,080
sort of give you a quick overview just

00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:41,140
sort of so that you understand

00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:43,779
technically what the distilled product

00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:46,479
does and how it gets you so I

00:32:43,779 --> 00:32:48,309
it takes you through this this chart and

00:32:46,479 --> 00:32:50,710
so from the left as you see the the

00:32:48,309 --> 00:32:52,359
human the bad bot and the good bot

00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:55,090
traffic coming in on the arrows to the

00:32:52,359 --> 00:32:56,649
left it goes into the blue box and the

00:32:55,090 --> 00:32:58,869
blue box its first thing it does is it

00:32:56,649 --> 00:33:00,639
identifies the traffic and says all

00:32:58,869 --> 00:33:03,219
right using the hype their fingerprint

00:33:00,639 --> 00:33:06,249
are you a real user behind a browser or

00:33:03,219 --> 00:33:08,049
are you a bot and what we do is we do a

00:33:06,249 --> 00:33:09,309
bunch of tests and we we fingerprint the

00:33:08,049 --> 00:33:11,229
device and this is where the high-def

00:33:09,309 --> 00:33:13,149
fingerprint comes in and we use a bunch

00:33:11,229 --> 00:33:16,359
of information that 200 attributes that

00:33:13,149 --> 00:33:18,009
we pulled from the device and then we

00:33:16,359 --> 00:33:19,989
sit there and say okay we've got the

00:33:18,009 --> 00:33:21,999
fingerprint now and then we check the

00:33:19,989 --> 00:33:24,759
largest known violators database in the

00:33:21,999 --> 00:33:28,479
industry which is a shared fingerprint a

00:33:24,759 --> 00:33:30,609
device fingerprint database of you know

00:33:28,479 --> 00:33:32,559
for from all of our sites so or you get

00:33:30,609 --> 00:33:34,799
the wisdom of the crowd you know so the

00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:37,809
fingerprints from every other Drupal

00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:39,759
every other distilled deployment are

00:33:37,809 --> 00:33:41,289
shared here in this known violators and

00:33:39,759 --> 00:33:42,999
if we've seen you already we block you

00:33:41,289 --> 00:33:45,519
immediately so you never even get access

00:33:42,999 --> 00:33:47,619
to the web web infrastructure because

00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:49,089
we've already identified it if we

00:33:47,619 --> 00:33:52,029
haven't already identified it and it's a

00:33:49,089 --> 00:33:54,070
new thought coming in then what we do is

00:33:52,029 --> 00:33:56,830
we do we distill the traffic and that's

00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:59,019
that next layer there we do a bunch of

00:33:56,830 --> 00:34:02,049
traps and challenges and those traps can

00:33:59,019 --> 00:34:04,830
be sort of geofencing can be blocking

00:34:02,049 --> 00:34:07,659
certain IP ranges can be rate limiting

00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:10,419
their they can be sort of injecting

00:34:07,659 --> 00:34:11,829
JavaScript tests they can be doing a

00:34:10,419 --> 00:34:13,329
whole bunch of things but then there's

00:34:11,829 --> 00:34:14,799
also a bunch of challenges that we say

00:34:13,329 --> 00:34:18,099
can you prove to me that you're a

00:34:14,799 --> 00:34:19,869
browser that actually works and what

00:34:18,099 --> 00:34:22,720
we're doing is saying you know putting

00:34:19,869 --> 00:34:24,220
puzzles in front of the browser and say

00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:26,589
if you can solve this puzzle you're a

00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:27,700
real browser if you can't we know you're

00:34:26,589 --> 00:34:29,470
not a real browser because the wheel

00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:31,990
browser would be able to do this so

00:34:29,470 --> 00:34:33,639
there are a whole bunch of trap checks

00:34:31,990 --> 00:34:35,710
and challenges their their honeypot

00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:37,869
links that are thrown in there there's

00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:40,059
there's many challenges and what you do

00:34:37,869 --> 00:34:41,889
is if you start to fail those check

00:34:40,059 --> 00:34:43,750
those traps and challenges then we've

00:34:41,889 --> 00:34:45,429
identified you as a bad bot and then you

00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:47,379
don't get any further and all of this is

00:34:45,429 --> 00:34:48,849
obviously happening before you even get

00:34:47,379 --> 00:34:50,679
to the actual infrastructure that's

00:34:48,849 --> 00:34:52,029
being protected so we were sitting in

00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:54,849
front of the site was sitting in line

00:34:52,029 --> 00:34:57,250
and doing this before before you any

00:34:54,849 --> 00:34:57,740
damage can be done and then beyond those

00:34:57,250 --> 00:34:59,660
that

00:34:57,740 --> 00:35:02,000
source request we've got this machine

00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:04,580
learning module where we learn the

00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,500
behavior of you know typical good

00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:08,840
behavior and bad behavior around the

00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:10,880
network around all the sites that we

00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:13,640
protect and we have we have to sort of

00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:15,380
milling machine learning models one is

00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:17,300
the global network what looks normal on

00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:18,980
the global network so you again sort of

00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:21,110
learning from all the other deployments

00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:24,260
and then also what what do we learn from

00:35:21,110 --> 00:35:26,150
your domain specific users so there's a

00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:27,440
typical user does these types of

00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:30,020
behavior and they get cluster together

00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:32,600
anybody outside of that normal cluster

00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:33,619
of use human user they get flagged as

00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:35,210
that maybe there's something that

00:35:33,619 --> 00:35:38,030
there's going wrong there so the machine

00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:40,280
learning is constantly looking at the at

00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:42,320
the traffic and they're sort of

00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:43,850
improving the detection methods and then

00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:45,500
we have the ability to respond that we

00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:49,340
have the ability to spawns using sort of

00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:51,560
universal ackles throwing up captures

00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:53,210
throwing up blocks you know silently

00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:55,250
monitoring there's a whole bunch of

00:35:53,210 --> 00:35:58,550
granular responses that we can do based

00:35:55,250 --> 00:36:00,830
on per page per path that's that's a and

00:35:58,550 --> 00:36:03,470
all of this happens automatically it's

00:36:00,830 --> 00:36:06,350
set and so when it's needing to block

00:36:03,470 --> 00:36:08,960
those 21,000 IP addresses that Tim can't

00:36:06,350 --> 00:36:11,060
manage to do manually the machine will

00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:13,910
do that for you and then the final one

00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:15,320
is we also have an analyst managed

00:36:13,910 --> 00:36:17,270
service that will manage the whole

00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:19,130
program for you so they will you know

00:36:17,270 --> 00:36:21,890
really take care of the problem for you

00:36:19,130 --> 00:36:23,660
and do this sort of arms race a battle

00:36:21,890 --> 00:36:25,460
for you so that you know you can rest

00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:26,980
easy doing the rest of your job rather

00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:29,930
than worry about cleaning your traffic

00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:31,940
this bill can take care of that and the

00:36:29,930 --> 00:36:33,830
analyst managed services that so I just

00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:37,040
want to give you an overview on what the

00:36:33,830 --> 00:36:40,369
product does and how it works so that so

00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:41,540
you get some sort of context and finally

00:36:40,369 --> 00:36:43,850
sort of say if there's more there's a

00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:46,220
lot more data in our bad BOTS report and

00:36:43,850 --> 00:36:49,310
that we recently published so please go

00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:51,800
to distill networks com and download it

00:36:49,310 --> 00:36:53,600
it's full of 40 pages of statistics

00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:57,380
about bad BOTS and what they're doing on

00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:58,940
websites and it really is i think you

00:36:57,380 --> 00:37:00,140
know an interesting read for people who

00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:04,810
are wanting to learn about how this

00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:04,810
website can get abused by bad traffic

00:37:05,470 --> 00:37:11,480
thanks very much Edward I know that at

00:37:09,050 --> 00:37:12,890
the Association sighs we found the tools

00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:15,680
that you provide to be tremendously

00:37:12,890 --> 00:37:17,090
helpful it's really helped to protect

00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:18,740
the volunteer efforts that had

00:37:17,090 --> 00:37:20,630
previously been so absorbed with Stan

00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:22,700
fighting on True Blood organ and let us

00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:24,610
use that effort on for more productive

00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:28,040
needs for contributions to the project

00:37:24,610 --> 00:37:31,370
and that's been really great I wanted to

00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:33,200
invite everyone who's listening live or

00:37:31,370 --> 00:37:36,200
watching this recording to join us at

00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:37,490
drupalcon Baltimore distill networks is

00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:40,460
going to be giving a presentation at

00:37:37,490 --> 00:37:44,210
drupalcon it will be it from 345 to 4 15

00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:45,530
p.m. eastern time on wednesday to 26 so

00:37:44,210 --> 00:37:47,690
i hope you'll be able to join us there

00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:49,460
and learn more sessions are also

00:37:47,690 --> 00:37:51,500
recorded at drupalcon so that should be

00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:54,230
available as well if you're not able to

00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:55,370
attend the con directly and Edward can

00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:57,920
you tell us a little bit more about this

00:37:55,370 --> 00:38:00,740
too still often yeah yeah for anybody

00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:02,480
who's watching this you know we've we've

00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:04,510
got an offer of two three months of

00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:07,220
distilled just to Drupal community users

00:38:04,510 --> 00:38:09,080
and so that that offer is valid until

00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:12,140
the end of the month so if you just go

00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:13,970
to distill networks com and and and sort

00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:16,430
of fill out the contact us page and say

00:38:13,970 --> 00:38:19,310
this is where you saw us and you know

00:38:16,430 --> 00:38:21,110
you heard about us on this webinar will

00:38:19,310 --> 00:38:23,180
be will be happy to one of the two three

00:38:21,110 --> 00:38:26,120
months of distilled for you so hopefully

00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:27,380
that's an incentive to sort of give you

00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:29,390
a chance to sort of help clean your

00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:30,920
traffic and you know we'd be delighted

00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:33,140
to sort of chat with you further about

00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:35,990
what what problems you're you're you're

00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:37,970
dealing with because it you know in the

00:38:35,990 --> 00:38:39,740
community of this we see that there's a

00:38:37,970 --> 00:38:42,110
lot of different use cases where bots

00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:45,680
are doing these sort of malicious things

00:38:42,110 --> 00:38:47,810
and it's sort of it's it's only the you

00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:49,760
know the create creativity of the human

00:38:47,810 --> 00:38:51,230
mind that sort of is the limit here it's

00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:52,340
an amazing thing when you see the

00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:54,320
different things that people are trying

00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:56,150
to do and exploit so if you want to have

00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:57,680
a chat about it please please contact us

00:38:56,150 --> 00:39:01,340
and we'd be more than willing to help

00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:03,080
you out wonderful alright so at this

00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:06,050
time I'd like to open up any questions

00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:08,780
that there may be if you're joining us

00:39:06,050 --> 00:39:11,090
live on a call there is a Q&A button in

00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:13,520
your control bar for the webinar where

00:39:11,090 --> 00:39:15,620
you can ask any questions that you might

00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:16,790
have so feel free to put any questions

00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:21,770
there

00:39:16,790 --> 00:39:25,190
I have a couple to start actually so the

00:39:21,770 --> 00:39:27,170
first one is what if I'm afraid of

00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:28,790
blocking real users and just a false

00:39:27,170 --> 00:39:31,610
positives in general how do you know

00:39:28,790 --> 00:39:33,020
whether you're you're whether you're

00:39:31,610 --> 00:39:34,640
measures you put in place are going to

00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:38,390
keep real users away versus just the

00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:40,970
boss yeah I think that's the that's the

00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:43,490
holy grail for many businesses is that

00:39:40,970 --> 00:39:47,330
they're they're worried so much about

00:39:43,490 --> 00:39:50,540
just converting a user to a customer but

00:39:47,330 --> 00:39:54,230
any manner of false positives is deemed

00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:56,630
to be you know adding cream increasingly

00:39:54,230 --> 00:39:58,610
negative its user experience so it's

00:39:56,630 --> 00:40:01,430
something that they definitely don't

00:39:58,610 --> 00:40:03,680
want to do so when we're sort of talking

00:40:01,430 --> 00:40:06,800
to companies about putting processes in

00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:08,660
place first off we obviously stress the

00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:13,100
importance of the high-def fingerprint

00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:16,940
and identifying the device to we also

00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:19,280
sit there and say there are there are

00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:21,650
monitor modes that we can put things in

00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:23,540
and say cheers and so you can start to

00:40:21,650 --> 00:40:25,700
see what we would detect and what gets

00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:26,810
detected before we actually do it so

00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:29,090
they'll say here's the list of people

00:40:26,810 --> 00:40:31,070
that we would have blocked if you would

00:40:29,090 --> 00:40:33,290
if we wanted it are they real customers

00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:35,150
and so you can sort of learn on the job

00:40:33,290 --> 00:40:36,980
and say okay if that was cleaned out

00:40:35,150 --> 00:40:39,650
would if it affected a real customer and

00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:42,290
many times because companies don't you

00:40:39,650 --> 00:40:44,840
know find that they don't have those you

00:40:42,290 --> 00:40:49,040
know any any false positives in there we

00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:50,810
also have one of the only tools in cyber

00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:52,190
security that actually monitors it's

00:40:50,810 --> 00:40:54,200
false positive rate which is an

00:40:52,190 --> 00:40:56,690
interesting one in that we we have a

00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:59,120
capture solve rate that happens so if we

00:40:56,690 --> 00:41:03,260
if we're unsure and we serve a capture

00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:05,330
to a user and we say okay we've

00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:08,270
identified the spike in traffic we we

00:41:05,330 --> 00:41:11,120
served a bunch of captures out we look

00:41:08,270 --> 00:41:12,980
at actually how many was solved and so

00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:14,300
because I solve rate is if it solves it

00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:17,990
we've obviously got a false positive

00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:20,600
involved so and then we look at what's

00:41:17,990 --> 00:41:22,880
the behavior of that false positive

00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:24,770
report and so we're actually looking at

00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:26,450
our performance in self it's not a black

00:41:24,770 --> 00:41:29,720
box this is a report that you can see

00:41:26,450 --> 00:41:31,130
yourselves how many solved captures

00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:32,960
there were so I'm

00:41:31,130 --> 00:41:35,210
many ways of looking at this problem

00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:37,790
because it you know in the world of

00:41:35,210 --> 00:41:39,680
retail and the world of e-commerce you

00:41:37,790 --> 00:41:41,840
know blocking real users you know is

00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:43,520
real money being stopped and so we

00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:45,320
understand that it's a key part of it

00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:48,050
that is why we put all these steps in

00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:51,200
place including including sort of having

00:41:48,050 --> 00:41:55,280
the ability to audit whether you have

00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:56,960
any resolve captures awesome okay I've

00:41:55,280 --> 00:42:00,890
got one more question here I think

00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:02,360
before we wrap up so what if I'm a site

00:42:00,890 --> 00:42:05,030
owner and I know that I have at least

00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:06,770
one or more of those attributes that you

00:42:05,030 --> 00:42:08,810
listed as things that making targets for

00:42:06,770 --> 00:42:12,470
these bad BOTS how do I know if I'm

00:42:08,810 --> 00:42:14,540
already getting hit by bus you know in

00:42:12,470 --> 00:42:17,150
that I guess the glib response for that

00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:19,640
would be you know from our data we

00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:22,100
pretty much can guarantee it but that

00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:24,800
you are being attacked and the bots are

00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:26,720
on your site how successful they're

00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:28,970
being you probably need to look at sort

00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:30,740
of other things like you know account

00:42:28,970 --> 00:42:32,000
lockout you know are you seeing a lots

00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:33,440
of people who are locked out and they're

00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:36,680
having to look you know get you know

00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:39,170
call customer service again yeah or do

00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:40,940
something to get access back into their

00:42:39,170 --> 00:42:44,360
account are you seeing increases in

00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:47,090
fraud on your site are you seeing

00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:48,920
increases amount of spam or customer

00:42:47,090 --> 00:42:50,630
service complaints about spam are those

00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:52,250
the things that you're hearing about and

00:42:50,630 --> 00:42:54,290
seeing in the business if you start

00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:55,940
hearing about those it's pretty much the

00:42:54,290 --> 00:42:58,220
bots that are probably taking care of

00:42:55,940 --> 00:43:00,440
that for you and doing those things

00:42:58,220 --> 00:43:02,780
against your site so if you're starting

00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:04,900
to see those kinds of behaviors and see

00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:07,640
those kinds of outcomes for customers

00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:09,080
that's probably an indicator then

00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:10,670
obviously you can start to look at your

00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:14,180
logs and start to sort of do some

00:43:10,670 --> 00:43:15,800
investigation and ultimately it's a

00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:18,200
solution that sort of looks at BOTS

00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:20,870
mitigation or automating this to to

00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:22,160
clean your traffic that probably will be

00:43:20,870 --> 00:43:24,410
something that you'd be interested in

00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:27,020
once you've done those kinds of

00:43:24,410 --> 00:43:29,360
evaluations so you know ultimately it's

00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:30,590
you know this is an arms race and you

00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:34,070
need somebody who's going to help you

00:43:30,590 --> 00:43:35,630
defend it because we find that IT teams

00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:37,760
today they don't have the time to sit

00:43:35,630 --> 00:43:40,160
there and and work out and clean their

00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:42,080
their their traffic themselves if they

00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:43,940
can have somebody else an expert do it

00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:44,660
for them that it sort of freeze them up

00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:46,640
to do other thing

00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:48,890
that are more productive to the business

00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:50,329
and they can sort of you know get the

00:43:48,890 --> 00:43:54,410
peace of mind that somebody's taking

00:43:50,329 --> 00:43:56,750
care of it for them awesome okay well

00:43:54,410 --> 00:43:59,119
that's our last question so I want to go

00:43:56,750 --> 00:44:01,280
ahead and I want to thank distill
