00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,990
having some technical issues but I'm

00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:18,930
really glad that we can give you our

00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:19,949
quarterly update on the various things

00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:22,320
that we're doing here at the Drupal

00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:25,769
Association it's always a pleasure to be

00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:29,390
able to let our supporters have a little

00:00:25,769 --> 00:00:32,399
more insight into what we're focusing on

00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:34,530
what we're moving moving forward on your

00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:37,980
behalf as a business at supporting

00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:41,430
Drupal and how we're helping the

00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:43,680
community come together as well so just

00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:45,360
a few things if you can just stay muted

00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,309
during the call that way we don't record

00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,969
everyone typing if you have questions

00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:52,940
you can use the chat window and you know

00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:55,530
you can always tweet anything you hear

00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:58,260
by all means share what you're learning

00:00:55,530 --> 00:01:04,199
and you can use our handle at Drupal

00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:05,939
Association and so if you want to listen

00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:07,470
to this later we are recording it we're

00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:10,799
going to email it to all supporters as

00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:12,450
well today we'll just go over some top

00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,610
news items here at the Drupal

00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:16,799
Association and then Kerry is going to

00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:20,009
talk about some changes to the supporter

00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:21,750
program and then we are going to just

00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:26,640
give some highlights on Drupal con and

00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:28,380
Tim will then talk about drupal.org of

00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,180
course I want to first just thank all of

00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:33,840
our supporters starting with the

00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:37,140
signature supporters and our premium

00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:39,150
supporting partners as well as the

00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:41,579
supporting partners and those are the

00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:44,700
Drupal agencies that are coming together

00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:47,430
to support us but we also have

00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:48,810
technology and hosting companies in

00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:51,810
addition to the ones you saw on a

00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:54,780
signature slide these are the premium

00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:56,310
levels that are supporting the program

00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:57,899
and recognizing that they are also

00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:00,149
benefiting from Drupal and wanting to

00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:03,299
give back and those that are at the

00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:05,100
supporter level and of course all the

00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:07,200
funding goes to improving drupal.org

00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:10,259
which is the home of the project and

00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:13,140
allows us to breathe you're one together

00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:13,610
to build the software and providing the

00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:17,390
tools

00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:19,160
everybody needs as well as doing the

00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:21,530
initial work we started to do which is

00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:23,720
promoting the software some of the

00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:27,650
redesign was done on the homepage as

00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:29,240
well as the the recent industry pages so

00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:32,480
just a little update on some Drupal

00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:34,370
Association news as you may know there's

00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:36,110
been a lot of community discussions over

00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:38,600
the last couple months about how we

00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:41,870
could improve community health and that

00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:46,190
starts with remodeling governance how we

00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:50,330
make decisions buying for the community

00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:52,220
of how we decide how we want to operate

00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:56,450
together and move forward together as a

00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:58,850
community and so we as the Association

00:02:56,450 --> 00:03:01,670
want to support this effort that the

00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:05,360
community launched own but they do need

00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:08,180
some support and so we have hired

00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,890
Whitney Hess to run community

00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:11,390
discussions they are mediated

00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:14,900
discussions that started at DrupalCon

00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:16,940
Baltimore and then they happened

00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:18,470
virtually online at different time so

00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:20,750
people all around the world would have

00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:22,670
the opportunity to join and share their

00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:25,850
thoughts their needs in terms of

00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:28,640
community governance and that has

00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:30,590
concluded and now Whitney is preparing a

00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,180
summary of everything that she's heard

00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:34,340
where there's agreement on how to move

00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:35,480
forward and some proposed next steps

00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:38,959
that she was hearing from the community

00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:41,870
so you'll be hearing from her soon we'll

00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:43,160
put out a blog post but you know some

00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:45,550
really some really great things I think

00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:48,380
you can hear some more in a recent

00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:51,500
podcast that she and I just did with

00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:53,810
Lola but the good thing is that I think

00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:55,580
I heard coming from her was people don't

00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:59,000
feel that community governance needs to

00:03:55,580 --> 00:04:01,010
be thrown out the door that there's a

00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,630
lot of good things we just need to build

00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:06,380
off of what we have today and just

00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:08,780
evolve it so the other bit of news is

00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:11,720
that Drupal con Vienna is happening in

00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:16,580
September and registration has opened as

00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:18,620
well as call for papers so we certainly

00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:20,120
encourage you to participate and get

00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:22,820
involved this is a another great

00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:24,350
community event where we kind of break

00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:25,970
down those international barriers and

00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:26,669
let people come together share ideas and

00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:28,620
learn

00:04:26,669 --> 00:04:32,490
and grow the community so we'll help

00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:33,900
hope you'll participate in that and I'm

00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:36,479
sure there'll be some more news that you

00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:41,219
can just follow by reading our

00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:43,680
newsletters that go out monthly so let

00:04:41,219 --> 00:04:45,330
me hand this over to Carrie and she is

00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,150
going to talk a little bit about the

00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:50,610
supporter program and how we're evolving

00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:53,520
it to create more value for you as a

00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:55,590
business okay

00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:58,699
thanks I'm again so I'm talking about

00:04:55,590 --> 00:05:02,699
some new and improved benefits that we

00:04:58,699 --> 00:05:04,860
brought to the program last month so as

00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:06,569
I'm sure most of you know funding from

00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:08,939
the partner program helps build a

00:05:06,569 --> 00:05:10,949
successful Drupal ecosystem and all

00:05:08,939 --> 00:05:13,289
funding from these partner programs goes

00:05:10,949 --> 00:05:16,110
directly to support tribble at Oregon

00:05:13,289 --> 00:05:19,379
our engineering team so some recent data

00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:21,960
improves include Drupal CI functional

00:05:19,379 --> 00:05:23,759
testing practice application process

00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:26,759
revamp that helps open up drupal

00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:28,740
contribution to a wider audience as well

00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:30,990
as a Drupal 8 or con page revamp that

00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:33,410
helps show valuators why drupal is the

00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:37,199
right choice for them

00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:39,270
looks like so some supporting foreigner

00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:40,620
benefits were going on used because our

00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:43,440
partners weren't seeing the value in

00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:45,030
them now that Drupal 8 is out we want to

00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,710
direct more attention to promoting

00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:49,199
Drupal adoption within our channels

00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:51,540
including drupal.org we want to better

00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:53,729
align our supporter benefits with our

00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:57,479
mission as well as with what supporters

00:05:53,729 --> 00:05:59,610
value the most so we've been talking to

00:05:57,479 --> 00:06:02,310
our supporters to see what they do find

00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:05,340
valuable some things that kept on coming

00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:07,289
up or weeds brand visibility is a little

00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:11,160
thought leadership so these new benefits

00:06:07,289 --> 00:06:14,280
provide this kind of value and they

00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:16,289
include contribution credits for

00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:18,240
signature and premium level supporters

00:06:16,289 --> 00:06:20,520
that includes case study promotion on

00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:24,930
the front page as well as a featured

00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:26,310
role attorneys pose that's great

00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:29,699
Siri if I could just ask a quick

00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:31,500
question in terms of this benefit you

00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:34,350
know having a have any help with it the

00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:36,419
value to that supporters are looking for

00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:38,660
sure if you would scroll to the next

00:06:36,419 --> 00:06:42,090
slide I'd kind of go into some of the

00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:44,070
details so contribution credits is our

00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:45,720
way of acknowledging that there are many

00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:48,270
ways to contribute to the project

00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:50,820
we often say it's time talent and

00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:52,289
treasure so organizations that are

00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:53,970
supporters will get a range of

00:06:52,289 --> 00:06:56,780
contribution credits depending on their

00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:59,310
supporter level and then as you may know

00:06:56,780 --> 00:07:02,250
contributor credits help your ranking

00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:04,500
within the marketplace the credits are

00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:06,000
tied to your or through your supporter

00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,650
badge and your profile so if you're

00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,370
currently a supporter and you have that

00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:14,039
badge you already have these contributes

00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:16,680
associated to your organization on the

00:07:14,039 --> 00:07:18,449
next slide a lot of the new benefits

00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:21,810
include homepage visibility so the

00:07:18,449 --> 00:07:23,910
homepage seems 350,000 visits a month

00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:26,699
that's our highest traffic page on the

00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:27,889
site and 50% of the visitors are new to

00:07:26,699 --> 00:07:31,080
drew blood org

00:07:27,889 --> 00:07:32,849
about Drupal tri Drupal and case studies

00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:34,260
generally see the highest engagement

00:07:32,849 --> 00:07:36,599
rates so we've made certain assumptions

00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:39,180
about the audience there primarily

00:07:36,599 --> 00:07:43,560
technical that evaluators are coming to

00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:45,240
learn more about Drupal so these the

00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:47,040
featured news stories and case studies

00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:49,530
will help turn the home page

00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:52,020
into a Drupal marketing tool and provide

00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:54,150
visibility of needs for supporters so

00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:56,640
along with organic News the home page

00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:58,020
news feed will amplify your content

00:07:56,640 --> 00:08:00,270
that's compelling to the technical

00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:01,260
evaluator and then feature new cities

00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:03,120
we'll just make sure that we've got

00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:05,550
fresh and compelling brand names or

00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:08,360
tuning out on the home page on a more

00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:08,360
regular basis

00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:14,250
benefits that we're eliminating are the

00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:16,860
rent of site banner ABS the Association

00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:18,570
newsletter article and blog post as well

00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:22,050
as the promotion of a pre-recorded

00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:25,020
webcast and the be a newsletter ad I'll

00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:26,580
go into a little bit about the why some

00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:28,680
companies just didn't take advantage of

00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:31,140
the rental side ABS it's really low

00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:33,330
volume in general and the ads are pretty

00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:35,550
deep in the site so it's reaching more

00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:38,550
Drupal developers rather than a their

00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:41,370
target audiences evaluators and same

00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:43,320
with the newsletter and blog post

00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:45,810
it generally reaches other Drupal

00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:48,630
businesses but not necessarily technical

00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:50,220
evaluators and then lastly we're

00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:52,740
eliminating the pre-recorded webinar

00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:54,540
which was just quite frankly pretty

00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:59,220
difficult for people to support and

00:08:54,540 --> 00:09:00,840
produce and then I just want to say a

00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:02,700
quick thank you for your support your

00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:05,010
account manager should have already been

00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:07,470
in touch about these new benefits and if

00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:09,090
you have unused visibility benefits that

00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:10,860
were eliminating you'll have the

00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:12,780
opportunity to keep them until your

00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:14,610
agreement runs out or transition to the

00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:16,890
new benefits so if you have additional

00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:19,440
questions you can reach out to de Lana

00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:22,260
Lang or mark Branstetter for more

00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,970
questions that's great and we're always

00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:26,760
listening to our supporters and what

00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:30,000
their needs are so this is just an

00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:32,460
example of how we've gone through a you

00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,780
know an exercise to get feedback from

00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:35,100
the different supporters to find out how

00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:37,740
way to make this more valuable because

00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:39,720
we really you know it really matters

00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:41,430
that you're contributing to fund

00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:43,770
drupal.org improvements it's so much

00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:46,140
more we need to be doing and can be

00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:49,260
doing and so we want to make sure that

00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:52,440
we you know keep you as a supporter you

00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:54,540
find value in this and and and hopefully

00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:56,100
we'll be attracting even more supporters

00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:58,500
is a lot more companies out there

00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:00,180
benefiting from Drupal and we want them

00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:02,700
to see the value and giving back as well

00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:06,090
and how that ultimately comes back and

00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:07,920
has returns for them so with all that

00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:10,650
said please know that we are listening

00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:12,780
if you have other ideas of how we can

00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:14,460
create value for supporters please let

00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:17,960
us know we're always looking for new

00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:20,010
ideas so thank you and thanks Kari

00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:21,280
so let's just talk a little bit about

00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:23,410
Drupal con

00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:24,820
one of the things we want to do for our

00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:27,310
business community is make sure we're

00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:29,110
creating value through the two channels

00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:31,000
that we manage which is Drupal con as

00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:33,640
well as drupal.org

00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,770
and as it relates to Drupal con we want

00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:38,460
to grow attendance but we also want to

00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:41,050
lean into more that adoption journey

00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:43,180
Drupal con definitely supports our

00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:46,000
contribution journey and helps those

00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:48,070
come together to work on the project we

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,660
have Sprint's and we have core

00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:52,060
conversations from people to talk about

00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:56,560
what to do next with this with the with

00:10:52,060 --> 00:11:00,340
the code but we also want to use this

00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:01,840
event to make sure we're talking to you

00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:03,220
know people that are using Drupal and

00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:04,870
get them to fall back in love with it

00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:07,510
and learn how to do more with the

00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:09,670
software we also want to get evaluators

00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:12,010
and so that they go to the exhibit hall

00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:13,990
and find partners to work with and that

00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:16,330
they also fall in love with Drupal and

00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:19,120
make the the choice to go with the

00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:21,700
software for their organization and so

00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:24,760
we have more work to do to really

00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:28,960
understand the the purchasing process

00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:32,110
basically within the end-user and in who

00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:35,350
we really need to be bringing into the

00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:37,450
event and curating content for it's a

00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:39,310
big effort because we are evolving the

00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:42,070
focus of this event here in Drupal con

00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:43,390
North America but we have definitely

00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:47,470
started taking our steps in that

00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:49,450
direction I think by having the event in

00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:51,130
Baltimore which is on the East Coast for

00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:52,870
the first time in years just really

00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:56,650
helped us get into a whole new audience

00:11:52,870 --> 00:12:00,010
of people pulling from you know Philly

00:11:56,650 --> 00:12:03,070
to DC that are up and down that 95

00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:05,740
corridor it resulted in us having our

00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:09,430
second highest attendance ever for

00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:11,710
Drupal con which was really wonderful I

00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:14,080
think one of the things that I found

00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:16,870
really encouraging was that Drupal

00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:19,570
training kept filling out especially

00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:22,450
mastering Drupal 8 it sold out we

00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:24,220
expanded it it sold out again it's just

00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:27,400
things like that that are shown that

00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:31,420
there's some uptick in in Drupal 8

00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:33,910
adoption and I'm starting to look at how

00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:35,110
we can see Drupal con as a leading

00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:39,070
indicator for

00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:41,560
our Drupal adoption in Drupal health so

00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:44,980
anyhow there's some other things that I

00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:47,410
thought were pretty notable are on

00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:51,279
Monday we offer have industry summits

00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:52,899
and this is one of the ways we're

00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:55,720
leaning into that adoption journey we're

00:12:52,899 --> 00:12:58,019
doing industry specific summit provides

00:12:55,720 --> 00:13:01,149
peer-to-peer networking sharing

00:12:58,019 --> 00:13:03,070
knowledge within that industry through

00:13:01,149 --> 00:13:05,410
case studies and people can talk in a

00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:08,700
safe space about their common pain

00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:11,470
points and how they can address them and

00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:14,890
find its really successful we did it for

00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:17,680
nonprofit and government higher edge and

00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:19,660
medium publishing so we were able to

00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:22,089
expand that it was really successful the

00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:25,420
nonprofit summit 100% of a attendee said

00:13:22,089 --> 00:13:27,550
they were satisfied - very satisfied we

00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:30,339
just know that we are really focusing in

00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:34,029
the right area here a lot of these team

00:13:30,339 --> 00:13:36,459
from industry specific ops birds of a

00:13:34,029 --> 00:13:37,540
feather and then grew into these summit

00:13:36,459 --> 00:13:40,149
so we're looking to see how it could

00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:41,860
nurture other summits in the markets

00:13:40,149 --> 00:13:44,470
that we know are growing for Drupal such

00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:46,660
as healthcare or finance we definitely

00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:48,279
want to see what we can do to start

00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:51,130
growing some interest there as well in

00:13:48,279 --> 00:13:53,560
the conference another thing that's

00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:56,980
really important to baked into the DNA

00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:58,870
of any conference especially tech and

00:13:56,980 --> 00:14:00,600
especially open source conferences is

00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:04,540
diversity

00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:07,570
you know github just put out a survey

00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:09,699
that show that an open source diversity

00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:15,310
is really low what they were showing is

00:14:09,699 --> 00:14:18,310
about 3% of conference attendees are of

00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:20,910
one of the underrepresented groups we

00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:23,649
are very fortunate that Drupal has a

00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:25,800
much more diversity and focus on

00:14:23,649 --> 00:14:30,579
inclusion I'm making I'm very proud of

00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:33,550
and we work with many people in the

00:14:30,579 --> 00:14:35,440
community in the track chairs to kind of

00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:38,920
lean into that even more so for this

00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:41,410
Drupal con and one of the things we did

00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:44,589
was we reached out to underrepresented

00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:46,270
groups and even provided some funding to

00:14:44,589 --> 00:14:48,279
help them you know people that have

00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:51,040
great content to share that

00:14:48,279 --> 00:14:54,190
and help them come to the event to share

00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:56,380
their content and so just you know we

00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:58,300
were able to kind of measure what our

00:14:56,380 --> 00:15:00,940
diversity levels were in terms of

00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:03,160
speakers and attendees so we have a good

00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:07,420
benchmark now that we want to grow grow

00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:09,130
from but I think the numbers really show

00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:10,839
that there their efforts paid off with

00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:13,480
twenty nine percent of the session

00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:14,980
submissions from speakers had

00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:18,190
self-identified as coming from the

00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:19,930
underrepresented groups so something

00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:25,839
we're very proud of and will continue to

00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:28,000
work on we also in terms of you know

00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:30,370
we're still going through all the

00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,800
sessions feedback we usually find out

00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:36,430
what were the top 10 most popular in

00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:39,339
most attended sessions but one that we

00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:41,529
do know is that for those that are

00:15:39,339 --> 00:15:44,200
sponsoring DrupalCon even though it's a

00:15:41,529 --> 00:15:46,570
pee session versus a community selected

00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:49,000
session you're still highly attended and

00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:52,600
actually sadly which is one of our

00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:55,649
supporters and sponsors of the event had

00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:58,779
one of the top 10 highest rated sessions

00:15:55,649 --> 00:16:01,390
and so I think we have been doing a good

00:15:58,779 --> 00:16:04,209
job kind of coaching our business

00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:06,910
community on how to really create

00:16:04,209 --> 00:16:09,520
content that sells at a session in my

00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:11,800
cell I mean we're continue not to sell

00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:15,250
but to execute just to be more specific

00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:17,170
there and then it and also as we were

00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:22,390
talking with our sponsors and looking at

00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:23,980
the survey we're finding that the people

00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:27,399
thought there were more leads coming and

00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:28,839
there's more interest from evaluators so

00:16:27,399 --> 00:16:31,029
we're hearing some good feedback there

00:16:28,839 --> 00:16:33,160
too so it seems that as we're leaning

00:16:31,029 --> 00:16:35,800
into this adoption journey and trying to

00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:37,570
get the right content and and acquire

00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:39,250
the right attendees for businesses that

00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:40,720
you know we're moving in the right

00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:42,430
direction we know we still work to do

00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:46,180
and actually I'll be flying out to

00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:48,279
Portland tomorrow know today a few hours

00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:50,410
if you don't meet with the team that we

00:16:48,279 --> 00:16:55,839
can think about how we can do even more

00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:58,420
to unleash our marketing abilities to to

00:16:55,839 --> 00:17:01,120
attract in more attendees at DrupalCon

00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:02,920
so just want to let you know some

00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,079
ways that we're investing in this

00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:08,350
conference in keeping keeping you and

00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:10,870
your business in mind another thing that

00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:13,209
we announced at to pecans Baltimore's

00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:14,829
that we have a new brand and for anyone

00:17:13,209 --> 00:17:16,329
who didn't get to hear that message I

00:17:14,829 --> 00:17:19,480
just wanted to share it with you in the

00:17:16,329 --> 00:17:22,660
past every DrupalCon had its own brand

00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:25,480
and you can see the nice assortment here

00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:29,020
they're beautiful but at the end of the

00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:32,070
day as we're trying to promote Drupal

00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:34,929
and Drupal con beyond the Drupal sphere

00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:37,900
we need to have a brand identity that

00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:43,090
really resonates and is consistent and

00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:44,650
so we went through an effort to find an

00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:47,500
agency that would work with us on

00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:49,420
creating a consistent brand and in the

00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:52,540
end this is through the whole process

00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:57,600
what was created and it is designed to

00:17:52,540 --> 00:18:01,960
represent that Drupal is both a blend of

00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:04,330
a human element as well as the

00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:06,820
technology element and they come

00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:11,160
together and Drupal con to create this

00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:14,280
amazing environment of learning and

00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:16,120
building upon each other's knowledge and

00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:20,020
kind of coming together as a community

00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:24,600
as well and so we're excited to be able

00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:27,670
to show this new brand identity

00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:29,620
starting with Drupal con Nashville as

00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:31,210
you know sponsorships have already

00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:33,160
launched but you might have seen some of

00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:36,490
the graphics there with a splash pages

00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:39,520
out there but the whole idea is that we

00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:41,140
will be promoting Drupal con first not

00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:43,630
the city which is what we were doing

00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:45,610
before but we'll still have images that

00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:48,429
highlight the city that we're in and

00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:50,920
we'll still be doing special iconic

00:18:48,429 --> 00:18:52,450
branding that captures the spirit of the

00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:53,980
city that we're going into so you can

00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:56,890
see what was done with Nashville in the

00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:58,690
guitar so there's still a lot of fun and

00:18:56,890 --> 00:19:01,150
play that we can have with the branding

00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:02,470
but at the end of the day what we're

00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:05,080
really trying to achieve is that

00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:07,150
consistent brand it resonates beyond the

00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:09,429
Drupal walls because ultimately we are

00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:12,040
trying to reach beyond our own community

00:19:09,429 --> 00:19:14,170
to invite people to come in the other

00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:14,960
thing too is that this just saves us a

00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:17,690
ton of

00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:21,370
and even allows us to shift our

00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:24,200
resources to do more for the community

00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:27,950
rather than reinventing and re skinning

00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:32,919
our sites every DrupalCon with some

00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:36,289
formal some other benefits going on - so

00:19:32,919 --> 00:19:38,179
let me shift this over to Jim now who

00:19:36,289 --> 00:19:40,070
can tell you a little bit more that's

00:19:38,179 --> 00:19:42,760
happening in our other channel which is

00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:42,760
drupal.org

00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,130
yeah I'm beaver

00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:49,870
happy to so there's quite a lot that's

00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:52,270
happened over the course of well since

00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:53,890
our last quarterly update and the first

00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:57,039
topic you might have heard about if you

00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:59,799
attended Baltimore but I'll reiterate it

00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:02,080
here it's a really really big change for

00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:05,559
the community so just to give some

00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:11,919
background history for pretty much the

00:20:05,559 --> 00:20:13,870
entire history of the project the to in

00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:15,760
order to contribute a new module or a

00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:18,190
new theme to triplet org you first had

00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:20,529
to go through project application

00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:22,450
process and back in the day this was for

00:20:20,529 --> 00:20:24,190
historical reasons about how we managed

00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:27,730
how the code got into the repositories

00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:30,399
but it's become a kind of legacy burden

00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:31,899
on new contribution and speaking with a

00:20:30,399 --> 00:20:35,890
number of supporters whether they're

00:20:31,899 --> 00:20:37,809
shops or Technology supporters who you

00:20:35,890 --> 00:20:39,429
know may have their own tools that they

00:20:37,809 --> 00:20:43,029
want to integrate with Drupal it's been

00:20:39,429 --> 00:20:44,860
a big barrier to people to be able to

00:20:43,029 --> 00:20:46,659
say hey you know I'm building the site

00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:49,390
for a client we need to integrate this

00:20:46,659 --> 00:20:51,340
awesome new service that's out there but

00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:53,649
I can't contribute that back or I can't

00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:55,210
do it in an easy way so what we've done

00:20:53,649 --> 00:20:57,970
is completely open to the project

00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:59,860
application gate process you can now

00:20:57,970 --> 00:21:01,480
create full projects on drupal.org

00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:05,260
without having to go through a manual

00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:07,149
review and instead of that we are now

00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:09,940
putting new signals about project

00:21:07,149 --> 00:21:12,130
quality on the pages to try and make

00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:13,840
sure that we still give evaluators that

00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:15,940
all of the information they need to know

00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:18,549
which projects are right for their

00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:23,320
Drupal sites so if you events the next

00:21:18,549 --> 00:21:24,789
slide so one of the sets of signals it

00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:26,230
relates to security coverage because

00:21:24,789 --> 00:21:28,120
this is one of the biggest concerns we

00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:30,090
heard when working with the community to

00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:32,140
figure out how to make this change

00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:35,980
previously the way that you knew that a

00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:37,330
module had received security advisories

00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:40,299
in the event of a disclosed

00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:42,399
vulnerability was if it had a stable

00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:44,110
release and a full project on drupal.org

00:21:42,399 --> 00:21:45,340
and I was pretty much the only way to

00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:47,500
know and it was kind of insider

00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:49,570
knowledge to make this something that's

00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:51,549
more useful to the community at large we

00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:54,100
put we're now putting signals directly

00:21:51,549 --> 00:21:57,399
on the projects so you will see these

00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:59,860
shield icons and indications of which

00:21:57,399 --> 00:22:01,690
projects will get security advisory

00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:03,100
coverage from the security team and just

00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:04,390
as a reminder that doesn't mean they're

00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:06,160
going through and trying to make these

00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:09,490
module secure it's just a responsible

00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:11,530
disclosure policy if any security issues

00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:13,360
were discovered and that'll help our

00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:16,120
evaluators understand which modules to

00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:18,580
use if you go to the next slide

00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:21,940
this is what some of the signals look

00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:23,410
like if you if a project is not yet

00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:25,650
covered so we have to provide that

00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:27,520
information to have to let people

00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:31,059
incorporate that as part of their

00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:32,470
decision-making process again when

00:22:31,059 --> 00:22:35,080
evaluating modules and this is what

00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:37,450
you'll see by default now the security

00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:39,280
coverage process that is still something

00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:40,780
of an opt-in so if you want to be able

00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:42,760
to get those green badges and shield

00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:44,470
icon there's a process for that that you

00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:48,730
can look at when you're going through

00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:53,169
your project submissions and then

00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:54,880
finally let's see here oh yeah this is

00:22:53,169 --> 00:22:56,200
this is what that process looks like so

00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:58,750
you get this opt-in option on the

00:22:56,200 --> 00:23:00,370
project pages and you get warnings but

00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:02,290
when you're making releases to say hey

00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:04,120
maybe you want to have security advisory

00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:06,730
coverage before you release the full

00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:08,799
version of your module and then if we

00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:10,150
continue to the next slide the other

00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:11,919
thing that we're doing around project

00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:14,350
quality signals is that we're working on

00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:17,710
ways to not just provide security

00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:19,630
signals but provide signals about why

00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:21,100
you might want to use a particular

00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:22,720
module for other reasons so the most

00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:26,200
basic one that's already out there is

00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:27,880
just starred modules so you can see as

00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:29,260
someone who's trying to discover modules

00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:31,240
can now actually see which ones are the

00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:32,460
most popular which is a great signal

00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:35,200
most widely-used

00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:38,590
we already have information about how

00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:40,240
much usage the various modules have and

00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:41,860
we weight those into search so you can

00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,450
get the most popular most widely used

00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:45,340
modules and be looking at those when

00:23:43,450 --> 00:23:46,720
you're looking for something to use and

00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:49,090
then we're looking at adding additional

00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:51,400
signals related to code quality based on

00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:53,590
some automatic tooling that comes with

00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:56,230
Drupal CI that we could then expose on

00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:58,240
project pages to say you know this is

00:23:56,230 --> 00:24:01,690
fully following coding standards dishes

00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:04,450
this has got all the polish and shine to

00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:05,980
be used in a production environment so

00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:07,660
that's what we're doing or that's what

00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:08,950
we did with the project application

00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:10,600
process and we're still doing a little

00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:12,840
follow-up work here and there but I

00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:16,980
think it's one of the biggest changes

00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:18,360
for drupal.org in really years and one

00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:22,830
of the biggest changes for the project

00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:25,169
that will really open up contribution so

00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:26,669
if we continue to the next topic I'd

00:24:25,169 --> 00:24:28,529
also like to talk about the developer

00:24:26,669 --> 00:24:31,399
tools evaluation which is a big kind of

00:24:28,529 --> 00:24:33,360
long term initiative for the project and

00:24:31,399 --> 00:24:34,740
again I talked about this a little bit

00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:36,509
of Baltimore and so you can get a little

00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:40,499
more detail if you go and look up our

00:24:36,509 --> 00:24:44,249
detail panel in the Baltimore sessions

00:24:40,499 --> 00:24:46,950
but basically we're evaluating whether

00:24:44,249 --> 00:24:49,080
to continue down the road of custom

00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:52,200
building our contribution tools using

00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:54,809
Drupal on drupal.org or finding ways to

00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:56,850
integrate with major open source tooling

00:24:54,809 --> 00:24:58,350
providers like git lab or github and

00:24:56,850 --> 00:25:00,149
you've seen a series of blog posts

00:24:58,350 --> 00:25:01,799
opposed to Drupal at or about this

00:25:00,149 --> 00:25:02,909
process but let me just give you an

00:25:01,799 --> 00:25:04,519
update about where we are in the

00:25:02,909 --> 00:25:09,360
evaluation so if you go to the next

00:25:04,519 --> 00:25:11,159
slide the process started with an

00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:15,299
initial evaluation and then a deep dive

00:25:11,159 --> 00:25:17,399
with the staff with the Technical

00:25:15,299 --> 00:25:22,230
Advisory Committee which is a group of

00:25:17,399 --> 00:25:23,820
advisors consisting of you know a couple

00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:27,240
community members and one member of the

00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:28,860
board and then we made some initial

00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:30,389
recommendations at the board level about

00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:33,119
what we thought we should pursue further

00:25:30,389 --> 00:25:34,619
and we communicated out this short list

00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:37,080
that that was those three options of

00:25:34,619 --> 00:25:38,789
Drupal adored github widget lab that you

00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:40,320
saw in the previous slide and there's a

00:25:38,789 --> 00:25:42,240
blog post about some of our initial

00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:43,799
evaluation there and now we're moving

00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:45,809
into this phase of trying to prototype

00:25:43,799 --> 00:25:50,009
what the different options could look

00:25:45,809 --> 00:25:51,809
like doing sort of alpha work to see

00:25:50,009 --> 00:25:54,450
what those integrations are and look out

00:25:51,809 --> 00:25:56,009
for gotchas or look out for workflow

00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:59,399
issues so that we can kind of preserve

00:25:56,009 --> 00:26:00,869
that those positive and unique elements

00:25:59,399 --> 00:26:03,389
of the Drupal work for a while still

00:26:00,869 --> 00:26:05,009
modernizing the tooling so that's the

00:26:03,389 --> 00:26:06,600
phase we're in right now and continuing

00:26:05,009 --> 00:26:10,499
to work on that and there'll be more

00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:12,690
updates either in blog form or as part

00:26:10,499 --> 00:26:17,820
of these updates or at the next Ripple

00:26:12,690 --> 00:26:21,660
con as time goes on let's see here and

00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:23,340
if we continue so

00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:24,780
yeah the next steps like I said we're

00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:26,310
going to learn by doing we're exploring

00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:27,900
a prototype we want to see if we can

00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:32,040
pilot these tools probably with an

00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:33,690
initial contribu want to have this in a

00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:36,060
place where the community can actually

00:26:33,690 --> 00:26:37,740
like use these things a little bit and

00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:40,790
help us do some kind of final data

00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:43,080
analysis help us see what we missed so

00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:46,200
and then I have one more topic for today

00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:49,470
that I'd love to update everybody on if

00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:51,150
you go to the next slide so this is my

00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:53,220
favorite gift on the entire internet I

00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:55,950
use it to represent the drupal.org

00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:57,660
infrastructure um it's quite the Rube

00:26:55,950 --> 00:27:00,620
Goldberg machine of Rube Goldberg

00:26:57,660 --> 00:27:06,510
machine of moving parts and pieces and

00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:08,310
we put out in March a RFP for to find a

00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:09,870
vendor to help us manage infrastructure

00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:11,520
services so that our internal

00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:13,290
engineering team can focus on feature

00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:15,210
development primarily and not so much on

00:27:13,290 --> 00:27:18,690
maintenance and provisioning of machines

00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:20,490
so if you go to the next slide these

00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:22,230
next two slides because it's too long to

00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:24,000
fit on one page it's kind of a diagram

00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:27,450
of what the existing structure looks

00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:29,850
like so you can see that from end user

00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:31,620
back to the back to the basic

00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:34,110
infrastructure we go through our fast

00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:36,930
food CDN layer we then have a series of

00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:38,280
VM hosts where we run instances that

00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:40,770
provide all of the different services

00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:43,200
for triple org whether that's our get

00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:45,570
services solar for search our

00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,890
development environments all sorts of

00:27:45,570 --> 00:27:49,350
things like that you could go to the

00:27:46,890 --> 00:27:51,900
next slide you can see where we keep

00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:57,120
some bare metal servers for the like

00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:59,520
really the services that we have need

00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:02,100
truly high performance like our database

00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:04,680
service and some of our media serving

00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:06,420
and then we also have a portion of our

00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:09,510
infrastructure that happens in the cloud

00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:11,790
primarily Drupal CI dynamically scaling

00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:13,170
AWS spot instances so this is kind of

00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:15,390
the scope of everything that we're

00:28:13,170 --> 00:28:17,280
trying to manage and really find someone

00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:18,980
to help us manage so that we can focus

00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:21,750
on features and not just on this

00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:22,610
architecture so if you go to the next

00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:25,560
slide

00:28:22,610 --> 00:28:27,360
so the by finding this partner it'll

00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:29,790
help us internally keep focused on the

00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:33,330
mission so if we're successful we get to

00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:34,590
focus on feature development on on the

00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:36,779
sites themselves and

00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:38,220
services that directly serve the mission

00:28:36,779 --> 00:28:39,960
of the Association on project

00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:42,679
improvement and then the partner can

00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:45,270
manage underlying infrastructure for us

00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:46,860
so to talk about where we are in the

00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:49,679
process on the next slide I've laid out

00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:51,900
something of the timeline but basically

00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:54,000
we started post with posting an RFI to

00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:55,260
see who might be interested we received

00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,350
all those letters of interest by the

00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:59,789
24th of March and have actually quite a

00:28:58,350 --> 00:29:01,440
lot of interest in potential

00:28:59,789 --> 00:29:04,230
participation in the program and sent

00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:07,559
out the full RFP those proposals were

00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:09,390
due towards the end of April and since

00:29:07,559 --> 00:29:10,799
once we received all the proposals we've

00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:12,270
been reviewing them internally and

00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:14,610
scheduling interviews of leading vendors

00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:16,860
and we are now and kind of the

00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:19,649
homestretch to make a decision so you

00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:21,000
can look out for more information about

00:29:19,649 --> 00:29:22,649
that in the coming weeks when we

00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,260
announce the decision and how we're

00:29:22,649 --> 00:29:28,740
moving forward but we're really excited

00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:30,990
about it as a way to help refocus our

00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:34,490
own limited resources on that core

00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:34,490
mission work that we really want to do

00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:43,140
great last I'm work happening so thank

00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:46,850
you for that overview I just want to see

00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:50,130
are there any questions from the group

00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:52,529
just stop sharing and if you have

00:29:50,130 --> 00:29:54,510
questions you can use either the chat or

00:29:52,529 --> 00:29:59,730
the Q&A function in the tool bar at the

00:29:54,510 --> 00:30:03,120
bottom of the window alright I see we

00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:05,010
have some comments already in here yeah

00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:09,179
one existing question was just whether

00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:10,559
or not would the existing concise change

00:30:09,179 --> 00:30:12,539
to the new branding model all the

00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:14,309
existing sites will retain their their

00:30:12,539 --> 00:30:15,899
their current designs it'll only be

00:30:14,309 --> 00:30:21,419
moving forward that what can you grant

00:30:15,899 --> 00:30:26,940
us implemented all right well there's no

00:30:21,419 --> 00:30:29,159
