Publication date: 2014-08-06
Playlist: Drupal Association Webcasts
Description: 
	Using Drupal as a platform for fundraising and advocacy usually means having to integrate with several third-party systems. Beyond the expense, this creates situations that make it hard to get a complete picture of your constituency.

over to Mike I just want to do a little

00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:40,170
housekeeping so that you know how it

00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:42,030
will go today so the first thing is if

00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:45,000
you're listening from your computer

00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:48,690
please select the mic and speaker audio

00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:52,079
option and please wear a headset it can

00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:55,199
be a lot of feedback if folks aren't

00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:57,600
wearing headsets please remain muted

00:00:55,199 --> 00:01:00,809
during the call and if you have a

00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:04,290
question we have that handy dandy little

00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:07,380
Q&A window so feel free to drop a

00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:09,780
question in there what we'll probably do

00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:11,820
is hold questions until the end but if

00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:15,240
you ask something that's pertinent to

00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:17,729
what Michael is speaking about I'll

00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:20,390
interrupt him and ask the question so

00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:22,650
feel free to use that and we also

00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:24,390
encourage you and would love it if you

00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:26,360

um here today we're going to talk a

00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:17,700
little bit about able organiser the

00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:20,130
organiser is an open source community

00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:23,070
engagement platform ah which drilling is

00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:25,660
released it's free I you know to

00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:28,090
download it's an install profile that

00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:31,120
you can set up on on your local computer

00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:33,580
but what I really hope to accomplish

00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,740
today as we we talk through some of this

00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:38,170
is you know first off I I do want to

00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:40,240
show off this new distribution okay I

00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:44,290
talk through some of the features and

00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:45,280
and look at how the system works and why

00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:48,670
it might be valuable to your

00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:51,790
organization secondly i do want to make

00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:54,280
a make it count um to persuade everyone

00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:56,620
here that there's still a few new ways

00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:59,710
to think bedroom ball and what you can

00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:03,250
do with it um we all have this kind of

00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:04,930
notion about what Drupal is everybody

00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:07,630
comes with question from sort of

00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:10,720
different angles uh what really i'm i'm

00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:14,590
hoping to do is to you know maybe push

00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:16,360
that dial over a degree or two and you

00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:19,180
know just sort of bring people's

00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:20,380
awareness up around what what some of

00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:23,200
the tools are that are out there and

00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:25,810
what some of the things are that you can

00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:31,390
you can accomplish going to the next

00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:33,550
slide so um to start off with i get a

00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:35,740
lot of questions about we're able

00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:38,950
organizer came from why it was built i

00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:42,250
wanted to take a couple of minutes just

00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:45,100
start with backgrounds okay um the very

00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:46,540
first thing to understand is that one of

00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:48,940
the essential components they have

00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:51,790
organizer is a tool called siren core

00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:55,720
it's a set of modules Trell and started

00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:58,660
work on back in 2011 what we were

00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:02,080
looking to do is have a really robust

00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:05,290
yet lightweight on set of modules for

00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:07,780
capturing contact information within

00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:09,970
drupal what we did was we built the set

00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:12,340
of tools that that really just captures

00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:16,690
contacts activities and relationships

00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:18,970
and does absolutely nothing else ok it's

00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:22,030
meant to be bug free and just you know

00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:26,790
sort of a framework that you can build

00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:26,790
other tools around next slide please um

00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:32,650
part of the reason also that we did this

00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:34,120
is really just that we were all bought

00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:37,660
into the idea you know least your

00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:39,070
trilling of Drupal 7 as something that

00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:41,980
could be used is more than

00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:44,380
content management system uh with Exies

00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:46,780
the NCAP I all these other tools that

00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:49,360
were new and emerging what we really

00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:55,270
want it to do is kind of evaluate the

00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:57,820
system you explore some areas for trying

00:06:55,270 --> 00:07:01,260
to use it in new and unique and

00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:06,250
interesting ways we go to the next slide

00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:09,220
um to give you a sense after three years

00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:11,020
of investment and coding and pilot

00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:13,810
projects and very late nights supporting

00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:15,370
random people in the internet on we've

00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:17,620
finally got to the point where we have

00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:20,920
the stable and kind of mature platform

00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:24,160
for contact management um growth I would

00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:27,880
not say has been fast okay um as the

00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:31,020
other day uh I just monday we had 487

00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:34,080
installs of serum court um going on

00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:37,630
Trella and maybe could claim credit for

00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:38,740
50 or 60 of those ourselves okay so that

00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:42,340
this is being used by other

00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:44,110
organizations um that figure of 487 I

00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:48,730
think is is actually kind of interesting

00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:51,580
because when you think about what a CRM

00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:53,650
system is the role that it plays in the

00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:56,110
life of an organization I think that I

00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:57,790
487 figure is actually kind of kind of

00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:59,710
big you know considering Drupal is

00:07:57,790 --> 00:08:02,230
usually used as a contact management

00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:05,320
system or sorry a content management

00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:07,270
system not for managing contacts and CRM

00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:10,480
can be kind of vital to life and health

00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:13,150
of an organization that that's actually

00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:15,160
kind of an impressive figure you know at

00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:16,930
least in terms of of getting people to

00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:20,650
think about technology differently and

00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:25,870
use it in some of your ways sepa go to

00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:29,290
the next slide okay really the big idea

00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:32,440
with CRM core was not just to have mod

00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:34,419
set of modules that can manage contacts

00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:38,229
and activities and relationships really

00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:41,590
what the idea was is that it can act as

00:08:38,229 --> 00:08:43,960
platform okay what we wanted to

00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:45,850
accomplish is to have this nice set of

00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:49,360
tools for managing contacts and

00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:51,700
relationships bad activities but we also

00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,840
wanted to make sure that you could build

00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:55,600
small and useful

00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:58,240
applications on top of it on that extend

00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:00,670
what you're able to do with with the

00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:03,010
platform and just kind of you know new

00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:07,270
and interesting ways what we also wanted

00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:11,100
to do is make sure that the way that you

00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:13,600
built these tools was portable um that

00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:16,450
anything that's being built to extend

00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:19,150
serum core really could be shared with

00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:20,770
the community people could you know

00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:24,280
constantly contribute to it could

00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:26,980
innovate on top of it um the real goal

00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:32,050
for us was to kind of get there so how

00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:34,120
about we hear the next leg mm okay some

00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:37,180
of the problems that crm core

00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:39,580
specifically um can solve and you know

00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:41,590
by kind of thinking of it as platform um

00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:44,980
some of the problems we looking impact

00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:48,730
our layout here on this slide um you

00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:51,640
know from you know i'd say probably the

00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:53,260
most important one is costs there's a

00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:57,040
lot of organizations who could really

00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:58,720
benefit from having some data around who

00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:02,170
is getting in touch with them how often

00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:04,360
they are servicing people what kind of

00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:07,750
communications or you know going in and

00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:09,910
out um at the same time the tools that

00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:11,050
are available that could really kind of

00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:13,420
deliver some of this practical

00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:15,190
intelligence or are just out of reach

00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:17,650
some of the organizations would really

00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:20,020
really benefit um I'm especially

00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:22,060
thinking about like small nonprofits

00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:24,940
maybe with an operating budget between

00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:28,000
three and five million um I'm thinking

00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:29,530
about you know NGOs where you know maybe

00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,770
you're a division within a larger

00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:35,710
organization um data-driven practices

00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:38,760
could be key to you know really keeping

00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:42,160
your grants going and other things so um

00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:43,900
part of why we built serum poor part of

00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:46,660
what referring to hit with CRM quarries

00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:49,120
I just have a solution that could you

00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:54,490
know it's simple than so flexible easy

00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:56,920
to use and um really can be delivered at

00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:59,170
a low price point the second thing is

00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:01,630
ease of use um one of the major

00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:03,670
challenges that organizations run into

00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:06,579
when they've integrated with a

00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:08,860
third-party crm system is the fact that

00:11:06,579 --> 00:11:11,259
you know pages for accepting donations

00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:14,290
or registering for events might be

00:11:11,259 --> 00:11:16,420
hosted on a third party website okay the

00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:18,429
forms that they're using to ask for

00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:22,179
information or static you can't really

00:11:18,429 --> 00:11:24,850
change them um another issue we hear a

00:11:22,179 --> 00:11:27,279
lot about is the inability to access

00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:30,970
metrics around performance um your

00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:33,790
actual reports are kind of only given to

00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:35,949
a small number of users um with

00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:37,899
privileges in your organization of the

00:11:35,949 --> 00:11:41,949
people who actually run campaigns might

00:11:37,899 --> 00:11:43,179
not have an access to that data um in in

00:11:41,949 --> 00:11:44,769
essence you know when you're running

00:11:43,179 --> 00:11:46,720
campaigns you don't want to be rent

00:11:44,769 --> 00:11:49,449
blind you would understand who's coming

00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:51,910
to your site who's actually engaging

00:11:49,449 --> 00:11:54,189
with your brand's if you can't do that

00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:55,540
you know there's there's a problem and

00:11:54,189 --> 00:11:57,790
and that's something Syria and core

00:11:55,540 --> 00:12:03,220
could be pretty useful in in correcting

00:11:57,790 --> 00:12:06,160
um finally data silos uh this I think is

00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:08,619
the item that concerns me most I spend a

00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:11,679
lot of time looking at commercial um

00:12:08,619 --> 00:12:15,100
content management systems um crown peak

00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:17,169
site life um are just a couple to come

00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:18,899
to mind and you know what are the things

00:12:17,169 --> 00:12:21,910
they really feature is integrated

00:12:18,899 --> 00:12:24,489
metrics around contacts and content you

00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:26,619
know you can figure out you know who is

00:12:24,489 --> 00:12:29,350
reading what articles based on where

00:12:26,619 --> 00:12:31,689
they came from you can also publish

00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:36,249
personalized content for those users

00:12:31,689 --> 00:12:38,350
based on other activity okay um part of

00:12:36,249 --> 00:12:39,970
the reason that it's hard to do that in

00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:42,699
Drupal is that there's not really a

00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:45,939
consolidated way to store intelligence

00:12:42,699 --> 00:12:49,029
about contacts um who are in your site

00:12:45,939 --> 00:12:51,339
and so CRM core is really meant as a as

00:12:49,029 --> 00:12:56,139
a way to deal with that as well next

00:12:51,339 --> 00:13:01,720
slide okay so enter able organizer okay

00:12:56,139 --> 00:13:03,579
um when trilling built CRM quarter one

00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:05,919
of the things we we also realized it's

00:13:03,579 --> 00:13:08,739
just the fact that this is new and this

00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:11,379
is an idea that not a lot of people are

00:13:08,739 --> 00:13:13,569
going to be bought into what kind of

00:13:11,379 --> 00:13:15,819
familiar with when we originally started

00:13:13,569 --> 00:13:18,850
working on a table or dice or what we

00:13:15,819 --> 00:13:19,870
wanted to do was to you know by and

00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:21,970
large

00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:24,130
showcase the technology and features

00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:26,200
that are there and kind of I have this

00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:30,610
vision for technology that people could

00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:32,350
could easily understand um it's secondly

00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:35,050
what we really wanted to do you know

00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:37,720
with this distro is have that tool that

00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:41,260
can solve some of those goals ok there

00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:44,830
are listed above next slide the way that

00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:46,390
we did this um really was by organizing

00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:48,850
all the functionality around four key

00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:50,410
features um I've been burning trilling

00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:53,800
for about 10 years I've probably

00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:56,560
received I don't know six seven thousand

00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:59,200
rfps in that time um I actually track

00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:01,029
the features that that folks are looking

00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:03,580
for and so out of that sample of about

00:14:01,029 --> 00:14:05,350
seven thousand items the ones that

00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:07,089
popped up the most frequently are you

00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:10,150
know strong robust donation

00:14:07,089 --> 00:14:12,070
functionality on events event

00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:14,610
registration the ability to sell tickets

00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:17,370
for events you know all sorts of

00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:19,690
permutations of registration um

00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:22,029
petitions okay the ability to conduct

00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:25,930
outreach the ability to you know maybe

00:14:22,029 --> 00:14:28,420
contacting legislature or run a letter

00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:31,390
to the editor campaign um and then also

00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:34,990
volunteers the ability to get people to

00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:36,339
sign up for something um that it doesn't

00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:37,660
necessarily involve a financial

00:14:36,339 --> 00:14:40,029
commitment but it definitely involves a

00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:42,750
time commitment um would maybe there's

00:14:40,029 --> 00:14:46,450
loading / slots and in some other ends

00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:48,010
so uh what we did with a Morgan eyes

00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:49,839
first we've built to help you know all

00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:54,400
of these features and kind of thoughtful

00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:56,410
and meaningful way that could be used to

00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:58,600
serve a lot of the needs that have been

00:14:56,410 --> 00:15:03,120
expressed a lesson in rfps through

00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:03,120
organizations we've talked to next slide

00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:08,640
what else does it do though okay it's

00:15:07,089 --> 00:15:12,279
nice that we have all of these features

00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:14,290
okay but features alone don't you know

00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:17,890
make a website what really matters is

00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:19,990
what happens with the data on way gets

00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:22,000
in there and what also really matters is

00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:25,570
how flexible is you know what you can do

00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,279
with this system um outside of just the

00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:31,480
items that have already been fine for

00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:33,520
you so um sear encore is part of able

00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:35,760
organizer it allows you to configure

00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:37,600
tak activity in relationship types um

00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:40,990
let's say you're looking to track

00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:44,830
membership in your site it's pretty easy

00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:46,660
to create an activity just for

00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:49,540
membership create some rules around it

00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:51,280
to control you know wind membership

00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:53,500
expires create some reports on

00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:55,660
membership i'm going to show you the

00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:58,000
tools that that we use hable organizer

00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:59,830
here in a few minutes and they think for

00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,870
people with a little bit of experience

00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:03,550
with a triple platform it's it's going

00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:06,370
to be pretty easy to visualize how you

00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:08,140
use it in that role um the second thing

00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:09,670
that able organizer does is jerrys

00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:14,380
reports and allows you to visualize data

00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:17,470
um we have a lot of widgets like

00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:20,740
somewhere around 140 widgets that have

00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:22,450
been built out that on existing table

00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:25,120
organizer and just like to look at

00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:28,090
information in different ways we're

00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:29,740
using panels and views in order to give

00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:33,220
us some some additional leverage their

00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:35,500
on not only can can we look at data but

00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:39,190
we can construct any of those panels and

00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:42,040
um new and interesting combinations okay

00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:45,820
and then also the the widgets themselves

00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:47,380
have some i would say some some pretty

00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:49,030
good standards for how they can build

00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:50,800
that that we're going to take a look at

00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:54,190
in terms of settings and the ability and

00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:56,350
customizable so um organizations can get

00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:59,800
really the data that they need and they

00:16:56,350 --> 00:17:01,000
have ways to expand the system to to get

00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:04,180
new forms of information when they need

00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:07,000
on another thing that's kind of key

00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:10,089
table organizer is the dynamic form

00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:12,700
builder anytime we're looking to collect

00:17:10,089 --> 00:17:15,400
information about contacts maybe where

00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:17,950
we have to create an activity after it's

00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:20,470
been submitted we have this dynamic form

00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:22,150
builder it's dragons rock and it can be

00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:25,540
automatically associated with content

00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:28,420
and you can can swap forms in it out

00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:31,510
really what this means is that let's say

00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:34,390
you had for donation pages um in your

00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:37,920
site you could have four different forms

00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:40,000
to ask for information from people um

00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:42,940
really this means you have the ability

00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,740
to tailor your your asks to appeal to

00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:45,700
the audience's that you're seeking to

00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:47,980
reach

00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:49,750
um this is true for for all of the

00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:52,809
features that that are part of the

00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:54,730
system on we also have these

00:17:52,809 --> 00:17:58,149
configurable contact matching rules

00:17:54,730 --> 00:18:00,010
they're called matching engines what a

00:17:58,149 --> 00:18:01,960
matching engine is really there to do is

00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:04,720
allow you to find duplicate contacts

00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:06,580
within your database and also within

00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:10,419
external databases you know typically

00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:12,370
via via web services but a matching

00:18:10,419 --> 00:18:15,220
engine will allow you to modify a

00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:17,320
contact record when winsome is coming in

00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:19,630
let's say there's contact record for

00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:22,630
Mike haggerty and Edward Azure's been

00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:25,899
able to identify that that's match to a

00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:28,389
form that's being submitted um I could

00:18:25,899 --> 00:18:30,190
also use that to light which up the

00:18:28,389 --> 00:18:32,700
yellow pages and pull information out

00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:35,380
there oh look at my facebook account I'm

00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:38,500
Greg latest in a few tweets and

00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:41,289
automatically get those into the contact

00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:43,419
record so um matching engines are kind

00:18:41,289 --> 00:18:45,309
of a powerful tool and something i want

00:18:43,419 --> 00:18:48,370
to spend minute or two long as we as we

00:18:45,309 --> 00:18:50,049
go through here um and then finally just

00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:52,960
integration with solar commerce ruse

00:18:50,049 --> 00:18:57,789
sorry rules views panels token and other

00:18:52,960 --> 00:19:00,789
popular modules on we really sway the

00:18:57,789 --> 00:19:04,450
details when it comes to integrating

00:19:00,789 --> 00:19:07,809
with drupal what we wanted to do is make

00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:11,799
sure that there was a really clear way

00:19:07,809 --> 00:19:13,750
to UM use the system you don't need to

00:19:11,799 --> 00:19:16,450
know anything besides drupal in order to

00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:18,070
develop an able organizer if you want to

00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:20,380
build a feature you can use features

again okay so what you see on my screen

00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:44,620
is a default installation I'm able

00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:46,840
organizer okay it comes with a lot of

00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:49,330
sample contents which includes things

00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:53,560
like the online donation page that you

00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:56,320
see okay um I filled out this form while

00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:58,890
you weren't looking okay ah with some of

00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:01,540
my information so that i could

00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:04,270
demonstrate how contact information is

00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:06,700
captured and where it goes what I hit

00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:08,080
submit on this form okay what's what's

00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:11,020
happening is the donation is being

00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:12,700
processed okay where it's a payment form

00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:14,980
down at the bottom

00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:20,380
that's drupal commerce okay we're using

00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:23,560
the default commerce example payment

00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:25,120
processor there normally that the fields

00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:26,680
were you know under payment form would

00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:30,850
be replaced with a credit card

00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:33,970
processing for Rick go to my dashboard

00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:38,760
enable organizer what I'm going to see

00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:41,110
is you in this activity feed um

00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:44,680
information about the the donation that

00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:48,280
that I've just made if I was video to my

00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:52,210
contacts screen and look at the record

00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:54,130
for Michael Haggerty what I would say

00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:57,610
also is that you know that activity is

00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:59,140
reflected there as well I know we're

00:22:57,610 --> 00:23:01,240
covering a lot of ground really quickly

00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:03,940
so let me take a couple steps back and

00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:07,300
and and let's just focus on on the front

00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:10,710
end from the lab um donation pages are

00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:12,910
content plank okay you can create those

00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:15,880
from within the system you can have as

00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:17,560
many donation pages that you want we've

00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:20,560
integrated with the media module it's

00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:23,590
part of the organizer distribution so

00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:27,130
it's really easy to integrate images to

00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:30,400
video and in other items here um we have

00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:31,750
a couple of tools for mobile development

00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,850
that are integrated into the

00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:36,460
distribution as well it's pretty easy to

00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:38,170
deploy like adaptive images adapted

00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:41,590
videos and in other items that will

00:23:38,170 --> 00:23:45,340
resize to the dimensions of the device

00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:48,970
or are being used to to view it when I

00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:52,750
could edit okay we're really talking

00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:55,900
about standard drupal content types with

00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:59,230
the exception of a couple of things the

00:23:55,900 --> 00:24:00,490
first is this crm core menu okay this is

00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:03,790
built specifically for sierra

00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:05,860
coordination um each time we receive a

00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:08,590
donation we're going to generate an

00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:10,960
email message that will go out to users

00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:14,940
so that email message is defined in rule

00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:20,680
um it's being sent via via mail handler

00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:25,480
so we can say rich HTML texts on to

00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:26,680
people it sports tokens on in the body

00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:29,260
of the

00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:31,780
email messages this allows you to send

00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:34,480
highly personalized responder emails

00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:37,690
okay every time a donation is received

00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:39,970
on the select box which you see here I

00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:42,010
only have one um thank you message

00:24:39,970 --> 00:24:47,080
configured for donations I can configure

00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:50,020
more um on a per page basis we can

00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:52,720
select the responder that's going to be

00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:54,970
used to send messages out we also have

00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:56,710
recommended donation amounts one of the

00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:59,950
things that I show off here in a minute

00:24:56,710 --> 00:25:01,660
is just how carts work if we have a

00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:05,710
shopping cart that's set up for able

00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:08,800
organizer let's say we wanted to allow

00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:11,740
someone to pick from you know one of

00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:14,220
five recommended donation levels we can

00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:17,440
set those those nation routes here okay

00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:20,440
when I go into the donation form itself

00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:23,470
okay we're seeing a little display that

00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:24,730
allows us to choose what form we're

00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:28,080
actually going to associate with this

00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:32,590
page I could have four or five different

00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:35,650
donation forms in my sight the form is

00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:37,630
not the same as the page meaning that i

00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:39,670
can create my form someplace else and

00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:42,010
we'll take a look at the form builder in

00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:44,530
it but i can ask for different

00:25:42,010 --> 00:25:46,330
information in each situation and ask

00:25:44,530 --> 00:25:48,610
for the information that's appropriate

00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:52,060
for what i need one of the things that

00:25:48,610 --> 00:25:55,720
savvy digital campaign managers know is

00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:57,810
that it's always bad idea task for more

00:25:55,720 --> 00:26:00,580
information than what you need because

00:25:57,810 --> 00:26:03,160
that will drive a certain percentage of

00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:05,470
your audience away on at the same time

00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:07,420
you always want to capture certain

00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:10,000
minimal amounts of information it's

00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:12,010
never a good situation to have less than

00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:15,700
what you need and so really this is a

00:26:12,010 --> 00:26:17,260
tool that makes it very easy for people

00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:21,250
to ask for the right information when

00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:22,660
they need it and to tailor those asks if

00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:25,090
you find your donation forms are

00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:28,240
underperforming perhaps the issue is

00:26:25,090 --> 00:26:29,680
with the fields that are there um you

00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:34,240
can change that like two minutes with

00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:35,590
Ava organizer um we have this box for

00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:37,720
displaying the foreign in line with

00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:40,840
other content all of the examples enable

00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:44,140
organizer do not do this but if we

00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:46,059
wanted to we could attach the the forms

00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:48,549
themselves with with content sits there

00:26:46,059 --> 00:26:52,179
um and then finally we can control the

00:26:48,549 --> 00:26:54,970
label that that appears um let's go back

00:26:52,179 --> 00:26:57,520
to creation you know that this is the

00:26:54,970 --> 00:27:02,020
label that I'm talking about you know if

00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:04,750
we want to really tailor those tasks

00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:06,220
okay and give people actions that we're

00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:08,620
telling them to do you know within a

00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:15,640
page uh we can we can do that here

00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:18,100
pretty easily so um that is the basics

00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:21,309
of content management with Ava organizer

00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:23,799
we're adding forms to contents in the

00:27:21,309 --> 00:27:26,230
right places each one of our features

00:27:23,799 --> 00:27:29,350
comes with its own content type know

00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:32,200
there's a vent um content type of

00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:34,899
position content type etc you can add

00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:36,279
whatever field you want onto them you

00:27:34,899 --> 00:27:38,470
can integrate with the medium module in

00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:40,600
order to inject nice things like online

00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:44,110
video and images and other stuff and

00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:45,970
more importantly you can really tailor

00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:48,429
the kind of information you asked for

00:27:45,970 --> 00:27:51,419
from people in order to ask for the

00:27:48,429 --> 00:27:55,390
right information at the right time

00:27:51,419 --> 00:28:00,039
whenever we collect data about people

00:27:55,390 --> 00:28:01,899
it's stored in CRM core okay and on the

00:28:00,039 --> 00:28:03,820
tab I just switch to what you're looking

00:28:01,899 --> 00:28:08,380
at is is what the back end looks like

00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:10,419
around serum core um one thing that is

00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:11,919
really important to kind of kind of be

00:28:10,419 --> 00:28:14,679
aware of when you're looking at

00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:17,049
something like this is this is not the

00:28:14,679 --> 00:28:19,870
backend of your website okay and RuPaul

00:28:17,049 --> 00:28:23,230
usually you have front-end and you have

00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:25,990
um a back-end you know it like the

00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:27,100
administration section on Wisteria I'm

00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:30,190
core one of the things we're really

00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:33,940
conscious about is the fact that crm is

00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:36,340
kind of like a DMZ between admin and the

00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:40,630
front end you know it has some UI

00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:44,169
challenges we built a unique thing just

00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:45,970
for handling the the CRM section you're

00:28:44,169 --> 00:28:48,730
going to need to be replaced tools

00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:50,289
blocks and other information in places

00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:51,970
don't belong on the front and they don't

00:28:50,289 --> 00:28:54,270
belong in the administrative section so

00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:54,270
um

00:28:54,520 --> 00:29:04,100
we've got the UI support to allow people

00:28:57,950 --> 00:29:07,390
to really customize the um sorry the

00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:10,460
interface for for managing contacts um

00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:12,650
this is the dashboard okay by default

00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:15,080
this is what you get when your work with

00:29:12,650 --> 00:29:17,510
able organizer to the left you'll see a

00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:19,400
nice long Activity Feed with all the

00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:22,990
actions that have been going on the site

00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:26,060
um this lists 50 items at a time um

00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:28,520
we've turned on the infinite scroll with

00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:31,880
this in the past it's not in the distro

00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:33,350
um but you know it's perfectly fine if

00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:36,080
you want to have the ability to scroll

00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:37,940
back you know until the end of time for

00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:42,140
free so let me getting the time for your

00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:44,150
site um over on the right we have a set

00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:47,360
of Quick Links to allow us to create

00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:50,540
content on to manage profiles to record

00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:53,300
new activities and other information and

00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:55,610
we also have some basic summary info

00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:59,210
about the features that are configured

00:29:55,610 --> 00:30:00,980
for your site for this website we've had

00:29:59,210 --> 00:30:02,390
a total of forty-seven donations we've

00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:05,030
received five thousand three hundred

00:30:02,390 --> 00:30:11,050
fifty dollars and the average amount of

00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:13,370
iteration is 113 dollars um it's good

00:30:11,050 --> 00:30:16,100
motion on profits would be happy with

00:30:13,370 --> 00:30:18,170
the average donation amounts I think

00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:21,470
many of them would like to the donations

00:30:18,170 --> 00:30:22,970
but really the point is you can get to

00:30:21,470 --> 00:30:26,740
that information very quickly using

00:30:22,970 --> 00:30:32,470
using dashboard dashboard is also panel

00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:35,740
like I said organizer ships with bouts

00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:37,970
it's about a hundred thirty different

00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:41,540
widgets that can be displayed within

00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:43,100
paths it'll just poke real quick and

00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:46,790
proud of the fact we built so many of

00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:49,970
these things um each of the items that

00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:51,520
um you see is also used in reports which

00:30:49,970 --> 00:30:55,580
we're going to get into in a minute um

00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:59,510
if we found that information about

00:30:55,580 --> 00:31:01,670
petitions was the top line item for this

00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:04,670
site that's why it's being built we

00:31:01,670 --> 00:31:06,950
could take widgets out of reports and

00:31:04,670 --> 00:31:08,060
put them into the dashboard in order to

00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:10,730
make it really

00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:12,500
to get at that information and draw

00:31:10,730 --> 00:31:15,620
people into just the correct stuff

00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:18,050
that's there so um if you go through

00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:20,020
serum or event and donations you'll see

00:31:18,050 --> 00:31:23,240
that there's a bunch of others there um

00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:25,810
we'll talk a little bit more about our

00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:28,910
our widgets here and in just a minute um

00:31:25,810 --> 00:31:31,760
so the dashboard is kind of a hub okay

00:31:28,910 --> 00:31:35,350
when you getting the CRM section for

00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:38,330
fravel organizer we also have our

00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:41,570
contacts page this gives us a rundown of

00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:43,190
the contacts that are in the site um one

00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:46,220
of the things I guess I just wanted to

00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:48,980
test Assize here is this is view we have

00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:52,250
used bulk operations associated with

00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:54,080
with our contact look up screens um we

00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:56,990
can delete contacts we can join them in

00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:58,580
households we can merge them we can do

00:31:56,990 --> 00:32:00,860
math edits if i want to change

00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:03,290
everybody's last name to haggerty so

00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:05,450
they're cool like me um that's that

00:32:03,290 --> 00:32:08,090
that's not really tough we can also send

00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:10,850
email messages on we have the ability to

00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:14,870
send emails through constant contact

00:32:10,850 --> 00:32:17,900
MailChimp um we can use manual for smtp

00:32:14,870 --> 00:32:20,660
support there's also the smtp module if

00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:26,870
we just want to push messages um through

00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:28,580
another server so it's pretty easy to

00:32:26,870 --> 00:32:30,800
communicate with your contacts just

00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:35,270
using this screen since this screen is a

00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:38,390
view um we're able to clone it we can

00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:40,130
create multiple views of contacts if we

00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:41,510
wanted a way to just look at individuals

00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:44,090
and then a way to just look at

00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:48,770
organizations um it's pretty easy to do

00:32:44,090 --> 00:32:51,980
that as well um let's also talk about

00:32:48,770 --> 00:32:56,600
reports real quick and just you know in

00:32:51,980 --> 00:33:01,970
terms of an overview um all reports the

00:32:56,600 --> 00:33:04,850
ship with the system are set up to the

00:33:01,970 --> 00:33:06,940
templates okay they give a lot of useful

00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:10,010
information but at the same time on

00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:13,070
you're able to clone them you're able to

00:33:10,010 --> 00:33:15,410
customize them there's a lot of

00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:19,340
different widgets that specifically can

00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:20,690
be customized um it's about 30 reports

00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:22,100
actually that that

00:33:20,690 --> 00:33:25,160
that ship with it I know these lists

00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:28,160
look a little small on reports are we're

00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:30,590
going to organized by the kind of

00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:33,230
subject matter so the nation reports are

00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:35,840
up here donor reports right here they

00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:40,310
both come out of the donation module but

00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:44,030
um we have a small API around how

00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:46,490
reports are defined and different

00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:49,700
features can define different types of

00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:51,500
reports or the need so just to give you

00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:54,080
a sense of what some of our reports look

00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:56,840
like um we've got some decent

00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:58,310
visualization options um you're going to

00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:59,540
see a lot of pie charts you're gonna see

00:33:58,310 --> 00:34:02,900
a lot of line graphs and you're going to

00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:05,420
see a lot of martial arts um each one is

00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:08,120
a widget like I said that you can

00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:12,680
configure what data is going to appear

00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:15,830
um as you go through it let me just jump

00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:17,390
back here one of the things that people

00:34:15,830 --> 00:34:20,540
actually always get excited about when I

00:34:17,390 --> 00:34:23,210
do a demo available organizer is when I

00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:26,690
just move around highcharts and line

00:34:23,210 --> 00:34:27,950
charts I've been sitting on calls for

00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:32,450
people are just like oh well that's

00:34:27,950 --> 00:34:35,510
amazing um it demonstrates a design

00:34:32,450 --> 00:34:38,240
principle that has gone into the system

00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:40,010
really we think that the strongest

00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:41,570
organizations that that we've ever

00:34:40,010 --> 00:34:44,930
worked with you know here at R Eleanor

00:34:41,570 --> 00:34:47,690
ones that their data informed they don't

00:34:44,930 --> 00:34:52,370
like canned reports they like metrics

00:34:47,690 --> 00:34:55,340
that are streamlined um to the kind of

00:34:52,370 --> 00:34:56,810
organization they were um where people

00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:59,290
can interact with them and customize

00:34:56,810 --> 00:35:02,120
them in in the manner they choose and

00:34:59,290 --> 00:35:05,060
where the metrics themselves sort of

00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:07,850
reflect the brand um some of the

00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:09,770
organizations that that do the best okay

00:35:07,850 --> 00:35:12,560
where we've achieved best outcomes with

00:35:09,770 --> 00:35:14,300
them as partners um have been the ones

00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:17,090
that that have really been able to get

00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:19,820
strong actual intelligence and share in

00:35:17,090 --> 00:35:22,070
real time with with the groups and our

00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:26,030
reports have been built to reflect that

00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:29,120
okay hey Ryan edit yeah yeah we had a

00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:32,570
question is there a default way to

00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:34,730
segment content contacts based on

00:35:32,570 --> 00:35:42,650
specific criteria and

00:35:34,730 --> 00:35:46,340
or them as groups great question um in

00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:48,770
order to segment contacts you want to

00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:52,190
configure the system a little bit we

00:35:48,770 --> 00:35:55,369
didn't put a default in place the reason

00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:58,670
is that we didn't want to force people

00:35:55,369 --> 00:36:02,270
to do things one way or another on crm

00:35:58,670 --> 00:36:04,790
core integrates with organic groups for

00:36:02,270 --> 00:36:06,710
people who are looking to do that um you

00:36:04,790 --> 00:36:11,930
know we could certainly store contacts

00:36:06,710 --> 00:36:14,150
that way associated um what I'm really

00:36:11,930 --> 00:36:17,510
fond of is the idea of tagging contacts

00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:20,600
on creating a simple taxonomy where

00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:25,040
people can organically build up their

00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:29,030
own I groups of contacts and can do it

00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:31,280
collectively so really the segmentation

00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:34,850
options that are supported are those

00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:36,530
that are there for content you know

00:36:34,850 --> 00:36:39,910
within within Drupal we don't really

00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:42,950
draw a line or do we try to impose a

00:36:39,910 --> 00:36:48,619
single way of organizing those on on

00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:54,080
people using the system any other

00:36:48,619 --> 00:37:00,680
questions or I guess I just wanna make

00:36:54,080 --> 00:37:03,050
money yeah so um so let's see um I think

00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:07,010
this I don't know that let me just see

00:37:03,050 --> 00:37:10,340
here able organizer looks very promising

00:37:07,010 --> 00:37:13,250
to some groups I work with however these

00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:15,670
groups have annual memberships that need

00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:19,460
to be managed with a yearly calendar

00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:22,880
does organizer have a default membership

00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:27,980
type of setup ie active member versus

00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:30,380
lapsed or potential sure um we have not

00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:33,580
built a membership feature fravel

00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:37,970
organizer on there's reason for that

00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:39,230
number one lots of different groups have

00:37:37,970 --> 00:37:41,930
lots of different membership

00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:44,150
requirements and we haven't tried to it

00:37:41,930 --> 00:37:46,970
to tackle that you know by the time we

00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:48,110
finished building it um there's some

00:37:46,970 --> 00:37:49,790
segments that

00:37:48,110 --> 00:37:51,080
is not going to want to work with it you

00:37:49,790 --> 00:37:53,650
know a period just because it doesn't

00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:56,920
match their exact workflow and

00:37:53,650 --> 00:37:58,490
membership is essential to life blood of

00:37:56,920 --> 00:38:02,090
associations and membership

00:37:58,490 --> 00:38:04,400
organizations um what number two there

00:38:02,090 --> 00:38:07,130
is support for membership when we go

00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:12,290
into the administrative section of serum

00:38:07,130 --> 00:38:14,060
or we can build an activity type on for

00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:16,880
membership where we capture the

00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:18,260
appropriate information um tie it to an

00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:21,200
activity record that gets associated

00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:24,200
with context we can use serum court

00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:26,180
profile to build the forms that allow

00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:30,200
people you know to actually register and

00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:32,480
we can use our reporting tools um to

00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:35,060
allow us to to generate really strong

00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:39,500
reports around it we can also use rules

00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:41,750
in order to handle the details around

00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:45,590
like grace periods and signup periods

00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:46,850
and end of membership periods to make

00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:48,260
sure you're communicating with members

00:38:46,850 --> 00:38:54,290
and going kind of community that you

00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:57,770
want so um the answer is it's there but

00:38:54,290 --> 00:39:00,080
it's not there okay um after Charlotte

00:38:57,770 --> 00:39:01,820
has a new website coming out and once

00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:03,740
for any web slaves launched I'm actually

00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:05,960
writing a serious blog post about this

00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:08,150
I'm really just focused on how you

00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:10,520
configure membership with a naval

00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:12,830
organizer just because it's not a

00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:16,430
feature doesn't mean you can't build it

00:39:12,830 --> 00:39:19,280
yourself um and you can vote it yourself

00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:22,490
probably an afternoon you know if you

00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:24,980
follow a layout um I don't know if I ask

00:39:22,490 --> 00:39:29,770
you this question but hopefully it does

00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:32,480
great Mike that's great another question

00:39:29,770 --> 00:39:35,330
what would be involved in changing the

00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:40,220
term donations to payments within the

00:39:35,330 --> 00:39:45,230
system that's not too hard um what you'd

00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:48,920
want to do is go under sorry your serum

00:39:45,230 --> 00:39:53,810
core menu go into activity types okay

00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:58,190
where it says donation what did we want

00:39:53,810 --> 00:40:00,800
to change it to payments yeah so we

00:39:58,190 --> 00:40:04,000
would change it to payments here okay

00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:06,340
um anytime someone is creating a

00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:08,360
donation record that's now renamed

00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:11,750
payments you know now that would be

00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:16,970
captured that way when we look at our

00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:22,640
actual reports Oliver reports really

00:40:16,970 --> 00:40:26,840
built to run views and we have these

00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:29,450
panels we could change payments for each

00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:30,770
one of these widgets as well it's a sort

00:40:29,450 --> 00:40:33,200
of thing that might take about an hour

00:40:30,770 --> 00:40:35,930
but you can you can replace everything

00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:40,340
manually that way um we haven't

00:40:35,930 --> 00:40:43,340
attempted to like localize specific

00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:46,790
strings um I imagine that you can also

00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:49,310
use the localized module or the locale

00:40:46,790 --> 00:40:51,350
module sorry um in order to accomplish

00:40:49,310 --> 00:40:53,060
the same thing I just worry about

00:40:51,350 --> 00:40:57,470
whether or not it would would really

00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:59,740
work in all all cases okay great and

00:40:57,470 --> 00:41:04,310
then well one other question our

00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:08,840
contacts nodes contacts are not notes

00:41:04,310 --> 00:41:11,300
contacts are their own HD defined in CRM

00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:13,400
court what you're going to find is that

00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:16,060
a lot of the folks that exist around

00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:18,410
notes would just be inappropriate in

00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:21,080
managing contacts there's a whole other

00:41:18,410 --> 00:41:23,930
event model that's there if you go to

00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:25,370
droop off work and go to the CRM core

00:41:23,930 --> 00:41:28,490
project you're going to find there's

00:41:25,370 --> 00:41:30,890
extensive documentation around the data

00:41:28,490 --> 00:41:34,820
model what excuse are there what modules

00:41:30,890 --> 00:41:38,750
are there and um I wrote most of it I'm

00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:40,130
kind of loquacious so um I think you'll

00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:42,590
find it that that there's good

00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:44,600
documentation and you can certainly

00:41:42,590 --> 00:41:50,560
reach out to me if later if you want to

00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:55,400
talk about that in detail great great

00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:59,090
that is all we have for questions Mike

00:41:55,400 --> 00:42:02,240
do you uh are you complete with your

00:41:59,090 --> 00:42:04,400
demo should we um what I wanted to give

00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:06,260
me two or three minutes to look at your

00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:08,090
absolutely and and we'll we'll dive in

00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:09,530
those were those were great questions

00:42:08,090 --> 00:42:12,950
and you know I appreciate that and

00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:14,540
thanks everybody but um really I was

00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:16,820
kind of getting to the meat of this

00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:20,150
um and I apologize if I was a little

00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:21,500
focused on some of the nuances about you

00:42:20,150 --> 00:42:23,210
know our reports and our charts and

00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:25,990
everything but I did want to just deal

00:42:23,210 --> 00:42:29,030
with the subject of data for a minute um

00:42:25,990 --> 00:42:31,190
like I said data-driven organizations

00:42:29,030 --> 00:42:35,300
are you know are one thing but they

00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:37,820
informed organizations are another you

00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:40,520
know when when you work for a group that

00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:42,350
makes decisions based around analytics

00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:45,320
you can either listen to the analytics

00:42:42,350 --> 00:42:48,650
um and it just kind of slave Ashley do

00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:50,390
what they say um or you can kind of

00:42:48,650 --> 00:42:52,540
permit people in your groups and

00:42:50,390 --> 00:42:55,580
creativity and freedom of expression and

00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:57,590
use metrics is a way of just informing

00:42:55,580 --> 00:42:59,660
ongoing decisions about what you do and

00:42:57,590 --> 00:43:01,730
able organizers really built to fall

00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:03,920
into that second camp I just want to

00:43:01,730 --> 00:43:05,210
talk a little bit about the the kinds of

00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:08,360
intelligence you can get out of the

00:43:05,210 --> 00:43:12,770
system just by looking at some of our

00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:14,750
donation reports for a moment um every

00:43:12,770 --> 00:43:17,650
piece of data that we collect an able

00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:21,020
organizer is tied to a source um there's

00:43:17,650 --> 00:43:23,510
sources for all the different features

00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:25,930
that we talked about here today if we

00:43:23,510 --> 00:43:28,550
were to take a look at the sources that

00:43:25,930 --> 00:43:31,160
we have configured for this site we see

00:43:28,550 --> 00:43:34,280
fundraisers are really the most popular

00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:35,960
source that that we have these are the

00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:39,560
kinds of appeals you really want to

00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:43,310
focus on with your audience um about a

00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:45,500
source history page this shows me you

00:43:43,310 --> 00:43:47,710
know since the beginning of time what

00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:51,080
donations we've received for the source

00:43:47,710 --> 00:43:53,120
it shows me also that people who make

00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:55,670
donations through the source really only

00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:57,500
like to give one time and that's it so

00:43:55,670 --> 00:43:59,090
we don't really need to focus on sending

00:43:57,500 --> 00:44:00,890
them a lot of emails and stuff there

00:43:59,090 --> 00:44:04,730
once they've given once they're they're

00:44:00,890 --> 00:44:06,530
kind of done um we know that people who

00:44:04,730 --> 00:44:09,620
give to the source like to give between

00:44:06,530 --> 00:44:11,840
100 and 250 dollars if I'm sending an

00:44:09,620 --> 00:44:13,760
email to people maybe what I want to do

00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:16,640
is say look can you contribute two

00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:19,220
hundred dollars now since that's really

00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:21,320
the most popular kind of donation to

00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:23,900
receive here and then finally I know

00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:26,870
that people who do give to the source

00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:28,140
also like to give to walk ups annual

00:44:26,870 --> 00:44:30,390
appeals and on

00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:33,030
duration campaigns so if i wanted to

00:44:30,390 --> 00:44:35,280
send an email to people okay maybe what

00:44:33,030 --> 00:44:38,580
I want to do instead of asking them to

00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:40,200
donate to my fundraiser is to ask them

00:44:38,580 --> 00:44:41,940
to get involved in walk up or annual

00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:44,550
appeal because that's that's kind of a

00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:47,820
popular Avenue you know for folks who

00:44:44,550 --> 00:44:50,790
are being involved um we also have our

00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:53,520
online donation pages um this is a

00:44:50,790 --> 00:44:54,990
special kind of source uh donation pages

00:44:53,520 --> 00:45:05,190
exist in the site they're not really

00:44:54,990 --> 00:45:07,410
meant for use as sorry for on capturing

00:45:05,190 --> 00:45:08,940
other activity okay you really just want

00:45:07,410 --> 00:45:12,930
to use these for interacting with users

00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:15,630
on your site if I go down into the list

00:45:12,930 --> 00:45:17,580
of pages okay if donation pages I exist

00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:20,220
I see that my fundraiser page is the

00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:23,670
most popular and if I was to go into

00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:28,200
that whoops sorry it's ansari report for

00:45:23,670 --> 00:45:32,550
that what i would see is that people

00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:35,340
like to give on saturdays to the source

00:45:32,550 --> 00:45:38,700
and also that the highest dollar totals

00:45:35,340 --> 00:45:42,300
and we've received is on mondays i also

00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:44,730
see that people like to give at around

00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:47,850
five o'clock in the morning okay based

00:45:44,730 --> 00:45:52,380
on these metrics um it's a good idea to

00:45:47,850 --> 00:45:54,270
send emails on sunday night around

00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:56,820
midnight slow be in people's inbox first

00:45:54,270 --> 00:46:01,050
thing in the morning on based on these

00:45:56,820 --> 00:46:03,450
metrics um a data informed organization

00:46:01,050 --> 00:46:05,820
sits down reads through all of that

00:46:03,450 --> 00:46:09,390
stuff and is able to get actionable

00:46:05,820 --> 00:46:12,390
intelligence quickly um the level of

00:46:09,390 --> 00:46:15,720
these reports are generated at is is not

00:46:12,390 --> 00:46:18,000
really at the level of you know a chief

00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:20,070
information officer or chief financial

00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:23,700
officer if he was looking to maximize

00:46:20,070 --> 00:46:25,920
yields you know they could be okay these

00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:29,790
reports are really written for the team

00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:31,560
that's running a campaign and has you

00:46:29,790 --> 00:46:33,900
know found themselves two weeks into it

00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:36,210
and you know they've collected 75

00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:38,850
percent of what they're after um you

00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:40,500
have real quick ways to get actionable

00:46:38,850 --> 00:46:41,640
intelligence about what you're doing and

00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:43,799
kind of work fit

00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:46,109
um there's a lot of other things under

00:46:43,799 --> 00:46:48,210
the hood I could go on and on and on um

00:46:46,109 --> 00:46:51,779
but I did promise Stephanie that ice

00:46:48,210 --> 00:46:53,910
putting ramped up here so um with that I

00:46:51,779 --> 00:46:55,319
guess we could just go back to the slide

00:46:53,910 --> 00:46:56,579
so I just would applaud everybody at

00:46:55,319 --> 00:47:01,529
where you can go to find out more

00:46:56,579 --> 00:47:04,019
information just one second and we will

00:47:01,529 --> 00:47:09,299
get back here we have a few more

00:47:04,019 --> 00:47:11,130
questions to for you Mike sure so let's

00:47:09,299 --> 00:47:13,950
have you finish and then I'll ask the

00:47:11,130 --> 00:47:18,859
questions how about that it sounds hey

00:47:13,950 --> 00:47:22,140
it sounds perfect okay um let me just

00:47:18,859 --> 00:47:24,150
tap here um so there's some facts

00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:26,579

00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:05,880
drupal.org is just call it able

00:49:04,740 --> 00:49:11,370
organizer that's where you can do it

00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:14,880
download next Laye okay big red question

00:49:11,370 --> 00:49:19,140
marks means time for questions it's

00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:23,790
together alright so how easy is it to

00:49:19,140 --> 00:49:25,470
add CRM core to an existing site are you

00:49:23,790 --> 00:49:27,330
install it the same way you would any

00:49:25,470 --> 00:49:30,330
other module there's there's nothing

00:49:27,330 --> 00:49:32,730
really special about it okay great

00:49:30,330 --> 00:49:35,400
there's also complete installation

00:49:32,730 --> 00:49:37,680
instructions um that exist in the

00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:39,600
documentation I encourage folks to read

00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:42,780
that and and and feel free to get in

00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:45,390
touch with us if if you're confused okay

00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:49,230
great and are there any simple

00:49:45,390 --> 00:49:51,420
integration for individuals in the

00:49:49,230 --> 00:49:57,150
organization to build their own donation

00:49:51,420 --> 00:49:58,980
pages or drives yeah so personalized

00:49:57,150 --> 00:50:02,460
donation pages i think is what we're

00:49:58,980 --> 00:50:06,540
asking about um it's it's not too tough

00:50:02,460 --> 00:50:08,700
okay to give members in your

00:50:06,540 --> 00:50:10,500
organization the ability to create their

00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:11,880
own donation pages and edit the

00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:17,760
reputation pages you do that just

00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:22,290
through um I'm sorry you do that just

00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:25,200
through third ripples user um air fit

00:50:22,290 --> 00:50:26,760
your user permission system with

00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:28,620
personal donation campaigns usually

00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:31,500
there's two things they're also kind of

00:50:28,620 --> 00:50:34,430
important um the first is to have some

00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:37,560
metrics and analytics around what you um

00:50:34,430 --> 00:50:40,110
you've collected personally and then

00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:42,480
secondly the ability to you know have

00:50:40,110 --> 00:50:45,180
personalized responses like a really

00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:49,260
nice thank you page or or something else

00:50:45,180 --> 00:50:52,820
so um I guess my answer there is it's

00:50:49,260 --> 00:50:56,160
not hard um it's also not trivial so um

00:50:52,820 --> 00:50:57,480
that's probably worth sharing some

00:50:56,160 --> 00:51:01,050
knowledge about you know through through

00:50:57,480 --> 00:51:04,059
some blog posts and if anyone wants to

00:51:01,050 --> 00:51:07,029
reach out to me you know at trolling com

00:51:04,059 --> 00:51:09,160
I'm happy to follow up on that and talk

00:51:07,029 --> 00:51:11,979
talk it through with you at least it's

00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:17,229
uh it's it's not it's not terribly hard

00:51:11,979 --> 00:51:19,569
Oh put it that way okay great out of the

00:51:17,229 --> 00:51:23,709
box how does one customize the front

00:51:19,569 --> 00:51:28,479
page this attendee found it difficult at

00:51:23,709 --> 00:51:33,789
first stab Oh got it so the front page

00:51:28,479 --> 00:51:36,729
is blocks you can turn those blocks off

00:51:33,789 --> 00:51:41,680
anytime you want just by going to like

00:51:36,729 --> 00:51:43,359
admin structure blocks on that allow you

00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:45,819
shut off all of the blocks there there

00:51:43,359 --> 00:51:47,829
okay the the theme that's being used

00:51:45,819 --> 00:51:49,209
your you're not forced to use that theme

00:51:47,829 --> 00:51:54,249
that's our attempt to make it a little

00:51:49,209 --> 00:52:00,430
prettier um then like garlic um you can

00:51:54,249 --> 00:52:02,619
turn that off as well okay great and how

00:52:00,430 --> 00:52:05,109
does a b'lore ganai zur integrate with

00:52:02,619 --> 00:52:08,229
MailChimp and constant contact is it a

00:52:05,109 --> 00:52:13,109
true integration or an export import

00:52:08,229 --> 00:52:17,259
capability um really good questions on

00:52:13,109 --> 00:52:19,619
those modules I didn't personally work

00:52:17,259 --> 00:52:23,170
on so I just don't know the answer um

00:52:19,619 --> 00:52:25,089
it's something that that I I think we

00:52:23,170 --> 00:52:28,599
could could dive into at you know at

00:52:25,089 --> 00:52:30,189
some point but reach out to me i'm not

00:52:28,599 --> 00:52:32,499
an offline if you'd like to if you'd

00:52:30,189 --> 00:52:38,739
like to chat about it perfect perfect

00:52:32,499 --> 00:52:41,920
and also for an existing site can the

00:52:38,739 --> 00:52:43,269
complete able organizer be installed or

00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:45,729
does it need to be installed in

00:52:43,269 --> 00:52:48,819
increments via installing individual

00:52:45,729 --> 00:52:51,880
modules and painstakingly configuring

00:52:48,819 --> 00:52:55,390
each one to match the total config for

00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:58,089
the able organizer release mmm okay i

00:52:55,390 --> 00:53:01,059
don't like words like painstaking though

00:52:58,089 --> 00:53:03,459
i think that's a loaded question now i'm

00:53:01,059 --> 00:53:07,269
not going to say it's pain free however

00:53:03,459 --> 00:53:09,429
I'm to install into an existing site you

00:53:07,269 --> 00:53:13,089
would need to get your CRM core modules

00:53:09,429 --> 00:53:15,160
and their dependencies um you also need

00:53:13,089 --> 00:53:16,510
to get serampore profile you would also

00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:19,150
need to get you know

00:53:16,510 --> 00:53:23,020
donation or event or rich sorry

00:53:19,150 --> 00:53:27,190
volunteer or petition and turn those on

00:53:23,020 --> 00:53:29,350
um in terms of actual configuration okay

00:53:27,190 --> 00:53:32,230
there's really only five configuration

00:53:29,350 --> 00:53:34,720
steps they're needed um you need to set

00:53:32,230 --> 00:53:37,930
up your matching engines you need to set

00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:43,600
up your payment processors if they're

00:53:37,930 --> 00:53:47,140
not already um and mail system or mail

00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:48,850
handler we need to get set up um there

00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:52,300
might be two other steps but that's

00:53:48,850 --> 00:53:55,300
probably if you have an elaborate site

00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:58,540
already um you probably have these

00:53:55,300 --> 00:54:02,910
things in place as well so um I I

00:53:58,540 --> 00:54:06,190
wouldn't call that painstaking no okay

00:54:02,910 --> 00:54:12,220
great Mike well that is that's it for

00:54:06,190 --> 00:54:15,040
questions and yeah is there any final

00:54:12,220 --> 00:54:17,380
words you'd like to say before we close

00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:19,690
out yeah i just thank you thank you to

00:54:17,380 --> 00:54:23,020
those of you who came to listen um I

00:54:19,690 --> 00:54:24,700
appreciate your your attention um like I

00:54:23,020 --> 00:54:26,950
said the start of this my hope was that

00:54:24,700 --> 00:54:28,780
I kind of moved the dial in terms of

00:54:26,950 --> 00:54:32,110
thinking about what Drupal is capable of

00:54:28,780 --> 00:54:34,300
doing um I don't really think of Drupal

00:54:32,110 --> 00:54:36,190
as a content management system anymore I

00:54:34,300 --> 00:54:39,280
think of it isn't anything management

00:54:36,190 --> 00:54:41,980
system and this this distro is really an

00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:44,430
attempt to get there so to you know kind

00:54:41,980 --> 00:54:46,630
of my peers and in the community it's uh

00:54:44,430 --> 00:54:50,070
take a look and let me know what you're

00:54:46,630 --> 00:54:52,840
thinking I'd love to hear your thoughts

00:54:50,070 --> 00:54:55,960
wonderful well Mike thank you so much
