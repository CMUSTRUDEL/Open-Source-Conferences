going on in Drupal con and Tim will give

00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:10,799
an update on drupal.org before we begin

00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:14,400
though I want to give a special thanks

00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:18,210
to all of the supporters your funds go

00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:21,840
directly to Tim's team and the

00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:26,040
drupal.org costs it's because of you

00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:28,290
that we're able to host our website

00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:30,210
create the developer tools and as you

00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:32,040
know it's a really unique system that's

00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:35,790
designed just to support our community

00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:38,340
which is you know important that we

00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:39,990
maintain that keep it working but we

00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:41,700
also have some really exciting news of

00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:44,460
what Tim is doing to make it even better

00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:47,310
for you but so first things for all the

00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:48,750
funding in this way and of course all

00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:50,790
the other things you do for the project

00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:54,090
no one recognises that more than we do

00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:56,100
so why don't we go ahead and dive in

00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:57,810
some Drupal Association news that you

00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:00,540
might have missed is that we've had our

00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:04,200
annual board elections where the

00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:07,259
community self nominates and campaigns

00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:10,500
and then the community votes on the next

00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:11,550
board member and we are really excited

00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:14,010
for

00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:15,620
Suzanne Jirga Chava I hope I pronounced

00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:18,420
that right I'm still working on that

00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:22,680
we're really excited that she has been

00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:25,890
nominated to be on the board for the

00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:29,370
next two years you might know her she is

00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:31,740
Kohinoor we've all been web and and she

00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:32,880
has done lots of training lots of ways

00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:35,490
that she's been involved in the

00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:37,800
community for many many years so Suzanne

00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:42,750
welcome we're excited to have you all so

00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:44,940
another supporting partner you probably

00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:47,160
have heard about Drupal con Seattle we

00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:50,460
started putting some messages out there

00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:54,210
it's happening in early April of 2019 I

00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:57,990
wanted just to walk through how we are

00:02:54,210 --> 00:03:00,030
evolving and expanding it this year in

00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:05,790
the in the past it's been primarily for

00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:08,250
builders so the agencies who build for

00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:11,040
clients and the developers who work for

00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:13,170
them as well for organizations that are

00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:15,450
building in-house for different

00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:18,140
organizations and it's also been for the

00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:21,360
the people who are building drupal.org

00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:23,870
and contributing back to the project and

00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:26,880
we've taken a different approach and

00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:30,060
realize that we really need to focus on

00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:32,010
growing Drupal adoption and to do that

00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:34,080
we have to serve all the personas in the

00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:36,300
customer lifecycle everyone that has a

00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,910
decision making aspect within that

00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:41,430
customer lifecycle that means we need to

00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:43,950
be talking with decision-makers to get

00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:45,690
them to choose Drupal we need to talk

00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:48,060
with decision-makers who've already

00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:49,230
started using them to keep falling

00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:53,310
deeper in love with it

00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:56,390
so we need that decider and we also know

00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:59,430
that the decisions for Drupal the

00:03:56,390 --> 00:04:02,660
marketing organization marketing

00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:07,739
departments are strong influencers for

00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:12,360
their CMO and whoever's choosing their

00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:15,989
their CMS so we wanted to have a track

00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:18,359
that really brings in organizations or

00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:20,910
marketing departments and people using

00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:23,580
Drupal to push out content and help them

00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:24,870
be power users and see what they can do

00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:26,460
from contents

00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:29,070
strategy perspective governance

00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:30,960
perspective taxonomy learning about how

00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:34,530
to create a full more tech stack with

00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:36,419
Drupal since its API first and that's a

00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:40,979
strengths that we need to really promote

00:04:36,419 --> 00:04:43,169
to these people so we are expanding into

00:04:40,979 --> 00:04:45,510
that persona as well so you're gonna see

00:04:43,169 --> 00:04:49,229
a lot more different kinds of faces at

00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:54,900
Drupal con in Seattle of course we want

00:04:49,229 --> 00:04:57,539
to keep the Builder kind of persona and

00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:59,729
you know there are core group and we

00:04:57,539 --> 00:05:01,440
want to maintain that always and give

00:04:59,729 --> 00:05:04,770
them as much value as possible

00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:06,389
so you'll for those that have been

00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:08,669
coming to Drupal con year after year

00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:10,650
it's going to be the same experience but

00:05:08,669 --> 00:05:12,750
we're doing things to level level up

00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:14,760
that experience based on feedback that

00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:18,000
we've received and I'll go into some

00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:19,919
details about that for agency owners all

00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,870
of you supporting partners out there

00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:23,639
we're doing something different and the

00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:26,610
past we've offered the business summit

00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:29,520
and the business track but instead we're

00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:31,979
going to really have more curated

00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:34,889
content for you and it's going to be the

00:05:31,979 --> 00:05:38,340
agency leaders track and before agency

00:05:34,889 --> 00:05:42,630
owners people in your biz dev department

00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:45,000
sales marketing and it's more focused on

00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:47,910
like training and skills that you would

00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:51,090
need to be able to really compete in the

00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:55,410
marketplace for Drupal and for your

00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:58,740
business so we're going to have analysts

00:05:55,410 --> 00:06:00,599
come in and talk about the where Drupal

00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:03,030
is in the marketplace where they see

00:06:00,599 --> 00:06:04,650
Drupal as really being differentiated

00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:07,229
and how you can really amplify that in

00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:10,530
your messaging we want to have a table

00:06:07,229 --> 00:06:12,180
of CMOS since they are one of the new

00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:13,380
decision-makers out there we want to

00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:14,880
have a table where they talk about what

00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:18,240
keeps them up at night and how they made

00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:24,900
purchasing decisions we want to bring in

00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:27,000
some large implementers agencies

00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:29,280
marketing agencies and you have them

00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,229
talk about some really ambitious blue

00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:34,380
sky type of solutions that they're doing

00:06:31,229 --> 00:06:35,700
with Drupal just to give some new ideas

00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:37,530
of what you could be doing with clients

00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:38,879
and and go back and have other

00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:40,770
conversations with

00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:42,539
and then of course we'll get some

00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:44,849
training on promote Drupal and what kind

00:06:42,539 --> 00:06:46,770
of materials are going to be available

00:06:44,849 --> 00:06:49,289
for you out of the promote Drupal

00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:51,389
initiative whether it's competitive

00:06:49,289 --> 00:06:54,949
tools that you can use or new branding

00:06:51,389 --> 00:06:57,240
new messaging and things like that so

00:06:54,949 --> 00:06:59,789
there will be these different tracks and

00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:01,379
all the personas will be kind of put in

00:06:59,789 --> 00:07:04,319
different parts of the convention center

00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:06,449
because each persona kind of needs its

00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:10,559
own feel and experience in programming

00:07:06,449 --> 00:07:12,779
their own tribe so we're doing that kind

00:07:10,559 --> 00:07:14,879
of segmentation of personas but we also

00:07:12,779 --> 00:07:16,469
know there's power and bringing all

00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:19,289
these personas together and so we're

00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:21,389
gonna have cross-pollination of personas

00:07:19,289 --> 00:07:23,399
and knowledge sharing in all the ways

00:07:21,389 --> 00:07:26,550
that you're used to seeing that happen

00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:29,179
the hallway track the keynotes the

00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:31,319
social events the community programming

00:07:29,179 --> 00:07:34,559
and so hopefully you'll be able to

00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:37,529
network and make these new new people

00:07:34,559 --> 00:07:41,119
well welcome at our event and hope them

00:07:37,529 --> 00:07:41,119
find their own ramps into the community

00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:46,019
so I did talk about how we want to

00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:47,519
create more value especially for those

00:07:46,019 --> 00:07:50,579
that have been coming to Drupal con year

00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:52,559
after year we've done a lot of surveys

00:07:50,579 --> 00:07:54,419
we've had lots of roundtables got a lot

00:07:52,559 --> 00:07:55,919
of feedback from evaluations and we took

00:07:54,419 --> 00:07:57,659
all of that and started finding ways to

00:07:55,919 --> 00:08:01,289
invest in areas that people have been

00:07:57,659 --> 00:08:02,759
asking for for many years one was they

00:08:01,289 --> 00:08:04,589
feel that when we hold trainings and

00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:06,599
summits on just Monday they're just

00:08:04,589 --> 00:08:08,999
forced to choose between trainings or

00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:12,119
summit and they find a lot of value in

00:08:08,999 --> 00:08:14,909
attending more than one so we kind of

00:08:12,119 --> 00:08:18,419
research the programming for the week

00:08:14,909 --> 00:08:20,879
and created trainings and summits across

00:08:18,419 --> 00:08:26,579
Monday and Tuesday so you can choose

00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:28,529
more options and these industry summits

00:08:26,579 --> 00:08:32,490
have become really popular people really

00:08:28,529 --> 00:08:33,719
want to find their affinity groups that

00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:36,599
could have aligned more with their

00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:38,490
business focus so we've expanded the

00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:39,930
summit's to include other industries

00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:43,189
such as healthcare and finance and

00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:46,920
you'll see others like accessibility

00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:50,370
library services so there's gonna be a

00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:52,060
lot more to choose from we also know

00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:53,980
that the communities

00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:56,350
wanting more featured speakers in the

00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:58,420
funds that we could attract featured

00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:59,830
speakers especially from those outside

00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:03,100
of the community so we're really excited

00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:05,380
to be working on that now it will have

00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:07,090
we'll be announcing some of these

00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:12,310
featured speakers in September when we

00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:14,680
open up early bird pricing and we we

00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:16,600
hear that it is still a challenge for

00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:18,910
people to come to Drupal con and there's

00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:21,160
a lot of different types of contributors

00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:22,810
we would like to see at Drupal con - so

00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:25,240
we're increasing our grants and

00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:29,170
scholarships as well as our speaker

00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:32,470
inclusion fund so that we can get all

00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:34,180
kinds of people to be able to come to

00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:38,020
Drupal con making it kind of lower in

00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:39,820
that barrier for them and we know that

00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:42,880
everyone lives on coffee so we're gonna

00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:44,860
have all-day free coffee in the exhibit

00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,940
hall and of course that's by design so

00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:48,970
that we can create value for our

00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:51,760
sponsors but those are some things that

00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:55,120
we're adding extra investments into as

00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:57,730
well as bringing in these other personas

00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:59,740
a tract focused on just decision makers

00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:01,270
and a track focused on those marketing

00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:03,339
influencers like bringing in those

00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:05,640
marketing department people these are

00:10:03,339 --> 00:10:10,540
additional costs as well as we expand

00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:13,350
and we've been wanting to be mindful of

00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:18,390
how we do this it does require us to

00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:21,130
increase our pricing for next year we

00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:23,650
want to always create more and more

00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:26,230
value we haven't done a price increase

00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:27,640
in several years and so this is

00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:29,320
something we want to be really

00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:31,120
transparent about and make sure there's

00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:34,540
no surprises we've reached out with many

00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:35,860
and tested this pricing with you you

00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:38,890
know some of the feedback we got was

00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:40,660
that wow we can't believe pricing so low

00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:43,750
compared to the other conferences we go

00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:46,839
to and it's true if you look at one of

00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:49,900
our big competing conferences is NTC

00:10:46,839 --> 00:10:54,370
it's a conference for technologists that

00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:56,470
work at nonprofits and NTC costs more

00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:59,350
than even the new pricing that we have

00:10:56,470 --> 00:11:01,470
so we did increase pricing but we have

00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:04,890
still tried to remain below our

00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:08,460
quote-unquote competitors out there

00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:13,580
and so what you'll see is for early bird

00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:17,460
which is opens September 4th I believe

00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:19,650
and you'll see that we have two kinds of

00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:23,280
pricing we have the standard conference

00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:25,260
price 795 but we want to create more

00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:27,900
value for our supporters so if you're

00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:30,630
supporting partner all of your employees

00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:33,660
will get a special supporting partner

00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:36,960
price which is $200 less so it would be

00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:39,210
595 and you're gonna get an update when

00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:43,470
early bird goes on sale so that you can

00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:45,840
start taking advantage of this and of

00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:49,200
course you know with every stage at

00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:52,470
regular last chance you will continue to

00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:54,990
get that supporter price so stay tuned

00:11:52,470 --> 00:12:00,720
for when that opens up if you have any

00:11:54,990 --> 00:12:02,220
questions please let me know another

00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:07,050
thing that we're working on on the

00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:09,450
events side is an MVP we want to start

00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:12,630
seeing what the Drupal Association can

00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:17,610
do with supporters to be in front of

00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:21,000
customers more and on October 25th we

00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:23,130
are going to have a one-day event just

00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:27,180
for customers and only for supporting

00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:29,940
partners customers to come together it

00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:32,760
will be a day where we can get customers

00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:34,920
to network here aspirational business

00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:36,540
case studies so they could learn from

00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:38,040
each other or the impact ripples having

00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:41,160
in their business it could foster some

00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:43,200
great discussion we want to have some

00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:45,690
contribution case studies so customers

00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:47,730
can hear why other businesses are

00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:49,680
contributing back to the project how

00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:51,890
they could do it and why they should do

00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:54,480
it what's the business value to them

00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:57,750
we'll have a lunch and go out for lunch

00:12:54,480 --> 00:13:00,390
and come back and do breakouts and

00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:02,580
roundtable discussions this really comes

00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:04,350
from some roundtables that we had at

00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:06,120
Drupal con Nashville we brought

00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:08,100
customers together Drupal customers

00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:10,020
together for the first time and they

00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:11,610
found lots of value and just being in a

00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:15,390
room together and asking questions they

00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:17,220
may not know who to ask and just it's

00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:17,880
just good to have pure networking and so

00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:19,740
they asked us

00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:21,990
to do this supporters asked us to do

00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:24,590
this so we're excited to come up with

00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:27,810
the real you know it's a low pressure

00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:30,150
casual business day where we can bring

00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:31,950
everyone together and we're really

00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:35,220
thankful that Johnson & Johnson is

00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:38,010
donating the space in New York City it

00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:41,250
will be @jj designs office that's their

00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:43,710
design agency the room only holds 50

00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:45,510
people I think it's a good size for the

00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:47,970
first time that we're doing this I do

00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:52,650
think it will fill up quickly and the

00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:54,870
idea is that a supporter would sign up

00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:57,210
it would just be one supporter coming

00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:58,980
and they can bring up to three customers

00:13:57,210 --> 00:14:00,840
we would like it to be director or

00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:03,210
higher so that the networking is

00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:06,300
happening at the right level and there's

00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:09,240
more alignment and amongst the people

00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:12,660
that are in the room we're keeping costs

00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:14,280
really low no of course we need to get

00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:17,880
the staff out there this is unbudgeted

00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:20,400
for us they'll run this event we'll need

00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:22,020
to pay for some catering printing you

00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:23,610
know keeping the costs low we want to

00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:26,100
have a happy hour at the end so there's

00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:28,590
some cost associated with that so we're

00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:30,300
asking agencies who sign up to do this

00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:32,040
just to share the cost will be about a

00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:33,960
thousand dollars we're still working on

00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:36,300
the budget but you know it'd be about a

00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:39,660
thousand dollars per agency we're not

00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:40,950
asking for sponsorships and every the

00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:44,790
way this will be billed out to the

00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:47,160
customers on the day of is that is being

00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:50,010
presented by the dripless Association

00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:52,860
all participating supporters and so all

00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:54,540
your logos will be on it with able you

00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:57,900
could have somewhere between about you

00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:59,790
know you know about 16 supporters and

00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:03,990
bringing three customers fills up the

00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:06,180
room more or less and right now I've

00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:08,520
been organizing this with media current

00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:10,920
and lilibet and commerce guys will be

00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:12,870
joining us we've had some customers from

00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:14,340
that original roundtable that want to

00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:17,700
help us with programming to make sure

00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:20,190
this is designed in a way that will

00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:22,010
resonate and create value so there's a

00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:27,810
nice little committee around this so

00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:29,550
we'll be thinking of those those members

00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:31,220
on site but we're still putting that

00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:34,370
committee together

00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:37,699
so I want to launch this around

00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:41,389
September 4th as well and that will give

00:15:37,699 --> 00:15:42,920
agencies an opportunity to sign up and

00:15:41,389 --> 00:15:45,139
about a month to go find some customers

00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:47,209
we are hoping you don't have to fly

00:15:45,139 --> 00:15:49,459
anyone in we think there's enough

00:15:47,209 --> 00:15:51,350
customers in the New York metro area

00:15:49,459 --> 00:15:52,939
that we can invite them in for a day we

00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:55,759
want this to keep stay low cost

00:15:52,939 --> 00:15:59,060
again it's an MVP and we can learn a lot

00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:59,689
from this MVP event and then after

00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:01,819
DrupalCon

00:15:59,689 --> 00:16:04,939
turn around and see how we can turn this

00:16:01,819 --> 00:16:07,730
into a roadshow at major cities in the

00:16:04,939 --> 00:16:10,600
US and europe we could take it to other

00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:12,829
parts of the world too by working with

00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:16,579
community leaders for example maybe in

00:16:12,829 --> 00:16:18,560
India or China I think there's a lot

00:16:16,579 --> 00:16:20,089
that we can do here and honestly my

00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,949
ultimate vision is turn this into a

00:16:20,089 --> 00:16:23,810
Drupal digital experience and bringing

00:16:21,949 --> 00:16:26,540
another technology they're having a very

00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:28,009
strong broad open source focus where

00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:29,600
Drupal is a part of it I think this

00:16:28,009 --> 00:16:35,029
could be a lot bigger and we can really

00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:37,370
grow this so stay tuned on that on that

00:16:35,029 --> 00:16:38,600
launch but maybe you want to start

00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:43,130
thinking of this is something you want

00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:44,959
to do and which customers in the Greater

00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:51,199
New York area you would like to invite

00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:52,910
to attend many of you have heard about

00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:55,839
our promote Drupal initiative that

00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:57,980
juries announced at Drupal con Nashville

00:16:55,839 --> 00:17:01,089
we know that there needs to be some

00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:07,039
standardization of messaging collateral

00:17:01,089 --> 00:17:09,919
you know sales tools just varies PR very

00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:12,380
different initiatives that everyone can

00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:16,039
just grab and use so that we're more

00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:17,809
efficient as a business ecosystem I like

00:17:16,039 --> 00:17:20,689
to think of you know if I were the CEO

00:17:17,809 --> 00:17:23,329
of Drupal a software company how would I

00:17:20,689 --> 00:17:26,569
get in who's my sales force and how do i

00:17:23,329 --> 00:17:29,090
Nabal them to be as effective as

00:17:26,569 --> 00:17:31,190
possible out there and as efficient as

00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:34,010
possible and of course that sales force

00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:35,299
are all of you all the agencies out

00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:37,070
there promoting Drupal in the

00:17:35,299 --> 00:17:39,649
marketplace and the services around it

00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:42,860
and so we want to really have promote

00:17:39,649 --> 00:17:44,720
Drupal serve you and help connect you to

00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:47,029
new business decision-makers

00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,889
and just make it easier to grab tools

00:17:47,029 --> 00:17:51,470
that are already available maybe it's

00:17:48,889 --> 00:17:54,200
marketing videos that you can display so

00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:55,129
you can go out there and and have

00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:58,490
something that has a really strong

00:17:55,129 --> 00:18:00,919
tested message so this is like the where

00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:03,860
we are we've announced recently that is

00:18:00,919 --> 00:18:05,509
now live we have some architecture

00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:09,620
coming together we're getting ready to

00:18:05,509 --> 00:18:12,080
launch basically an in-kind RFP where we

00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:15,080
can find someone who will create a brand

00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:17,120
book for Drupal and then we can start

00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:19,879
creating some templates with some key

00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:21,889
messaging and we want to make sure we

00:18:19,879 --> 00:18:23,450
push this out to all the regions in all

00:18:21,889 --> 00:18:26,360
the countries of the world so they can

00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:28,669
translate and even alter the messaging

00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:31,460
because every region every country has

00:18:28,669 --> 00:18:33,379
something slightly different and what's

00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:35,419
happening we have we want to give them

00:18:33,379 --> 00:18:38,330
the flexibility and autonomy but have

00:18:35,419 --> 00:18:40,220
consistent messaging and tools and then

00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:42,080
they can push that out in country so

00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:43,580
that's the general approach that we're

00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,830
taking and things are starting to happen

00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:47,720
and one of the things that we want to do

00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:50,360
immediately is a press release around

00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:53,450
Drupal 8.6 which is coming out about a

00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:55,970
week before Drupal Europe so I believe

00:18:53,450 --> 00:19:01,759
that is September 3rd that they're

00:18:55,970 --> 00:19:05,679
aiming for is an exciting dot release is

00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:09,289
we're getting much more user-friendly

00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:12,049
features for our content editors with

00:19:09,289 --> 00:19:13,639
the workflows workspaces lots of just

00:19:12,049 --> 00:19:16,850
really exciting things happening here

00:19:13,639 --> 00:19:19,070
and so we're working with the project

00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:21,769
maintainer x' to make sure we really can

00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:24,440
articulate the the new features and

00:19:21,769 --> 00:19:27,440
they're a consumable way we're writing a

00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:29,149
press release I'm looking for customer

00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:31,429
quotes if you have customers that can

00:19:29,149 --> 00:19:33,019
give testimonials without having to go

00:19:31,429 --> 00:19:37,039
through a big corporate approval please

00:19:33,019 --> 00:19:38,779
send them my way really like to

00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:42,320
highlight customer quotes for sure and

00:19:38,779 --> 00:19:45,289
then again we want to push this out to

00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:47,710
country leaders who can translate and

00:19:45,289 --> 00:19:52,340
push the press release out in-country

00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:54,769
promote Drupal is really mirroring how

00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:56,750
our technical initiatives work yes

00:19:54,769 --> 00:19:57,610
there's some leadership at the top

00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:59,200
someone who

00:19:57,610 --> 00:20:01,240
can be a project manager to make sure

00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,730
things are moving but the power comes

00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:05,200
from the distributed contributions of

00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:07,360
everyone working together to move

00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,799
something forward and so that's what we

00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:11,799
want to do starting with this press

00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:13,330
release and hopefully you can pull this

00:20:11,799 --> 00:20:15,790
together in a way that gets highlighted

00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:17,559
in the jury snow that ripple Europe so

00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:21,010
it's gonna start forming some really

00:20:17,559 --> 00:20:27,490
exciting DNA for our marketing efforts

00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:29,350
for Drupal so stay tuned for that and I

00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:31,210
mentioned Drupal Europe a few times it

00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:35,080
is coming very quickly because summer

00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:37,660
for us winter for some of you is coming

00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:39,669
to a close very quickly and will be a

00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:42,370
triple year before we know it it's

00:20:39,669 --> 00:20:45,760
September 10 through 14 the Drupal

00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:47,679
Association is there in full support we

00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:50,200
are having a board retreat the weekend

00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:53,140
before and a public board meeting Monday

come to our public board meeting and

00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:05,049
Rachel Lawson our community liaison is

organizing roundtables and one of the

00:21:05,049 --> 00:21:09,040
roundtables will be for supporting

00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:10,929
partners to come together we really want

00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:13,299
to foster a conversation about what we

00:21:10,929 --> 00:21:17,410
could be doing more together to

00:21:13,299 --> 00:21:19,150
accelerate Drupal adoption in Europe and

00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:21,220
hearing other needs that you might have

00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:23,290
so please be on the lookout for that

00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:25,360
invitation I'm always excited to have

00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:30,520
these kinds of discussions it informs

00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:32,020
our roadmap for next year ok well that's

00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:34,660
it for me I'm gonna hand it over to you

00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:36,250
Jim great um so I'm gonna give an update

00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:37,630
on drupal.org itself some of the

00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:39,700
technical side of the work that we've

00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:41,200
been doing in the past quarter and some

00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:42,970
important announcements and things that

00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:45,100
we want to make you aware of we know

00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:47,500
that a lot of supporting partners are of

00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:49,809
course involved in maintaining modules

00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:51,340
for Drupal or in contributing score and

00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:54,490
things like that and we have some

00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:56,380
exciting news coming up if you go to the

00:21:54,490 --> 00:22:02,470
first slide Megan I want to give an

00:21:56,380 --> 00:22:05,679
announcement about they get remotes on

00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:07,690
drupal.org in our tooling so there's

00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:09,220
some changes that are coming that mostly

00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:11,169
affect maintainer so they're not going

00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:13,419
to affect the you know people out there

00:22:11,169 --> 00:22:15,130
who are already have maybe automated

00:22:13,419 --> 00:22:17,410
systems for their deployment process

00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:19,150
that are cloning down Drupal to deploy

00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:21,130
and all that kind of stuff but for

00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:22,570
people on your teams who might be

00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:24,520
involved in maintaining projects there

00:22:22,570 --> 00:22:28,030
are changes coming out to a way the way

00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:30,309
that you push code to Drupal for both

00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:31,630
full projects and sandbox projects I

00:22:30,309 --> 00:22:32,980
don't want to go into all the details

00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:34,780
because I think it would get lost in a

00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:36,610
webinar format but you can go to this

00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:38,080
URL to get more information we've also

00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:41,230
included information in the latest

00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:43,510
what's new on drupal.org post and in an

00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:45,820
email to all of the project maintainer

00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:47,320
x' that went out yesterday so hopefully

00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:49,150
anyone on your team is already aware of

00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:50,320
this but I wanted to make sure that it's

00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:52,990
there as well so there's no disruption

00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:55,360
to your workflows when we make some

00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:56,830
changes to drupal.org x' tooling which

00:22:55,360 --> 00:23:00,010
is coming up soon we're gonna have a big

00:22:56,830 --> 00:23:01,419
announcement about that possibly as soon

00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:04,780
as the end of this week or early next

00:23:01,419 --> 00:23:07,030
week about some upcoming changes that

00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:09,850
are going to enable new collaboration

00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:12,910
features like inline code editing

00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:14,950
directly from a web UI code review tools

00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:18,040
that are significantly improved over

00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:19,660
what we have and merge requests so

00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:20,830
there's a lot of cool stuff coming up we

00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:22,600
talked about it a little bit in

00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:25,480
Nashville and the team has been working

00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:29,320
hard to get that going so keep an eye

00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:30,940
out for an announcement coming soon the

00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:32,290
other thing that you may have seen going

00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:34,900
on in the last couple of months as we've

00:23:32,290 --> 00:23:36,790
been continuing to accelerate the Drupal

00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:38,919
industry pages Drupal solution pages

00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:40,600
this is part of less the contribution

00:23:38,919 --> 00:23:44,220
side but more the adoption side of our

00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:46,600
work where we want to promote the

00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:49,900
tremendous stories and success stories

00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:53,740
of end-user organizations in specific

00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:55,270
industries or specific areas so we when

00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:57,549
we initially launched this we only have

00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:59,470
content for higher ed medium publishing

00:23:57,549 --> 00:24:00,580
and governments but since then we've

00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:04,210
added health care and nonprofit

00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:06,640
ecommerce and high tech content the two

00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:09,400
latest in this quarter being the

00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:12,070
e-commerce and high tech if you go to

00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:15,070
the next slide Megan the e-commerce page

00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:17,620
just focuses on

00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:19,149
all of the commerce integrations that

00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:20,799
are available for drupal the ways that

00:24:19,149 --> 00:24:24,730
customers can take advantage of that and

00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:28,889
next slide highlights a few of the like

00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:32,289
powerful stories for example busy kungfu

00:24:28,889 --> 00:24:34,059
is one of the largest food chains in all

00:24:32,289 --> 00:24:36,340
of China and it uses Drupal as the basis

00:24:34,059 --> 00:24:38,230
of its payment and point-of-sale systems

00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:39,309
that's something that for a lot of us in

00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:40,899
the Western world I think we may not

00:24:39,309 --> 00:24:42,399
have been aware of but it's it's huge

00:24:40,899 --> 00:24:43,600
it's huge for Drupal and it's a story

00:24:42,399 --> 00:24:45,130
that we wanted to get out there and

00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:49,059
there are a number of other stories as

00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:50,529
well and we're really excited about

00:24:49,059 --> 00:24:53,919
promoting them and most of these stories

00:24:50,529 --> 00:24:56,110
come from you are supporting partners in

00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:57,940
various forms and if you're interested

00:24:56,110 --> 00:25:00,850
in highlighting a story in one of these

00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:02,919
areas or in another one of the another

00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:04,779
industry then perhaps we don't have a

00:25:02,919 --> 00:25:06,639
page for you you should talk to your

00:25:04,779 --> 00:25:08,830
account managers and they can help you

00:25:06,639 --> 00:25:11,019
learn how to promote some of the

00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:13,570
tremendous work that you do and at the

00:25:11,019 --> 00:25:16,720
same time help us promote Drupal to the

00:25:13,570 --> 00:25:18,759
evaluator audience so in addition to

00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:20,769
that we added this drupal and hi-tech

00:25:18,759 --> 00:25:23,950
page this is kind of it's less an

00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:25,539
industry and more a collection of sort

00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:28,570
of high tech organizations that are

00:25:25,539 --> 00:25:32,700
known to depend on Drupal so one of the

00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:36,370
things that I like to say is that people

00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:41,019
the people who really would know the you

00:25:36,370 --> 00:25:42,429
know the the most technical users out

00:25:41,019 --> 00:25:44,080
there in the marketplace who could

00:25:42,429 --> 00:25:46,200
potentially sort of build solutions

00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:48,820
themselves many of those organizations

00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:50,049
choose Drupal for what Drupal can do in

00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:51,970
the content management space and we

00:25:50,049 --> 00:25:53,529
really wanted to highlight that so

00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:55,269
there's organizations like Red Hat and

00:25:53,529 --> 00:25:57,730
Cisco and Tesla that are all built on

00:25:55,269 --> 00:25:59,950
Drupal great stories for us to tell and

00:25:57,730 --> 00:26:02,679
in addition to that on the next slide we

00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:05,889
have again other stories from partners

00:26:02,679 --> 00:26:07,570
in our ecosystem like The Weather

00:26:05,889 --> 00:26:10,269
Channel built by media current since

00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:12,820
regions find its website that we're now

00:26:10,269 --> 00:26:14,259
highlighting as well so those are just a

00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:17,590
few of the things that we're doing to

00:26:14,259 --> 00:26:19,269
promote adoption and stories about the

00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:21,580
success of Drupal in the marketplace and

00:26:19,269 --> 00:26:24,210
a few of the latest ones that I wanted

00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:28,179
to talk about much you all know about

00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:28,890
the next improvement we've made is to

00:26:28,179 --> 00:26:30,960
the

00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:32,910
and it's a little blurry I'm afraid

00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,950
sorry about that we've updated the

00:26:32,910 --> 00:26:38,490
strategic initiatives page on drupal.org

00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:41,370
a long-term issue in the past has been

00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:43,590
that it's been difficult for an outsider

00:26:41,370 --> 00:26:45,390
to Drupal or even someone who's kind of

00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:47,400
inside but maybe not in kind of the

00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:49,500
inner circle of triple contributors to

00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:50,970
understand what are the next initiatives

00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:52,380
and what are the upcoming features and

00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:55,200
what's the roadmap of Drupal moving

00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:58,080
forward so we've put together some tools

00:26:55,200 --> 00:27:01,050
for the initiative maintainer

00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:02,520
to manage what's going on if we look at

00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:03,900
the next slide this is an example of

00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:05,280
what one of these initiative pages looks

00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:06,960
like this is for the admin UI and

00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:10,800
JavaScript modernization initiative

00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:13,320
which has been part of bringing a robust

00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:15,810
modern JavaScript interaction layer

00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:17,520
first to the administrative side of

00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:19,440
Drupal but then potentially eventually

00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:20,910
to the front-end as well and so these

00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:23,310
pages have content that sort of

00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:25,380
summarizes what the initiative is can

00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:27,090
include surveys for the initiative leads

00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:28,920
to understand what direction the market

00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:33,090
wants to see these initiative go to and

00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:34,230
next slide also includes a quick summary

00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:35,730
of what they're working on the

00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:37,350
initiative roadmap and who's

00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:40,230
participating and how you can contact

00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:42,860
them and get involved to participate as

00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:44,940
well so we think that's really useful

00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:46,620
and if you go to the next slide Meagan

00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:49,170
yeah finally it will also include these

00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:51,450
how can you help so if anyone has teams

00:27:49,170 --> 00:27:53,220
that are you can go to Drupal org slash

00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:54,600
initiatives to get right there to the

00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:57,150
list of all of the current initiatives

00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:59,250
that are in flight and you can find it

00:27:57,150 --> 00:28:01,320
at any of these landing pages how to get

00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:03,270
involved in something that might be

00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:06,360
perhaps it's important to you clients

00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:07,860
perhaps it's it important to your team's

00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:09,390
areas that they would like to contribute

00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:14,100
and this is a great place to look to

00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:15,540
find those areas of contribution some

00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:16,830
other changes that we've made over the

00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:18,660
course of the past quarter there were

00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:21,180
obviously some big security releases for

00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:24,240
Drupal in this last year and so we've

00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:26,070
made a few updates just to make it these

00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:27,300
are sort of quality of life improvements

00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:29,190
to make it easier to find information

00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:32,220
about security releases as they happen

00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:33,960
so public service announcements and

00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:36,090
security advisories are now included in

00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:38,310
the general newsfeed so they're going to

00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:40,440
be there if you're if users are not

00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:42,450
following everywhere else security

00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:44,160
advisories can now contain mole

00:28:42,450 --> 00:28:45,750
we'll see the EES so if multiple

00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:48,510
vulnerabilities are fixed in a single

00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:51,540
release it's easier for us to track that

00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:54,990
in a programmatic way and we have a

00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:57,000
better unique identifier in our API for

00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:59,090
each security advisory this is important

00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:02,040
because there's some upcoming changes to

00:28:59,090 --> 00:29:04,380
that core is doing to the security

00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:06,360
support cycle for Drupal they want to

00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:08,400
support a version further back than just

00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:09,660
the most recent version with security

00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:11,130
releases and that's going to mean that

00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:14,010
we need to be able to programmatically

00:29:11,130 --> 00:29:16,050
understand two versions back when

00:29:14,010 --> 00:29:17,370
vulnerabilities were fixed what's secure

00:29:16,050 --> 00:29:21,480
and things like that and these features

00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:24,060
will help us do that we also as you may

00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:27,210
have seen in email communication and on

00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:31,130
the site we had to focus on our GDP our

00:29:27,210 --> 00:29:33,500
compliance when gdpr took effect in May

00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:35,790
fortunately this was a really successful

00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:38,040
effort internally for the team it's

00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:39,600
perhaps not the most doesn't have the

00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:40,560
most curb appeal of any initiative that

00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:44,610
we might be working on

00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:45,780
but fortunately drupal.org even starting

00:29:44,610 --> 00:29:47,520
when it was built primarily by

00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:49,260
volunteers has always been privacy

00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:51,630
focused in terms of how we treat our

00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:53,400
user data has always been opt-in rather

00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:57,780
than opt-out oriented so our compliance

00:29:53,400 --> 00:30:00,030
was relatively simple and we're really

00:29:57,780 --> 00:30:02,490
just happy that we were able to put that

00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:03,960
out well and set a good example if

00:30:02,490 --> 00:30:05,820
you're curious about this because you

00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:07,710
maybe missed any of the the details

00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:09,870
there's an announcement about it on the

00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:11,610
Association blog and there were updates

00:30:09,870 --> 00:30:14,760
to our Terms of Service our digital

00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:18,330
advertising policy or get access policy

00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:20,220
and all of those things another small

00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:22,890
feature but that's particularly relevant

00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:25,020
to you as our supporting partners we now

00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:26,910
display all of the historical

00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:28,590
contribution credits you may have seen

00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:30,450
on your organization profiles that it

00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:32,220
showed the last three months which is

00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:34,770
the data that we use when calculating

00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:36,480
marketplace position but we know that

00:30:34,770 --> 00:30:37,680
for a lot of companies they want to be

00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:39,780
able to see the sort of their complete

00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:42,810
history of contribution and that that's

00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:44,400
even become important for contracts in

00:30:42,810 --> 00:30:47,520
certain spaces I've had people tell me

00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:49,230
about having a contract requirement

00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:51,030
that's specifically requested the

00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:53,010
organization's contribution history for

00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:56,280
a government contract in India I think

00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:58,380
it was so there's a lot of

00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:59,730
interesting data to be had there and

00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:01,110
just to make that more accessible to you

00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:04,310
we made it possible for you to see all

00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:08,400
your historical contribution data

00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:10,380
finally there's a core initiative that

00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:12,150
is kind of a combination of a Drupal

00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:16,260
Association initiative and a Drupal core

00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:17,820
initiative and it's one of our one of

00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:19,770
the early examples of us doing a much

00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:21,960
closer collaboration than we've perhaps

00:31:19,770 --> 00:31:23,670
done in the past and this is to improve

00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:25,740
course relationship with composer as

00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:29,250
many of you know composer is a key part

00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:33,510
of modern workflows for deploying Drupal

00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:36,390
sites in Drupal 8 and especially if you

00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:38,820
have clients who have a large volume of

00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:39,900
sites or you're you're managing kind of

00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:41,670
alternatives to the multi-site

00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:43,560
arrangement or you're just trying to

00:31:41,670 --> 00:31:45,480
manage kind of complex code bases across

00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:50,100
a lot of installations it can be a

00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:52,290
really big deal and so the first round

00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:53,910
of work to make Drupal support composer

00:31:52,290 --> 00:31:56,070
at all was actually sponsored by

00:31:53,910 --> 00:31:57,510
end-user organizations and we've put

00:31:56,070 --> 00:32:01,590
together a proposal for a second round

00:31:57,510 --> 00:32:03,930
of work that will that will further

00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:05,250
enhance the way that composers news by

00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:07,710
core it'll kind of make it the default

00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:09,570
interaction model and that'll lay the

00:32:07,710 --> 00:32:12,510
groundwork for future initiatives like

00:32:09,570 --> 00:32:13,860
automatic updates like perhaps a project

00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:15,780
browser built straight into core a

00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:17,400
number of other features that the

00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:21,120
community has been asking for for a long

00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:23,250
time and those are the big highlights if

00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:25,830
there's any questions about the

00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:28,020
drupal.org updates or any of Megan's

00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:31,620
updates please feel free to drop them in

00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:33,270
the chat and I will call them out and

00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:36,800
thank you very much for your time

00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:36,800
Nega don't hand it back to you

00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:42,840
you

00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,980
you

00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:54,789
alright well we had a little challenge

00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:57,159
they're trying to unmute me but thank

00:32:54,789 --> 00:32:59,380
you Tim for that great overview and

00:32:57,159 --> 00:33:03,370
thanks everyone for joining the call and

00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:06,299
we have you know so much appreciation

00:33:03,370 --> 00:33:09,520
for how you support us in so many ways

00:33:06,299 --> 00:33:11,890
especially funding drupal.org and all

00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:14,140
the work that Tim's team does to keep

00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:17,200
the the tool the tools that you use

00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:20,740
current and keep the site up and running

00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:22,120
with a great performance there's a lot

00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:23,980
of information that we shared if you

00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:26,289
have any questions feel free to reach

00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:28,840
out to Tim 9 any time and of course you

00:33:26,289 --> 00:33:33,580
can reach out to your account manager

00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:35,679
Delana or mark we're here for you and we

00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:37,750
look forward to give you more updates

00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:40,600
over the next couple months so have a

00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:42,620
great day and we look forward to talking

00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:43,940
soon

00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:46,370
we've got one quick question that did

00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:49,100
come through this is from this is from

00:33:46,370 --> 00:33:51,020
glo host with the recent changes to with

00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:51,680
github and the page to paterberg slash

00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:54,050
get off

00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:55,730
how will this affect issue credits for

00:33:54,050 --> 00:33:58,400
Drupal developers develop Drupal modules

00:33:55,730 --> 00:34:02,360
on github this was talked about briefly

00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:03,470
on the 2017 q1 supporter web cast that's

00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:06,170
a good question

00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:07,700
so the upcoming changes to tooling which

00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:10,460
the announcement will talk about this

00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:13,120
more will include an integration between

00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:16,370
drupal.org and the tooling provider and

00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:19,070
the current issue credit system will

00:34:16,370 --> 00:34:21,350
still be in place so we're going to do

00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:23,960
multiple phases a first phase

00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:26,360
transparently changing our existing get

00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:28,909
back in the second phase enabling merge

00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:31,850
requests inline editing and web code

00:34:28,909 --> 00:34:33,500
review all that kind of stuff and then

00:34:31,850 --> 00:34:35,320
we'll have sort of that modern toolset

00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:37,250
and we would encourage folks to

00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:40,460
potentially to migrate if they're on the

00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:43,340
other co-hosts but as part of the third

00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:45,409
phase we're considering you know can we

00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:47,179
take anybody who's still at these

00:34:45,409 --> 00:34:50,870
third-party tools and give them a direct

00:34:47,179 --> 00:34:53,060
integration of some sort so it credit

00:34:50,870 --> 00:34:54,649
for third party hosting won't be part of

00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:57,650
the immediate rollout of this next

00:34:54,649 --> 00:34:59,060
tooling change but once it enables us to

00:34:57,650 --> 00:35:02,210
do that it'll be something we're looking

00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:05,000
at as a follow up phase I hope that

00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:11,150
