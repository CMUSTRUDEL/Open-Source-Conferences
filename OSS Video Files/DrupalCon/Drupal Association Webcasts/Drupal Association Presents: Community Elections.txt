opportunity to understand how the

00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:58,079
elections work and help us make the next

00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:01,820
set of elections as successful as they

that's how to reach me so what's our

00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:36,450
agenda today and first we're going to

00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:38,100
talk about what does the drupal

00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:39,570
association board do so we can get a

00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:42,090
clear understanding of what's the role

00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:44,700
of the board in the drupal project and

00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:46,470
the association and then we'll run

00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:50,070
through how nominations and elections

00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:52,740
work sort of mechanically and then we'll

00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:54,720
talk about who's eligible to run and how

00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:57,270
you do that if you're interested in

00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,770
having a seat or you think you know

00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:00,570
someone who might be interested in

00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:03,210
running will give you a lowdown on

00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:06,750
everything they would need to know and

00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:09,170
then what kind of commitment you'd be

00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:12,000
making during the election process

00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:13,920
specifically to have a good candidacy

00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,959
and then we'll talk about

00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,700
the timeline looks like for the 2015

00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:20,690
elections which will be our next

00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:23,610
election so that's our agenda today

00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:28,770
let's pop right into what the

00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:30,330
association board does so in short the

00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:32,100
association board exists to make this

00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:35,700
community as successful as possible

00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:37,920
right so we know that Drupal is a really

00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:40,980
big and flourishing open source project

00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:43,950
it's got over 30,000 active developers

00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:46,140
currently building over a million Drupal

00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:48,510
sites know the true polls been

00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:50,670
incredibly successful especially in the

00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:53,130
enterprise space twelve percent of the

00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:57,090
top 100 thousand websites are run on

00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:59,850
Drupal and it's not just about the big

00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:02,430
stuff lots of folks have made lots of

00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:05,010
little contributions to Drupal along the

00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:08,790
way we've had over 2,000 contributors to

00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:11,569
Drupal 8 so far and when that product

00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:15,350
comes out it will be the most

00:03:11,569 --> 00:03:18,630
contributed to version of Drupal yet so

00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:20,489
we're really excited about the strength

00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:23,250
of the community that's out there the

00:03:20,489 --> 00:03:25,320
fact that it is so big is one indicator

00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:28,650
and the picture here is from drupalcon

00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:34,620
Portland last year the group photo was

00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:36,239
just massive looking already so you know

00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:37,380
they've been that amount of folks that

00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,590
are participating in the Drupal

00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:42,959
community is really really really large

00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:44,459
but the best part is that you guys are

00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,500
contributing in so many different ways

00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:47,880
so we folks for contributing code we

00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:50,160
have folks who are going to camp for

00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:52,650
people who do documentation folks who

00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:55,980
help support the issue cues on

00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:57,540
drupal.org and and really the job of the

00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:59,609
board is to help make all of you

00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:02,040
successful in all the ways that you want

00:03:59,609 --> 00:04:04,260
to contribute and and the reason I say

00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:06,030
that is not just if you know they feel

00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:08,250
good about isn't it great what the board

00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:10,079
does and with the Association sure has

00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:12,660
the support but just to point out that

00:04:10,079 --> 00:04:16,739
that's actually a pretty you know

00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:18,299
mammoth task because when you have so

00:04:16,739 --> 00:04:19,979
many people involved from so many places

00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:22,680
around the world and so many ways that

00:04:19,979 --> 00:04:26,540
they engage in the project that's a lot

00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:30,080
of stakeholders that we try to

00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:31,670
you know try to help keep happy and so

00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,890
it's a lot of work it's a lot of work

00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:37,210
with the board under tapes but it's

00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:37,210
really great stuff that they love doing

00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:42,680
just so you understand a little bit

00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:44,960
about the board the board composition we

00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:46,370
tried to structure the board we they

00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,800
tried to structure the board because I

00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:50,360
wasn't there when it happened so that it

00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,030
could really represent this mammoth

00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:55,190
community in some significant ways so we

00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:57,290
have three classes of directors on the

00:04:55,190 --> 00:05:00,500
board the first is the founding director

00:04:57,290 --> 00:05:03,740
which is treats so every year we real

00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:05,420
extra space founding director seat it's

00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:07,130
possible at some point the future he

00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:09,770
would not fill this seat but know the

00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:12,770
person can fill it so at the point that

00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:14,360
we decided not to you know drew society

00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:15,980
didn't want to be on the Association for

00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:18,410
anymore or something you know we just

00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:19,640
wouldn't fill this seat i'll say i don't

00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:21,410
think that time is coming for a long

00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:23,930
time but there it is we have a founding

00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:25,820
director seat that is grease a seat but

00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:29,660
we do have to reconfirm him every year

00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:31,760
as a board we also have class directors

00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:34,640
these are directors that are recruited

00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:36,890
by the board nominated by a nominating

00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:40,190
committee and then voted on by the full

00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:42,860
board to serve three-year terms so these

00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:45,680
plasters include directors like Denise

00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:48,740
Cooper Jeff Walpole vase upon mu these

00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,720
are class directors and then we have two

00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:53,120
seats on the board that are at large

00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:55,190
directors and those of the seats that

00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,350
we're talking about here today those are

00:05:55,190 --> 00:06:01,460
the folks who are elected by the

00:05:57,350 --> 00:06:05,510
community and we recently switched up

00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:07,340
the bylaws a bit in order to we hope

00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:11,540
create a better experience for at-large

00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:13,130
directors so when the when the board and

00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:14,720
the bylaws were first founded the

00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:18,860
at-large directors were elected to

00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:20,570
one-year terms two at a time and so we'd

00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:22,430
have to member two new members come in

00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:24,200
for a year their term would be over we

00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:26,750
would elect to new members after year

00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:30,250
their term would be over well the thing

00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:34,970
is that it takes a while for a board to

00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:37,970
form a good team and be able to work

00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:39,430
well together and the board is also

00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:42,040
working on

00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:43,600
long term issues so it's really

00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:47,590
difficult for someone's come in out of

00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:49,540
the blue pickup what's going on get a

00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:53,170
sense of who the people are and start to

00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:54,580
have an impact in just a year so we want

00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:56,950
to make the experience better so the

00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:59,410
bylaws were just recently changed so

00:06:56,950 --> 00:07:01,960
that now we elect an at-large director

00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:04,630
to a two-year term and we do those

00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:10,030
elections every year and we liked one

00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:11,950
person each year so currently Matthew

00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:14,020
Saunders who won the last community

00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:15,910
election he's serving a two-year term

00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:18,040
the next election we're going to like

00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:20,680
this another single individual to serve

00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:22,960
a two-year term so they're staggered so

00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:25,570
we always have to community members who

00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:27,580
are elected on the board and they serve

00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:29,740
for two years and a staggered wife so

00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:31,720
hopefully that makes sense those are the

00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:34,930
three types of board seats that we have

00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:36,970
on the board and again we do this

00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:40,690
because we want to make sure that the

00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:42,490
board has a good representation so from

00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:44,020
a nominating perspective this gives us

00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:46,930
the opportunity to make sure that we

00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:49,210
have we can pick for skill sets that the

00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:52,210
organization needs on the board at that

00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:54,370
moment so for example at this point in

00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:55,930
time the association is in a growth mode

00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:59,080
and we have lots of needs around

00:07:55,930 --> 00:08:02,050
marketing and finance to help support an

00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:05,440
org structure to help support the

00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:07,000
changes that we're going through and the

00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,530
nomination process helps us ensure that

00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,990
we have board members that can meet

00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:12,760
those skill sets the at-large directors

00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:14,800
help make sure that there is a good

00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:16,690
community representation as we go

00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:20,200
through as well so that's the board

00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:22,570
composition and the boards you know real

00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:25,480
job is just to uphold the mission of the

00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:27,850
organization and this is the mission

00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:30,160
statement that the board just recently

00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:31,840
revised so I'm debuting it here and

00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:34,300
you'll see it start to roll out shortly

00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:36,420
across the community Drupal powers the

00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:39,670
best of the web the drupal association

00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:43,450
unites a global open source community to

00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:44,440
build and promote Drupal so the board

00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:47,640
supports the mission of the organization

00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:50,980
and what that really looks like is

00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:52,470
there's both some legal obligations and

00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:55,200
then there are some

00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:57,690
some ways that we live up to supporting

00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:00,420
this mission so I'm going to go ahead

00:08:57,690 --> 00:09:03,360
and start with the legal obligations get

00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:05,990
those out of the way so in the united

00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:08,850
states where the association is based

00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:12,510
board members of any nonprofit have

00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:14,850
three legal responsibilities there are

00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:17,550
some others but these are the three that

00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:20,040
broadly define what a board member is

00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:22,710
responsible for and this is what you're

00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:25,380
held accountable to the first is duty of

00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:28,020
care and what that basically means is

00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:30,630
that in your role as board member and

00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:33,360
you are always a board member once

00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:35,610
you're on the board no matter what

00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:37,410
studying you're in your representative

00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:40,530
of the board but in your role as board

00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:44,240
member you make good choices for the

00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:46,740
organization right and you do that by

00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:50,160
reading the materials that are prepared

00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:51,960
for you by asking important questions by

00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:54,660
making sure that you understand the

00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:56,370
needs of the organization you understand

00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:58,770
the information that you have about

00:09:56,370 --> 00:10:02,940
what's going on and that you're voting

00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:05,040
to support the you know the moves that

00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:09,260
will make the organization stronger

00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:12,750
right you also have a duty of loyalty

00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:14,670
which means that when you're in a when

00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:17,190
you are acting on behalf of the board

00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:19,890
you put the organization ahead of your

00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:21,600
own interests and this really comes into

00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:25,470
play for conflict of interest types of

00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:27,300
scenarios is the most obvious scenario

00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:31,170
that where duty of loyalty comes into

00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:34,470
play so for example if we were at the

00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:37,800
Association looking for a contractor to

00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:41,490
make some improvements on Triple org you

00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:43,770
know board members could not say put

00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:46,680
their organizations put me to put their

00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:49,250
companies up to bid and do so in a way

00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:52,170
that would be at the expense of the

00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:53,580
Association so in fact we just try to

00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:55,350
avoid those scenarios all together and

00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:57,480
just don't hire board member companies

00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:59,820
to do things but there's a duty of

00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:02,340
loyalty you would never try to broker a

00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:04,050
deal for a friend's company that comes

00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:05,139
at the expense of the Association that

00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:09,790
sort of thing

00:11:05,139 --> 00:11:12,220
and then duty of obedience so as a board

00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:15,730
member it's your job to make sure that

00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:18,100
the association is in compliance with

00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:20,529
all federal state and local laws so that

00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:25,299
includes things like making sure that

00:11:20,529 --> 00:11:27,279
our taxes are filed right and that if we

00:11:25,299 --> 00:11:29,439
have HR issues you're asking the right

00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:32,529
questions to ensure that we're following

00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:35,109
proper human resources law and treating

00:11:32,529 --> 00:11:36,519
our staff appropriately right so you

00:11:35,109 --> 00:11:38,889
have a duty of obedience to make sure

00:11:36,519 --> 00:11:42,069
that we're in compliance with the law so

00:11:38,889 --> 00:11:44,290
these are the legal duties and they're

00:11:42,069 --> 00:11:46,239
really broad and abroad for a reason and

00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:48,160
that's to make sure if they can cover a

00:11:46,239 --> 00:11:50,859
lot of categories but these are

00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:53,679
important things for board members to

00:11:50,859 --> 00:11:55,949
keep in mind and it's how we hold board

00:11:53,679 --> 00:12:00,249
members accountable they're definitely

00:11:55,949 --> 00:12:03,040
used frequently so here in what would

00:12:00,249 --> 00:12:05,079
happen is if someone had an issue since

00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,309
we're based in Portland Oregon excellent

00:12:05,079 --> 00:12:07,839
community had an issue with the way a

00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:09,759
board member was behaving they could

00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:12,160
take it to the attorney general state of

00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:13,839
Oregon who would investigate and

00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:17,139
understand if there was a breach of any

00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:18,639
of these three duties so we can

00:12:17,139 --> 00:12:21,369
absolutely the board can absolutely be

00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:23,739
held accountable for that those are the

00:12:21,369 --> 00:12:25,720
legal duties but let's talk about the

00:12:23,739 --> 00:12:28,149
real work looks like with the practical

00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:30,879
work on a day-to-day basis what the

00:12:28,149 --> 00:12:33,339
association board does is a number of

00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:36,369
things first oversee our financial

00:12:33,339 --> 00:12:39,639
performance obviously if the association

00:12:36,369 --> 00:12:41,860
is not meeting its financial goals if it

00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:44,529
is routinely spending more money than it

00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:46,329
makes you know we've got a problem

00:12:44,529 --> 00:12:49,269
because the association won't continue

00:12:46,329 --> 00:12:51,179
so there is a pretty big emphasis on

00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:53,860
financial performance at the board level

00:12:51,179 --> 00:12:56,350
ensuring that we understand what our

00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:57,549
numbers are telling us and making sure

00:12:56,350 --> 00:13:00,309
that we're course correcting

00:12:57,549 --> 00:13:01,509
appropriately because you know when the

00:13:00,309 --> 00:13:03,989
money runs out there's no more

00:13:01,509 --> 00:13:06,939
organization so that's a huge part of it

00:13:03,989 --> 00:13:09,160
and we do that in a number of ways the

00:13:06,939 --> 00:13:10,869
first is we have a finance committee the

00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:13,539
finance committee meets monthly and

00:13:10,869 --> 00:13:17,189
reviews financial statements prepared by

00:13:13,539 --> 00:13:18,880
staff asks questions get clarification

00:13:17,189 --> 00:13:21,220
you know makes record

00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:25,990
invasions to us and then the Finance

00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:27,280
Committee once a quarter recommends to

00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:29,410
the board that the financial statements

00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:31,870
be approved so once a quarter the full

00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:34,660
board reviews three months worth of

00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:37,960
financials they can ask additional

00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:39,640
questions and follow-ups etc and if all

00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:41,790
the financials look good to everyone we

00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:45,310
have a vote and those finances are

00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:47,470
approved and at that point you may have

00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:49,990
seen on some of our blog posts etc that

00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:52,420
at that point we then publish the

00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:53,950
financials out to the public but the

00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:55,540
point is the board is signing off on

00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:58,930
those financials on a regular routine

00:13:55,540 --> 00:14:01,570
basis the board is also reviewing our

00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:04,330
tax preparation annually we have to file

00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:06,790
with the United States showing what our

00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:10,390
annual numbers are the board receives a

00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:13,030
report from our accounting firm about

00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:15,000
that signs off on the taxes you know

00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:19,270
votes to accept them and they are filed

00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:21,370
and then additionally because we want to

00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:23,800
be an open and transparent organization

00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:26,080
at the Association we also prepare an

00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:28,870
annual audit and what that means is we

00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:31,810
hire an outside firm to come in and

00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:35,500
review our accounting practices for the

00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:38,200
year and review the financial reports

00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:41,770
for the year and create a report for the

00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:45,030
board and the fan public that represents

00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:47,710
our numbers and also addresses any

00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:50,920
management issues that we might have so

00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:52,810
for example um if they find that we're

00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:55,450
not always collecting receipts for

00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:58,600
credit card statements or if they find

00:14:55,450 --> 00:15:00,250
that we are not properly securing checks

00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:02,230
so we have a security issue where

00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:04,930
someone could you know find in a check

00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:06,130
stock and write fraudulent checks you

00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:08,440
know they would put those sorts of

00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:10,210
things in a letter of management review

00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:12,520
for the board and so that's something

00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:14,470
that the board also overseas as well is

00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:16,300
looking through that audit and working

00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:18,070
with auditor to understand both our

00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:21,100
numbers and our management practices

00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:22,420
around finance so a lot of words about

00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:25,840
high notes but it's a huge part of what

00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:28,120
the board does the the other thing that

00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:30,910
the board does it's equally as important

00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:32,499
is set strategy for the organization and

00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:34,299
what that means

00:15:32,499 --> 00:15:37,509
is they really help set the direction

00:15:34,299 --> 00:15:40,239
that the organization could take so

00:15:37,509 --> 00:15:42,609
every day at the Association we have

00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:45,249
about a hundred roads that we could go

00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:47,429
down to serve the community right so we

00:15:45,249 --> 00:15:51,459
could really spend a lot of resources on

00:15:47,429 --> 00:15:54,009
figuring out how to provide or aggregate

00:15:51,459 --> 00:15:57,599
you know better training resources from

00:15:54,009 --> 00:16:00,279
the community to build more Drupal

00:15:57,599 --> 00:16:02,199
developers out there we could spend a

00:16:00,279 --> 00:16:04,449
ton of time saying we're just going to

00:16:02,199 --> 00:16:07,179
really invest in camps and help camps be

00:16:04,449 --> 00:16:09,759
successful we could invest in drupal org

00:16:07,179 --> 00:16:11,469
and really focus on drupal.org but my

00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:13,389
point is we have lots of choices all the

00:16:11,469 --> 00:16:16,599
time but we don't have the resources to

00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:19,599
do all of it and so the board helps us

00:16:16,599 --> 00:16:21,939
think through where the right places to

00:16:19,599 --> 00:16:25,509
put our resources are at this moment in

00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:26,979
time and for the foreseeable future so

00:16:25,509 --> 00:16:30,099
the board really helps asset strategy

00:16:26,979 --> 00:16:31,719
for the next you know I would say right

00:16:30,099 --> 00:16:33,279
now we're looking basically at two to

00:16:31,719 --> 00:16:36,369
three-year time periods we don't look

00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:38,109
too far out because that's a little bit

00:16:36,369 --> 00:16:40,149
tough especially in technology but we

00:16:38,109 --> 00:16:41,769
try to look out at a two-year 23 your

00:16:40,149 --> 00:16:44,769
time horizon and understand which

00:16:41,769 --> 00:16:47,769
direction to take so that's the second

00:16:44,769 --> 00:16:50,169
board to practical board duty they also

00:16:47,769 --> 00:16:52,929
set and review policies for the

00:16:50,169 --> 00:16:56,139
Association and these are important

00:16:52,929 --> 00:16:58,989
because these governs staff behavior so

00:16:56,139 --> 00:17:00,579
the board every year reviews for example

00:16:58,989 --> 00:17:03,669
our financial policies and procedures

00:17:00,579 --> 00:17:07,720
handbook and this says things like you

00:17:03,669 --> 00:17:10,179
know when when we need a when we need a

00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:11,860
check request for over five thousand

00:17:10,179 --> 00:17:13,419
dollars here are the people that have to

00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:15,159
sign off on that check request before

00:17:13,419 --> 00:17:17,350
the check can be ready those kinds of

00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:19,389
things and again those are all in place

00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:22,329
to make sure that we discourage fraud

00:17:19,389 --> 00:17:24,639
and we encourage you know openness and

00:17:22,329 --> 00:17:26,740
transparency in the organization and the

00:17:24,639 --> 00:17:30,789
board reviews and sets those every year

00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:33,279
along with our Cuban resource policies

00:17:30,789 --> 00:17:35,230
they also check those out every year so

00:17:33,279 --> 00:17:39,220
they're overseeing things like what is

00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:41,169
the vacation policy um you know making

00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:45,400
sure that we have a whistleblower policy

00:17:41,169 --> 00:17:47,140
which is a lot you know ensures that

00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:49,180
folks see something wrong at the

00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:51,100
association a staff member they have

00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:53,410
somewhere to turn and report that with

00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:55,000
that fear of retribution those kinds of

00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:57,400
things are all important things at the

00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,960
board overseas and again those are

00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:03,220
things that the auditors look for as

00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:06,340
well so the board also helps us fund

00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:10,120
raise that's an important part and in

00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:11,800
most boards for nonprofits in the united

00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:13,720
states that means something a little bit

00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:16,770
different a lot of times boards will

00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:19,710
play an active role in reaching out to

00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:22,330
major donor prospects and helping to

00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:25,840
convince them to write big checks for

00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:28,030
their nonprofit right um we don't have

00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:30,160
that kind of fundraising strategy here

00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:32,950
yet that is not a strategy that the

00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:35,950
board has you know wanted to go after at

00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:37,930
this moment but the board does help us

00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:40,530
fund raised in the sense that they do a

00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:44,200
lot of work to reach out to other

00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:46,420
companies Drupal shops ISVs in the field

00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:49,000
you know related web technology services

00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:50,830
firms and help connect those folks to

00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,900
our staff to do things like become a

00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:54,790
drupalcon sponsor or become a supporting

00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:58,180
partner so the board plays an active

00:18:54,790 --> 00:19:01,720
role in fundraising in that way and then

00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:03,190
finally the the last role and there's

00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:05,650
probably some other so bless you all

00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:08,500
talk about for the fourth is managing me

00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:10,840
the executive director so the board is

00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:12,820
in charge of ensuring that I'm

00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:15,190
performing well I'm responsible to the

00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:18,370
board they do my annual performance

00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:21,940
review you know all that sort of thing

00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:23,770
so they are my boss so I invite you all

00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:28,120
to have 12 boxes sometimes it's super

00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:29,860
fun all right those the practical duties

00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:32,230
and I'm just gonna cause they're take a

00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:37,600
sip of tea and just ask Lauren if we

00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:39,470
have any questions to worry about yet no

00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:44,419
questions

00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:45,919
alright ok so what how does the board do

00:19:44,419 --> 00:19:47,270
all this stuff so there are all these

00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:50,710
things are in charge of how do they get

00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:53,510
it all time so here's how we do the work

00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:57,080
board members are expected to attend 10

00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:59,059
of 12 monthly board meetings now most of

00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:03,500
our board meetings are held via

00:19:59,059 --> 00:20:07,669
teleconference so ten meetings a year

00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:10,039
are in fact strictly online um two

00:20:07,669 --> 00:20:12,799
meetings a year happen in conjunction

00:20:10,039 --> 00:20:15,140
with Drupal cons so we do a public board

00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:17,630
meeting at the North American con and at

00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:20,900
the European pond so two meetings are

00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:23,870
actually in person and they are live at

00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:25,520
the drupalcon in those board meetings

00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:27,549
right we've set an agenda ahead of time

00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:31,250
we take care of the business there and

00:20:27,549 --> 00:20:32,780
we have discussions we have two sections

00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:34,640
to those meetings we have a public

00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:36,950
section of the meeting and we have

00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:39,620
executive session so in the public

00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:41,630
section of the meaning we discuss almost

00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:45,830
everything that we might need to discuss

00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:48,169
so for example in the upcoming 20 of

00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:53,120
August webinar and we'll be talking

00:20:48,169 --> 00:20:56,299
about we'll be talking about licensing

00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:58,789
issues on drupal.org and the role of the

00:20:56,299 --> 00:21:00,559
board might need to play in oversight of

00:20:58,789 --> 00:21:03,980
those issues we've got some

00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:06,200
recommendations from the community we

00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:07,820
have had topics in the past like who

00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:09,650
blocked him around we had an open public

00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:11,690
discussion about some actual board

00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:12,919
governance issues like should we change

00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:17,299
some of the ways the committee's work

00:21:12,919 --> 00:21:18,980
etc and so will also get things like

00:21:17,299 --> 00:21:20,419
reports from the latest Drupal Collins

00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:22,880
those sorts of things happen especially

00:21:20,419 --> 00:21:25,190
happen in the public meetings an

00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,780
executive session we basically have two

00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:29,000
topics that need to get covered in

00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:31,100
executive session the first is

00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,350
discussion of financials before they're

00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:35,600
published so if we're doing that

00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:37,850
approval of the quarterly financials we

00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:40,070
do that in executive session once the

00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:41,720
financials are approved and published

00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:44,030
then we can talk about them in a public

00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:45,559
forum the other thing that we have to

00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:48,260
talk about my executive session is

00:21:45,559 --> 00:21:49,970
anything related to human resources so

00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:52,169
if the organization is having any

00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:54,929
staffing issues

00:21:52,169 --> 00:21:58,559
etc we talk about those in executive

00:21:54,929 --> 00:22:01,039
session that's just more that's the

00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:04,409
appropriate and legal thing to do so

00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:07,830
public board meetings we also have three

00:22:04,409 --> 00:22:09,690
board strategy and planning retreats and

00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:12,149
I'll say the board always laughs when we

00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:14,129
say retreat because usually we're locked

00:22:12,149 --> 00:22:18,359
in a windowless conference room for two

00:22:14,129 --> 00:22:20,519
days and it's Hotel food that's never

00:22:18,359 --> 00:22:23,190
very good so it feels like anything but

00:22:20,519 --> 00:22:25,700
a retreat uh-huh but what we do is we

00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:27,840
take a couple of days three times a year

00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:30,989
again we usually do this in conjunction

00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:33,179
to drupal cons so we'll do the weekend

00:22:30,989 --> 00:22:35,460
before drupalcon North America the

00:22:33,179 --> 00:22:37,289
weekend before drupalcon Europe we

00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:40,859
usually meet in january or early

00:22:37,289 --> 00:22:43,619
februari as well and we take a couple of

00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:46,200
days to look at those longer-term issues

00:22:43,619 --> 00:22:48,269
that are hard to get at in a you know

00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:50,730
one hour to 90 minute public board

00:22:48,269 --> 00:22:54,499
meeting and this is where we can talk

00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:57,649
about things like establishing a set of

00:22:54,499 --> 00:23:01,470
published values for the association or

00:22:57,649 --> 00:23:04,019
what is the will go really in depth with

00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:07,739
a proposed leadership plan and budget

00:23:04,019 --> 00:23:09,269
for the upcoming year so those those

00:23:07,739 --> 00:23:11,879
meetings are really about you know

00:23:09,269 --> 00:23:14,929
letting us dig deep into some issues as

00:23:11,879 --> 00:23:17,609
well Polly so that I do that that work

00:23:14,929 --> 00:23:20,190
we also ask for members to contribute to

00:23:17,609 --> 00:23:23,039
at least one board committee we have a

00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:24,480
few subcommittees that do some work like

00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:25,859
the Finance Committee which I explained

00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:27,269
to you we also have a governance

00:23:25,859 --> 00:23:31,739
committee which is in charge of

00:23:27,269 --> 00:23:33,239
nominating folks to the board etc and we

00:23:31,739 --> 00:23:36,570
expect that you'll probably spend about

00:23:33,239 --> 00:23:38,879
five hours or more for months if you're

00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:40,950
doing the work of a board member just to

00:23:38,879 --> 00:23:42,480
review meeting materials etc and

00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:44,369
obviously when we have a retreat it's

00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:46,200
more than five hours but in an average

00:23:44,369 --> 00:23:49,129
month you're spending about five hours

00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:51,419
to review the materials beat the meeting

00:23:49,129 --> 00:23:53,070
participate in the board discussions

00:23:51,419 --> 00:23:56,879
that might be happening on the list in

00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:57,869
between meetings etc all you have sorry

00:23:56,879 --> 00:24:00,239
to interrupt you we have a question

00:23:57,869 --> 00:24:01,859
really quick regarding the committee's

00:24:00,239 --> 00:24:04,320
at what are the other committees that we

00:24:01,859 --> 00:24:06,090
have okay let's see if I can remember

00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:09,720
them so we have finance

00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:12,539
um we have governance we have a revenue

00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:14,340
committee the revenue committee at

00:24:12,539 --> 00:24:16,559
revenue and membership committee and

00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:19,080
their work is to advise our associate

00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:23,190
director Megan sanic 'i who oversees all

00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:26,279
of our revenue programs on how to advise

00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:28,470
her on new opportunities for revenue and

00:24:26,279 --> 00:24:30,929
provide advice for existing programs

00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:33,270
that you know may need help one way or

00:24:30,929 --> 00:24:35,130
the other and the reason we have that

00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:38,159
revenue committee is that one of the

00:24:35,130 --> 00:24:40,890
mandates from the board is to diversify

00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:44,460
our revenue streams so that we are not

00:24:40,890 --> 00:24:46,559
as dependent on drupalcon revenue to

00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:48,590
fund the rest of the organization so

00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:52,710
that's a big focus for us right now

00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:55,169
sweep that committee um there is also a

00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:58,230
conflict of interest committee and that

00:24:55,169 --> 00:25:00,570
committee only convenes when there is an

00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:02,789
issue to address so if someone believes

00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:04,500
there has been a conflict of interest we

00:25:02,789 --> 00:25:08,220
would pull that committee together in

00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:14,880
order to you know investigate the issue

00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:19,370
and resolve have a few we have a few

00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:23,190
board committee board members as well

00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:25,049
those include the drupal.org working

00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:27,830
groups so the content working group the

00:25:25,049 --> 00:25:30,000
infrastructure working group and the

00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:32,610
software working group those are all

00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:35,220
board committees and then the marketing

00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:37,620
committee is a community committee but

00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:39,510
the board appoints a chair so that

00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:41,760
committee also reports up to the board

00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:43,890
and then from time to time we'll have

00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:47,190
some ad hoc committees that we pulled

00:25:43,890 --> 00:25:50,730
together so for example we had a we had

00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:53,429
a recruiting committee for the CTO

00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:56,100
position that came together at the end

00:25:53,429 --> 00:25:59,880
of last year to help manage that process

00:25:56,100 --> 00:26:02,570
with me and that consisted of both board

00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:06,720
members and advisory board members and

00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:08,940
they did a really fantastic job so those

00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:10,890
are the ones that exist but again we can

00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:13,909
also pull together ad hoc committees at

00:26:10,890 --> 00:26:18,620
at any time you know based on the means

00:26:13,909 --> 00:26:22,770
great thank you yeah I thorne

00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:24,660
okay so that's the work so you'll be

00:26:22,770 --> 00:26:26,310
busy as a board member so how do the

00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:29,130
nominations and elections process works

00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:33,000
um so I put a link in here there's a

00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:35,580
good historical sort of blog post that

00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:37,790
outlines somehow elections all that

00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:40,200
started I think it was authored by mega

00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:41,880
we did a ton of work on the advisory

00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:44,670
board to help get the first elections

00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:46,740
going maybe key and Angie did an amazing

00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:48,360
job of leading the community through the

00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:50,820
process of getting to their first

00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:53,940
community election which we started

00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:55,350
talking about in 2011 so that's right

00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:58,620
around the time that the association was

00:26:55,350 --> 00:27:01,170
coming together as a legal organization

00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:04,710
here in the United States and there was

00:27:01,170 --> 00:27:06,330
a ton of discussion back then about you

00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:09,180
know how many folks were we going to

00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:11,370
elect and who would be eligible to vote

00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:13,800
in elections and what kind of voting

00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:15,480
process would we use all those things

00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:18,090
were covered by the community and there

00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:21,140
was a lot of amazing discussion which

00:27:18,090 --> 00:27:23,970
led to the first election in 2012 and

00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:27,930
then as I mentioned we just revised the

00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:30,090
bylaws in 2014 to change that process a

00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:33,020
little bit so now we're elective one

00:27:30,090 --> 00:27:37,290
person per year to a two-year term I

00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:39,270
should also just mention that um we use

00:27:37,290 --> 00:27:41,490
the election module to handle

00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:44,280
nominations and voting so if you're if

00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:45,870
you want to look into the software that

00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:47,810
you know runs the whole thing this is

00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:51,150
the module to go check out as election

00:27:47,810 --> 00:27:54,180
that's what we set up and use on our

00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:56,250
Drupal 7 site and so we use that last

00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:59,010
year we'll be using that again in the

00:27:56,250 --> 00:28:00,360
next election prior to that we use

00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:03,120
something different because we're on

00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:06,750
Drupal 6 but since the upgrade to Drupal

00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:09,450
7 is the election module so how does it

00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:12,080
work if you are interested in running

00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:14,670
for a seat candidates can self nominate

00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:16,440
we create a forum in the elections

00:28:14,670 --> 00:28:20,100
module which is up on the association

00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:23,610
site you cannot nominate someone else so

00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:25,680
you do need to self nominate um but we

00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:27,330
do open that up for a short published

00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:28,770
period of time it's usually a couple of

00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:31,350
weeks and we ask you for some

00:28:28,770 --> 00:28:33,929
information we want to know I

00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:36,900
you know a basic vial from you I want to

00:28:33,929 --> 00:28:38,490
know why you're interested in running we

00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:41,400
also want to know what relevant

00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:43,289
experience you might have that that that

00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:44,460
makes you a good candidate and then

00:28:43,289 --> 00:28:47,789
we're going to ask you for contact

00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:49,080
information at a photo as well and so

00:28:47,789 --> 00:28:50,940
you provide all of that information

00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:56,309
through that form on the elections

00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:59,640
module and the voting is also run

00:28:56,309 --> 00:29:02,850
through the elections module and we use

00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:04,890
Instant Runoff voting or the IRB process

00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:08,220
and this is something that's pretty

00:29:04,890 --> 00:29:10,950
foreign to folks in the US but it's much

00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:14,159
more commonly understood in Australia

00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:16,200
and Europe but what we ask folks to do

00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:18,390
instead of just voting for their single

00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:21,270
favorite candidate the voter will

00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:23,490
actually rank the candidates so if there

00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:26,760
are eight candidates they will rank them

00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:31,230
one through eight and what this allows

00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:33,929
us to do then is use special masks to

00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:35,880
figure out you know who had the

00:29:33,929 --> 00:29:38,789
strongest sentiment from the from the

00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:41,610
voting population overall and what this

00:29:38,789 --> 00:29:43,590
keeps from happening is gives a small

00:29:41,610 --> 00:29:46,080
majority from winning representation so

00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:49,200
with with eight candidates if you're

00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:51,270
just using majority rules voting it's

00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,980
possible for a candidate to win with

00:29:51,270 --> 00:29:56,400
something like thirty thirty-five

00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:59,070
percent of the vote and Instant Runoff

00:29:56,400 --> 00:30:02,039
voting helps alleviate that I would

00:29:59,070 --> 00:30:03,570
definitely if you're interested in more

00:30:02,039 --> 00:30:05,309
about how that actually works and what

00:30:03,570 --> 00:30:07,710
it looks like if you google it there's

00:30:05,309 --> 00:30:10,590
some great Wikipedia entries but also in

00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:12,990
that last URL i would say on the last

00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:15,150
slide I think there's a link to a couple

00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:18,450
of videos that do a great job explaining

00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:19,890
Instant Runoff voting and again we

00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:22,049
really do that because we want to make

00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:25,770
sure that this isn't just a majority

00:30:22,049 --> 00:30:28,650
votes kind of thing so if that's the

00:30:25,770 --> 00:30:30,990
process we went with we keep voting open

00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:33,059
for about a week so people can only vote

00:30:30,990 --> 00:30:36,630
once but they can vote any time during

00:30:33,059 --> 00:30:39,000
that week and then who's eligible to

00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:41,940
vote is anyone who has a drupal.org

00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:44,309
account who is logged in in the last

00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:45,190
year and who had that account before

00:30:44,309 --> 00:30:49,450
nominations

00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:51,460
open so we do a we do put a restriction

00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:53,830
on that module so the only folks who can

00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:55,570
come vote have had that account you know

00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:58,540
how to count before nominations opened

00:30:55,570 --> 00:31:00,040
and have logged in in the last year so

00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:03,640
those folks are all authorized to go

00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:05,620
vote and again sort of the Instant

00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:06,730
Runoff decision the voter eligibility

00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:09,790
these were all things that were

00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:12,340
discussed by the community in 2011 and

00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:15,130
we use this system for the last few

00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:18,520
elections I have a question really quick

00:31:15,130 --> 00:31:20,950
Holly yeah do you need to come up with

00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:23,620
travel costs for yourself or is it

00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:27,100
provided for the couple of meetings that

00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:29,320
are at the true pecans gotcha yeah so it

00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:31,120
can be expensive to get around to the

00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:33,700
drupalcon meetings we totally understand

00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:35,440
that and so we do ask in the board

00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:37,240
agreement that if it's possible for you

00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:39,040
to pay your own way that you do and

00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:40,660
that's one way that you can help give

00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:43,000
back to the organization as a board

00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:46,390
member is by you know we don't have to

00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:49,450
incur those costs however we do not want

00:31:46,390 --> 00:31:53,200
those costs to be a reason why someone

00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:54,550
could not participate so um if if that's

00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:56,650
not possible if you can't pay your own

00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:59,710
way we absolutely do pay for board

00:31:56,650 --> 00:32:03,900
members to be at those meetings and a

00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:06,220
really quick comment from our audience

00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:08,050
people don't have to rank all of the

00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:10,450
candidates they can leave some blank is

00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:11,980
that accurate not actually is true

00:32:10,450 --> 00:32:13,660
you're right if we have eight candidates

00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:15,520
you don't have to rank all eight you can

00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:16,690
you can decide that you only know four

00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:18,550
of them and you're going to rank those

00:32:16,690 --> 00:32:20,740
four and leave the other flank great

00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:25,450
thank you for the clarification yeah you

00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:28,930
bet okay so how do I run or who can run

00:32:25,450 --> 00:32:31,500
um so who can run anyone about the

00:32:28,930 --> 00:32:34,210
liberal community can run for board seat

00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:36,430
but I will say your transition to board

00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:39,280
service will be a lot easier if you've

00:32:36,430 --> 00:32:42,840
had some experience under your belt I

00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:44,800
think that serving on a board can be

00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:46,540
it's hard to know what you're walking

00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:48,820
into it's one of those situations where

00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:49,960
you don't know what you don't know but

00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:52,920
there are a few things that can make

00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:55,480
that a little bit easier for you so um

00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:56,530
just to say again that the Association

00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:58,200
forward although the drupal association

00:32:56,530 --> 00:32:59,940
itself is still a relative

00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:01,770
please small nonprofit and you've got a

00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:03,960
budget around five million dollars about

00:33:01,770 --> 00:33:06,540
20-some staff right still pretty small

00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:08,820
organization but the scope is really big

00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:11,580
in terms of how international we are and

00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:15,300
the kinds of issues that we have to deal

00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:19,320
with are far exceed I think the typical

00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:21,150
nonprofit that is of our size so it can

00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:23,850
be really helpful if you have had some

00:33:21,150 --> 00:33:26,880
other board experience in your community

00:33:23,850 --> 00:33:28,710
it could be a school board you know

00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:30,540
various arts organization in your

00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:32,190
community anything where you've served

00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:34,020
on a committee or been on that board I

00:33:32,190 --> 00:33:35,520
think it's just really sets you set you

00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:37,530
up to have the right set of expectations

00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:40,200
about what's going to happen and where

00:33:37,530 --> 00:33:42,810
you can contribute but it's definitely

00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:44,640
not a requirement here are some other

00:33:42,810 --> 00:33:47,010
things that aren't bored experience that

00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:49,500
can also be really helpful in helping

00:33:47,010 --> 00:33:51,960
you you know transition into board

00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:54,030
service really well so obviously reading

00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:58,590
financial documents like I said we look

00:33:54,030 --> 00:34:02,340
at financials a lot on the board so if

00:33:58,590 --> 00:34:04,860
you have helped prepare budgets um if

00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:07,110
you know what an income statement is

00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:10,500
what a balance sheet is the cash flow

00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:12,330
statement is cash flow projections those

00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:14,580
sorts of things are really really

00:34:12,330 --> 00:34:16,530
helpful and they help you be immediately

00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:18,270
useful to the board it's a great way to

00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:20,790
sort of latch onto something and be

00:34:18,270 --> 00:34:22,980
really useful if you don't have the

00:34:20,790 --> 00:34:25,020
experience with that there are tons and

00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:27,600
tons of resources out there that can

00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:29,730
explain what those basic financial

00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:31,560
statements are and how to read them and

00:34:29,730 --> 00:34:34,050
what they mean and how they work

00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:36,990
together i think is usually the tricky

00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:38,730
part because the income statement paid

00:34:36,990 --> 00:34:40,170
you know paints one picture the balance

00:34:38,730 --> 00:34:42,300
sheet another at the cash flow yet

00:34:40,170 --> 00:34:44,460
another the three together gave you that

00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:46,260
you know fully dimensional understanding

00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:47,910
of what's going on in the org so there's

00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:49,290
a lot of resources that you can find out

00:34:47,910 --> 00:34:51,480
there that will actually help you I

00:34:49,290 --> 00:34:54,750
think understand this understand

00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:57,300
financial documents and prepare you for

00:34:54,750 --> 00:34:59,460
this um obviously triple community

00:34:57,300 --> 00:35:02,190
experience is really important and very

00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:03,990
very helpful because you understand then

00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:07,380
where you're you know our constituencies

00:35:03,990 --> 00:35:10,020
are coming from and that is I think to

00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:11,940
find really really broadly UM community

00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:13,800
experience can be code contribution

00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:18,060
but it can also be you know forum

00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:20,160
moderation um so we don't you know I

00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:23,280
don't think that there's any kind of

00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:26,190
experience that is preferred but that

00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:29,130
strong community experience is very

00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:30,900
useful um you know it's wonderful to

00:35:29,130 --> 00:35:33,750
bring that perspective to your board

00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:36,359
service and it's also really helpful to

00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:37,890
during the election process if you've

00:35:36,359 --> 00:35:40,380
been you know deeply embedded in a

00:35:37,890 --> 00:35:41,490
community doing work those folks can

00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:44,940
really help you in the election process

00:35:41,490 --> 00:35:48,050
as well strategic planning is another

00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:51,569
thing that's very helpful the board is

00:35:48,050 --> 00:35:53,880
increasingly less and less tactical but

00:35:51,569 --> 00:35:57,690
increasingly less that was not very good

00:35:53,880 --> 00:36:00,510
sentence structure but the board is

00:35:57,690 --> 00:36:02,849
focused more and more on a big picture

00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:06,180
for the drupal association and not on

00:36:02,849 --> 00:36:10,500
the tactics so we don't spend a ton of

00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:11,910
time talking about say you know how

00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:14,700
we're going to lay out the exhibit hall

00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:16,770
but we do talk about at the dribble cons

00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:18,540
but we do talk about what is the

00:36:16,770 --> 00:36:20,220
changing nature of the Drupal business

00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:24,150
world and what might that mean for the

00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:27,569
exhibit hall right so if you have had

00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:29,430
experience in an organization or in a

00:36:27,569 --> 00:36:31,560
community thinking about those bigger

00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:33,180
picture issues that can be really

00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:35,579
helpful because that's the level that we

00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:37,440
operate at right and then policy

00:36:35,579 --> 00:36:39,450
development that's really really helpful

00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:41,550
and it's another very tangible way like

00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:43,770
if you've helped set HR policies or

00:36:41,550 --> 00:36:45,359
finance policies that's another really

00:36:43,770 --> 00:36:47,069
tangible contribution that could be made

00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:48,900
at the board and and really helped you

00:36:47,069 --> 00:36:51,270
find you know an easy win as a board

00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:53,670
member so that kind of experience you

00:36:51,270 --> 00:36:55,260
know is really useful on it I wouldn't

00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:56,940
say you need all that experience at all

00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:58,800
but if you have experience in any of

00:36:56,940 --> 00:37:00,869
these areas and you can definitely get

00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:05,099
it between now and then it really helps

00:37:00,869 --> 00:37:06,599
make that transition much easier so how

00:37:05,099 --> 00:37:10,349
do you run again you just nominate

00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:12,569
yourself um you fill out the form and

00:37:10,349 --> 00:37:13,859
what happens it's published at the end

00:37:12,569 --> 00:37:15,359
of the nomination period to take all the

00:37:13,859 --> 00:37:17,040
folks who nominate themselves and we

00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:20,160
publish all the candidates out on the

00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:22,530
site so what do you need to do is a

00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:24,790
candidate this is what it looks like

00:37:22,530 --> 00:37:28,930
once we publish that

00:37:24,790 --> 00:37:32,110
you're your candidate forum on the site

00:37:28,930 --> 00:37:36,310
so this is calvin who ran in our last

00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:38,080
election i probably should have may be

00:37:36,310 --> 00:37:40,300
blotted out his email address but it was

00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:42,210
public for a while anyway but this is

00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:44,920
what this is what the elections from

00:37:42,210 --> 00:37:47,710
candidate screening for in the elections

00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:48,610
module looked like last year I'm sure

00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:50,050
we're going to be doing a little more

00:37:48,610 --> 00:37:52,330
styling this year so things look a

00:37:50,050 --> 00:37:55,510
little prettier but what happens is your

00:37:52,330 --> 00:37:58,030
candidate profiles published see here's

00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:58,870
you know counts picture his bio why he's

00:37:58,030 --> 00:38:00,730
interested in running what his

00:37:58,870 --> 00:38:02,980
experience has been and then there's a

00:38:00,730 --> 00:38:04,420
section for comments and what you need

00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:06,100
to do is a candidate is keep an eye on

00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:07,930
this candidate page because what's going

00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:10,870
to happen is that folks are going to ask

00:38:07,930 --> 00:38:12,040
you questions on your candidate page

00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:13,300
they're going to fun want to know you

00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:15,820
know what are you what's the special

00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:17,320
focus you bring to the DA board one of

00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:19,750
the biggest challenges for the drupal

00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:21,790
association those kinds of things and

00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:23,320
you're going to want to answer those so

00:38:21,790 --> 00:38:26,080
you're going to answer questions on your

00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:29,320
candidate profile page but we are also

00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:32,680
during this period going to have some

00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:36,640
meet the candidates webcasts so we will

00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:38,890
do some scenarios just like this where

00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:41,710
we have several candidates on the line

00:38:38,890 --> 00:38:43,390
and we'll schedule a number of these

00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:45,040
meet the candidate sessions that we can

00:38:43,390 --> 00:38:48,160
accommodate all of the candidates in a

00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:50,380
variety of time zones and anyone can

00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:52,780
join and ask questions of the candidates

00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:54,850
live you get a chance to respond with

00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:56,680
your own voice which is great and we

00:38:54,850 --> 00:38:58,900
record those and put those online as

00:38:56,680 --> 00:39:00,820
well so that anyone who's not able to

00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:03,190
attend those sessions lot can listen in

00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:06,100
to them as well and then of course

00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:07,930
during this period this period as well

00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:10,360
you know you're really free to promote

00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:12,430
your candidacy so you know use your

00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:14,170
social media channels reach out to folks

00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:16,470
let them know you're running and why do

00:39:14,170 --> 00:39:19,000
some electioneering that's totally loud

00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:20,410
and in fact it's great because we want

00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,090
to let as many people as possible know

00:39:20,410 --> 00:39:25,030
that elections are happening and really

00:39:22,090 --> 00:39:28,690
get them to vote so that's what you do

00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:32,350
as a candidate um and this is what the

00:39:28,690 --> 00:39:35,290
timeline will look like so we used to do

00:39:32,350 --> 00:39:38,280
elections in the fall and what that

00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:42,670
meant was that we were really doing the

00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:45,910
and and the meet the candidates process

00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:48,220
in August which is a tough time

00:39:45,910 --> 00:39:50,170
especially in Europe lots of vacations

00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:52,600
going on and it was really tough to get

00:39:50,170 --> 00:39:54,670
community participation and what we

00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:57,490
really wanted to do was realign the

00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:59,920
elections with the meeting cycle of the

00:39:57,490 --> 00:40:02,850
board and ensure that we were elected

00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:06,670
candidates so that they could get to

00:40:02,850 --> 00:40:09,940
they could get to a big in person board

00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:12,250
meeting right away because it's a really

00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:14,220
great way to start your board service is

00:40:12,250 --> 00:40:16,570
by you know meeting the board

00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:17,950
face-to-face and experiencing one of

00:40:16,570 --> 00:40:21,490
those big couple day meetings together

00:40:17,950 --> 00:40:25,090
the really good kickoff so we move the

00:40:21,490 --> 00:40:28,150
elections from the fall into the next

00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:32,250
calendar year which means that we'll be

00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:34,900
doing nominations in February of 2015

00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:37,750
will do to meet the candidate section

00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:42,250
from late februari into early March and

00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:44,920
then we'll vote in March and ratify at

00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:47,230
the end of March and that will give us

00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:51,370
enough time to know who the winner is

00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:54,040
and make that public and get them all

00:40:51,370 --> 00:40:56,620
their travel arrangements set up for

00:40:54,040 --> 00:41:00,670
drupal con los angeles and get them to

00:40:56,620 --> 00:41:03,820
that first you know big two-day retreat

00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:06,040
so they have a really good kickoff and

00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:10,470
strong you know entry into their board

00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:13,210
service so that's our process overview

00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:17,220
the time run how it's going to happen I

00:41:13,210 --> 00:41:24,130
have a couple questions really quickly

00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:28,240
um are we allowed to propose a name

00:41:24,130 --> 00:41:30,880
until februari first like would a would

00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:36,310
someone be able to be self nominating

00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:39,850
themselves until that date or what is

00:41:36,310 --> 00:41:42,130
the combinations until februari right so

00:41:39,850 --> 00:41:45,010
woman what would be the cutoff for

00:41:42,130 --> 00:41:48,460
nominations I was wanting effort your

00:41:45,010 --> 00:41:49,870
20th yes okay great thank you we've got

00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:51,130
a nice broad window there are three

00:41:49,870 --> 00:41:57,070
weeks to get nominations

00:41:51,130 --> 00:41:59,140
and and i will say that um the the

00:41:57,070 --> 00:42:00,730
Governance Committee of which we have a

00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:02,800
couple of folks who work on elections as

00:42:00,730 --> 00:42:04,660
a subset of that you know that we've got

00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:06,730
a couple of goals for elections this

00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:10,030
year that we really want the community's

00:42:06,730 --> 00:42:13,150
help with um the first is we really want

00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:18,280
to encourage a very diverse set of

00:42:13,150 --> 00:42:22,360
candidates so um we had in the last

00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:26,020
election maybe one or two female

00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:28,480
candidates out of the bunch you know

00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:30,820
we'd like to see that increase as well

00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:32,560
as geographical diversity candidates

00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:33,820
were largely from the US so we want to

00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:37,510
make sure candidates are from all over

00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:39,130
the world so we really want to focus on

00:42:37,510 --> 00:42:40,420
diversity so if you're here it's because

00:42:39,130 --> 00:42:41,800
you're really interested in this and I

00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:44,380
hope you're really interested in running

00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:46,150
but I also hope that you will think

00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:48,970
about your colleagues who would make

00:42:46,150 --> 00:42:52,210
great candidates as well and reach out

00:42:48,970 --> 00:42:55,270
to them and let them know about this so

00:42:52,210 --> 00:42:58,180
that we can really improve the diversity

00:42:55,270 --> 00:42:59,860
of candidates you know this time around

00:42:58,180 --> 00:43:01,210
and hopefully because we've got a nice

00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:03,730
long lead time and we're talking about

00:43:01,210 --> 00:43:05,800
it now we can do that the other goal

00:43:03,730 --> 00:43:08,260
that the elections folks have for this

00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:10,780
year is to increase the participation in

00:43:08,260 --> 00:43:13,840
voting so over the last couple of years

00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:16,030
when we hold elections the number of

00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:18,670
people who are eligible vote who

00:43:16,030 --> 00:43:22,540
actually do is very small I think it's

00:43:18,670 --> 00:43:24,940
like two or three percent so we you know

00:43:22,540 --> 00:43:27,970
we're not expecting 75% voter turnout

00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:29,890
because you know logging into your

00:43:27,970 --> 00:43:32,560
drupal.org account once during the last

00:43:29,890 --> 00:43:34,750
year is not exactly you know a huge sign

00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:36,700
that you are extremely active in the

00:43:34,750 --> 00:43:40,000
triple community but we would like to

00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:41,440
really see that increase and so you know

00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,870
if you're thinking about cam and see

00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:45,910
again just you know really helping folks

00:43:43,870 --> 00:43:47,890
understand why this is important and why

00:43:45,910 --> 00:43:49,510
they should take a minute to understand

00:43:47,890 --> 00:43:50,860
who the candidates are and make an

00:43:49,510 --> 00:43:55,750
informed choice is really important to

00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:57,520
us as well and did you have another one

00:43:55,750 --> 00:44:01,120
Lauren I'm sorry i went i can understand

00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:02,860
no no no that's fine someone made a

00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:04,849
comment that there was a presentation

00:44:02,860 --> 00:44:08,630
from the drupal association about freak

00:44:04,849 --> 00:44:11,900
fying community candidates and is this

00:44:08,630 --> 00:44:14,599
currently in in process and would that

00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:17,059
cause a reduction of diversity gotcha

00:44:14,599 --> 00:44:18,499
yeah so at the last board meeting we did

00:44:17,059 --> 00:44:20,059
have an open discussion about some

00:44:18,499 --> 00:44:21,700
government its governance issues like

00:44:20,059 --> 00:44:24,769
like I mentioned and if you go to

00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:27,109
Association dr. Borg and check out the

00:44:24,769 --> 00:44:29,779
board section you can get the recording

00:44:27,109 --> 00:44:31,970
in the minutes from the last meeting so

00:44:29,779 --> 00:44:34,130
you can review that if you want um we

00:44:31,970 --> 00:44:39,200
the Governance Committee had met in

00:44:34,130 --> 00:44:41,420
triple con often and you know we're the

00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:44,569
discussion really centered on ways that

00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:47,450
we could ensure that especially the

00:44:44,569 --> 00:44:50,119
folks who are elected again have a

00:44:47,450 --> 00:44:53,779
smoother transition into a board role

00:44:50,119 --> 00:44:57,099
and one of the ideas that have been

00:44:53,779 --> 00:44:59,569
discussed with somehow you know if

00:44:57,099 --> 00:45:02,239
possibly requiring they serve on a

00:44:59,569 --> 00:45:04,039
committee of some sort you know just

00:45:02,239 --> 00:45:06,440
ways to basically pre qualified

00:45:04,039 --> 00:45:07,700
candidates like you know ensure that

00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:10,969
they've had some sort of relevant

00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:12,650
experience and the discussion that the

00:45:10,969 --> 00:45:15,559
board ended up having was that that

00:45:12,650 --> 00:45:22,430
would really significantly decrease the

00:45:15,559 --> 00:45:24,950
number of folks who s and themselves and

00:45:22,430 --> 00:45:28,999
so um I don't think that that's a place

00:45:24,950 --> 00:45:30,529
where we're gonna see action taken but

00:45:28,999 --> 00:45:32,390
that discussion was really interesting

00:45:30,529 --> 00:45:33,890
and the Governance Committee is circling

00:45:32,390 --> 00:45:36,049
back to sort of understand all the

00:45:33,890 --> 00:45:38,359
feedback from that discussion which had

00:45:36,049 --> 00:45:39,890
several other issues in it as well to

00:45:38,359 --> 00:45:41,749
figure out what sort of recommendations

00:45:39,890 --> 00:45:45,049
they might make to the board to to vote

00:45:41,749 --> 00:45:46,670
on but again like I think that it's

00:45:45,049 --> 00:45:49,369
important to know that the impetus there

00:45:46,670 --> 00:45:51,319
is really trying to set these community

00:45:49,369 --> 00:45:54,319
elected candidates up for success on the

00:45:51,319 --> 00:45:58,160
board because it can be it's really

00:45:54,319 --> 00:46:00,859
different to go from you know working to

00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:02,690
organize a camp in your local area where

00:46:00,859 --> 00:46:05,989
you're really focused on things like you

00:46:02,690 --> 00:46:08,900
know got it one of the stickers and or

00:46:05,989 --> 00:46:11,329
the food and where do we put the

00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:13,130
tablecloth of the venue you know to

00:46:11,329 --> 00:46:14,930
working at the Association which it's

00:46:13,130 --> 00:46:16,849
much less tactical much more strategic

00:46:14,930 --> 00:46:18,410
and we just really want to make sure

00:46:16,849 --> 00:46:21,549
that people are set up for six

00:46:18,410 --> 00:46:27,230
doesn't have good expectations there

00:46:21,549 --> 00:46:29,089
great thank you so much yeah so I think

00:46:27,230 --> 00:46:31,369
that was it for me again that's all my

00:46:29,089 --> 00:46:34,160
contact information I'm really happy to

00:46:31,369 --> 00:46:36,170
answer any questions that you might have

00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:38,380
or refer you to the Governance Committee

00:46:36,170 --> 00:46:41,119
who can answer questions as well but

00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:42,559
that's a that's all the information I

00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:44,869
had so if you have any other questions

00:46:42,559 --> 00:46:46,700
about the process I mean you can take a

00:46:44,869 --> 00:46:50,150
couple minutes for you to put them in as

00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:52,160
well but um again it's not stress that

00:46:50,150 --> 00:46:54,109
we really want to get out ahead of the

00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:57,200
selection and make sure that folks know

00:46:54,109 --> 00:46:59,240
about it and anything you can do to help

00:46:57,200 --> 00:47:00,530
share that would be great so I know

00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:03,289
