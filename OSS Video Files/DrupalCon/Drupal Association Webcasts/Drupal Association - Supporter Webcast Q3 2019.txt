00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:35,850
with not only a good business background

00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:38,160
but he's done a lot of work in the

00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:40,200
community around associations and camps

00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:42,690
and that's a huge initiative that we

00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:44,190
want to be better supporting as we move

00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:46,410
forward and so from a strategic

00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:48,840
standpoint he's gonna bring some good

00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:52,400
advice to us as we look at how the DA

00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:55,950
can support those initiatives as well

00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:58,650
loli is here in Atlanta with me she's

00:02:55,950 --> 00:03:00,600
with Equifax I've known her over the

00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:03,060
years for her advocacy with Women in

00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:05,700
Technology but she's also got really

00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:07,500
good experience in content management

00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:09,440
and brand promotion it's talked about

00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:11,880
the things that we mentioned in the

00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,890
webcast which was around getting outside

00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:15,570
the Drupal bubble helping other people

00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:17,760
know what we do and spreading the word

00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:19,230
she's going to have really good input on

00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,030
how we can do that effectively in

00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:24,959
particular with enterprise large

00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:27,060
end-users and Ryan if you don't know

00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:29,130
Ryan you should get to know Ryan not

00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:29,760
only is he a longtime community member

00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:32,100
as well

00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,570
you may recognize that he has served on

00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:35,820
the board before so he's been a

00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:38,370
community elected board member that has

00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:40,860
been reelected to the board outside of

00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:44,220
the community spot which went to Leslie

00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:47,310
and Ryan has agency experience a lot of

00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:48,870
Drupal experience and is very

00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:50,370
knowledgeable and a lot of things and so

00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:52,829
we're glad that Ryan's gonna stay on

00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:56,220
with us and again if you haven't met any

00:03:52,829 --> 00:03:58,320
of these new board members most actually

00:03:56,220 --> 00:04:01,200
all of them will be at not only Drupal

00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:02,730
Camp Drupal con Amsterdam but in

00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:06,209
Minneapolis as well so that'll be a

00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:08,940
chance for you to say hi in person on

00:04:06,209 --> 00:04:11,489
the road so in an effort to get out of

00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:14,190
the office and into the world we've been

00:04:11,489 --> 00:04:16,019
doing some fun things in particular here

00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:18,870
in my own backyard I got to attend my

00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:20,549
first Drupal camp and Carol who's our

00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:23,039
new director of marketing and outreach

00:04:20,549 --> 00:04:24,870
flew down to Atlanta to go with me so we

00:04:23,039 --> 00:04:27,330
got to spend time with the fine folks at

00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:29,430
Drupal Camp Atlanta got to see

00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:31,020
how the volunteers not only organized

00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:33,449
the effort but how the sponsors

00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:35,460
participate and if you haven't been to a

00:04:33,449 --> 00:04:37,229
camp of them in your local area I highly

00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:38,699
recommend it it's a great way to not

00:04:37,229 --> 00:04:41,069
only get to know the local Drupal

00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:42,990
community but to see how as businesses

00:04:41,069 --> 00:04:45,330
you can partner with developers and

00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:47,370
other Drupal businesses in the area and

00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:50,210
then Tim and I got to spend some time

00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:53,340
last week in the posh settings of Google

00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:54,840
where we were invited very kindly by

00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:57,000
Google to participate in the CMS

00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:58,409
Leadership Summit so this was not only a

00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,870
good opportunity to hear what's

00:04:58,409 --> 00:05:02,460
happening in CMS as a whole but we

00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:04,440
really got good time to collaborate with

00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:08,009
other CMS leaders and to share best

00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:09,210
practices and a few woes that we shared

00:05:08,009 --> 00:05:10,889
with each other as well and so

00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:12,479
everybody's got challenges we're not

00:05:10,889 --> 00:05:14,129
alone in that but it was great to spend

00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:19,259
time with that community and see how we

00:05:14,129 --> 00:05:21,150
can better collaborate and I will let

00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:23,340
Carrie talk to you all about our Google

00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:26,129

00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:56,039
discuss different ways that we can

00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:58,770

update from the engineering side in this

00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:22,750
update just because there's some news

00:08:26,889 --> 00:08:30,370
team side of things so there's a few

00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:32,800
items that I'd like to touch on the

00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:35,500
first one being that Drupal 8 8.0 is

00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:38,640
almost here so the Alpha window for this

00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:41,159
release begins the week of October 14th

00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:43,570
so that's the point at which we

00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:48,010
essentially have a feature freeze on

00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:49,910
what's going into Drupal 8.8 and then we

00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:52,160
do the rounds of testing those of

00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:54,620
you who might participate in the kind of

00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:58,460
community beta testing initiative will

00:08:54,620 --> 00:09:00,620
likely be contacted towards the end of

00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:03,230
October to be asked to participate in

00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:05,300
that process for this latest release the

00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:08,870
actual full release of Drupal 8 Toledo

00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:10,250
is scheduled for December 4th so before

00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:13,820
the end of the year they'll have this

00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:15,800
next minor release with a whole slew of

00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:17,390
new features and improvements I'll talk

00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:19,130
a little bit about those one of the

00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:21,050
exciting things about Drupal 8 today is

00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:23,390
it's kind of the last regular six-month

00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:26,450
release before we get into the 9.0

00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:28,010
release process next June so it's a

00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:30,320
really exciting moment it's kind of

00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:32,500
putting the cherry on top of the Drupal

00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:35,810
8 cake before we move on to the next one

00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:40,550
so that road to Drupal 9 this is a

00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:41,900
little bit of a hard to follow image but

00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:44,660
it's useful if you check out drupal.org

00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:46,850
slash road map you can take a look what

00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:48,980
you'll see is that in that December

00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:51,740
release window at the beginning of this

00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:53,360
chart that's when a date is released 8:7

00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:55,160
received security coverage all the way

00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:57,950
until the next release window six months

00:09:55,160 --> 00:10:01,070
later and that six month rated release

00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:04,880
will be both the release of Drupal 8 9.0

00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:07,220
and 9.0 and those will be essentially

00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:09,740
feature identical except nine dotto will

00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:12,710
have the backwards compatibility break

00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:14,930
that represents what that next major

00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:16,700
version means so it's really exciting

00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:19,790
times there's a lot more information

00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:21,950
about this release process again on the

00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:23,510
roadmap and there will be some blogs and

00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:27,500
other information coming out from the

00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:29,630
core maintainer team fairly soon one of

00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:31,280
the key things that's happened in 8.8

00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:34,220
that I'm personally really proud of

00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:35,780
because my team was heavily involved is

00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:38,630
there was a strong initiative to create

00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:40,520
better composer support in Drupal core

00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:43,340
and to ensure that whether you started

00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:45,110
off by using a you know a tar or a zip

00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:47,600
file to download your site in sort of

00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:49,100
the old fashioned Drupal 7 way or

00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,580
whether you use composer from the

00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:51,320
beginning

00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:53,840
you're not going to paint yourself into

00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:56,090
a corner if you need to later on depend

00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:59,410
on a different library or require a

00:10:56,090 --> 00:11:03,610
composer workflow so beginning with 8.8

00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:03,610
it's going to be a really clean

00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:08,630
easy-to-manage situation for people who

00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:10,460
are using composure or not yet using

00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:12,950
composure or thinking about using

00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:14,720
composure with their sight installations

00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:16,250
and all of the work of this initiative

00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,200
which has been one of the major core

00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:20,000
initiatives all of the key work is

00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:21,710
already committed so we know it's gonna

00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,030
make it into this release there's still

00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:25,340
some work going on in that initiative

00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:27,110
but it's really just little bug fixes

00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:28,880
and some documentation changes and stuff

00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:31,340
so we know we've hit that milestone and

00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,840
that's awesome

00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:34,670
so from there I want to talk about

00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:36,170
they're sort of regular Drupal at

00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:37,700
Oregon's nearing updates but you'll

00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:39,800
notice that there's a lot of overlap

00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:41,870
here with Drupal itself and that's

00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:45,050
because in kind of this modern Drupal 8

00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:47,180
coming up on Drupal 9 era you know it's

00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:48,650
a services connected product Drupal

00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:50,180
calls home to drupal.org

00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:52,940
to get a lot of related things that it

00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:54,350
might need and so drupal.org in addition

00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:55,880
to being the home of the community is

00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:58,370
also sort of an essential service

00:11:55,880 --> 00:12:01,640
provider for Drupal itself ensuring that

00:11:58,370 --> 00:12:04,670
that software works so related to the

00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:06,710
topic above we are updating the way that

00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:08,750
we package the releases on Drupal Ettore

00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:11,660
to take advantage of these new features

00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:13,640
committed to Drupal again so that

00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:15,350
whenever someone comes to Drupal a dork

00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:18,260
to download they're already ready to go

00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:20,780
with the sort of best practice

00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:23,590
scaffolding set up to use composer in

00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:26,570
their site development in the future

00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:28,820
finally are actually not finally in

00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:30,710
addition we're also working on all the

00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:32,300
infrastructure support for the automatic

00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:34,730
updates initiative which is going on

00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:37,730
going so it's gonna reach a first

00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:39,140
milestone as we come into Amsterdam in

00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:40,910
the end of the year but there'll be

00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:42,290
ongoing milestones and additional

00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:45,110
enhancements that are still needed as

00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:47,120
part of this initiative however one of

00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:50,000
the key elements of all of this is

00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:53,930
ensuring that we can deliver trusted

00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,400
secure update packages because as soon

00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:56,810
as we start automating anything that

00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:58,160
changes the code base of a site we

00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:59,930
really want to be sure of that so

00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:01,730
there's an issue you can look at if

00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:05,330
you're if you want to nerd out about

00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:08,330
security best practices but to put it

00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:10,220
short where we're using sort of hardware

00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:12,110
security management key signing and

00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:14,090
package delivery and validation and

00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:15,680
automatic expiration all the sort of

00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:16,430
cutting-edge security stuff that will

00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:19,520
hopefully ensure

00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:21,680
that Drupal's security process is one of

00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:23,630
the most robust not just sort of in the

00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:27,800
PHP world but in the sort of CMS world

00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:29,570
in general similarly of course once we

00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:30,890
have that security infrastructure we're

00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:33,410
actually going to have to serve the

00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:34,670
automatic update packages and so when

00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:36,590
we're generating an automatic update

00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:38,930
what drupal.org is going to be doing is

00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:40,970
actually taking the current the new

00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:45,740
updated version the previous version and

00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:47,090
generating this sort of meta patch of

00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:48,500
the difference between the two to

00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:50,180
deliver two sites through this automatic

00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:51,800
update service so we're putting in place

00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:55,130
the infrastructure to generate that

00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:58,910
right now and get us ready for this new

00:13:55,130 --> 00:14:01,570
set of features finally we're doing a

00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:04,610
lot of work in coordination with the

00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:09,260
sort of Drupal 9 readiness initiative

00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:12,320
mostly led by Gabor but in particular

00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:14,120
we're trying to help audit and provide

00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,830
test data to all of our module

00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:17,450
maintainer x' to know whether or not

00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:19,340
their Drupal 8 modules are ready for

00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:21,140
Drupal 9 and this is really exciting

00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:23,990
there's a big difference between the

00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:25,910
transition from 7 to 8 and 8 to 9 for an

00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:27,800
for a Drupal 8 module to be compatible

00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:30,920
with Drupal mine it just needs to avoid

00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:33,080
use of any of this sort of deprecated

00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:34,580
API s that were maybe no longer using in

00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:37,310
the 9 release which is a much easier

00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:39,890
lift and as a result as we started doing

00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:41,390
this automated audit more than 40% of

00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:43,730
the contributed projects for Jubilate

00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:45,710
will already work they're already

00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:47,600
compatible with Drupal 9 and that was

00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:49,310
with essentially no effort required on

00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:53,810
the part of the module in maintainer x'

00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:55,520
and so we're continuing to regularly run

00:14:53,810 --> 00:15:00,290
this this number keeps going up and up

00:14:55,520 --> 00:15:02,630
and up as as the Drupal 9 readiness team

00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:05,690
alerts folks as to hey here's the here's

00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:07,220
the major here's the major reason that

00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:08,960
modules might still not be compatible

00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:10,610
and usually it's just small little API

00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:12,950
changes that can be fixed pretty quickly

00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:17,090
so we're really hopeful actually that

00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:19,070
there will be a lot of almost a majority

00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:20,870
of Drupal 8 projects ready to use out of

00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:23,450
the box with Drupal 9 by the time we hit

00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:24,470
that release so that's very exciting and

00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:26,090
they'll hopefully be more news at

00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:30,900
Amsterdam and you can follow along at

00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:32,760
the at drop is moving Twitter handle

00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:36,650
I also just want to remind everyone not

00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:39,540
to forget when Drupal 7 and triple-a

00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:42,810
reach end-of-life and again some of this

00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:44,490
release information so again Drupal 7

00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:48,450
and Drupal 8 are both scheduled to have

00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:51,000
their end-of-life in November of 2021 so

00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:52,620
that sounds in some ways like a long way

00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
away and in some ways like it's right

00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:55,650
around the corner so it's not too early

00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,260
to start thinking about your migration

00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:59,850
strategy into Drupal 9 if you're already

00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:01,290
on 8 it's going to be easy it's not

00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:01,710
going to be significantly harder than

00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:05,670
the last

00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:07,410
then then upgrade in a month to Drupal

00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:09,240
8.8 it won't be won't be my very

00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:11,790
different if you're still on seven you

00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:13,800
may have some more work to do so there

00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:16,260
will be extended support available so if

00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:17,700
you search for say Drupal 7 extended

00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:20,400
support you'll see some information

00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:22,770
about the vendor provided extended

00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:24,840
support beyond this timeline but either

00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:27,300
way we're excited for Drupal mines

00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:29,460
release again June 2020 there is a

00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:30,840
fallback date if there was some reason

00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:32,670
why we had to push that and that would

00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:34,440
be December 2020 but it's looking pretty

00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:37,740
unlikely but that's gonna be necessary

00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:40,290
so so yeah just make sure to save those

00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:42,450
dates and be be ready to go with all of

00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:44,460

the community but also are now

00:16:54,630 --> 00:17:01,110

and growing awareness if if you as a

00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:16,780
business have ideas about where you

00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:18,730
think Drupal should be where the DA

00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:20,830
should be where should we be speaking

00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:22,780
what event should we be attending that

00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:25,030
you think would help not only the DA
