hello everyone and welcome to the Drupal

00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:09,990
Association webinar where we have our

00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:11,940
special guest Whitney has he's going to

00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:14,490
be talking about evolving Drupal

00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:16,830
community governance and I just want to

00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:18,930
first start by thanking everyone who's

00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:25,500
engaged in the community discussions it

00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:27,150
is a really special process that we're

00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,710
going through of the community so that

00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:33,710
we can be healthier and build a better

00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:37,649
future for ourselves and I personally am

00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:39,210
glad this is happening because obviously

00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:43,469
I come to work every day to serve the

00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:45,750
community and I can only do as well as I

00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:48,899
understand in terms of community needs

00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:51,600
and stretches you want to use for moving

00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:55,079
Drupal forward so personally I am really

00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:58,020
thankful for this that this effort and

00:00:55,079 --> 00:01:02,210
the community discussions are the

00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:05,700
community's way of starting to surface

00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:07,170
what you know what they want to do where

00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:09,600
they want to focus in terms of evolving

00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:11,310
community governance and the Drupal

00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,020
Association is just honor that we can

00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:15,570

and we want to keep an ear out to

00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:19,770
Whitney's messages to not only hear what

00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:21,780
the needs and strategies are where we

00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:24,689
might be able to help next but also just

00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:26,400
to help the community hear where they

00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:29,340
want to go next in this community

00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,500
governance process because we're in

00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:34,950

might be we want to understand what we

00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:43,979
can do to help community the community

00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:49,829

00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:52,409
I want to thank Whitney and super

00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:54,630
grateful for Whitney's expertise and

00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:57,000
care making sure that she has a diverse

00:01:54,630 --> 00:02:00,060
perspective of the community's needs she

00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,100
had spent hours and hours not only in

00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:04,469
group sessions but one-on-one calls and

00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:06,960
making sure she's reaching out to those

00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:12,840
not only in North America and Europe but

00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:16,410
also in India and China and in -

00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:18,209
South America Costa Rica got it just

00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:21,090
lost track of all the places that you

00:02:18,209 --> 00:02:22,709
have been reaching out Whitney but thank

00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:25,290
you so much for your work and I'm really

00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:28,290
excited to hand this over to you so you

00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:30,750
could share your findings from this

00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:34,980
community discussion as well as how we

00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:39,000
move forward thank you so much Megan and

00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:42,690
thank you for allowing me to be a part

00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:47,130
of this very important work thank you to

00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:49,590
everyone for tuning in today I greatly

00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:52,890
appreciate your presence and your

00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:55,530
engagement and thank you to those who

00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:59,299
will be watching this video later it's

00:02:55,530 --> 00:03:02,160
great to know that there are so many

00:02:59,299 --> 00:03:04,709
caring and concerned members of the

00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:09,480
Drupal community who want to participate

00:03:04,709 --> 00:03:11,730
in this process so let me just start off

00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:16,110
by saying that I'm going to try to keep

00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:18,720
this brief I really felt that it was

00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:22,799
important to hold a webinar to walk

00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:26,400
through these findings rather than just

00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:28,620
setting out a slide presentation and

00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:31,799
kind of hoping that everyone understood

00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:35,010
the key points but I also don't want to

00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:37,290
belabor this if you have specific

00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:38,880
questions I'll be sharing with you where

00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:41,370
you can ask those questions and where

00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:43,970
force you can comment on these findings

00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:47,880
but here's what I would like to cover

00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:50,340
hopefully within a half hours time I'm

00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:52,590
going to share the methodology that

00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:55,220
we've been using what this process has

00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:59,069
entailed and then there will be some

00:03:55,220 --> 00:04:01,260
findings and proposals in the form of

00:03:59,069 --> 00:04:04,709
what the shared needs of the community

00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:07,169
are how we're defining those needs the

00:04:04,709 --> 00:04:10,200
areas for improvement that the community

00:04:07,169 --> 00:04:12,480
has been identifying and potential

00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:15,569
strategies that the community is

00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:18,239
proposing for ways to better meet those

00:04:15,569 --> 00:04:21,450
needs then I have a set of open

00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:24,210
questions that remain open and that the

00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:26,320
community really still needs to come

00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:28,630
together to answer for itself

00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:30,580
and a few next steps that I'll be

00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:33,220
participating in and helping to

00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:38,380
facilitate as the community moves this

00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:41,800
forward so to catch you up if you have

00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:44,500
not yet been aware of what's going on

00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:47,230
with this process that Megan's been

00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:50,950
talking about the recent events in the

00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:53,970
community led the Drupal Association to

00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:57,370
realize that it could play a role in

00:04:53,970 --> 00:05:00,520
providing a safe space for the community

00:04:57,370 --> 00:05:03,210
to have discussions to share their

00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:07,090
feelings and needs thoughts and ideas

00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:11,580
around how to evolve community

00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:14,320
governance and I came forward to be a

00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:17,980
facilitator and mediator of that process

00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:20,200
and this has been happening over the

00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:21,400
course of several months now we started

00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:25,630
in mid-april

00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:30,090
just before DrupalCon Baltimore and in

00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:33,520
that time I have personally conducted

00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:35,680
upwards of 27 one-on-one interviews it

00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:38,020
may have been a couple since I actually

00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,120
counted that number one-on-one

00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:43,660
interviews with both leaders and

00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:45,790
contributors worldwide all of those

00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:48,700
regions of the world that Megan

00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:51,520
mentioned we tried to cover everywhere

00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:55,180
as much as we possibly could we also

00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:58,180
held seven hour-long community

00:05:55,180 --> 00:06:00,880
discussions at DrupalCon Baltimore and

00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:03,730
another seven long discussions with a

00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:08,260
very similar format held online be

00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:10,600
assumed in the first two weeks of May so

00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:12,550
those DrupalCon Baltimore sessions came

00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:14,200
first in-person and then the online

00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:18,150
sessions for the global community to

00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:22,270
participate and in total we had about

00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:25,960
150 unique participants from the

00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:28,360
community to attend these sessions and

00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:32,290
many of them contribute in these

00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:35,710
sessions the discussions were greatly

00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:37,990
focused on what the current state of

00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:39,639
community governance is and what the

00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:43,979
desired state is and

00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:48,669
what that gap currently remains as I

00:06:43,979 --> 00:06:50,800
then synthesize the themes across all of

00:06:48,669 --> 00:06:52,090
those community discussions as well as

00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,550
the one-on-one interviews that I

00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:59,080
conducted and what I'm sharing with you

00:06:54,550 --> 00:07:01,419
today is that synthesis all names and

00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:03,279
personally identifiable information of

00:07:01,419 --> 00:07:04,990
all the participants whether it be

00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:07,449
people that attended the community

00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:10,229
discussions or people who I helped

00:07:07,449 --> 00:07:13,750
one-on-one interviews with all of that

00:07:10,229 --> 00:07:16,389
personal information has been kept 100%

00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:18,849
confidential and it continues to be and

00:07:16,389 --> 00:07:22,240
that includes confidante confidentiality

00:07:18,849 --> 00:07:26,050
from the Drupal Association and from

00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:29,409
trees and from cwg I have conducted

00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:31,360
these sessions personally and know none

00:07:29,409 --> 00:07:33,909
of those names or personally

00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:37,169
identifiable information will be going

00:07:33,909 --> 00:07:41,589
anywhere outside of my personal notes

00:07:37,169 --> 00:07:45,580
however we did want to ensure that the

00:07:41,589 --> 00:07:48,900
content of these discussions was being

00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:52,919
made publicly available and so we had

00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:56,319
the mini meeting minutes for the

00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:58,149
community discussions those seven at

00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:02,020
Drupal con Baltimore and the seven that

00:07:58,149 --> 00:08:05,500
were held online and those are posted on

00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:08,379
drupal.org let's see if it's going to

00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:12,879
show the URL here it's drupal.org slash

00:08:08,379 --> 00:08:16,349
community slash discussions if you wish

00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:19,930
to see the raw contents of those

00:08:16,349 --> 00:08:22,330
individual community discussions but

00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:25,649
what I'm sharing with you today is the

00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:25,649
synthesis of those themes

00:08:26,129 --> 00:08:32,349
so what I did was as part of the

00:08:30,039 --> 00:08:35,860
community discussions we listed out the

00:08:32,349 --> 00:08:37,810
shared needs that the participants of

00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:40,630
each session were feeling we're not

00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:44,560
currently being met as adequately as

00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:47,850
they could be within the community and I

00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:51,820
then tallied those set of needs from all

00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:55,779
14 of the community discussion sessions

00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:58,240
and I came up with the most common

00:08:55,779 --> 00:09:01,420
shared needs and what you're seeing here

00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:04,060
are those most common needs in order of

00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:08,050
frequency from most frequent to least

00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:11,560
and these 13 needs that I've captured

00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:14,440
here were identified in at least eight

00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:17,320
of the 14 sessions meaning that these

00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:19,870
are really the top of the top most

00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:21,910
common needs that people feel are not

00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:25,899
currently being met as adequately as

00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:30,250
they could be now across those 14

00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:33,190
community discussions 75 unique needs

00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:35,709
were identified and if you wish to see

00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:38,020
that full list of needs there's a link

00:09:35,709 --> 00:09:39,910
here which we will be providing on this

00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:42,220
deck I'm just going to show it to you

00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:47,490
briefly so you can see what was involved

00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:51,040
in this here is the full list 75 needs

00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:54,990
unique needs that were identified and

00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:57,490
then I went through and tallied that and

00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:59,829
counted the number of mentions across

00:09:57,490 --> 00:10:04,690
those 14 sessions and then kind of put

00:09:59,829 --> 00:10:08,829
them in order of frequency so just

00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:11,790
trying to show that this was a somewhat

00:10:08,829 --> 00:10:15,070
systematic process not scientific but

00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:18,399
systematic so I'm going to take you

00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:21,820
through each of these needs and give you

00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:24,519
the definition that we are using to

00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:26,290
differentiate between these so that

00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:28,839
there's crystal clear understanding of

00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:31,660
what we mean I each of these words

00:10:28,839 --> 00:10:33,399
because of course understanding was one

00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:36,010
of the needs that was identified so I

00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:38,019
wanted to try to meet that need as best

00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:42,619
as I can

00:10:38,019 --> 00:10:44,389
so we have definitions here and I

00:10:42,619 --> 00:10:46,009
apologize for the density of text but

00:10:44,389 --> 00:10:48,619
I'm going to read through each of these

00:10:46,009 --> 00:10:51,110
and help to kind of find the distinction

00:10:48,619 --> 00:10:53,569
between them so the number one needs

00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:55,879
that was discovered is awareness and I'm

00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:58,839
defining this as knowledge of a

00:10:55,879 --> 00:11:02,059
situation or fact a lot of people

00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:04,249
attended these community discussions

00:11:02,059 --> 00:11:07,639
because they wanted to be aware of what

00:11:04,249 --> 00:11:09,319
was going on they heard rumblings of

00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:12,980
something where they were having

00:11:09,319 --> 00:11:14,720
in-depth discussions with their friends

00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:16,519
and colleagues in the community but they

00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,649
wanted to know what other people knew

00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:20,509
what other people were aware of what

00:11:18,649 --> 00:11:23,829
other people were thinking feeling and

00:11:20,509 --> 00:11:26,600
needing so really just wanting to

00:11:23,829 --> 00:11:30,649
broaden and deepen their knowledge of

00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:35,660
what was happening I'm hearing a little

00:11:30,649 --> 00:11:37,610
bit of background noise so just for

00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:39,649
everyone if you could mute yourself that

00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:43,999
would be great would help me be a little

00:11:39,649 --> 00:11:46,759
less effective thank you so much so the

00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:49,129
second most common is participation and

00:11:46,759 --> 00:11:51,980
this is what I'm defining as the act of

00:11:49,129 --> 00:11:56,119
taking part really just being a part of

00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:58,220
this process what and that is I think a

00:11:56,119 --> 00:12:01,220
really encouraging thing to find that

00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:03,499
this is such a participatory community

00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:05,509
that people really aren't going to

00:12:03,499 --> 00:12:08,480
accept things just happening to them

00:12:05,509 --> 00:12:12,980
without being an active part of the

00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:16,339
process next was transparency openness

00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:19,429
to public scrutiny people were really

00:12:16,339 --> 00:12:23,179
wanting there to be greater transparency

00:12:19,429 --> 00:12:25,999
of decisions that were being made by

00:12:23,179 --> 00:12:28,519
leaders of the community wanting

00:12:25,999 --> 00:12:30,889
transparency into what that process is

00:12:28,519 --> 00:12:31,279
for decision making how decisions are

00:12:30,889 --> 00:12:34,069
made

00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:36,040
why decisions are made and bringing the

00:12:34,069 --> 00:12:39,110
public meaning the community at large

00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:42,920
into that process so that it isn't

00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:45,919
happening behind closed doors next with

00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:48,980
clarity the quality of coherence and

00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:51,139
intelligibility this is in clarity of

00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:54,489
communication clarity of

00:12:51,139 --> 00:12:58,639
process clarity of decision-making

00:12:54,489 --> 00:13:01,609
clarity of policy people are really

00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:06,790
wanting there to be a greater coherence

00:13:01,609 --> 00:13:11,749
a greater understanding and crispness of

00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:13,160
the messages that are delivered and the

00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:16,399
policies that are held within the

00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:19,609
community so that there's less confusion

00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:21,910
about what is what and what definitions

00:13:19,609 --> 00:13:25,069
are and things of that nature

00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:27,889
next was a need for contribution and

00:13:25,069 --> 00:13:31,730
this is more than participation which is

00:13:27,889 --> 00:13:33,859
being a part of the process contribution

00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:36,589
is really being a part of cleaning about

00:13:33,859 --> 00:13:40,100
the result or helping to advance the

00:13:36,589 --> 00:13:41,749
process so there were a lot of people

00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:43,579
that attended these community

00:13:41,749 --> 00:13:46,910
discussions that felt a personal

00:13:43,579 --> 00:13:51,290
responsibility for being a part of the

00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:53,089
solution and wanted to contribute in a

00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:58,939
way that they felt like they weren't yet

00:13:53,089 --> 00:14:01,819
being engaged to do fully Healing was

00:13:58,939 --> 00:14:03,829
another very common theme that resulted

00:14:01,819 --> 00:14:07,189
from these sessions the process of

00:14:03,829 --> 00:14:09,980
becoming healthy again many people felt

00:14:07,189 --> 00:14:14,809
as if recent events over the past

00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:16,759
several years had caused a deterioration

00:14:14,809 --> 00:14:20,299
of the health of the Drupal community

00:14:16,759 --> 00:14:23,209
and they really have been feeling a need

00:14:20,299 --> 00:14:26,149
to heal as a community and to come

00:14:23,209 --> 00:14:30,949
together and unify and move forward as

00:14:26,149 --> 00:14:34,669
one next is trust which I'm defining as

00:14:30,949 --> 00:14:37,039
the firm belief in the reliability truth

00:14:34,669 --> 00:14:40,429
ability or strength of someone or

00:14:37,039 --> 00:14:44,389
something this could be the trust in the

00:14:40,429 --> 00:14:46,879
leadership trust in process trust in the

00:14:44,389 --> 00:14:50,299
governance model trust in other

00:14:46,879 --> 00:14:51,980
community members this extended to a lot

00:14:50,299 --> 00:14:53,600
of things but there were certainly a

00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:56,600
feeling that there was a lack of

00:14:53,600 --> 00:15:00,249
reliability or lack of strength in some

00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:00,249
of the aspects of the Drupal community

00:15:00,279 --> 00:15:04,490
understanding which is the ability to

00:15:02,809 --> 00:15:06,620
perceive the significant

00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:08,300
answer or an exhalation or a cause of

00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:09,230
something's that what's the cause and

00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:11,660
effect here

00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:14,899
there was definitely a desire for a

00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:17,080
greater understanding of why things were

00:15:14,899 --> 00:15:19,610
happening the way they were and just

00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:23,270
understanding what the catalyst of

00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:26,330
recent events had been and and why there

00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:29,529
was a call for an evolution of the

00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:33,100
community governance as a result

00:15:29,529 --> 00:15:35,360
communication was another big need so

00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:37,850
successfully conveying or sharing

00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:40,100
information and ideas and the key word

00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:42,860
here is successful so certainly there

00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:46,310
have been communications that have

00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:50,290
resulted from recent events or have been

00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:54,130
a regular part of either Treves

00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:57,170
governance process technical leadership

00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:59,860
Drupal Association support of the

00:15:57,170 --> 00:16:02,330
community community working group

00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:05,600
communications do come out of these

00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:07,070
various governing bodies but that

00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,350
doesn't necessarily mean that it's a

00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:10,970
successful conveying of the information

00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:13,700
and that goes back to the clarity as

00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:15,440
well so people are really wanting more

00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:18,800
frequent communication and greater

00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:21,440
clarity of communication next is

00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:24,260
connection and this is really I see this

00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:27,589
as an umbrella need it encompasses so

00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:30,290
many others and that it really is what

00:16:27,589 --> 00:16:32,630
so many people are here for a connection

00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:35,390
with other community members strong

00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:37,670
links associations and relationships

00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:40,880
between members of the community and

00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:43,670
wanting to stay connected and bonded and

00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:46,550
be resilient through the many

00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:49,790
experiences that we have had and will

00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:51,800
continue to have at the community next

00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:54,440
is empowerment and this goes back to

00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:57,050
participation and contribution people

00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:59,029
really feeling a self responsibility to

00:16:57,050 --> 00:17:01,459
be a part of the process and to

00:16:59,029 --> 00:17:02,450
contribute to solutions and to the

00:17:01,459 --> 00:17:05,449
community success

00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:07,640
so when Powerman specifically is having

00:17:05,449 --> 00:17:10,280
the authority to do something to be able

00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:13,069
to control oneself to claim one's right

00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:15,169
as a member of this community this open

00:17:13,069 --> 00:17:17,569
source community where community

00:17:15,169 --> 00:17:18,970
participation and contribution is so

00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:22,579
critical

00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:24,829
next is processed where there is a

00:17:22,579 --> 00:17:27,439
systematic series of steps taken to

00:17:24,829 --> 00:17:30,530
achieve a particular end so that people

00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:33,710
know what the process is for a variety

00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:36,230
of situations in different realms of the

00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:39,080
community that that process be clear

00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:41,780
that it be well documented and that it

00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:43,820
be regularly followed consistent

00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:48,280
consistent in the way that it is

00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:50,330
utilized and then lastly progress an

00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:52,280
advancement toward a better more

00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:55,100
complete and more modern condition

00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:57,410
people really want to see the Drupal

00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:59,510
community move forward move forward

00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:01,910
together towards the healing as I

00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:05,270
mentioned earlier but really just not be

00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:10,040
stay stuck not be circling around these

00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:13,310
same issues and find a way to move

00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:16,250
forward successfully effectively

00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:19,760
together now as I showed you on that

00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:22,010
spreadsheet there were 75 needs that

00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:25,310
were identified as shared needs that the

00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:28,400
community has and that aren't being

00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:31,730
successfully and fully met these are the

00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:34,100
top 13 so these were the ones that were

00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:37,820
mentioned in at least eight of the 14

00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:41,660
community discussions and these are the

00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:43,820
ones that I am hearing are has the most

00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:46,450
heat around them would be a way that I

00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:50,240
would put it are the most relevant and

00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:54,260
most urgent for us to address at this

00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:56,780
time now there were some particular

00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:59,150
areas for improvement that came out of

00:18:56,780 --> 00:19:02,810
these community discussions as well as

00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:05,600
the many one-on-one interviews that I

00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:07,850
conducted as well and these are the

00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:11,240
areas for concern might be another way

00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:14,230
to state it things that people are truly

00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:16,550
concerned about that are press

00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:21,830
exacerbating these needs that aren't

00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:24,400
being met firstly one very common theme

00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:27,380
that arose from these discussions is

00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:30,650
Drees as the benevolent dictator for

00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:32,179
life btfl and as the single point of

00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:35,570
escalation this is the

00:19:32,179 --> 00:19:39,679
, concern for many people in the Drupal

00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:42,289
community another theme is the community

00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:44,869
work in Group C W G's process its

00:19:42,289 --> 00:19:47,210
membership meaning who belongs to the

00:19:44,869 --> 00:19:49,220
CWG and how that happens and the

00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:51,950
resources that they have available to

00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:56,049
them to do their job a volunteer job as

00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:58,639
effectively as possible next our

00:19:56,049 --> 00:20:01,309
concerns about conflicts of interest

00:19:58,639 --> 00:20:04,940
across Drupal entities meaning complex

00:20:01,309 --> 00:20:09,100
of interests between trees and community

00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:13,240
working group and Drupal Association and

00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:18,379
technical leadership and perhaps even

00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:22,549
for-profit Drupal companies and all of

00:20:18,379 --> 00:20:26,539
the different entities that make up this

00:20:22,549 --> 00:20:29,210
Drupal ecosystem another concern is

00:20:26,539 --> 00:20:32,889
around codes of conduct this didn't come

00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:35,539
up in as many of the Drupal community

00:20:32,889 --> 00:20:38,179
discussions as I was expecting going

00:20:35,539 --> 00:20:40,669
into it because of so much of the online

00:20:38,179 --> 00:20:43,340
discussion had really been about code of

00:20:40,669 --> 00:20:44,960
conduct the multiple codes of conduct

00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:46,610
that we have there's a Drupal code of

00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:49,129
conduct and there's also a Drupal con

00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:52,360
code of conduct there were definitely

00:20:49,129 --> 00:20:55,039
some mentions of ways we can improve it

00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:58,669
so I wanted to make sure to include it

00:20:55,039 --> 00:21:04,279
here but not as big of a theme as we had

00:20:58,669 --> 00:21:06,820
anticipated also a real need and desire

00:21:04,279 --> 00:21:09,980
around having more official

00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:11,450
communication channels so that people

00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:13,549
have a single source of information

00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:16,700
about what's happening in the Drupal

00:21:13,549 --> 00:21:22,429
community and and one place to tap into

00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:26,059
to stay up-to-date a real desire for

00:21:22,429 --> 00:21:28,220
better onboarding for new members of the

00:21:26,059 --> 00:21:30,919
Drupal community as people join the

00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:34,460
community as they begin to use Drupal as

00:21:30,919 --> 00:21:37,129
a platform on how to bring them up to

00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:40,429
speed on what this community is all

00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:43,609
about and what it means to be an

00:21:40,429 --> 00:21:45,890
effective and successful member of the

00:21:43,609 --> 00:21:48,290
Drupal community and this was found to

00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:50,810
he needed not only for new members but

00:21:48,290 --> 00:21:53,210
also for people that perhaps have been

00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:55,370
around a long time but whose engagement

00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:58,700
with the community is changing or who

00:21:55,370 --> 00:22:03,550
may not have all the information that

00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:05,900
they need to be a successful contributor

00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:08,440
findability and accessibility of

00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:10,730
guidelines and processes this extends to

00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:12,710
existing members of the community new

00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:15,230
members of the community really just

00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:17,900
again needing to know kind of where

00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:19,520
these things are and making sure that

00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:23,330
they're well documented and that they're

00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:28,130
up to date and current and and really

00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:31,580
consistent and then broke most broadly a

00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:34,130
need for a more crisp and clear

00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:37,100
definition of what the Drupal community

00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:38,930
means we use that word community to mean

00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:41,350
a lot of things and I'll be going into

00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:46,580
that in just a moment

00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:50,510
now I want to be clear that these are

00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:52,040
issues that have been coming up in the

00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:55,730
Drupal community for a long time and

00:22:52,040 --> 00:23:00,490
they continue to come up every time we

00:22:55,730 --> 00:23:05,170
kind of come to a pivotal moment in our

00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:09,940
evolution as a project but growth and

00:23:05,170 --> 00:23:15,350
time has made many of these issues

00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:19,970
bigger and more urgent so we're at a

00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:21,710
point now where perhaps we had bigger

00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:26,200
issues that had to be dealt with first

00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:31,190
and now we're seeing that there's really

00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:33,080
space for and engagement around these

00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:35,570
issues that are really rising to the

00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:37,550
surface so I thought it was important to

00:23:35,570 --> 00:23:39,560
name that because for many of you

00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:42,920
listening to this many of you will be

00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:44,600
listening later not this isn't news if

00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:46,130
you have been involved in the community

00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:49,130
for a long time these are issues that

00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:51,740
you've known about for a while but the

00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:53,810
truth will ecosystem has evolved and

00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:56,000
it's evolved beyond the developer

00:23:53,810 --> 00:24:00,130
community and our stakeholders have

00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:04,780
changed and as we continue to grow

00:24:00,130 --> 00:24:09,800
this necessitates an evolution of our

00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:13,820
governance model and perhaps clarity on

00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:17,630
how the community can change itself to

00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:19,880
be in better alignment of what the wider

00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:22,760
variety of stakeholders and Drupal

00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:25,040
community members need now so that's

00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:28,160
what we're really trying to shine the

00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:31,310
spotlight on that it's time it's really

00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:39,140
time to address some of these issues and

00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:43,790
I'm finding a real wave of engagement

00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:49,310
that is going to allow greater movement

00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:52,440
and solutions for these issues that have

00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:55,830
been lingering for some time

00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:58,830
now I just want to take a moment because

00:24:55,830 --> 00:25:02,850
I've been talking for a while I can see

00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:05,510
the videos again and I can I'm not just

00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:10,200
seeing my screen and I'm wondering are

00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:13,500
there questions already that perhaps I

00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:15,420
can address before I move forward Megan

00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:18,630
are you seeing anything coming over on

00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:20,250
your own I'm not but let me just ask the

00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:22,740
participant if you do have a question

00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:27,150
can you use the chat window and add your

00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:29,160
question there please if you're not

00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:31,230
seeing anything yet for the sake of time

00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:35,340
I'll move on but I will definitely come

00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:37,080
back in a little bit and check in okay

00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:38,520
great we have not seen anything in the

00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:42,080
chest so I think you can move forward

00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:42,080
thank you so much

00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:49,190
okay so I've stated so far kind of

00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:53,810
what's on people's mind what people feel

00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:56,480
are areas for improvement things areas

00:25:53,810 --> 00:26:02,900
of concern needs that aren't being met

00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:06,050
and the community is an engaged one and

00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:08,210
of the hundred and fifty or so people

00:26:06,050 --> 00:26:12,200
who have participated in this process so

00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:14,450
far there are many ideas for how we can

00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:16,400
meet these shared needs I'm calling

00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:19,190
these potential strategies these are not

00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:21,290
my recommendations I want to be really

00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:23,240
clear on that I'm not coming in as a

00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:24,740
consultant and saying I've heard your

00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:28,010
problems and this is how I think you

00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:31,970
should solve them I'm here to surface

00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:34,790
what the Drupal community itself wants

00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:36,740
to see change and so these are

00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:39,320
essentially proposals that have come

00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:41,420
from the Drupal community as a result of

00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:43,010
both the community discussions and the

00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:46,760
one-on-one interviews that I held and

00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:49,280
these were the most common themes that I

00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:51,830
heard there in no particular order the

00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:55,370
needs were listed from most frequently

00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:59,420
mentioned first but these are in no

00:26:55,370 --> 00:27:01,730
particular order these strategies I will

00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:03,650
go through in greater depth but I want

00:27:01,730 --> 00:27:08,540
to first provide a snapshot of what they

00:27:03,650 --> 00:27:12,310
all are so firstly there is a real

00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:15,500
desire to more concretely separate

00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:18,380
project governance from community

00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:22,280
governance and I'll talk a little bit

00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:24,020
more about what that means I already

00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:27,140
mentioned this but there is a real

00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:29,930
desire to see a single location for

00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:33,490
official Drupal communications so that

00:27:29,930 --> 00:27:36,830
people know where to pay attention for

00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:39,230
changes that are coming news updates

00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:43,100
decisions and other important

00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:46,460
information there's a desire for a

00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:49,760
formal clarification of the variety of

00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:52,640
roles that Trees holds in the Drupal

00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:55,070
community and project a formal

00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:56,450
clarification of all leadership roles in

00:27:55,070 --> 00:28:00,170
the Drupal project

00:27:56,450 --> 00:28:03,260
so that everyone knows at what the

00:28:00,170 --> 00:28:06,920
leaders responsibilities are what the

00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:09,640
their jurisdiction is how they received

00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:12,110
that role what the process is for

00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:16,790
removing someone from a leadership role

00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:21,080
etc there is a potential strategy event

00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:24,410
proposal for Greece to step down as the

00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:26,480
Drupal Association Board Chair as a way

00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:29,320
to remove some of those concerns about

00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:35,950
conflict of interest I will note that

00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:39,800
Dreamz does recuse himself from board

00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:41,330
decisions when he feels and when other

00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:43,730
board members feel that there is a

00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:46,600
conflict of interest so there is already

00:28:43,730 --> 00:28:51,080
some process in place for that but there

00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:52,850
was a proposal several people had made a

00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:54,830
proposal that perhaps one of the ways

00:28:52,850 --> 00:28:56,870
that we could address some of these

00:28:54,830 --> 00:29:00,410
concerns of conflict of interest would

00:28:56,870 --> 00:29:04,250
be to have juries spread around more of

00:29:00,410 --> 00:29:08,300
his responsibilities to others there's a

00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:10,550
desire to see more formalization that's

00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:14,360
the word more formality that's the one

00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:16,760
and on a greater maturity for the

00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:20,480
processes and policies of the community

00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:23,030
working group a proposal for the Drupal

00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:25,600
Association to have a greater support of

00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:28,580
community management the DA is

00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:31,250
supporting this process as you heard

00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:32,330
from Megan in the beginning of today's

00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:35,990
webinar

00:29:32,330 --> 00:29:38,600
there is absolutely some involvement

00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:41,210
from the Drupal Association today but

00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:44,600
it's mostly because it's filling a gap

00:29:41,210 --> 00:29:46,970
and it's less formal and official but

00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:49,610
there's a real call from members of the

00:29:46,970 --> 00:29:52,430
community to see more of this and forbid

00:29:49,610 --> 00:29:56,750
rupal associations to play a bigger role

00:29:52,430 --> 00:29:58,460
in managing the community there is a

00:29:56,750 --> 00:30:01,220
desire for more community elected

00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:04,640
leadership positions as I mentioned

00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:07,070
there some proposals for how to revise

00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:09,830
or perhaps even consolidate the code of

00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:12,740
conduct codes of conduct

00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:15,919
there were proposals around having some

00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:18,620
sort of core values defined for the

00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:21,500
community to be a companion document to

00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:24,769
the Code of Conduct and then a desire

00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:27,320
for a governance summit of some kind to

00:30:24,769 --> 00:30:29,090
craft revisions to the community

00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:32,289
governance and to start an

00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:35,929
implementation plan so those are the

00:30:32,289 --> 00:30:39,679
high-level potential strategies to meet

00:30:35,929 --> 00:30:43,580
our shared needs as a community more

00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:48,019
detail on each of those eleven potential

00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:50,510
strategies so firstly the separation of

00:30:48,019 --> 00:30:53,120
the project and the community oversight

00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:55,549
and governance there's a real belief

00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:58,279
that there are very independent

00:30:55,549 --> 00:31:01,549
interests and skill sets when it comes

00:30:58,279 --> 00:31:06,230
to the technical and project governance

00:31:01,549 --> 00:31:09,070
of Drupal the platform from the Drupal

00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:12,380
community and what is required to

00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:14,330
oversee and manage and govern that and

00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:16,460
so people are really wanting to see

00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:18,470
greater boundaries between the two so

00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:21,500
that when we talk about governance we're

00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:24,710
not meaning one thing that encompasses

00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:27,799
both project and community and there's a

00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:30,860
real feeling that if we separate them

00:31:27,799 --> 00:31:33,169
better there that will reduce conflicts

00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:35,090
of interest between them and a

00:31:33,169 --> 00:31:38,750
clarification of which positions our

00:31:35,090 --> 00:31:41,330
leadership roles and where there's a

00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:42,919
difference in leadership in the project

00:31:41,330 --> 00:31:44,330
and technical governance and where

00:31:42,919 --> 00:31:48,559
there's leadership in community

00:31:44,330 --> 00:31:51,440
governance next is a single location for

00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:54,470
the official Drupal communications right

00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:56,330
now many of the communications that we

00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:59,510
read to know what's going on which

00:31:56,330 --> 00:32:02,570
people are on dreamz's personal website

00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:06,340
the community working group posts in one

00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:09,380
location DEA staff post in another

00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:11,299
there's a lot of different places that

00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:13,940
we have to pay attention to and there's

00:32:11,299 --> 00:32:17,330
a desire for kind of that unified feed

00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:19,549
so that we are able to tune into one

00:32:17,330 --> 00:32:21,590
place and can always be up-to-date on

00:32:19,549 --> 00:32:22,700
what's going on with the project and in

00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:24,560
the community

00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:26,810
and a real desire for those

00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:29,330
communications to be written very

00:32:26,810 --> 00:32:32,570
clearly and to be published frequently

00:32:29,330 --> 00:32:36,680
so that people can stay involved and for

00:32:32,570 --> 00:32:40,040
greater transparency as well next we

00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:41,870
have kind of the issue of many hats this

00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:43,550
was something that came up in many of

00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:45,170
the community discussions as well as

00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:48,470
many of the one-on-one interviews that I

00:32:45,170 --> 00:32:50,870
held a real desire for clarity around

00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:53,930
the roles that Greece plays in the

00:32:50,870 --> 00:32:56,330
project in the community which role

00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:59,110
holds what responsibilities and what

00:32:56,330 --> 00:33:01,970
authority is granted to that role and

00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:05,750
more explicit boundaries between those

00:33:01,970 --> 00:33:09,260
roles to know which role dreamz's in

00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:14,810
with each official communication Greece

00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:16,600
has very strongly self-identified what

00:33:14,810 --> 00:33:19,490
role he's in when he make certain

00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:22,970
decisions or when he communicates on

00:33:19,490 --> 00:33:24,790
things and at times he has named what

00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:29,480
that role is but people are really

00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:31,640
wanting more explicitness around it and

00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:33,620
an acknowledgement people are wanting a

00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:35,900
knowledge Monteux conflicts of interest

00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:37,760
that arise and the unintentional biases

00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:40,460
that come with holding multiple

00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:43,910
positions in the community and in the

00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:47,900
project and there's a real desire to see

00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:50,720
a maturation beyond benevolent dictator

00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:53,540
for life and some form of succession

00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:55,340
plan in place that allows trees to share

00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:57,740
more of his responsibilities with others

00:33:55,340 --> 00:34:01,130
and he has said on multiple occasions

00:33:57,740 --> 00:34:03,590
and he even said multiple times from the

00:34:01,130 --> 00:34:05,450
stage at Rubicon Baltimore but this is

00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:08,090
something he would really like to see as

00:34:05,450 --> 00:34:10,550
well that is not comfortable for him to

00:34:08,090 --> 00:34:13,490
be the single point of escalation or to

00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:15,500
play all these different roles that do

00:34:13,490 --> 00:34:18,170
sometimes conflict with one another so

00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:20,570
that's that's a great sign to show that

00:34:18,170 --> 00:34:23,600
the Drupal project and the community is

00:34:20,570 --> 00:34:28,010
growing and maturing and we need to move

00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:30,860
forward with other solutions similarly

00:34:28,010 --> 00:34:33,080
there's a real desire for formal

00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:36,050
clarification of all leadership roles in

00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:38,240
the Drupal project who does what there's

00:34:36,050 --> 00:34:40,160
quite a few people in the drupal

00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:43,400
community that don't know what the

00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:45,260
Drupal Association is what it does what

00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:47,660
the difference is between its staff and

00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:50,060
its board of directors what the

00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:53,720
community working group is and who it is

00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:56,840
and what it does its relationship work

00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:59,630
not to the Drupal Association the

00:34:56,840 --> 00:35:03,560
difference between these roles and tech

00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:05,660
and project leads track shares of Drupal

00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:07,790
con etc there's a lot of different

00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:09,620
leadership roles in the community many

00:35:07,790 --> 00:35:14,090
that I haven't even named so there's a

00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:16,610
need for better clarity around what each

00:35:14,090 --> 00:35:17,900
of these roles are what they entail what

00:35:16,610 --> 00:35:21,830
the responsibilities are what their

00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:27,920
authority is etc and there's also a

00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:30,170
desire to to name the extent to which

00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:32,540
any of these leadership roles have an

00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:36,440
effect or therefore an influence on the

00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:39,140
technical direction of Drupal then as I

00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:41,030
mentioned there's a proposal for trees

00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:44,300
to step down as the Drupal Association

00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:47,000
board chair that he would retain a

00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:48,860
founder seat which is fairly common but

00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:51,250
he would still be a member of the board

00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:53,570
but that there would be a more neutral

00:35:51,250 --> 00:35:56,750
chairperson who will be appointed by the

00:35:53,570 --> 00:35:59,780
board this would be someone who does not

00:35:56,750 --> 00:36:03,020
have a stake in a for-profit Drupal

00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:06,530
entity a business for instance someone

00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:09,290
who has board of director experience but

00:36:06,530 --> 00:36:13,900
that can play a more neutral role so

00:36:09,290 --> 00:36:16,550
that it contributes to easing and

00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:18,200
resolving some of the perceived

00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:21,350
conflicts of interest whether they're

00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:23,240
real or perception whether they're

00:36:21,350 --> 00:36:25,250
intentional or unintentional there

00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:27,510
definitely needs to be a solution that

00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:30,190
addresses it

00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:33,670
then we have a proposal for the

00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:35,890
community working group cwg to formalize

00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:38,170
and mature to expand its number of

00:36:35,890 --> 00:36:42,880
members which it has done it has added

00:36:38,170 --> 00:36:45,130
two members in recent weeks to have term

00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:47,140
limits perhaps for these members and for

00:36:45,130 --> 00:36:49,150
that to be staggered so there aren't all

00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:53,050
new people coming on at once so that

00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:54,790
there are some continuity to clarify its

00:36:53,050 --> 00:36:57,160
process and to ensure that it's

00:36:54,790 --> 00:37:00,610
consistently following it perhaps even

00:36:57,160 --> 00:37:02,830
with some oversight of an ombudsman or a

00:37:00,610 --> 00:37:04,420
watchdog I'm going to use those terms

00:37:02,830 --> 00:37:06,610
interchangeably even though there is

00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:11,820
some distinction there but an ombudsman

00:37:06,610 --> 00:37:15,250
is really someone who is appointed to

00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:19,380
ensure that the government or in this

00:37:15,250 --> 00:37:22,270
case our governance entities are

00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:24,310
following the process and that there is

00:37:22,270 --> 00:37:31,320
a place for any complaints about that

00:37:24,310 --> 00:37:31,320
process to be raised and addressed

00:37:31,790 --> 00:37:37,550
there is a desire for better policy or

00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:41,330
better clarity on what that policy is

00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:42,800
for what evidence and is admissible and

00:37:41,330 --> 00:37:44,390
I'm using these terms because this isn't

00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:47,960
a court but these are the terms that

00:37:44,390 --> 00:37:50,930
people are that they use until I want to

00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:52,400
be true to those terms these are the

00:37:50,930 --> 00:37:57,110
ones we're comfortable with using or

00:37:52,400 --> 00:38:02,810
aware of what can be submitted and what

00:37:57,110 --> 00:38:06,320
is not admissible to a community working

00:38:02,810 --> 00:38:09,200
group case so that we're discouraging

00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:13,790
any information gathering that is

00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:15,770
unethical a real desire for immediate

00:38:13,790 --> 00:38:19,870
and frequent communication with the

00:38:15,770 --> 00:38:21,920
person who is being accused and whom

00:38:19,870 --> 00:38:24,920
complainants are bringing up issues

00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:27,950
about so that they are involved in the

00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:30,380
process and that there be some kind of

00:38:27,950 --> 00:38:33,200
policy around warnings or a probation or

00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:35,780
suspension some kind of interim status

00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:39,560
both for a permanent dismissal from the

00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:41,510
community greater consistency from case

00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:45,710
to case and how the process is followed

00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:49,010
and and inconsistency and how process is

00:38:45,710 --> 00:38:51,080
applied to all parties involved and then

00:38:49,010 --> 00:38:53,960
just greater communication with the

00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:56,060
community throughout but of course and

00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:57,800
this was named many times in sanity

00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:59,560
expressions of course understanding that

00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:03,190
there needs to be a balance between

00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:03,190
transparency and privacy

00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:11,460
as I mentioned there's a proposal for

00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:13,590
the Drupal Association to be a greater

00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:15,780
support in community management to

00:39:13,590 --> 00:39:17,790
perhaps even have a full-time community

00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:21,840
manager that can address issues in real

00:39:17,790 --> 00:39:25,380
time between the Drupal Association has

00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:28,080
resources at its disposal in the way

00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:30,600
that community working group doesn't for

00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:33,330
instance so perhaps the DA could be

00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:35,940
providing access to mediation training

00:39:33,330 --> 00:39:38,420
for its community manager as well as

00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:42,120
members of the community working group a

00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:44,070
desire to see more of these safe spaces

00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:46,200
like the community discussions that

00:39:44,070 --> 00:39:49,320
we've held over the last couple months

00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:52,470
but for the durable Association to have

00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:55,290
more of these so that community members

00:39:52,470 --> 00:39:57,030
can come together regularly to express

00:39:55,290 --> 00:39:59,550
feelings and needs about community

00:39:57,030 --> 00:40:01,980
issues many people who participate in

00:39:59,550 --> 00:40:05,370
this process felt that the nonviolent

00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:07,110
communication or NVC process that we

00:40:05,370 --> 00:40:10,260
utilized was a really healthy and

00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:12,210
helpful one and perhaps for the Drupal

00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:15,890
Association to encourage local

00:40:12,210 --> 00:40:17,850
organizers to follow similar processes

00:40:15,890 --> 00:40:20,460
resources and legal and financial

00:40:17,850 --> 00:40:21,960
protections for the independent

00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:23,250
governing body whether it be the

00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:26,340
community working group or some

00:40:23,250 --> 00:40:28,140
variation thereof which currently does

00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:31,050
not have protections this is a group of

00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:32,910
volunteers that is not under the

00:40:31,050 --> 00:40:34,890
umbrella of the Drupal Association and

00:40:32,910 --> 00:40:38,040
it really leaves those members of the

00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:40,680
community exposed and then just more

00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:43,260
explicit mentoring coaching buddy system

00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:45,420
except are available for community

00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:48,870
members so that we can remain connected

00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:52,470
and ensure that people are getting their

00:40:48,870 --> 00:40:55,190
needs met as as they become active and

00:40:52,470 --> 00:40:57,480
engage members of the Drupal community

00:40:55,190 --> 00:40:59,760
we do we use have a question would you

00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:02,400
want to eat questions as you go or go

00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:04,290
ahead please okay this comes from Chris

00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:06,930
it says concerning admissible evidence

00:41:04,290 --> 00:41:09,990
quote/unquote where do we set the line

00:41:06,930 --> 00:41:11,880
between what someone's private life as

00:41:09,990 --> 00:41:13,710
long as it's legal and what concerns the

00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:15,180
community

00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:18,000
thank you for that question and remind

00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:20,790
me who asked that question it is Chris

00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:23,970
thank you Chris I really appreciate that

00:41:20,790 --> 00:41:26,099
question and that is exactly it so I

00:41:23,970 --> 00:41:27,780
can't answer that but that is exactly

00:41:26,099 --> 00:41:30,480
the question that the community is

00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:33,690
holding right now what is appropriate

00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:35,849
information to bring forward to the

00:41:33,690 --> 00:41:37,830
community working group the community

00:41:35,849 --> 00:41:40,650
working group perhaps I'm going to go

00:41:37,830 --> 00:41:44,010
back a slide perhaps needs to have a

00:41:40,650 --> 00:41:46,589
better and clearer policy on what

00:41:44,010 --> 00:41:50,010
information they are willing to look at

00:41:46,589 --> 00:41:52,890
and if any information that they receive

00:41:50,010 --> 00:41:54,869
about a community member does not fit

00:41:52,890 --> 00:41:59,420
that policy than it needs to be

00:41:54,869 --> 00:42:04,290
disregarded and not brought into their

00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:07,310
deliberation process so there is

00:42:04,290 --> 00:42:11,849
certainly a question about private

00:42:07,310 --> 00:42:14,790
information personal versus public there

00:42:11,849 --> 00:42:17,940
is a question about and this will be

00:42:14,790 --> 00:42:21,660
noted again in the open questions when

00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:25,380
is someone representing the Drupal

00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:27,990
community is it only in Drupal related

00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:31,080
spaces and what are drupal spaces

00:42:27,990 --> 00:42:33,810
because the Drupal ecosystem continues

00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:37,770
to expand yes we have the issue choose

00:42:33,810 --> 00:42:40,560
we have activity on d0 specifically you

00:42:37,770 --> 00:42:42,630
can argue that's admissible because it's

00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:46,410
happening right there on an entity that

00:42:42,630 --> 00:42:50,400
is governed by is managed by the Drupal

00:42:46,410 --> 00:42:54,359
Association so that's very concrete but

00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:58,820
what about IR City what about slack what

00:42:54,359 --> 00:43:02,160
about Twitter what about other

00:42:58,820 --> 00:43:05,220
communities where perhaps people are

00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:06,359
also involved other developer

00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:08,780
communities for instance where they're

00:43:06,359 --> 00:43:11,880
also involved but they're known to be

00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:15,200
Drupal community members as well you

00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:15,200
know there's so many

00:43:15,369 --> 00:43:21,309
subtlety's around this issue of

00:43:18,099 --> 00:43:22,960
community and what the Drupal ecosystem

00:43:21,309 --> 00:43:26,230
really is and where it extends itself

00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:29,849
and where it doesn't that it contributes

00:43:26,230 --> 00:43:33,940
to this question of what is ethical

00:43:29,849 --> 00:43:38,289
information to bring forward in a cwg

00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:42,569
case and is that personal information is

00:43:38,289 --> 00:43:46,779
a information that's findable online

00:43:42,569 --> 00:43:49,539
admissible should it be if it's publicly

00:43:46,779 --> 00:43:51,910
available online but it wasn't brought

00:43:49,539 --> 00:43:54,640
into the Drupal community is that fair

00:43:51,910 --> 00:43:56,200
game or is it not so there's all sorts

00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:58,660
of questions about this Chris and I'm

00:43:56,200 --> 00:44:00,220
glad that you're raising it no good

00:43:58,660 --> 00:44:02,380
answers right now but there's a real

00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:06,910
need for the community to come together

00:44:02,380 --> 00:44:10,569
and put some policy around this so thank

00:44:06,910 --> 00:44:13,059
you I'm going to move on now to

00:44:10,569 --> 00:44:16,809
community elected leadership positions

00:44:13,059 --> 00:44:18,999
there are a couple community elected

00:44:16,809 --> 00:44:21,339
members of the Drupal Association board

00:44:18,999 --> 00:44:24,279
today but there's a real desire for more

00:44:21,339 --> 00:44:27,160
and a desire to see greater

00:44:24,279 --> 00:44:29,650
decentralization of power across the

00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:31,930
Drupal community because this is an open

00:44:29,650 --> 00:44:34,690
source project and people really want to

00:44:31,930 --> 00:44:37,359
see policies and practices that are in

00:44:34,690 --> 00:44:41,049
alignment with the philosophy of open

00:44:37,359 --> 00:44:44,650
source but of course we're growing leaps

00:44:41,049 --> 00:44:47,769
and bounds and we're also one of the

00:44:44,650 --> 00:44:50,170
largest if not the largest open source

00:44:47,769 --> 00:44:52,599
community in the world so there does

00:44:50,170 --> 00:44:54,730
need to be some formality there are

00:44:52,599 --> 00:44:56,589
going to need to be people in leadership

00:44:54,730 --> 00:44:59,410
positions so that there's more

00:44:56,589 --> 00:45:01,450
accountability and more structure that

00:44:59,410 --> 00:45:04,180
structure does need to be there but

00:45:01,450 --> 00:45:06,930
people are proposing more community

00:45:04,180 --> 00:45:10,480
elected leadership positions and that

00:45:06,930 --> 00:45:13,410
there be a community elected group to

00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:16,749
manage community spirits maybe this is

00:45:13,410 --> 00:45:17,890
escalated to a trained set of members of

00:45:16,749 --> 00:45:20,079
the community working group or maybe

00:45:17,890 --> 00:45:22,450
this is the community working group but

00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:24,730
that there be more elected roles rather

00:45:22,450 --> 00:45:26,950
than only appointed roles and as I

00:45:24,730 --> 00:45:29,230
mentioned some kind of Ombudsman

00:45:26,950 --> 00:45:31,840
watchdog that can field

00:45:29,230 --> 00:45:34,690
concerns about mismanagement that is

00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:39,550
happening in any leadership roles across

00:45:34,690 --> 00:45:42,760
the project then kind of a riff visiting

00:45:39,550 --> 00:45:45,490
is a soft way of putting it or perhaps

00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:46,180
even a consolidation of the codes of

00:45:45,490 --> 00:45:48,700
conduct

00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:51,390
there is the Drupal code of conduct and

00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:54,220
there is a Drupal con code of conduct

00:45:51,390 --> 00:45:56,800
people want to see a real valuation of

00:45:54,220 --> 00:45:58,630
the need for both on the one hand the

00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:00,880
Drupal code of conduct is created by the

00:45:58,630 --> 00:46:03,520
community on the other the Drupal con

00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:06,790
code of conduct is a really more of a

00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:08,650
legal document that is part of the

00:46:06,790 --> 00:46:11,380
Drupal Association because the truthful

00:46:08,650 --> 00:46:14,050
Association organizes and facilitates

00:46:11,380 --> 00:46:16,150
Drupal cons so there is some distinction

00:46:14,050 --> 00:46:16,990
there but what is the distinction do we

00:46:16,150 --> 00:46:19,510
need both

00:46:16,990 --> 00:46:22,210
should they be consolidated or revisited

00:46:19,510 --> 00:46:26,380
in some way there's a real desire for

00:46:22,210 --> 00:46:29,920
greater specificity on what the expected

00:46:26,380 --> 00:46:34,990
behaviors are of Drupal community

00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:38,140
members in various Drupal spaces and how

00:46:34,990 --> 00:46:41,460
those policies are applied and what the

00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:50,470
consequences are when they're there is

00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:53,830
any kind of discrepancy or questioning

00:46:50,470 --> 00:47:00,010
about whether those policies are being

00:46:53,830 --> 00:47:02,640
violated clarity on people's personal

00:47:00,010 --> 00:47:04,869
beliefs versus their behaviors and

00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:08,680
really drawing that clear distinction

00:47:04,869 --> 00:47:11,710
and ensuring that people understand

00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:14,500
which we're referring to here when we

00:47:11,710 --> 00:47:17,590
talk about a code of conduct and when we

00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:20,830
specify these behaviors greater

00:47:17,590 --> 00:47:22,540
explicitness for the higher standards

00:47:20,830 --> 00:47:24,760
perhaps with people that are in

00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:26,320
leadership roles and local organizers

00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:29,710
are included in that as well

00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:32,140
and as Chris brought up that greater

00:47:29,710 --> 00:47:35,020
explicitness on when the code of conduct

00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:38,170
is applicable to personalize and non

00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:42,369
Drupal spaces but what what do we mean

00:47:38,170 --> 00:47:43,060
when someone is in an entrepreneurial

00:47:42,369 --> 00:47:46,540
community or

00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:49,660
we need clarity around that there was

00:47:46,540 --> 00:47:52,150
more so than a desire to revise the code

00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:55,150
of conduct there was really a big call

00:47:52,150 --> 00:47:58,510
for a companion document to the Code of

00:47:55,150 --> 00:48:00,790
Conduct that is around our core values

00:47:58,510 --> 00:48:02,650
as a community this would be defining

00:48:00,790 --> 00:48:05,380
the kind of community that we want to be

00:48:02,650 --> 00:48:08,890
with a global mindset meaning this is

00:48:05,380 --> 00:48:11,380
not solely North American or Western

00:48:08,890 --> 00:48:13,600
values that is not the intention here at

00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:15,100
all it really is to ensure that we're

00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:17,440
looking at this from a global

00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:19,240
perspective and have full awareness that

00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:22,270
these are the values of the global

00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:24,850
Drupal community and it would allow us

00:48:22,270 --> 00:48:28,660
to align our community members with the

00:48:24,850 --> 00:48:30,730
purpose of the Drupal project it would

00:48:28,660 --> 00:48:33,520
need to create space for different

00:48:30,730 --> 00:48:35,830
values because we are all individuals

00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:38,770
who hold our own values come from our

00:48:35,830 --> 00:48:40,720
own families of origin and cultures and

00:48:38,770 --> 00:48:43,600
those do have different values so it

00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:45,970
means be rigid or restrictive it does

00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:48,280
need to be open and flexible but still

00:48:45,970 --> 00:48:51,820
have some kind of definition around it

00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:55,420
and also a recognition that if we define

00:48:51,820 --> 00:48:57,670
our core values that there may be people

00:48:55,420 --> 00:48:59,380
who do not feel aligned with those

00:48:57,670 --> 00:49:03,040
values and may choose to leave the

00:48:59,380 --> 00:49:05,260
community and this is a direct statement

00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:08,680
that the Drupal culture encourages

00:49:05,260 --> 00:49:11,290
collective ownership and individual

00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:13,750
contribution and empowerment so how can

00:49:11,290 --> 00:49:17,860
we create some form of documentation

00:49:13,750 --> 00:49:20,590
that defines what that collective is but

00:49:17,860 --> 00:49:24,280
still we've space for that individuality

00:49:20,590 --> 00:49:26,110
and again when we onboard new community

00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:30,490
members when new community members join

00:49:26,110 --> 00:49:33,190
the community to give them some clarity

00:49:30,490 --> 00:49:35,650
and around what is expected of them and

00:49:33,190 --> 00:49:37,810
to confirm the understanding of

00:49:35,650 --> 00:49:41,470
expectations because we cannot expect

00:49:37,810 --> 00:49:44,470
people to abide by codes of conduct and

00:49:41,470 --> 00:49:46,720
align with core values if they haven't

00:49:44,470 --> 00:49:51,480
been made aware of them

00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:53,829
and then lastly there is a call for a

00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:56,380
governance summit which is something

00:49:53,829 --> 00:49:59,800
that occurred many years ago but it's

00:49:56,380 --> 00:50:02,380
been some time a call for a governance

00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:05,140
summit to convene to craft revisions to

00:50:02,380 --> 00:50:07,780
community governance that this really

00:50:05,140 --> 00:50:09,339
must remain a community driven bottom-up

00:50:07,780 --> 00:50:11,050
approach with the community in the

00:50:09,339 --> 00:50:13,329
driver seat not the Drupal Association

00:50:11,050 --> 00:50:15,970
not trees not the community working

00:50:13,329 --> 00:50:18,250
group or anyone else there's a question

00:50:15,970 --> 00:50:20,260
about who participates in the government

00:50:18,250 --> 00:50:23,710
summit is it an open invitation and

00:50:20,260 --> 00:50:27,490
anyone can apply anyone can just sign up

00:50:23,710 --> 00:50:29,619
register where is it invite only and a

00:50:27,490 --> 00:50:30,670
real desire to consult with people

00:50:29,619 --> 00:50:34,089
who've done things like this before

00:50:30,670 --> 00:50:36,040
other open-source communities backdrop

00:50:34,089 --> 00:50:38,740
and it's project management community

00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:42,599
based decision making under represented

00:50:38,740 --> 00:50:46,390
communities who need to be more active

00:50:42,599 --> 00:50:50,410
role in crafting these revisions as well

00:50:46,390 --> 00:50:52,990
and then for a draft plan that it comes

00:50:50,410 --> 00:50:57,190
out of this covering summit to be shared

00:50:52,990 --> 00:50:59,859
with the community at large globally for

00:50:57,190 --> 00:51:02,829
comment and approval and then some form

00:50:59,859 --> 00:51:04,450
of game plan for its implementation so

00:51:02,829 --> 00:51:07,720
that's a lot I know it's a lot that

00:51:04,450 --> 00:51:10,060
these worthy all of the potential

00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:13,780
strategies that were proposed through

00:51:10,060 --> 00:51:15,210
these community discussions so some open

00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:17,859
questions that I've already touched upon

00:51:15,210 --> 00:51:19,690
what do we mean when we say community so

00:51:17,859 --> 00:51:22,270
what is community and we really need to

00:51:19,690 --> 00:51:25,119
define this so that we're using it

00:51:22,270 --> 00:51:28,510
accurately and consistently who is a

00:51:25,119 --> 00:51:32,560
Drupal community member and who isn't so

00:51:28,510 --> 00:51:35,140
is anyone who uses Drupal as a platform

00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:38,040
at their work or they automatically a

00:51:35,140 --> 00:51:42,460
community member or is it someone who

00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:45,400
has a DDOT o profile or is it someone

00:51:42,460 --> 00:51:47,500
who pays the Drupal Association for

00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:50,589
regular membership who is its community

00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:54,670
member what is the dividing line between

00:51:50,589 --> 00:51:57,640
the project in the community if we're

00:51:54,670 --> 00:51:59,900
going to have more elected roles than

00:51:57,640 --> 00:52:03,140
how is a democratic

00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:07,490
and if so who is eligible to vote who is

00:52:03,140 --> 00:52:10,339
eligible to run for that position should

00:52:07,490 --> 00:52:13,640
voting be for a specific individual or

00:52:10,339 --> 00:52:16,430
should it be for what one participant

00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:19,700
called a role profile meaning should we

00:52:16,430 --> 00:52:22,160
have a profile of the kind of person

00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:24,950
that we need in this leadership role

00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:27,140
their qualifications their education

00:52:24,950 --> 00:52:30,200
their experience and should we be voting

00:52:27,140 --> 00:52:31,609
on that and then appointing someone

00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:35,509
within the community who fits that

00:52:31,609 --> 00:52:39,499
profile for instance when is someone

00:52:35,509 --> 00:52:41,450
representing Drupal outside of specific

00:52:39,499 --> 00:52:43,130
Drupal activities and spaces and when

00:52:41,450 --> 00:52:46,069
are they not even if they are a member

00:52:43,130 --> 00:52:49,579
of the Drupal community when is the code

00:52:46,069 --> 00:52:52,009
of conduct not in violation but an issue

00:52:49,579 --> 00:52:54,289
is remaining unresolved what happens

00:52:52,009 --> 00:52:57,980
before escalation what's the process

00:52:54,289 --> 00:53:00,680
what are the policies and there are many

00:52:57,980 --> 00:53:02,509
Drupal communities plural I've been

00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:04,039
saying the Drupal community this whole

00:53:02,509 --> 00:53:06,079
time in that the turn of phrase that

00:53:04,039 --> 00:53:09,710
many of us use but there are many

00:53:06,079 --> 00:53:12,289
communities how can we take more of a

00:53:09,710 --> 00:53:14,509
global perspective how can we have

00:53:12,289 --> 00:53:17,809
processes and policies that work for all

00:53:14,509 --> 00:53:24,319
of our communities globally consistently

00:53:17,809 --> 00:53:26,239
and fairly so our next steps to moving

00:53:24,319 --> 00:53:30,349
this forward to addressing these needs

00:53:26,239 --> 00:53:34,309
to evaluating these proposals and

00:53:30,349 --> 00:53:38,150
strategies is as follows firstly we are

00:53:34,309 --> 00:53:40,640
about to deploy a community survey on

00:53:38,150 --> 00:53:43,009
the governance summit to have the

00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:46,309
community input on how this governance

00:53:43,009 --> 00:53:49,190
summit works who facilitates what it

00:53:46,309 --> 00:53:53,450
entails who pit participates etc and

00:53:49,190 --> 00:53:55,160
that will be coming shortly so be on the

00:53:53,450 --> 00:53:57,739
lookout for that we definitely want your

00:53:55,160 --> 00:54:00,200
participation in that survey there's

00:53:57,739 --> 00:54:02,180
also going to be some form of online

00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:04,069
suggestion box that we're going to put

00:54:02,180 --> 00:54:05,960
up for ongoing community feedback so

00:54:04,069 --> 00:54:07,819
that this is not the end of it we want

00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:10,489
this to be the beginning of the process

00:54:07,819 --> 00:54:13,530
for the community to make itself known

00:54:10,489 --> 00:54:16,320
we will allow anonymous submissions

00:54:13,530 --> 00:54:18,780
there will be a neutral third party so

00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:20,760
who is monitoring this so that the

00:54:18,780 --> 00:54:22,680
comments are not going to be about that

00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:25,140
person and they will be servicing the

00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:27,240
themes rather than sending every single

00:54:25,140 --> 00:54:28,950
comment and they'll be sharing those

00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:31,650
themes with the community working group

00:54:28,950 --> 00:54:33,630
and Drupal Association staff for now so

00:54:31,650 --> 00:54:36,150
that we can ensure that that feedback is

00:54:33,630 --> 00:54:38,100
being heard we will share the findings

00:54:36,150 --> 00:54:40,920
from the survey on the covenants summit

00:54:38,100 --> 00:54:43,920
we will propose an approach based on

00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:48,930
those survey findings for the community

00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:50,640
comments I will continue to support the

00:54:48,930 --> 00:54:53,400
coordination and facilitation of the

00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:55,980
governance summit to ensure that we are

00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:58,530
addressing these concerns and we're

00:54:55,980 --> 00:55:01,800
coming up with feasible solutions for

00:54:58,530 --> 00:55:04,230
moving them forward we'll be sharing the

00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:07,020
outcomes for community comment and then

00:55:04,230 --> 00:55:10,890
there may be some kind of community task

00:55:07,020 --> 00:55:15,000
force that gets assembled in some form

00:55:10,890 --> 00:55:17,400
that continues through implementation so

00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:19,830
that the community is taking full

00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:21,930
ownership of the work that ultimately

00:55:19,830 --> 00:55:26,510
needs to be done to evolve community

00:55:21,930 --> 00:55:29,400
governance so it took me a full hour I

00:55:26,510 --> 00:55:32,490
did it as fast as I could but wanted to

00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:35,730
be thorough I appreciate your attention

00:55:32,490 --> 00:55:38,160
and your participation so much thank you

00:55:35,730 --> 00:55:40,860
for listening thank you for being a part

00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:43,260
of these really important discussions

00:55:40,860 --> 00:55:46,400
and this very important process at an

00:55:43,260 --> 00:55:49,530
integral time in the Drupal project

00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:51,870
evolution if you have any questions

00:55:49,530 --> 00:55:53,640
please feel free to put them in the chat

00:55:51,870 --> 00:55:54,810
window and Meagan will read them to me

00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:57,870
and I'll take a few minutes to answer

00:55:54,810 --> 00:55:59,580
those otherwise please feel free to

00:55:57,870 --> 00:56:02,370
email me this is my personal email

00:55:59,580 --> 00:56:04,820
address whitney at Whitney has calm I'm

00:56:02,370 --> 00:56:08,250
happy to answer any of your questions

00:56:04,820 --> 00:56:10,230
privately and will ensure that if there

00:56:08,250 --> 00:56:12,900
is something that I can't answer

00:56:10,230 --> 00:56:16,230
personally that I will bring that to the

00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:18,840
relevant party who can so Meagan do we

00:56:16,230 --> 00:56:20,220
have any questions we do first I just

00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:23,040
want to say thank you with me that was

00:56:20,220 --> 00:56:26,310
really thorough and I think just

00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:27,370
presented in a way it was easy for me to

00:56:26,310 --> 00:56:30,430
understand where we

00:56:27,370 --> 00:56:32,470
focus and where we kind of head next at

00:56:30,430 --> 00:56:33,430
the community I'm happy to hear that

00:56:32,470 --> 00:56:37,060
thank you

00:56:33,430 --> 00:56:38,710
you bet I do have some question so the

00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:40,710
first one comes from George to med it

00:56:38,710 --> 00:56:42,610
has to deal with strategy number six

00:56:40,710 --> 00:56:45,280
Chris had asked a question about

00:56:42,610 --> 00:56:47,410
admissible evidence and you gave it an

00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:49,750
overview of just some areas that needed

00:56:47,410 --> 00:56:51,760
some clarification as it relates to the

00:56:49,750 --> 00:56:55,090
community working group so George submit

00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:58,320
followed up about that and said to what

00:56:55,090 --> 00:57:01,510
extent did you get a sense that this

00:56:58,320 --> 00:57:03,940
issue around admissible evidence with a

00:57:01,510 --> 00:57:06,960
systemic concern versus the perception

00:57:03,940 --> 00:57:11,680
of what happened in a specific case

00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:15,190
thank you I got the impression that this

00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:18,220
is a systemic concern because multiple

00:57:15,190 --> 00:57:22,600
cases has been named around this issue

00:57:18,220 --> 00:57:25,150
it is a perception certainly only

00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:28,630
members of the community working group

00:57:25,150 --> 00:57:31,810
can know for certain what information

00:57:28,630 --> 00:57:33,850
they're accepting and using in their

00:57:31,810 --> 00:57:37,180
deliberations and what they aren't but

00:57:33,850 --> 00:57:41,500
there certainly is a perception that a

00:57:37,180 --> 00:57:46,990
lack of clarity around the policy on

00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:50,950
what is acceptable invites unacceptable

00:57:46,990 --> 00:57:53,740
and perhaps unethical information to be

00:57:50,950 --> 00:57:56,380
shared and there is concern that if that

00:57:53,740 --> 00:57:59,440
information is being submitted that it

00:57:56,380 --> 00:58:01,540
may very well be used by members of the

00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:03,940
community working group to make their

00:58:01,540 --> 00:58:06,600
decisions does that answer your question

00:58:03,940 --> 00:58:06,600
George

00:58:06,940 --> 00:58:09,000
you

00:58:10,319 --> 00:58:16,089
just watching the chat I don't see a

00:58:12,819 --> 00:58:18,700
response but we'll make sure if you guys

00:58:16,089 --> 00:58:20,319
have more okay used to put in the chat

00:58:18,700 --> 00:58:23,410
window George and anyone else to those

00:58:20,319 --> 00:58:27,249
questions please do the same we do have

00:58:23,410 --> 00:58:31,049
a it's kind of a an opportunity and

00:58:27,249 --> 00:58:34,749
there's a question in here too so Joseph

00:58:31,049 --> 00:58:37,960
who is part of the Austrian community is

00:58:34,749 --> 00:58:39,130
doing a lot of work that local community

00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:43,890
is doing a lot of work to help us with

00:58:39,130 --> 00:58:47,499
Drupal con Vienna and as many know we

00:58:43,890 --> 00:58:50,380
opted for various reasons some of it

00:58:47,499 --> 00:58:51,999
being financial that not the lack of

00:58:50,380 --> 00:58:57,069
demand for trainings on Monday just to

00:58:51,999 --> 00:59:00,819
not do in a Drupal con trainings that

00:58:57,069 --> 00:59:03,130
Monday create a nice you could say hole

00:59:00,819 --> 00:59:04,809
in our schedule we're going to keep with

00:59:03,130 --> 00:59:06,640
the Drupal con is from Tuesday Wednesday

00:59:04,809 --> 00:59:10,240
Thursday the main conference but this

00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:14,109
one day we won't be having any program

00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:15,789
programming and the the local community

00:59:14,109 --> 00:59:20,619
has stepped in it is creating some

00:59:15,789 --> 00:59:22,329
really great summits and other community

00:59:20,619 --> 00:59:23,589
programs that day and it's all being led

00:59:22,329 --> 00:59:25,720
by the community which i think is

00:59:23,589 --> 00:59:30,099
exciting and I'm really pleased to see

00:59:25,720 --> 00:59:32,980
this happening and Joseph just asked is

00:59:30,099 --> 00:59:34,720
does it make sense to use some of the

00:59:32,980 --> 00:59:37,599
facilities that they've found for Monday

00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:39,099
to hold community discussions and you

00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:41,410
know it just being nice to hear from you

00:59:39,099 --> 00:59:43,329
Whitney what you would recommend that

00:59:41,410 --> 00:59:45,849
the focus would be how it gets

00:59:43,329 --> 00:59:47,440
facilitated and right now we don't we

00:59:45,849 --> 00:59:48,910
were able to have you come to Drupal con

00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:52,029
Baltimore but we don't have you coming

00:59:48,910 --> 00:59:54,940
to Drupal con Vienna it just would love

00:59:52,029 --> 00:59:56,470
to hear if you had any ideas or you know

00:59:54,940 --> 00:59:57,940
and of course if you need more time but

00:59:56,470 --> 01:00:00,460
I just want to put it out there that

00:59:57,940 --> 01:00:02,710
they're here the need and people are

01:00:00,460 --> 01:00:05,049
kind of thing they want to address it

01:00:02,710 --> 01:00:08,079
not sure how to do it yeah Thank You

01:00:05,049 --> 01:00:12,670
Megan and Thank You Joseph I am so

01:00:08,079 --> 01:00:15,789
heartened by what the local community is

01:00:12,670 --> 01:00:20,140
doing to come together and that there is

01:00:15,789 --> 01:00:22,970
such a strong desire to facilitate these

01:00:20,140 --> 01:00:26,060
community discussions locally I

01:00:22,970 --> 01:00:30,020
feel strongly that that can only be a

01:00:26,060 --> 01:00:32,450
positive thing my intention my personal

01:00:30,020 --> 01:00:36,470
intention that I held in each one of

01:00:32,450 --> 01:00:40,220
those sessions was to do everything I

01:00:36,470 --> 01:00:43,640
could to help people feel heard and

01:00:40,220 --> 01:00:47,570
understood that is part of the healing

01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:50,660
process and that's part of progress so I

01:00:47,570 --> 01:00:53,300
feel strongly that holding community

01:00:50,660 --> 01:00:56,240
discussions whether it's in the format

01:00:53,300 --> 01:00:58,580
that we used which I can go into greater

01:00:56,240 --> 01:01:01,550
depth on and Joseph you and I are in

01:00:58,580 --> 01:01:03,610
contact so we can talk about that

01:01:01,550 --> 01:01:06,050
specifically and I can give you some

01:01:03,610 --> 01:01:08,300
structure that I used for those

01:01:06,050 --> 01:01:11,320
discussions so perhaps you can have

01:01:08,300 --> 01:01:14,750
those community set discussions in

01:01:11,320 --> 01:01:18,310
Europe mirror the ones that we held at

01:01:14,750 --> 01:01:21,740
Baltimore and online or they can be

01:01:18,310 --> 01:01:24,890
looser and less structured and not using

01:01:21,740 --> 01:01:27,020
the nonviolent communication ground

01:01:24,890 --> 01:01:29,480
rules that I have set up if you so

01:01:27,020 --> 01:01:33,080
choose but just provide an open space

01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:35,210
where people can share you may want to

01:01:33,080 --> 01:01:38,090
bring some of these findings into that

01:01:35,210 --> 01:01:40,250
space so that you can confirm where

01:01:38,090 --> 01:01:43,220
there's agreement with what we've

01:01:40,250 --> 01:01:44,930
already discovered and identify where

01:01:43,220 --> 01:01:47,120
there isn't that would be greatly

01:01:44,930 --> 01:01:49,910
helpful to me to the Drupal Association

01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:53,360
and to the community at large as well so

01:01:49,910 --> 01:01:55,760
let's definitely continue to discuss it

01:01:53,360 --> 01:01:58,490
we have a little bit of time I

01:01:55,760 --> 01:02:00,890
unfortunately will not be there due to

01:01:58,490 --> 01:02:05,150
scheduling and other logistical issues

01:02:00,890 --> 01:02:09,620
but I still can play an active role in

01:02:05,150 --> 01:02:11,780
helping you to make these sessions as

01:02:09,620 --> 01:02:13,580
effective as possible if you are

01:02:11,780 --> 01:02:17,720
interested in having me play that role

01:02:13,580 --> 01:02:20,300
so again it's really up to you I think I

01:02:17,720 --> 01:02:25,870
hope that's enough of an answer for now

01:02:20,300 --> 01:02:25,870
but let's keep discussing it separately

01:02:26,710 --> 01:02:31,810
Joseph this is Megan speaking I just

01:02:28,869 --> 01:02:33,280
want to thank you as well for hearing

01:02:31,810 --> 01:02:34,960
the need and wanting to create a

01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:38,290
solution and I looked a partner with you

01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:40,330
on that so let's make sure we talk

01:02:38,290 --> 01:02:42,460
afterwards I'd love to see a community

01:02:40,330 --> 01:02:44,530
discussion at DrupalCon and I heard from

01:02:42,460 --> 01:02:46,540
the research that having that on a

01:02:44,530 --> 01:02:48,220
regular basis that Drupal cons would add

01:02:46,540 --> 01:02:50,320
a lot of value to the community so I

01:02:48,220 --> 01:02:56,460
hear that myself and would love to to

01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:56,460
participate great um one other question

01:02:56,670 --> 01:03:01,570
oh good thank you Chris Chris just said

01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:02,920
thank you for this much needed and

01:03:01,570 --> 01:03:04,780
healthy discussion in which I felt

01:03:02,920 --> 01:03:06,040
comfortable putting in my two cents when

01:03:04,780 --> 01:03:08,410
I was afraid of being judged by

01:03:06,040 --> 01:03:11,470
commented in Drupal at work it's really

01:03:08,410 --> 01:03:13,540
great we're yeah if you want to dress

01:03:11,470 --> 01:03:17,349
that Whitney just thank you that's

01:03:13,540 --> 01:03:20,650
fantastic and yes there were many people

01:03:17,349 --> 01:03:24,849
who came to me privately who felt that

01:03:20,650 --> 01:03:27,940
they didn't it wouldn't be the best

01:03:24,849 --> 01:03:31,240
strategy for them to participate in

01:03:27,940 --> 01:03:33,250
these community discussions or to share

01:03:31,240 --> 01:03:35,320
their thoughts online and in the variety

01:03:33,250 --> 01:03:38,619
of forms that were available to them and

01:03:35,320 --> 01:03:40,750
I respect and understand that it's not

01:03:38,619 --> 01:03:43,750
the right strategy for everyone which is

01:03:40,750 --> 01:03:46,240
why I've continued to post my personal

01:03:43,750 --> 01:03:49,450
email on the communications that we've

01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:52,270
had so far the the formal blog posts

01:03:49,450 --> 01:03:54,250
about this process and it's here as well

01:03:52,270 --> 01:03:56,530
and I will continue to post it I really

01:03:54,250 --> 01:03:58,180
do encourage people to reach out to me

01:03:56,530 --> 01:04:01,089
privately if that's the better strategy

01:03:58,180 --> 01:04:04,570
for them to share their feelings needs

01:04:01,089 --> 01:04:06,339
off ideas as they arrive but I am

01:04:04,570 --> 01:04:09,040
grateful to hear Chris that you felt

01:04:06,339 --> 01:04:11,360
that you could do that in this space so

01:04:09,040 --> 01:04:13,190
thank you very much

01:04:11,360 --> 01:04:14,660
I just want to plant on he does have a

01:04:13,190 --> 01:04:16,670
question I just scrolled back and found

01:04:14,660 --> 01:04:20,390
one start off that Chris so let's make

01:04:16,670 --> 01:04:21,950
sure we address it this question is when

01:04:20,390 --> 01:04:24,320
does a person represent the Drupal

01:04:21,950 --> 01:04:26,060
community I think they'll never be a

01:04:24,320 --> 01:04:28,970
definitive answer to this as the

01:04:26,060 --> 01:04:30,530
communities worldwide I am American but

01:04:28,970 --> 01:04:32,330
living in France for the past 15 years

01:04:30,530 --> 01:04:34,660
I've learned that different cultures to

01:04:32,330 --> 01:04:37,490
find privacy based on their environment

01:04:34,660 --> 01:04:40,070
it gives an example that many folks up

01:04:37,490 --> 01:04:41,720
five the USA that I've met have a hard

01:04:40,070 --> 01:04:43,880
time understand the reasons why

01:04:41,720 --> 01:04:46,130
President Clinton was impeached as

01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:48,680
basically based on concerns in his

01:04:46,130 --> 01:04:50,600
private life as a member of government

01:04:48,680 --> 01:04:52,280
whatever a person does will always

01:04:50,600 --> 01:04:54,320
affect the community at large and how

01:04:52,280 --> 01:04:56,840
it's being viewed I think the only thing

01:04:54,320 --> 01:04:58,370
we can do is to limit the impact it can

01:04:56,840 --> 01:05:00,140
have on the community so again his

01:04:58,370 --> 01:05:02,570
question is when does a person represent

01:05:00,140 --> 01:05:05,030
the Drupal community yeah thank you

01:05:02,570 --> 01:05:08,570
Chris again this is a question that many

01:05:05,030 --> 01:05:10,430
people are holding right now and there's

01:05:08,570 --> 01:05:16,100
a real desire to come together as a

01:05:10,430 --> 01:05:18,680
community to answer it so with a project

01:05:16,100 --> 01:05:23,180
and a community that is as pervasive as

01:05:18,680 --> 01:05:26,210
ours and in living in the world of

01:05:23,180 --> 01:05:28,360
technology that is as pervasive as the

01:05:26,210 --> 01:05:32,990
one that we're living in it infiltrates

01:05:28,360 --> 01:05:36,080
everything and so what is that boundary

01:05:32,990 --> 01:05:39,170
line when someone who is a contributing

01:05:36,080 --> 01:05:44,180
member of the Drupal community is in a

01:05:39,170 --> 01:05:46,760
non Drupal space and are they still a

01:05:44,180 --> 01:05:50,210
representative of Drupal because they

01:05:46,760 --> 01:05:54,170
contribute to Drupal or if they're in a

01:05:50,210 --> 01:05:58,360
leadership role in Drupal and they're in

01:05:54,170 --> 01:06:01,000
a social environment that is not related

01:05:58,360 --> 01:06:04,280
whatsoever to Drupal or even other

01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:06,770
professional pursuits of theirs are they

01:06:04,280 --> 01:06:09,560
still a representative of Drupal in that

01:06:06,770 --> 01:06:11,660
social space these are really tough

01:06:09,560 --> 01:06:15,110
questions they're questions that we are

01:06:11,660 --> 01:06:18,140
certainly not the only community that is

01:06:15,110 --> 01:06:20,180
grappling with but we need to come up

01:06:18,140 --> 01:06:23,650
with some answers that are good enough

01:06:20,180 --> 01:06:26,080
for us for now

01:06:23,650 --> 01:06:27,690
going to say that again good enough for

01:06:26,080 --> 01:06:30,640
us for now

01:06:27,690 --> 01:06:33,070
they're not going to be perfect they're

01:06:30,640 --> 01:06:35,800
not going to be for everyone and they're

01:06:33,070 --> 01:06:38,890
not going to be forever but we need to

01:06:35,800 --> 01:06:41,620
come up with something that we can move

01:06:38,890 --> 01:06:45,370
forward with and I do believe that that

01:06:41,620 --> 01:06:50,580
will be a big part of what is discussed

01:06:45,370 --> 01:06:53,590
at the community governance summit and

01:06:50,580 --> 01:06:56,590
there will be perhaps a proposal for

01:06:53,590 --> 01:06:59,920
some definition around this that will

01:06:56,590 --> 01:07:03,130
then we'll seek approval from the larger

01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:05,390
community so that we can define a

01:07:03,130 --> 01:07:07,110
documented

01:07:05,390 --> 01:07:09,210
you

01:07:07,110 --> 01:07:11,010
that's great thanks Whitney does anyone

01:07:09,210 --> 01:07:13,260
have any other questions if so please

01:07:11,010 --> 01:07:17,370
add them in the chat right now it looks

01:07:13,260 --> 01:07:20,930
like we are out of questions okay

01:07:17,370 --> 01:07:24,570
Thank You Megan thank you everyone who

01:07:20,930 --> 01:07:27,780
took the time out of your day to be here

01:07:24,570 --> 01:07:30,150
thank you to everyone who participated

01:07:27,780 --> 01:07:33,060
in these community discussions thank you

01:07:30,150 --> 01:07:36,210
to those of you who had one-on-one

01:07:33,060 --> 01:07:39,990
interviews with me thank you to those

01:07:36,210 --> 01:07:42,090
who are participating in your own areas

01:07:39,990 --> 01:07:44,790
of the community in these discussions to

01:07:42,090 --> 01:07:47,370
move these issues forward and thank you

01:07:44,790 --> 01:07:51,300
to those who are watching this video at

01:07:47,370 --> 01:07:53,250
a later date I'm so grateful for the

01:07:51,300 --> 01:07:54,750
participation and the engagement of

01:07:53,250 --> 01:07:57,840
everyone in this community

01:07:54,750 --> 01:08:01,170
it certainly has made my job in this

01:07:57,840 --> 01:08:04,370
role much easier and really an

01:08:01,170 --> 01:08:07,670
incredible learning experience for me so

01:08:04,370 --> 01:08:09,870
thank you and thank you again Megan for

01:08:07,670 --> 01:08:11,550
allowing me to participate and

01:08:09,870 --> 01:08:12,410
contribute to the Drupal community in

01:08:11,550 --> 01:08:15,300
this way

01:08:12,410 --> 01:08:18,060
well I think we're all benefiting from

01:08:15,300 --> 01:08:20,880
it so thank you with me all right and

01:08:18,060 --> 01:08:23,700
with that and I will conclude and then

01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:24,720
I'll work on posting the recording for

01:08:23,700 --> 01:08:27,089
the rest of the community to see

01:08:24,720 --> 01:08:28,830
wonderful and I do want to make this

01:08:27,089 --> 01:08:30,660
clear that yes we're posting the

01:08:28,830 --> 01:08:34,140
recording and we will also have a

01:08:30,660 --> 01:08:36,290
transcript so we want these findings and

01:08:34,140 --> 01:08:39,780
the explanation of the findings to be as

01:08:36,290 --> 01:08:42,750
widely accessible as possible so be on

01:08:39,780 --> 01:08:43,549
the lookout for that transcript coming

01:08:42,750 --> 01:08:46,859
soon

01:08:43,549 --> 01:08:50,150
wonderful thanks again Whitney thank you
