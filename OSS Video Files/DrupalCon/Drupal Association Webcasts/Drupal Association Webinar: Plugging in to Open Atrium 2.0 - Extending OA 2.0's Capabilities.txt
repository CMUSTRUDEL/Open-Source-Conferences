open atrium solution architect and I

00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:35,280

Mike's presentation but also at the end

00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:17,100

post webinar survey we hope that you

00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:22,860
will just tell us what you thought of

00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:24,960
the content today and let the Drupal

00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:27,509
Association know what other webinar

00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:30,240
topics you'd like us to cover and also

00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:31,829
it's an opportunity for you to say yes

00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,659
I'd love to have more information about

00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:35,939
open atrium or have somewhat phase to

00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:38,549
contact me we don't share contact

00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:40,009
information unless you request it so I

00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:42,960
just wanted to make sure that was

00:01:40,009 --> 00:01:45,930
understood because we respect people's

00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,340
privacy so before I get into the

00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:48,540
presentation for the day I just wanted

00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:52,619
to tell you a little bit about the

00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:55,079
Drupal Association so our role is to

00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:58,110
foster and support the Drupal community

00:01:55,079 --> 00:02:00,960
and we do this in a lot of different

00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:04,500
ways first and foremost our role is to

00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:08,550
support and improve drupal.org so that

00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:11,190
ranges from the hosting for the proper

00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:13,370
org or we are actually starting to build

00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:16,040
out a technical team

00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:17,900
is going to be making improvements to

00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:20,030
the site making it easier for developers

00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:22,099
to collaborate site builders to find

00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:24,080
their modules and just support the life

00:02:22,099 --> 00:02:28,700
cycle of everyone that's coming together

00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:31,069
to build the project we also run Drupal

00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:32,659
cons one in North America one in Europe

00:02:31,069 --> 00:02:36,379
and we'll start doing some more in other

00:02:32,659 --> 00:02:39,049
regions and so obviously this is just a

00:02:36,379 --> 00:02:40,579
great event that brings people together

00:02:39,049 --> 00:02:42,230
in person

00:02:40,579 --> 00:02:45,019
it helps accelerate the project through

00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:46,970
code sprints we have a lot of community

00:02:45,019 --> 00:02:48,980
events to really kind of create that

00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:52,970
bond between people that are working

00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:54,799
around the world virtually and it's a

00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:57,470
great marketing platform to promote the

00:02:54,799 --> 00:03:00,260
project the project as well so that's a

00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:01,909
really important focus of ours we have

00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:06,590
an additional program called community

00:03:01,909 --> 00:03:09,379
grants so if you have an idea and for

00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:12,170
promoting Drupal whether it's growing

00:03:09,379 --> 00:03:14,209
our developer base or gain out to

00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:16,790
different industry sectors to promote

00:03:14,209 --> 00:03:19,069
Drupal and grow adoption by different

00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:22,609
site owners we have a Grants program

00:03:19,069 --> 00:03:24,590
that you can apply to and we've been

00:03:22,609 --> 00:03:25,609
giving out grants around the world and

00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:28,970
doing some really great things that

00:03:25,609 --> 00:03:31,400
range from camps and Indonesia to a

00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:35,120
Spanish language magazine for South

00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:36,230
America so be sure to reach out to us we

00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:39,049
can tell you more about that program

00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:43,900
also we want to help grow the community

00:03:39,049 --> 00:03:45,980
and attract more developers who can then

00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:47,870
contribute to the project so we have

00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:49,099
global training days to foster that and

00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:53,180
we're working with training companies

00:03:49,099 --> 00:03:55,549
around the world who do a half-day or

00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:57,739
full-day of free or near free training

00:03:55,549 --> 00:04:01,609
currently get the hello Drupal type of

00:03:57,739 --> 00:04:03,709
curriculum and they mark it in to their

00:04:01,609 --> 00:04:07,010
local communities and bring people in

00:04:03,709 --> 00:04:09,079
and kind of his way an on-ramp into our

00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:11,590
community so we're really excited to

00:04:09,079 --> 00:04:16,549
start expanding that program as well so

00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:19,220
all of these programs are funded through

00:04:16,549 --> 00:04:21,739

powers from Whole Foods a large grocery

00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:53,240
retail company in North America is going

00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:55,220
to be talking about how he selected

00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:57,620
Drupal what that process looked like and

00:05:55,220 --> 00:06:00,050
how someone and selling Drupal and their

00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:03,110
services can help influence people like

00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:07,510
him to select Drupal and and you're in

00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:09,410
your solutions ok so that is some

00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:12,320
something's happening with a Drupal

00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:13,789
Association I did mention that the

00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:17,479
supporting partner program is one of the

00:06:13,789 --> 00:06:20,660
ways that we raise funds it is primarily

00:06:17,479 --> 00:06:22,010
for Drupal businesses to get special

00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:24,830
exposure in our communities so they get

00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:26,720
some great benefits but all of the funds

00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:29,720
are going to hire that drupal.org tech

00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:31,460
team and phase 2 was one of the first

00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:33,350
companies to sign up for this program

00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:35,240
and we're really excited to have their

00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:37,760
support and knowing that we can start

00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:39,380
hiring this team to work on drupal.org

00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:41,090
is just a

00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:42,110
wonderful thing we're really excited to

00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:46,070
get there and we couldn't do it without

00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:49,040
the support of phase two so with that

00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:52,820
I'd like to hand this presentation over

00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:54,620
to Mike Potter who is the solution

00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:59,120
architect at phase two and today he's

00:06:54,620 --> 00:07:01,360
going to talk about open atrium 2.0 so

00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,920
mike thanks for joining today

00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:07,010
hey thanks I'm happy to be here and

00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:08,930
welcome everybody so yeah today we're

00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:10,940
going to talk about open atrium 2 we're

00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:13,250
going to do things a little differently

00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:15,620
if you've seen any of the other past

00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:17,210
webinars that we've done I decided to do

00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:19,400
something special for the Drupal

00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:22,520
Association here so we're gonna make

00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:23,660
this a little bit more developer heavy a

00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:26,770
little bit more site builder having

00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:30,190
let's go ahead and go to the next slide

00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:32,540
and go to the go to the next slide so

00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:34,610
just an overview first of all I'm not

00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:36,860
going to really go into a lot about what

00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:39,140
open atrium 2 is I'll point you to a lot

00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:40,880
of information but we've we've really

00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:42,830
talked about it to death in a lot of

00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,750
different areas so we're gonna try to

00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:47,360
get past the the kind of the initial

00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:50,510
intro but basically open atrium - it's a

00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:52,760
collaboration framework we built it from

00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:54,440
the ground up in Drupal 7 and one of the

00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:57,200
specific things we focused on this time

00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:59,660
around compared to open atrium 1 was to

00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:01,970
make it much more much easier to extend

00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:03,260
the functionality so that's what we're

00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:06,140
going to talk about today we're going to

00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:09,890
actually use some existing Drupal

00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:12,500
modules - to extend open atrium so a

00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:14,600
plug-in in the atrium is just a module

00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:16,520
it can be really any kind of module you

00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:20,210
can build a module using features or

00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:21,410
apps or just write some custom code but

00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:23,720
however you want to do it you just

00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:25,070
create a module and if you do things a

00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,940
certain way that we'll show you here in

00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:27,890
a minute

00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:30,380
atrium will recognize that module and

00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:32,570
you'll have new functionality so I

00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:35,150
wanted to point to a place where we have

00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:38,630
our documentation the link is there in

00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:40,490
the slides if you go to our products

00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:41,450
face to technology comm site that's

00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:44,090
where we have all of our distribution

00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:47,120
documentation for open public and open

00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:48,530
publish and also open atrium and a

00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,270
section of that is called the community

00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:51,470
plugin toolkit and that's where we're

00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:52,280
putting a lot of this technical

00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:55,160
documentation

00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:56,930
and we're updating that to kind of as we

00:08:55,160 --> 00:09:00,890
speak so it should get better over time

00:08:56,930 --> 00:09:03,410
as well so with that what we're going to

00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:08,060
do today is we're going to create a very

00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:09,770
simple - dude's ask so atrium - right

00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:11,480
now does not shift with any kind of

00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:14,450
issue tracking system like ATM one had

00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:16,130
case tracker issue tracking is a very

00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:18,110
broad subject and different people

00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:19,670
really have different needs so rather

00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:22,370
than trying to build the world's best

00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:24,140
issue tracker we decide to either leave

00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:27,050
it to the community or integrate with

00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:28,190
existing enterprise solutions but you

00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:29,960
know maybe you just want something

00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:31,670
really really simple like what what if

00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:33,800
you just want like a to-do task and a

00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:36,230
task list so we're gonna show you really

00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:37,520
how easy that is to do today so even

00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:39,770
though we don't have it built into the

00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:41,750
product it's gonna be really easy to add

00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:43,880
it yourself and customize it for your

00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:45,170
own organization so this is basically

00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:46,610
the steps of the demo that we're going

00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:49,400
to go through we're going to create a

00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:51,800
task content type we're then going to

00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:54,050
create some views we're then going to

00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:56,000
create some panelizer layouts and we're

00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:58,040
gonna then test it and save it all to

00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,630
features so if you're used to Drupal

00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:01,790
site building these kind of steps should

00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:03,260
be really familiar development for open

00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:05,330
atrium is really not that different than

00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:07,490
general Drupal development and you can

00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:11,000
all do all this without without writing

00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:12,980
code so let's jump into the demo let's

00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:22,070
see if we can switch our screen over

00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:33,380
here so they need to give me presenter

00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:34,550
access here look at my little pop-up -

00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:41,810
Megan can you switch over there

00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:45,230
presenter there we go so my screen okay

00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:48,020
so you should be seeing my screen here

00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:50,120
I'm on the the duple association or the

00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:51,230
the drupal.org page for open atrium this

00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,610
is where I mentioned if you want to get

00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:56,450
more information I just go to the

00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:59,450
project page down here we've got a bunch

00:10:56,450 --> 00:11:00,500
of webinars and various videos linked we

00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:03,260
talked about all the different modules

00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:05,620
that we include and all that so that's

00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:07,510
definitely a kind of your first

00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:09,970
course that you'll want to go to a few

00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:11,830
want more information so now I'm going

00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:14,529
to pop over to an atrium site that's

00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:16,300
here my local computer this is what I'm

00:11:14,529 --> 00:11:17,740
used for past demos so if you've come to

00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:20,050
my past webinars of kind of recognized

00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:22,060
with the content it's a little basic

00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:24,130
university site with various departments

00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:25,420
and schools and and so forth

00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:28,600
so what we're going to do is we're going

00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:30,779
to add some tasks so the first thing we

00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:33,160
want to do is go create a content type

00:11:30,779 --> 00:11:35,020
so we're going to go into our duple

00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:39,400
admin menu over here and go the

00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:41,740
structure content type and this is a

00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:44,410
live demo so cross our fingers and hope

00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:47,110
the demo gods are with this day we're

00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:58,870
going to add a content type and we're

00:11:47,110 --> 00:12:02,860
going to call this a task we can save

00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:05,550
that and now let's see what kinds of

00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:09,670
things do we want for tasks typically

00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:13,150
tasks are going to have a due date and

00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:15,730
somebody they're assigned to and maybe a

00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:17,230
priority so we're gonna go down here to

00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:19,450
the tasks we just created and we're

00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:20,770
going to go to manage fields and we're

00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:22,270
just gonna do the standard stuff we

00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:24,910
wouldn't want you to add those so let's

00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:26,709
go ahead and a due date and make that a

00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:32,230
date type and we'll use a pop-up

00:12:26,709 --> 00:12:34,540
calendar save that field then we're

00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:37,900
gonna add an assigned to field for a

00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:39,459
user let's see and we're just gonna

00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:41,230
accept the defaults here we're not doing

00:12:39,459 --> 00:12:46,930
anything fancy so just accept all the

00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:50,740
defaults for the date field now we're

00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:53,110
going to have an assigned two and four

00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:55,660
user fields were in if you dip d6 you're

00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:56,920
used to the old user reference in d7

00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:59,140
everything's and Emma D so we're gonna

00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:00,790
make this an enemy reference and since

00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:02,620
we're only going to be looking at

00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:04,540
assignment two people within our kind of

00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:06,160
project team I'm gonna leave this as a

00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:08,560
select list because we shouldn't have a

00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,790
lot of users if you have hundreds of

00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,680
users you might want to make that an

00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:14,079
autocomplete but we're just gonna keep

00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:15,700
this as a simple select list now you

00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:18,730
don't want it to show every single user

00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:19,510
on your site so this is our first chance

00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:21,639
to show you

00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:24,850
some of the additions atrium is made to

00:13:21,639 --> 00:13:26,079
Drupal to kind of help you along first

00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:28,089
of all we're going to say that this

00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:31,959
points instead of pointing to a node

00:13:28,089 --> 00:13:33,610
that it points to a user and to select

00:13:31,959 --> 00:13:35,019
users you can do several things you can

00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:36,370
have just a simple selector and that's

00:13:35,019 --> 00:13:37,959
going to show you every single user on

00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:40,420
the system and you really only want to

00:13:37,959 --> 00:13:43,420
assign your tasks to people within your

00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:46,779
atrium team or space so what we're gonna

00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:48,730
do is say let's give a views filter for

00:13:46,779 --> 00:13:51,250
this field and only show the results of

00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:53,110
a view and we come with a predefined

00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:55,300
view here called the open atrium user

00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:56,769
filter so when you select that as your

00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:58,630
enemy filter it's gonna automatically

00:13:56,769 --> 00:14:00,220
filter it so that you only see users

00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:02,709
within your space

00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:04,570
users who are members of your space and

00:14:02,709 --> 00:14:07,930
we're also going to tell it also always

00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:12,310
render your filters as a select list and

00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:14,199
save that okay so that gives us basic

00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:18,899
let's see what's going to add a priority

00:14:14,199 --> 00:14:24,370
field well here we're gonna make this a

00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:27,760
your list and we're just gonna set up a

00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:29,649
couple simple priorities you know if

00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:31,120
you're doing this for you know real you

00:14:29,649 --> 00:14:32,170
might want to make this a taxonomy or

00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,930
something but we're just going to do a

00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:40,740
simple select list here so we're just

00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:40,740
gonna do let's say that zero priority

00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:51,790
all right just basic stuff alright so

00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:53,170
those are the typical fields you would

00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:55,269
add to a task you know maybe you want

00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:57,550
some more but that's that's something

00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:59,050
that you do if you were doing a tree or

00:14:57,550 --> 00:15:01,690
not that's just basic field so now how

00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:03,550
do we make this tie in to atrium there's

00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:05,829
two key things we want to do to tie this

00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:07,839
content type in atrium we need to make

00:15:05,829 --> 00:15:09,790
it aware of our space that we're in in

00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:11,079
this case the physics department and we

00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:12,790
need to make it aware of what section

00:15:11,079 --> 00:15:14,230
we're in within the space will see

00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:16,120
sections here in a minute so we have two

00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:18,100
fields to add there's a couple different

00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:20,529
ways to add those fields you could go

00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:22,750
down to add existing field and when you

00:15:20,529 --> 00:15:24,339
select the existing fields you just see

00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:25,870
a whole bunch of fields and you know

00:15:24,339 --> 00:15:27,490
it's kind of confusing as to which one

00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:28,959
you want to add you know in this case

00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:31,959
for example we want to add this group

00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:33,459
audience field and this section field so

00:15:31,959 --> 00:15:35,319
they're both right here

00:15:33,459 --> 00:15:37,240
but this list is kind of intimidating

00:15:35,319 --> 00:15:39,519
and you might be afraid of selecting the

00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:41,589
wrong field so there's a little bit of

00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:44,199
an easier way to do that from organic

00:15:41,589 --> 00:15:46,389
groups if you go to your admin menu and

00:15:44,199 --> 00:15:49,600
we go down to configure and then go down

00:15:46,389 --> 00:15:52,860
to organic groups there's this settings

00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:56,350
Oh T field settings this lets you add

00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:58,029
various types of fields for organic

00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:59,769
groups to your content types

00:15:58,029 --> 00:16:01,540
so up here in bundles we're gonna select

00:15:59,769 --> 00:16:03,939
the content type reduce created and we

00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:05,980
just created a task and we want to add

00:16:03,939 --> 00:16:07,660
this group audience field and you can

00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:09,730
see it's gonna be called OG grid breath

00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:10,660
don't change the field name just leave

00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:13,540
it as the default

00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:15,939
and let's just say add field and you'll

00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:18,790
see down here all the content types that

00:16:15,939 --> 00:16:20,619
we've already added fields to so now we

00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:22,540
want to select our task again and now

00:16:20,619 --> 00:16:24,759
we're going to add this new field open

00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:27,819
atrium section so open atrium ties into

00:16:24,759 --> 00:16:30,279
this organic groups UI and adds this

00:16:27,819 --> 00:16:32,980
field that you can add to your content

00:16:30,279 --> 00:16:34,449
type as well so we just say add field so

00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:36,189
doing it that way just ensures that you

00:16:34,449 --> 00:16:38,230
get the right fields added if you look

00:16:36,189 --> 00:16:40,540
at an example for example in an event

00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:43,929
you'll see an event node has those same

00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:45,759
fields as well alright so now that's

00:16:43,929 --> 00:16:49,149
basically all we need to do to make that

00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:51,369
content type accessible atrium so hvm is

00:16:49,149 --> 00:16:52,839
aware of it so the next thing we're

00:16:51,369 --> 00:16:56,559
gonna do from a psych building

00:16:52,839 --> 00:17:02,649
perspective is we're going to make a

00:16:56,559 --> 00:17:05,939
view so let's go to structure views now

00:17:02,649 --> 00:17:08,649
atrium uses panels it's built on panoply

00:17:05,939 --> 00:17:10,929
so when you're creating views you're

00:17:08,649 --> 00:17:14,709
going to always be creating content

00:17:10,929 --> 00:17:17,470
panes content panes are special types of

00:17:14,709 --> 00:17:19,600
views that our panels aware so in this

00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:24,130
case let's call our view name the task

00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:27,669
view and we're gonna show content of

00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:29,470
type tasks in the newest first is fine

00:17:27,669 --> 00:17:31,720
but we're not going to create a page

00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:33,520
we're just gonna say unclick that we're

00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:35,440
just going to continue an edit because

00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:38,409
we don't want a page we want a content

00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:39,840
pane and if you're not familiar with

00:17:38,409 --> 00:17:42,789
panels this might be a little new to you

00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:44,350
but basically you go to add display and

00:17:42,789 --> 00:17:46,090
just like you would add a block or any

00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:47,220
other kind of view there's a view type

00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:52,540
called content

00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:54,580
so we'll select that and now let's see

00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:58,059
let's let's pretty this up a little bit

00:17:54,580 --> 00:18:03,940
first here let's give this a title let's

00:17:58,059 --> 00:18:05,530
call it and now with fur we're just

00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:06,790
gonna keep this as an unformatted list

00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:08,410
and you'll see why in a minute what we

00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:10,570
want to do here is build a very generic

00:18:08,410 --> 00:18:12,010
view and then we're gonna be able to use

00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:13,090
this view in lots of different ways so

00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:14,530
we're going to keep it generic we're

00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:16,990
just gonna make it an unformatted list

00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:18,760
both fields so it's already added the

00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:21,190
title field for us let's go ahead and

00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:25,750
add those other fields that we added

00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:29,340
content type so we had due date we're

00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:36,549
going to add that we've defined the two

00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:39,040
that we had prior so we're gonna add all

00:18:36,549 --> 00:18:40,840
three of these at the same time and

00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:42,760
we're just gonna select the defaults so

00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:44,500
we're just gonna check the labels here

00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:48,580
make sure that looks okay so assigned to

00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:49,960
that looks fine and due date that looks

00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:54,630
fine but I don't really care about the

00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:58,540
time let's just show the day itself here

00:18:54,630 --> 00:19:04,090
and then for priority let's we'll just

00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:05,799
take the defaults as well all right so

00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:07,570
we added our basic fields so any other

00:19:05,799 --> 00:19:11,049
fields that you wanted to put into your

00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:12,820
view you couldn't put here so then again

00:19:11,049 --> 00:19:14,950
how do we tie this into atrium we only

00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:17,799
want this for you to show us the tasks

00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:19,720
for the project space that we're in and

00:19:17,799 --> 00:19:21,100
for the section that we're in so we need

00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:22,360
to add some filters now there's a couple

00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:24,929
different ways that people have done

00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:28,570
this in the past you can get into adding

00:19:24,929 --> 00:19:30,160
contextual filters and relationships if

00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:32,679
you've done organic groups before you

00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:34,960
may be familiar with doing relationships

00:19:32,679 --> 00:19:37,600
with like the og membership table it all

00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:40,210
gets very confusing honestly the og

00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:42,100
membership stuff is complicated so again

00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:44,620
we tried to simplify your life here by

00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:46,710
just adding some custom filters so let's

00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:49,510
just go ahead and add some filters and

00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:52,929
what we want to first filter on is what

00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:54,520
space you're in and fortunately our cube

00:19:52,929 --> 00:19:57,250
doesn't narrow it down too much but if

00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:59,260
we scroll down we'll find content space

00:19:57,250 --> 00:20:00,970
or content space ID either one of those

00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:02,710
they're both aliases

00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:05,140
and their aliases of that field we added

00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:08,380
the group audience field so let's just

00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:10,420
add that so we're going to make this a

00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:12,160
filter but we want this to be a filter

00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:14,530
that we can change later so we're going

00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:16,120
to expose this filter exposing the

00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:18,400
filter is going to allow it to respond

00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:20,890
to the space we're in and instead of

00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:26,410
calling a group audience we're going to

00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:30,580
call it just space okay we'll leave it

00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:32,590
all the rest is the defaults and so now

00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:34,450
we have a filter for our space our

00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:40,540
Google News field now let's do the same

00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:42,160
thing for our section section you'll

00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:45,370
here's here's that section ref field

00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:47,530
that we added so we're gonna make this

00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:49,120
also an exposed filter because again we

00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:52,000
want it to respond to what section we're

00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:56,100
in as we browse the site so we'll expose

00:20:52,000 --> 00:21:01,420
it and just call this simply section

00:20:56,100 --> 00:21:04,060
okay so we've added some filters so now

00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:05,740
let's do a couple other final cleanup

00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:07,420
things here first of all since we're

00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:09,850
making this for panels typically you

00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:12,760
want your content pane to respond to

00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:14,290
your panels path in our case we're not

00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:15,640
really doing anything with this but it's

00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:18,310
just kind of best practice when you're

00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:21,220
doing content panes to set that use

00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:23,080
panel path yes we're also going to want

00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:24,730
this to respond to Ajax we don't want it

00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:27,100
to load the whole page when we're just

00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:29,560
changing a view on the page so we're

00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:33,160
gonna turn on Ajax to make it a bit more

00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:34,870
useable okay now the last thing that

00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:36,400
we're gonna do is a little bit different

00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:38,080
here we created those exposed filters

00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:40,690
but how do we make those exposed filters

00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:43,000
available now to the the panel's

00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:45,880
interface in atrium we've added some

00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:48,550
functionality to panels and panelizer

00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:50,470
if you go to allow settings allow

00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:53,140
settings is typically how you expose

00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:56,350
what you want people to change from the

00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:58,090
panels from the panelizer interface so

00:21:56,350 --> 00:22:00,190
for example you might design your view

00:21:58,090 --> 00:22:01,780
to only show 20 items but you want to

00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:03,820
change it you know what you want to let

00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:05,200
the site designers change that when they

00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:07,090
put it on the page to show a different

00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:09,700
number of items in our case we're going

00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:13,210
to let the the page designer override

00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:14,830
the title we're going to give this

00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:16,659
exposed form and the

00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:18,789
them to override the fields and then

00:22:16,659 --> 00:22:21,100
this is a new one this says used exposed

00:22:18,789 --> 00:22:23,049
widgets as pain configuration this says

00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:25,870
take all of our exposed filters and make

00:22:23,049 --> 00:22:28,570
them available to the pain configuration

00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:31,059
and you can control down here for each

00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:33,460
filter whether it's available for just

00:22:31,059 --> 00:22:35,470
the pain configuration for panels

00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:37,419
whether it's for both the pain

00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:39,460
configuration and exposing to the end

00:22:37,419 --> 00:22:42,250
user or whether it's only a normal

00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:43,510
exposed filter to the end user so this

00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:45,429
is what you're used to for normal

00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:47,260
exposed filters for these we're gonna

00:22:45,429 --> 00:22:49,840
actually select this middle option of

00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:52,899
allowing both and you'll see why in a

00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:59,559
second so let's apply that so now we've

00:22:52,899 --> 00:23:00,850
got our view we're gonna save it let's

00:22:59,559 --> 00:23:06,880
see actually I want to make one more

00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:10,600
change after we save it here just wait

00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:12,190
for our network to save this the last

00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:14,710
change I want to make is over here to

00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:17,470
the exposed form we've actually added

00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:19,000
another extension with atrium so instead

00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:20,860
of your normal you know the normal

00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,380
exposed filters is going to put these

00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:24,700
filters at the top of the page from a

00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:26,919
usability point of view we look kind of

00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:28,600
like to collapse that by default so

00:23:26,919 --> 00:23:31,960
there's a new type of exposed form

00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:34,779
called the open atrium exposed form and

00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:36,700
it adds an option to your exposed form

00:23:34,779 --> 00:23:39,190
down here at the bottom called collapsed

00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:41,080
filter and that says by default we're

00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:42,460
going to collapse that filter section so

00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:44,799
it doesn't kind of clutter up the page

00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:46,600
and you'll see that in operation here in

00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:49,210
a minute so again just another one of

00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:52,360
the little helpers that atrium adds to

00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:56,649
two views in this case so now let's save

00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:58,450
that now we're done with the views so

00:23:56,649 --> 00:24:01,779
now we've got a content type we've got a

00:23:58,450 --> 00:24:04,870
view of that content type our next thing

00:24:01,779 --> 00:24:06,580
is to put that view on a page so we're

00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:08,590
going to create a new type of section so

00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:10,809
atrium ships with different section

00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:13,179
types for things like an event calendar

00:24:10,809 --> 00:24:16,450
and a discussion post let's create a new

00:24:13,179 --> 00:24:17,950
section type for tasks so we're gonna go

00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:19,539
to the admin menu and down here under

00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:22,539
the open atrium configuration we've

00:24:19,539 --> 00:24:23,679
created a nice little hot link to

00:24:22,539 --> 00:24:25,870
panelizer

00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:28,340
for section templates you can find this

00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:30,770
really buried within the panelizer

00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:32,179
laughing but we brought it up here just

00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:34,730
to make it easier to jump straight to

00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:37,370
this page so this is showing us a list

00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:39,590
of all the different panelizer layouts

00:24:37,370 --> 00:24:41,120
available for the section page content

00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:43,640
type and you'll see the different

00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:45,049
sections atrium ships with now instead

00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:46,700
of starting from scratch let's just

00:24:45,049 --> 00:24:48,730
clone one of these existing ones so

00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:51,950
we're going to clone the new section

00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:57,950
click clone and we're gonna make this

00:24:51,950 --> 00:25:00,169
into our tasks section and while we're

00:24:57,950 --> 00:25:01,870
here let's change this machine name here

00:25:00,169 --> 00:25:08,360
if there's something better than clone

00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:11,330
so let's make this wait a second okay so

00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:13,539
by cloning this now we want to edit it

00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:15,710
and just make a couple of changes good

00:25:13,539 --> 00:25:17,330
so we're gonna go down here and you can

00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:19,370
change all sorts of things in these

00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:21,770
panelizer x' what we want to change is

00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:25,610
how the content is presented which is

00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:27,200
basically changing the page content so

00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:29,480
you'll see that by default here we've

00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:31,700
got a page content that shows the body

00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:33,320
of the section some links you know has

00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:35,029
the visibility over here but

00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:37,279
specifically because we cloned the news

00:25:35,029 --> 00:25:39,440
layout we've got this recent news widget

00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:44,299
so let's get rid of the recent news

00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:46,190
widget and we're gonna add that view

00:25:44,299 --> 00:25:48,529
that we just created so we'll get rid of

00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:51,860
that we'll go up here to content we'll

00:25:48,529 --> 00:25:55,010
say add content and we created a Content

00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:57,500
pane right so under view panes are all

00:25:55,010 --> 00:25:59,029
the content panes on the system there's

00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:00,860
a couple from organic groups but here's

00:25:59,029 --> 00:26:02,480
that task view that we created over here

00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:06,130
on the right bottom so we're just going

00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:08,200
to add that task view now

00:26:06,130 --> 00:26:09,790
that task view to expose various things

00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:19,750
to let us change so we can change the

00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:21,850
title so let's just call this gym you'll

00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:23,890
notice by default those basin section

00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:25,660
filters are filled in with active space

00:26:23,890 --> 00:26:27,070
and active section when you click on

00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:29,560
this you can change it you can make it

00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:31,180
show any space or you can make it show

00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:34,030
any section within the space where you

00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:36,610
could show specific sections or specific

00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:38,800
spaces but by leaving it is active that

00:26:36,610 --> 00:26:41,950
will make this page dynamic and it will

00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:45,160
respond to whatever space the the user

00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:47,170
is in now we also are going to let the

00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:50,380
user change that so we're going to

00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:53,020
actually expose our form and we're going

00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:55,000
to actually keep the defaults here but

00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:56,320
we're going to make this into a table so

00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,660
this is why I meant about keeping this

00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:01,240
is a very general purpose of view

00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:04,420
because I made the view unformatted now

00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:06,550
at kind of panels configuration time I

00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:08,560
can select whether or not I just want to

00:27:06,550 --> 00:27:10,380
show unformatted fields or whether I

00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:13,330
want to show you know a particular

00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:15,460
teaser or you know different display

00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:17,620
mode so if you add new display modes you

00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:19,720
can see those here or in my case I'm

00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:21,040
gonna make this a table and put the

00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:22,810
titles along the column header and I'm

00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:24,280
gonna keep all these fields here and

00:27:22,810 --> 00:27:26,710
we'll see how this gets displayed when

00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:29,140
we add some content to the site but that

00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:34,210
is the task view that we want to show on

00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:37,030
a tasks section page let's save that so

00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:39,640
now we've got a panelizer layout the

00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:42,070
last step here is to make that layout

00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:45,490
available to our section type taxonomy

00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:49,090
so the way section pages are done is we

00:27:45,490 --> 00:27:51,070
have a taxonomy for sections called

00:27:49,090 --> 00:27:53,110
section type we also have a space type

00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:56,050
one that works the same way so we're

00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:58,440
going to add a new type of section and

00:27:56,050 --> 00:28:02,590
we're gonna call this our task section

00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:06,910
again and here is where we specify for

00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:08,770
this type of section we want to use the

00:28:06,910 --> 00:28:12,250
layout we just created the panelizer

00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:15,070
layout and we want this section to be

00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:17,260
able to create tasks and this is what

00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:19,390
controls what appears up here in this

00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:20,020
plus button when you click a plus button

00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:22,030
other

00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:24,490
action page it's gonna show you whatever

00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:25,990
types of content you've added here and

00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:28,000
these are called command buttons and you

00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:29,320
can look up command buttons and see how

00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,900
those are done but basically we just

00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:34,090
have this new type of section all right

00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:35,710
so we're all done we've got the content

00:28:34,090 --> 00:28:37,570
type we've got the view we've got the

00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:39,820
panelizer layout we've got the section

00:28:37,570 --> 00:28:42,040
type let's go create some content so

00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:43,510
we're in our space the first thing we

00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:45,880
want to do in our space is create our

00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:49,290
task area so we create a new section

00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:59,350
page we're gonna call this section

00:28:49,290 --> 00:29:01,420
public tasks this open so this is gonna

00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:03,370
be a task list that anybody can see and

00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:05,500
down here on your section type we're

00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:11,650
gonna select that new task section that

00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:14,320
we just created and publish this so now

00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:16,450
we're in our public task section so

00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:17,950
let's create a task so now you go up

00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:21,550
here in your list the create task is

00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:27,870
listed because the section type enables

00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:33,130
create tasks so this is going to be a

00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:34,360
public and it's in our tasks section

00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:37,440
that we could have rearranged some of

00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:43,300
these fields let's see let's just make

00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:46,300
this contain some text here some

00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:49,300
standard stuff like that so that's the

00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:50,530
name of our task and now of course we

00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:51,940
have to give it a due date and then

00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:54,700
assign to so we're gonna give it a due

00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:56,380
date maybe this Friday when we click

00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:58,210
assign - you'll see that we only see the

00:29:56,380 --> 00:30:00,280
users within our physics space in this

00:29:58,210 --> 00:30:01,870
case there's only two users so let's a

00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:03,970
ton as its assign this task to the

00:30:01,870 --> 00:30:06,010
professor and we'll give it high

00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:07,690
priority but you'll see it's

00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:10,660
automatically assigned it to the correct

00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:12,400
group and the correct section so when

00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:14,440
I'm doing a real site design I often

00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:15,580
hide these fields because the users

00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:17,770
should really need to change them

00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:21,670
they're automatically set up for you by

00:30:17,770 --> 00:30:23,230
atrium so when we publish this task we

00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:25,690
haven't done anything to make the

00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:27,460
display fancy so it's just showing us

00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:29,380
the fields here so you'd obviously

00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:31,570
probably do some xenian in this page to

00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:33,310
make your task look look better but now

00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:33,799
if we go back to our section page for

00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:35,929
public

00:30:33,799 --> 00:30:38,239
asks you'll see our table that we

00:30:35,929 --> 00:30:41,929
created so remember we added that view

00:30:38,239 --> 00:30:43,850
to our section layout and we told the

00:30:41,929 --> 00:30:46,340
view to be table and we gave it these

00:30:43,850 --> 00:30:48,710
columns we told it to make the filter

00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:51,019
exposed and collapsed by default so this

00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:52,399
is that open atrium filter setting you

00:30:51,019 --> 00:30:54,980
see this little filter button that lets

00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:56,749
you expand and collapse so right now

00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:59,690
it's automatically filtering this by the

00:30:56,749 --> 00:31:02,289
section that I'm in and this is open to

00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:07,970
the public so if I switch over to a

00:31:02,289 --> 00:31:09,470
anonymous browser window here and we go

00:31:07,970 --> 00:31:11,480
to the physics department so here I just

00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:14,419
opened in incognito window wicked

00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:15,320
Chrome's where we're logged out here but

00:31:14,419 --> 00:31:21,489
you'll see I can go into the public

00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:21,489
tasks and I can get an error message

00:31:21,789 --> 00:31:25,399
obviously something broken last night's

00:31:23,989 --> 00:31:27,369
build okay well normally you would go to

00:31:25,399 --> 00:31:31,879
public tasks you can see the task list

00:31:27,369 --> 00:31:35,179
so now let's go ahead and make a new

00:31:31,879 --> 00:31:37,519
section so those are public tasks let's

00:31:35,179 --> 00:31:39,710
go ahead and make a private task area so

00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:43,340
we'll go back to our space we'll add

00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:43,820
another section and we're gonna call

00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:51,350
this one

00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:54,109
private tasks private again we're just

00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:57,039
gonna make it use our tasks section that

00:31:54,109 --> 00:31:59,389
we created so we'll publish this section

00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:01,970
we need to make this section private

00:31:59,389 --> 00:32:04,460
right so right now it's public let's go

00:32:01,970 --> 00:32:06,409
edit this section now let's make this

00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:08,840
private so it's only visible to our

00:32:06,409 --> 00:32:11,179
little project team so we have we have

00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:12,710
this team created within our space only

00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:16,929
has a couple members in it we're gonna

00:32:12,710 --> 00:32:22,669
make this task specific to this project

00:32:16,929 --> 00:32:24,289
let's save that so now when it displays

00:32:22,669 --> 00:32:26,779
the section it's going to tell us that

00:32:24,289 --> 00:32:28,460
this is now private and the only people

00:32:26,779 --> 00:32:30,830
who can see this page are the member of

00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:34,159
this team when I click on this team I'll

00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:36,889
see that it's only got the professor in

00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:38,649
student minute so they're the only ones

00:32:36,889 --> 00:32:41,029
that can see this particular project

00:32:38,649 --> 00:32:43,570
let's create a task now within this

00:32:41,029 --> 00:32:43,570
project

00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:58,220
so this is a secret task the project you

00:32:54,570 --> 00:33:01,650
can see and let's give it a due date

00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:03,330
Monday we're gonna assign this one to

00:33:01,650 --> 00:33:08,780
the student we're gonna give this one

00:33:03,330 --> 00:33:08,780
like a critical priority publish that

00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:18,480
and now when we go to our private task

00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:21,030
landing page we'll see that table is

00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:23,610
only showing us tasks within this

00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:26,370
private task area let's go ahead and

00:33:23,610 --> 00:33:34,020
create one more just we have a little

00:33:26,370 --> 00:33:44,940
bit more content to work with here this

00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:46,800
one Thursday professor so now we've got

00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:50,700
a couple tasks will get basic to do

00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:52,380
tasks kind of stuff and obviously you'd

00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:55,170
while I add you know go ahead add boxes

00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:56,880
for completing tasks and all that kind

00:33:55,170 --> 00:33:58,320
of stuff so right now when we create

00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:00,720
this view we've just created the view to

00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:02,070
sort by a due date you'd probably want

00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:05,370
to change it in the future to sort by

00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:06,810
priority or maybe even expose some sort

00:34:05,370 --> 00:34:08,940
options that would show up here so you

00:34:06,810 --> 00:34:11,490
could change how this was sorted within

00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:13,200
this filter but you'll notice that as I

00:34:11,490 --> 00:34:16,050
go between the private tasks if I go

00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:17,790
back to the public tasks section it's

00:34:16,050 --> 00:34:20,040
only showing me tasks that are public

00:34:17,790 --> 00:34:23,100
now what if I wanted to put a list of

00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:24,450
all tasks up on the space page so in

00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:26,790
this case let's go back to the physics

00:34:24,450 --> 00:34:29,040
department the global space page you can

00:34:26,790 --> 00:34:30,960
see in the recent activity River that

00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:33,810
it's noted it's kind of logged all these

00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:35,250
tasks I just created here but let's

00:34:33,810 --> 00:34:36,900
create a widget or week here on the

00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:39,150
right-hand side that always shows us all

00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:43,380
of our tasks so we're going to customize

00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:45,200
this space page and we're going to add a

00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:47,700
new widget so we're gonna click the plus

00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:49,560
we're gonna select that good old view

00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:52,290
that we created because that view we

00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:57,360
made is multi-purpose we're gonna add

00:34:52,290 --> 00:35:00,660
the view we're gonna call this project

00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:01,590
call this all tasks because what we're

00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:03,090
gonna do is we're gonna keep it on

00:35:01,590 --> 00:35:06,540
active space but we're gonna tell it to

00:35:03,090 --> 00:35:08,370
show any section within the space we're

00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:09,450
not going to show the exposed form and

00:35:08,370 --> 00:35:10,020
in this case I don't want to make it

00:35:09,450 --> 00:35:12,870
table

00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:17,130
I just want to display the title so I'm

00:35:12,870 --> 00:35:22,350
gonna uncheck all these other fields and

00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:24,630
we're gonna save that so here you see

00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:29,990
the preview all tasks here's the three

00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:32,610
tasks we'll save this as a custom node

00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:34,260
so we've just customized our space we've

00:35:32,610 --> 00:35:36,450
added a task list and you can see that

00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:38,100
it's showing us all three of the tasks

00:35:36,450 --> 00:35:41,040
the private ones and the public one

00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:43,860
because I'm logged in as admin if I go

00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:46,740
back over here to our logged out user

00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:50,390
and refresh the the physics department

00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:50,390
page hopefully this time this will work

00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:57,420
and now it's showing us the tasks widget

00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:59,370
that we just added and you'll notice

00:35:57,420 --> 00:36:02,130
that public users can only see the

00:35:59,370 --> 00:36:04,710
public task they do not see the secret

00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:06,870
tasks that were private for the project

00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:09,000
so that's the access control kicking in

00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:11,310
in the recent activity River they only

00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:13,290
see the public stuff they don't see

00:36:11,310 --> 00:36:16,620
anything about any of those secret -

00:36:13,290 --> 00:36:18,450
secret tasks in fact if I tried to trick

00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:21,330
it if I go to the secret task over here

00:36:18,450 --> 00:36:23,910
as my admin user if I click on that task

00:36:21,330 --> 00:36:27,830
to go to its page I can copy this URL

00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:31,920
and go back over to my logged out user

00:36:27,830 --> 00:36:34,050
page get in the URL and you'll see that

00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:36,560
we get access denied so we've dropped

00:36:34,050 --> 00:36:38,790
we've got truly private content now

00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:42,390
created within the physics department

00:36:38,790 --> 00:36:45,420
space so all we did was create a normal

00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:48,510
content type make a view out of it add

00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:50,550
the view to our panel Iser layout and

00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:53,070
start using it just added those fields

00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:54,960
for space and for section and that made

00:36:53,070 --> 00:36:57,180
the content type aware of atrium and

00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:59,760
turned on all of our access control

00:36:57,180 --> 00:37:01,350
rules that we have in atrium to let you

00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:04,140
have both private private and public

00:37:01,350 --> 00:37:05,400
content so a really simple example I

00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:09,640
mean you know this is obviously not a

00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:12,339
full-featured to do task list there

00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:14,049
but it gives you the basic idea of of

00:37:12,339 --> 00:37:16,599
what you can do with just your normal

00:37:14,049 --> 00:37:18,940
everyday Drupal modules that you're used

00:37:16,599 --> 00:37:20,319
to like views and panels now you know

00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:21,369
once we've tested this the last thing

00:37:20,319 --> 00:37:23,769
you're going to want to do is maybe you

00:37:21,369 --> 00:37:26,319
want to now use this as a plug-in on a

00:37:23,769 --> 00:37:28,240
different site so your last step would

00:37:26,319 --> 00:37:30,430
be to make this into a module to an

00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:31,990
actual plug-in module so what you do for

00:37:30,430 --> 00:37:36,940
that as you go to the features module

00:37:31,990 --> 00:37:43,089
under your site structure and we'll tell

00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:49,119
it to create a new feature once it

00:37:43,089 --> 00:37:50,740
decides to load alright so here we are

00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:55,720
under the features page will say create

00:37:50,740 --> 00:38:01,480
feature and we want to call this our

00:37:55,720 --> 00:38:11,170
open atrium task feature this catches up

00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:18,970
with this slow Network like demos or

00:38:11,170 --> 00:38:20,500
such funny I know I could complain that

00:38:18,970 --> 00:38:21,849
the future module is really slow but

00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:25,240
since I'm the maintainer of the features

00:38:21,849 --> 00:38:27,130
module that would be kind of insulting

00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:29,200
to myself okay here we go we're in

00:38:27,130 --> 00:38:33,579
features so we're gonna make this the

00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:35,500
opening to end task feature and what

00:38:33,579 --> 00:38:36,970
we're going to do is add the stuff that

00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:38,349
we just added now everything we added

00:38:36,970 --> 00:38:40,059
pretty much had the word tasks in it

00:38:38,349 --> 00:38:43,269
right so we're just gonna use this nice

00:38:40,059 --> 00:38:44,950
feature features of searching for tasks

00:38:43,269 --> 00:38:46,359
now there's the command button for

00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:48,039
creating tasks kanbans are actually

00:38:46,359 --> 00:38:50,170
handled automatically by content types

00:38:48,039 --> 00:38:51,789
so we don't actually need to export that

00:38:50,170 --> 00:38:55,720
but we do want to export that content

00:38:51,789 --> 00:38:57,309
type we created so let's click that and

00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:58,690
it's gonna auto add a bunch of other

00:38:57,309 --> 00:38:59,799
stuff down here it's gonna figure out

00:38:58,690 --> 00:39:02,140
the dependencies

00:38:59,799 --> 00:39:05,970
it's gonna automatically add those

00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:08,049
fields we have assigned date priority

00:39:05,970 --> 00:39:09,819
features now splits out the base

00:39:08,049 --> 00:39:12,490
definitions from the instances so it

00:39:09,819 --> 00:39:14,559
also knows that we have a body field and

00:39:12,490 --> 00:39:16,240
the section and group ref but these are

00:39:14,559 --> 00:39:17,710
shared fields so we're not getting the

00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:22,299
base of those fields we're just getting

00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:23,410
the instances we can do permissions we

00:39:22,299 --> 00:39:26,319
do want that panel I

00:39:23,410 --> 00:39:29,530
your section that we added so that's our

00:39:26,319 --> 00:39:31,660
section type and down the bottom we're

00:39:29,530 --> 00:39:33,369
gonna want to view here's that task view

00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:34,480
so that's everything that we created

00:39:33,369 --> 00:39:36,520
that we would want to put in the feature

00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:37,990
now the only thing that's that's tricky

00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:40,780
here that you can't put in features

00:39:37,990 --> 00:39:42,940
directly is the taxonomy term you'll

00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:46,450
remember we added the section type for

00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:48,039
tasks to the taxonomy taxonomy terms are

00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:49,900
not future Aiza becuz they're not

00:39:48,039 --> 00:39:51,970
they're considered content and not

00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:55,359
unique there is a way around that

00:39:51,970 --> 00:39:57,970
there's a module called UUID features

00:39:55,359 --> 00:40:00,400
and if you install the UUID features

00:39:57,970 --> 00:40:02,650
module that allows you to also export

00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:05,859
content like nodes and in particular

00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:07,539
lets you export taxonomy terms so you

00:40:05,859 --> 00:40:08,980
could do that you just want to be

00:40:07,539 --> 00:40:12,190
careful when you're installing that on a

00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:14,859
new site that there's no conflict with

00:40:12,190 --> 00:40:16,660
term IDs on the new site and that's

00:40:14,859 --> 00:40:18,130
typically why content is not exported

00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:20,200
because things like node IDs and

00:40:18,130 --> 00:40:22,690
taxonomy IDs could be different on

00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:24,940
different sites so when you copy this

00:40:22,690 --> 00:40:27,160
module or this plugin to your new site

00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:29,440
you might have to create that that

00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:31,150
taxonomy term manually you know what we

00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:33,670
normally do as developers in this case

00:40:31,150 --> 00:40:35,170
is we write a little code hook so we

00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:37,089
write an update hook that would create

00:40:35,170 --> 00:40:39,490
that taxonomy term when the module is

00:40:37,089 --> 00:40:41,260
installed but that would be writing code

00:40:39,490 --> 00:40:43,059
and I said we wouldn't write any code in

00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:46,390
this so if you don't want to write any

00:40:43,059 --> 00:40:47,500
code use the UUID features module but

00:40:46,390 --> 00:40:49,119
normally you would write code for that

00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:50,920
term but that would be it we would just

00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:53,740
we would then download this feature I

00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:56,650
mean it is going to download a new

00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:59,710
module for us called the do a task

00:40:56,650 --> 00:41:01,359
module can you treat test module so

00:40:59,710 --> 00:41:02,859
that's how you create a plug-in once you

00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:04,750
have that plug-in you can use it on any

00:41:02,859 --> 00:41:08,160
of the other 18 tree sites and I'm not

00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:12,069
going to actually do the download here

00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:15,059
let's cancel this each window that just

00:41:12,069 --> 00:41:15,059
opened up on my screen

00:41:19,550 --> 00:41:25,470
Wow what did the Maxis do here I just

00:41:22,830 --> 00:41:31,290
got this huge download window that spans

00:41:25,470 --> 00:41:32,730
multiple screens they're just or let's

00:41:31,290 --> 00:41:34,140
just go back to the let's actually go

00:41:32,730 --> 00:41:36,119
back to the slides now since that's the

00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:38,490
end of the demo so if we switch back

00:41:36,119 --> 00:41:41,010
over to the slides let's see do I have

00:41:38,490 --> 00:41:51,900
to note someone else changes presenter

00:41:41,010 --> 00:41:53,369
okay great back to the slides so

00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:56,700
somebody should be getting the pop up to

00:41:53,369 --> 00:42:08,400
accept screen presenting them yeah you

00:41:56,700 --> 00:42:11,220
can we didn't lose Stephanie sometimes

00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:15,140
the pop-up is hidden yeah there we go

00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:15,140
sometimes it hides behind other windows

00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:21,510
so to conclude what we've learned is

00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:23,640
developing for open atrium too is just

00:42:21,510 --> 00:42:25,440
like developing for drupal it's all

00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:27,840
drupal after all that's why weird that's

00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:29,040
why we all do this so any module that's

00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:31,320
out there that you want to use you can

00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:33,359
you can use with an atrium and use it to

00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:36,240
customize your atrium you can build your

00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:40,560
own plugins using content types and use

00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:42,390
panelizer in the taxonomy x' as i showed

00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:43,980
you we do provide some helpers to make

00:42:42,390 --> 00:42:46,530
the integration easier so we do have

00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:49,020
some custom filters and some exposed

00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:50,310
filters and some other little tweaks

00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:52,380
that's where you really put a lot of the

00:42:50,310 --> 00:42:54,119
work into atrium is trying to do those

00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:56,100
little fine-tune tweaks to make life a

00:42:54,119 --> 00:42:59,600
little bit easier so you're not dealing

00:42:56,100 --> 00:43:03,000
with some of the some of the raw drupal

00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:05,609
drupal methods there so then last slide

00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:08,100
if you want to learn more as I mentioned

00:43:05,609 --> 00:43:09,900
the project page on group org is a great

00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:12,180
place to start the open entry project

00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:15,359
feel free to contribute to the issue

00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:17,730
queue we're currently in beta 3 beta 4

00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:19,859
is going to be out probably today and

00:43:17,730 --> 00:43:22,230
we're looking for a public release later

00:43:19,859 --> 00:43:24,660
this fall so we're still doing a lot of

00:43:22,230 --> 00:43:26,820
development a lot of bug fixes and just

00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:28,320
a lot of tweaks and improvements so if

00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:30,840
you find little bugs feel free to

00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:32,250
contribute them to the issue queue if

00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:33,930
you want to get involved in development

00:43:32,250 --> 00:43:36,840
and fix some of those bugs that would be

00:43:33,930 --> 00:43:38,400
also awesome we've got an email list

00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:41,280
opening treatment phase two technology

00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:43,440
calm there's an IRC chat for people to

00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:45,720
kind of help each other at hashed open

00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:50,070
atrium and you can follow us on twitter

00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:52,680
at so that's it now we'll we'll take

00:43:50,070 --> 00:43:56,010
some questions here so go over to the

00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:58,830
question for question area and I'll try

00:43:56,010 --> 00:44:01,530
to read through some of these here great

00:43:58,830 --> 00:44:04,500
and and for those that have raised their

00:44:01,530 --> 00:44:06,570
hand using the control panel if you

00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:09,510
could just put your question and the

00:44:06,570 --> 00:44:11,430
questions portion of the control panel

00:44:09,510 --> 00:44:15,510
then might can just answer the question

00:44:11,430 --> 00:44:17,640
that way yep so let's see the first

00:44:15,510 --> 00:44:20,130
question comes from one asks about only

00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:21,990
two responsive technologies so yeah

00:44:20,130 --> 00:44:24,050
makino a two mobile accessible is

00:44:21,990 --> 00:44:26,609
definitely one of our big goals in oa2

00:44:24,050 --> 00:44:28,830
you'll the the theme that we're using is

00:44:26,609 --> 00:44:31,020
actually a based on bootstrap and

00:44:28,830 --> 00:44:34,050
bootstrap is a CSS framework that exists

00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:38,160
beyond just Drupal out there that's for

00:44:34,050 --> 00:44:40,080
doing responsive teeny we're using the

00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:42,359
radix team that was made for palapa lis

00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:43,500
using bootstrap and we've extended that

00:44:42,359 --> 00:44:45,359
quite a bit

00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:46,500
it doesn't fully work right now that's

00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:48,630
something we're working on in the beta

00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:51,300
is making things like the toolbar across

00:44:48,630 --> 00:44:53,030
the top properly collapse we're gonna be

00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:55,050
actually doing I think some fun

00:44:53,030 --> 00:44:57,089
cutting-edge mobile stuff with this

00:44:55,050 --> 00:44:58,440
theme here soon so definitely keep an

00:44:57,089 --> 00:44:59,910
eye out for that but the idea is that

00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:02,940
yeah people use their mobile device

00:44:59,910 --> 00:45:06,990
these days and using atrium with mobile

00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:09,660
was a big design requirement then you

00:45:06,990 --> 00:45:11,099
know and then I'm I'm sorry one asks

00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:13,440
another great question which is with the

00:45:11,099 --> 00:45:15,510
arrival of Drupal 8 the migration plan

00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:17,670
will be easy well I don't know that I

00:45:15,510 --> 00:45:19,950
would put easy there it's gonna be like

00:45:17,670 --> 00:45:21,470
any other large Drupal upgrade anytime

00:45:19,950 --> 00:45:23,609
you go from one major version to another

00:45:21,470 --> 00:45:26,760
whether it's trying to go from atrium

00:45:23,609 --> 00:45:29,700
one to atrium two and v6 to d7 or from

00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:33,240
d7 to D to d8 there's always going to be

00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:36,810
issues there mostly with controls atrium

00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:38,790
is a fairly large distribution we have

00:45:36,810 --> 00:45:42,060
over a hundred and forty some odd

00:45:38,790 --> 00:45:44,280
modules in atrium so obviously those

00:45:42,060 --> 00:45:46,110
modules have to be updated for d8 so

00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:49,140
things like organic groups

00:45:46,110 --> 00:45:51,420
analyzer and obviously a lot of uses in

00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:52,590
Cornell but a lot of the modules that

00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:54,600
are used in atrium we're going to need

00:45:52,590 --> 00:45:56,790
to wait till they're in Drupal 8 before

00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:59,550
you could migrate there with that said

00:45:56,790 --> 00:46:02,640
we have architected atrium 2 with 8 in

00:45:59,550 --> 00:46:04,760
mind with Drupal 8 in mind so in terms

00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:07,950
of how it's built from the ground up

00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:09,120
we're we definitely designed it so that

00:46:07,950 --> 00:46:12,300
we don't have to do another year-long

00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:13,770
development tasks for people 8 on once

00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:14,850
we decide the modules are stable enough

00:46:13,770 --> 00:46:16,380
but you're probably looking at a couple

00:46:14,850 --> 00:46:19,050
years before the modules are stable

00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:22,530
enough to really see atrium 2 on Drupal

00:46:19,050 --> 00:46:24,660
8 let's see

00:46:22,530 --> 00:46:27,120
Dirk asks how to create activity feed

00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:30,240
that aggregates specific sections of

00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:34,050
separate spaces so Dirk atrium is not

00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:36,570
designed to really aggregate specific

00:46:34,050 --> 00:46:38,370
sections across specific spaces you

00:46:36,570 --> 00:46:39,900
could certainly write a view a custom

00:46:38,370 --> 00:46:42,300
views that did that and you would just

00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:44,640
you know go to that exposed filter that

00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:46,470
we created and in the view you could

00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:48,630
select instead of making it exposed you

00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:50,580
could say make this one of and then

00:46:48,630 --> 00:46:53,940
select the spaces and sections you want

00:46:50,580 --> 00:46:55,770
but in general atrium is designed it to

00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:57,270
be kind of the little microsite thing

00:46:55,770 --> 00:46:59,910
where the spaces are independent of each

00:46:57,270 --> 00:47:02,400
other so the idea of aggregating across

00:46:59,910 --> 00:47:05,670
different spaces and then kind of

00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:06,870
cherry-picking sections within that is

00:47:05,670 --> 00:47:09,090
not really an out-of-the-box

00:47:06,870 --> 00:47:11,160
use case for each gym so it's certainly

00:47:09,090 --> 00:47:15,150
doable with Drupal but apply it to a

00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:16,320
little bit of extra work on that grant

00:47:15,150 --> 00:47:17,910
asks can you talk about the

00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:19,250
architectural changes Inouye to that

00:47:17,910 --> 00:47:21,960
replaced the functionality provided

00:47:19,250 --> 00:47:23,910
previously by spaces pearl and context

00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:26,000
modules yeah great question switching

00:47:23,910 --> 00:47:29,600
from spaces and context over to panels

00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:31,650
so obviously the depart of spaces and

00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:34,470
context that had anything to do with

00:47:31,650 --> 00:47:37,560
layout is all taken care of now through

00:47:34,470 --> 00:47:39,900
panels and panelizer and the in-place

00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:42,060
editor and all of that kind of those

00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:43,950
kind of modules so the alignments really

00:47:42,060 --> 00:47:47,010
left there are the kind of some of the

00:47:43,950 --> 00:47:49,020
space specific configuration stuff we

00:47:47,010 --> 00:47:52,170
created a module called OD variables

00:47:49,020 --> 00:47:54,720
which lets you create a plug-in module

00:47:52,170 --> 00:47:58,320
that exposes a variable that you want to

00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:59,790
have customized per space so when you go

00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:02,040
into your space configuration

00:47:59,790 --> 00:48:04,170
you can go into the variables tab and

00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:05,520
set the name of the variable so for

00:48:04,170 --> 00:48:07,710
example like let's say you wanted the

00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:10,440
site name to be different in different

00:48:07,710 --> 00:48:12,450
spaces I can go in the physics space and

00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:14,790
I could say I want my site name to be

00:48:12,450 --> 00:48:16,320
physics department and then instead of

00:48:14,790 --> 00:48:17,820
your global site name it would take on

00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:19,740
that value whenever you're in that space

00:48:17,820 --> 00:48:22,410
so again that was something that spaces

00:48:19,740 --> 00:48:24,540
did the Perl stuff specifically about

00:48:22,410 --> 00:48:26,760
doing custom domains is something we're

00:48:24,540 --> 00:48:28,230
still working on it's probably not gonna

00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:30,060
use Perl we're probably just going to

00:48:28,230 --> 00:48:34,020
directly use some other Drupal 7 hooks

00:48:30,060 --> 00:48:35,790
for altering the URL mapping but the

00:48:34,020 --> 00:48:38,850
idea is that yes we want to be able to

00:48:35,790 --> 00:48:41,130
let you provide a domain name per space

00:48:38,850 --> 00:48:44,150
so that for example the physics space

00:48:41,130 --> 00:48:48,180
would be you know physics university dot

00:48:44,150 --> 00:48:50,580
needy you instead of slash slash physics

00:48:48,180 --> 00:48:51,120
or whatever it is him so it's almost

00:48:50,580 --> 00:48:52,530
there

00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:55,680
most of it's there it's just not the

00:48:52,530 --> 00:48:57,870
domain stuff yet Derek asks is there an

00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:59,940
upgrade path from one that's also a

00:48:57,870 --> 00:49:01,440
great frequently asked question I'm

00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:03,210
sorry to say that with our limited

00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:04,860
resources we did not generally solve the

00:49:03,210 --> 00:49:07,080
problem of how you upgrade rupal six to

00:49:04,860 --> 00:49:09,630
Drupal seven and sorry that's a little

00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:11,430
bit of a joke answer but yeah we know

00:49:09,630 --> 00:49:13,530
that going from major versions of Drupal

00:49:11,430 --> 00:49:15,630
is is difficult it really depends on

00:49:13,530 --> 00:49:17,610
your specific site and what you've done

00:49:15,630 --> 00:49:20,400
specifically to customize it if you've

00:49:17,610 --> 00:49:23,430
got just plain Oh a one out of the box

00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:24,780
absolutely no customizations then yeah

00:49:23,430 --> 00:49:27,150
you're not gonna have too hard of a time

00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:30,480
we're gonna have migrated scripts to

00:49:27,150 --> 00:49:32,160
migrate your users and your spaces it's

00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:34,110
gonna migrate the blogs over to our

00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:36,480
discussions it will migrate the events

00:49:34,110 --> 00:49:37,980
it will migrate the the old notebook

00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:40,230
functionality into our new document

00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:42,060
pages what a moat what it will not

00:49:40,230 --> 00:49:43,770
migrate is the case tracker stuff

00:49:42,060 --> 00:49:46,680
because there is no case tracker module

00:49:43,770 --> 00:49:47,970
in open atrium - which is mainly because

00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:50,730
there's no case tracker module really

00:49:47,970 --> 00:49:52,980
stable for d7 at all yet there is a

00:49:50,730 --> 00:49:54,960
contributed module by David snow pick

00:49:52,980 --> 00:49:57,480
out on the project page for atrium

00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:59,250
called work tracker which is kind of his

00:49:57,480 --> 00:50:02,010
attempt to create a little issue tracker

00:49:59,250 --> 00:50:04,140
for atrium so he might do some migration

00:50:02,010 --> 00:50:06,210
for that but that's pretty much up to up

00:50:04,140 --> 00:50:08,400
to the plug-in maintainer x' to do those

00:50:06,210 --> 00:50:10,220
migrations obviously if you've done any

00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:12,540
kind of customization to your spaces

00:50:10,220 --> 00:50:13,560
that's done completely differently you

00:50:12,540 --> 00:50:16,500
know we can't migrate

00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:18,720
the the spaces and context stuff over

00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:20,460
into panels so you'll have to you know

00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:21,990
redo all your layouts and those kinds of

00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:27,690
things but your your data should come

00:50:21,990 --> 00:50:29,220
across with migrate module um let's see

00:50:27,690 --> 00:50:30,840
Nathan asks how about something like the

00:50:29,220 --> 00:50:32,370
relationship module to tie content

00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:34,920
together I'm not sure what you're

00:50:32,370 --> 00:50:37,340
getting at there so you might follow up

00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:40,020
that with a more specific use case

00:50:37,340 --> 00:50:42,000
Keith's asks is when adding content from

00:50:40,020 --> 00:50:44,040
the admin toolbar very top where does

00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:50,900
the toolbar get the content types

00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:53,460
so from the admin bar let's see like

00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:55,440
let's see the stupid pop-up is still on

00:50:53,460 --> 00:50:58,680
my screen so I can't we're not gonna go

00:50:55,440 --> 00:51:00,990
back and share the screen here so the

00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:03,720
admin button that's in the upper left

00:51:00,990 --> 00:51:06,870
that you saw me using that is just the

00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:10,100
Drupal's at the menu because i was

00:51:06,870 --> 00:51:13,500
logged in as the admin user right so

00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:14,760
that when you say add content is just

00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:17,040
going to take you to the normal Drupal

00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:19,350
add content page and it's gonna show you

00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:21,600
you know all your content types that

00:51:19,350 --> 00:51:23,130
plus button that I was clicking which is

00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:25,290
up in the toolbar more on the right hand

00:51:23,130 --> 00:51:27,720
side that plus button is kind of what we

00:51:25,290 --> 00:51:30,990
call the contextually aware add content

00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:33,120
button and it knows what kind of content

00:51:30,990 --> 00:51:36,690
your sections and your space is except

00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:38,310
and so it knows like oh I'm in the event

00:51:36,690 --> 00:51:40,920
calendar section therefore I should

00:51:38,310 --> 00:51:43,110
allow you to create events just like it

00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:44,760
was allowing us to create tasks when

00:51:43,110 --> 00:51:47,610
you're in a task section and that's

00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:50,220
controlled by those taxonomy terms for

00:51:47,610 --> 00:51:52,410
your section and space type so you can

00:51:50,220 --> 00:51:56,850
go edit those terms and check more boxes

00:51:52,410 --> 00:51:58,500
and add more options to that ricardo

00:51:56,850 --> 00:52:00,570
asks is there a guide like you showed us

00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:02,400
today available somewhere so yeah you

00:52:00,570 --> 00:52:03,930
mentioned it at the beginning the so if

00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:06,240
you go to the slides which I'm sure will

00:52:03,930 --> 00:52:08,430
be available there's that products phase

00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:10,250
two dot technology comm site where we

00:52:08,430 --> 00:52:15,090
have all of our technical documentation

00:52:10,250 --> 00:52:16,260
and it talks about a lot of this Nathan

00:52:15,090 --> 00:52:18,330
asked so what is the process of

00:52:16,260 --> 00:52:20,550
upgrading within the relay cycle ie beta

00:52:18,330 --> 00:52:23,250
3 to beta 4 so yeah one of the things

00:52:20,550 --> 00:52:25,710
about data that we're guaranteeing is

00:52:23,250 --> 00:52:27,089
that there is upgrade between beta if

00:52:25,710 --> 00:52:29,910
you're on alpha we

00:52:27,089 --> 00:52:32,130
provide any any real guidance for alphas

00:52:29,910 --> 00:52:34,440
but now that we are in beta status if

00:52:32,130 --> 00:52:35,789
you're on a beta release when a new beta

00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:37,739
comes out you'll just download the new

00:52:35,789 --> 00:52:40,710
beta and overwrite your existing files

00:52:37,739 --> 00:52:42,989
with it and run the Drupal update dot

00:52:40,710 --> 00:52:45,239
PHP script and you should be good to go

00:52:42,989 --> 00:52:47,069
if I've taped that PHP doesn't work

00:52:45,239 --> 00:52:49,979
there's some a couple of the modules are

00:52:47,069 --> 00:52:51,210
starting to use some specific version

00:52:49,979 --> 00:52:53,729
checks where they're looking for like

00:52:51,210 --> 00:52:54,809
certain versions of views and things and

00:52:53,729 --> 00:52:57,210
I've noticed that that can sometimes

00:52:54,809 --> 00:52:59,549
block the update dot PHP from working

00:52:57,210 --> 00:53:01,979
and so in that case you might have to

00:52:59,549 --> 00:53:03,690
resort to using any brush if you haven't

00:53:01,979 --> 00:53:07,559
used rest before that will ago learned

00:53:03,690 --> 00:53:10,380
rush but drush has a up d beach man

00:53:07,559 --> 00:53:12,569
which runs that update script and is it

00:53:10,380 --> 00:53:14,130
blocked by those version errors I'm

00:53:12,569 --> 00:53:15,960
hoping I'm hoping that things will get

00:53:14,130 --> 00:53:17,729
fixed with the update script so that's

00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:20,130
not a problem in the future but I've

00:53:17,729 --> 00:53:21,390
noticed it when doing it myself and so

00:53:20,130 --> 00:53:22,829
same thing when the final release comes

00:53:21,390 --> 00:53:25,469
out he'll just get on load that release

00:53:22,829 --> 00:53:29,249
and overwrite all your existing files

00:53:25,469 --> 00:53:32,400
with it Ryan asks are there any plans to

00:53:29,249 --> 00:53:33,960
add a follow feature for users so yeah

00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:36,719
Ryan right now you can actually do that

00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:39,479
the the widgets there in atrium one are

00:53:36,719 --> 00:53:42,029
in there an atrium to right now lets you

00:53:39,479 --> 00:53:44,460
customize your user dashboard so if I

00:53:42,029 --> 00:53:46,259
wanted to follow you for example I can

00:53:44,460 --> 00:53:48,839
customize my dashboard and I could add a

00:53:46,259 --> 00:53:51,299
recent activity view widget and I could

00:53:48,839 --> 00:53:53,190
set the user to be you know Ryan and

00:53:51,299 --> 00:53:55,829
that would show me all of your posts and

00:53:53,190 --> 00:53:57,299
so in a sense that's following users in

00:53:55,829 --> 00:54:00,029
terms of making that a little bit easier

00:53:57,299 --> 00:54:02,009
into kind of a one-click button it's on

00:54:00,029 --> 00:54:03,329
the roadmap I think for the future but

00:54:02,009 --> 00:54:07,079
not necessarily something that we're

00:54:03,329 --> 00:54:09,150
doing for the first release Derek says

00:54:07,079 --> 00:54:10,410
release date of to only official stable

00:54:09,150 --> 00:54:14,039
I mentioned that it's going to be this

00:54:10,410 --> 00:54:15,029
fall so q4 that's as specific as we're

00:54:14,039 --> 00:54:16,829
gonna get at this point

00:54:15,029 --> 00:54:20,009
I want to make sure it's ready before we

00:54:16,829 --> 00:54:21,630
release it Ryan asks are there plans to

00:54:20,009 --> 00:54:23,759
add more fields to user profile around

00:54:21,630 --> 00:54:25,559
skills and ability like LinkedIn so the

00:54:23,759 --> 00:54:26,910
the user profile area is another area

00:54:25,559 --> 00:54:28,920
we're trying to improve for release

00:54:26,910 --> 00:54:31,170
right now there isn't even really a

00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:33,859
profile tab there's the user dashboard

00:54:31,170 --> 00:54:36,509
and there's the users activity screen

00:54:33,859 --> 00:54:38,430
but there's no fields like you mentioned

00:54:36,509 --> 00:54:40,440
for for bio or skills or abilities

00:54:38,430 --> 00:54:40,980
we're probably gonna provide a tab for

00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:42,960
that but there

00:54:40,980 --> 00:54:44,760
allow you to basically customize that

00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:47,310
yourself because different different

00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:49,140
sites are gonna need different different

00:54:47,310 --> 00:54:50,700
field requirements there but it should

00:54:49,140 --> 00:54:53,130
just be a matter of adding fields to

00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:55,260
your user entity just like you do

00:54:53,130 --> 00:54:57,750
normally in Drupal and have them show up

00:54:55,260 --> 00:55:01,080
there so we'll probably have support for

00:54:57,750 --> 00:55:02,640
the basic you know description or bio we

00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:06,450
already have support for the users

00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:07,800
picture avatar picture but that's you

00:55:06,450 --> 00:55:08,910
know we may have an organization field

00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:13,200
but we're probably not going to get too

00:55:08,910 --> 00:55:15,210
specific on that I Kelly asked well this

00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:17,130
recording to be posted online and I'm

00:55:15,210 --> 00:55:20,010
sure I can answer that for Megan and say

00:55:17,130 --> 00:55:24,450
absolutely yes so you'll get a link for

00:55:20,010 --> 00:55:26,250
that once it's up David asks which is

00:55:24,450 --> 00:55:28,200
the module in d7 that displays the node

00:55:26,250 --> 00:55:33,450
publishing settings and so on the right

00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:36,470
sidebar like d8 not quite sure exactly

00:55:33,450 --> 00:55:40,830
what you're talking about there David

00:55:36,470 --> 00:55:42,359
the I I have not done a whole lot of d8

00:55:40,830 --> 00:55:44,580
stuff yet so I'm not sure exactly what

00:55:42,359 --> 00:55:45,720
you're referring to so sorry I can help

00:55:44,580 --> 00:55:47,010
you with that that's not really no way

00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:48,630
to question if there's a module that

00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:52,859
displays that it would certainly work

00:55:48,630 --> 00:55:55,410
fine with away if it supports panels and

00:55:52,859 --> 00:55:57,090
then Ryan says hi if I was used to use

00:55:55,410 --> 00:55:59,430
this for education could one use a space

00:55:57,090 --> 00:56:02,609
for course syllabus and a section three

00:55:59,430 --> 00:56:05,430
to this week's assignments yeah so

00:56:02,609 --> 00:56:06,630
typically I mean you would you could

00:56:05,430 --> 00:56:09,300
definitely do that what I would actually

00:56:06,630 --> 00:56:11,250
do is so we also support subspaces so

00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:13,500
spaces can have a full hierarchy you can

00:56:11,250 --> 00:56:16,260
have spaces with subspaces and then at

00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:19,200
the very bottom of the section is used

00:56:16,260 --> 00:56:21,330
to create little private areas so if if

00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:23,820
your weekly assignments you needed some

00:56:21,330 --> 00:56:26,700
kind of privacy where some weeks you

00:56:23,820 --> 00:56:27,750
have assignments for one team and some

00:56:26,700 --> 00:56:29,070
of the weeks you have assignments for a

00:56:27,750 --> 00:56:30,810
different team and you want to keep

00:56:29,070 --> 00:56:34,230
those separate them sections would be

00:56:30,810 --> 00:56:36,150
good for that and your syllabus your

00:56:34,230 --> 00:56:39,570
course syllabus would probably be a sub

00:56:36,150 --> 00:56:41,130
space within a space for your like in

00:56:39,570 --> 00:56:42,390
education we were talking like the

00:56:41,130 --> 00:56:42,869
physics department or the chemistry

00:56:42,390 --> 00:56:45,119
department

00:56:42,869 --> 00:56:46,230
you know those would be spaces and then

00:56:45,119 --> 00:56:48,030
within the physics or chemistry

00:56:46,230 --> 00:56:51,240
department you would have a sub space

00:56:48,030 --> 00:56:53,220
for courses you then you might have sub

00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:54,840
spaces for each course you know

00:56:53,220 --> 00:56:56,490
chemistry 101 or something

00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:58,590
and then within that subspace you would

00:56:56,490 --> 00:56:59,760
then have sections for the different

00:56:58,590 --> 00:57:01,230
weeks assignments and a little

00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:03,300
discussion board where your students

00:57:01,230 --> 00:57:05,820
could could you know exchange homework

00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:11,250
questions and stuff like that so yeah

00:57:05,820 --> 00:57:15,680
that's definitely a good news case let's

00:57:11,250 --> 00:57:15,680
see I think that is all the questions

00:57:16,610 --> 00:57:20,190
okay

00:57:17,990 --> 00:57:25,260
certainly a lot of questions this is

00:57:20,190 --> 00:57:28,410
clearly a really hot topic this time the

00:57:25,260 --> 00:57:29,880
last question goes to Dirk Dirk says

00:57:28,410 --> 00:57:32,850
does solar search add increased

00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:35,640
functionality to a to search so a great

00:57:32,850 --> 00:57:37,560
question a way to supports solar out of

00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:40,620
the box so you can either do triple

00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:42,990
search or solar search we fully support

00:57:40,620 --> 00:57:53,550
the solar search facets so you can have

00:57:42,990 --> 00:57:55,740
search facets so yeah okay great well

00:57:53,550 --> 00:57:57,510
Mike thank you so much for taking the

00:57:55,740 --> 00:58:00,810
time to go through this presentation

00:57:57,510 --> 00:58:03,630
today and answer all these questions you

00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:04,950
know I think the obviously open atrium

00:58:03,630 --> 00:58:07,020
is used around the world and a lot of

00:58:04,950 --> 00:58:11,250
different applications you know a lot of

00:58:07,020 --> 00:58:12,720
different solutions and you know as an

00:58:11,250 --> 00:58:14,490
end user I know I've been given

00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:16,620
different kinds of productivity tools to

00:58:14,490 --> 00:58:18,630
use but sometimes it just does it just

00:58:16,620 --> 00:58:20,760
wasn't tailored to my organization and

00:58:18,630 --> 00:58:22,230
the roles and that workflow and you know

00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:23,730
it's just really hard to adopt it like

00:58:22,230 --> 00:58:25,680
that so i think open atrium is really

00:58:23,730 --> 00:58:27,330
powerful because a developer can

00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:29,040
customize it and really show the client

00:58:27,330 --> 00:58:31,950
that they understand the client and

00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:33,600
tailor it to their needs and and hey

00:58:31,950 --> 00:58:37,140
it's built in drupal so that's even

00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:39,030
better yep exactly want to make it

00:58:37,140 --> 00:58:40,350
really easy to use this one cuz

00:58:39,030 --> 00:58:42,180
everyone's got different needs you know

00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:43,830
it's there's not gonna be now the Box

00:58:42,180 --> 00:58:45,870
one solution for everybody and that's

00:58:43,830 --> 00:58:48,030
kind of the way you open atrium one was

00:58:45,870 --> 00:58:50,090
presented and we just realized that that

00:58:48,030 --> 00:58:52,250
just wasn't solving people's needs so

00:58:50,090 --> 00:58:55,410
yeah this is great

00:58:52,250 --> 00:58:59,400
really exciting well then let me go

00:58:55,410 --> 00:59:01,620
ahead and just kind of close it out here

00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:03,690
for anyone that still has questions feel

00:59:01,620 --> 00:59:06,620
free to either type them in or you can

00:59:03,690 --> 00:59:09,050
shoot me or Mike and email

00:59:06,620 --> 00:59:10,520
and we'll make sure they get answered

00:59:09,050 --> 00:59:12,260
either directly or we could do a blog

00:59:10,520 --> 00:59:16,160
post back to the community off the

00:59:12,260 --> 00:59:18,500
Drupal Association news and but I just

00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:20,660
wanted to remind everyone I'm sure most

00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:23,210
of your developers but if you're also a

00:59:20,660 --> 00:59:25,850
freelancer or you're part of the sales

00:59:23,210 --> 00:59:28,340
team at your company you I encourage you

00:59:25,850 --> 00:59:30,620

Foods made his decision and how you

00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:40,400
could also help someone like him
