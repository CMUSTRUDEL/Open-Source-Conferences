00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:18,620
um and it John likes really strong tea

00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:21,200
so that's fantastic hopefully will you

00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:24,320
will need any to get get started on this

00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:27,860
boner so without further ado John I'm

00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:31,989
going to switch the presenter mode to

00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:31,989
you so you can start the presentation

00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:43,720
okay hey can you see my screen um yes

00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:50,480
okay I can you say that is the Drupal

00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:54,320
site yep yeah okay oh thanks Rachel on

00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:56,330
and so yeah this today's webinar is a

00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:59,630
got a security theme I'm gonna be

00:03:56,330 --> 00:04:03,380
looking at a couple of Adam modules or

00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:06,430
Drupal 7 to really beef up the security

00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:08,959
the site but it's about applying

00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:11,780
organizational security policies to to

00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:13,850
your websites and so the modules will be

00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:17,510
looking at our the auto logon module

00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:19,910
which limits the amount of time a user

00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:21,350
can remain inactive on the website will

00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:24,440
be looking at the session limit module

00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:26,120
which limits the number of times a user

00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,849
and login simultaneously to the same

00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:29,050
side

00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:30,970
and I'll cover a little bit of the

00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:32,800
password policy module which allows you

00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:36,400
to blur your organization's password

00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,990
policy to the to the river website will

00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:41,289
be looking at some settings within the

00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:43,030
flood control module and also the

00:04:41,289 --> 00:04:46,990
security review module which helps you

00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:50,169
to look for some common misconception

00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:53,050
website so i'll start with the auto

00:04:50,169 --> 00:04:55,750
logout module i also log out can be

00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:58,509
found on drupal.org at drupal.org /

00:04:55,750 --> 00:05:00,400
project / also logo if you'd like to

00:04:58,509 --> 00:05:03,849
test that out there's a link straight

00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:05,199
here to simply test of me which enables

00:05:03,849 --> 00:05:06,490
the side with the auto logon Roger

00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:09,400
already enabled and you can follow

00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:12,340
through the instructions on there that

00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:14,949
will be going through today so in order

00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:21,490
to enable the auto logout module you'll

00:05:14,949 --> 00:05:23,349
do that from the modules menu and an

00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:25,060
auto log out also has an integration

00:05:23,349 --> 00:05:26,979
with a second module called j/s timer

00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:30,759
which can be downloaded from drupal.org

00:05:26,979 --> 00:05:33,370
/ projects like years time javascript

00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:34,840
omelet module and we'll see how that's

00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:37,060
worth using the moment but it allows you

00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:39,699
to clutter o'clock on the site which

00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:45,370
shows how much time users got left they

00:05:39,699 --> 00:05:47,289
remain inactive with the auto logout

00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:48,940
module and GS Tyler modules enabled you

00:05:47,289 --> 00:05:52,810
can configure the auto login module from

00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:57,729
the main configuration menu and then the

00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:58,440
auto log out option under people you

00:05:57,729 --> 00:06:00,780
will Telegraph

00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:02,460
here the first one is the number of

00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:03,870
seconds that a user may remain inactive

00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:06,140
on the website this is the general

00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:08,900
setting and 1800 seconds in the default

00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:11,430
this equates to 30 minutes on the site

00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:13,470
some users are able to set their own

00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:17,130
waterlog app settings up to a maximum

00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:20,430
which you can provide here when a user

00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:22,350
session is about to expire they will get

00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:25,230
a pop-up alert asking them if they wish

00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:27,390
to continue their session and the amount

00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:28,860
of time that pop up alerts remains

00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:31,520
active on the screen pool is specified

00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:34,430
here in seconds so this is 10 seconds

00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:38,220
auto logger module allows you to specify

00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:40,470
auto logout times per roll so the

00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:42,030
authenticated user here has given 60

00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:45,660
seconds which is the minimum amount of

00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:47,130
time the users like to have the

00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:51,980
administrator anyone with administrator

00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:51,980
role is given 1870 as 30 minutes again

00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:59,040
you will be able to set the maximum of

00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:01,500
the messaging is where one module the

00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:02,940
pops up so with the configuration

00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:05,190
settings saved I'll return to the

00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:07,020
configuration screen and because we're

00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:08,040
going to put the timer on the page will

00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:10,080
have a look at the JavaScript time

00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:12,030
settings the JavaScript I'm assessing

00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,710
just needs this one setting set which is

00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:16,130
that it should load the JavaScript on

00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:16,130
every page

00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:26,320
if i look at my administrators settings

00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:27,760
they will get a new setting gear which

00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:30,220
means they can set their logout

00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:32,910
threshold themselves so the user one is

00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:35,740
set to 3600 seconds this is one hour

00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:37,120
with these settings saved whenever

00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:38,500
you're on the site on the left-hand side

00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,390
here we have a block which you can add

00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:42,460
from the structure blocks menu and it

00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:44,470
shows you the amount of time you have

00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:47,590
remaining within your session so the

00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:49,240
user one administrator has 5979 minutes

00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:52,180
remaining there as you browse your site

00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:55,600
is timer is reset there's also a button

00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:57,550
there for resetting the time I now log

00:07:55,600 --> 00:08:02,260
out the site I log back in as an test

00:07:57,550 --> 00:08:04,360
user the test user was only given is

00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:07,240
only an authenticated user and has only

00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:09,310
60 seconds for their period of

00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:12,060
inactivity so we'll be able to see when

00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:15,040
this timer counts down what the logout

00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:16,419
prompt looks like this is a good time to

00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:19,120
talk about some of the other features

00:08:16,419 --> 00:08:20,830
daughter-in-law bad module and the

00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,660
JavaScript's includes in the autoloader

00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:24,280
module detective users working on a

00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:26,710
forum so there is a particularly long

00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:28,780
form each time they interact with the

00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:31,570
form elements the job is the time work

00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:33,280
on the service I will be reset which

00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:35,409
means that if they have a form the may

00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:39,339
take many minutes to complete it doesn't

00:08:35,409 --> 00:08:43,900
block them out after after then working

00:08:39,339 --> 00:08:45,400
on that for an amount of time the the

00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:47,290
auto log at module also works across

00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:48,730
tabs so if you're working in multiple

00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:50,500
tabs on the same size as long as you're

00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:53,440
active on one of those tabs we will not

00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:56,230
be logged out of the sides so we have a

00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:58,630
few seconds remaining of an activity on

00:08:56,230 --> 00:09:00,790
this particular site when this counts

00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:02,650
down to zero will then get a pop-up

00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:04,540
alert asking if you want to remain on

00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:06,339
the site we say yes will be returned to

00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:08,560
it if we say no or we don't press it

00:09:06,339 --> 00:09:10,870
within the 10-second window and the user

00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:12,220
will be logged blogs out and they'll get

00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:13,810
a message when they return to their

00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:16,360
computer they will get an open see that

00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:19,560
they invoked out of the spot so that's

00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:19,560
the autoloader module

00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:23,519
module would like to go over is the

00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:25,589
session limit module this can be found

00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:27,570
on drupal.org and tripled org slash

00:09:25,589 --> 00:09:30,029
projects are shuttin session under

00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:33,290
school limit the session limit module

00:09:30,029 --> 00:09:36,630
allows a site administrator to restrict

00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:41,279
the number of active sessions a user can

00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:44,720
have on the site so I will start by

00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:44,720
disabling the author love their modules

00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:58,279
and then we will run a make sure the

00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:58,279
session limit module is enabled to

00:10:02,899 --> 00:10:06,540
configure the session limit module

00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:11,000
follow the links from the configuration

00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:13,200
menu and then session limit under people

00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,660
the first option is the number of

00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:18,660
defaults maximum settings sessions a

00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:20,310
user can have which is set to 1 this

00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:23,070
allows a user to log in once on one

00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:24,930
computer if they then log in more than

00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:27,270
one time the following actions may take

00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:29,279
place the default is do nothing this is

00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:31,649
the Drupal 7 default action this will

00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:34,829
allow users to log in and to as many

00:10:31,649 --> 00:10:37,380
work on sources they as many sessions as

00:10:34,829 --> 00:10:39,000
they like on the website the second

00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:41,130
option automatically drop the oldest

00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,260
sessions are prompting if they were to

00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:45,990
log in at home and then they logged in

00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:47,370
again when they came to work the session

00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:49,290
that was logged in at home being the

00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:52,350
oldest would then be logged out and so

00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:54,060
it couldn't be left unattended the final

00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:57,000
session earth setting is the prevent new

00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:59,700
session with this setting set if a user

00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,620
has logged in somewhere workstation one

00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:03,270
if they try and log in again the

00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:06,779
workstation to they will be prevented

00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:09,380
until they logged out to the first if I

00:11:06,779 --> 00:11:09,380
save these settings

00:11:09,779 --> 00:11:15,029
we will demonstrate how that works so

00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:21,060
we'll start by logging out of the site

00:11:15,029 --> 00:11:22,470
our login as the test user because this

00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:24,120
is the first session the test use

00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:25,439
allowed to log straight in and navigate

00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:27,029
around the site without any problems

00:11:25,439 --> 00:11:28,860
they are logged in in order to

00:11:27,029 --> 00:11:31,410
demonstrate the abilities of the session

00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:33,120
limit module I will use a feature of in

00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:37,189
Google Chrome called the incognito

00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:47,040
window incognito window works separately

00:11:37,189 --> 00:11:48,300
to the other google chrome window which

00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,819
means the sections aren't stored between

00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:53,730
them in this set in this window I'm not

00:11:50,819 --> 00:11:56,069
logged in if I now try and log in

00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:57,870
because I haven't logged in logged out

00:11:56,069 --> 00:11:59,730
to the first one I'm prevented from

00:11:57,870 --> 00:12:01,499
logging in and I see a section limit

00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:09,430
warning I must go back to my first

00:12:01,499 --> 00:12:11,140
session and logout now I'm not

00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:15,850
in the first session I can switch back

00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:19,930
to the incognito window and I should now

00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:24,790
be able to login to the site I'm no

00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:28,390
longer prevented from logging in so that

00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:31,300
was the session limit module the next

00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:33,670
module would like to look at is the

00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:36,160
password policy module the bottle policy

00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:38,310
module allows this as administrator to

00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:43,930
apply an organization's password policy

00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:45,430
to their Drupal 7 website drupal 7 07 by

00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:47,740
default does not have a bastard policy

00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:49,300
as such well you must have a password it

00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:51,720
doesn't specify a minimum length or

00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:51,720
complexity

00:12:55,779 --> 00:13:02,149
pass the policy can be configured from

00:12:58,430 --> 00:13:05,570
the configuration menu and then password

00:13:02,149 --> 00:13:07,339
policies under people the initial

00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:08,990
settings screen has a few options on it

00:13:07,339 --> 00:13:11,060
they'll be useful the first one is the

00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:14,180
force password change on reset so that

00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:15,709
when a user asked for a password reset

00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:20,140
when they've forgotten their password

00:13:15,709 --> 00:13:22,310
Drupal settings default action is to

00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:24,200
allows them to navigate the site once

00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:25,820
they followed the password reset reset

00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:28,279
link and they may not have reset their

00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:30,649
password by ticking this option you can

00:13:28,279 --> 00:13:32,000
enforce that once they if they have

00:13:30,649 --> 00:13:35,390
forgotten their password they are forced

00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:37,850
to reset it to a new one in order to set

00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:39,950
a password policy use the list tab at

00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:41,839
the top this site currently has no

00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:47,300
password policies applied will click to

00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:56,089
add a new one the password policy needs

00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:58,190
a name in the description you can then

00:13:56,089 --> 00:14:00,800
decide the roles that this that will

00:13:58,190 --> 00:14:02,260
apply this policy will be applied to so

00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:04,490
unless this allows you to create

00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:07,880
multiple password policies and apply

00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:09,230
different ones to different roles will

00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:14,300
be applying this to the authenticated

00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:16,250
user the expiration says session allows

00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:19,310
you to specify the number of days that

00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:21,350
are users password lasts for before it

00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:23,660
expires so perhaps or says it for 90

00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:24,980
days in the exploration warning we can

00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:26,450
set the number of days before the

00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:28,970
expiration date that the user will be

00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:31,760
reminded to change their password they

00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:33,529
will receive an email for this under the

00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:35,480
constraints section will be able to

00:14:33,529 --> 00:14:37,399
apply the password constraints which

00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:39,320
applies the policy to the bus to the

00:14:37,399 --> 00:14:40,610
passwords that people choose there are

00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:43,930
many settings in here which could be

00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:47,510
looked at later but some default ones

00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:50,570
are perhaps a password must have at

00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:54,380
least one digit it must have a length of

00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:56,870
6 must contain at least one letter and

00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:59,000
one piece of punctuation we can also

00:14:56,870 --> 00:15:01,430
specify the password cannot be the same

00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,620
as the username or Matt cannot contain

00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:05,250
the username by setting a oneness ballot

00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:09,570
in this box

00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:11,490
and the history option here allows you

00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:14,130
to specify that the past we cannot be

00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:15,960
the same as the previous X number of

00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:17,070
passwords so if we put one in there it

00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:19,460
cannot be the same as the previous

00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:19,460
password

00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:25,330
now that the policy has been created we

00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:27,770
must enable it by taking the enable box

00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:31,040
if you now want to ensure that all users

00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:33,470
of the site reset their password and in

00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:37,060
order to abide by this policy we can

00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:37,060
click the tab to force a password change

00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:42,530
we can ensure that users must change

00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,910
their password on first time login and

00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:45,800
we can ensure that all authenticated

00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:50,900
users I told they must reset their

00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:52,970
password their next login I was narrow

00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:58,700
log out to the side actual log in as the

00:15:52,970 --> 00:16:00,200
test user again the test user is told

00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:02,240
the password has expired and they must

00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:03,920
change it to proceed on the site if they

00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:05,960
try and navigate away they brought back

00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:08,420
to the Edit screen which is where they

00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:10,850
must reset their password after typing

00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:12,290
in their current password they must then

00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:14,150
type in their password and confirm for

00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:15,950
their new password and confirm it the

00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:17,390
password complexity settings we put on

00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:19,220
the previous page is shown below these

00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:21,350
replace the standard set the standard

00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:25,310
text that Drupal ordinarily prints out

00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:27,410
here each of the failures of the

00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:29,120
password is displayed below he replaced

00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:30,890
the same password in before and in fact

00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,300
it's the same as the username all of

00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:34,670
these things have been accounted for in

00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:37,700
the information underneath allowing

00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:41,510
users to understand what they have done

00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:43,670
wrong with their password this time I

00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:46,370
put a more complex password that didn't

00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:48,260
match the previous it does have capitals

00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:50,870
numbers and letters and punctuation and

00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:52,790
but it does contain the user name and so

00:16:50,870 --> 00:17:03,980
the auto policy module has noticed this

00:16:52,790 --> 00:17:07,270
and forbids this password once you've

00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:09,260
selected a good price would impress save

00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:11,299
module then allows you to navigate

00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:13,360
around the start

00:17:11,299 --> 00:17:13,360
you

00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:19,040
the next module I'd like to look at is a

00:17:15,830 --> 00:17:21,140
small one called flood control Drupal 7

00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:22,850
by default has flood control built in

00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:24,860
flood control prevents the site from

00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:26,300
being hacked by brute force where

00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:28,160
someone knows a username and

00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:29,630
continuously tries to log in by trying

00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,270
different variations were part of the

00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:34,910
password after a certain number of login

00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:38,210
failed login attempts flood control

00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:39,440
kicks in and locks that that attacker

00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:41,690
out of the site and prevents them from

00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:44,330
using the login form prevents them from

00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:46,460
trying to login any further these

00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:47,990
settings are hidden under the hood and

00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:50,240
Drupal 7 by default and the flood

00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:52,070
control module simply provides an easy

00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,690
way of accessing it it can be found on

00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:57,730
drupal.org under drupal org slash

00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:57,730
projects ashford underscore control

00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:03,320
after logging into the site the flood

00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:05,720
control settings can be found under

00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:09,560
configuration and under this under

00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:12,440
system flood control here are the

00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:14,450
settings the failed login IP limits

00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:17,270
restricts the number of failed login

00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:20,870
attempts from a particular IP or network

00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:23,050
address over the course of a time window

00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:26,600
which is the default is set to one hour

00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:28,520
the failed login username limit means

00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:30,560
that only five in this case only five

00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:33,860
failed logins can be provided by the

00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:35,390
same user / a six-hour period it may be

00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:38,090
there for your particular use case your

00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:39,770
particular site your clients on your

00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:41,390
organization these settings aren't

00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:42,950
appropriate the flood and the flood

00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:44,660
control module allows you to customize

00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:49,700
them for your particular organizations

00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:51,980
requirements the final modules would

00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:55,210
look at today is the security review

00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:57,800
module as a security review module

00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:59,950
provides some simple ways of checking

00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:03,560
for Miss configuration of your websites

00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:05,150
which can cause security problems afrin

00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:06,950
a the scrutiny model can be found on

00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:10,750
drupal.org at troubled org slash

00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:13,130
projects a security underscore review

00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:15,830
after enabling the security review

00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:20,150
module it can be very configured under

00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:21,620
the configuration menu and sorry reports

00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:25,210
can be found under the reports menu and

00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:25,210
then security review

00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:29,060
in order to review your site for the

00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:30,770
first time you brush the run checklist

00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:34,370
button and this checked recite for

00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:40,190
various common security vulnerabilities

00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:41,720
and configuration files listed

00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:43,010
underneath in the report anything red

00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:46,060
should be something it should be

00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:48,230
concerned about and something that

00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:51,020
should be corrected in order to make

00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:52,520
your site secure one example here is the

00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:54,620
errors are with into the screen in its

00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:56,270
default configuration Drupal print error

00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:58,280
messages to the screen which normal

00:19:56,270 --> 00:20:00,920
users can see sometimes these error

00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:02,060
messages contain security contains

00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:05,150
information which would allow an

00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:06,950
attacker to gain access to your site by

00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:08,540
following the links through we get to

00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:10,400
the error message configuration screen

00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:12,980
where we can then turn off these

00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:15,560
messages if this with the lies live site

00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:17,680
this is what we should be doing if we

00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:22,030
then return to the security review page

00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:22,030
and rerun the tests

00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:27,330
and we shall see the arrows written to

00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:29,330
the screen problem shouldn't have

00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:33,110
corrected itself

00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:34,790
a second place for the people security

00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:38,770
vulnerabilities on your site is the

00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:38,770
standard status reports clicker menu

00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:43,880
this provides a variety of information

00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:46,520
across your site and anything marked as

00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:50,060
either yellow or red is something that

00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:54,320
you should look into one of the main

00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:57,260
ones to look at is the site module

00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:59,440
information to see what modules are

00:20:57,260 --> 00:21:04,940
enabled on your site on which modules

00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:07,070
are out of date any listed as red will

00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:12,290
have a security patch on Drupal and

00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:14,300
should be updated immediately well thank

00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:15,680
you for listening that's taken me

00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:18,230
through the modules I wanted to talk

00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:21,620
about today and I pass back to Lauren

00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:23,810
there are any questions um we don't have

00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:26,570
any questions just yet so I'm going to

00:21:23,810 --> 00:21:31,250
ask a question really quickly if you

00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:36,260
have any concerns with securities for

00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:38,480
you know the the you know features you

00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:41,300
showed us today where can you find more

00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:46,160
information just to follow up and get a

00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:49,310
little bit more as far as detail for

00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:50,720
what you talked about and to the module

00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:53,270
pages of the best place to look I think

00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:55,040
for a particular information about the

00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:57,530
modules I've talked about today and the

00:21:55,040 --> 00:22:00,470
SU cues from drupal.org or a very good

00:21:57,530 --> 00:22:04,220
place to ask ask questions so if there's

00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:05,510
not a solution to the problem if you ask

00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:08,630
you a question on the issue queue for

00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:10,070
the module in question then the

00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:12,350
maintainer should be able to get back to

00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:15,230
you and give you information on how to

00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:18,520
solve a particular problem in terms of

00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:21,380
things like security there's

00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:24,140
announcements from the security team at

00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:25,520
which is available from Drupal dog you

00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:28,370
can sign up to the mailing lists there

00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:29,690
and in order to get the latest security

00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:31,340
announcements and if a module you're

00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:32,990
using on your site is mentioned in the

00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:37,550
security announcements you know that's

00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:38,690
best time to go ahead and an upgrade

00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:40,980
those modules to make sure you have the

00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:44,299
latest versions of them

00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:46,710
awesome it's really helpful thank you um

00:22:44,299 --> 00:22:48,750
we have a couple questions coming in

00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:53,540
John is there a limit to how many

00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:56,490
security modules and one should enable

00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:58,440
and there's no specific limits and

00:22:56,490 --> 00:22:59,669
there's no limit to a little bit they're

00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:03,330
no different from any other type of

00:22:59,669 --> 00:23:05,580
module on the site most the ones we've

00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:07,200
covered today aren't specifically

00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:08,850
security that they're not going to

00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:12,690
improve the security the site has such a

00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:15,750
more more about applying organizational

00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:17,790
policy so if the policy is that you

00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:19,350
should be logged out after an activity

00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:20,700
which which will make yourself safer

00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:22,740
because if you leave your cell on a 10

00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:24,450
logged in session unattended somebody

00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:26,190
else but then use it then things I've

00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:29,220
got a logout module in session in the

00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:30,690
modules are or good things to use so

00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:33,450
really it's about understanding your

00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:35,130
security policies and other of the

00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:36,900
organization or if you're a client at

00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:41,190
you're an agency of the planet or work

00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:44,730
with to make sure that you're you're

00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:48,590
applying the correct modules and allow

00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:52,440
those security policies to be fulfilled

00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:54,960
great thank you um next question if you

00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:57,900
turn off the error messages will the

00:23:54,960 --> 00:24:02,429
messages for invalid entries on web

00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:05,419
forms still be printed yes so this is

00:24:02,429 --> 00:24:08,160
that's the best kind of security

00:24:05,419 --> 00:24:09,630
development the development error

00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:11,970
messages that were turning off on that

00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:14,700
particular form so it's not the same use

00:24:11,970 --> 00:24:18,080
them and putting in a new connect and

00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:20,730
the all on this fall it's about printing

00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:22,830
development errors and accept the

00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:24,750
default configuration of Drupal 7 will

00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:26,549
print those out to the screen so unless

00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:30,929
you do that that setting within the

00:24:26,549 --> 00:24:34,140
configuration menus you might be

00:24:30,929 --> 00:24:38,309
printing our information that's in the

00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:40,620
user shouldn't be seen great um another

00:24:38,309 --> 00:24:43,230
question any advice for brute force

00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:49,530
logins and spammers regularly change

00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:50,970
their ips own yeah that's a difficult

00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:53,760
one and because the brute force noggin

00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:54,809
skin can be seen as either spam problems

00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:59,909
or they can be seen

00:24:54,809 --> 00:25:01,529
service problems denial of service it if

00:24:59,909 --> 00:25:02,700
it's a denial of service problem then I

00:25:01,529 --> 00:25:05,009
think you've got a bigger problem if

00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:06,659
that the websites actually being slowed

00:25:05,009 --> 00:25:08,850
down by the number body mount people

00:25:06,659 --> 00:25:12,480
trying to log in and then you need to

00:25:08,850 --> 00:25:16,220
look at ways to circumvent that via

00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:18,360
improving other infrastructure or

00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:20,340
potentially putting things out while you

00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:22,019
resources out to see the ends and the

00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:25,019
like which better than spread the load

00:25:22,019 --> 00:25:28,169
balanced in terms of trying to get away

00:25:25,019 --> 00:25:30,179
from the spammers and filling in spam

00:25:28,169 --> 00:25:33,960
forms and things like the capture module

00:25:30,179 --> 00:25:37,139
and do things to check that the person

00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:40,169
that is trying to log into the site is

00:25:37,139 --> 00:25:42,269
an actual person there's other modules

00:25:40,169 --> 00:25:43,889
like that and so that was capture but

00:25:42,269 --> 00:25:46,950
there's also honey parties and also a

00:25:43,889 --> 00:25:48,840
very good module as well which helps to

00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:50,429
identify that the person tried to log

00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:53,820
into your site is actually spammer and

00:25:50,429 --> 00:25:55,320
not a real person and there's commercial

00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:58,529
offerings as well and the likes of a

00:25:55,320 --> 00:26:00,179
modern and which can do go a little bit

00:25:58,529 --> 00:26:02,610
further where they don't prevent

00:26:00,179 --> 00:26:04,769
prisoner capture to start with but if

00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:07,139
what in filled in for instance if it's

00:26:04,769 --> 00:26:09,269
the comment form the bottom will make an

00:26:07,139 --> 00:26:11,129
intelligent assessment as to whether the

00:26:09,269 --> 00:26:13,200
person who feel we're folding is a

00:26:11,129 --> 00:26:14,279
person or not and if they're not they

00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:17,940
will then present them with the capture

00:26:14,279 --> 00:26:20,309
to go to be able to submit it so there's

00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:21,929
there's a number of ways you can look

00:26:20,309 --> 00:26:27,330
into a protecting your psyche against

00:26:21,929 --> 00:26:29,100
spam there's about of the great thanks

00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:30,720
John and the person that asks that

00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:33,149
question has actually a follow-up

00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:39,090
comment that says captures aren't

00:26:33,149 --> 00:26:40,950
available in the login form I'm pretty

00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:43,940
sure you can apply the catch to the

00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:46,169
login form and so I think if you have a

00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:47,549
can't think of a particular resource go

00:26:46,169 --> 00:26:51,600
to straight now but I've definitely seen

00:26:47,549 --> 00:26:52,950
captures and embedded into and most

00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:57,960
forms on the side that will allow you to

00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:59,869
do that and maybe they look that up and

00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:04,610
put the post information of our first

00:26:59,869 --> 00:27:06,970
great um iphone so thanks

00:27:04,610 --> 00:27:09,920
John the rest of our comments are just

00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:13,790
thank you for sharing sharing your

00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:17,150
advice on all these security situations

00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:23,570
and if we don't have any further

00:27:17,150 --> 00:27:26,030
questions looks like we don't just a

00:27:23,570 --> 00:27:29,600
reminder again coming up we have some

00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:32,679
