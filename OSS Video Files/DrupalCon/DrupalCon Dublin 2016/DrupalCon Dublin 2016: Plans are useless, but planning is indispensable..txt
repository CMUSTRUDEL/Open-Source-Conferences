Title: DrupalCon Dublin 2016: Plans are useless, but planning is indispensable.

Description: 
	"Plans are useless, but planning is indispensable." - Dwight D. Eisenhower

In this statement famously attributed to Eisenhower, the implication is that even a well made plan with the best intentions often ends up not being worth the paper it was written on, once the troops hit the beach and the situation moves from speculation to reality. When a plan contradicts the real world, the real world always wins. Knowing that even the best plan will almost certainly fail to account for at least some of the challenges reality poses, why do we plan?

The value of a plan lies in the act and effort of planning: in doing so, you gain understanding about your client, the project’s goals and objectives, and the abilities of your team. Planning encourages situational awareness through learning and discussing strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats and a flexible strategy that can tie them all together. A good plan establishes a vision, with goals and supporting objectives, and provides context and directionality so the team can move forward and be supported without being locked in.

Project success is rarely attributable to an accurate plan; it is more often a result of agility,  when the the team is aware of the overall project purpose and vision, and is empowered to make the best decisions based on the current circumstances. This agility requires the team to be constantly planning, evaluating, and re-planning.

In this session, I’ll unpack the quote above in the context of web development by looking at:

- How do we establish project purpose?
- How is that purpose communicated in the form of a plan?
- How do we gain alignment on project purpose from stakeholders?
- How can we be constantly planning?
- How do we gain and communicate awareness?
- How does the team make decisions based on that awareness?
- How do we gather and measure data to know how we’re doing?

	00:00:00,439 --> 00:00:06,330
so this is plan to use this but planning

00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,560
is indispensable this is a Eisenhower

00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:09,570
quote when he was a general back in

00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:13,019
World War two kind of talked about his

00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:15,410
philosophy when helping the troops kind

00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:17,660
of prepare for you know that traditional

00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:20,660
battle mode they are about to engage in

00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:20,660
and

00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:34,320
two

00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:43,120
so I kind of want to impact that quote

00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:46,210
today in the context of who I am and the

00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:47,680
work that I do I'm Sean and I work at a

00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:50,170
last column media where a creative

00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:52,300
agency based in the United States during

00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:54,460
the day the majority of my effort is

00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:57,880
spent running our agency's production

00:00:54,460 --> 00:01:00,130
efforts you know taking the business

00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:01,930
goals and the ideas of the people that

00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:03,309
we work with and translating those ideas

00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:05,080
and there's something that we can then

00:01:03,309 --> 00:01:07,360
deliver that has value at the end of the

00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:09,070
day and when I'm not doing that though I

00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,780
am also involved in the company's

00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:12,940
leadership initiatives right taking the

00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:14,800
company from where we are today figuring

00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:18,580
out where we want to go and how are we

00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:19,690
going to get there so last comida has

00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:22,090
been around for about seven or eight

00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:24,310
years during we went through a couple

00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:26,950
different iterations of who we are to

00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:28,600
get to where we are today but back in

00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:31,240
the early days when we were just two

00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:33,940
people now we're touching 30 I thought

00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:37,570
okay we need a process right we need a

00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:41,200
way to go from where we are to where we

00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:43,150
want to go and in talking to other

00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,280
people in the community other business

00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:47,830
people you know they said okay this is

00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,150
uh this is a solved problem you know you

00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:51,790
want to figure out how to maximize

00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:53,650
things like cash flow how to look into

00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:55,000
things like profit how you know you want

00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:57,490
to be a responsible leader within your

00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,020
organization you know answering all

00:01:57,490 --> 00:02:01,479
those questions you know got me really

00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:03,880
stuck trying to think of how do I think

00:02:01,479 --> 00:02:05,409
about all these things so I was stuck

00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:08,619
making excuses essentially

00:02:05,409 --> 00:02:09,790
procrastinating then you know business

00:02:08,619 --> 00:02:11,590
leaders like this is a solved problem

00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:13,060
right you just go to your local

00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:15,430
bookstore and you buy it for twelve

00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:17,470
dollars and you sit down and you write

00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:18,760
your five-year plan that's what you need

00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:21,489
to do take your business from where you

00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:23,739
are to where you want to go so I didn't

00:02:21,489 --> 00:02:26,019
have the before I make it sound like I

00:02:23,739 --> 00:02:27,100
can't stand the business plan right I do

00:02:26,019 --> 00:02:28,959
want to acknowledge that there is

00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:31,090
significant value in the business plan

00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:33,250
that I was not aware of or did not have

00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:35,830
the awareness of at the time when I was

00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:38,530
trying to to think about ways to chart

00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:40,090
the path forward right so to acknowledge

00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:41,350
that the value of the business plan and

00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:42,850
the value of right in the business plan

00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:44,739
is it's a series of essentially

00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:46,870
communication exercises that help you

00:02:44,739 --> 00:02:49,389
distill kind of what you're thinking of

00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:50,620
and help you think about things that you

00:02:49,389 --> 00:02:53,409
would not have considered as

00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:57,250
you were you know busy doing your day to

00:02:53,409 --> 00:02:59,290
day business but yeah to that end right

00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:01,510
it's important to have a vision to have

00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:02,890
those projections to engage in the

00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:04,390
questions of the business plan but would

00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:06,549
I use it in day-to-day business

00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:09,659
operations would I what I use it to base

00:03:06,549 --> 00:03:12,340
every decision off of Wright the idea of

00:03:09,659 --> 00:03:13,930
four years from now we want to be this

00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:17,019
type of company you know we want to have

00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:19,120
these fixed metrics right and along the

00:03:17,019 --> 00:03:20,799
way as you go through those the ebb and

00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,560
flow of reality you know you have to

00:03:20,799 --> 00:03:26,200
make different decisions right so as I

00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:27,940
try to write that business plan I found

00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:30,790
myself just you know with complete

00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:32,200
analysis paralysis right distracting

00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:34,510
myself with the business plan I was

00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:36,489
ignoring that you know not a hundred

00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:37,690
percent right but I wasn't focusing one

00:03:36,489 --> 00:03:40,030
hundred percent of my attention to the

00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:42,190
day-to-day realities of the business so

00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:43,989
i'm sure people in here have written

00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:46,390
five year plans either for an

00:03:43,989 --> 00:03:47,859
organization that they work for or for

00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:50,140
themselves you know who I as an

00:03:47,859 --> 00:03:52,930
individual want to be in five years I

00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:54,400
know it is interesting too there's an

00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:56,319
exercise to do in business school right

00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,760
where you we write a 20 year plan and

00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:00,370
then you put in a time capsule and I

00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,630
think you open it 10-15 years later but

00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:03,519
you're not supposed to look at it until

00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:04,900
then you know and talking to people that

00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:06,790
kind of went through that they're like

00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:10,419
oh yeah that thing fell apart after the

00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:13,299
first year but like I'm saying there's a

00:04:10,419 --> 00:04:15,639
lot of value in the act of planning just

00:04:13,299 --> 00:04:17,639
would not try to run my day-to-day life

00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:19,690
on the plan that I wrote three years ago

00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:22,300
but yeah it turns out that I'm not

00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:24,910
really alone here so kind of want to

00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:26,800
introduce one by fellow countrymen you

00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:29,289
know somewhat controversial have to

00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,970
acknowledge that you know at the time

00:04:29,289 --> 00:04:33,190
when he said this it kind of became an

00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:35,440
example of that politician doublespeak

00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:37,810
that turned you know when he said it

00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:40,330
became pretty famous on the on the late

00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:43,360
night shows as a joke right who is this

00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:45,039
guy and at the time was also incredibly

00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,530
frustrating to get an answer like this

00:04:45,039 --> 00:04:49,539
but if we kind of unpack all that and

00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:51,430
ignore the put you know the the

00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:53,650
political side of things and just really

00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:56,770
focus on what he's saying i think it's

00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:58,470
it's pretty there are known knowns there

00:04:56,770 --> 00:05:00,480
are things we know we know

00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:02,580
we also know there are known unknowns

00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:05,190
that is to say we know there are some

00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:08,220
things we do not know but they're also

00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:11,130
unknown unknowns the ones we don't know

00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:12,540
we don't know alright so what Roosevelt

00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:13,590
was really trying to say is that there

00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:15,870
are a lot of things out there that I

00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:17,670
don't know I don't know and and in the

00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:19,920
context for this was the hunt for you

00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:22,520
know bin Laden and the invasion of Iraq

00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:24,750
and Afghanistan and he was just being

00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:26,160
grilled by reporters who wanted to know

00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:28,440
like what was going on what the plan was

00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,480
right and he didn't know what the plan

00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:32,250
was because there were so many things he

00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:34,380
did not know he didn't know that he

00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:36,780
didn't know right so I faced these

00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:38,880
questions right as i thought to myself i

00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:41,130
have to write this plan you know this

00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:43,310
massive stream of consciousness you know

00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:45,360
what do i do if this plan changes right

00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:48,360
what do i do if i learn something new

00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:50,820
right what how can i adapt how can i as

00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:53,100
an organization change and take

00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:55,800
advantage of a new opportunity if i

00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:57,390
spent all this time and effort thinking

00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:59,130
this through in writing a solid five

00:05:57,390 --> 00:06:02,790
year plan that I am now committed to

00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:05,010
that I've now sold to myself do I follow

00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:07,350
that plan do I ignore reality or do i

00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:09,960
dapped do I need an answer for all the

00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:12,270
known unknowns and then you know lots of

00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:14,040
late nights trying to fall asleep what

00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:16,680
are all the unknown unknowns right as a

00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:19,890
as a small business to three people

00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:21,270
wanting to be 57 people thinking about

00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:22,500
all the different risks out there all

00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:26,970
the different answers that I need to be

00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:28,260
prepared for do I you know what are you

00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:31,169
know and then ultimately at the end of

00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:32,820
the day when you come into work who has

00:06:31,169 --> 00:06:34,380
fun just following the plan they wrote

00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:35,940
three years ago right I don't know if

00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:39,200
that's really something that gets me

00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:41,640
motivated up and out of bed every day so

00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:43,979
you know this is a guy named Kelly

00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:45,630
Kelly's the CEO and founder of last call

00:06:43,979 --> 00:06:48,919
and he's probably one of the most

00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:51,630
flexible guys I know very laid-back and

00:06:48,919 --> 00:06:53,550
one of these things I like to say is

00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:54,990
right welcome to Last comedia here's the

00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:57,030
plan for the next five years of your

00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:59,310
life and don't forget no delays or

00:06:57,030 --> 00:07:01,200
surprises and some of you may be like

00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:02,400
okay that no one ever says that right

00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:04,130
and others may be like i think i've

00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,630
heard that before i'm not sure where and

00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:09,349
that i think an example of that is the

00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:12,060
the US government that's pretty much a

00:07:09,349 --> 00:07:13,830
capital camp in government days

00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:15,030
23 I think three or four years ago I

00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:16,680
bumped into someone who had just

00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:20,880
recently been hired to work at a

00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:22,830
government agency in Washington DC and

00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,120
in the interview she was you know asked

00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:25,230
what do you know about agility what do

00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:27,090
you know about strategy we know about

00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:28,860
synergy right all those buzzwords that

00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:31,169
we hear all the time and obviously she

00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:33,990
nailed them she got them all great and

00:07:31,169 --> 00:07:35,430
was hired and they on day one they

00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:38,940
handed her a book and they're like this

00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:42,090
is the 200-page five-year plan for our

00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:44,250
digital strategy right and I don't I

00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:46,229
didn't bump into her i looked i go to go

00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:48,900
capital camp every year it's a great

00:07:46,229 --> 00:07:50,490
event in Washington DC and I haven't

00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:51,990
found her you know I don't know if she

00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:54,360
just abandoned the whole idea she

00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:56,010
couldn't navigate that rigidity or she

00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:59,520
was wildly successful now doesn't have

00:07:56,010 --> 00:08:02,150
time for capital camp but I the way I am

00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:04,860
still curious where that ended up so

00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:06,990
before kind of dive in you know I've

00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:09,180
been knocking the plan a little bit but

00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:11,639
it's important to acknowledge kind of

00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:14,190
why people plan you know despite the

00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:16,200
fact that reality often contradicts the

00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:20,430
plan people still find significant value

00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:22,740
in the plan you know I think the value

00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:25,470
of the plan is or has historically been

00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:27,600
that's how management thinks things get

00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:29,280
done right you you have a plan you make

00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,660
a task the larger the plan the more

00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:33,060
tasks it has those tasks are assigned

00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:34,830
you force that accountability management

00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:35,849
by objective you for the next three

00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:37,680
years they're going to do this this this

00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:42,050
and this and that's how we're going to

00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:44,130
be successful in this marketplace and

00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:45,510
management does that I think because

00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:48,420
there are certain forces at play that

00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:50,190
dictate that we plan right we have to

00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:51,600
know what we're doing so we have to put

00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:53,880
a plan together to figure out how we're

00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,980
going to accomplish that goal right just

00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:57,690
to solve an organizational problem we're

00:08:55,980 --> 00:09:00,570
often handed things like a budget a

00:08:57,690 --> 00:09:03,480
timeline and a statement of work or

00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:05,610
scope or some vision of that right and

00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:08,160
there are other I call these forces not

00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:09,450
constraints or any other word really

00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,190
because there are a lot of these things

00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:13,200
that you can't see sometimes right you

00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:15,060
may not be one hundred percent sure what

00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,070
the budget is or what the end product

00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:19,020
will look like and then you also have to

00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:22,620
balance that with things that are even

00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:24,660
harder to see like company politics you

00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:25,800
know that they're there and you just you

00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:27,019
can't ignore them you may

00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:29,370
that'd be able to define them exactly

00:09:27,019 --> 00:09:31,589
you know if I throw a ball up in the air

00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:32,970
and it doesn't come back down I'm not

00:09:31,589 --> 00:09:35,730
immediately going to think Oh gravity

00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:37,200
just must not exist today you know the

00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:40,440
ball probably got stuck in a tree or

00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:42,390
something else right and those forces

00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:45,060
that we have to constantly navigate

00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:49,500
shape the reality or what is possible in

00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:52,110
reality so it's a constant balance with

00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:53,700
between these forces right as a in a

00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:55,350
business right if you find yourself as

00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:56,399
in a business owner or someone who's

00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:58,829
leading a business you may have

00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:01,950
constraints or or forces such as cash

00:09:58,829 --> 00:10:03,240
flow and labor capacity right how do we

00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:04,910
work to balance those two kind of

00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:07,470
maximize the value of what we deliver

00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:08,820
right and I think there's an important

00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:11,100
thing to consider here if we start

00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:13,320
ignoring these forces right if we start

00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:15,180
ignoring company politics I think that's

00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:17,750
going to be one of the quickest ways for

00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:21,600
a project to lead to failure right and

00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:22,829
people are afraid of chaos I think

00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,750
ultimately at the other end of the

00:10:22,829 --> 00:10:26,579
spectrum when you don't plan and you

00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:28,470
don't have a mechanism for planning you

00:10:26,579 --> 00:10:30,750
know there's chaos right you can quickly

00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:36,120
a project or an idea or an organization

00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:37,890
can quickly fall on the chaos so I don't

00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:39,720
know anyone that likes chaos I haven't

00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:41,880
met a project manager that thrives in

00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:44,190
chaos or business owners seem to be

00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:45,930
allergic to chaos and you definitely

00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:47,579
don't want to be six months into a

00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:49,380
project and a stakeholder walks in the

00:10:47,579 --> 00:10:51,480
room and you know this is you know this

00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:55,260
thing is all sideways right stakeholders

00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:56,760
also don't like chaos and yet despite

00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:59,310
the fact that we spend a lot of time

00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:01,529
planning projects continue to turn

00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:03,360
chaotic right we we spent a lot of time

00:11:01,529 --> 00:11:07,829
we invested in that rock solid rigid

00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:10,470
plan we made six months ago but now what

00:11:07,829 --> 00:11:13,949
you thought back then is no longer what

00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:17,070
you're facing today you know in some

00:11:13,949 --> 00:11:18,810
projects that may be day one you walk in

00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:20,760
the room and some stakeholder throws it

00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:22,110
all out the window right so what do you

00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:24,269
do now what's the what's the mechanism

00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:26,310
do you go back to the drawing board do

00:11:24,269 --> 00:11:28,649
you write plan to point o do you invest

00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:31,890
all that time and energy in that plan or

00:11:28,649 --> 00:11:35,070
do you do something else right so I

00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:38,220
believe chaos comes from trying to force

00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:39,420
a simple process on something very

00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:41,430
complicated

00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:43,620
like software development right so

00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:46,920
traditional management is stuck in this

00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:49,140
mentality of build plan deliver right

00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:51,630
that's how we get things done but in

00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:54,080
reality there's feedback and there's no

00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:57,930
mechanism for feedback in this linear

00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:59,880
relay race of a model right this is the

00:11:57,930 --> 00:12:03,150
mentality here is I don't know or i

00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:05,010
think i know what i'm going to do six

00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:08,010
months from now so i want to be

00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:10,560
optimistic like I always am and think I

00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:15,600
got this right so let's plan build

00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:18,000
deliver full stop but I think in reality

00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:23,060
what ends up happening is it's plan

00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:26,610
build keep building budget overruns

00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:28,710
projects behind schedule chaos is there

00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:30,090
anyway so you're navigating now you're

00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:32,400
navigating all these different forces

00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:40,220
that have that have now really emerged

00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:43,470
and become chaotic so what we've decided

00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:45,600
and what I think is is a growing and

00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:47,880
really successful trending in the

00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,620
software development world is agility

00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:51,240
right agility challenges that model

00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:52,830
change is inevitable so let's stop

00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:56,250
pretending that we're never going to

00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:57,870
change anything and avoiding change and

00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:59,580
instead let's get better at it let's get

00:12:57,870 --> 00:13:02,160
faster at it let's let's encourage and

00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:03,540
embrace it right let's stop focusing on

00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,360
what we wrote six months ago just

00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:07,110
because we wrote it and we got you know

00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:09,000
politics involved within our

00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:11,130
organization got the commitment that we

00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:15,180
needed to move forward and it's a

00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:17,910
feedback loop right so inspect adapt and

00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:20,370
create and the key here is to create

00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:21,780
because as someone who works at an

00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:24,330
agency the people that we work with

00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:26,330
aren't going to pay for just for us to

00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:29,070
be perpetually inspecting and adapting

00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:30,690
constantly taking steps back constantly

00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:32,550
thinking about the bigger picture right

00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:34,260
there is significant value and all that

00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:37,010
but you have to ultimately at end of the

00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:40,380
day deliver something of even more value

00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:42,480
so when I think about things that last

00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:44,400
call I thought you know we should use

00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,320
this our ability to be adaptive

00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:48,680
adaptable as our competitive advantage

00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:51,180
right let's let's see how quickly we can

00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:53,190
be let's not see how quickly we can

00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:56,310
inspect adapt change course

00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:59,100
deliver right so today when I'm hoping

00:13:56,310 --> 00:14:01,290
we can all examine is how we can develop

00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:02,970
an awareness that enables us to be

00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:05,490
adaptable to deliver working software

00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:07,080
with the most value right and also at

00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:09,300
the same time acknowledge and balance

00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:12,870
those forces such as scope budget

00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:14,610
timeline and politics so I one of the

00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:17,030
things that I found over the years and

00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:19,800
how to be adaptable is to establish

00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:22,470
communication right so communication

00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:24,810
healthy lines of communication which

00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:26,700
will lead to an awareness and when we

00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:28,980
have that shared awareness we can

00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:30,300
discuss things like what the vision is

00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:32,220
for the project and what our goals and

00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:35,870
objectives are and in the context of all

00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:38,490
that we can adapt right so as we

00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:41,490
communicate have that awareness we can

00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:42,810
inspect adapt and create and I kind of

00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:45,180
tied that back to our mission statement

00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:47,520
at last call right here's a little bit

00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:49,230
about what we do we are a creative

00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:51,630
agency that enjoys work with purpose

00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:54,240
right building really valuable solutions

00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:56,640
to assist organizations in the arc and

00:14:54,240 --> 00:15:00,390
the communities they work so hard to

00:14:56,640 --> 00:15:03,810
support and despite how I seem so

00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:05,250
against the five-year plan we've done a

00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:06,960
lot of really amazing work for a lot of

00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:09,440
really great organizations solving

00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:11,430
complex creative and technical problems

00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:14,210
like I said we're basically the United

00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:16,770
States most of us are in Massachusetts

00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:18,900
I'm based out of Manhattan a few other a

00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:20,580
few of us are based in Baltimore and

00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:24,090
we're kind of a little bit distributed

00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:26,940
it's an idea that we're exploring so as

00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:29,100
I think about inspecting and adapting I

00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:31,050
also wanted to bring that same idea to

00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:33,570
our mission statement right so lost

00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:35,430
comedia we enjoy adapting to change over

00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:38,220
following a plan right from that agile

00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:40,980
manifesto to deliver the most valuable

00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:44,339
solutions and I that ties in a little

00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:47,030
bit to our website I don't know how

00:15:44,339 --> 00:15:50,400
well-known this is but we launched our

00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:52,620
current site and back in October of 2013

00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:55,680
and why this is much worth mentioning is

00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:57,000
because we built it on Drupal 8 so a lot

00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:59,130
of us here today are considering our

00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,830
next drew blade project maybe we have

00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:04,830
several jablay projects under our belt

00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:06,460
but back in October of 2013 the team sat

00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:08,860
down and we decided

00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:11,470
k alpha 8 we're going to start building

00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:13,270
this thing and when we launched it we

00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:15,340
were on alpha 12 and obviously now we

00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:16,660
all know where we are today right but I

00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:18,640
think that's a great example of our

00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:20,320
agility our technical agility right as

00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:24,520
things were constantly changing in core

00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:27,240
as the platform was maturing we had to

00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:29,920
constantly inspect and adapt and deliver

00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:32,290
Ellen something that's also really cool

00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:35,590
as we contribute a ton of code back so

00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:37,630
that's really important to us so the

00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:38,950
first point is communication you want to

00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:41,620
establish what it means to communicate

00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:43,600
right sounds like okay we've all been

00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:45,850
down this road before communication

00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:49,480
means checking in weekly setting proper

00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:51,340
client expectations and responding to

00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:53,290
emails promptly right I'd like to

00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:55,480
challenge that a little bit and I'm i

00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:57,550
believe healthy lines of communication

00:16:55,480 --> 00:17:00,130
is really all about developing strong

00:16:57,550 --> 00:17:02,380
interpersonal connection and then

00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:03,760
eventually that will lead to when you're

00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:05,800
delivering when you're inspecting and

00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:08,440
creating that will lead to trust right

00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:10,870
and that is absolutely critical because

00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:12,520
in software development we all know that

00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:14,050
there are these moments when things get

00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:16,270
a little chaotic right so we want to

00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:17,800
make sure that we can turn back and sort

00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:19,300
of fall back to that interpersonal

00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:22,870
connection that we have on a human a

00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:25,330
human level right so when we aren't

00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:27,670
communicating when we're ignoring being

00:17:25,330 --> 00:17:29,110
the worst possible thing you could do on

00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:31,780
a project that you're working on with a

00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:33,700
partner or a client you know we have to

00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:35,530
acknowledge that we're hired to make

00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:37,570
people's lives easier to make their

00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:39,010
lives better and when we decide to not

00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:41,200
communicate or not communicate the right

00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:43,750
amount they can turn around and actually

00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:46,210
make our lives a lot works right in the

00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:50,920
form of overruns and blown budgets and

00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:53,170
timelines so that little thing about me

00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:54,760
is what I'm not you know helping out at

00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:57,340
last call or go into cabs and

00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:59,020
conferences I'm a general aviation pilot

00:17:57,340 --> 00:18:01,720
so that means I spent a lot of time at

00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:03,810
5,000 feet and this is actually really

00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:06,280
interesting exercise for me because

00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:07,600
being and learning how to be a pilot has

00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:09,370
actually taught me to be a better

00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:12,130
communicator and therefore a better

00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:14,590
planner pilots are constant planners

00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:16,180
you're always evaluating your origin

00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:17,830
your destination and how you're going to

00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:19,280
get there and the conditions that you

00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:21,710
need to navigate along the way

00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:23,450
you know you often if you're flying

00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:26,210
somewhere may find yourself in a cloud

00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:28,700
right and so they don't trust me to fly

00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:31,850
the big jets like we probably flew here

00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:33,110
so i supply the little planes so when

00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:34,760
you're on a little single-engine plane

00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:36,470
and you're flying through cloud I know

00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:38,600
if anyone here has had that experience

00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:41,210
it's it's pretty disorienting you can't

00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:42,470
see anything one of the thrills of

00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:45,410
flying is that you're at a high altitude

00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:47,540
in here this amazing view but you end up

00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:50,450
in a cloud can't see anything so story

00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:52,280
hunting it never gets less the story

00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:56,630
enting experience can make it a little

00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:59,180
easier to navigate so in that context

00:18:56,630 --> 00:19:00,650
right when I'm flying and I am end up in

00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:03,830
a cloud do I just keep flying through

00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:05,900
the crowd or do I adapt so in an

00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:08,900
aviation there's the three C's right so

00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:10,280
you climb you confess and you comply so

00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:12,140
you find yourself with a new awareness

00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:14,140
you're in a cloud you don't know where

00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:17,000
you're headed you can't see anything

00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:19,850
what do you do you climb you immediately

00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,980
climb because a deep dive right like in

00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:23,480
software development is the most

00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:26,660
dangerous thing you could possibly do

00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:28,940
when you're stuck all alone you know no

00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:30,920
no diving into the weeds you want to

00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:32,540
climb maybe climb out of the cloud and

00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:34,940
gain some gain some of that visibility

00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:37,640
right you want to confess you want to

00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:39,260
communicate and be fully forthcoming and

00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:41,840
transparent about where you are and what

00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:44,630
your situation is hey I'm I'm you know

00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:47,420
at this location i'm heading in this

00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:48,980
direction i'm trying to go here and i'm

00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:53,090
in a bunch of clouds how do I get out of

00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:54,650
this you know and from there you'll

00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:55,790
often get some feedback that'll help you

00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:58,490
can't you know that you should comply

00:19:55,790 --> 00:20:00,800
with okay climb to 7,000 feet change

00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:03,560
your heading to this and after 30

00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:06,020
minutes you should be back and clear

00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:08,750
skies right thank you so much because

00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:12,440
there's nothing like late learning at

00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:16,730
5,000 feet when you thought everything

00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:18,200
was okay and then not to be but then you

00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:20,030
slam into the side of a mountain right

00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:21,440
so I don't know if you know in this

00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:23,120
analogy I don't know how many how many

00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,170
of us have been in a project where all

00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:26,420
of a sudden you thought things were

00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:28,640
going great you were on your heading and

00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:29,930
all of a sudden you did slam into the

00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:32,029
side of a mountain and you're like how

00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:34,239
did this happen we had the plan

00:20:32,029 --> 00:20:36,799
you know there wasn't supposed to be any

00:20:34,239 --> 00:20:40,219
rain or I didn't know I'd fly into this

00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:42,529
hurricane right so the value of the plan

00:20:40,219 --> 00:20:44,330
then is in the time spent planning of

00:20:42,529 --> 00:20:46,399
constantly communicating and constantly

00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:48,169
adjusting course right are you in a

00:20:46,399 --> 00:20:50,229
cloud are we in a cloud what are we

00:20:48,169 --> 00:20:52,340
going to do about being in this cloud

00:20:50,229 --> 00:20:54,619
acknowledging that the best plan is one

00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:56,509
that is likely to change even the best

00:20:54,619 --> 00:20:58,340
groove backlog the most solid user

00:20:56,509 --> 00:21:01,039
stories the ones that you spent months

00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:03,529
refining and everything is great you may

00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:05,869
not ever need to do those right so we

00:21:03,529 --> 00:21:08,359
need to reduce the impact that change

00:21:05,869 --> 00:21:12,019
has on what we ultimately end up

00:21:08,359 --> 00:21:13,549
delivering right so it's less painful to

00:21:12,019 --> 00:21:16,909
deliver significantly more value for the

00:21:13,549 --> 00:21:18,769
relationship so again when I when I

00:21:16,909 --> 00:21:20,509
think about the work that we do at last

00:21:18,769 --> 00:21:22,190
call and I think about what are our

00:21:20,509 --> 00:21:23,869
strengths what are our competitive

00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:25,909
advantage of advantage in the

00:21:23,869 --> 00:21:28,330
marketplace right our strength is in our

00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:31,369
ability to be constantly planning we are

00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:35,809
incredible planners we plan all the time

00:21:31,369 --> 00:21:39,049
we constantly inspect and adapt and we

00:21:35,809 --> 00:21:42,320
constantly communicate right so how do

00:21:39,049 --> 00:21:44,210
we communicate internally you know we

00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:46,789
have project teams we have a creative

00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:49,309
team we have several production teams

00:21:46,789 --> 00:21:51,200
that people work together obviously we

00:21:49,309 --> 00:21:52,669
assemble a team for the project they

00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:56,539
have daily stand-ups something pretty

00:21:52,669 --> 00:21:58,519
common we kind of require reviews every

00:21:56,539 --> 00:22:00,889
two weeks so we deliver what we've been

00:21:58,519 --> 00:22:04,580
working on every two weeks with the team

00:22:00,889 --> 00:22:06,499
and the the partner and I'd kind of like

00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:09,619
to challenge the traditional meeting

00:22:06,499 --> 00:22:10,909
structure for a minute here where you

00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:14,149
have this thing called like a weekly

00:22:10,909 --> 00:22:16,759
status where you check in and you know

00:22:14,149 --> 00:22:19,549
the team tells the project manager

00:22:16,759 --> 00:22:21,379
everything's going great right because

00:22:19,549 --> 00:22:23,089
in their current reality things are

00:22:21,379 --> 00:22:24,859
going great and then that just gets

00:22:23,089 --> 00:22:27,139
affirmed and affirmed and firm then all

00:22:24,859 --> 00:22:28,580
of a sudden the partner thinks things

00:22:27,139 --> 00:22:30,169
are going great and the partners boss

00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:31,879
and the partners boss's boss's boss

00:22:30,169 --> 00:22:34,249
things everything's going great when

00:22:31,879 --> 00:22:38,929
reality you just you're stuck in a cloud

00:22:34,249 --> 00:22:41,179
and you don't know what to do so at last

00:22:38,929 --> 00:22:44,059
call we did this quick audit so when we

00:22:41,179 --> 00:22:45,589
were small when we were to going on

00:22:44,059 --> 00:22:45,830
seven people we used to have an internal

00:22:45,589 --> 00:22:48,019
day

00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:51,440
company stand up that was actually a lot

00:22:48,019 --> 00:22:54,200
of fun we worked on develop strong

00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:57,830
interpersonal connections and as we grew

00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:59,659
to 20 people you know and they already

00:22:57,830 --> 00:23:01,309
had their daily stand-up with their team

00:22:59,659 --> 00:23:02,750
that they were on and then they left

00:23:01,309 --> 00:23:04,519
that stand up and then immediately went

00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:06,440
to another stand up right starting to

00:23:04,519 --> 00:23:08,299
sound a little silly but then they'd sit

00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:10,490
in that room and we'd have 20 25 people

00:23:08,299 --> 00:23:11,960
sitting around a giant table and maybe

00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:13,190
saying what they did yesterday what

00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:15,890
they're working on today and what

00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:17,779
they're stuck on and people weren't

00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:20,149
really listening right there just like

00:23:17,779 --> 00:23:22,580
an opportunity to to hang out and catch

00:23:20,149 --> 00:23:25,220
up so we did this audit right we wanted

00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:26,929
to inspect kind of what people got out

00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:29,480
of this meeting that just seemed to be a

00:23:26,929 --> 00:23:32,269
little silly so he passed around note

00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:35,659
cards and I'll keep this one anonymous

00:23:32,269 --> 00:23:37,909
but uh I really liked her point she says

00:23:35,659 --> 00:23:39,740
I like to stand up because I get to hear

00:23:37,909 --> 00:23:41,809
what other people are up to and it's a

00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:45,200
nice way to ease into the day is it

00:23:41,809 --> 00:23:46,880
useful I don't know it could probably do

00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:50,149
my job just as well without this stand

00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:52,130
up I just really like it and a plus for

00:23:50,149 --> 00:23:54,529
sentimental value a minus for actual

00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:56,570
usefulness so we gathered this from

00:23:54,529 --> 00:23:57,889
everyone that works to the company and

00:23:56,570 --> 00:24:00,200
we were able to pull some trends out of

00:23:57,889 --> 00:24:01,850
it Hey look people don't actually want

00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:03,460
this daily stand-up but they really like

00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:05,750
the ability to hang out and get together

00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:07,070
and talk about what they're working on

00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:08,870
how things are going for them right

00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:11,299
because they were humans and we need to

00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:12,919
connect on the human to human level so

00:24:11,299 --> 00:24:14,950
what we did is we all right we dropped

00:24:12,919 --> 00:24:17,779
the stand up right that was a pretty

00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:19,789
bold move and people weren't we didn't

00:24:17,779 --> 00:24:21,860
really like it but we brought introduces

00:24:19,789 --> 00:24:23,419
said you have a coffee klatch I don't

00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:27,169
know probably in this room there are

00:24:23,419 --> 00:24:29,179
some Germans but in college when I took

00:24:27,169 --> 00:24:31,070
German right we had this every wednesday

00:24:29,179 --> 00:24:32,419
at like six o'clock you could go to the

00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:34,250
German department you could hang out for

00:24:32,419 --> 00:24:36,169
an hour and the whole idea that was just

00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:39,049
to talk about tuck in German talk about

00:24:36,169 --> 00:24:41,539
whatever you wanted so every Wednesday

00:24:39,049 --> 00:24:42,590
at nine a.m. we bring in bagels and we

00:24:41,539 --> 00:24:45,409
have our own version of the coffee

00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:47,600
klatch and that worked out really well

00:24:45,409 --> 00:24:49,220
and then it was like okay we're doing

00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:51,529
this too much right we inspected and

00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:53,750
adapted again after about a month and

00:24:51,529 --> 00:24:55,010
now it's every two weeks and I'm kind of

00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:56,090
feeling like we're going to give it some

00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:58,480
time and then it will turn into a

00:24:56,090 --> 00:24:58,480
monthly thing

00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:03,270
but so we're talking about how we were

00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:05,340
able to get some meaningful data and how

00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:07,590
we were able to on a really simple level

00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:09,150
inspect and adapt and stop following our

00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:11,760
plan which would have been the stand-ups

00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:13,590
right three years ago we never would

00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:15,390
have thought that we would drop the

00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:19,140
daily stand-up the company-wide daily

00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:22,650
standup but kind of thinking about how

00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:25,440
we build teams at last call so a few

00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:28,020
years ago we came across scrum I'm sure

00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:29,790
some individuals in here who love scrum

00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:33,450
rely heavily on scrum and he scrum

00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:35,820
masters product owners awesome so this

00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:37,290
is all like oh I've seen this stuff and

00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:39,420
one of the things i find fascinating

00:25:37,290 --> 00:25:42,360
about them is what i learned them I

00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:44,820
didn't really okay those are cool keep

00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:46,110
those in mind but then like as I was

00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:48,360
thinking about how to build high

00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:50,010
performing teams I kept going back to

00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:51,570
these values and I think what's

00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:55,130
incredibly powerful about them is that

00:25:51,570 --> 00:25:58,320
there's no one answer for any of these

00:25:55,130 --> 00:26:00,720
you know focus when one classic example

00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:03,150
is on the task at hand right courage one

00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:04,890
of one of my favorite of the values is I

00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:06,180
need you to have the courage I need us

00:26:04,890 --> 00:26:08,670
to work together to figure out how to

00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:11,420
have the courage so you can be open and

00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:14,100
honest about if you're stuck in a cloud

00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:17,160
so don't have spend a lot of time on

00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:20,270
packing these it would be cool though if

00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:22,110
there were other there's like more

00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:24,990
conversation around these and the

00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:27,240
community in general there are two

00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:29,640
values that aren't on here that I've

00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:32,400
kind of found in the in the scrum

00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:34,500
community and in my own reflection on

00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:36,330
these values and that's trust and humor

00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:38,160
and I think the reason why they're not

00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:39,750
values is trust is something that is

00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:41,850
earned right you don't really want to

00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:43,560
trusting someone day one isn't really

00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:46,970
the best plan you should respect them

00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:49,650
and trust will be earned right as you're

00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:51,630
navigating chaos together and adapting

00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:53,460
to change and then humor right i don't

00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:55,950
know i mean everyone kind of has their

00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:58,200
own strategy this definitely sounds very

00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:59,970
corny but because when you actually say

00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:01,500
this out loud but one of the ways i

00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:03,150
found that really helps building

00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:06,600
interpersonal connection is by making

00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:08,190
jokes so yeah very corny to actually

00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:10,950
disclose that to a room full of people

00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:11,789
but you know not obviously don't force

00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:13,409
myself to

00:27:11,789 --> 00:27:16,340
make a lot of jokes right now my daily

00:27:13,409 --> 00:27:20,220
joke quota but when it comes up it's a

00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:22,649
really helpful so and then like finally

00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:24,570
in terms of communication right we need

00:27:22,649 --> 00:27:26,999
to be continuously improving as we get

00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:28,379
feedback on the project our teams also

00:27:26,999 --> 00:27:30,539
need feedback right how are we

00:27:28,379 --> 00:27:32,489
performing how are we liking this whole

00:27:30,539 --> 00:27:34,799
adapting to change thing when we rolled

00:27:32,489 --> 00:27:37,350
out scrum several years ago we had

00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:39,960
project managers who were so focused on

00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:42,720
that Iron Triangle and it was a

00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:45,649
significant it's a paradigm shift really

00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:48,989
and some scrum and some project managers

00:27:45,649 --> 00:27:53,070
couldn't shake it whereas others totally

00:27:48,989 --> 00:27:54,989
embraced it all right so as we're

00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:57,210
communicating following all these scrum

00:27:54,989 --> 00:27:59,489
values we're respecting each other Trust

00:27:57,210 --> 00:28:00,960
is building we have this new awareness

00:27:59,489 --> 00:28:02,909
now because we're so great at

00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:04,739
communicating right so that shared

00:28:02,909 --> 00:28:06,210
awareness allows us to kind of all be on

00:28:04,739 --> 00:28:08,039
that same page about what the current

00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:10,499
reality is and that aligns us and

00:28:08,039 --> 00:28:12,090
enables us to adapt another

00:28:10,499 --> 00:28:16,019
controversial figure here for a second

00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:17,759
Mike Tyson right so as he's famously

00:28:16,019 --> 00:28:20,970
said everyone has a plan until they get

00:28:17,759 --> 00:28:23,309
punched in the mouth and as our plan is

00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:26,099
dancing around the ring that first punch

00:28:23,309 --> 00:28:28,649
of reality can break our plan right

00:28:26,099 --> 00:28:31,139
those fists of reality essentially

00:28:28,649 --> 00:28:33,330
deliver that new awareness and now what

00:28:31,139 --> 00:28:35,129
do we do right and if that punch comes

00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:39,179
from Mike Tyson that's going to really

00:28:35,129 --> 00:28:41,909
hurt and I did spend quite some time

00:28:39,179 --> 00:28:43,859
trying to find figures who are not so

00:28:41,909 --> 00:28:46,889
controversial as Roosevelt and Mike

00:28:43,859 --> 00:28:49,889
Tyson so because something I'll continue

00:28:46,889 --> 00:28:51,359
exploring but the major difference here

00:28:49,889 --> 00:28:52,919
is we're not committing to a plan right

00:28:51,359 --> 00:28:54,479
as we get punched in the face do we get

00:28:52,919 --> 00:28:56,580
back up and keep trying that same plan

00:28:54,479 --> 00:28:59,789
or do we adapt right we're committing

00:28:56,580 --> 00:29:01,830
and this and this idea here is we're not

00:28:59,789 --> 00:29:04,259
committing to the whole plan right we're

00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:05,519
committing to focus on the current

00:29:04,259 --> 00:29:07,019
iteration we're committing to do the

00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:09,899
best that we can or committing to be

00:29:07,019 --> 00:29:11,099
adaptable right and the ways that we can

00:29:09,899 --> 00:29:14,369
do that the ways that we can gain

00:29:11,099 --> 00:29:18,149
awareness in the scrum like model or in

00:29:14,369 --> 00:29:21,179
any really agile framework is during a

00:29:18,149 --> 00:29:22,710
release so as I say great opportunities

00:29:21,179 --> 00:29:24,210
for awareness we focus on these

00:29:22,710 --> 00:29:25,170
shippable increments once every two

00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:26,820
weeks this

00:29:25,170 --> 00:29:28,770
to be an example of a project that had

00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:30,330
design right it may just be

00:29:28,770 --> 00:29:33,470
implementation and testing and

00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:36,270
specification but as a general example

00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:37,710
right and I think what makes that

00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:40,200
clearer and I don't know if that's

00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:42,120
possible to read but on the left is

00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:43,890
frequent release events in agile

00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:45,210
methodology and on the right you have

00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:48,180
your traditional waterfall methodology

00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:49,860
where you're building up the partner

00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:51,630
kind of goes away comes back three

00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:54,300
months later and deliver something

00:29:51,630 --> 00:30:00,690
that's incredibly high fidelity and it's

00:29:54,300 --> 00:30:02,580
totally wrong so these releases which we

00:30:00,690 --> 00:30:04,740
do every two weeks are critical moments

00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:08,610
for us to gain awareness to get that

00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:10,470
feedback that we need and then adapt and

00:30:08,610 --> 00:30:12,570
I think this comes from big releases

00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:15,240
being a thing of waterfall right where

00:30:12,570 --> 00:30:17,790
you write this really solid plan or you

00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:20,070
have your big design up front you've

00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:21,630
gotten everyone aligned to the plan it's

00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:24,330
very linear everything is super high

00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:26,190
fidelity every deliverable can take

00:30:24,330 --> 00:30:29,040
between five and eight months it's the

00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:31,740
final version of course and when you get

00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:33,660
the CEO signature you then throw it on

00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:36,960
the server and you don't look at it

00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:38,880
again until the plan contradicts reality

00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:40,650
right and there's probably some language

00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:42,720
in here about change orders and how to

00:30:40,650 --> 00:30:45,000
manage that which they obviously just

00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:48,560
compounds and leads to you know increase

00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:50,700
noise so you know you're on the left

00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:52,170
here your clients on the left and your

00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:53,790
team is on the right you're not

00:30:52,170 --> 00:30:55,320
communicating you've probably been doing

00:30:53,790 --> 00:30:57,390
your weekly statuses for the past six

00:30:55,320 --> 00:31:00,540
months and now things you know the

00:30:57,390 --> 00:31:02,340
development team did its best and it

00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:03,450
just continued you know do your

00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:04,980
development team couldn't see through

00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:09,180
walls this was an incredibly difficult

00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:11,430
project and now it's late right so how

00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:12,990
do we get here you know there's this

00:31:11,430 --> 00:31:14,520
there's this line item from you know

00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:16,800
probably one of my favorite line items

00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:18,480
from a proposal that someone sent us was

00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:20,880
you know buried in between things like

00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:22,380
must have a header and must be able to

00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:23,670
upload images there's this one

00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:24,870
requirement where you have

00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:27,720
state-of-the-art human-computer

00:31:24,870 --> 00:31:29,190
interaction and you probably read it in

00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:31,410
the same context as you did all those

00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:32,790
other items oh yeah right images every

00:31:31,410 --> 00:31:34,290
website as images every whoops there's a

00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:35,430
header say they're human computer

00:31:34,290 --> 00:31:37,470
interaction I don't really know what

00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:38,790
that means but it's okay we'll just keep

00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:40,650
moving forward

00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:44,220
six months later you're on the couch and

00:31:40,650 --> 00:31:45,960
you're like oh my god I delivered

00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:47,520
everything there's a header and it could

00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:49,620
upload images but now I'm going to spend

00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:51,090
the next six months making this thing be

00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:54,150
state-of-the-art with human computer

00:31:51,090 --> 00:31:56,220
interaction and at that when we do when

00:31:54,150 --> 00:31:58,140
that happens the project manager or

00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:59,250
whoever is in this role kind of the

00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:01,260
bullying it tries to shift the blame

00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:02,430
over to the client hey look you didn't

00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:03,360
tell us what you meant by

00:32:02,430 --> 00:32:05,160
state-of-the-art human-computer

00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:06,360
interaction right and I think really

00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:08,070
it's a reflection of the fact that we

00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:10,730
weren't communicating and I think it's

00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:13,230
on us to ask okay what does this mean

00:32:10,730 --> 00:32:15,690
and I think one of my favorite things

00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:18,480
about asking this question is this idea

00:32:15,690 --> 00:32:20,670
of doing less work so when we find

00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:22,530
ourselves making decisions on behalf of

00:32:20,670 --> 00:32:25,020
other people that are not in our

00:32:22,530 --> 00:32:26,400
organization we may find ourselves okay

00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:28,230
so the state of the art human-computer

00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:30,750
interaction I need to spend eight months

00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:32,280
and I'm going to do really high fidelity

00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:33,420
comps and I don't even know what it

00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:34,800
means stay to the army computer

00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:37,860
interaction as I think about it to come

00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:39,750
up with an example here and then you're

00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:41,190
like okay I'm here to deliver on this

00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:43,470
line item from the statement of work and

00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:45,680
you're just totally off right that's not

00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:48,570
at all what we were here to talk about

00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:49,890
or you may ask and like oh yeah I don't

00:32:48,570 --> 00:32:51,390
know someone put that in there but you

00:32:49,890 --> 00:32:54,150
can delete it and then you don't find

00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:56,610
yourself on a sofa a great way to think

00:32:54,150 --> 00:32:58,260
about this when I was at a conference

00:32:56,610 --> 00:32:59,730
someone said it's like washing your car

00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:01,380
right when you wake up in the morning

00:32:59,730 --> 00:33:03,690
and you go and look at your car and it's

00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:05,820
all dirty like oh you know what today

00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:07,020
I'm going to get up brush my teeth get

00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:08,580
some coffee wash my car and you go

00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:10,500
outside and you spent four hours waxing

00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:11,820
it and the thing is flawless and then

00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:14,070
you come back inside you sit down you're

00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:16,200
exhausted and starts to rain you're like

00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:18,300
okay I just wasted the past four hours

00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:20,280
of my life right so when you went

00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:21,510
outside to wash your car did you have

00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:23,040
the awareness that it was going to rain

00:33:21,510 --> 00:33:24,870
and then you decided to wash your car

00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:27,180
anyway did you have an opportunity for

00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:28,920
awareness to communicate with the

00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:30,120
weather channel may be like oh it's

00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:33,000
going to rain I will wash my car

00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:34,680
tomorrow right so you had an opportunity

00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:37,770
there to not spend the four hours doing

00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:39,270
that but you did it another thing that

00:33:37,770 --> 00:33:40,980
I've started doing is watching old TV

00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:44,010
shows not sure if anyone here is

00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:48,030
familiar with I Love Lucy great great

00:33:44,010 --> 00:33:50,580
show Lucy and Ethel are here and their

00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:52,780
husbands great characters this is a

00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:54,760
scene where Lucy and Ethel go back to

00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:56,140
work right they've they've been at home

00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:57,730
for a while time to go back to work

00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:59,890
trying to make time to make some money

00:33:57,730 --> 00:34:02,440
and they take a job at a chocolate

00:33:59,890 --> 00:34:04,930
factory and can tie a lot of parallels

00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:06,940
here to to software development right so

00:34:04,930 --> 00:34:09,190
they get comfortable with their plan of

00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:10,630
the chocolate factory which led to some

00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:14,140
overconfidence there were no feedback

00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:15,550
loops right and then after you know six

00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:16,659
hours in the job their bosses like wow

00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:18,790
you're doing great i want to give you

00:34:16,659 --> 00:34:20,470
more work to do right since you've been

00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:22,300
just doing these packaging these

00:34:20,470 --> 00:34:23,950
chocolates so well i'm going to turn up

00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:26,110
the conveyor belt right and then the

00:34:23,950 --> 00:34:27,550
boss goes away for another six hours it

00:34:26,110 --> 00:34:29,169
doesn't check in on them and then the

00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:31,659
chocolate comes starts coming out like

00:34:29,169 --> 00:34:34,150
crazy falling all over the place they're

00:34:31,659 --> 00:34:35,440
trying to hide the fact that they can't

00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:37,750
get everything done by stuffing it in

00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:39,820
their pockets they lack confidence to be

00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:42,070
open to say hey look help help and

00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:47,679
communicate about how they were over

00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:49,570
committed and we talk about you know so

00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:51,760
we're communicating we have an awareness

00:34:49,570 --> 00:34:53,650
right but we can't just be communicating

00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:56,110
and have an awareness forever right we

00:34:53,650 --> 00:34:57,940
need to be working on something so how

00:34:56,110 --> 00:35:00,820
we've done how we have approached that

00:34:57,940 --> 00:35:02,500
is by establishing a project vision so

00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:04,000
this is something that we use to gain

00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:05,500
alignment throughout the course of a

00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,820
project kind of what are the high-level

00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:08,770
ideas here that we're trying to achieve

00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:10,330
and when it means when this thing is

00:35:08,770 --> 00:35:11,860
done that will mean that we've delivered

00:35:10,330 --> 00:35:15,880
something of significant value to your

00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:17,230
organization and so it's really what

00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:19,270
we're doing this is an example of it

00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:20,620
that we wrote for a pretty large museum

00:35:19,270 --> 00:35:22,600
on the west coast of the United States

00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:24,430
it's what we're doing who are we doing

00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:27,640
it for and most importantly why are we

00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:29,080
doing it you know it doesn't say that

00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:30,940
we're going to build the world's most

00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:33,340
amazing Drupal site and we're going to

00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:35,110
leverage organic groups and media and

00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:36,640
all your content authors are going to

00:35:35,110 --> 00:35:39,640
love it right it's it's the ultimate

00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:41,340
business objective and we got here

00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:44,680
through a series of communication

00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:46,600
through a series of conversations right

00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:48,220
we we get in the room we like to ask

00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:50,830
people what their hopes and fears are

00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:52,480
right so get get all the project

00:35:50,830 --> 00:35:53,920
stakeholders including people who are

00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:55,840
not necessarily a stakeholder but are

00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:58,510
going to be involved in a project at a

00:35:55,840 --> 00:36:00,040
later date like marketing perhaps may

00:35:58,510 --> 00:36:01,630
have someone from communications join

00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:03,340
that person would ultimately be

00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:05,590
responsible for training new site users

00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:06,400
that person may be like hey look this

00:36:05,590 --> 00:36:07,839
current

00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:09,460
from that we're using is impossible to

00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:11,200
train people on no one can ever figure

00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:13,750
out how to use it we'll need to note

00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:16,650
that right usability is a big concern an

00:36:13,750 --> 00:36:21,039
easy one to two at least recognize

00:36:16,650 --> 00:36:22,240
difficult often to implement and but

00:36:21,039 --> 00:36:24,039
more importantly right we want to make

00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:25,779
sure i t who is often left out of

00:36:24,039 --> 00:36:28,029
initial conversations has a chance to

00:36:25,779 --> 00:36:30,130
say something like okay we we have this

00:36:28,029 --> 00:36:31,660
pretty critical integration so i'd like

00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:34,029
to make sure that you're aware of this

00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:35,799
so that 11 months from now when you're

00:36:34,029 --> 00:36:37,630
ready to flick the switch and change

00:36:35,799 --> 00:36:41,260
that a record we can be like we don't

00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:43,720
have to randomly scramble and like i

00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:46,359
said talk about that unique integration

00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:47,740
we were looking for things constantly on

00:36:46,359 --> 00:36:49,809
the lookout for anything that is unique

00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:52,180
and unusual right we want to catch these

00:36:49,809 --> 00:36:53,349
things any sort of project inputs that

00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:56,079
will need to be considered at a later

00:36:53,349 --> 00:36:58,720
date so if anyone's kind of in this room

00:36:56,079 --> 00:37:00,430
has ever participated in any sort of

00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:01,720
high-level brainstorming exercise like

00:37:00,430 --> 00:37:03,609
that you may have found yourself and

00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:06,099
what is often referred to as the grounds

00:37:03,609 --> 00:37:08,770
own this is when you're brainstorming so

00:37:06,099 --> 00:37:11,079
many ideas you diverge from a one idea

00:37:08,770 --> 00:37:13,390
several other ideas emerge and then it's

00:37:11,079 --> 00:37:16,150
almost impossible to converge on an

00:37:13,390 --> 00:37:19,119
actual list of ideas and then also in a

00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:20,980
prioritized list so really it's a series

00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:24,010
of brainstorming exercises techniques

00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:26,640
politics gets involved it can be

00:37:24,010 --> 00:37:30,039
incredibly challenging to navigate and

00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:35,079
that kind of helps us with goals and

00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:36,880
direction so and we can also so when we

00:37:35,079 --> 00:37:39,789
translate that vision into integrals and

00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:42,670
direction we're really breaking down the

00:37:39,789 --> 00:37:44,200
project into meaningful chunks that we

00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:46,809
can then check out on a regular basis

00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:48,789
one of the biggest criticisms I've heard

00:37:46,809 --> 00:37:50,770
of an agile process is that you really

00:37:48,789 --> 00:37:52,750
lose sight of the vision when you're six

00:37:50,770 --> 00:37:53,920
or eight months down the road kind of

00:37:52,750 --> 00:37:55,990
what you thought that you were going to

00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:57,819
start in the very beginning is no longer

00:37:55,990 --> 00:37:58,960
kind of where you are and one of the

00:37:57,819 --> 00:38:01,210
things I found to be incredibly helpful

00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:03,099
there is putting together a bill doc

00:38:01,210 --> 00:38:04,529
that essentially has what our goals and

00:38:03,099 --> 00:38:10,150
directions are and how we're going to

00:38:04,529 --> 00:38:13,480
schedule those kind of roughly so that

00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:15,700
helps inform what we use as a push start

00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:18,490
so when you're starting a new project

00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:20,260
right a lot of times the tenancy there

00:38:18,490 --> 00:38:22,090
may be to do like six months of

00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:23,890
inning right we want to get in there and

00:38:22,090 --> 00:38:25,660
we want a prototype as quickly as

00:38:23,890 --> 00:38:27,550
possible we want to whether or not

00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:30,130
that's Drupal and often the case it's

00:38:27,550 --> 00:38:32,080
not it may just be a low fidelity sketch

00:38:30,130 --> 00:38:34,450
we want to start translating these words

00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:38,800
in the actual things that we can put in

00:38:34,450 --> 00:38:41,050
front of people and get feedback on and

00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:42,700
then so we're communicating awareness

00:38:41,050 --> 00:38:43,930
have that vision you know how

00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:45,520
challenging is the problem that we're

00:38:43,930 --> 00:38:47,890
trying to solve right how much

00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:50,410
communication is necessary so

00:38:47,890 --> 00:38:53,080
academically speaking you know I haven't

00:38:50,410 --> 00:38:54,490
really touched on things like scrum XP

00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:56,650
and all the other agile methodologies

00:38:54,490 --> 00:38:58,620
that fall underneath that umbrella but

00:38:56,650 --> 00:39:01,180
this is where you would consider hey

00:38:58,620 --> 00:39:03,520
what approach does make sense here right

00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:05,410
how complicated how complex is this

00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:07,900
problem and how much communication is

00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:09,430
necessary so depending on you know the

00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:11,440
blue dot being the problem that you're

00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:15,180
trying to solve depending on where that

00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:19,510
falls kind of informs the recommended

00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:22,030
management approach so on the x axis we

00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:23,830
have certainty right where you know

00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:26,110
something being on the bottom left is

00:39:23,830 --> 00:39:27,550
where it's absolutely certain right you

00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:30,400
have a small team that's probably done

00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:32,890
this a hundred times before they've

00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:35,050
worked together for years they know how

00:39:32,890 --> 00:39:38,440
to do this thing it's we're certain that

00:39:35,050 --> 00:39:40,810
this is how you solve this problem right

00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:42,370
and then the y-axis is how well in

00:39:40,810 --> 00:39:44,440
agreement are your requirements and how

00:39:42,370 --> 00:39:46,690
well in agreement are your stakeholders

00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:48,100
right is management all over the place

00:39:46,690 --> 00:39:52,990
does everyone in the room want different

00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:54,190
things so simple being at the bottom

00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:55,870
left right where you'd find your

00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:58,120
traditional waterfall methodology is

00:39:55,870 --> 00:39:59,380
where we have a perfect understanding of

00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:01,150
all the things that we need to know and

00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:03,310
we have a we have complete visibility

00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:08,560
into what it means to be done 11 months

00:40:03,310 --> 00:40:10,270
from now right so I think very few large

00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:12,820
projects ever find themselves in that

00:40:10,270 --> 00:40:15,430
situation maybe like a quick one week

00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:18,250
project but for the most part the larger

00:40:15,430 --> 00:40:20,530
engagements end up in the zone of

00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:23,560
complexity which is that white space

00:40:20,530 --> 00:40:24,850
between complicated and anarchy and

00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:25,900
that's kind of where the requirements

00:40:24,850 --> 00:40:27,640
aren't exactly one hundred percent

00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:28,660
understood and how we're going to do it

00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:31,690
isn't exactly one hundred percent

00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:33,430
understood but we're going to work

00:40:31,690 --> 00:40:33,880
together take incremental steps moving

00:40:33,430 --> 00:40:35,950
for

00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:41,290
word scrum is a great framework to use

00:40:35,950 --> 00:40:43,510
here and then as a last example when you

00:40:41,290 --> 00:40:46,030
find yourself in Anarchy right because

00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:47,770
when you have 40 people working on the

00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:51,190
same project and 30 of them are

00:40:47,770 --> 00:40:52,960
stakeholders and 15 of them are critical

00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:54,970
decision makers and you're in that

00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:58,030
anarchy situation and then you try to

00:40:54,970 --> 00:40:59,980
force it into a simple process like

00:40:58,030 --> 00:41:03,460
waterfall that is another opportunity

00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:06,070
for chaos that is where things begin to

00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:08,290
quickly fall apart so a lesson that I

00:41:06,070 --> 00:41:13,630
learned here is to work really hard to

00:41:08,290 --> 00:41:15,550
not force simplicity so communicating

00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:17,290
about a shared awareness we've developed

00:41:15,550 --> 00:41:19,690
that vision we're talking about that

00:41:17,290 --> 00:41:22,350
vision we're adapting on our goals and

00:41:19,690 --> 00:41:25,690
direction and we're shipping something

00:41:22,350 --> 00:41:27,670
and a few weeks ago or maybe now a

00:41:25,690 --> 00:41:30,130
couple months ago I was reading an

00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:31,480
article and there was this quote right

00:41:30,130 --> 00:41:34,360
it's not the strongest of the species

00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:36,160
that survive not the most intelligent

00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:37,840
but the one most responsive to change

00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:40,630
and I don't know if anyone here

00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:42,910
remembers 7th grade biology or I don't

00:41:40,630 --> 00:41:48,630
know what it would have been does anyone

00:41:42,910 --> 00:41:51,250
obviously know who this is not you

00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:53,910
anyway it's Darwin thought that was

00:41:51,250 --> 00:41:56,920
pretty cool incredibly validating

00:41:53,910 --> 00:41:59,560
already so I hope that you will join us

00:41:56,920 --> 00:42:01,840
later for a contribution sprints Rob

00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:03,370
here is works with me at last call and

00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:05,290
he spent probably the good 20 minutes of

00:42:03,370 --> 00:42:07,330
this presentation contributing back that

00:42:05,290 --> 00:42:08,530
stuff is really important to us since

00:42:07,330 --> 00:42:09,850
we've been involved in a Drupal project

00:42:08,530 --> 00:42:11,500
for a really long time it's a great

00:42:09,850 --> 00:42:17,220
opportunity to give back to know people

00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:17,220
and will definitely be there Thanks

00:42:23,310 --> 00:42:26,310
absolutely

00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:40,930
hi hi I'm I'm from a similar sized

00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:43,030
company as you from Germany and I want

00:42:40,930 --> 00:42:47,530
to ask how do you deal with how do you

00:42:43,030 --> 00:42:49,390
plan support great so we have an ongoing

00:42:47,530 --> 00:42:51,550
support team we call it the continuous

00:42:49,390 --> 00:42:53,650
delivery team at last call so that is

00:42:51,550 --> 00:42:55,600
difficult because one of the reasons why

00:42:53,650 --> 00:42:58,000
one of the things that you need for a

00:42:55,600 --> 00:43:01,300
scrum methodology right is a backlog and

00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:03,340
support you may have a backlog of tasks

00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:06,190
but you're constantly interrupted by new

00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:07,900
higher priority tasks so Rob actually

00:43:06,190 --> 00:43:10,180
leads that that team back at the office

00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:12,280
and what they do is they have a daily

00:43:10,180 --> 00:43:14,200
standup where they review more conv on

00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:15,910
style where they review all the

00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:17,470
outstanding support tasks prioritize

00:43:15,910 --> 00:43:21,430
those support tasks and has become the

00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:22,990
tasks of the day it's the teams because

00:43:21,430 --> 00:43:28,210
nobody wants to be on a support team

00:43:22,990 --> 00:43:30,070
right so it's a one of the I could go on

00:43:28,210 --> 00:43:30,880
for this couple of minutes but one of

00:43:30,070 --> 00:43:32,410
the things that's been really rewarding

00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:34,210
about the support team is it's a great

00:43:32,410 --> 00:43:36,100
place for people to learn and touch a

00:43:34,210 --> 00:43:38,500
lot of different technologies so we

00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:39,970
don't know it's it's also really about

00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:42,400
how we talk about things right if we

00:43:39,970 --> 00:43:43,510
were like oh support no one likes to

00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:45,070
support anything just give me all the

00:43:43,510 --> 00:43:46,390
shiny new Drupal projects right that's

00:43:45,070 --> 00:43:48,100
how we're communicating about things

00:43:46,390 --> 00:43:49,840
internally then of course no one's going

00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:51,430
to want to get anywhere near it but

00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:53,080
we've we've really positioned it as an

00:43:51,430 --> 00:43:54,850
exciting opportunity and i truly do

00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:56,770
believe that it support can be really

00:43:54,850 --> 00:43:59,230
amazing and helpful for you know

00:43:56,770 --> 00:44:01,060
potentially new developers or new people

00:43:59,230 --> 00:44:06,460
to the project you want to kind of gain

00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:10,000
that skill and expertise think there's

00:44:06,460 --> 00:44:11,860
this guy but okay hi i was wondering if

00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,930
you i guess if you had any suggestions

00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:15,040
or what your thoughts are on making sure

00:44:13,930 --> 00:44:16,810
that you're meeting specific

00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:18,310
requirements and deadlines like if

00:44:16,810 --> 00:44:20,200
you're working from a request for

00:44:18,310 --> 00:44:22,060
proposals with the financial method

00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:23,620
because it seems so much easier to do

00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:25,240
with waterfall you kind of know when

00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:26,500
those things are going to be hit so when

00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:27,700
you are working agile how do you make

00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:29,170
sure that you're hitting all the

00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:31,660
requirements and still getting the

00:44:29,170 --> 00:44:33,490
project out on time and fostering that

00:44:31,660 --> 00:44:36,640
creativity and ability to sort of change

00:44:33,490 --> 00:44:37,840
the project as it goes yeah so one of

00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:39,430
the things that we do there is we

00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:40,830
immediately start to end I'm not sure it

00:44:39,430 --> 00:44:43,300
just answers your question completely

00:44:40,830 --> 00:44:45,070
because I kind of think it starts to

00:44:43,300 --> 00:44:47,500
touch on things like budget right how do

00:44:45,070 --> 00:44:49,330
you how do you develop something how do

00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:50,680
you sky is really the limit in the

00:44:49,330 --> 00:44:51,670
creative process and how do you turn

00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:54,490
that into something that you ultimately

00:44:51,670 --> 00:44:56,680
deliver and as an agency you don't you

00:44:54,490 --> 00:44:59,050
know you're actually being responsible

00:44:56,680 --> 00:45:01,600
and not leading to significant overruns

00:44:59,050 --> 00:45:03,760
so what we'll do one of the first things

00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:06,400
that will do and if we get asked to

00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:09,460
respond to an RFP and it were the

00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:12,220
successful bidder is will break that

00:45:09,460 --> 00:45:15,610
down into like really solid definitions

00:45:12,220 --> 00:45:17,020
have done in in a backlog so and what

00:45:15,610 --> 00:45:18,430
we'll do is we'll talk about kind of

00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:21,550
each one individually and it's a

00:45:18,430 --> 00:45:23,440
constant negotiation and it's a constant

00:45:21,550 --> 00:45:25,390
opportunity to like share the awareness

00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:28,150
of the those forces that we've been

00:45:25,390 --> 00:45:30,940
talking about so kind of really like a

00:45:28,150 --> 00:45:32,380
high level answer but yeah and then

00:45:30,940 --> 00:45:33,910
there's that that reality at the end of

00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:36,130
the day right where you've significantly

00:45:33,910 --> 00:45:37,720
underbid a fixed bid project and and

00:45:36,130 --> 00:45:41,050
you're locked in so we've definitely

00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:42,850
been there and and we found that an

00:45:41,050 --> 00:45:46,240
agile process where we're constantly

00:45:42,850 --> 00:45:48,720
able to inspect adapt negotiate has led

00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:51,070
to far significant overruns but overruns

00:45:48,720 --> 00:46:05,740
unfortunately do exist from time to time

00:45:51,070 --> 00:46:08,290
okay thanks hey hi india ng-show does

00:46:05,740 --> 00:46:11,380
this diagram with stacy's diagram this

00:46:08,290 --> 00:46:13,420
diagram it ok you told us when when you

00:46:11,380 --> 00:46:16,000
reach when your problem reaches the the

00:46:13,420 --> 00:46:20,100
enter key year yeah so work really hard

00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:25,540
not to go to make it a simple problem

00:46:20,100 --> 00:46:27,970
but why not and what do you do when your

00:46:25,540 --> 00:46:29,830
problem face is energy yeah I think on

00:46:27,970 --> 00:46:31,780
larger projects sometimes you start in

00:46:29,830 --> 00:46:33,910
anarchy right you don't really know what

00:46:31,780 --> 00:46:35,920
you're doing there's no authority you

00:46:33,910 --> 00:46:37,720
just kind of have to get started and

00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:40,840
there's like you know maybe there are 30

00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:42,630
people involved so yeah it's it's a maze

00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:44,470
where things are constantly changing

00:46:42,630 --> 00:46:47,020
stakeholders are not involved in the

00:46:44,470 --> 00:46:49,330
beginning may be you know 30 minutes or

00:46:47,020 --> 00:46:52,060
three weeks or three months late to the

00:46:49,330 --> 00:46:54,520
conversation so I think really the only

00:46:52,060 --> 00:46:56,400
way to navigate out of anarchy and into

00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:57,809
the zone of complexity where

00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:59,339
we really need to be comfortable in the

00:46:57,809 --> 00:47:01,950
software development industry in that

00:46:59,339 --> 00:47:03,390
space is by frequently communicating

00:47:01,950 --> 00:47:05,309
frequently documenting frequently

00:47:03,390 --> 00:47:07,529
sharing our awareness and sort of

00:47:05,309 --> 00:47:10,049
helping by delivering things will take

00:47:07,529 --> 00:47:13,319
shape and will slowly start to navigate

00:47:10,049 --> 00:47:14,880
out of there but there is there's this

00:47:13,319 --> 00:47:16,380
soft as this chart that I didn't include

00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:18,630
it's the software development lifecycle

00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:19,799
and things kind of get you know you

00:47:18,630 --> 00:47:21,720
start off a project there's a lot of

00:47:19,799 --> 00:47:23,490
hope and then things slowly start to dip

00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:25,380
and then you end up in doubt and then

00:47:23,490 --> 00:47:29,339
there's recovery and now you're taking a

00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:30,450
photo of this graph I don't know and

00:47:29,339 --> 00:47:31,829
then you'd and then you'd deliver right

00:47:30,450 --> 00:47:34,200
and at the same time you're going from

00:47:31,829 --> 00:47:36,599
optimism to pessimism and moods change

00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:38,309
so it's all about getting out of that

00:47:36,599 --> 00:47:44,730
area out of that groans own out of

00:47:38,309 --> 00:47:46,589
anarchy as quickly as possible yeah so I

00:47:44,730 --> 00:47:48,029
think when you take a simple approach

00:47:46,589 --> 00:47:49,710
like a waterfall methodology where you

00:47:48,029 --> 00:47:52,319
force people to write all the things

00:47:49,710 --> 00:47:54,260
down and then not allow them to change I

00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:57,809
think that is when you find yourself

00:47:54,260 --> 00:48:03,270
heading towards chaos because things do

00:47:57,809 --> 00:48:06,329
change yeah cool I think that's it one

00:48:03,270 --> 00:48:08,279
more what tools do you use to actually

00:48:06,329 --> 00:48:09,990
do the planning and shared cheer all the

00:48:08,279 --> 00:48:13,039
different tasks and deadlines great

00:48:09,990 --> 00:48:15,930
great question so it's going to sound

00:48:13,039 --> 00:48:18,059
pretty medieval right but a lot of this

00:48:15,930 --> 00:48:21,390
stuff starts in a google doc I'm a huge

00:48:18,059 --> 00:48:23,069
fan over letting the tool support the

00:48:21,390 --> 00:48:26,160
process and if we're just brainstorming

00:48:23,069 --> 00:48:30,089
or throwing ideas together we'll start

00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:31,799
in a Google Doc I also will if I'm on

00:48:30,089 --> 00:48:33,319
site and we're fleshing out an idea i'll

00:48:31,799 --> 00:48:37,049
just get up and do it on the whiteboard

00:48:33,319 --> 00:48:39,119
i've also been known to open up a Google

00:48:37,049 --> 00:48:40,589
presentation and just build a quick you

00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:42,390
know like we've been wireframing on

00:48:40,589 --> 00:48:44,039
something for days and it doesn't seem

00:48:42,390 --> 00:48:46,559
like we're getting anywhere but if we

00:48:44,039 --> 00:48:49,500
can just on the spot figure something

00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:51,809
out we'll do that in terms of tools that

00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:54,869
we have back at the office we use read

00:48:51,809 --> 00:49:01,839
mine is a really great tool open source

00:48:54,869 --> 00:49:03,900
to cool already I think that's it

00:49:01,839 --> 00:49:03,900
