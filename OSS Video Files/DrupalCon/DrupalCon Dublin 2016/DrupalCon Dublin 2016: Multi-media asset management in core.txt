Title: DrupalCon Dublin 2016: Multi-media asset management in core
Publication date: 2016-09-27
Playlist: DrupalCon Dublin 2016
Description: 
	Media seems to be one of the hottest topics in the Drupal world at the moment. But what is "media"? From the past experience we concluded, that there are many different views on that. However, it seems that most of people include multi-media asset management from the perspective of the content creator when referring to it. This core conversation will focus on this part of "media".

We will check what we already have in core and what is happening in contrib space. Based on that we will explore what the possible paths forward from the core perspective are. Which contrib solutions are good candidates to be included? What is the realistic timeline for that?

The ultimate goal of this conversation is to create a general plan for the core part of the Media initiative.

hi everyone welcome to this session a

00:00:05,089 --> 00:00:16,529
core conversation about multimedia asset

00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:18,690
management in for this is supposed to be

00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:22,560
a conversation which means that should

00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:25,109
be bi-directional and I would ask you if

00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:28,650
you have questions or comments to go to

00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:31,710
that Mike and speak there because they

00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:33,239
are recording this and to be able to

00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:35,219
people that will be watching your dis

00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:43,920
recording to be able to hear you we need

00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:45,950
to do that my name is yanes I am senior

00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,719
engineer and team leader them systems

00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:53,250
I've been active member of the Drupal

00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:56,430
community since 2009 I say active

00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:58,770
because i've been using drupal even a

00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:03,840
bit earlier than that but God actively

00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:06,810
involved a bit later and if I would have

00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:10,740
to do it again I would become active at

00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:13,680
the beginning I'm one of the leads of d8

00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:16,710
media initiative it's the initiative

00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:21,420
that has been focusing on improving

00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:24,090
media and contribute late now we started

00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:28,619
some discussions about which parts could

00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:31,290
be moved in core and how and why and I

00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:34,439
used to work for examiner.com which used

00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:37,140
to be a huge media site it was one of

00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:39,119
the first group of seven websites it was

00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:42,299
the biggest in terms of traffic for a

00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:46,110
long time and this is basically where my

00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:50,250
interest in media again and I was also

00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:52,680
able to to work in this area because I

00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:57,840
was working there unfortunately site is

00:01:52,680 --> 00:02:00,899
not online anymore it died this July but

00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:03,869
it gave a lot of things to me and the

00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:06,390
Drupal community I didn't have any

00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:08,970
recent enough photo with my new look so

00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:10,610
and Drupal is about a community and

00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:15,050
these are my drupal friends so I

00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:18,110
to use this forum as I said I work for a

00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:21,530
company called and assistance is a Swiss

00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:25,030
webshop from Zurich our CTO is Sasha

00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:28,970
he's one of the top five d8 contributors

00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:34,520
we are v8 experts we've been working

00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:36,950
with d8 four years now basically rowing

00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:39,170
out the eight websites for how much time

00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:46,670
Sasha more than a year I guess it's fair

00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:49,390
to say a lot of media sites we are one

00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:52,040
of the partners involved with mph

00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:57,560
distribution this is a v8 distribution

00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:59,690
for enterprise media websites and we

00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:03,200
tried to give back twenty percent of

00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:05,510
every project to the community that's

00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:09,320
why you also probably heard that we are

00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:12,410
one of the biggest contributors to the

00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:14,630
community and especially if you consider

00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:20,570
the size of the company because we are

00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:25,459
quite small so what are we going to talk

00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:28,400
about today i will briefly explain what

00:03:25,459 --> 00:03:31,610
we seem is what our users want from

00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:33,260
media in drupal we will see what we

00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:36,049
currently have in core we will see what

00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:39,920
we currently have even trip and then i

00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:43,370
will explain my proposal for

00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:45,380
improvements in core and how to achieve

00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:48,019
that and then we should have

00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:53,630
conversation about it i'm hoping to hear

00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:55,549
a lot of ideas from youtube so this

00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:58,010
whole journey basic for me basically

00:03:55,549 --> 00:04:01,269
started three years ago at rubicon

00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:06,410
Prague or I had the core conversation

00:04:01,269 --> 00:04:09,890
about media in Drupal 8 which sounds

00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:12,250
very similar to this one but it was much

00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:18,320
more early stage than it is now and

00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:21,859
before that conversation I I did a

00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:24,020
survey and asked people what they expect

00:04:21,859 --> 00:04:27,169
what they want what are the features the

00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:29,810
they most urgently need enjoyable

00:04:27,169 --> 00:04:32,330
related to media and these were the

00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:35,569
results like media library where you can

00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:40,009
browse all your media that these on your

00:04:35,569 --> 00:04:44,780
site and search through it that you are

00:04:40,009 --> 00:04:47,960
able to reuse your assets that you can

00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:51,909
use local assets like images and

00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:56,050
documents and that you can also

00:04:51,909 --> 00:04:58,849
equivalently use remote media so local

00:04:56,050 --> 00:05:00,889
in this terminology is something that

00:04:58,849 --> 00:05:02,960
you host in your web server so it's not

00:05:00,889 --> 00:05:05,080
actually local because it's not usually

00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:08,030
but hosted from your local computer

00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:10,789
while remote is something that is hosted

00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:14,169
by a third party usually like like a

00:05:10,789 --> 00:05:16,449
YouTube video or or a Flickr image or

00:05:14,169 --> 00:05:20,210
SlideShare slides or something like that

00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:22,250
it doesn't physically leave on on the

00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:25,039
servers where your group website lives

00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:28,280
but you probably want to use this

00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:29,630
content in context of your site which

00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:33,560
also means that you need to support

00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:36,069
editorial process around them then with

00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:39,259
the week embedding of media assets and

00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:42,139
cropping also came up there were few

00:05:39,259 --> 00:05:44,539
other things but this items were

00:05:42,139 --> 00:05:48,560
probably there was it's almost everybody

00:05:44,539 --> 00:05:52,430
in the survey mentioned and now three

00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:54,289
years three years later after talking to

00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:56,630
many people after many discussions in

00:05:54,289 --> 00:05:58,099
issue queues and events and so on it

00:05:56,630 --> 00:06:01,490
seems that these are still the most

00:05:58,099 --> 00:06:04,099
important like maybe priorities change a

00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:07,550
little bit but like if we solve this

00:06:04,099 --> 00:06:12,139
we've done quite good job for the

00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:16,699
beginning so what we having call right

00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:21,860
now we're able to host local images

00:06:16,699 --> 00:06:24,110
files documents we also added a multi

00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:26,960
upload in the eighth which wasn't there

00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:29,330
in d7 it's not entirely obvious you can

00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:31,639
basically select more files when you

00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:34,250
click on this browse button or you can

00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:37,670
drag and drop more files to this little

00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:40,910
element as I said it works it will

00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:44,330
them all of them at once and they will

00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:47,510
all appear in this table but it's not

00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:49,910
obvious it's not the usual like huge

00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:51,800
area where it says drought drag your

00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:57,380
files here to upload them or something

00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:59,180
like that so this improved a little bit

00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:04,180
but the user experience is probably not

00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:08,390
the best then we have this files listing

00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:09,890
like very very basic media library but I

00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:15,440
would argue that this is another media

00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:18,350
library and backstory of this listing is

00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:20,810
we were pretty late in v8 cycle or let

00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:23,900
already and we didn't improve much of

00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:26,150
media and we got using and we said

00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:28,580
we could at least build a view that

00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:31,610
lists all your files so you have this

00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:37,070
some kind of insight into that you're

00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:38,870
not don't agree and we build that view

00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:41,840
this was something that was possible at

00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:48,500
that time and we needed to use what

00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:51,200
views defied defined by default then we

00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:55,460
have embedding we can embed images into

00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:58,790
WYSIWYG in pure core itself it supports

00:07:55,460 --> 00:08:02,450
aligning and captions and it works very

00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:06,260
good so this is one of the probably best

00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:08,600
improvements for the eight but it's also

00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:14,410
it's also limited just to images you

00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:17,710
cannot embed a video for example and

00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:22,310
this is also one of the examples wear a

00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:24,740
corset standard and then contribs able

00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:27,980
to follow this standard which is very

00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:31,130
important because I believe if core

00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:35,770
creates standards for us and we don't

00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:39,920
have to invent this very low-level parts

00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:45,010
in contrib we are we end up with much

00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:47,810
cleaner and much less fragmented

00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:51,100
ecosystem because if contribs starts to

00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:53,259
inventing very low level stuff you you

00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:56,410
get different solutions start competing

00:08:53,259 --> 00:08:58,449
and then for site builders or end users

00:08:56,410 --> 00:09:01,120
is confusing because they don't know

00:08:58,449 --> 00:09:03,880
which solutions to take and which one is

00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:08,649
better and what that means in long term

00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:12,420
etc here basically course set the

00:09:08,649 --> 00:09:17,290
standard how this embedded thing is

00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:20,459
stored in that body field and we use

00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:23,500
this more or less the same approach in

00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:25,779
contraband this functionality to be able

00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:30,009
to embed much more than just images and

00:09:25,779 --> 00:09:33,699
it's kind of and because we use the same

00:09:30,009 --> 00:09:36,339
approach caption works in a similar way

00:09:33,699 --> 00:09:39,310
and the lining works in a similar way we

00:09:36,339 --> 00:09:42,910
are able to rely on core to do that so I

00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:45,220
think that this is very important then

00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:48,089
we have usage tracking it's something

00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:51,630
that when you do when we discuss media

00:09:48,089 --> 00:09:54,639
it's often completely forgotten about

00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:59,199
but the fact that we are tracking usage

00:09:54,639 --> 00:10:02,259
and I don't think that some of our

00:09:59,199 --> 00:10:04,810
competitors do that like I might be

00:10:02,259 --> 00:10:07,089
wrong as I am NOT following all the

00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:09,310
process in all areas but this is

00:10:07,089 --> 00:10:11,439
something that is hidden underneath the

00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:13,389
hood and it's very important for

00:10:11,439 --> 00:10:17,319
consistency of assistance you of your

00:10:13,389 --> 00:10:19,240
content and this has been in Drupal

00:10:17,319 --> 00:10:21,490
forever but I just wanted to say that

00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:23,949
there are things in core that are good

00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:29,759
and maybe we forget about them a lot of

00:10:23,949 --> 00:10:34,380
times so if we see which of the most

00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:37,180
important use cases we cover by core is

00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:41,079
uploading and using local media assets

00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:43,569
and WYSIWYG embedding I intentionally

00:10:41,079 --> 00:10:45,970
didn't cross the media library because

00:10:43,569 --> 00:10:48,730
as i said i don't see that listing is a

00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:56,170
media library but argue with me please

00:10:48,730 --> 00:11:01,779
if you want and of course there is a lot

00:10:56,170 --> 00:11:02,600
of work going on in contribs not

00:11:01,779 --> 00:11:04,630
actively

00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:09,019
and the first thing is support for

00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:13,850
remote media this is the media library

00:11:09,019 --> 00:11:19,009
from what is now becoming media module 4

00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:23,290
d8 it was a summer of code project by

00:11:19,009 --> 00:11:26,769
Vijay who is standing there at the back

00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:29,389
it was initially developed on github but

00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:32,350
just recently in the last days we pushed

00:11:29,389 --> 00:11:36,139
it to drupal org it's not finished yet

00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:40,399
but we have a dev release on Jupiter log

00:11:36,139 --> 00:11:43,339
so it's easier to find and yet in this

00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:46,069
library you can have local so-called

00:11:43,339 --> 00:11:51,019
local media which are the blue boxes and

00:11:46,069 --> 00:11:53,389
remote media which are the red boxes so

00:11:51,019 --> 00:12:00,589
we can support your multimedia angle

00:11:53,389 --> 00:12:01,940
trip then something that is very

00:12:00,589 --> 00:12:05,980
important when you start dealing with

00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:08,990
remote media is how you handle metadata

00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:12,110
usually let's take an example of a

00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:15,709
YouTube video on YouTube you don't have

00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:18,259
just the video you have title and tags

00:12:15,709 --> 00:12:21,170
and description and maybe thumbnails

00:12:18,259 --> 00:12:23,180
that YouTube can provide for you and in

00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:25,279
the past it was really really hard to

00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:27,170
use this information in Drupal in a

00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:30,079
standardized way of course it would like

00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:32,930
code the custom module that would

00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:35,870
connect you with YouTube and then you

00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:37,699
would be able to get this data but as

00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:41,540
far as I know there was no standardized

00:12:37,699 --> 00:12:43,850
way of connecting to many different

00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:47,120
services and exposing information that

00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:51,889
these services provide to your drupal

00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:55,459
site incontri we have this now we shoot

00:12:51,889 --> 00:12:57,949
through the plug-in system every every

00:12:55,459 --> 00:13:00,350
remote or even local media type can say

00:12:57,949 --> 00:13:04,009
these are the fields that I have

00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:06,560
available for you and this are the

00:13:04,009 --> 00:13:09,560
fields that the tweet plugin makes

00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:13,430
available for you and then you can

00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:16,230
access those fields in this data in a

00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:18,360
very standardized manner like it

00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:20,550
your developer experience is the same

00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:23,130
for every type that you are accessing

00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:26,520
and there is also ability for you to

00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:29,610
define mapping and when this item is

00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:32,040
saved fields will be automatically

00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:36,780
populated so in this case we save the

00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:39,120
twit we referenced it with the URL only

00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:42,150
and then on the save because of this

00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:44,100
mapping other fields were stored as part

00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:46,290
of your entity so you have access to the

00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:52,020
tweet author or tweet ID if you need it

00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:55,790
for any reason or retweet count so and

00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:59,730
it works the same way for every type

00:13:55,790 --> 00:14:02,750
then we have libraries first library

00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:08,550
that we saw is the one from media module

00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:12,540
and because core doesn't provide any any

00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:14,220
any guidance here we already have few

00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:17,520
different implementations of media

00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:20,820
library in core in country for d8 this

00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:26,030
is for example the file entity browser

00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:31,950
module which uses means masonry library

00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:35,250
to do this grid and it looks nice but if

00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:40,830
we go back it looks completely different

00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:43,890
than this one and this is the area where

00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:48,780
I think or could do a lot to standardize

00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:51,180
things and then like let's say we have a

00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:54,540
library in core that supports just

00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:57,960
images for example but sets visual

00:14:54,540 --> 00:15:01,560
standards then modules in can't rip that

00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:05,700
provides support for different asset

00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:08,600
types like videos or slides or whatever

00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:12,210
can follow that visual standard and

00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:14,060
represent their items in with the same

00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:17,310
look and feel if that makes sense and

00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:19,860
this way we would probably avoid the

00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:22,680
situation when we have another media

00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:25,920
library in control so this is from

00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:29,760
lightning distribution they are doing a

00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:30,180
lot of great job they're using all the

00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:33,060
modules

00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:35,550
the darlington trib and building on top

00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:39,779
of them providing some glue code so this

00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:42,060
is one of the best places if you want to

00:15:39,779 --> 00:15:44,279
see how things currently working what is

00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:46,560
possible to check with them have

00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:50,730
lightning underscore media module that

00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:53,700
brings all the pieces together and the

00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:58,680
friend of mine this kind of anecdote the

00:15:53,700 --> 00:16:03,089
friend of mine said once that one of the

00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:06,810
drupal media library solutions looked

00:16:03,089 --> 00:16:09,770
like drupal with that mask that the evil

00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:13,430
character from batman movie had well

00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:16,470
group of it that thing on the face and

00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:18,620
it's getting a little bit better but it

00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:30,839
still sometimes look a little bit

00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:43,410
non-standard then another thing that we

00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:46,350
have is sorry but this will disappear so

00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:48,900
we have ability to have this nice amount

00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:51,720
i upload and this is not the only thing

00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:53,880
that we have we can do like multi-step

00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:56,250
workflows in contract here we have the

00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:58,140
media library from a lengthy browser

00:16:56,250 --> 00:17:00,990
that we've seen earlier and we selected

00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:03,510
few images and those images appear here

00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:06,900
below like an intermediary selection and

00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:08,790
we can reorganize that and then if we

00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:12,620
are not happy just with with this assets

00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:16,319
here we can Apple upload a few more with

00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:19,530
using this multi uploads rob's on GS

00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:23,880
library and they appear again we can all

00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:26,640
reorder them again and then when we when

00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:32,100
we're happy with the selection we can we

00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:36,000
can tell Drupal to send it back to the

00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:37,740
file field which is a much nicer

00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:43,230
experience my opinion that what we have

00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:48,059
in quite handy then

00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:55,440
I showed you embedding for images in

00:17:48,059 --> 00:17:57,660
contrib we have another and bad tool

00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:01,530
that builds on top of it that can embed

00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:05,220
any entity in this case we are embedding

00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:07,650
an image but instead of being only to

00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:10,890
upload it like we have like the cases

00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:12,480
for core we can select it from a media

00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:15,320
library from the state media library

00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:19,080
have you seen in the previous video and

00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:21,270
you're not limited to images you can

00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:23,070
also embed nodes or commerce product

00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:27,120
sort some terms like everything that is

00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:31,350
an entity can be embedded so this is

00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:35,610
kind of it's an improvement both in user

00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:38,520
experience perspective is you can do

00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:41,850
like selection from the library and it's

00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:46,590
also improvement from the functionality

00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:49,169
perspective because we can embed much

00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:51,929
more than just in court then we also

00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:53,850
have cropping these are two modules and

00:18:51,929 --> 00:18:57,000
implement cropping this one is focal

00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:59,340
point which has this little cross here

00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,990
and you move that cross around and you

00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:02,790
basically say this is the part of the

00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:06,720
image that has the most information and

00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:08,549
then when crops are being generated do

00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:11,400
below make sure that that part of the

00:19:08,549 --> 00:19:13,500
image is always visible and then we have

00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:15,870
standard crop where we have rectangle

00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:23,370
rectangle and and we select the area

00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:26,730
that we want so we have a lot of things

00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:32,940
from this list we just don't have

00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:36,210
scaling and rotating images but I think

00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:39,799
that this is more from the initial

00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:42,240
upload perspective not from the

00:19:39,799 --> 00:19:44,250
perspective of image styles because

00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:46,559
right now how cropping works we just

00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:49,470
provide save this information about the

00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:51,150
crop the metadata and then when image

00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:55,440
styles are generated this is used to

00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:56,970
create correct crops for you some people

00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:00,120
would like to see

00:19:56,970 --> 00:20:02,730
something like mini Photoshop when you

00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:06,590
upload the image and to be actually able

00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:09,480
to edit the original for whatever reason

00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:14,070
so these are probably two different use

00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:25,470
cases and yeah so that second use case

00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:26,730
we don't solve yet the question was I

00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:28,620
need to repeat the question for the

00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:31,350
recording the question was if this

00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:34,980
cropping information is saved profile or

00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:40,710
per usage of this file right it saved

00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:45,059
profile we were looking into options to

00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:48,630
be able to save it / usage and actually

00:20:45,059 --> 00:20:53,669
saving it is not that hard the problem

00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:55,890
is that amidst our system doesn't have

00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:58,590
the concept of the usage of the image so

00:20:55,890 --> 00:21:00,559
your if you have a thumbnail image style

00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:03,210
you can have only one thumbnail

00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:06,510
derivative for a given image so it

00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:10,440
doesn't make much sense to store it and

00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:12,090
this is often people often ask this

00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:14,070
question and require this feature but

00:21:12,090 --> 00:21:20,039
this in order to support this we would

00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:24,900
need to improve or update how image

00:21:20,039 --> 00:21:28,610
stylist work so yeah we have everything

00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:31,320
let's go home we don't need anything

00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:35,510
fortunately that's not the case the

00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:38,840
first problem is that right now it's

00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:42,900
quite hard to put everything together

00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:47,640
there is a lot of moving pieces involved

00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:51,720
a lot of modules and you need some

00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:54,539
knowledge to be able to decide which of

00:21:51,720 --> 00:22:00,179
them you need and how to put them

00:21:54,539 --> 00:22:05,309
together this prospectus getting better

00:22:00,179 --> 00:22:07,159
as we get modules like media that are

00:22:05,309 --> 00:22:10,559
basically doing this for you or

00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:13,159
lightning distribution

00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:16,019
and like you can you can either use

00:22:13,159 --> 00:22:21,299
something as lightning or media module

00:22:16,019 --> 00:22:23,759
to to build this or you can use it as

00:22:21,299 --> 00:22:26,399
example you can study how that works and

00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:29,600
then figure out which pieces don't work

00:22:26,399 --> 00:22:33,960
for you and what do you need to change

00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:36,870
but the we still have a lot of work to

00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:39,059
do in this area the thing is that when

00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:42,350
when we started working on that two

00:22:39,059 --> 00:22:45,929
years ago we needed to build this

00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:47,639
underlying subsystems and it took us

00:22:45,929 --> 00:22:51,169
some time to do that and we needed to

00:22:47,639 --> 00:22:55,470
leave right some parts few times and

00:22:51,169 --> 00:22:57,619
just recently made a few months ago we

00:22:55,470 --> 00:23:00,840
were ready to start building this

00:22:57,619 --> 00:23:03,210
solution modules on top of the whole

00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:05,519
underlying basis and that's also the

00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:07,409
reason why medium module was the Summer

00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:10,350
of Code project this year and not maybe

00:23:07,409 --> 00:23:15,240
last year last year the pieces that

00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:19,019
media depends on weren't ready then we

00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:21,659
have inconsistent user experience a lot

00:23:19,019 --> 00:23:24,990
of times I just think about the example

00:23:21,659 --> 00:23:27,389
of the media library we're pretty early

00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:30,179
in the d8 life cycle and we can already

00:23:27,389 --> 00:23:32,730
have see three different completely

00:23:30,179 --> 00:23:35,549
different sub visual solutions Sinkin

00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:39,509
trip I wouldn't be surprised if there

00:23:35,549 --> 00:23:42,830
are more that I'm not aware of and we

00:23:39,509 --> 00:23:46,440
will definitely see even more of that

00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:49,470
and this is something where work or

00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:54,779
could do very important job to set the

00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:59,249
standard and tell contrib how to behave

00:23:54,779 --> 00:24:03,840
basically then we have some competing

00:23:59,249 --> 00:24:05,759
solutions which like it's much better

00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:08,159
than it used to be but it still waste of

00:24:05,759 --> 00:24:11,999
resources so it might be worth seeing if

00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:14,730
we can address that and the whole

00:24:11,999 --> 00:24:16,649
ecosystem it's not visible for

00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:20,429
first-time evaluators if somebody

00:24:16,649 --> 00:24:22,740
downloads roopa kaur is toss it you

00:24:20,429 --> 00:24:23,879
don't get anything any of those things

00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:28,259
that i showed

00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:30,329
or trip and for those people

00:24:28,259 --> 00:24:35,399
that basically means Drupal can't do

00:24:30,329 --> 00:24:38,399
that this fact is probably also a little

00:24:35,399 --> 00:24:40,349
bit mitigated by the fact that if you

00:24:38,399 --> 00:24:44,069
are service provider and if you are

00:24:40,349 --> 00:24:47,699
demoing Drupal to to prospective client

00:24:44,069 --> 00:24:50,129
you probably don't use or for that you

00:24:47,699 --> 00:24:53,779
probably use something either

00:24:50,129 --> 00:24:56,579
distribution something that you've built

00:24:53,779 --> 00:25:00,089
in-house or maybe reliant lightning to

00:24:56,579 --> 00:25:04,709
do it so I think that this problem is

00:25:00,089 --> 00:25:06,839
not so big for your client that get in

00:25:04,709 --> 00:25:09,329
touch with service providers or with

00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:12,929
professional companies it's more a

00:25:09,329 --> 00:25:17,489
problem for somebody that does it on its

00:25:12,929 --> 00:25:21,449
own like this might be a student looking

00:25:17,489 --> 00:25:26,009
for CMS to build the school newspaper

00:25:21,449 --> 00:25:29,459
website or maybe a CEO of a huge

00:25:26,009 --> 00:25:35,509
corporation or CTO more probable

00:25:29,459 --> 00:25:40,559
probably and both are important right so

00:25:35,509 --> 00:25:42,749
I guess there I think that we need to

00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:46,169
improve the situation in core if nothing

00:25:42,749 --> 00:25:49,169
else for to improve drupal's reputation

00:25:46,169 --> 00:25:52,379
in this area the question is how and I

00:25:49,169 --> 00:25:55,859
will propose few things that I think

00:25:52,379 --> 00:25:59,609
would make sense to do and then we can

00:25:55,859 --> 00:26:03,449
discuss about that so the first thing

00:25:59,609 --> 00:26:08,839
that I would do is good add support for

00:26:03,449 --> 00:26:11,879
remote media inc or not necessarily

00:26:08,839 --> 00:26:14,399
supporting all different sorts of remote

00:26:11,879 --> 00:26:18,509
media it would be in my opinion it will

00:26:14,399 --> 00:26:20,249
be enough to just have similar

00:26:18,509 --> 00:26:23,190
experience that we have now with images

00:26:20,249 --> 00:26:25,679
and files plus youtube videos for

00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:33,089
example because this covers majority of

00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:35,779
cases and yeah it also shows Drupal

00:26:33,089 --> 00:26:37,500
shows that it can do that and it sets

00:26:35,779 --> 00:26:39,570
pathways

00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:42,630
work on trip to extend for with

00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:50,460
different with to extend this with

00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:53,910
different types it would be very nice

00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:57,090
for this to be compatible with what we

00:26:53,910 --> 00:27:00,570
have currently in contract because if we

00:26:57,090 --> 00:27:04,920
don't do it that way then we left

00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:08,700
everyone behind and and this is the case

00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:12,090
like for currently it's possible to

00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:14,730
build Drupal web du Palais websites in

00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:18,650
few different ways when it comes to

00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:20,940
media and we need to support like

00:27:18,650 --> 00:27:23,940
they're basically two ways how you can

00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:27,020
do it and if we do something in core we

00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:38,970
should make sure that all these

00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:41,640
implementations still work yeah so my

00:27:38,970 --> 00:27:43,350
suggestion like I think that it would

00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:46,860
make sense to consider including media

00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:52,470
entity which the the remote remote media

00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:54,660
solution in infant rib in core it has

00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:57,570
quite a good adoption is maintained it

00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:59,820
already has a lot of plugins for a lot

00:27:57,570 --> 00:28:03,270
of video providers for slides for

00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:07,770
soundcloud for like quite a big number

00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:10,080
of different sources there is one

00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:13,200
problem though I think that this

00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:16,290
couldn't be an experimental thing like

00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:20,100
like big pipe is because we're dealing

00:28:16,290 --> 00:28:22,520
with with the data that you can you can

00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:28,860
have an experimental module that that

00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:30,330
improves some UI part and if if the way

00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:33,090
how you store your data in the database

00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:35,520
is is the same this really doesn't

00:28:33,090 --> 00:28:38,220
matter you just enable it or disabled it

00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:39,810
swap it for the new one or the old ones

00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:42,900
that everything still works for you but

00:28:39,810 --> 00:28:46,350
if you change the the way how data is

00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:48,540
stored then I think it's not responsible

00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:50,630
to say that this is experimental if we

00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:53,950
give people tools we

00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:57,170
to make sure that they're day they safe

00:28:53,950 --> 00:28:59,030
so this is a little bit of a

00:28:57,170 --> 00:29:04,550
disadvantage because it gives us less

00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:07,760
room to experiment and one way I think

00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:11,770
we could do it would be to at some point

00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:14,750
at some minor release like for example

00:29:11,770 --> 00:29:18,560
include media everything for and then

00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:21,620
update the standard profile to start

00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:24,680
using it from that point on and don't

00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:26,330
migrate the sites that were implemented

00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:28,250
before that because I think that would

00:29:26,330 --> 00:29:32,060
create a lot of problems before people

00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:34,550
and since all the pieces that the our

00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:36,680
ink or that this size are relying on are

00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:38,630
still there stay there are not going

00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:42,410
anywhere these sites will continue

00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:45,250
working and all the contributing that

00:29:42,410 --> 00:29:49,220
depend on that will continue to function

00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:52,070
and then maybe provide an optional

00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:58,460
upgrade path for migration for this kind

00:29:52,070 --> 00:30:00,530
of sites in a contrib or a second

00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:04,040
experimental module I don't know and

00:30:00,530 --> 00:30:06,440
then make sure that everything is

00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:09,560
migrated correctly for denied so I

00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:12,290
wouldn't force if we do change like that

00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:14,840
I wouldn't force all the existing

00:30:12,290 --> 00:30:16,970
website to adopt it I would just do it

00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:22,330
for four sides that are being installed

00:30:16,970 --> 00:30:26,120
from there on there is an issue for that

00:30:22,330 --> 00:30:28,310
if you want to get involved check and

00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:31,820
check this URL and I will tweet the

00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:36,410
slides and put them on the session page

00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:38,600
on conference website so you can get it

00:30:36,410 --> 00:30:45,310
from there no need to take pictures with

00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:45,310
your phones then we have a media library

00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:51,620
assuming that we would do the first step

00:30:48,530 --> 00:30:55,160
this basically becomes just a view of of

00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:59,630
those media entities we have lots of

00:30:55,160 --> 00:31:02,240
examples equivalent contribs we take the

00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:02,720
best what is in there right now improve

00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:05,980
the you

00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:10,070
add features more advanced filters and

00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:14,059
by doing that we set standards in core

00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:18,200
and then for example assuming that that

00:31:14,059 --> 00:31:20,120
each item in this library is rendered as

00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:22,250
a full entity with a special view mode

00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:26,710
for you like like that library view mode

00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:30,580
then if you have modules in contribute

00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:34,700
provide support for other media types

00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:38,179
these modules just need to provide sandy

00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:42,590
falls forward for that remote and then

00:31:38,179 --> 00:31:45,110
theoretically this media types that

00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:46,669
would be added later would nicely appear

00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:50,799
in the same library and we got

00:31:46,669 --> 00:31:54,200
consistent consistent appearance and

00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:58,010
since this is core a lot more people see

00:31:54,200 --> 00:32:00,080
it it is quite probably that the doers

00:31:58,010 --> 00:32:03,289
experience would be much better in the

00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:06,110
first place there is already an issue

00:32:03,289 --> 00:32:08,780
and there are some discussion going on

00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:11,360
in terms of prototypes and mocks the

00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:14,570
media library prototype that you've seen

00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:16,640
addresses keynote is from that issue so

00:32:14,570 --> 00:32:20,929
if you are interested in these kind of

00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:24,350
things please check that especially if

00:32:20,929 --> 00:32:29,020
you are interested in UX and design this

00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:29,020
is perfect time to get involved in there

00:32:31,179 --> 00:32:41,270
then with the wig embedding the problem

00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:45,860
if we do the first step if we update the

00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:49,039
way how media is stored in core it means

00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:51,020
that by default they are not images

00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:56,900
anymore which means that embedding of

00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:58,669
images kind of conflicts with that so we

00:32:56,900 --> 00:33:03,549
need something more powerful if we would

00:32:58,669 --> 00:33:08,179
be to do that and we already have this

00:33:03,549 --> 00:33:12,260
entity in bed module in in contrib that

00:33:08,179 --> 00:33:14,809
allows you to embed any entity it comes

00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:15,680
with some dependencies with quite

00:33:14,809 --> 00:33:19,190
powerful this

00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:22,070
configuration of few plug-in types it's

00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:25,490
quite complex but the basic underlying

00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:28,130
thing that that is the meat of this

00:33:25,490 --> 00:33:31,310
module is basically the text filter that

00:33:28,130 --> 00:33:33,860
converts the embed tag into a rendered

00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:36,010
entity and I think that we could move

00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:41,560
that into the core and then we have

00:33:36,010 --> 00:33:46,900
support for embedding any entity in core

00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:50,840
so we solve that problem and we could

00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:56,180
make like a simpler feature set maybe

00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:58,070
just allowing people to to to select the

00:33:56,180 --> 00:34:00,650
View mode and then render the entity

00:33:58,070 --> 00:34:04,160
with the view mode instead of having

00:34:00,650 --> 00:34:06,200
ability to use field for matters and the

00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:12,290
custom plugins and a lot of other stuff

00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:14,630
like we have in contribute is and if if

00:34:12,290 --> 00:34:17,090
we do it in a way that that allows us to

00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:19,580
extend this we can still rely on contrib

00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:23,390
of on entity embed module to provide

00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:27,650
this advanced display configuration

00:34:23,390 --> 00:34:30,790
options while core could have the filter

00:34:27,650 --> 00:34:45,100
which is the most important part and

00:34:30,790 --> 00:34:45,100
simplified UI to yes

00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:32,960
yeah just repeat the comment was that

00:35:28,069 --> 00:35:35,270
it's important to allow teamers to have

00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:37,099
full control over rendering of this

00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:41,329
embedded thing right and I completely

00:35:37,099 --> 00:35:44,240
agree with you over yeah there's an

00:35:41,329 --> 00:35:52,970
issue where hopefully discussion about

00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:57,490
this will will emerge then we have

00:35:52,970 --> 00:36:00,890
reusability problem reusability is

00:35:57,490 --> 00:36:05,210
mainly solved with entity browser module

00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:08,839
in contrib right now entity browser it's

00:36:05,210 --> 00:36:11,390
fairly new concept it was built for d8

00:36:08,839 --> 00:36:18,079
and it's also fairly complex with a lot

00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:21,410
of plugins and I I don't think it would

00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:27,619
be ready to be including at this

00:36:21,410 --> 00:36:32,180
point so what I think would be the best

00:36:27,619 --> 00:36:34,700
way for now is to create like simple

00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:37,220
listing that is based on the look and

00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:40,940
feel of that media library that we would

00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:46,099
hopefully have and allow people to to

00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:50,589
use that to reuse things but with a bit

00:36:46,099 --> 00:36:54,140
limited feature set maybe just having a

00:36:50,589 --> 00:36:57,619
list of media entities where you can

00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:59,270
pick something from would be enough even

00:36:57,619 --> 00:37:03,770
without filters it would be way better

00:36:59,270 --> 00:37:05,510
than what we have now and then either

00:37:03,770 --> 00:37:08,750
incrementally improve this in court or

00:37:05,510 --> 00:37:12,599
rely on

00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:16,200
contribute to to to extend it for more

00:37:12,599 --> 00:37:19,200
more complex use cases and maybe see

00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:25,980
later maybe 49 if something like entity

00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:30,780
browser could end up in core so we would

00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:35,550
have more flexibility there and with

00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:40,319
this approach we would cover most of

00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:45,390
this use cases in core itself maybe not

00:37:40,319 --> 00:37:48,359
with the full feature set but like if we

00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:50,190
provide something basic for for people

00:37:48,359 --> 00:37:53,510
that are evaluating Drupal is definitely

00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:55,650
way better than than what we have now

00:37:53,510 --> 00:38:00,359
the only thing that we completely left

00:37:55,650 --> 00:38:03,450
out is scrubbing which yeah we could

00:38:00,359 --> 00:38:05,609
discuss about but I think that this is

00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:13,160
already more than enough work for some

00:38:05,609 --> 00:38:13,160
time the another advantage of this

00:38:13,490 --> 00:38:20,280
proposal is that it heavily relies on

00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:22,349
stuff that is already contributing

00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:27,319
everything from scratch but using things

00:38:22,349 --> 00:38:30,660
that exist already and just improve them

00:38:27,319 --> 00:38:37,670
and that saves us a lot of time and lot

00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:41,549
of energy but we still need people

00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:45,329
mostly people and also money I think

00:38:41,549 --> 00:38:49,460
that it's not realistic to expect that a

00:38:45,329 --> 00:38:57,319
group of volunteers will pop up and and

00:38:49,460 --> 00:39:04,829
do this because it's a huge job and

00:38:57,319 --> 00:39:08,400
people have lives one way we could do

00:39:04,829 --> 00:39:11,640
this and this has been proven to be very

00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:14,490
successful in the past is dedicated week

00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:19,380
good week long focused prints we've done

00:39:14,490 --> 00:39:21,270
this attempted systems two times for

00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:26,440
just media itself

00:39:21,270 --> 00:39:29,050
we usually have sprint like that in New

00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:32,350
York at New York hemp the latest example

00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:36,190
was sprint that happened after this

00:39:32,350 --> 00:39:38,910
year's nice can and we basically rented

00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:41,680
an Airbnb and were there for a week and

00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:45,700
we're sleeping there and eating in

00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:48,490
restaurants around the block and we were

00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:50,650
able and at some point it was just two

00:39:48,490 --> 00:39:52,600
of us we started with four people and

00:39:50,650 --> 00:39:54,940
then three people and then at the end we

00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:57,370
were just too but we pushed forward

00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:59,890
things that were stuck in the issue

00:39:57,370 --> 00:40:01,870
queue for months and if we would be able

00:39:59,890 --> 00:40:07,570
to do this with a little bit bigger

00:40:01,870 --> 00:40:11,140
group more often then achieving these

00:40:07,570 --> 00:40:15,490
goals I i think it's it's not that and

00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:17,190
unrealistic that it sounds it's nice to

00:40:15,490 --> 00:40:20,980
have Sprint's on events like this

00:40:17,190 --> 00:40:24,370
because you can get new contributors but

00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:27,130
it's extremely hard to focus on events

00:40:24,370 --> 00:40:28,960
like Drew pecans we had a lot of

00:40:27,130 --> 00:40:31,810
interesting discussions in the past a

00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:35,500
lot of interesting decisions but not

00:40:31,810 --> 00:40:39,280
much actual features came out of those

00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:43,390
prints while on this focused prints

00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:46,650
where we were isolated from all the

00:40:43,390 --> 00:40:49,690
distractions results were much better

00:40:46,650 --> 00:40:52,720
and in order to do that we basically

00:40:49,690 --> 00:40:55,360
need some money not much to rent a place

00:40:52,720 --> 00:41:01,150
like that to fly people there and to

00:40:55,360 --> 00:41:03,220
provide some food and either ability to

00:41:01,150 --> 00:41:05,890
I don't know pay people to count there

00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:09,250
but even better if their employers would

00:41:05,890 --> 00:41:11,020
say okay this is our sponsorship towards

00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:13,330
the community towards the initiative I

00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:17,470
will send my senior developer X

00:41:13,330 --> 00:41:20,170
therefore a mouth for a week and leave

00:41:17,470 --> 00:41:22,960
him out of the daily stuff as much as I

00:41:20,170 --> 00:41:26,190
can to be able to focus on this and if

00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:29,400
we would do a few Sprint's like that for

00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:32,420
minor release cycle I think we could

00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:42,509
move mountains

00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:45,809
question yeah the question was if that

00:41:42,509 --> 00:41:48,959
could be combined with any event sure it

00:41:45,809 --> 00:41:51,599
can be but from my experience if it's

00:41:48,959 --> 00:41:54,150
part of the event if it happens at the

00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:56,249
same time as event is happening there is

00:41:54,150 --> 00:41:58,469
so many interesting things going on at

00:41:56,249 --> 00:42:01,199
the same time that people won't be able

00:41:58,469 --> 00:42:05,819
to focus like in New York we didn't do

00:42:01,199 --> 00:42:08,729
it on the actual days of the camp but we

00:42:05,819 --> 00:42:12,779
did it afterwards after the camp for a

00:42:08,729 --> 00:42:15,599
week we stayed there and we were able to

00:42:12,779 --> 00:42:23,939
focus much much more than we would be

00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:25,650
able as part of the camp yeah it's

00:42:23,939 --> 00:42:28,880
definitely better with still a lot of

00:42:25,650 --> 00:42:32,189
people it's pretty very general event

00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:34,709
it's very easy to be pulled out of of

00:42:32,189 --> 00:42:36,749
this and into something else where

00:42:34,709 --> 00:42:39,269
discussions are happening and stuff like

00:42:36,749 --> 00:42:41,939
that so I think that if we can have

00:42:39,269 --> 00:42:49,859
something that is really focused it's

00:42:41,939 --> 00:42:52,650
much more productive so we're dedicated

00:42:49,859 --> 00:42:56,189
to help as I already mentioned we are

00:42:52,650 --> 00:42:58,549
thriving we're trying to invest roughly

00:42:56,189 --> 00:43:04,039
twenty percent of every project that

00:42:58,549 --> 00:43:07,619
that we have back into the community and

00:43:04,039 --> 00:43:10,289
md systems has been one of the major

00:43:07,619 --> 00:43:13,469
supporters of the media initiative in

00:43:10,289 --> 00:43:17,779
the past and something like this would

00:43:13,469 --> 00:43:17,779
be happening we're definitely part of it

00:43:19,429 --> 00:43:26,429
this is obligatory slide come to

00:43:23,999 --> 00:43:29,309
sprint's if you are a first-time

00:43:26,429 --> 00:43:32,059
sprinter that's the wrong you should be

00:43:29,309 --> 00:43:35,749
in and you have mentored course print

00:43:32,059 --> 00:43:38,429
another room and general sprints if you

00:43:35,749 --> 00:43:42,840
if you know what you want to do or if

00:43:38,429 --> 00:43:46,620
you join us come to general spreads

00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:49,690
you have to you don't have to we would

00:43:46,620 --> 00:43:52,710
kindly ask you to evaluate this session

00:43:49,690 --> 00:43:56,980
all sessions actually did you attend

00:43:52,710 --> 00:44:01,500
because this helps me and the conference

00:43:56,980 --> 00:44:04,540
organizers to be better next time and

00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:10,470
now it's time for the conversation part

00:44:04,540 --> 00:44:14,560
of Korra colonization any comments and

00:44:10,470 --> 00:44:24,490
ideas thoughts yeah can you can you go

00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:26,380
to the microphone please so what's the

00:44:24,490 --> 00:44:34,900
current state of things what's done by

00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:42,130
that moment thanks di referring to core

00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:47,470
or Drupal ecosystem entirely mean do you

00:44:42,130 --> 00:44:53,500
have your starting modules that you or

00:44:47,470 --> 00:44:56,680
Jace based on the country module I'm not

00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:59,830
sure if I understand the question I mean

00:44:56,680 --> 00:45:05,380
do you have your own development already

00:44:59,830 --> 00:45:08,950
started so the question is if the

00:45:05,380 --> 00:45:12,550
development already started development

00:45:08,950 --> 00:45:15,760
has been going on in contrib for two

00:45:12,550 --> 00:45:18,520
years now and you have a lot of things

00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:20,890
in contrib already some of them which

00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:25,210
stable releases most of them with at

00:45:20,890 --> 00:45:27,390
least beta releases and all of these

00:45:25,210 --> 00:45:29,680
modules are already used on many sites

00:45:27,390 --> 00:45:32,800
so this is not something completely new

00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:35,770
that is being invented right now but

00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:38,860
it's rather like trying to improve that

00:45:35,770 --> 00:45:41,650
and move parts of the existing things

00:45:38,860 --> 00:45:45,390
into core right makes sense and where

00:45:41,650 --> 00:45:49,540
it's possible did I answer your question

00:45:45,390 --> 00:45:51,850
which part I didn't answer so you kind

00:45:49,540 --> 00:45:54,880
of go now lead on this right your

00:45:51,850 --> 00:45:59,019
company um

00:45:54,880 --> 00:46:01,599
I wouldn't say that it's many companies

00:45:59,019 --> 00:46:04,990
have been part and many individuals have

00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:08,549
been part of this initiative in the last

00:46:04,990 --> 00:46:14,319
few years we are one of them of course

00:46:08,549 --> 00:46:16,390
but many people invested into this in

00:46:14,319 --> 00:46:21,210
the past and it's not something that is

00:46:16,390 --> 00:46:23,980
like our thing that we want to promote

00:46:21,210 --> 00:46:25,839
into the community but it's something

00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:28,509
that has been going on in the community

00:46:25,839 --> 00:46:50,140
in a very open way for a long time now

00:46:28,509 --> 00:46:52,180
and we've been part of it that issue was

00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:54,579
created recently I think I created last

00:46:52,180 --> 00:46:57,549
week also the comment question was that

00:46:54,579 --> 00:47:03,160
that issues of fishy about media doesn't

00:46:57,549 --> 00:47:07,000
have any comments and it was created

00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:10,930
based on based on my preparations for

00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:13,289
this conversation and we have few more

00:47:10,930 --> 00:47:18,569
discussions planned for this week and

00:47:13,289 --> 00:47:25,980
hopefully we will see what ideas

00:47:18,569 --> 00:47:25,980
conclusions about this are this week yes

00:48:11,509 --> 00:48:21,059
so the question was if this what we're

00:48:16,349 --> 00:48:24,089
talking about here is support it should

00:48:21,059 --> 00:48:26,869
work with the workflow the tools that

00:48:24,089 --> 00:48:29,910
workflow initiative is working on and

00:48:26,869 --> 00:48:36,750
moving into core or some pieces already

00:48:29,910 --> 00:48:40,049
are in the corn and the example that you

00:48:36,750 --> 00:48:42,150
gave was the embedding so if I

00:48:40,049 --> 00:48:45,059
understood correctly if there could be

00:48:42,150 --> 00:48:46,829
problems if you embed something into

00:48:45,059 --> 00:48:52,049
visa week and then use the ploy module

00:48:46,829 --> 00:48:57,569
to deploy this some other instance we

00:48:52,049 --> 00:48:59,430
try to do everything to be a standard as

00:48:57,569 --> 00:49:05,660
possible we have standard entity types

00:48:59,430 --> 00:49:09,420
and for example for embedding we are not

00:49:05,660 --> 00:49:11,789
embedding the rendered version of the

00:49:09,420 --> 00:49:15,269
entity that's being embedded we just

00:49:11,789 --> 00:49:19,049
stored the reference in a special custom

00:49:15,269 --> 00:49:23,940
tag and to store that reference we use

00:49:19,049 --> 00:49:28,589
uid we don't use the entity ID and main

00:49:23,940 --> 00:49:32,640
reason for that was to support cases

00:49:28,589 --> 00:49:34,710
like that disclaimer i personally Levin

00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:37,309
never tried that but in theory should

00:49:34,710 --> 00:49:37,309
work I

00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:56,920
I don't ride it with the most updated

00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:58,840
version of those two but I have

00:49:56,920 --> 00:50:01,840
successfully used those modules to

00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:04,000
before that and employees not only the

00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:08,290
actual asset file that you need to

00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:11,350
render identity but it it deploys that

00:50:08,290 --> 00:50:14,590
rendered code as you explain you're not

00:50:11,350 --> 00:50:17,200
like it's just an entity right it's

00:50:14,590 --> 00:50:19,930
it's technically content that has a tag

00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:21,520
that gets replaced so the big deal was

00:50:19,930 --> 00:50:24,400
you know making sure you got the file

00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:27,550
over in the right place so deploy

00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:29,830
resolves all those dependencies and and

00:50:27,550 --> 00:50:32,740
it didn't initially work but we work on

00:50:29,830 --> 00:50:35,410
that and got that fixed so now whether

00:50:32,740 --> 00:50:37,840
that will go in a core part of the

00:50:35,410 --> 00:50:42,700
workflow I'm not sure because that was a

00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:44,560
contributing another contribute so if if

00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:46,720
it's not in core it can't be moved into

00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:49,060
course so it is a chance that you'll

00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:51,360
probably still have to use some of the

00:50:49,060 --> 00:50:56,050
concern stuff within the workflow but

00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:58,420
along answer yes it works now the answer

00:50:56,050 --> 00:51:06,930
from the audience was stata basically

00:50:58,420 --> 00:51:06,930
works yes

00:51:23,790 --> 00:51:33,420
so the question is about fire visioning

00:51:29,010 --> 00:51:38,120
and if that is the scope I think that

00:51:33,420 --> 00:51:42,290
there is a scope I believe that

00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:44,880
revisions in media entity should work

00:51:42,290 --> 00:51:48,480
and i'm not sure what the state is in

00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:51,510
valentino with file entity which is a

00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:55,530
module in contrib that extends core

00:51:51,510 --> 00:52:00,480
files it doesn't work and the main issue

00:51:55,530 --> 00:52:04,260
as far as I understand is that as if you

00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:07,940
have a file as a full-featured entity

00:52:04,260 --> 00:52:11,340
with fields and everything it's easy to

00:52:07,940 --> 00:52:15,360
revision fields but how do you revision

00:52:11,340 --> 00:52:19,250
file itself do we store multiple copies

00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:19,250
of this file on the disk or

00:52:43,150 --> 00:52:53,210
yes so the main issue is how to solve

00:52:47,630 --> 00:52:56,440
this revision of the file itself and I

00:52:53,210 --> 00:52:56,440
don't have answer to that sir

00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:25,690
the answer from the audience core has a

00:53:22,810 --> 00:53:30,070
new critical ish critical bug this I

00:53:25,690 --> 00:53:32,830
guess since yesterday exactly four

00:53:30,070 --> 00:53:34,780
because of this problem where files can

00:53:32,830 --> 00:53:38,530
be deleted where we don't want them to

00:53:34,780 --> 00:53:40,860
be deleted and we will stop deleting

00:53:38,530 --> 00:53:43,720
files when they are unused by default

00:53:40,860 --> 00:53:47,910
while still allowing people to enable

00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:47,910
that if they need

00:54:07,010 --> 00:54:15,150
the question was that it seems that the

00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:18,090
comment and the question was that it

00:54:15,150 --> 00:54:21,890
seems that the biggest pain in the butt

00:54:18,090 --> 00:54:24,990
is the part where we transitioned from

00:54:21,890 --> 00:54:28,500
faster media entities and the question

00:54:24,990 --> 00:54:31,130
was if if media entities are built on

00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:36,290
top of file entities the answer is

00:54:31,130 --> 00:54:41,460
basically yes because for local media

00:54:36,290 --> 00:54:46,350
media entity like has a file field on it

00:54:41,460 --> 00:54:48,030
and this is how it it references the the

00:54:46,350 --> 00:54:50,430
file how it brings the file into the

00:54:48,030 --> 00:54:52,350
mega entity it's not depending on file

00:54:50,430 --> 00:54:56,670
entity because it doesn't need it to do

00:54:52,350 --> 00:54:58,440
that it just needs what is in core but

00:54:56,670 --> 00:55:00,060
yeah that's why I also said that all the

00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:02,910
pieces are currently in core are not

00:55:00,060 --> 00:55:06,540
conflicting and should stay in Cory if

00:55:02,910 --> 00:55:09,960
we end up doing that and for for remote

00:55:06,540 --> 00:55:12,720
media it's doing it in a completely

00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:17,640
different way entirely mostly by

00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:20,250
referencing links to by storing links or

00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:22,650
embed codes to that remote media and

00:55:20,250 --> 00:55:25,950
have some logic to be able to parse that

00:55:22,650 --> 00:55:29,869
than to identify am sorry correct IDs

00:55:25,950 --> 00:55:29,869
and set cetera

00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:58,830
the question is what we do with current

00:55:53,790 --> 00:56:01,200
you I sink or if we do that you cannot

00:55:58,830 --> 00:56:03,660
use current field types with the media

00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:06,060
entity because image field and file

00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:07,560
field are limited just to file so you

00:56:06,060 --> 00:56:12,560
need to use something else which

00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:18,360
probably the answer is entity reference

00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:22,980
and I would say like my initial idea is

00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:26,150
to to create a different widget for

00:56:22,980 --> 00:56:29,490
entity reference with possibly similar

00:56:26,150 --> 00:56:34,670
user experience to the one that we have

00:56:29,490 --> 00:56:37,860
now so this would hide the complexity

00:56:34,670 --> 00:56:41,010
significantly while still relying on

00:56:37,860 --> 00:56:45,300
this new thing for the underlying part

00:56:41,010 --> 00:56:47,970
that could be one solution because sorry

00:56:45,300 --> 00:56:49,830
because at the end of the day no matter

00:56:47,970 --> 00:56:51,810
if you have a file or a media entity

00:56:49,830 --> 00:56:54,720
when you upload files it just uploading

00:56:51,810 --> 00:56:58,350
the file and creating an entity out of

00:56:54,720 --> 00:57:02,070
it we're also doing this now of file is

00:56:58,350 --> 00:57:07,560
an entity in core already so it's not

00:57:02,070 --> 00:57:26,820
that important what kind of entity who

00:57:07,560 --> 00:57:30,470
was first back there was first sorry so

00:57:26,820 --> 00:57:33,210
the question was if I could talk about

00:57:30,470 --> 00:57:37,260
how to avoid the same problems that

00:57:33,210 --> 00:57:44,070
media module had in 7 which is trying to

00:57:37,260 --> 00:57:47,310
do too much in in one bag and the answer

00:57:44,070 --> 00:57:50,130
is that we this is the first problem

00:57:47,310 --> 00:57:52,260
that we're trying to address two years

00:57:50,130 --> 00:57:54,600
ago where we had this initial

00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:58,050
discussions about how this ecosystem

00:57:54,600 --> 00:58:00,210
will look for d8 and our solution to

00:57:58,050 --> 00:58:05,220
that was instead of having one huge

00:58:00,210 --> 00:58:06,839
module that does everything to separate

00:58:05,220 --> 00:58:09,270
into smaller pieces that live

00:58:06,839 --> 00:58:12,030
independently in contraband then a

00:58:09,270 --> 00:58:14,130
module like media depends on them and

00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:16,170
provides default configuration and

00:58:14,130 --> 00:58:20,609
that's what is basically happening right

00:58:16,170 --> 00:58:25,200
now this approach introduced a new

00:58:20,609 --> 00:58:27,119
problem that is like a lot of hidden

00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:31,349
things a lot of knowledge that you need

00:58:27,119 --> 00:58:33,230
to be actually able to build things but

00:58:31,349 --> 00:58:36,480
i think if we provide saying defaults

00:58:33,230 --> 00:58:40,140
nice default modules that that that

00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:42,000
build things for you then we've solved

00:58:40,140 --> 00:58:45,270
this problem and another problem that

00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:48,420
media had in the seven was the fact that

00:58:45,270 --> 00:58:53,130
it was unstable for basically the entire

00:58:48,420 --> 00:58:55,260
cycle and at least for this underlying

00:58:53,130 --> 00:58:57,839
basic parts infantry we don't have any

00:58:55,260 --> 00:59:01,790
problem because all of them except into

00:58:57,839 --> 00:59:03,900
the browser are already beta which means

00:59:01,790 --> 00:59:09,210
everything should be backward compatible

00:59:03,900 --> 00:59:11,070
and even with entity browser there are

00:59:09,210 --> 00:59:13,890
no changes planned that would break

00:59:11,070 --> 00:59:15,630
backward compatibility it's just more

00:59:13,890 --> 00:59:18,869
the fact that there are some quite

00:59:15,630 --> 00:59:25,170
complex bugs and we would like to fix

00:59:18,869 --> 00:59:27,690
them before we dedicate to that there

00:59:25,170 --> 00:59:32,609
are few more questions but I think that

00:59:27,690 --> 00:59:35,970
our time is up but I'm happy to continue

00:59:32,609 --> 00:59:40,700
chatting in front of the room thank you

00:59:35,970 --> 00:59:40,700
everyone for coming and hope

00:59:47,310 --> 00:59:55,080
so question I was thinking that not all

00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:55,080
