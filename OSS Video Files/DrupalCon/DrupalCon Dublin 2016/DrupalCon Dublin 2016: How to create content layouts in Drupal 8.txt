Title: DrupalCon Dublin 2016: How to create content layouts in Drupal 8
Publication date: 2016-09-27
Playlist: DrupalCon Dublin 2016
Description: 
	Creating layouts in Drupal is easy right? As site builders we can pick from variety of tools to do the job - Panels, Panelizer, Display suite, Ckeditor styles & templates or Paragraphs to name a few.

Join Inky & dasjo for a run-down of the considerations we have taken in 3 years of experience building real-world projects based on Drupal 8. Weâ€™ll do a comparison of the existing tools to implement content layouts in Drupal 8, explain what has changed from Drupal 7 and for which task you wanna choose which of the tools. This session is for you, if you want to

Take informed decisions when creating content layouts in Drupal 8

Find out if your best-practice from Drupal 7 still applies to Drupal 8

Know when to use which tools when creating content layouts

Compare Panels, Panelizer, Display suite, Ckeditor styles & templates + Paragraphs

Take a look behind the scenes of real-world Drupal 8 content layout implementations

Understand implications like multilingual, workflows & the level of freedom you want to allow your content editors to have

This session will be suitable for anyone interested in the architectural decisions behind setting up content layout workflows for Drupal 8. While site builders are the main audience, we are happy to invite coders better understand the content workflows, front-enders to get an understanding of what kind of content-structure they can ask for and content editors/clients get a feeling of which tools they might wanna use once their site has been built.

going about how to build content layouts

00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,090
in Drupal 8 we are pretty excited to be

00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:20,160
presenting together for the first time

00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:22,050
yeah let's just jump in as you can see

layouts so who we are let's start with

00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:46,350
Enki currently the project manager and

00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:50,039
amazing labs in Cape Town I've been

00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:52,620
working with Drupal since Drupal 6 2009

00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:54,690
up until last year when I joined Yumi's

00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:56,399
labs I was working as a freelancer so I

00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:58,379
was doing the full scope of projects

site building front-end everything

00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:02,699
myself so it's not that I'm just a

00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:05,729
project manager I'm also a site builder

00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:08,700
developer as well I've been involved in

community in Cape Town for quite a few

00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:23,509
years and yeah this is my first Drupal

00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:26,220
con it's not my first true pecan

00:01:23,509 --> 00:01:28,080

really passionate about the trooper

00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:42,509
community all over the world and yeah so

00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:46,049
my role at the Mazie is I'm a tech lead

00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:47,399
that doesn't mean like working a lot

00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:49,409
with code at the moment that mainly

00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:52,020
means guiding the team supporting the

00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:54,360
team in taking decisions and I've been

00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:56,610
doing a Drupal a lot back then in Drupal

00:01:54,360 --> 00:02:05,340
6 and 7 as the site builder so that's

00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:10,810
why we both of us kind of share besides

00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:12,400
Drupal we both work for me

00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:15,250
meet for the first time in real life

00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:18,130
yesterday so we've been putting this

00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:20,280
together across continents and the other

00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:22,690
thing that we have in common is cycling

00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:26,140
hands up who has heard about George

00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:28,480
RuPaul yeah that's that's a pretty big

00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:34,030
number and who has been cycling for to

00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:36,610
the drupal this summer nobody so there's

00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:38,800
six people that have cycled and yeah

00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:41,200
both inky and me are really passionate

00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,060
about the topic cycling apart from

00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,730
drupal in general so that's gonna be the

00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:47,590
base theme and what we're going to talk

00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:49,630
about today apart from the general

00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:52,600
introduction like explain a bit set the

00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:56,760
baseline who of you has worked with

00:02:52,600 --> 00:03:01,720
Drupal eight already awesome Wow okay so

00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:03,430
kind of learn so much sorry so we're

00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:06,040
gonna give you an overview how to create

00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:07,690
like landing pages for example and then

00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:09,670
we're gonna jump into a couple of

00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:12,220
different approaches and we're gonna

00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:14,290
explain that by like we should week

00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:17,769
versus paragraphs displays suit versus

00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:19,209
context analyzer and tweak templates so

00:03:17,769 --> 00:03:22,630
we're gonna really show a real-world

00:03:19,209 --> 00:03:25,359
example by talking about all of these

00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:27,370
top these topics and hopefully there's

00:03:25,359 --> 00:03:28,930
gonna be room for Q&A to kind of find

00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:33,910
out what are the current questions that

00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:35,799
you have yes so the big picture we said

00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:37,569
okay we're both really into cycling so

00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:41,410
obviously we wanted to create a site

00:03:37,569 --> 00:03:45,100
together remotely like on a shared

00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:46,750
development environment using CMI so the

00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:48,370
big topic is it's gonna be a cycling

00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:53,859
site and Inc Inc is going to walk us

00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:56,829
through the topics website around

00:03:53,859 --> 00:03:58,209
cycling what would you need and for

00:03:56,829 --> 00:04:00,340
anyone you would want to find out a way

00:03:58,209 --> 00:04:03,040
to go and where's a good route so one of

00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:06,420
the content types would be routes which

00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:09,100
would have a description about it and

00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:11,230
then obviously you need cyclists to sign

00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:14,500
up so the cyclists are the user profiles

00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:18,359
and cyclists also have generally

00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:22,090
multiple bicycles it's always in +1 and

00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:23,770
user profiles and the

00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:26,440
sometimes part of clubs for our case

00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:28,840
that we are and so we've got clubs as

00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:32,110
another content type that all three then

00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:33,820
pull together and maybe to set the stage

00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:36,310
of it this is site building so don't

00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:39,190
expect us to have a fancy theme on top

00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:43,360
of it this is usually done done by our

00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:45,160
our other great team members yes so

00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:48,340
there's a lot of possibilities how to

00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:51,460
approach this and we come from different

00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:52,870
backgrounds so we actually obviously the

00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:55,270
the fun part about doing a presentation

00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:56,410
together to figure out like what are

00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:58,720
their purchased I think II would take

00:04:56,410 --> 00:05:00,639
whatever purchase that I would take so I

00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:03,130
personally more come from a panels

00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:05,110
background and in group of seven amazing

00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:06,580
labs in general we specialized on doing

00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:08,110
everything with panels because we know

00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:10,240
okay there's parent panelists everywhere

00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:12,310
for the big page there's panels for the

00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,500
landing pages there's penalize er for

00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:18,039
the content pages but I also see that

00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:26,080
there's a point maybe for ya I was using

00:05:18,039 --> 00:05:27,910
contacts a lot using and every aspect of

00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:30,250
my site was built with context and the

00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:32,710
journey views blocks generating content

00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:34,720
and it's been really great for me and

00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:36,160
one of the reasons that I chose context

00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,380
at one point other panels

00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:41,200
was just because the HTML that is

00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:42,940
generated as much cleaner and panels for

00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:44,440
me it was just crazy to try and work out

00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:46,210
at what level I'm trying to theme

00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:47,440
something and there was always something

00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:50,740
over running something else of me

00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:52,330
context simply cleaner way to go let's

00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:56,530
get a feeling who is under context side

00:05:52,330 --> 00:06:03,010
of of the hemisphere okay

00:05:56,530 --> 00:06:04,560
come on join me panels okay so for

00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:06,970
triple-eight that's definitely something

00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:09,070
as amazing we have been starting

00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:11,080
building to palade such to eat two years

00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:12,940
ago already so it's it's a constant

00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:14,620
changing targets which of the modules

00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:16,720
are available so what we're gonna talk

00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:18,580
about today is going to be a bit more

00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:23,800
than we have been using like two years

00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:26,979
ago obviously let's set the baseline who

00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:30,840
of you has started stupa only within the

00:06:26,979 --> 00:06:33,969
last year cool welcome awesome so

00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:35,289
probably you already know how the basics

00:06:33,969 --> 00:06:38,409
work but i just quickly

00:06:35,289 --> 00:06:40,029
reiterate so there's themes in Drupal we

00:06:38,409 --> 00:06:41,919
can download modules they add

00:06:40,029 --> 00:06:46,619
functionality and we can download themes

00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:49,899
they do the styling of the website and

00:06:46,619 --> 00:06:51,309
it's important to know that but so we

00:06:49,899 --> 00:06:54,849
have the content area which is kind of

00:06:51,309 --> 00:06:57,759
the magic big center and then around it

00:06:54,849 --> 00:07:00,189
any theme can define any kind any number

00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:01,599
of regions so we can see for example I

00:07:00,189 --> 00:07:03,849
would be a header region it would be

00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:05,770
sidebar site per to this picture is

00:07:03,849 --> 00:07:08,259
really old we don't suggest anyone to

00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:09,699
build the sidebar region anymore but

00:07:08,259 --> 00:07:11,499
just for historical reasons or to

00:07:09,699 --> 00:07:14,589
understand how the system works

00:07:11,499 --> 00:07:18,939
obviously we yeah sidebar is just a bad

00:07:14,589 --> 00:07:21,069
idea at all so we can place blocks into

00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:23,379
it and between Drupal 7 interpolate a

00:07:21,069 --> 00:07:25,449
lot of stuff has been converted to

00:07:23,379 --> 00:07:28,709
blocks which is inky's going to talk

00:07:25,449 --> 00:07:31,869
about as well and every every of these

00:07:28,709 --> 00:07:34,180
it's like a like an onion so the whole

00:07:31,869 --> 00:07:36,279
page is a template and the region is a

00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:37,809
template every block is a template and

00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:40,209
within those blocks all the contents

00:07:37,809 --> 00:07:42,519
also have suffix templates for example

00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:44,319
each field would be a template kind of

00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:46,180
to set the baseline what what are the

00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:52,689
tools the Trouper core basically

00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:55,479
provides us with yes so now with those

00:07:52,689 --> 00:07:57,129
plus also with some additional stuff we

00:07:55,479 --> 00:08:06,189
were thinking ok what are the options

00:07:57,129 --> 00:08:08,229
that we can use to to build stuff piece

00:08:06,189 --> 00:08:09,819
of content around the site and then

00:08:08,229 --> 00:08:11,860
obviously within the content area itself

00:08:09,819 --> 00:08:14,199
using WYSIWYG to be able to do layouts

00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:16,990
and content within just the content of

00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:19,269
the node itself something that's being

00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:21,249
used slightly in Drupal 7 but I think in

00:08:19,269 --> 00:08:25,899
Drupal 8 now it's become quite a big

00:08:21,249 --> 00:08:27,569
thing as paragraphs and you've got one

00:08:25,899 --> 00:08:30,969
of your options

00:08:27,569 --> 00:08:34,120
yep so so there's like a lot of ways

00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:36,789
we're using this place we Tinky's using

00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:38,709
context there's panelizer and panels

00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:41,079
there's two templates so all of these

00:08:38,709 --> 00:08:42,909
options are available now the tricky

00:08:41,079 --> 00:08:44,649
question is to figure out when are we

00:08:42,909 --> 00:08:47,680
gonna use what and what are they good

00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:48,700
for and one good argument that we had is

00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,740
like well the

00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:52,810
who will be able to add it what right I

00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:54,820
mean a Content layout can be defined by

00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:56,920
the administrator can be defined by the

00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:59,380
client themselves can be defined per

00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:02,410
certain user role so the definition of

00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:04,120
what is static and what the user can

00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:08,590
adapt this is a quite important one to

00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:10,510
take yeah so the other question is also

00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:15,670
how much do you trust your client with

00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:18,880
editing access so you can give you end

00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:20,740
up with huge images that are five Meg's

00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:22,450
and five thousand pixels wide but it's

00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:25,780
like she scaled down to 300 pixel and

00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:27,370
looks like a thumbnail and which is not

00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:29,770
great and then if you give them to me

00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:32,350
options with the text editor you end up

00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:34,690
getting pink text and Comic Sans and it

00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:36,190
doesn't fit in with your your styling so

00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:38,590
when you're building with things that's

00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:40,600
keeping in mind obviously giving the

00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:42,250
kind a certain amount of accessibility

00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:44,470
to be able to do what they would like to

00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:47,530
do but then at the same time keep a bit

00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:50,530
of control over what's going on that's

00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:52,210
really important all right so I think

00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:54,520
that's enough for the introduction let's

00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:57,460
take a look at what we actually can do

00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:59,800
and first of all we're gonna have some

00:09:57,460 --> 00:10:01,270
overview pages the cyclists and the

00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:08,590
routes and what we're going to use for

00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:19,150
them so we've got routes we've got some

00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:21,940
listing pages to put on these pages at

00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:25,060
the top was they had a sort of section

00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:30,520
intro with the image and a little bit of

00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:32,560
intro text so for this just as a sort of

00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:34,150
a bit of a sidestep here just generally

00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:36,190
about blocks what's new in Drupal 8

00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:37,750
although I must say for all of you Keane

00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:39,670
right now I think what I'm about to say

00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:42,220
is lucky change from what Tresor just

00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:44,890
talking about but some things that have

00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:46,570
changed are the fact that site branding

00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:48,580
page title and tabs and a couple of

00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:50,020
other aspects are not actually blocks

00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:53,110
that you place through the block layout

00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:55,030
as opposed to being the template you can

00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:59,110
reuse blocks within the block layout as

00:10:55,030 --> 00:11:01,030
well so this is sort of mini game

00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:01,790
changer but that means really useful so

00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:04,820
you can

00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:07,040
navigation up in the main hit area and

00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:08,720
in the footer and it's the same menu

00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,740
block you don't have to have too many

00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,840
spell reloads

00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:14,540
your navigation up twice so that's

00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:23,510
really really useful then also now menu

00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:26,390
blocks is also part of core so it's what

00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:27,890
you can load up your menu and limited to

00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:31,220
either just the top level or just the

00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:33,590
secondary level and limiter how how deep

00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:35,630
you want there to go then also now we

00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:39,440
have custom block types so you can

00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:41,270
create your own custom block but it's

00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,430
it's not just your standard block with

00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:46,280
description anymore

00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:48,440
and what makes the developers happy is

00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:50,690
that blocks are not plugins so they are

00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:52,790
extensible we can make them configurable

00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:55,370
through the user interface

00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:57,680
they are exportable so we can also

00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:58,840
export the configuration that we when we

00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:01,400
configure a block type for example

00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:04,340
really really important and something

00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:05,810
that me really make that that makes us

00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:07,130
really happy for the rules and

00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:09,200
initiative for example that there's a

00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:11,630
condition API which is abstracting part

00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:13,670
of the pakore which allows us to specify

00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:15,770
visibility conditions for blocks for

00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:19,460
example and any other module could add

00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:22,040
to those conditions and when we take a

00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:25,730
look back at the example that we look at

00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:29,330
so these Heather I mean we can't just do

00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:32,990
that via WYSIWYG or as inky indicated we

00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:35,390
created actually a block a block type

00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:38,200
and that works similar content types so

00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:40,550
we specified okay each each of the

00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:42,200
section header blocks should have a

00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:44,690
banner image should have an introduction

00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:47,480
and the title and that way we can

00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:49,760
maintain a form that all the

00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:52,340
administrators will then for each

00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:53,810
section create a block of that type so

00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:58,880
that it's structured and it doesn't get

00:12:53,810 --> 00:13:00,740
like weird like differently formatted

00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:13,580
for different sections sorry for the

00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:14,510
formatting looks good here confusing the

00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:15,890
waiting between

00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:18,770
things starts getting a little bit of

00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:21,350
sort of jittery and you just have your

00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:22,970
entire site then both on one layout to

00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:26,360
manage it just starts to get a little

00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:27,560
bit too much a couple of the extensions

00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:30,350
that we found recently that have been

00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:32,780
very useful as block access so it works

00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:35,780
very much on the same granularity as

00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:39,350
node access in terms of editing creating

00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:41,720
deleting so if in the case of this if

00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:44,300
you were to create a custom block type

00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:46,070
and you could give your client access to

00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:48,230
just edit the section headers that

00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:49,970
you've created so they can go in and

00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:52,070
through the front-end just go upload a

00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:54,050
new image upload their text well then

00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:56,480
not have the access necessarily to the

00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:57,980
whole block Yui where they can then go

00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:01,460
and shift around what's what and change

00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:04,100
the the context yes so that's very very

00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:06,070
useful extension onto blocks then the

00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:11,330
other one is the block visibility groups

00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:14,870
and so for that of training a moment but

00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:16,730
for cyclist sitter we've used a very

00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:19,490
standard block placement for the

00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:21,140
condition so it's just arm for cyclists

00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:24,020
and then also on four slash user so that

00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:26,270
head also appears on user profiles so

00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:27,950
for this you can only at the moment for

00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:29,960
a block for each instance that you're

00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:33,620
using it you can only use one condition

00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:35,900
at a time but then we now have block

00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:38,360
visibility groups so as the name

00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:40,790
suggests it is a it just groups the

00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:44,630
conditions so in the case for our routes

00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:47,750
we hadn't added on yet for this demo

00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:49,550
site so for us to then go and add ford

00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:52,370
slash routes and then forward slash

00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:54,260
rubes food slash wildcard we didn't have

00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:56,510
that path auto automatically generated

00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:58,370
so using block visibility groups we can

00:14:56,510 --> 00:15:01,190
say that the content type is route and

00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:02,780
the path is also forward slash route so

00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:05,960
that we've got that section header on

00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:08,150
our listing page and on the nodes so

00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:10,270
yeah block visibility groups very very

00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:10,270
useful

00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:18,170
all right so we've talked about the

00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:20,660
overview what about the so we're gonna

00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:23,420
talk first about an actual or content

00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:25,550
implementation comparing WYSIWYG and

00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:27,290
paragraphs so paragraphs like the new

00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:30,260
kid on the block finally having

00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:32,480
multilingual support in Drupal 8 so

00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:34,790
that's like the main reason why we

00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:39,320
didn't use it in Drupal 7 because it's

00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:42,190
not multilingual compatible fully so

00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:45,980
this beautiful route description and

00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:48,110
basically contains off okay people can

00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:50,930
upload the images of what routes they

00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:53,210
have been taken they feeling some base

00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:54,650
data and then we want to have them tell

00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:56,060
us the story right I mean they're all

00:15:54,650 --> 00:16:08,870
just like really I have accomplished

00:15:56,060 --> 00:16:10,850
something I cycled 70 kilometers yeah so

00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:13,460
we can see one of the options is

00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:15,589
obviously WYSIWYG the CK editor that is

00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:19,400
now part of Drupal core you can also add

00:16:15,589 --> 00:16:21,320
another editor what it does is as we can

00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:24,200
see on the left side we enter the base

00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:27,170
information but then we can use this

00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:29,029
WYSIWYG a field that by default is a bit

00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:32,390
small but you can make it a lot bigger

00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:34,459
and people just enter the contents they

00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:35,990
can use any formatting that you allow

00:16:34,459 --> 00:16:38,480
them so on this side

00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:43,990
we allowed them to use comic census

00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:43,990
forms which makes it much more pleasant

00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:51,380
yeah so and that's a bit open area of

00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:53,690
obviously so from my perspective using

00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:56,000
only with the week has it advantageous

00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:58,790
so we can copy and paste long-form

00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,860
content for example so we can just an

00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:02,540
editor that is used to using word

00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:05,329
processor which just copy and paste it

00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:08,660
over and has it almost as formatted as

00:17:05,329 --> 00:17:10,970
as it was but on the other hand it's one

00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:12,949
big chunk of HTML and can get messy

00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:15,350
especially when it comes to alignment

00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:17,390
and special format things so it's not

00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:19,610
something very structured something that

00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:21,860
we have been using a lot in triple7 are

00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:23,689
the ckeditor templates so those are like

00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:24,680
templates that you wire button can

00:17:23,689 --> 00:17:26,510
insert to

00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:30,470
kind of give the editor and more

00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:33,320
advanced markup being generated for

00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:36,770
example like image and then some text on

00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:38,180
the side we try to limit with you make

00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:41,900
as much as possible for triple-eight

00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:43,550
because of the following situation so

00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:45,410
we've been using paragraphs quite a lot

00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:47,480
and quite a few of our projects recently

00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:49,160
and one of the things going back to

00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:51,260
comment about how much access do you

00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:52,760
give your client one of the solutions to

00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:55,130
that is to use as many fields as

00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:56,990
possible to load our content

00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:59,660
specifically so that you can manage your

00:17:56,990 --> 00:18:02,300
your content in your layouts through

00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:05,240
your side and not giving you too much

00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:07,490
freedom and then also using fields

00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:10,520
especially for image uploads that the

00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:12,170
Drupal side and image styles they manage

00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:14,990
the images and don't get that 5 make

00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:17,120
5,000 pixel wide image so for paragraphs

00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:20,240
these are sections of structured content

00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:22,910
which you can create 18 different types

00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:24,410
that are on your site so they and

00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:27,620
they're all loud options so you could

00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:30,170
have one paragraph style which is a text

00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:32,750
and media and then another paragraph

00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:35,420
style which is a large image section

00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:36,920
header that just has title over it that

00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:39,410
you can then go and add parallax or

00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:42,440
something on to it and then with this

00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:44,060
you can use for each four on the content

00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:46,430
type itself so in this case on the

00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:48,650
routes you create one field for a

00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:50,780
paragraph content and then within that

00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:53,360
you load up as many options of paragraph

00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:55,310
styles that you've created so for this

00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,900
we just created two one being a section

00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:59,120
of sort of a little bit of story about a

00:18:56,900 --> 00:19:00,740
segment of the route and then the

00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:02,750
general text in media which is a bit of

00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:07,430
a blah blah about the route itself and

00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:12,470
you can use multiple instances of

00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:13,640
paragraphs very easy to reorder so it's

00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:15,170
kind of a little bit like filled

00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:18,050
collections but this is now part of the

00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:20,000
node not a separate entity and you can

00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:22,190
also nest the paragraphs down to two

00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,020
levels so if you have your text in media

00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:26,480
you can have your text area which is

00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:28,340
just the text and maybe a title in front

00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:31,340
of it then you have your set your second

00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:32,780
paragraph field which then can you can

00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:35,540
choose whether you want to load up an

00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:37,240
image or a video or something else so

00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:39,429
you can go down to levels

00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:42,309
and then those can then be reused in

00:19:39,429 --> 00:19:44,500
other paragraphs or as a paragraph sort

00:19:42,309 --> 00:19:46,059
of by itself at a higher level so you've

00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:47,980
got quite a bit of flexibility in how

00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:50,559
you load them in which case you only

00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:53,260
leave one template for that and also

00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:54,789
paragraphs are integrated interviews so

00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:58,020
it makes quite easy to be able to pull

00:19:54,789 --> 00:20:00,640
things through separately if you want to

00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:02,980
let's maybe take a look a quick look at

00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:05,260
the actual implementation how it how it

00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:07,450
feels like on the wheel side so this is

00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:09,460
the tablet in cycling demo populated

00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:13,200
with some exciting content that we

00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:15,820
filled in so when we go into the routes

00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:18,580
as we have explained initially so we

00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:21,120
have two section header on top and then

00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:24,460
we have a listing of those routes and

00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:26,409
around the mountain with coffee should

00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:30,899
be the one that's based on wait a week

00:20:26,409 --> 00:20:33,610
with what the Comic Sans

00:20:30,899 --> 00:20:36,549
so yeah it's standard Drupal 8 editing

00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:39,909
and we didn't really customize the

00:20:36,549 --> 00:20:41,950
WYSIWYG editor a lot but we can see we

00:20:39,909 --> 00:20:45,669
have allowed full HTML that's very

00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:47,320
permissive that's like the the editing

00:20:45,669 --> 00:20:51,549
experience that a lot of clients will

00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:55,390
ask for I guess so they can do a lot but

00:20:51,549 --> 00:20:57,990
it's also like yeah just danger what can

00:20:55,390 --> 00:21:02,460
happen if you give them so much powers

00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:02,460
on the other hand side when we go back

00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:22,950
we go on edit here I think is gonna tell

00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:22,950
you section and just use the paragraphs

00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:30,880
the text media so this is just a save

00:21:28,299 --> 00:21:34,299
but your your title field story and the

00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:36,730
new image and I have included here sort

00:21:34,299 --> 00:21:37,830
of a left and right placement and chat

00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:42,070
about the later when we get into

00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:44,440
mentioned templates and then down here

00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:46,990
I've loaded up a number of sections and

00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:47,900
the sections also again have a title

00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:52,760
have a dist

00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:54,590
got a grading and a story and so this I

00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:55,940
say you can easily move them around so

00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:58,910
if I decide actually hang on I want to

00:21:55,940 --> 00:22:03,200
ship that over those just sort of pop

00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:05,390
around and so it makes for quite a more

00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:07,310
rich way for someone to bail load a lot

00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:09,320
of interesting content but to be able to

00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:12,830
give them various options and slightly

00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:14,840
more structured way to load up and we

00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:17,120
can see when the editor now wants to add

00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:18,890
content he can choose from the different

00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:21,680
paragraph types that are available as

00:22:18,890 --> 00:22:23,630
terms of I create a section now or I

00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:28,040
create some text in media or I would

00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:30,230
want to add a gallery and you can really

00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:32,360
administer them as you can administer

00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:37,940
content types it's basically the same

00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:41,240
thing cool alright so that was the first

00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:43,190
section so cyclists okay we're gonna

00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:48,350
have a look at this place we'd versus

00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:50,570
context these are the user profiles and

00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:57,100
on the profiles we've got a little bit

00:22:50,570 --> 00:23:00,110
of information about then we've also

00:22:57,100 --> 00:23:01,430
using paragraphs we've got a section to

00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:03,950
be able to add some little bit by

00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:07,460
ography story about oneself and then

00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:09,140
also an entity reference to the clubs

00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:11,570
that are created to be able to say what

00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:12,890
clubs you've got and then also on the

00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:14,780
profiles we want to be able to display

00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:19,430
the bicycles that you've loaded as a

00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:21,560
separate content you can see already

00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:24,290
there's like in terms of layout there's

00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:27,170
the image next to some base data and

00:23:24,290 --> 00:23:29,390
then we have this in the sidebar so as

00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:30,860
we don't know CSS

00:23:29,390 --> 00:23:33,050
we kind of have to have to come up with

00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:35,420
the solution how to structure that

00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:37,250
content or even if we knew CSS we have

00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:38,960
to first group the items so that they

00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:42,790
can be laid out in the way that we see

00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:45,320
it so the first step that we take is

00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:48,350
using display suite and what display

00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:51,500
suite basically does it Hans's the

00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:54,400
display of any entity so that can be of

00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:57,410
content like nodes it can you can also

00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:59,570
put this place weight on top of users or

00:23:57,410 --> 00:24:01,770
it could also use it for paragraphs as

00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:03,780
Enki has been using it

00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:05,760
this place weed supports the lair

00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:08,820
plug-in which was temporarily in courts

00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:12,600
it's a separate module that defines like

00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:14,040
you can describe a layout in terms of

00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:15,840
which are the regions that the layouts

00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:23,360
depends on and then the layout can also

00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:23,360
add some CSS so when we jump into here

00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:31,940
let's go back so we're talking about the

00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:37,140
cyclists which is a separate section and

00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:40,020
those are basically users so I can go to

00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:43,680
inky for example like look at your

00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:45,480
cyclist profile and we see it's

00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:49,020
basically as we've shown it ended in

00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:51,390
this creature something that's nice is

00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:53,520
that when you add the display suite

00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:55,680
module it adds this kind of manage

00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:57,510
display tab directly to the content that

00:24:55,680 --> 00:25:00,480
you're viewing so you don't have to know

00:24:57,510 --> 00:25:01,890
where to go to into the backend so when

00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:05,340
I click on manage display

00:25:01,890 --> 00:25:09,260
I'll get redirected into the manage

00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:16,230
display of the the people configuration

00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:18,870
so when this play suite is activated it

00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:20,960
will allow you to switch to select from

00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:23,520
one of the layouts and these layouts are

00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:24,990
provided by default by display suite but

00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:27,000
there's also extension modules that

00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:28,640
provide additional layouts or you can

00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,800
define your own layouts in your theme

00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:35,040
which is pretty awesome and then when

00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:37,410
you activate that on the upper side it

00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:39,660
just works very similar to managing

00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:41,520
fields normally but you can now switch

00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:44,460
them around between the regions that you

00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:45,990
have predefined so I have two picture on

00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:49,110
the Left I have some information on the

00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:52,380
right so that's pretty awesome already

00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:54,420
to kind of layout content itself but in

00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:57,150
order to pull in additional information

00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:59,160
we also have two cyclists clubs and the

00:25:57,150 --> 00:26:02,520
cyclist clubs is a listing of all the

00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:03,900
clubs that the cyclist pertains to and

00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:05,340
that's something that usually would

00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:07,860
place like a some additional block

00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:10,050
somewhere outside but here we decided we

00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:12,990
want this to be part of the content

00:26:10,050 --> 00:26:14,940
because I don't know the cyclists the

00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:18,599
club just belongs to the content

00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:21,299
of visual representation in order to do

00:26:18,599 --> 00:26:25,349
that something interesting that we have

00:26:21,299 --> 00:26:27,629
found is that in display suite you can

00:26:25,349 --> 00:26:31,049
also define so-called display switch

00:26:27,629 --> 00:26:34,830
fields and one of the field types is a

00:26:31,049 --> 00:26:38,190
block field so basically I can define a

00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:40,499
block to be available as a field on the

00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:42,090
know or on the user in that case that's

00:26:40,499 --> 00:26:44,549
really really interesting that we now

00:26:42,090 --> 00:26:48,539
can also place blocks into the content

00:26:44,549 --> 00:26:50,669
found it really helpful so when I go

00:26:48,539 --> 00:26:53,489
back to the example we can see those

00:26:50,669 --> 00:26:58,289
cyclist clubs they are actually part of

00:26:53,489 --> 00:27:02,970
the rendered entity you want to continue

00:26:58,289 --> 00:27:07,590
with context that we used for this was

00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:09,349
putting the the sidebar using context it

00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:11,549
ended up being sort of fairly simple

00:27:09,349 --> 00:27:14,220
fairly basic compared to what I've

00:27:11,549 --> 00:27:15,479
actually been planning to do and it's

00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:17,759
the first time I've really been able to

00:27:15,479 --> 00:27:21,869
play with context since it came out in

00:27:17,759 --> 00:27:25,159
Drupal 8 so the the concept for this was

00:27:21,869 --> 00:27:27,690
to generate the sort of biography is

00:27:25,159 --> 00:27:29,340
it's a field on the user's but it's not

00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:31,169
being displayed as part of the content

00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:33,450
it's being put out in a views block in

00:27:31,169 --> 00:27:34,859
sidebar so that's where with using

00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:37,229
paragraphs and views that's been

00:27:34,859 --> 00:27:39,419
generated through that and so that block

00:27:37,229 --> 00:27:41,039
it is just being placed and this you

00:27:39,419 --> 00:27:46,190
could use just the stand block layout

00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:49,609
it's the condition is the user and then

00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:53,099
very similar to context in Drupal 7

00:27:49,609 --> 00:27:55,710
you've got it loaded up into the into

00:27:53,099 --> 00:27:57,179
the sidebar the thing that I came across

00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:58,499
that with this though and I'm not sure

00:27:57,179 --> 00:28:02,309
whether it's bike we haven't quite had

00:27:58,499 --> 00:28:03,929
time to look into further yet is that I

00:28:02,309 --> 00:28:06,419
found that as soon as I loaded up the

00:28:03,929 --> 00:28:08,729
context all that other blocks that are

00:28:06,419 --> 00:28:11,609
loaded through the blocks Yui those

00:28:08,729 --> 00:28:13,320
weren't working now on that context so I

00:28:11,609 --> 00:28:15,659
ended up having to create a general site

00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:16,919
layout as an additional context which

00:28:15,659 --> 00:28:18,840
basically is a place on the same

00:28:16,919 --> 00:28:21,119
condition and that's loading up

00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:24,539
everything else so I'm not quite sure

00:28:21,119 --> 00:28:26,099
yet as to what the plan is with that

00:28:24,539 --> 00:28:27,170
whether it is just I was doing something

00:28:26,099 --> 00:28:29,060
wrong but

00:28:27,170 --> 00:28:30,470
something that we picked up a long

00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:31,820
process so it might be that if you

00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:33,890
started using context you have to use

00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:43,610
context for all your block layouts

00:28:33,890 --> 00:28:45,740
throughout the site so yeah so context

00:28:43,610 --> 00:28:47,210
as it is at the moment it is pretty much

00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:49,700
the same as it was in Drupal 7 and

00:28:47,210 --> 00:28:51,560
nothing new some huge things at the

00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:53,180
moment there are a few conditions based

00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:54,830
on conditions API it's very similar to

00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:57,050
what you've got in blocks block

00:28:54,830 --> 00:29:00,140
visibility groups those also work in

00:28:57,050 --> 00:29:02,330
context as a as a condition so I think

00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:04,610
it's still fairly early days for it but

00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:06,560
it's coming it'll be similar to what it

00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:09,430
was and then with everything else that

00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:09,430
Drupal 8 has to offer

00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:17,720
context it's not that all right so we we

00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:20,330
saw two examples for overviews let's

00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:22,580
take a look at even more so we want to

00:29:20,330 --> 00:29:26,090
compare parallels with views for the

00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:29,540
upcoming sections so it's again the same

00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:30,800
story we have the section header but

00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:35,510
just that we implement it a bit

00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:37,340
differently so panels and so I've heard

00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:40,040
a lot of people are familiar with the

00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:42,340
panel's module but if you aren't just be

00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:46,280
aware it's quite it's quite a big thing

00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:49,130
and that's for a good reason so what you

00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:51,530
can see here is that similarly as we

00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:53,420
would any layout think to like an

00:29:51,530 --> 00:29:56,630
organize stuff so it works pretty

00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:59,030
similar as the block placement but it

00:29:56,630 --> 00:30:01,210
does it in this whole container of

00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:03,590
functionality the panel provides us with

00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:06,800
so if you're looking into any of those

00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:09,590
features like access conditions so you

00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:11,600
can define together with page manager

00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:13,520
which is separate module you can define

00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:15,440
that this landing page this overview

00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:17,330
page is only accessible for users of

00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:19,400
that certain role so that's a

00:30:17,330 --> 00:30:22,010
functionality provides and then you can

00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:24,470
also define different variants so you

00:30:22,010 --> 00:30:26,150
could say the the page should have a

00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:28,220
different layout for this kind of user

00:30:26,150 --> 00:30:30,640
it should have a totally different

00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:33,980
variant and I'm based under certain

00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:36,680
condition circumstances which is which

00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:40,790
is quite nice trick that we've been

00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:42,680
using a lot in Drupal 7 then

00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:44,330
we can select the layout so they are

00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:46,310
inter compatible so layouts that are

00:30:44,330 --> 00:30:50,540
compatible with this place we will also

00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:53,270
be compatible with with panels so that's

00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:55,520
kind of the big suite that we using and

00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:58,130
then there's something named context and

00:30:55,520 --> 00:31:00,530
every time we talk about context we have

00:30:58,130 --> 00:31:03,740
to we have to fight with that name

00:31:00,530 --> 00:31:05,720
conflict so the context here or the

00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:07,820
context API that also has been

00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:09,650
integrated in triple-core now this is

00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:11,840
more like a system that allows us to

00:31:09,650 --> 00:31:14,900
describe contextual arguments that are

00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:16,400
passed for example the page knows about

00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:18,710
the current user being logged in and

00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:22,760
that user object will then be passed on

00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:24,290
to the panel I can so we can also make

00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:26,900
for example relationships between

00:31:24,290 --> 00:31:29,300
context I could determine from the user

00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:31,100
I could determine our note reference for

00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:33,620
example and pass that note being

00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:35,690
referenced on to and that makes for a

00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:37,130
really powerful system later on for

00:31:35,690 --> 00:31:39,620
people that think in object-oriented

00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:41,300
ways they can really turn this into the

00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:43,940
site onto the site building level and

00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:46,940
configure a context for example for a

00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:48,980
certain block I want a block to be

00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:53,630
configured with the user so that I show

00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:55,310
just to use a teaser for example so this

00:31:53,630 --> 00:31:58,820
system is still in the works like not

00:31:55,310 --> 00:32:01,040
all the UIs are available but panels per

00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:16,880
se is pretty stable and can already be

00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:19,370
used but nowadays it's getting more than

00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:21,230
just the text area you and the result

00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:23,210
something that's always been there and

00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:25,040
then obviously in the text area being

00:32:23,210 --> 00:32:27,170
able to pull through any of replacement

00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:30,110
patterns from the content itself on that

00:32:27,170 --> 00:32:33,650
page but in the view area now you can

00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:36,020
also embed another view which can be

00:32:33,650 --> 00:32:38,140
interesting depending what you're trying

00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:40,310
to do and then also rendered entity

00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:42,290
something that's not available to put in

00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:44,630
a header which means that you can

00:32:42,290 --> 00:32:47,750
actually load a block so in our case we

00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:50,540
could then create a block based of our

00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:53,549
custom block type with our image and

00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:55,739
intro text and on a specific

00:32:53,549 --> 00:32:59,340
age then load through that actual block

00:32:55,739 --> 00:33:01,230
to be in that hit area so it's using

00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:04,460
things just in different yeah slightly

00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:07,200
different way same same content I think

00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:08,700
like I almost forgot that the

00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:11,399
functionality exists in viewers because

00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:13,619
I'm so used to using panels and stuff

00:33:11,399 --> 00:33:14,970
but if you don't want to depend on any

00:33:13,619 --> 00:33:16,499
of these modules this comes for free

00:33:14,970 --> 00:33:17,940
with Drupal core you can always add some

00:33:16,499 --> 00:33:20,159
stuff to the header or to the footer

00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:23,820
build that kind of simple layout

00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:25,440
you know we triple core functionality so

00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:28,590
we want to talk about the final context

00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:30,210
content section which are the clubs so

00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:32,690
we've seen the routes we've seen the

00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:35,070
cyclists and they together are in clubs

00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:41,720
what we're going to look at is panelizer

00:33:35,070 --> 00:33:41,720
and tweaked templates so for the club's

00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:50,519
pretty basic type of content you've got

00:33:46,379 --> 00:33:52,710
your location and and in a story about

00:33:50,519 --> 00:33:54,779
the club itself and then through link

00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:56,369
through that one can then extend on

00:33:54,779 --> 00:34:01,980
other blocks that can get pulled through

00:33:56,369 --> 00:34:03,809
of who's a member of that Club and what

00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:12,270
packs are part of that we didn't build

00:34:03,809 --> 00:34:14,220
though to the great degree so let's jump

00:34:12,270 --> 00:34:19,470
into our site again to take a look at it

00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:22,950
and so what what's really exciting for

00:34:19,470 --> 00:34:24,869
me is just like the way it starts so

00:34:22,950 --> 00:34:30,059
when I go to structure content types

00:34:24,869 --> 00:34:33,839
club usually panelizer as in Drupal

00:34:30,059 --> 00:34:37,980
server and it integrates into the manage

00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:40,319
display whipser and immediately we can

00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:42,059
see a difference now because we triple7

00:34:40,319 --> 00:34:44,369
we would still see the manage display in

00:34:42,059 --> 00:34:47,099
terms of having all the fields and just

00:34:44,369 --> 00:34:49,169
a checkbox and it just happens a lot

00:34:47,099 --> 00:34:50,579
that people start to reorder the fields

00:34:49,169 --> 00:34:54,450
and then they find out it doesn't work

00:34:50,579 --> 00:34:56,010
and so a very nice small improvement for

00:34:54,450 --> 00:34:58,740
to pallate is that as soon as you

00:34:56,010 --> 00:35:01,230
penalize the view boat and this is how

00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:06,349
it gets activated so in order to use

00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:08,869
panelizer i just enable it and I can

00:35:06,349 --> 00:35:11,509
so enable a setting called allow custom

00:35:08,869 --> 00:35:14,930
overrides for each entity and that

00:35:11,509 --> 00:35:18,410
that's kind of enabling analyzer also

00:35:14,930 --> 00:35:21,039
penalizing Drupal 8 works based on the

00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:23,299
panel's IPE that's the in-place editor

00:35:21,039 --> 00:35:28,549
and we're gonna find out how it looks

00:35:23,299 --> 00:35:32,479
like just in a second so let's go to the

00:35:28,549 --> 00:35:35,479
home page I never used that practice I'd

00:35:32,479 --> 00:35:39,619
put but usability experts have found out

00:35:35,479 --> 00:35:43,190
it's really important so we are with the

00:35:39,619 --> 00:35:45,319
clips and let's take a look at one of

00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:49,069
these clubs so the Cape Town nuts

00:35:45,319 --> 00:35:51,369
writers as we look at it it's pretty

00:35:49,069 --> 00:35:53,720
basic it doesn't have much information

00:35:51,369 --> 00:35:55,579
but we can see on the bottom is the

00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:57,349
in-place editing functionality that is

00:35:55,579 --> 00:36:01,160
now also stable and available for tuple

00:35:57,349 --> 00:36:03,440
8 so in-place editing kind of similar to

00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:06,289
what Greece's vision is what we have

00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:07,489
talked about today outside in so I want

00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:09,319
to look at something and I want to be

00:36:07,489 --> 00:36:11,420
able to change it this is what we can do

00:36:09,319 --> 00:36:13,849
here with the in-place editing so I'm at

00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:15,650
the content I can change the layout so I

00:36:13,849 --> 00:36:18,890
can choose from the same layouts that

00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:22,460
are available in the back cam maybe make

00:36:18,890 --> 00:36:25,279
a brick set up and update it right away

00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:28,219
here and boom we are in the in-place

00:36:25,279 --> 00:36:30,440
editing and that basically allows us to

00:36:28,219 --> 00:36:36,979
drag and drop around like a WYSIWYG

00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:39,219
manner the different fields save it and

00:36:36,979 --> 00:36:41,749
now when I save it I can choose between

00:36:39,219 --> 00:36:43,940
saving as default which would be the

00:36:41,749 --> 00:36:47,359
global template the panelizer provides

00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:49,940
or it would be a custom override of that

00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:54,619
specific entity so let's do a customer

00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:57,259
right so if we see some reordering where

00:36:54,619 --> 00:37:02,269
the image is on the right and when we go

00:36:57,259 --> 00:37:06,200
back to another club this other club is

00:37:02,269 --> 00:37:10,579
not affected this other Club is also

00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:12,920
overridden as I can see and then

00:37:10,579 --> 00:37:15,229
whichever club I have like with the

00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:17,960
specific panelist override I can revert

00:37:15,229 --> 00:37:21,039
it to the global layout so it's pretty

00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:21,039
nice also when you edit

00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:26,210
or so when you edit you can rearrange

00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:28,220
and when you manage content you can add

00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:30,830
additional stuff and all of these

00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:34,180
additional stuff can be like blocks it

00:37:30,830 --> 00:37:38,240
can be so you have to enable see tools

00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:42,200
some see tool sub module for all the

00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:44,540
fields to be available and so forth so

00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:46,030
yeah it's it's a pretty extensible

00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:48,020
system that is really powerful

00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:49,640
definitely worth checking out if you

00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:57,110
want that complexity and all of that

00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:58,580
functionality available so the last

00:37:57,110 --> 00:38:00,410
thing we want to mention is to tweak

00:37:58,580 --> 00:38:03,370
templates and this is usually something

00:38:00,410 --> 00:38:05,930
that we hand over to other team members

00:38:03,370 --> 00:38:08,720
because we're just not good in inviting

00:38:05,930 --> 00:38:10,310
markup but the way that for example a

00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:11,870
site builder would work together with

00:38:10,310 --> 00:38:14,300
the themer is that the site pool that

00:38:11,870 --> 00:38:16,940
would already pre create such a quick

00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:20,000
template and the tweak template by

00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:21,950
default comes with only print content so

00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,270
this is the statement that prints

00:38:21,950 --> 00:38:25,820
something and it would only print

00:38:23,270 --> 00:38:28,760
content like everything that is in the

00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:31,400
content but this way while building the

00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:33,560
fields in the back end like configuring

00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:35,660
which fields are available when I then I

00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:37,820
immediately add them to its own template

00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:39,530
and then the front end person can

00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:41,720
rearrange those fields into the

00:38:39,530 --> 00:38:57,290
appropriate regions for example and have

00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:58,970
full control over the markup out of it

00:38:57,290 --> 00:39:01,570
and there's a lot that one can do in

00:38:58,970 --> 00:39:06,500
rewriting with the tweak templates

00:39:01,570 --> 00:39:08,960
including stripping out you can strip

00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:11,090
out all the defaults Drupal markup that

00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:13,070
comes with it so that you can just

00:39:11,090 --> 00:39:15,650
rewrite some really simple

00:39:13,070 --> 00:39:20,300
straightforward templates with very very

00:39:15,650 --> 00:39:22,970
clean there's also the override system

00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:25,130
for the template so something that not

00:39:22,970 --> 00:39:27,410
so easily achievable with site building

00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:29,840
tools here can really easily do it you

00:39:27,410 --> 00:39:31,100
can have a suggestion that says okay

00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:32,160
there's a generic template and no

00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:34,890
template and then

00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:36,870
based on a suggestion like the note type

00:39:34,890 --> 00:39:39,270
I can have a specific template for the

00:39:36,870 --> 00:39:41,580
article or more specific template for

00:39:39,270 --> 00:39:44,160
the article teaser and so forth so

00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:45,930
there's a lot of full control available

00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:49,230
when you use or when you go into Twitter

00:39:45,930 --> 00:40:08,160
template which is by the way from site

00:39:49,230 --> 00:40:09,720
building but still a good option so this

00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:12,630
is local search we've been working on

00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:14,070
this in the Cape Town office we've just

00:40:12,630 --> 00:40:19,740
done a reader launcher of this in a

00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:21,930
couple of weeks ago this page is a great

00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:23,610
example so this site we both generally

00:40:21,930 --> 00:40:26,850
using paragraphs I think we've got about

00:40:23,610 --> 00:40:30,840
20 different paragraph types on the site

00:40:26,850 --> 00:40:36,420
and of that about five or six owned used

00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:38,670
as sub or nested paragraphs for this

00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:40,980
page this is basic information page this

00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:43,200
top section here with the image we make

00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:44,730
a company visible and then button that

00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:47,340
is all just the basic part of the node

00:40:44,730 --> 00:40:51,510
and everything else is part of a

00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:54,270
paragraph so here this one here is this

00:40:51,510 --> 00:40:57,480
highlights row this we've got each of

00:40:54,270 --> 00:40:59,430
these items is a sub paragraph which is

00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:01,290
then grouped into a bigger one

00:40:59,430 --> 00:41:04,290
it's a vinter row so you can add

00:41:01,290 --> 00:41:07,260
multiple of these items within that

00:41:04,290 --> 00:41:09,650
paragraph row and then something here

00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:11,820
that we've been doing quite a bit of is

00:41:09,650 --> 00:41:14,400
providing a checkbox to be able to say

00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:15,840
whether you want a gray or white

00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:18,690
background whether you want the image

00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:20,700
floated left or right and that's the the

00:41:18,690 --> 00:41:23,070
left or right that option is then added

00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:25,170
as a class on the trick template just be

00:41:23,070 --> 00:41:28,710
able to theme that in very simple way so

00:41:25,170 --> 00:41:30,420
that these two rows here are actually

00:41:28,710 --> 00:41:33,000
the same paragraph just with different

00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:34,800
options set and then this down here is

00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,270
the same thing just a basic left and

00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:40,470
right that's written out into the

00:41:36,270 --> 00:41:42,810
template yeah and then goes down to 40

00:41:40,470 --> 00:41:44,190
and stuff but this is an example as I

00:41:42,810 --> 00:41:45,509
said with about 20 different types

00:41:44,190 --> 00:41:48,869
paragraphs

00:41:45,509 --> 00:41:54,209
the whole sizes both on that and that

00:41:48,869 --> 00:42:10,109
and general blocks like a similar

00:41:54,209 --> 00:42:11,999
example switch browsers would be the

00:42:10,109 --> 00:42:13,919
iMac fleet portal so it's also mainly

00:42:11,999 --> 00:42:15,539
paste and para based on paragraphs where

00:42:13,919 --> 00:42:17,909
there's different options so for each

00:42:15,539 --> 00:42:19,889
paragraph I can choose if it should be a

00:42:17,909 --> 00:42:22,139
big one

00:42:19,889 --> 00:42:25,589
if like can choose from different

00:42:22,139 --> 00:42:27,419
categories to be highlighted I can even

00:42:25,589 --> 00:42:29,849
choose like additional layouts options

00:42:27,419 --> 00:42:31,649
and here we chose to two separate

00:42:29,849 --> 00:42:34,469
content from presentation so the

00:42:31,649 --> 00:42:35,880
paragraphs themselves are about the

00:42:34,469 --> 00:42:38,549
presentation logic like about the

00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:40,799
layouts and they reference teasers that

00:42:38,549 --> 00:42:43,519
are pulled from from another content

00:42:40,799 --> 00:42:46,019
type so that way we can maintain the

00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:48,839
information and it's in one content type

00:42:46,019 --> 00:42:51,079
and that layouting of it is in the

00:42:48,839 --> 00:42:54,739
paragraphs for example so that we still

00:42:51,079 --> 00:42:54,739
separate those concerns

00:43:00,650 --> 00:43:14,810
yes so yeah so multilingual for amazing

00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:17,660
lab Zurich being Switzerland having four

00:43:14,810 --> 00:43:19,250
official languages and came from South

00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:21,710
Africa where we have 11 official

00:43:19,250 --> 00:43:23,450
languages multilingual is quite an

00:43:21,710 --> 00:43:28,700
important aspect for us in all the sides

00:43:23,450 --> 00:43:30,350
that we build so yeah definitely so

00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:32,390
that's also the reason why I mentioned

00:43:30,350 --> 00:43:35,060
for example paragraphs was difficult to

00:43:32,390 --> 00:43:37,340
choose so usually most of the

00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:39,260
translation will happen on the content

00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:41,990
levels so for example a clock can be

00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:44,660
translated like content the the pages

00:43:41,990 --> 00:43:46,280
can be translated but keep in mind like

00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:47,840
if you use something like the views

00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:49,700
approach where with the views header

00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:52,160
that might leave that in configuration

00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:53,510
which the cont that the translator has

00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:57,770
to find in a different translation

00:43:53,510 --> 00:43:59,570
interface and for paragraphs so or in

00:43:57,770 --> 00:44:02,510
general when we talk about translations

00:43:59,570 --> 00:44:04,160
and layouts the question usually is dear

00:44:02,510 --> 00:44:05,990
client do you want to have the same

00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:07,220
layout on all the languages or do you

00:44:05,990 --> 00:44:08,870
want to have a different layout per

00:44:07,220 --> 00:44:11,090
language and if you use the standard

00:44:08,870 --> 00:44:12,590
translation system the paragraphs module

00:44:11,090 --> 00:44:14,660
doesn't allow you to create different

00:44:12,590 --> 00:44:17,180
layouts because what the paragraphs

00:44:14,660 --> 00:44:19,490
module does is it only allows you to

00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:21,140
translate each of the text fields that

00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:23,810
you filled out but you're not able to

00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:26,090
change the structure so we started

00:44:23,810 --> 00:44:28,760
working on a patch and we maintain our

00:44:26,090 --> 00:44:30,920
own branch that so-called outer level

00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:32,510
translation if you want to play around

00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:33,890
with that or if you're interested in bed

00:44:32,510 --> 00:44:35,510
there's a there's an issue in Drupal a

00:44:33,890 --> 00:44:42,680
Doric and there's also a branch or

00:44:35,510 --> 00:44:44,600
github yeah confusion some new features

00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:46,040
on hundred percent use bleed as I

00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:50,350
mentioned with context there seems to be

00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:50,350
a few bugs with everything at the moment

00:44:53,050 --> 00:45:02,240
though next week what happens one of the

00:45:00,260 --> 00:45:04,130
things is to its balance the flexibility

00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:05,630
and consistency across the site so as

00:45:04,130 --> 00:45:08,450
we've mentioned before giving your

00:45:05,630 --> 00:45:09,770
clients a certain amount of access but

00:45:08,450 --> 00:45:10,940
then at the same time not restricting

00:45:09,770 --> 00:45:11,480
them too much that they feel as though

00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:14,780
they've got

00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:17,420
thing that's they actually can't use and

00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:19,790
another thing is that there are a lot of

00:45:17,420 --> 00:45:21,470
options and so it's question of

00:45:19,790 --> 00:45:24,200
considering the goal of what you need to

00:45:21,470 --> 00:45:25,970
achieve and who will be using it so

00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:28,280
whether it will be the site for the

00:45:25,970 --> 00:45:35,650
content manager loading a lot of content

00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:38,480
or the reel using in client I think one

00:45:35,650 --> 00:45:40,609
one thing that I really find important

00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:43,130
is that also you together with your team

00:45:40,609 --> 00:45:44,720
your developers just talk about the

00:45:43,130 --> 00:45:47,270
different opportunity like the different

00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:48,770
possibilities like do we prefer to have

00:45:47,270 --> 00:45:50,420
everything in a template or do we want

00:45:48,770 --> 00:45:52,520
to have everything on the site being

00:45:50,420 --> 00:45:54,260
configured like figuring out that right

00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:55,880
workflow I I don't think there's like

00:45:54,260 --> 00:46:00,590
one suggestion to make but every team

00:45:55,880 --> 00:46:03,140
should find their own best practices and

00:46:00,590 --> 00:46:04,700
yeah Confucius say the life is really

00:46:03,140 --> 00:46:06,800
simple but we insist on making it

00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:10,280
complicated don't do the same to your

00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:13,010
website as I said choose choose one or

00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:14,750
two sets of modules to use for your

00:46:13,010 --> 00:46:16,550
layouts and don't do what we've done on

00:46:14,750 --> 00:46:17,900
our demo site and thrown everything at

00:46:16,550 --> 00:46:20,420
it because I think if we try to actually

00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:24,290
work out how to theme it I think our

00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:28,100
team would be completely with us so just

00:46:24,290 --> 00:46:30,550
keep it simple just kind of and the demo

00:46:28,100 --> 00:46:34,400
site only broke like four or five times

00:46:30,550 --> 00:46:36,109
so that that's yeah thanks a lot for

00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:38,530
attention we're very happy to hear

00:46:36,109 --> 00:46:38,530
questions

00:46:42,750 --> 00:47:01,120
yes so maybe we should repeat a question

00:46:58,930 --> 00:47:02,980
for the fully recording or it could

00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:04,270
somebody bring a microphone oh there's a

00:47:02,980 --> 00:47:05,560
microphone in the center so for the

00:47:04,270 --> 00:47:08,500
following questions please use the

00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:09,940
microphone the question was if there's a

00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:11,470
lot of block types and a lot of

00:47:09,940 --> 00:47:15,210
information gathered into those blocks

00:47:11,470 --> 00:47:15,210
would it be hard for migration later

00:47:22,290 --> 00:47:26,500
especially when it comes to images if

00:47:24,670 --> 00:47:29,580
you are trying to migrate something if

00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:29,580
it is all field-based

00:47:31,740 --> 00:47:36,610
hopefully now with Drupal 8 and the way

00:47:34,090 --> 00:47:45,220
it's going any kind of migration will be

00:47:36,610 --> 00:47:48,700
more straightforward change things

00:47:45,220 --> 00:47:50,950
around one of the great things that kind

00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:54,640
of in views is the fact that you can

00:47:50,950 --> 00:47:56,740
convert a views page interviews block so

00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:59,440
it's not just duplicating the same thing

00:47:56,740 --> 00:48:02,950
as the same type but you can change that

00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:05,110
so based on that kind of initial change

00:48:02,950 --> 00:48:06,610
in Drupal 8 we might find that at a

00:48:05,110 --> 00:48:08,980
later stage maybe something we put

00:48:06,610 --> 00:48:14,860
forward is that maybe you can convert a

00:48:08,980 --> 00:48:16,960
node into a change I think as long as

00:48:14,860 --> 00:48:19,180
it's a structured approach and you know

00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:25,810
why using a node type or content type as

00:48:19,180 --> 00:48:27,670
opposed to a block yeah I would agree

00:48:25,810 --> 00:48:30,490
that if you have it structured it's

00:48:27,670 --> 00:48:32,470
easier to migrate usually because if you

00:48:30,490 --> 00:48:33,640
have something in a blob in a WYSIWYG

00:48:32,470 --> 00:48:35,230
and then you figure out you want to

00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:38,490
split it up then it's always a manual

00:48:35,230 --> 00:48:42,070
process so it gives you more flexibility

00:48:38,490 --> 00:48:43,870
and less hassle but copying a WYSIWYG

00:48:42,070 --> 00:48:46,150
far up field will be simpler than

00:48:43,870 --> 00:48:47,800
copying all the paragraph fields that's

00:48:46,150 --> 00:48:49,810
that's the trade-off that you make I

00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:52,090
think thank you

00:48:49,810 --> 00:48:56,040
another question maybe go to the mic

00:48:52,090 --> 00:48:56,040
yeah it's free

00:48:56,420 --> 00:49:02,130
Thanks is there a reason is there an

00:48:59,310 --> 00:49:10,080
easy way to reuse the content of a

00:49:02,130 --> 00:49:11,520
paragraph in another node so one thing

00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:14,580
that's really important we have made

00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:16,770
that mistake is reusing paragraphs is

00:49:14,580 --> 00:49:19,920
something that is possible but it's it

00:49:16,770 --> 00:49:21,630
you shouldn't do it because paragraphs

00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:24,210
follows the compositional pattern so

00:49:21,630 --> 00:49:26,520
paragraph will always be part of the

00:49:24,210 --> 00:49:28,650
parent node so when you delete a parent

00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:30,600
node whether wherever you have reused

00:49:28,650 --> 00:49:36,180
the paragraph in other places in the

00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:39,800
system will just disappear it's the

00:49:36,180 --> 00:49:43,560
content that can be reused it I figure

00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:46,050
but I already did correct

00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:47,820
so that's that's kind of the trade-off

00:49:46,050 --> 00:49:49,800
you have to make I would strongly

00:49:47,820 --> 00:49:52,740
suggest to use something like blocks or

00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:55,440
something that is its own entity but you

00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:57,540
can like with inline entity form for

00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:59,850
example you could have the paragraph

00:49:57,540 --> 00:50:02,160
just be the placeholder for creating a

00:49:59,850 --> 00:50:04,770
block for example to be able to

00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:07,080
reference it I haven't used it in that

00:50:04,770 --> 00:50:09,900
way but that would be the kind of

00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:12,060
balancing that I would see but it's from

00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:14,700
a usability perspective maybe it's not

00:50:12,060 --> 00:50:17,070
perfect yet but in terms of being able

00:50:14,700 --> 00:50:21,680
to maintain the content and not losing

00:50:17,070 --> 00:50:21,680
content don't reuse Paris

00:50:26,359 --> 00:50:33,680
so paragraphs again so developer I

00:50:30,470 --> 00:50:36,710
really like paragraphs because I have

00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:39,109
all the control on how the page is

00:50:36,710 --> 00:50:40,760
structured and what I can do with what

00:50:39,109 --> 00:50:45,829
is produced in terms of markup and

00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:49,400
everything and I noticed also the the

00:50:45,829 --> 00:50:51,859
the editors kind of like it because it's

00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:54,170
it feels like you know that the page is

00:50:51,859 --> 00:50:57,200
structured from from top to bottom in

00:50:54,170 --> 00:51:03,470
sections and that works well with you

00:50:57,200 --> 00:51:06,319
know a lot of designs but still I wonder

00:51:03,470 --> 00:51:08,539
it's a it's a huge abstraction you know

00:51:06,319 --> 00:51:10,670
it's totally the opposite of the of the

00:51:08,539 --> 00:51:12,349
outside-in thing so you really have to

00:51:10,670 --> 00:51:15,680
think about that as soon as you start

00:51:12,349 --> 00:51:20,119
adding those radio buttons for left and

00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:28,760
right and little things that the

00:51:20,119 --> 00:51:31,069
paragraphs change anyway so the first

00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:34,279
question is how is your experience with

00:51:31,069 --> 00:51:38,410
the clients in this area and what did

00:51:34,279 --> 00:51:38,410
you do to make this a little bit better

00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:48,770
understand the plants I don't think I

00:51:47,180 --> 00:51:51,460
actually had to train him much at all on

00:51:48,770 --> 00:51:54,109
how to use it and load up the content

00:51:51,460 --> 00:51:55,549
when we went through the site we kind of

00:51:54,109 --> 00:51:56,690
explained that this was the way that

00:51:55,549 --> 00:51:59,839
we're going to pull that we give you

00:51:56,690 --> 00:52:01,490
these options of how to do things and he

00:51:59,839 --> 00:52:03,440
went and just populated the site within

00:52:01,490 --> 00:52:06,710
a couple of days and off he went

00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:08,539
they have been a couple of times where

00:52:06,710 --> 00:52:10,069
one of his colleagues has been trying to

00:52:08,539 --> 00:52:11,900
load content and been trying to do

00:52:10,069 --> 00:52:14,299
something different to what the the

00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:15,920
template for each paragraph provides so

00:52:14,299 --> 00:52:17,809
we have had to fiddle a couple of

00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:19,579
paragraphs to make them a little bit

00:52:17,809 --> 00:52:23,270
more flexible to have a different type

00:52:19,579 --> 00:52:25,309
of functionality but that again is with

00:52:23,270 --> 00:52:27,200
that that flexibility that you give the

00:52:25,309 --> 00:52:29,390
client or and the control that you keep

00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:34,309
so there's a bit of a juggle between

00:52:29,390 --> 00:52:37,859
that but yeah it's so far they've people

00:52:34,309 --> 00:52:39,989
haven't haven't had any questions

00:52:37,859 --> 00:52:42,539
editing the content well the one thing

00:52:39,989 --> 00:52:44,789
that we have had to do though is to as

00:52:42,539 --> 00:52:47,130
we've been building and testing each tab

00:52:44,789 --> 00:52:49,739
that we've got is just takes screenshots

00:52:47,130 --> 00:52:53,400
of each one and label it and say you

00:52:49,739 --> 00:52:55,380
know as a kind of a guy user guide as to

00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:58,200
especially for that one with 20

00:52:55,380 --> 00:53:00,029
different types you know the highlights

00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:01,709
row this is what it does this is what it

00:53:00,029 --> 00:53:30,180
should look like this is the purpose for

00:53:01,709 --> 00:53:55,979
it so for me to be able to help I think

00:53:30,180 --> 00:53:58,039
it's yeah I think it's okay we've

00:53:55,979 --> 00:54:04,380
actually also been working on this issue

00:53:58,039 --> 00:54:10,739
there's one of the actually one of my

00:54:04,380 --> 00:54:12,809
colleagues wrote a similar we posted a

00:54:10,739 --> 00:54:22,440
patch like two months ago I'm not sure

00:54:12,809 --> 00:54:24,619
but let's let's take a look thanks

00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:24,619
