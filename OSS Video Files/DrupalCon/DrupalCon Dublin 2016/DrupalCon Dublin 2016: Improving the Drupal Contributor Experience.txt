Title: DrupalCon Dublin 2016: Improving the Drupal Contributor Experience
Publication date: 2016-09-27
Playlist: DrupalCon Dublin 2016
Description: 
	The Drupal Community Working Group (CWG) upholds the Drupal Code of Conduct in order to maintain a friendly and welcoming community for the Drupal project. Since its inception, the CWG has dealt with numerous issues related to contributor frustration and burnout. The Drupal 8 development cycle in particular resulted in an increased number of reported issues that threatened to undermine morale and productivity within the community. The CWG is concerned that if the root causes of these kinds of issues remain unaddressed, they will continue to surface and ultimately result in fewer people who are motivated to contribute to the Drupal project.

This session will explore some of the root causes of contributor frustration and burnout in the community and offer some ideas for how to help improve the contributor experience moving forward. As part of our ongoing efforts to maintain documentation and processes focused on the health of the community, the CWG has spent the last few months conducting research, including a survey and interviews of dozens of Drupal contributors, to better understand the issues that they’ve experienced.   

We will share the results of this research and how it informs our understanding of the problem as well as possible solutions. Some ideas that we will discuss include more formalized mentorship programs, leadership training, better community conflict resolution resources, and more. Instead of focusing on specific technical issues or the behavior of individuals, our goal is to help answer the question, "What can our community do to improve the experience of contributing to Drupal for everyone?" 

Attendees will not only gain insight into the kinds of issues that people experience when contributing to Drupal and other open source projects, but also learn about some important non-technical tools and techniques that can help improve communication and make it easier for people to become more engaged members of our community.

hi there hello and welcome to improving

00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:06,960
the drupal contributor experience this

00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:09,690
is kind of the Drupal community working

00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:12,719
group session I'm George de Matt we have

00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:15,540
my canelo Emma Kerry honest who are also

00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:17,940
from the community working group Adam

00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:21,090
Hills or other member and he

00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:23,490
unfortunately can't be at drupalcon

00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:28,619
Dublin he's back at home with his wife

00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:31,230
expecting a baby like any day now so the

00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:33,570
community working group is a volunteer

00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:36,420
group we are chartered and appointed by

00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:38,040
drees and we promote and uphold the

00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:39,629
Drupal code of conduct in order to

00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:44,040
maintain a friendly and welcoming

00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:46,649
environment for the Drupal project ways

00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:50,219
that we do this we filled incident

00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:54,120
reports you know when when somebody has

00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:56,969
an issue or observes or experiences a

00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:59,520
code of conduct violation or something

00:00:56,969 --> 00:01:04,110
that's just wrong they they file that

00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:06,930
report on a web form on drupal.org so we

00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:09,510
we try to help defuse tense situations

00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:11,360
as can sometimes involve mediating

00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:14,880
and/or arbitrating and particularly

00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:16,710
seemingly intractable disputes we also

00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:20,549
help develop tools and resources to

00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:22,140
promote community health and we work to

00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:23,640
try to recognize leadership in the

00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:25,049
community one way we do this is through

00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,820
the air and wind born award which we

00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:31,430
give out every year at the North

00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:33,780
American drupalcon so as members of the

00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:35,850
Khmer working group we often find

00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:39,299
ourselves in a position where we hear a

00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:41,340
lot about contributor frustrations and

00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:43,409
complaints and you know when you've been

00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:46,619
doing this for long enough you start to

00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:48,750
see some patterns emerge and we feel

00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:52,470
that these patterns are really symptoms

00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:55,590
of some larger structural and cultural

00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:58,590
issues in our community some of the

00:01:55,590 --> 00:02:00,750
things that we see include technical

00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:03,840
disagreements that turn into personal

00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:05,579
attacks often involving people lashing

00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:09,149
out at each other an issue queues around

00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:11,099
the IRC a big thing we've been dealing

00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:11,880
with a lot recently is a frustration

00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:13,710
with the amount of

00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:18,090
that it takes to review patches and

00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:19,980
project applications and you know if we

00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:22,290
don't address these issues some of the

00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:24,350
potential consequences for the Drupal

00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:28,020
project and community would include

00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:31,800
declining contributor morale decline in

00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:34,230
productivity people leaving the project

00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:36,210
we've seen this happen and people

00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:41,460
choosing just not to join the Drupal

00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:43,080
project but in order to really

00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:45,870
understand address these issues we need

00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:49,860
some data unfortunately we do have some

00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:52,320
so back earlier this year drees held a

00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:53,940
state of drupal survey which 2900 people

00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:55,800
responded to one of the questions he

00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:57,390
asked was about the challenges

00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:00,690
frustrations and problems that people

00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:03,870
had with drupal contribution and i know

00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:06,090
this is very very hard to read but the

00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:09,270
two biggest challenge is cited at those

00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:11,760
two bars at the top are the complex

00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:15,000
issue queue and slow consensus building

00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:17,820
and that bugs and patches don't get

00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:21,830
reviewed quickly enough so that's

00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:24,810
followed by you know a variety of other

00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:28,110
you know issues going down people not

00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:31,860
knowing how to contribute complexity of

00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:36,090
the architecture project application

00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:38,180
review process and interesting that you

00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:40,640
go all the way down to other one of the

00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:44,130
lot of the people who answered other

00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:48,440
cited lack of time as an issue which was

00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:50,970
not one of the options in the survey so

00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:52,950
if we summarize the complaints that

00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:55,080
we've heard along with the results of

00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:57,660
trees a survey kind of the big picture

00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:59,550
issue is this right contributing a

00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:01,740
Drupal can be slow complex and

00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:03,570
time-consuming and many people don't

00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:06,390
have the time or the patience to do it

00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:07,920
and I think most folks have been around

00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:09,900
your boat would agree that this is true

00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:12,990
you know and I want to be really clear

00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:15,739
like you know having something be

00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:19,170
complex and difficult and challenging

00:04:15,739 --> 00:04:22,830
that's one thing if there are artificial

00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:24,940
barriers that are making it needlessly

00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:28,360
slow and complex and time-consuming

00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:29,980
that's where you know you're talking

00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:31,780
about trying to solve problems and at

00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:35,830
the end of the day like if you're facing

00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:37,120
artificial barriers right you want your

00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:39,190
sense of achievement to be that you've

00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,050
accomplished something not that you've

00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:46,390
oh my god finally gotten through this

00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:48,400
horrible process right so we've also

00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:50,710
known for some time that contribution

00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:54,070
gets more challenging the higher up the

00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:57,880
ladder you go so this is a graph from

00:04:54,070 --> 00:05:00,850
the research that we did back in 2014

00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:02,860
this was the drupal association and the

00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:05,470
other cwg i was a member of at the time

00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:07,200
the content working group we did persona

00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:10,150
development for drupal.org so

00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:11,860
representing interviews with dozens of

00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:14,410
current and former members of the Drupal

00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:16,360
community as well as people who

00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:19,120
evaluated Drupal and ultimately chose

00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:22,540
not to adopt it or to become part of our

00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:24,280
community and so this this model is

00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:26,320
based on the Dreyfus model of skill

00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:28,870
acquisition and what we found is that

00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:30,760
while we're actually pretty good at

00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:33,340
onboarding people of the entry level of

00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:34,780
contribution we lose more and more

00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:37,150
people as we move up the ladder

00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:38,860
particularly you know once you can get

00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:40,870
past that learner and you're going into

00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:42,990
the skilled expert and master the number

00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:46,990
of people at those levels is

00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:49,540
dramatically less so you know dreams did

00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:51,700
some research earlier this year along

00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:55,150
with Matthew tift into the sponsorship

00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:56,830
of Drupal development and so so they

00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:59,710
found that despite the large number of

00:05:56,830 --> 00:06:01,450
individual contributors it's a very very

00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:04,690
small number that do the majority of the

00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:07,540
work so 51-percent of the contributors

00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:10,150
involved got just one credit while the

00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:13,120
top 30 contributors which is represents

00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:15,580
the top one half of one percent of all

00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:21,970
contributors accounted for over twenty

00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:23,530
one percent of the total credits so what

00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:25,630
we really should be doing is helping

00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:27,010
more people move up the contribution

00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:29,740
ladder in order to spread the burden

00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:31,900
across more shoulders right this also

00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:34,330
helps create more engaged community

00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:37,870
members which also has the impact of

00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:38,630
increasing Drupal adoption right make it

00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:40,220
in her

00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:41,780
you know plenary session this morning

00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:44,120
talked about the adoption and

00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:46,310
contribution journeys and if you saw

00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:48,260
that graph that you showed it's a circle

00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:51,140
they all feed into each other they're

00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:52,940
intertwined issues you know we know that

00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:54,560
one of the historical hurdles to Drupal

00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:56,660
adoption has been the shortage and

00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,640
talent and the long-term sustainability

00:06:56,660 --> 00:07:03,620
of our project depends on our ability to

00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:05,060
resolve that problem so how do we get

00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:06,560
more insight into the root causes of

00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:09,260
these common issues that are experienced

00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:11,510
by contributors right and fundamentally

00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:13,250
how can we find an answer to the

00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:15,350
question of what can we as a community

00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:16,910
do to help improve the experience of

00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:18,620
contributing to Drupal for everyone

00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:20,570
right now I want to be really clear

00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:22,580
we're not talking about technical

00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:24,980
solutions here but things that we can do

00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:29,840
as people to help make Drupal

00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:32,120
contribution more accessible so yeah we

00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:34,450
we launched yet another contributor

00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:37,310
survey at drupalcon New Orleans

00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:38,870
soliciting feedback from people who had

00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:40,880
been involved in contributing to Drupal

00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:43,670
and particularly and during the Drupal 8

00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:46,520
development cycle you know we publicize

00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:49,900
the survey on drupal.org we broadcasted

00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:53,600
as widely as possible via social media

00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:55,370
but it wasn't all we did we also reached

00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:57,110
out to and held follow-up interviews

00:07:55,370 --> 00:08:00,380
with a lot of the people who had

00:07:57,110 --> 00:08:03,290
responded to the survey and asked said

00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:04,820
it was okay to reach out we talked to

00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:07,040
those people both virtually we also

00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:08,390
talked to a bunch of people in person at

00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:11,540
various Drupal events that we were

00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:13,100
attending this summer so very quickly

00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:16,660
let's take a look at the demographics of

00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:19,850
the survey so we had 109 respondents

00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:22,670
gender breakdown was eighty-six percent

00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:25,610
male 10% female and four percent chose

00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:28,370
not to share that may sound very skewed

00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:31,430
but it's actually fairly consistent with

00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:33,020
drupal.org analytics which are about

00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:36,140
eighty four percent male and sixteen

00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:38,990
percent female it's also fairly

00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:41,539
consistent if you take an average of

00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:43,190
North American and European Drupal

00:08:41,539 --> 00:08:46,580
kant's and the gender breakdowns between

00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:48,380
them it's it's pretty consistent so

00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:50,460
there were 33 countries represented in

00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:52,540
our survey

00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:54,820
thirty-nine percent of respondents were

00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:56,980
from the United States that's probably a

00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:59,770
little bit high drupal.org analytics are

00:08:56,980 --> 00:09:01,450
closer to about twenty one percent six

00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:03,940
percent of the respondents in our survey

00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:05,920
were from India while about twelve

00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:09,430
percent of drupal.org traffic is from

00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:12,310
India and you know other countries that

00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:14,050
are not that were more representative or

00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:15,730
that were less represented in our survey

00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:17,890
would include France Russia and Ukraine

00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:22,960
which also have a fair number of

00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:24,430
drupal.org visitors over half the people

00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,840
who responded to our survey have been

00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:28,360
contributing to Drupal for more than

00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:29,890
five years and nearly three quarters

00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:32,800
have been contributing for at least

00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:35,220
three years so if this is representative

00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:37,990
of the contributor community as a whole

00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:40,870
than the the lack of fresh contributor

00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:42,730
talent is a concern particularly given

00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:45,370
there was another contributor survey

00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:47,050
done back in 2011 which indicated that

00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:48,930
only half of respondents have been

00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:52,090
contributing for more than three years

00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:54,460
so you know this may indicate that our

00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:59,410
contributor pool is is aging and

00:09:54,460 --> 00:10:01,330
narrowing more than half of our

00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:03,250
respondents spend less than four hours a

00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:05,290
week contributing a Drupal with the

00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:07,660
other you know twenty eight point five

00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:11,290
percent spending five to ten hours a

00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:13,840
week so for this one how did you

00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:17,170
contribute to Drupal 8 we let folks

00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:19,120
provide more than one response so you

00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:22,000
know the highest percentage was helped

00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:24,910
write code for a Drupal contributed

00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,430
modular theme the second was helped

00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:30,040
write code for Drupal core help provide

00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:31,900
a dribble community support which in

00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:34,000
this case includes things like project

00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:37,750
management sprint organization and other

00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:43,330
vents training mentoring etc helped

00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:46,540
write Drupal documentation helped to

00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:49,090
work on the you know design UX those

00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:54,370
sorts of things didn't contribute to

00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:55,870
Drupal and anyway and another about

00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:57,490
forty percent of respondents said they

00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:59,290
experienced burnout during the

00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:00,640
development of Drupal 8 so we asked

00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:02,170
those people what they thought were the

00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,970
leading factors that contributed to

00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:07,000
their burnout and these were

00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:09,310
some of the things that we heard slow

00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,310
progress bike shedding feeling over my

00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:13,329
head lots to do before deadline

00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:16,300
contributing on top of a full workday

00:11:13,329 --> 00:11:20,050
suspect this sounds very familiar to a

00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:21,970
lot of folks development cycle is way

00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:24,790
too long there's always more to do and

00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:27,100
notify an end point so obviously this is

00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:29,139
something that's mitigated somewhat now

00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:31,060
by semantic versioning and scheduled

00:11:29,139 --> 00:11:34,629
releases so hopefully we're making

00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:37,029
progress their lack of clear goals a

00:11:34,629 --> 00:11:41,189
very complex code base uncertain

00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:41,189
flexible deadlines eg feature fries

00:11:42,149 --> 00:11:46,600
difficult to move large patches forward

00:11:44,589 --> 00:11:48,879
very hard to find qualified reviewers

00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:52,839
and collaborators again this is

00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:54,329
something now we heard quite a bit very

00:11:52,839 --> 00:11:56,410
difficult to get patches reviewed

00:11:54,329 --> 00:11:58,000
inconsistent messages about deadlines

00:11:56,410 --> 00:12:00,490
and policies and inconsistent

00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,259
application of policies it feels like

00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:08,680
whatever the rules are they only apply

00:12:02,259 --> 00:12:10,240
to some people or some patches so sixty

00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:12,100
percent of our folks said that they had

00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:14,889
experienced or observed conflict during

00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:16,509
the d8 development cycle when we asked

00:12:14,889 --> 00:12:18,040
what they did about it most folks that

00:12:16,509 --> 00:12:20,439
they ignored it some said they

00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:23,230
intervened and or reported the issue to

00:12:20,439 --> 00:12:24,910
the cwg others said they either left the

00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:29,139
issue or stopped contributing all

00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:30,370
together nearly three-quarters of our

00:12:29,139 --> 00:12:32,139
respondents said that they were able to

00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:34,029
receive non technical support from

00:12:32,139 --> 00:12:36,430
others overwhelmingly from other

00:12:34,029 --> 00:12:39,009
contributors and the issue queues IRC

00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:42,009
annette in-person events smaller numbers

00:12:39,009 --> 00:12:46,839
cited work colleagues followed by family

00:12:42,009 --> 00:12:48,850
and friends our respondents were almost

00:12:46,839 --> 00:12:50,259
evenly split over whether or not there

00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:51,850
were non technical barriers to

00:12:50,259 --> 00:12:54,819
communication in the contributor

00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:57,009
community we ask those who answered yes

00:12:54,819 --> 00:12:58,889
what some of those barriers were these

00:12:57,009 --> 00:13:01,660
were some of the things that we heard

00:12:58,889 --> 00:13:03,160
feels like there are superstars and then

00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:04,750
everyone else and it's hard to feel

00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:08,709
encouraged to help out with the bigger

00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:10,779
initiatives and development again

00:13:08,709 --> 00:13:12,429
similar theme mostly perception the

00:13:10,779 --> 00:13:15,370
perception that people working on core a

00:13:12,429 --> 00:13:16,389
better or more important or are to be

00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:18,929
treated differently from other

00:13:16,389 --> 00:13:18,929
contributor

00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:23,940
number of folks talked about both issue

00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:25,770
queues and IRC as being a barrier to

00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:28,230
communication specifically but this is

00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:30,000
kind of a general feedback most of our

00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:32,010
communication is text-based and not real

00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,140
time and for many contributors it is in

00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:35,730
their non native language and it's leads

00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:39,630
to a lot of possibility for

00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:41,400
misunderstanding documentation is hard

00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:43,230
to discover again I know this is

00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:47,070
something that hopefully has changed

00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:51,840
recently with as the new documentation

00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:53,250
on drupal.org so almost two-thirds of

00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:54,870
our respondents said that they felt the

00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:56,370
experience of contributing a Drupal

00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:59,400
could be improved by some kind of

00:13:56,370 --> 00:14:01,980
organizational change we asked than

00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:03,360
those folks what kinds of organizational

00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:07,320
change would help improve the

00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:09,600
contributor experience more leadership

00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:11,640
from the top not necessarily a dictator

00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,140
but ideas vetted early at the top and

00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:17,070
then worked out by the community as a

00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:18,900
whole and power meant of initiative

00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:22,500
leads to make decisions in order to move

00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:27,450
work for forward we heard this come up

00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:29,460
several times we need more transparency

00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:31,140
and grow really grown well beyond this

00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:33,240
idea of a benevolent leader making the

00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:35,040
hard calls I'm not sure how to change

00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:36,900
that but it has to include more open

00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,850
democracy and some new blood so kind of

00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:40,830
a common theme that we were hearing was

00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:46,140
a more structured and more transparent

00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:47,580
decision-making process mentors should

00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:49,650
have a more important presence in the

00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:51,600
community we heard this from a lot of

00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:55,760
people that we not only needed more

00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,760
mentors but more one-on-one mentoring

00:14:56,510 --> 00:15:01,380
the process to approve sandbox project

00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:03,000
as full projects needs to be much leaner

00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:06,240
it's too difficult to have a project

00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,860
approved with a lot of people complained

00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:13,410
about the project application review

00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:15,600
process so we spent most of this

00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:18,030
presentation so far talking about the

00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:20,070
frustrations and problems that people

00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:22,380
have contributed a Drupal but but there

00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:23,790
is a silver lining over three-quarters

00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:25,680
of the people that we talked to

00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:28,020
indicated that they were very likely or

00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:29,930
extremely likely to continue to

00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:31,670
contribute to future versions of Drupal

00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:34,520
based on their experience contributing

00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:37,640
to Drupal 8 so we have a very loyal

00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:39,620
community and our what our challenges is

00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:45,399
to make sure we continue to earn that

00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:48,410
loyalty so this is our final question

00:15:45,399 --> 00:15:49,970
what is the number one non-technical

00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:51,350
change that you feel should be made to

00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:53,570
improve the Drupal contributor

00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:56,149
experience I don't have a pretty graph

00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:58,880
here because we just let people type in

00:15:56,149 --> 00:16:00,800
whatever they wanted so here's what some

00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:03,020
of them said again this is a fairly

00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:06,890
representative sample of the responses

00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:08,570
that we've received lower entry barriers

00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:12,440
by making it easier to contribute

00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:14,330
modules fix the application project

00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:17,750
application review process like I said

00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:19,310
if we heard this a lot greater

00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:24,680
acknowledgement of non code

00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:26,810
contributions we need to improve our

00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:29,360
tools for contribute at least github

00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:32,209
level so this is not actually a

00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:34,400
non-technical change this is a technical

00:16:32,209 --> 00:16:36,350
change but enough people mentioned it

00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:40,250
that I thought it was good to include

00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:41,930
here more detailed road maps so

00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:44,330
potential contributors can see where

00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:48,980
they can jump in outside of just combing

00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:51,770
an issue queue and finally a feminist

00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:54,770
new world order which I personally agree

00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:57,290
would solve everything but is sadly

00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:59,870
outside the scope of our Authority has

00:16:57,290 --> 00:17:03,620
the community working group to implement

00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:06,050
so moving down to the second part of the

00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:08,929
presentation you know we've been talking

00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:10,850
a lot as a group for the last year about

00:17:08,929 --> 00:17:13,550
different ways to improve the Drupal

00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:14,780
contributor experience right so so what

00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:17,809
follows are a series of recommendations

00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:19,640
and these recommendations are based not

00:17:17,809 --> 00:17:21,620
just on the results of their surveys but

00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:24,470
you know the follow-up interviews and

00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:27,770
conversations that we've had as well as

00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:30,320
our own experiences as members of the

00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:32,900
Drupal community so we've divided these

00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:35,540
up into two buckets one bucket of things

00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:38,240
that are within the scope of the CW G's

00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:40,760
charter to kind of influence and lead

00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:42,860
and another bucket where things that we

00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:43,310
are you know where we're looking for

00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:45,590
that can

00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:52,280
unity to take leadership and to be clear

00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:55,640
neither bucket is deplorable so yes you

00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:57,620
get the election job thank you so first

00:17:55,640 --> 00:18:01,480
let's talk about some of the things that

00:17:57,620 --> 00:18:05,380
we want to see the community focus on

00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:07,940
streamline the review process okay so

00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:09,950
literally everyone is on board with this

00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:14,570
right I think we all agree that this is

00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:17,720
like a immediate problem that needs to

00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:19,580
be addressed and and so and I know that

00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:21,400
people are already working on this so

00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:25,220
we're not going to tell those people

00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:28,430
what to do but these are some of the

00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:31,450
things that we think any reforms to the

00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:33,680
review process should include right

00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:36,380
empowering and enable more people to be

00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:38,480
able to conduct reviews making the

00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:42,140
process more transparent to avoid an

00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:44,840
appearance of favoritism making it

00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:47,900
easier for reviewers to find unreviewed

00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:50,210
projects making it easier for reviewers

00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:54,650
to actually indicate definitively that

00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:57,550
they have approved you know something in

00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:59,840
an issue queue or a project or a patch

00:18:57,550 --> 00:19:02,600
you know and the community really needs

00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:04,070
to provide encouragement and support to

00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:07,220
the people who are already working on

00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:11,180
this and really you know you know I know

00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:13,730
that there are a lot of different you

00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:15,940
know can sometimes conflicting interests

00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:22,310
at play but I really think that there

00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:26,180
you know we can find a balance so number

00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:28,430
to improve communication don't rely so

00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:30,800
heavily on a higher see especially for

00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:32,480
new contributors you know this is

00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:38,600
something that we've heard that you know

00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:42,140
I think IRC was very very important you

00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:44,960
know in the first decade or so of you

00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:46,850
know drupal's life but you know IRC is

00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:49,790
something that not as many people are

00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:52,070
using these days you know there are

00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:55,280
other other channels other other ways

00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:57,140
that people can you know communicate so

00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:58,760
you know to that end you

00:19:57,140 --> 00:20:01,730
we think it's really important to mix

00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:04,970
both asynchronous and real-time channels

00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:07,520
skype hangouts like etc as appropriate

00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:11,060
you don't have to be all one or all the

00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:12,650
other you know and understanding and

00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:16,880
appreciating that English is not

00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:18,890
everyone's first language right so one

00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:21,740
kind of little anecdote I have here is

00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:24,440
you know a friend in the Drupal

00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:28,340
community last year got really really

00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:31,060
upset because someone someone wrote in a

00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:33,740
in a you know comment or a queue that

00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:38,270
you know they had written this thing and

00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:40,820
the person wrote about how I demand you

00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:43,100
provide me you know more information or

00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:44,720
more context about this thing and this

00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:46,970
friend was really really upset by this

00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:50,330
it's like what right does this person to

00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:53,660
have to like demand things of me and and

00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:57,260
then someone else pointed out you know

00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:59,840
is this a native French speaker and and

00:20:57,260 --> 00:21:02,210
they're like oh yes and it's like well

00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:04,430
actually you know the literal

00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:06,830
translation from French when you say

00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:09,890
demand it it's actually more like a

00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:12,080
polite request and and so you know they

00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:15,650
were being respectful but it didn't come

00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:17,270
across that way in English and so you

00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:19,030
know we've seen this come up in many

00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:22,160
many as several issues that have been

00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:25,340
escalated to us where you know things

00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:27,500
can sound you know less polite or blunt

00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:29,660
or if English is not your first language

00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:31,790
and so you know i think that people

00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:36,140
that's something that people really need

00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:38,330
to understand and appreciate you know

00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:40,070
and then making it easier for newcomers

00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:42,650
to know where to go to connect with

00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:44,570
other contributors so they they don't

00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:46,430
feel so much you know kind of on their

00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:49,610
own you know you come to drupalcon or a

00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:51,880
big drupal event you know you get you

00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:54,440
get the raw bruh community like

00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:59,720
mentorship experience and then where do

00:21:54,440 --> 00:22:04,010
you go from here so roadmap

00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:06,200
communication so so first creating easy

00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:09,950
to find summaries of active initiatives

00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:10,669
on drupal.org making it easier for

00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:12,649
contributors

00:22:10,669 --> 00:22:16,399
get involved with initiatives that

00:22:12,649 --> 00:22:18,200
interest them you know and a lot of the

00:22:16,399 --> 00:22:21,669
the the suggestions here the

00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:24,679
recommendations here are really designed

00:22:21,669 --> 00:22:28,940
right now if an initiative is already in

00:22:24,679 --> 00:22:31,580
progress it's not so easy to jump into

00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:33,320
it so so really what we want to make

00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:35,690
sure is that you know even folks we're

00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:39,139
not there at the beginning can still

00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:42,320
very easily find and jump into you know

00:22:39,139 --> 00:22:44,989
something that's going on at the

00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:46,789
appropriate level and don't have to

00:22:44,989 --> 00:22:49,309
spend all this time you know getting

00:22:46,789 --> 00:22:52,159
caught up to speed on what you know what

00:22:49,309 --> 00:22:54,769
we're trying to do here clarifying the

00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:57,109
role of initiative leads you know this

00:22:54,769 --> 00:23:00,609
is again something that you know we've

00:22:57,109 --> 00:23:02,149
heard quite a bit and then improving

00:23:00,609 --> 00:23:03,919
documentation and providing

00:23:02,149 --> 00:23:05,359
architectural overviews for future

00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:08,119
contributors again this is something

00:23:05,359 --> 00:23:11,269
that happens very often at the at the

00:23:08,119 --> 00:23:13,279
beginning of an initiative but making

00:23:11,269 --> 00:23:16,249
sure we're keeping that information up

00:23:13,279 --> 00:23:19,609
to be up to date not only lets folks

00:23:16,249 --> 00:23:21,320
come in you know if it's if it's an in

00:23:19,609 --> 00:23:23,149
progress initiative but if it's

00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:25,399
something that gets revisited later on

00:23:23,149 --> 00:23:29,359
down the road you know we don't have to

00:23:25,399 --> 00:23:31,429
reinvent the wheel so now moving onto

00:23:29,359 --> 00:23:34,429
that second bucket of things that we as

00:23:31,429 --> 00:23:38,869
a community working group really you

00:23:34,429 --> 00:23:43,840
know want to focus on so mentorship is a

00:23:38,869 --> 00:23:46,639
big one we want to move the focus beyond

00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:48,710
onboarding newcomers and core mentorship

00:23:46,639 --> 00:23:50,450
hours this is not just about onboarding

00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:52,669
people but making sure that we're moving

00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:55,309
them up that engagement ladder so that

00:23:52,669 --> 00:23:56,809
mentorship continues mentorship is not

00:23:55,309 --> 00:24:00,259
just for people at the bottom of the

00:23:56,809 --> 00:24:04,609
ladder mentorship needs to be present in

00:24:00,259 --> 00:24:06,940
some capacity at every level one of the

00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:09,559
things we were quite a bit was pairing

00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:12,049
mentors with high potential contributors

00:24:09,559 --> 00:24:14,090
for long term one-on-one mentorship like

00:24:12,049 --> 00:24:17,749
almost kind of like a buddy system right

00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:21,200
and the reality is that this does happen

00:24:17,749 --> 00:24:23,970
right now but in an informal way right

00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:26,730
so we talked with some you know

00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:29,760
core contributors you know who were like

00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:31,380
I wouldn't be here if I have if

00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:35,220
so-and-so and so-and-so and so-and-so

00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:37,140
hadn't like generously like worked with

00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:39,810
me one-on-one to help me get where I am

00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:41,970
today what I'm suggesting we need to do

00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:44,760
is you know what we're suggesting we

00:24:41,970 --> 00:24:46,470
need to do is formalize that make that

00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:50,310
something that's more structured so that

00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:52,710
people have that ladder providing more

00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:54,570
non-code mentoring opportunities so one

00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:57,030
big one that came up in particular is

00:24:54,570 --> 00:24:59,040
camp organizing so you know very

00:24:57,030 --> 00:25:02,040
frequently a few if you have a camp

00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:03,690
there's you know one person or a small

00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:06,690
group of people who really take the

00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:08,190
leadership and spend a lot of time and

00:25:06,690 --> 00:25:12,000
effort and energy putting a camp

00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:14,430
together and if that knowledge is not

00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:17,040
transferred then the next year

00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:18,960
everything the wheel gets reinvented all

00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:20,820
over again so if there's an opportunity

00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:23,310
for people who are like this is

00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:26,070
something I'm interested in to you know

00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:29,340
to receive mentorship from those people

00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:31,440
to help out and and then they can you

00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:34,520
know be better position to step into

00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:36,720
those leadership roles moving forward

00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:40,350
providing more support and training to

00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:42,630
mentors you know we have a number of

00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:46,530
really fantastic mentors in our

00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:49,710
community you know who do a tremendous

00:25:46,530 --> 00:25:52,260
amount of work you know but we need to

00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:54,150
be able to provide nut their existing

00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:55,890
mentors with support as well as

00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:58,130
additional trains we can build up a

00:25:55,890 --> 00:26:00,570
really strong mentorship community and

00:25:58,130 --> 00:26:04,380
then finally promoting mentorship

00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:06,870
success stories right you know we need

00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:09,960
we need to talk more about those stories

00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:12,830
where people who you know got mentorship

00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:15,620
were able to become like really you know

00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:21,330
wonderful members of our community so

00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:24,360
recognize and appreciate that so second

00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:26,310
leadership training and I want to be

00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:28,080
really clear that what we're talking

00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:30,720
about here is not just for initiative

00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:32,850
leads this is not code focus this is

00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,900
leadership across kind of all the

00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:35,149
different areas of the Drupal community

00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:41,330
whether that's a

00:26:35,149 --> 00:26:43,639
mentorship etc right so right now a lot

00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:46,369
of people find themselves put in

00:26:43,639 --> 00:26:48,429
informal leadership positions within our

00:26:46,369 --> 00:26:50,419
community and they don't have any

00:26:48,429 --> 00:26:52,940
preparation or training in basic

00:26:50,419 --> 00:26:54,769
leadership skills right some people are

00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:57,200
able to develop those skills on the fly

00:26:54,769 --> 00:26:59,359
or may possess them innately but others

00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:01,879
require you know a more structured

00:26:59,359 --> 00:27:04,849
approach so we need to go beyond just

00:27:01,879 --> 00:27:06,799
the innate skills that people have and

00:27:04,849 --> 00:27:09,229
so what we're suggesting is a structured

00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:11,559
program for current and emerging leaders

00:27:09,229 --> 00:27:14,690
in our community this would be you know

00:27:11,559 --> 00:27:18,440
you have a curriculum people we you know

00:27:14,690 --> 00:27:20,419
actually meet in some capacity and you

00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:23,239
know think of it like a like a class

00:27:20,419 --> 00:27:25,700
right and this would extend you know

00:27:23,239 --> 00:27:27,559
probably over over months in order to

00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:29,330
get there the focus will be on

00:27:27,559 --> 00:27:31,969
developing skills like create a problem

00:27:29,330 --> 00:27:36,259
solving conflict resolution effective

00:27:31,969 --> 00:27:38,119
advocacy and visioning and it would it

00:27:36,259 --> 00:27:40,129
would broaden an understanding of the

00:27:38,119 --> 00:27:41,839
Drupal community right as assets and its

00:27:40,129 --> 00:27:44,149
challenges right so we have a lot of

00:27:41,839 --> 00:27:46,609
folks you know who are leaders in the

00:27:44,149 --> 00:27:49,849
community and their leaders you know in

00:27:46,609 --> 00:27:52,159
their particular niche right but you

00:27:49,849 --> 00:27:54,379
know they don't necessarily have the

00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:56,149
full understanding of the breadth of

00:27:54,379 --> 00:27:58,639
like how all the different parts of our

00:27:56,149 --> 00:28:02,119
community fit together so the model i'm

00:27:58,639 --> 00:28:04,089
thinking of here is something that I've

00:28:02,119 --> 00:28:07,460
been through in my own local community

00:28:04,089 --> 00:28:09,919
adam has also been through it you know

00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:11,299
there this there's a model for this that

00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:14,719
exists of the community leadership

00:28:11,299 --> 00:28:16,789
program where you go around and you know

00:28:14,719 --> 00:28:19,190
you might have one meeting where you

00:28:16,789 --> 00:28:21,499
learn hey here's how the school system

00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:23,509
works in our community right here are

00:28:21,499 --> 00:28:26,029
the issues and the challenges that we're

00:28:23,509 --> 00:28:27,589
facing with our school system here are

00:28:26,029 --> 00:28:30,139
the opportunities that we have and we

00:28:27,589 --> 00:28:32,149
might hear from representative of the

00:28:30,139 --> 00:28:34,549
teachers of the administration of the

00:28:32,149 --> 00:28:36,739
parents to really understand how things

00:28:34,549 --> 00:28:38,869
work and then you know in the next class

00:28:36,739 --> 00:28:41,119
you would learn about some other aspect

00:28:38,869 --> 00:28:43,489
of your community right so that's the

00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:46,129
idea here and the goal is really to

00:28:43,489 --> 00:28:47,630
create a network of leaders within the

00:28:46,129 --> 00:28:51,470
Drupal community that can real

00:28:47,630 --> 00:28:53,810
share knowledge and work together you

00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:56,330
know to create the sort of the sort of

00:28:53,810 --> 00:29:00,410
and transfer that knowledge to others

00:28:56,330 --> 00:29:01,670
right so i really think that if done

00:29:00,410 --> 00:29:03,830
well this is something that would have

00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:11,320
ongoing benefits for for everyone in our

00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:14,420
community so conflict resolution so

00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:16,640
we've got creating easy to find

00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:18,980
resources that people can use to resolve

00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:22,270
issues without having to escalate them

00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:24,470
whether that's to us or to someone else

00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:26,480
providing more conflict resolution

00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:28,550
sessions and training set ripple events

00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:30,620
so you know we have this being human

00:29:28,550 --> 00:29:34,430
track here at drupalcon dublin that's a

00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:36,830
really good first step you know and on

00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:38,270
these on these items as well you know we

00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:40,070
get a lot of help here already

00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:42,560
especially from the work that comes out

00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:44,750
of the community summits right this is a

00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:47,390
great opportunity for people to

00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:50,990
contribute that either don't know how or

00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:52,310
uncomfortable contributing code and in

00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:57,170
the end what we're trying to do is

00:29:52,310 --> 00:30:00,740
create a culture of empathy you know and

00:29:57,170 --> 00:30:02,990
it's funny you know trees trees talked

00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:04,700
about this earlier drew Gorton talked

00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:07,520
about this really seems to be kind of a

00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:09,740
theme maybe up this conference the

00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:11,750
answer here we think really lies in this

00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:15,380
you know come for the software stay for

00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:18,290
the community slogan right our greatest

00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:21,320
asset is in our code it's our people and

00:30:18,290 --> 00:30:24,590
all of our efforts at every level need

00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:27,700
to reflect that right so for those who

00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:30,500
may have been at drupalcon Barcelona or

00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:33,140
watch the session online at David roses

00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:34,940
did a session where he went into some of

00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:37,520
the academic research that he had done

00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:39,290
on Drupal community and contribution and

00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:41,750
one of the his findings was that we as a

00:30:39,290 --> 00:30:45,200
community tend to give less attention

00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:48,680
and thus less value to non-code

00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:50,420
contributions but really strongly made

00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:52,310
the point that it is those kinds of

00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:54,170
contributions that play a key role in

00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:57,830
the ongoing sustainability of our

00:30:54,170 --> 00:31:00,770
project so again I want to be really

00:30:57,830 --> 00:31:01,560
clear this is more than just about

00:31:00,770 --> 00:31:02,460
making sure the P

00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:04,860
we'll know how to take care of

00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:07,440
themselves right it's something that

00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:10,290
needs to be reinforced at all levels we

00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:12,240
need to stop glorifying overworked you

00:31:10,290 --> 00:31:13,980
know when people feel like they have to

00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:16,710
burn themselves out in order to be

00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:19,650
successful that's not an individual

00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:21,390
issue that is a sign of a larger

00:31:19,650 --> 00:31:25,800
structural problem that needs to be

00:31:21,390 --> 00:31:29,580
addressed so suggestions we've offered

00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:31,950
today are you know a starting point we

00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:35,010
want to they're designed to both address

00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:37,820
some of our immediate problems as well

00:31:35,010 --> 00:31:40,200
as helping to build out a structure to

00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:42,030
hopefully help support a healthy and

00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:47,750
sustainable contributor community in the

00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:50,160
long term so that's enough of me talking

00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:53,280
we'd like to spend the rest of the time

00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:55,980
here we have a really I think good group

00:31:53,280 --> 00:32:00,510
of people for this talking about some of

00:31:55,980 --> 00:32:02,010
the ideas and getting feedback so so if

00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:03,270
you are watching a recording of the

00:32:02,010 --> 00:32:05,460
session or if you aren't comfortable

00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:07,890
speaking up today that's okay you can

00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:10,280
reach out to us after the fact we put up

00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:13,110
our names and Twitter handles here and

we're very proud to announce that as of

00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:17,430
this morning we do have a new twitter

00:32:17,430 --> 00:32:21,720

issues please continue to do that

00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:33,300

00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:35,880
folks reporting stuff to us on Twitter

00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:38,730
but we would like to keep the community

00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:39,900
updated on you know both this work that

00:32:38,730 --> 00:32:43,680
we're doing and other things that are

00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:44,850
going on in the community so now I'm

00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:48,000
going to turn it over to Mike and Emma

00:32:44,850 --> 00:32:51,950
and you guys are going to lead the Q&A

00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,950
portion of the session thank you

00:32:56,920 --> 00:33:03,320
alright fantastic but your orange answer

00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:15,290
all of your questions yeah we knew it

00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:17,870
but the community is fixed all right gah

00:33:15,290 --> 00:33:20,150
Borg have some things so one of the

00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:21,260
things that we had a heated one of the

00:33:20,150 --> 00:33:25,190
things that we had a heated discussion

00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:26,990
about at the drupalcon slack channel i

00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:30,140
think as the drupal heroes twitter

00:33:26,990 --> 00:33:33,050
account which celebrates drupal heroes

00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:36,980
and i was trying to argue that it's bad

00:33:33,050 --> 00:33:38,810
because you should not i mean it makes

00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:40,880
it makes it a bad impression that you

00:33:38,810 --> 00:33:42,590
need to be a hero in drupal and i don't

00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:44,090
think we need heroes we need people to

00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:45,590
make things happen and they are no need

00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:48,500
to be heroes that we don't need to have

00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:51,860
like these like that's what what you

00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:54,020
said in the in the in the survey that

00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:55,430
there's these super super heroes who

00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:57,380
make everything work and then the rest

00:33:55,430 --> 00:34:00,380
of the people and that makes the rest

00:33:57,380 --> 00:34:01,880
that makes the making things happen much

00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:05,330
harder to achieve if you think you need

00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:07,850
to achieve superhero status to be able

00:34:05,330 --> 00:34:12,530
to do things and I think the way we

00:34:07,850 --> 00:34:15,380
celebrate our biggest achievers may not

00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:17,030
be the right way and they were like

00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:18,650
multiple opinions there and some people

00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:20,950
said that what we need to do that their

00:34:18,650 --> 00:34:23,540
celebrations like and it makes me

00:34:20,950 --> 00:34:25,429
empowered as somebody said that it makes

00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:27,320
them empowered when triple heroes tweets

00:34:25,429 --> 00:34:32,720
about them or retweets their tweets you

00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:35,750
know like yeah maybe well I think the I

00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:39,530
think the key there is how it's promoted

00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:41,360
right right so you can I mean I think by

00:34:39,530 --> 00:34:43,640
now they're not a whole lot of fans of

00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:48,230
people using the term rock star or a

00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:51,590
hero and but I think the key is if you

00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:54,350
can promote a success story and that

00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:56,690
success story can speak to other people

00:34:54,350 --> 00:34:58,730
who started from a similar place and had

00:34:56,690 --> 00:35:01,550
find common ground saying oh well that

00:34:58,730 --> 00:35:03,980
person you know they're a you know a

00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:06,920
middle-aged white guy from Florida and

00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:08,480
he did it so you know I'm a middle-aged

00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,650
if a middle-aged white guy from Florida

00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:14,109
can

00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:16,270
do it anyone can we're gonna go far but

00:35:14,109 --> 00:35:20,140
I mean it you know the i agree with you

00:35:16,270 --> 00:35:22,690
where the superlative that we use is

00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:24,849
probably not the best idea but i like

00:35:22,690 --> 00:35:26,920
the idea of success stories that other

00:35:24,849 --> 00:35:28,779
people that community can relate to and

00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:31,270
say well they can do it I can do it

00:35:28,779 --> 00:35:32,980
right I mean I think it's right I mean

00:35:31,270 --> 00:35:36,670
it also has to do with with how you

00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:39,220
think of what a hero is right so so

00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:41,020
there's you know there are your comic

00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:43,329
book superheroes who are able to achieve

00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:45,940
what they achieve because they have

00:35:43,329 --> 00:35:49,539
amazing powers or abilities or if you're

00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:53,380
Batman just lots of money right and you

00:35:49,539 --> 00:35:54,970
know and that's that's not the image we

00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:56,829
want to promote that is not at all what

00:35:54,970 --> 00:36:00,369
we want to promote but but I think this

00:35:56,829 --> 00:36:02,260
idea that like everyone anyone can be a

00:36:00,369 --> 00:36:05,980
hero this idea of the everyday hero

00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:08,440
right you know so you know we we often

00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:10,329
at least in America talk about like you

00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:12,190
know people like policemen and

00:36:10,329 --> 00:36:15,849
firefighters and other people who do

00:36:12,190 --> 00:36:19,420
kinds of public service right as as sort

00:36:15,849 --> 00:36:21,670
of everyday heroes and you know and and

00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:25,660
I think I and personally I like that

00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:27,910
kind of idea but you know I'm not

00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:30,010
familiar with the feed so I haven't you

00:36:27,910 --> 00:36:34,660
know I don't know exactly how it's being

00:36:30,010 --> 00:36:36,069
used right now pull Johnson hey I just

00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:39,369
want to ask her way just said really and

00:36:36,069 --> 00:36:41,319
I helped to run the area for social

00:36:39,369 --> 00:36:43,349
media and one thing I've consciously

00:36:41,319 --> 00:36:46,599
done over the last two years is to

00:36:43,349 --> 00:36:48,910
pinpoint somebody who is not hero

00:36:46,599 --> 00:36:50,829
somebody who is from a country where

00:36:48,910 --> 00:36:53,710
perhaps Drupal isn't very big or and

00:36:50,829 --> 00:36:57,010
they've had a small achievement and by

00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:59,650
shining a huge spotlight on that make

00:36:57,010 --> 00:37:02,799
them feel amazing and hopefully inspire

00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:05,380
us to follow see so I've kind of flipped

00:37:02,799 --> 00:37:07,569
on its head I can see a place for both

00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:11,279
things but I'm quite comfortable the

00:37:07,569 --> 00:37:11,279
idea of heroes as well yeah

00:37:13,369 --> 00:37:17,339
so I think what I'm hearing you say is

00:37:15,569 --> 00:37:19,589
that it would be effective if you

00:37:17,339 --> 00:37:21,329
focused on the process as well as the

00:37:19,589 --> 00:37:22,410
outcome it's not just outcome driven but

00:37:21,329 --> 00:37:25,229
one of the things I'm really interested

00:37:22,410 --> 00:37:28,470
in everyone in this room's thoughts on

00:37:25,229 --> 00:37:29,930
is you reiterated several times in the

00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:33,539
presentation that we need to value

00:37:29,930 --> 00:37:35,039
non-code contributions as well and to me

00:37:33,539 --> 00:37:37,400
I see contribution in three different

00:37:35,039 --> 00:37:39,119
areas I see contribution and code

00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:42,299
contribution financially and

00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:44,519
contribution in volunteer time whether

00:37:42,299 --> 00:37:46,170
it's with events or you know other

00:37:44,519 --> 00:37:47,759
committee we're a community working

00:37:46,170 --> 00:37:49,890
group takes a lot of time just in case

00:37:47,759 --> 00:37:53,099
anybody know it's a lot time investment

00:37:49,890 --> 00:37:55,769
and for those watching the recording

00:37:53,099 --> 00:37:58,140
this is tiffany Veras who I also happen

00:37:55,769 --> 00:38:00,470
to be married to yeah Jesu it takes a

00:37:58,140 --> 00:38:03,599
lot there's a lot of time they're

00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:06,289
wearing my wife hat wearing my board hat

00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:10,049
I have a different question which is how

00:38:06,289 --> 00:38:12,779
would we go about finding ways to create

00:38:10,049 --> 00:38:17,609
a rubric of contribution if we were to

00:38:12,779 --> 00:38:19,739
recognize it how do we create that way

00:38:17,609 --> 00:38:22,289
to quantify those those contributions

00:38:19,739 --> 00:38:25,170
right now we have a way to recognize

00:38:22,289 --> 00:38:27,269
code contributions in core based on

00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:29,549
commits and we know that that that's

00:38:27,269 --> 00:38:31,589
been in big step forward for us but it

00:38:29,549 --> 00:38:34,079
certainly is limited in its scope right

00:38:31,589 --> 00:38:36,690
now because it you know they're commits

00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:38,009
to core or and there you know based on

00:38:36,690 --> 00:38:39,390
each commit so if it's a really big

00:38:38,009 --> 00:38:41,279
commit or really smell from it it's

00:38:39,390 --> 00:38:43,499
still one commit right so what I'm

00:38:41,279 --> 00:38:47,309
interested in our thoughts around how do

00:38:43,499 --> 00:38:50,900
we quantify and so that we can recognize

00:38:47,309 --> 00:38:50,900
those kinds of contributions

00:38:58,130 --> 00:39:03,570
you're the one that's supposed to answer

00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:05,850
yeah I know well let me let me let me

00:39:03,570 --> 00:39:08,100
let me take one out of out of out of

00:39:05,850 --> 00:39:09,750
that the rubric of three kinds of

00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:11,670
contribution let me let me just take one

00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:13,710
out all right which is which is

00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:17,310
financial contribution because that's

00:39:13,710 --> 00:39:21,020
pretty easy yeah you yeah that's like

00:39:17,310 --> 00:39:23,760
whatever sponsorship advertising so

00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:26,970
people who have money usually do not

00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:30,900
have difficulty getting attention right

00:39:26,970 --> 00:39:32,280
so so really you know I think and we you

00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:34,950
know like you said you know we know how

00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:39,900
to focus on you know I'm talk about code

00:39:34,950 --> 00:39:43,010
not in a perfect way but you know so I

00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:47,220
think really the key is are the are the

00:39:43,010 --> 00:39:51,870
non code you know community time that

00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:54,150
the the organizing the you know events

00:39:51,870 --> 00:39:56,760
all of that sort of thing how do those

00:39:54,150 --> 00:40:00,030
how do we make sure that those kinds of

00:39:56,760 --> 00:40:04,320
contributions are are understood and

00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:05,460
recognized to be valuable so the first

00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:08,070
thing I've some I had the thoughts

00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:11,940
because we mentioned the mentorship and

00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:14,520
like the buddy system and things and the

00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:15,450
first step we can do is just someone who

00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:17,730
is aware of what you're doing

00:40:15,450 --> 00:40:19,560
recognizing it directly to you as well

00:40:17,730 --> 00:40:21,780
so you have the body was like hey you

00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:23,310
did that really good thing and also if

00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:25,080
they're comfortable that promoting that

00:40:23,310 --> 00:40:27,480
like just sharing that the world

00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:29,160
everything having system of everyone

00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:30,570
looking at not looking after but like

00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:33,210
being aware of everyone and keeping

00:40:30,570 --> 00:40:35,730
around things and and supporting and

00:40:33,210 --> 00:40:37,410
encouraging and empowering is super

00:40:35,730 --> 00:40:39,420
important for our community because like

00:40:37,410 --> 00:40:41,460
we come to these events and people say

00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:42,750
to me like I really like we did like six

00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:44,850
months ago and stuff and I'm like oh

00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:47,940
thank you so Mike this event gives you

00:40:44,850 --> 00:40:51,000
so much encouragement and like feel good

00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:53,540
feels but like every day kind of yeah if

00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,540
it was more

00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:06,510
something like heard was the easiest way

00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:08,160
to make non-core contribution recognized

00:41:06,510 --> 00:41:11,910
as if we can get that into the issue

00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:14,430
queue have people to review it and then

00:41:11,910 --> 00:41:16,830
commit as soon as you have a certain

00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:18,420
number of reviews so the easiest thing

00:41:16,830 --> 00:41:20,340
for them to implement possibly is

00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:23,190
something that could just snap to what

00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:24,990
their Audrey to eat and get some kind of

00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:28,470
fun right because you because really the

00:41:24,990 --> 00:41:31,260
big core question here that we haven't

00:41:28,470 --> 00:41:34,830
focused on is the how do we quantify it

00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:38,870
right so you know if I spend you know

00:41:34,830 --> 00:41:43,610
where someone spends you know two months

00:41:38,870 --> 00:41:47,880
organizing a drupalcamp how does that

00:41:43,610 --> 00:41:52,020
contribution get get quantified and and

00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:53,790
you know understood I'm are comfortable

00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:55,950
with that question because I think with

00:41:53,790 --> 00:41:58,080
what we should ask is why we want to

00:41:55,950 --> 00:42:00,720
quantify it like what we want to get out

00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:02,400
of the quantities that we measured then

00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:04,800
we want to put them against each others

00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:06,390
like you contributed for hours and like

00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:08,460
that person going to be the two months

00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:10,620
and like right they are like 20 times

00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:13,140
better than you or whatever I don't know

00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:16,080
I think we wanted to look I want to

00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:19,110
recognize them and I don't know if we

00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:22,140
need to quantify them so precisely to

00:42:19,110 --> 00:42:24,180
recognize them so if we don't need to

00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:26,400
quantify them so precisely then we can

00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:28,920
use different tools to recognize them

00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:31,890
compared to if we really want to know

00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:34,560
how many hours they put in well I think

00:42:31,890 --> 00:42:37,440
there's there's two benefits to being

00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:38,540
able to quantify at some level number

00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:41,910
one there's a benefit to the community

00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:43,650
to just have that data just to know so

00:42:41,910 --> 00:42:46,800
that's you know there's a value there

00:42:43,650 --> 00:42:49,950
and the second valve that the second

00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:53,790
item is you know I off to talk to my

00:42:49,950 --> 00:42:57,060
students about using contributions to

00:42:53,790 --> 00:42:58,620
market themselves and so that's you know

00:42:57,060 --> 00:42:59,150
so there's a value to the community and

00:42:58,620 --> 00:43:02,450
there's a

00:42:59,150 --> 00:43:07,130
you to the individual and being able con

00:43:02,450 --> 00:43:08,960
fight but it's a it's a extremely

00:43:07,130 --> 00:43:11,480
difficult problem as far as how do you

00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:15,410
actually is it a number we're talking

00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:18,080
about you know or is it a you know do we

00:43:15,410 --> 00:43:20,720
do we start you know saying well if you

00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:23,060
organize an event that's you know five

00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:25,310
times as important as organizing and

00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:27,350
meet up you know there's which will

00:43:25,310 --> 00:43:30,530
never happen but will never come to any

00:43:27,350 --> 00:43:36,730
agreement on that and nor should we hi

00:43:30,530 --> 00:43:39,470
Jamie McKenna so two points one is that

00:43:36,730 --> 00:43:42,320
we're not the only open source community

00:43:39,470 --> 00:43:44,960
deals right this the WordPress community

00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:46,700
have put a lot of effort into

00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:49,160
documenting some of the things they do

00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:51,650
getting running events and running

00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:53,630
meetups and whatnot so there's a lot of

00:43:51,650 --> 00:43:56,900
content out there worth looking into

00:43:53,630 --> 00:44:02,150
there's also a presentation right after

00:43:56,900 --> 00:44:04,130
this one from Jenny wom who is heavily

00:44:02,150 --> 00:44:08,380
involved in the WordPress community but

00:44:04,130 --> 00:44:11,930
also somewhat in Drupal as well on

00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:15,860
various aspects of the WordPress

00:44:11,930 --> 00:44:18,020
community and what they do so it's I'd

00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:22,370
recommend everybody well people who have

00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:29,240
the time go to that the other point is

00:44:22,370 --> 00:44:34,820
that I from my own point at or

00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:42,680
experiences at work one of the problems

00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:46,360
I constantly see is a barrier for entry

00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:48,770
for making their first contribution

00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:57,080
people making the first contribution and

00:44:48,770 --> 00:45:02,420
and a almost a slight I don't know fear

00:44:57,080 --> 00:45:04,190
or reluctance to get involved and so

00:45:02,420 --> 00:45:07,070
we're trying to come up with a an

00:45:04,190 --> 00:45:09,410
internal mentoring program to break down

00:45:07,070 --> 00:45:11,350
that barrier to make it easier for

00:45:09,410 --> 00:45:14,300
people because

00:45:11,350 --> 00:45:17,270
from personal experience I found you

00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:19,550
become a you can work with your tools

00:45:17,270 --> 00:45:22,900
better if this barrier is not in your

00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:25,280
way if you feel that you shouldn't

00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:29,270
contribute because well it's only just

00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:31,730
me every contribution is valuable in

00:45:29,270 --> 00:45:34,520
some way so if we can get people over

00:45:31,730 --> 00:45:36,890
that initial learning curve right ya

00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:39,470
mean and that's the idea behind you know

00:45:36,890 --> 00:45:42,100
the one on one or small group mentorship

00:45:39,470 --> 00:45:45,410
right and you know one of the things

00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:47,660
that kind of came up and you know the

00:45:45,410 --> 00:45:51,200
interviews that we did is that you know

00:45:47,660 --> 00:45:53,720
so we very often have these you know big

00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:55,820
things on you know sprint day where you

00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:58,820
know we'll have a large audience of

00:45:55,820 --> 00:46:00,830
fresh new awesome people and you know

00:45:58,820 --> 00:46:03,350
will you know walk them through that

00:46:00,830 --> 00:46:05,720
whole process here's how you do it in

00:46:03,350 --> 00:46:09,260
everything and then you know but that's

00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:12,550
exhausting that is a lot of work and you

00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:16,430
know at the end of the day there's a

00:46:12,550 --> 00:46:18,410
small number of you know people in that

00:46:16,430 --> 00:46:21,470
room who will be so excited and so

00:46:18,410 --> 00:46:26,330
energized and really want to move

00:46:21,470 --> 00:46:29,480
forward but there's no capacity to keep

00:46:26,330 --> 00:46:32,810
you know to keep working them because

00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:34,900
it's like the mentors like you know I'm

00:46:32,810 --> 00:46:39,620
exhausted I'm done I've done this and

00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:42,140
you know so it's it's it's getting not

00:46:39,620 --> 00:46:43,670
just that first step right you know but

00:46:42,140 --> 00:46:46,340
but moving along that path i mean i was

00:46:43,670 --> 00:46:48,140
i was struck this morning when when

00:46:46,340 --> 00:46:49,370
Megan was up there and she's like you

00:46:48,140 --> 00:46:51,320
know going through the story of her

00:46:49,370 --> 00:46:53,540
first commit and it's like I mean ok

00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:56,750
this is the executive director of the

00:46:53,540 --> 00:46:59,480
drupal association and like you know she

00:46:56,750 --> 00:47:01,280
got direct access to Angie and you know

00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:03,200
Peter will on and immediately came in

00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:05,240
and reviewed or patch and like that's

00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:09,740
not the experience that most people have

00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:13,250
right and you know but how can we make

00:47:09,740 --> 00:47:16,850
sure you know that that folks who you

00:47:13,250 --> 00:47:19,850
know who are going to be you know good

00:47:16,850 --> 00:47:21,710
contributors have you know get something

00:47:19,850 --> 00:47:24,349
close to that level of attention right

00:47:21,710 --> 00:47:27,589
to your first point about

00:47:24,349 --> 00:47:29,420
other communities yes we know we are

00:47:27,589 --> 00:47:32,150
absolutely looking at things of what

00:47:29,420 --> 00:47:34,339
other communities are doing you know I

00:47:32,150 --> 00:47:37,579
had a great conversation yesterday with

00:47:34,339 --> 00:47:39,979
christo fantôme was talking about you

00:47:37,579 --> 00:47:42,680
know a lot of the work that the Django

00:47:39,979 --> 00:47:44,660
community is doing they're a different

00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:47,059
community than us in many ways but

00:47:44,660 --> 00:47:49,700
they've really focused on a lot of these

00:47:47,059 --> 00:47:51,619
questions at a very deep way they've

00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:53,239
even stolen our slogan and I said that

00:47:51,619 --> 00:47:58,009
was okay because we stole their conflict

00:47:53,239 --> 00:48:01,400
resolution policy so that's fair but

00:47:58,009 --> 00:48:03,769
yeah Gabor yes I'm so I'm excited about

00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:05,869
the next step after the the first

00:48:03,769 --> 00:48:08,569
contributions prints because that's sort

00:48:05,869 --> 00:48:10,789
of highly related to my day job which is

00:48:08,569 --> 00:48:15,109
good so my day job is I man I'm an

00:48:10,789 --> 00:48:18,380
initiative coordinator coordinator so my

00:48:15,109 --> 00:48:19,670
job is to try to spread the some of the

00:48:18,380 --> 00:48:21,170
good things that we figure it out

00:48:19,670 --> 00:48:23,839
through Drupal its development in

00:48:21,170 --> 00:48:25,729
initiatives to other initiatives right

00:48:23,839 --> 00:48:28,579
and one of the things that we figured

00:48:25,729 --> 00:48:31,609
out is to kind of in the initiative so

00:48:28,579 --> 00:48:33,440
let me start from bit back so I think

00:48:31,609 --> 00:48:36,829
the problem with Drupal is that it's

00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:38,690
huge and scary and you have you have a

00:48:36,829 --> 00:48:41,630
hard time figuring out where to connect

00:48:38,690 --> 00:48:43,519
and initiatives are small and nice

00:48:41,630 --> 00:48:45,559
because there's a small group of people

00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:48,589
we have a shared interest they had

00:48:45,559 --> 00:48:50,059
regularly meets they they are like many

00:48:48,589 --> 00:48:51,950
people they want to solve the same

00:48:50,059 --> 00:48:54,259
problems that you're the that you

00:48:51,950 --> 00:48:56,690
are wanted to scratch so you have a lot

00:48:54,259 --> 00:48:58,460
of shared background right there and if

00:48:56,690 --> 00:49:00,859
we can make the initiatives these

00:48:58,460 --> 00:49:03,259
supporting groups that support the

00:49:00,859 --> 00:49:04,880
people coming in because they know that

00:49:03,259 --> 00:49:06,469
the people coming in they're going to

00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:08,150
share their problems and they want to

00:49:06,469 --> 00:49:10,940
solve the same issues that they are

00:49:08,150 --> 00:49:13,849
working on and they will mentor those

00:49:10,940 --> 00:49:16,539
people forward from there and search

00:49:13,849 --> 00:49:19,279
them and help them be successful and

00:49:16,539 --> 00:49:21,920
that's a model that we managed to very

00:49:19,279 --> 00:49:24,430
successfully we start the UX initiative

00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:28,700
with so UX addition it was kind of

00:49:24,430 --> 00:49:30,619
non-existent of half a year ago and we

00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:32,450
started it again from scratch and we

00:49:30,619 --> 00:49:34,369
have this model now we have twice weekly

00:49:32,450 --> 00:49:36,859
meetings and we have a lot of new

00:49:34,369 --> 00:49:38,180
contributors coming in of several

00:49:36,859 --> 00:49:40,520
different experience level

00:49:38,180 --> 00:49:42,530
will I came in and redesign the Status

00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:44,390
page randomly it's like yeah cool and

00:49:42,530 --> 00:49:45,710
then we have other random people coming

00:49:44,390 --> 00:49:48,520
in and implementing it and that's also

00:49:45,710 --> 00:49:50,960
cool and we can mentor them through this

00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:54,170
through these tabs and I think if we can

00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:56,390
do the same for other topics like media

00:49:54,170 --> 00:49:58,660
or migrate or a lot of other things then

00:49:56,390 --> 00:50:00,980
then those can be like these small

00:49:58,660 --> 00:50:03,440
comforting groups where you find your

00:50:00,980 --> 00:50:04,820
place and it's not that scary and then

00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:08,210
you can know the people there that can

00:50:04,820 --> 00:50:12,350
support you I agree absolutely you know

00:50:08,210 --> 00:50:15,350
and and I think along with that making

00:50:12,350 --> 00:50:17,870
sure that in some way that that even

00:50:15,350 --> 00:50:20,800
after that work and that initiative is

00:50:17,870 --> 00:50:24,470
done that there continues to be a

00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:26,810
relationship with with the mentor so

00:50:24,470 --> 00:50:28,940
that you know they can continue to

00:50:26,810 --> 00:50:31,100
receive support you know because this is

00:50:28,940 --> 00:50:33,980
this is the thing okay so that gets you

00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:35,810
a little more up the ladder right but it

00:50:33,980 --> 00:50:37,700
gets harder the higher you get and

00:50:35,810 --> 00:50:45,530
that's the more you need the support

00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:48,680
right continuing with the initiative i

00:50:45,530 --> 00:50:52,090
think the mobile initiative that was

00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:54,680
something that i was involved in and

00:50:52,090 --> 00:50:57,950
really agree and chime and that these

00:50:54,680 --> 00:51:00,410
initiatives gave a very easy way to get

00:50:57,950 --> 00:51:03,980
people who had similar interests

00:51:00,410 --> 00:51:05,930
together and at that time i I'm not

00:51:03,980 --> 00:51:08,890
still very closely following the

00:51:05,930 --> 00:51:12,430
initiatives but at that fine time we had

00:51:08,890 --> 00:51:15,710
project managers who were actually

00:51:12,430 --> 00:51:17,480
mentors helping people to connect and

00:51:15,710 --> 00:51:21,020
just recognize the work that was

00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:25,040
happening and I think this was really

00:51:21,020 --> 00:51:27,710
helpful for us and I I though I was not

00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:30,170
a code contributor night and understand

00:51:27,710 --> 00:51:32,320
code I could take away time that was

00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:34,580
very precious from some of the core

00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:36,200
contributors of the initiative and help

00:51:34,580 --> 00:51:38,660
them figure out who should be brought in

00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:41,390
next give encouragement to the newbies

00:51:38,660 --> 00:51:43,550
find them where they were closest to so

00:51:41,390 --> 00:51:45,710
I think there is in the mentoring space

00:51:43,550 --> 00:51:49,340
a lot that we can leverage by bringing

00:51:45,710 --> 00:51:51,560
people who are not necessarily coders

00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:52,010
and programmers who are more in the

00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:54,530
leadership

00:51:52,010 --> 00:51:56,960
roll who've seen and understand the true

00:51:54,530 --> 00:52:00,380
blue community and see how you can

00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:02,480
leverage the understanding of the Drupal

00:52:00,380 --> 00:52:04,940
community and the way it works to build

00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:09,170
these better teams and train those

00:52:04,940 --> 00:52:12,350
skills don't so we've got like one or

00:52:09,170 --> 00:52:14,210
two more minutes so Mike Emma do you

00:52:12,350 --> 00:52:20,620
guys either of you have anything you

00:52:14,210 --> 00:52:22,730
want to like say or ask or no I think a

00:52:20,620 --> 00:52:24,890
lot of ideas we're coming does out of

00:52:22,730 --> 00:52:31,030
this little discussions yeah this is

00:52:24,890 --> 00:52:31,030
