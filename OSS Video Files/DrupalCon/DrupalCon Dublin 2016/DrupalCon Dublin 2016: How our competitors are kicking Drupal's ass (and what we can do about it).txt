Title: DrupalCon Dublin 2016: How our competitors are kicking Drupal's ass (and what we can do about it)
Publication date: 2016-09-27
Playlist: DrupalCon Dublin 2016
Description: 
	More and more people are choosing a CMS based on what their editors want, not just what the IT staff feels is technically sound. The experiences of authors and editors already eclipses the technical foundations of a system for small-to-medium sites, and it may soon for medium-to-large sites too. People are craving an experience that passes the "so easy your CEO can use it" test when it comes to creating and publishing content. We're seeing rich content experience talked about in conversations with our clients, in the features of other CMS systems, and the messages of companies with proprietary alternatives.

Drupal is traditionally a strong technical product that tries to balance the basic needs of authors and editors. We need to do more. This includes innovating in Drupal core to have a better set of tools for content editors built-in, and enable the tools to be extended more broadly through contributed modules.

This talk will present competitive analysis from other CMSes / frameworks and where they’re currently beating Drupal and how we can beat ‘em back. :)

Specifically, focusing on the following:

Authoring and editing for multiple (mobile) devices
Media management and content repositories
Content staging and publish / subscribe models
Page layouts
Authoring tools
The talk will finish with a run-down of the progress of various Drupal 8 initiatives in this space and how to get involved.

	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,930
welcome everyone all right so my name is

00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:09,059
angie byron i also go by web chick on

00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:10,940
the internets and i'm here to talk to

00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:12,990
you a little bit about how our

00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:14,460
competitors are kind of kicking our ass

00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:16,230
a little bit and also what we're gonna

00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:19,140
do about that so this is gonna be a talk

00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:21,960
where I run through I think it's six of

00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:24,359
Drupal's competition in various aspects

00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:26,160
of what we do we'll have some videos

00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:27,660
we'll have some screenshots stuff like

00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,410
that and we can kind of like get exposed

00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,840
to a bunch of these different

00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:33,450
technologies then I'll talk a little bit

00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:35,190
about why that matters and in comparison

00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:37,290
to how Drupal core looks out of the box

00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:38,460
and then we'll kind of end on a positive

00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:40,559
note and we'll talk about all the cool

00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:42,480
stuff that's happening out in the drupal

00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:44,610
8 world today that you can go ahead and

00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,860
get involved with or tear on or whatever

00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:48,469
you'd like to do so that sound good is

00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:53,579
that why everyone is in this room

00:00:48,469 --> 00:00:56,430
great ok so who the heck am I I am a

00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:59,730
core committer for Drupal 8 I'm also a

00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:01,710
Drupal product manager so part of my job

00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:02,850
is to do talks like this that helps

00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:05,430
expose the development community

00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:07,619
primarily to other things out in the

00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:10,979
field I try and help prioritize features

00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:13,500
get them on the roadmap 48.2 8.3 these

00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:15,150
kinds of things and yeah and I worked

00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:19,710
for aqueon and the office of the CTO so

00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:20,939
Drees is my boss no pressure so I want

00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:22,439
to start with a kind of a

00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:25,259
thought-provoking question I know it's

00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:27,509
not like lunchtime yet but but if I were

00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:32,820
to ask you who is Drupal's end user what

00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:39,200
would you guys say drupal consulting

00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:39,200
shops k content editors site builders

00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:45,060
supercalifragilisticexpialidocious i

00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:46,829
didn't quite hear that one yeah so a lot

00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:48,750
of different answers a lot of people

00:01:46,829 --> 00:01:51,960
naturally answer it's people like us

00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:53,610
right by us I mean typically at Drupal

00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:56,759
con Europe in particular there's a lot

00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:58,380
of heavy developer presence here a lot

00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:59,549
of very technical site builders people

00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:01,320
who don't even use the modules page

00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:03,719
because we use dress for everything that

00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:05,430
kind of thing so someone like Neal drum

00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:08,280
at the Drupal Association and you know

00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:09,660
our job is to create and maintain sites

00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,790
make sure they don't go down make sure

00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:13,030
the features are getting deployed on the

00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:15,610
right schedule that the Klein

00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:19,410
needs and and Drupal is for people like

00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:21,610
us but I would argue that Drupal's real

00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:24,490
end-users are the people who are paying

00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:26,319
people like Neil Drum the people who are

00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:28,030
in this like Megan sanic II of the

00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:30,040
Drupal Association because they have a

00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:32,890
job that they have to do and Drupal is

00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:34,840
not that job their job is selling

00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:37,600
products their job is getting

00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,950
memberships their job is you know I

00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:41,380
cufflinks in some kind of a mission

00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:43,810
statement and they need the technology

00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:45,610
to support them in that and by and large

00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:47,560
we're seeing more and more of these

00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:50,080
types of people making the decision on

00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:51,760
what CMS to choose rather than technical

00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,080
people because people kind of figured

00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,850
out that whoever is gonna be kind of the

00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:56,920
victim of the technology that you choose

00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:58,480
should probably have a say and what its

00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:00,790
gonna look like every day and feel like

00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,590
every day I when we talk about content

00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:04,239
authors some of the things that they

00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:06,550
value is they really really value

00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:08,800
ease-of-use simplicity they want it to

00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:10,239
look easy they want it to be easy they

00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,250
want to be able to get up and running in

00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:13,750
a minutes not have to think about it

00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:15,489
they really like it to be well

00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:17,110
integrated so they don't want to have a

00:03:15,489 --> 00:03:18,640
separate login for this a separate login

00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:21,670
for that they want it all to kind of

00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:23,290
feel like one cohesive piece they want

00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:25,180
flexibility they really don't want to

00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:28,660
ever be told no we can't do something

00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:30,340
that sounds very reasonable you know and

00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:31,840
you got to remember that for content

00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:33,160
authors Drupal is not their job it's

00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,290
never going to be their job they don't

00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:36,700
want to know the technology they want to

00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:39,130
understand the technology they want to

00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:40,540
get their job done and whatever that job

00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:44,049
is they want the tech to get out of the

00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:46,680
way and make it easy people generally

00:03:44,049 --> 00:03:50,109
agree with that statement

00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:52,930
nodding okay sweet alright so with that

00:03:50,109 --> 00:03:56,260
background let's get to the contenders

00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:57,970
so there's a lot of different products

00:03:56,260 --> 00:04:00,310
that we could you know talk about here I

00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:01,630
did some asking around a taqueria my

00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:03,760
company cuz we spent a lot of time

00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:06,640
selling Drupal against different things

00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:08,799
and I tried to pick a mix of stuff that

00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,540
was sort of in a few different areas so

00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,850
in the blue circle he'd call this like

00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:15,640
small fries stuff so this is stuff like

00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:18,370
Wix Squarespace Weebly would be another

00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:20,320
one of these tumblr stuff that is very

00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:22,090
down market from Drupal stuff that we're

00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:25,060
not we're not interested in every single

00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:26,260
cat blog using Drupal like that's great

00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:26,860
if they want to but it's a little bit

00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:28,780
you know

00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:31,449
Drupal is more for ambitious projects

00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:33,280
not so much your cat blog on the

00:04:31,449 --> 00:04:35,680
enterprise side you've got site core and

00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,479
Adobe cq5 those are sort of the two that

00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,860
at least we had aqua frequently go

00:04:37,479 --> 00:04:40,810
head-to-head with when we get into a

00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:43,659
competitive arena so we'll talk about

00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:46,150
those and then I wanted to highlight one

00:04:43,659 --> 00:04:48,360
back-end as a service a sort of

00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:50,590
competitor which is called contentful

00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:52,810
work something completely different it

00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:55,030
doesn't look or act like Drupal at all

00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:57,250
but because Drupal ships with a REST API

00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:58,419
and because we're really trying to

00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:00,699
support decoupled and headless

00:04:58,419 --> 00:05:02,379
applications we do end up in a

00:05:00,699 --> 00:05:04,210
competitive space with them as well and

00:05:02,379 --> 00:05:06,400
then I threw WordPress in there because

00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:08,349
everyone knows WordPress or most people

00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,610
know wordpress and wordpress is an

00:05:08,349 --> 00:05:11,469
interesting thing and then it kind of

00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:14,289
straddles all three of those circles and

00:05:11,469 --> 00:05:16,840
how it positions itself so let's start

00:05:14,289 --> 00:05:19,000
with WordPress in each of these I've

00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:20,650
kind of highlighted how these solutions

00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,960
market themselves to people on their

00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:25,120
websites so WordPress touts itself as

00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:28,060
being web software you can use to create

00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,319
beautiful website blog or app so they're

00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:32,770
actually trying to position themselves

00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:35,860
as a valid back-end to create mobile

00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:38,199
applications and things like this they

00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:39,190
currently power about 25% of the web so

00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:41,289
that's sort of their key defining

00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:42,699
feature they're also the only of these

00:05:41,289 --> 00:05:44,349
competitors that I've listed that our

00:05:42,699 --> 00:05:45,789
open source all the rest of them are

00:05:44,349 --> 00:05:48,669
proprietary and so that's a big win for

00:05:45,789 --> 00:05:50,199
them they have a huge community they

00:05:48,669 --> 00:05:52,089
tout a lot of really great advantages

00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:53,949
like their five-minute install media

00:05:52,089 --> 00:05:56,229
management SEO out-of-the-box this kind

00:05:53,949 --> 00:05:59,229
of thing so if people haven't seen

00:05:56,229 --> 00:06:00,940
WordPress this is just a short video

00:05:59,229 --> 00:06:04,479
showing what this looks like so you go

00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:06,699
to create your content just call it my

00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:08,349
blog post you tech blah blah blah they

00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:11,289
have a WYSIWYG editor built in that's

00:06:08,349 --> 00:06:14,979
pretty blog standard when you want to

00:06:11,289 --> 00:06:18,400
add media they have support for things

00:06:14,979 --> 00:06:20,050
like multiple file uploads so I have a

00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,629
lot of pictures of elephants because why

00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:23,770
not and it has a nice little nicely

00:06:22,629 --> 00:06:25,330
designed thing and it shows me a

00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:27,009
progress bar as those go in you can see

00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:28,990
at the top of the tabs they also support

00:06:27,009 --> 00:06:31,240
documents videos audio all

00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:32,740
out-of-the-box all integrated nicely and

00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:34,389
then this is kind of cool when you go to

00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:37,029
insert the images you get kind of like a

00:06:34,389 --> 00:06:39,009
views light interface where you can

00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:40,190
choose to lay those out in a you know

00:06:39,009 --> 00:06:42,350
columns or

00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:44,680
or different types of shapes and stuff

00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:46,820
like that so you know that's pretty cool

00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:48,770
so image gallery support right out of

00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:51,470
the box they support things as well like

00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:54,500
you know putting categories and tags on

00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:56,330
on blog posts it automatically creates a

00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:58,850
nice pretty path it's SEO optimized

00:06:56,330 --> 00:07:01,010
which is really cool you can do things

00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:02,090
like schedule your post to save I

00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:04,400
suppose should come up in a different

00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:05,900
time and then you can either save a

00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:09,080
draft of your thing or you can publish

00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:11,150
it directly and so if you publish it

00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:14,540
directly you can look at it on your site

00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:15,530
and I'm using some like really not cool

00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:17,060
looking thing but they have a lot of

00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:19,220
really nicely designed themes as well

00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:21,200
that you can use so so that's WordPress

00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:23,090
it's really simple if what you're doing

00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:26,210
is publishing content and that's sort of

00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:29,600
what it's there for how many people have

00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:32,150
used WordPress just about everybody yeah

00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:33,620
okay so that was a review but just in

00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:35,750
case people watching the video haven't

00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:37,870
use it that's good the next one I want

00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:40,760
to highlight is a Squarespace

00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:42,140
Squarespace is is definitely down market

00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,370
from Drupal they're trying to get the

00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:45,440
people who have you know want to just

00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:46,880
get a quick website up and running for

00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,690
their restaurants or that kind of a

00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,940
thing

00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:52,490
there there's their whole shtick is they

00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:54,950
are like set your website apart and they

00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:58,340
really focus on well-designed templates

00:07:54,950 --> 00:08:00,710
as a starting point for their solution

00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:02,570
and so any Squarespace site you find

00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:04,300
looks really really nice and that's sort

00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:06,890
of like the brand that they're building

00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:08,180
so lots of do beautifully designed

00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:10,130
templates to choose from you can also

00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:11,510
make design changes directly in the UI

00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:13,690
you can make the font bigger or smaller

00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:17,120
you can change the colors of everything

00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:18,620
and they are proprietary system so you

00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:23,750
get a free trial but then after that you

00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:25,490
have to pay this is kind of a selection

00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:27,710
of the templates that they let you pick

00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:30,560
from so you can use for different use

00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:32,810
cases portfolios blogs musicians etc

00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,849
this is an area that Drupal struggles

00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:37,760
with because Drupal out of the box isn't

00:08:34,849 --> 00:08:40,280
for anything really it's for whatever

00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:42,200
you want it to be and trying to design a

00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:44,330
really nicely design container for

00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:46,310
whatever you want is not quite as easy

00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:48,589
as designing a really good portfolio

00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:50,360
site or a really good restaurant site

00:08:48,589 --> 00:08:53,120
and stuff like that so this is something

00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:53,940
we struggle with a little bit so here is

00:08:53,120 --> 00:09:03,120
the demo video

00:08:53,940 --> 00:09:06,000
from Squarespace so I have lots of apps

00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,980
they call them that add on additional

00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:14,130
functionality just like modules in

00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:18,360
Drupal so by default it gives you a site

00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:19,860
with sample content and then you go

00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:23,430
ahead and start editing it to fit your

00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:28,800
needs and it has live preview you see

00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:30,810
that change right away I've really

00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:33,620
nicely slickly designed media galleries

00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:33,620
things like that

00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:40,170
here's what an example blog post might

00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:42,029
look like and then if you go into design

00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:44,010
mode and start toggling different

00:09:42,029 --> 00:09:45,240
options so you can see they're making

00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:47,310
changes that you would normally have to

00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:53,070
do ask a developer to make write in the

00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:55,670
interface and then you're done

00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:55,670
there's your site

00:09:56,710 --> 00:10:01,000
but we're better than them cuz we're

00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:03,230
eight right now I'm just kidding at me

00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,420
but it's a really nice it's a really

00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:06,800
nice solution and a lot of people get up

00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:08,060
and running with it fast they know that

00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,800
no matter what they do is gonna look

00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:11,270
good you know so it's it's great for

00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:14,810
people who have not a lick of design

00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:16,910
talent in them such as myself Wix is an

00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:18,950
interesting one so Wix was around in

00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:20,990
like the 90s I think I remember it

00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:22,310
having like a dorky little star icon or

00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:24,950
something and I think I played with it

00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:27,980
back then it kind of got awesome like in

00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:30,050
the last 20 years so Wix their motto is

00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:31,400
it starts with your stunning website so

00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:33,560
they have a bunch of predefined

00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:35,330
templates as well it's not quite as like

00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:36,710
crisply designed as Squarespace but it's

00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:39,140
pretty cool

00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:41,210
they're also paid software you know

00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:43,010
between 9 to 26 dollars a month for

00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:45,500
e-commerce event handling this kind of

00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:47,960
thing they have drag and drop they have

00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:49,700
tons of templates tons of apps and they

00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:53,540
include hosting in their solution which

00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:55,790
most of these do here's a few example

00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:57,740
websites that were created using Wix you

00:10:55,790 --> 00:11:00,620
can see that they all again look really

00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:02,930
nice very visually stunning like big

00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:06,830
freakin images this kind of thing going

00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:10,430
on the coolest thing I found is is this

00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:13,400
what do they call it automatic what is

00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:16,130
it I don't remember what this is called

00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:18,290
anyway it's it's like friggin space-age

00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:20,270
stuff here so you answer some questions

00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:21,200
and this wizard and you're like what

00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:23,210
kind of site are you building you're

00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:25,790
like that's like a web portfolio right

00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:27,530
and I want it to have these features and

00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:31,850
you check it off and then what it does

00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:33,830
is it creates the site for you showing

00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:36,080
you what it does so it's sort of like

00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:38,540
both a showcase of what the product does

00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:39,770
and a tutorial at the same time so what

00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:41,600
it does is it says okay you want

00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:43,130
sections like a welcome section and a

00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,200
photo gallery section and it click those

00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:47,000
and then in the right-hand side you see

00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:49,070
your home page being built out right

00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,550
before you with all the sample content

00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:53,720
in there it's pretty cool this goes on

00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:56,990
for a while but they have things like

00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:58,250
forms they have things like you know

00:11:56,990 --> 00:12:00,140
different aspects and things that you

00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:01,880
can do and so it's a really neat way I

00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:03,590
thought like more so than a tour because

00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:05,630
Ettore I feel like manually click and

00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:07,250
it's super irritating this it's just

00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:08,570
showing you something to look at while

00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:09,459
it's doing the process of building your

00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:11,529
site but in the process

00:12:09,459 --> 00:12:13,300
you actually learn what the software

00:12:11,529 --> 00:12:14,829
does and how to use it in this kind of

00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:18,279
thing so I thought that was kind of

00:12:14,829 --> 00:12:22,629
interesting all right so let's get to

00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:23,800
the enterprise stuff so the first one of

00:12:22,629 --> 00:12:28,300
these I wanted to highlight is one

00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:29,949
called site core by the way I forgot to

00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:33,670
ask my questions how many people have

00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:37,509
used Squarespace before a lot fewer

00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:41,860
maybe maybe 15 people

00:12:37,509 --> 00:12:44,410
how about Wix about the same different

00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:45,759
people though interesting and how many

00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:48,879
have heard of site core or have used

00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:50,619
that quite a few interesting cuz I

00:12:48,879 --> 00:12:53,350
didn't know in what site core was before

00:12:50,619 --> 00:12:56,019
I started working at on quia so site

00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:58,360
core bills itself as the only integrated

00:12:56,019 --> 00:13:00,369
experience management platform content

00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:02,290
data and delivery in one so I would like

00:13:00,369 --> 00:13:04,240
to give them kudos for squeezing so many

00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:05,740
buzzwords into a simple sentence that

00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,720
was really well done

00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:09,309
so their whole shtick is they're both a

00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:11,199
web content management platform just

00:13:09,309 --> 00:13:12,519
like Drupal is but they're also a

00:13:11,199 --> 00:13:14,589
marketing platform and they actually

00:13:12,519 --> 00:13:16,480
build themselves or they they target

00:13:14,589 --> 00:13:18,429
themselves tourism marketers and I have

00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:21,220
a super creepy video in a second that

00:13:18,429 --> 00:13:23,319
will show you all about that another

00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:25,240
advantage is that site core has over

00:13:23,319 --> 00:13:27,129
Drupal in some areas is it's all dotnet

00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:28,569
based and the whole thing really looks

00:13:27,129 --> 00:13:30,939
and feels like a Microsoft Office

00:13:28,569 --> 00:13:32,740
application almost and that makes it

00:13:30,939 --> 00:13:34,779
really comfortable to people who are

00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:37,299
Microsoft shops or have a lot of people

00:13:34,779 --> 00:13:39,490
who know Microsoft technology or

00:13:37,299 --> 00:13:42,129
Microsoft applications it fits in pretty

00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:44,259
well with their stack and the price on

00:13:42,129 --> 00:13:47,079
that is one arm and one leg I checked

00:13:44,259 --> 00:13:49,720
that's yeah so let's take a look at

00:13:47,079 --> 00:13:52,209
website core does this is done by

00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:54,910
selecting the Home tab then clicking

00:13:52,209 --> 00:13:56,889
insert page so this is a long video I'm

00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:59,679
not going to show that I select the

00:13:56,889 --> 00:14:02,559
traveler story item I'm going to name

00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:04,929
the page site core cycling holiday and

00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:08,410
so ok a couple things I highlight here

00:14:04,929 --> 00:14:12,579
is site core for a second oops site core

00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:14,290
is a page centric CMS so it talks a lot

00:14:12,579 --> 00:14:15,879
about pages and pages and Squarespace

00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:17,620
does the same thing but something that's

00:14:15,879 --> 00:14:19,689
interesting about Squarespace is like us

00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:22,209
they store their content as sort of like

00:14:19,689 --> 00:14:22,750
abstract objects and so you can mix and

00:14:22,209 --> 00:14:24,490
match and

00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:25,810
them in different contexts even though

00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:29,200
their pages their pages are effectively

00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:31,780
containers for their content so this is

00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:36,160
done by selecting the Home tab then

00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:37,630
clicking insert page oh let me try that

00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:40,120
one more time I'm very sorry this is

00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:44,380
done by selecting the Home tab then

00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:47,380
clicking insert page in the dialog

00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:50,110
I select the travelers story item so

00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:53,440
family story site course cycling holiday

00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:56,260
is effectively a content type so it's

00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:58,420
there's no context of the election cycle

00:14:56,260 --> 00:15:01,050
has automatically created the new news

00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:03,640
item assigned an SEO friendly URL

00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:07,090
generated a relevant breadcrumb entry

00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:08,830
and so it starts it off with a new

00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:10,870
traffic light I can now modify the

00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:14,170
content of the new item using the

00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:16,570
on-page and inline editing provided by

00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:18,070
the experience editor so in-place

00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:20,800
editing when clicking the editable

00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:24,670
object for the text field it activates a

00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:27,250
floating toolbar I'm first going to show

00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:30,790
how to do inline editing by simply

00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:32,500
entering I can do inline editing to do

00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:34,510
more advanced editing I will need to use

00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:37,830
the text editor this is done by clicking

00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:43,480
the page icon in the floating toolbar

00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:46,810
and he goes on for a while but so the

00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:48,670
key things to take away here are you

00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:51,370
know sitecore also uses structured

00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:52,720
content they also ship with things like

00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:54,670
in-place editing which triple-eight does

00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:58,390
now as well which is nice you can edit

00:15:54,670 --> 00:16:00,070
things right immediately there here he's

00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:01,540
going to insert a link and this is kind

00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:04,780
of interesting how it does that I also

00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:06,970
want to insert an internal link this is

00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:10,150
done by selecting text editor then

00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:12,010
clicking the insert site calling for now

00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:15,310
I'm just going to select the home page

00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:19,030
located at site core and content and

00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:20,710
cycle cycling holidays in home so just

00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:22,420
like a regular directory structure it

00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:25,060
shows you a hierarchy and you can click

00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:26,950
on find changes so I click accept I

00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:30,490
supposed to copy and pasting node slash

00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:33,160
for my page I want to insert a page

00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:36,760
image this is done by clicking the page

00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:39,670
image icon in the floating toolbar so

00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:41,680
choose an image this is the media

00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:44,139
library I'm going to change to a tree

00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:46,440
view as I find it easier to navigate so

00:16:44,139 --> 00:16:49,300
once again we're very focused on files

00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:51,610
holders things that make sense okay use

00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:54,959
media library base core widgets in

00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:58,570
summary images Battle of the hills 0 1

00:16:54,959 --> 00:17:02,110
click select I'm now verifying my

00:16:58,570 --> 00:17:05,439
changes I'm going in there singing media

00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:07,600
slave icon before moving away from my

00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:09,130
page I want to add a component in the

00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:11,860
right column which is one of the

00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:13,689
designing functionalities when clicking

00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:16,240
the gray area in the right column a

00:17:13,689 --> 00:17:18,010
little floating toolbar will appear but

00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:20,650
the floating toolbar thing comes from

00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:23,470
Microsoft Word will also appear is a

00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:26,410
little placeholder saying at here I'm

00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:28,900
going to click the placeholder in the

00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:30,280
select a rendering dialog we are

00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:32,140
presented with all the different

00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:34,570
components that we can add to this

00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:36,130
specific placeholder again content types

00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:39,059
I'm going to select the traveler quote

00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:42,100
component then click the select button

00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:44,350
in the next dialog I have the option to

00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:46,630
reuse some content by selecting an

00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:48,549
existing quote search for content or

00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:50,380
create a new content for this

00:17:48,549 --> 00:17:52,780
demonstration I'm going to select the

00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:54,880
Amanda Jones item and click OK

00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:57,370
so effectively an enemy reference quote

00:17:54,880 --> 00:18:00,040
is appearing on the page and the toolbar

00:17:57,370 --> 00:18:01,960
looks slightly different the toolbar

00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:05,470
will allow me to move or associate a

00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:07,660
content item with this component test or

00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:10,150
delete the component or do a couple of

00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:14,470
other things this is all related to

00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:17,140
design mode so when I saw this demo it's

00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:19,299
kind of like why is psycorps and a

00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:20,799
competitor because it's like that kind

00:18:19,299 --> 00:18:22,059
of looks awful to me I don't know like

00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:23,380
it's like it's cool that you see your

00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:25,030
whole site the way it's meant to look

00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:27,280
and the toolbar is up here but it's like

00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:29,470
but Drupal can do all of that and I

00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:31,990
didn't really understand what the big

00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:38,350
deal was with site core and the big deal

00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:38,910
it turns out is this thing sorry oh come

00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:41,910
back

00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:41,910
hmmm

00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:52,450
give me a moment here go to page so um

00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:54,130
so that's a CMS like a lot of CMS as

00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:55,450
you've probably seen but this is what is

00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:57,490
on the home page of site core and how

00:18:55,450 --> 00:19:01,930
they market themselves which I thought

00:18:57,490 --> 00:19:07,450
was pretty interesting empowering you to

00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:12,280
market in context hi oh that was

00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:15,280
short-lived the site core experience

00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:18,580
platform empowering you to market in

00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:21,100
context hi I'm Brian head of marketing

00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:23,050
and a de jure apparel in our business as

00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:25,720
in any business the way you treat your

00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:27,730
customers says a lot about your brand so

00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:30,100
our marketing team uses the site core

00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:32,500
experience platform to manage all of our

00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:35,080
customers digital interactions with site

00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:37,630
core we mark it in context to each of

00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:39,760
our customers individual behaviors so

00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:43,810
their experience is more personal and

00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:46,630
relevant so a lot of enemies in this is

00:19:43,810 --> 00:19:48,820
Kim two weeks ago we only knew her as an

00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:51,220
anonymous visitor to our website but her

00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:52,510
online activity matched our profile for

00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:55,780
an active mother

00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:57,520
that's context it's an online ad for a

00:19:55,780 --> 00:20:00,070
new line of shoes we gathered even more

00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:01,990
contextual intelligence on her and when

00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:03,880
Kim signed up for our email alerts last

00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:05,860
week we finally learned her name and

00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:07,920
email address and more importantly a

00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:09,760
beginning to build a profile for her

00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:11,950
meanwhile we tested three different

00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:14,410
email promotions featuring belts to

00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:15,940
those customers who might like them Kim

00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:17,380
received one of those emails and

00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:19,420
couldn't resist clicking through and

00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:22,030
making a purchase who played early when

00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:24,310
Kim is near one of our stores Sitecore

00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:26,470
presents her a location-based offer for

00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:28,450
an in-store discount that offer features

00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:30,220
a new line of boots we are pretty

00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:32,530
confident she would like because of her

00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:34,690
past actions and when Asher's retail

00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:37,120
clerks scans the coupon on Kim's mobile

00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:39,640
phone sitecore enables her to recommend

00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:42,820
another product a child's backpack based

00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:43,780
on Kim's active mother profile Kim is

00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:46,300
impressed

00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:48,550
Azure clearly understands her specific

00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:51,550
interest because Sitecore tracks the

00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:54,440
paths of her interaction so she joins

00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:56,090
our loyalty program to get sneak peeks

00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:58,070
coming products tomorrow we will

00:20:56,090 --> 00:21:00,259
continue Kim's journey inviting her to

00:20:58,070 --> 00:21:02,389
download our new mobile app since we've

00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:04,700
learned she accesses our site most often

00:21:02,389 --> 00:21:07,279
through her smartphone using site core

00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:08,960
to market in context as your apparel

00:21:07,279 --> 00:21:11,480
gains a deeper understanding of our

00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:15,379
customer and that makes their experience

00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:17,929
pretty awesome with over 4,500 satisfied

00:21:15,379 --> 00:21:20,330
customers site core empowers marketers

00:21:17,929 --> 00:21:27,740
to own the experience by marketing in

00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:29,539
context so that's creepy and I'm so sure

00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:30,980
Karen really appreciates being sold

00:21:29,539 --> 00:21:32,990
other crap that she didn't go in there

00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:34,909
to buy but you know like apparently in

00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:37,669
marketing land you do so that's why

00:21:34,909 --> 00:21:39,980
people like site core a lot because it

00:21:37,669 --> 00:21:41,389
lets marketing people do their jobs

00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:42,919
really well I mean that's what marketing

00:21:41,389 --> 00:21:44,899
people are for there's to try and

00:21:42,919 --> 00:21:46,669
analyze the behavior of people and

00:21:44,899 --> 00:21:48,379
figure out how it all goes together so

00:21:46,669 --> 00:21:49,759
they have a lot of personalization

00:21:48,379 --> 00:21:52,490
features so they can do things like

00:21:49,759 --> 00:21:54,500
track what search engine query you came

00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:55,940
in with and adjust the page accordingly

00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:58,309
they can track what products you're

00:21:55,940 --> 00:22:00,500
clicking on and then say oh you seem to

00:21:58,309 --> 00:22:02,539
like you know toast a lot we're gonna

00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:05,870
make the whole homepage about bread or

00:22:02,539 --> 00:22:07,610
whatever this kind of thing so anyway so

00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:10,039
injury's is pushing things like you know

00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:12,500
the cci initiative and things like that

00:22:10,039 --> 00:22:13,909
it's to help balance out things like

00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:15,500
this because right now these platforms

00:22:13,909 --> 00:22:17,659
exist and it's not like they're not

00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:20,529
without use they're kind of creepy when

00:22:17,659 --> 00:22:22,490
used in a you know like a ecommerce

00:22:20,529 --> 00:22:24,740
transaction kind of thing but if it were

00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:26,629
used in a you know conversion to donate

00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:28,700
to the ACLU or something for example you

00:22:26,629 --> 00:22:31,070
know maybe that's different but but

00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:32,120
right now they're all proprietary and it

00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:33,320
would be cool if there was at least an

00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:36,820
open-source option I think it's the

00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:41,779
thinking there so so that's sitecore

00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:42,529
Adobe so Adobe its price is your

00:22:41,779 --> 00:22:44,000
firstborn

00:22:42,529 --> 00:22:45,830
so not just an arm and a leg now you're

00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,289
gonna need to give the whole thing so

00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:50,929
Adobe's thing is make delivering great

00:22:48,289 --> 00:22:54,200
digital experiences look easy

00:22:50,929 --> 00:22:56,330
Adobe's whole shtick is they have they

00:22:54,200 --> 00:23:00,049
own all the things they own Photoshop

00:22:56,330 --> 00:23:02,990
and Premiere and PDF and all this kind

00:23:00,049 --> 00:23:05,379
of stuff and so they're CMS integrates

00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:08,340
really really well with all of that and

00:23:05,379 --> 00:23:09,720
it's great for teams that have like

00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:11,929
a lot of artists and you know digital

00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:15,870
artists that kind of thing on the team

00:23:11,929 --> 00:23:18,179
it is good and bad for them we

00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:20,070
definitely heard the complaint from

00:23:18,179 --> 00:23:21,960
people that Adobe basically wants you to

00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:23,610
be all on this stuff so they want you to

00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:25,380
use their analytics package and they're

00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:27,570
creepy targeting thing and they're this

00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:29,700
thisthis thisthis versus one of the key

00:23:27,570 --> 00:23:32,549
advantages of Drupal is that you can use

00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:34,320
our CMS and somebody else's analytics

00:23:32,549 --> 00:23:35,789
software and somebody else's this and it

00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:38,010
all integrates together into one

00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:40,470
platform so that's kind of a key

00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:41,970
differentiator that Drupal has but but

00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:44,010
yeah so they have a whole bunch of stuff

00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:45,630
here there's a lot of videos I could

00:23:44,010 --> 00:23:48,360
show but I picked this one because it

00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:50,820
talks about the asset handling stuff and

00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:52,260
it gets into some cool interactions that

00:23:50,820 --> 00:24:06,690
you can do because of the Creative Cloud

00:23:52,260 --> 00:24:09,179
things so AEM assets is a very friendly

00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:11,940
environment for non-technical marketers

00:24:09,179 --> 00:24:14,970
they'd rather spend their time marketing

00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:17,279
than figuring out how to make interfaces

00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:19,380
work the intuitive interface we've

00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:21,870
brought forth with a EMSs with

00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:24,419
checkboxes drop-down menus dragging and

00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:27,690
dropping make it easier for you to get

00:24:24,419 --> 00:24:30,029
the job done as fast as possible

00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:32,220
ayyyy MSS is a part of the adobe

00:24:30,029 --> 00:24:33,870
experience manager solution which is a

00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:36,840
part of the marketing cloud it allows

00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:39,269
our customers to have a best in breed

00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:42,600
digital asset management system with

00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:45,059
rich media delivery as well as workflows

00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:48,000
for creatives meaning internal

00:24:45,059 --> 00:24:50,490
departments external agencies providing

00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,740
a seamless workflow for moving assets

00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:56,970
from the creative concept into marketing

00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:59,549
campaigns we're able to connect the

00:24:56,970 --> 00:25:01,529
workflow of a creative professional

00:24:59,549 --> 00:25:04,710
right into the appropriate project

00:25:01,529 --> 00:25:07,080
directory of the enterprise class assets

00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:08,610
so that the marketer can start getting

00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:11,159
those assets out in front of the

00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:13,810
customers in campaigns much more quickly

00:25:11,159 --> 00:25:16,550
than before

00:25:13,810 --> 00:25:19,540
assets are never standalone you need to

00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:22,370
be able to deliver those assets in

00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:26,030
multiple environments maybe for just

00:25:22,370 --> 00:25:29,090
your apps or for use on mobile web so

00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:31,040
you have to be very agile if you're

00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:33,860
dealing with a hundred images from one

00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:36,590
photographer 200 from another and you're

00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:40,190
planning campaigns around spring summer

00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:43,370
fall you need to be able to manage that

00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:45,290
content in batch mode so if you have a

00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:48,530
system that can handle this through

00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:51,650
simple tagging powerful searches access

00:25:48,530 --> 00:25:54,020
to certain groups to certain collections

00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:56,780
it saves time for everyone involved

00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:58,940
these are the types of things that are

00:25:56,780 --> 00:26:02,990
very very important when you're dealing

00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:06,679
with assets at an enterprise scale

00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:10,280
this is video today is as important if

00:26:06,679 --> 00:26:12,200
not more than images shoppable media is

00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:15,050
a very exciting new capability that

00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:17,300
allows for our marketers to put hot

00:26:15,050 --> 00:26:19,940
spots on top of videos so somebody's

00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:22,520
shopping on the website can see a model

00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:25,010
wearing a specific sweater click on that

00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:27,020
and immediately see the product that

00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:29,990
refers to the SKU the price the colors

00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:34,580
and sizes it comes in very exciting very

00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:37,160
engaging because the experience you

00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:40,130
provide to your customers reflects so

00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:43,100
strongly on your brand you need to

00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:45,590
ensure you provide engaging assets with

00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:47,730
content at the right time on the right

00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:50,220
device

00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:52,559
so you notice in their marketing they

00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:54,690
have a lot of screams a lot of shots of

00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:56,490
like tablets and mobile phones and all

00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:58,710
this kind of stuff this is a big area of

00:26:56,490 --> 00:27:01,169
differentiation for them they also had

00:26:58,710 --> 00:27:04,279
the ability to create responsive grid

00:27:01,169 --> 00:27:07,440
layouts right in the UI without any code

00:27:04,279 --> 00:27:09,179
the fact that they can do hotspots and

00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,559
video means like at some point you could

00:27:09,179 --> 00:27:12,690
download Game of Thrones and buy the

00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:15,059
crown that Daenerys is wearing why not

00:27:12,690 --> 00:27:17,190
just click it anyway but I thought that

00:27:15,059 --> 00:27:20,100
was kind of interesting how they can do

00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:22,649
those kinds of things but yeah so adobe

00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:24,720
experience manager that's that's another

00:27:22,649 --> 00:27:26,490
one that one at least is really nicely

00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,960
designed like it's easy to see why that

00:27:26,490 --> 00:27:30,389
would be really nice to work with it

00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:33,299
looks really cool it feels nice that

00:27:30,389 --> 00:27:35,039
kind of thing so yeah so that's kind of

00:27:33,299 --> 00:27:36,720
the the comparator going to run through

00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:39,690
and then for something completely

00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:41,220
different than that backhand as a

00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:43,110
service so let's talk about this one

00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:44,370
this one's called contentful there's a

00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:47,190
bunch of these there's Prisma Keio

00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:50,159
there's some other ones they're kind of

00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:52,830
there their motto is it's like a CMS but

00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:55,980
without the bad bits and so what does

00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:59,460
that mean essentially they focus only on

00:27:55,980 --> 00:28:01,950
the content creation and modeling so

00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:03,360
they have a C CK like thing where they

00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:05,669
can create different fields and this

00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:07,830
kind of thing and then the only display

00:28:05,669 --> 00:28:10,649
of that information is by an API and

00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:12,720
comes out in JSON which is great if you

00:28:10,649 --> 00:28:14,970
want to completely throw out anything

00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:17,580
that a CMS would do for you regarding

00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:19,230
templating or I don't know accessibility

00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:21,450
things like that and you want to write

00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:24,510
your whole application from scratch in

00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:26,730
react or you know whatever solution that

00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:28,230
you're looking for so people really like

00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:30,299
it for building decoupled applications

00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:31,710
basically and this one is free for a

00:28:30,299 --> 00:28:35,220
limited plan and then you need to pay

00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:37,380
between 99 and $200 a month for extra

00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:40,889
users or constant I think the initial

00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:43,350
one only gets you like three admins and

00:28:40,889 --> 00:28:44,669
like maybe a thousand queries or

00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:46,940
something like that it's pretty limited

00:28:44,669 --> 00:28:50,789
but it's useful for getting started so

00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:52,620
so this is what it looks like so we're

00:28:50,789 --> 00:28:54,240
in the content modeling view at the

00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:55,950
moment I'm just looking at their sample

00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:57,629
products you can see it has a bunch of

00:28:55,950 --> 00:29:00,240
different fields like size type color

00:28:57,629 --> 00:29:01,380
you can add a new field so they have

00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:03,480
things like location

00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:05,010
numbers this kind of stuff and then if

00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:07,860
you actually look at a piece of content

00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:09,810
and go in there to edit it it's it's

00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:11,670
nice but it's like very bare-bones like

00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:14,820
their WYSIWYG editor actually generates

00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:16,800
markdown like it's very bare-bones and

00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:18,930
when you view it it just looks like you

00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:21,360
know a list of properties effectively

00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:23,370
and so you're like well grace we don't

00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:25,380
have to worry about them because we have

00:29:23,370 --> 00:29:27,780
an actual WYSIWYG editor and in place

00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:29,580
editing and we all this stuff but the

00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:31,110
reason they're billing it like that is

00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:34,320
because the real thing they want you to

00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:38,190
interact with is the command line so

00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:40,650
here they're writing a curl request to

00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:43,470
the contentful API pulling back all the

00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:45,090
content types of book and then you see

00:29:43,470 --> 00:29:46,860
like a list of JSON which says there's a

00:29:45,090 --> 00:29:49,980
total of two and it's really nicely

00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:51,930
pruned JSON like Drupal right now kind

00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:53,190
of just blue barfs everything you could

00:29:51,930 --> 00:29:56,520
possibly want to know about an entity

00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:58,830
including that it's called an entity out

00:29:56,520 --> 00:30:00,510
in your face and so they've done a

00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:02,640
really good job of like curating that

00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:04,200
and having you know just the content

00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:06,540
that you need and not more kind of thing

00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:08,790
and they also have SDKs for pretty much

00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:10,940
any language Under the Sun so it's nice

00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:13,800
if you're a ruby developer or you're a

00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:16,110
god fretted a Perl developer I'm just

00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:17,790
kidding but that you know different you

00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:20,040
know mobile apps this kind of thing all

00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:21,960
have SDKs you just block right into

00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:24,950
their api's and this is something that

00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:28,170
Drupal doesn't have today at the moment

00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:30,240
so that's what I wanted to say about our

00:30:28,170 --> 00:30:32,900
competitors I'm gonna pause here to see

00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:35,910
if people have questions or comments or

00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:37,380
things of that nature and I want to cost

00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:39,360
of like I'm giving you a really broad

00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:41,280
overview I'm hoping I can do a talk kind

00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:43,170
of like this a different time maybe go

00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:44,670
through each of the initiatives and do

00:30:43,170 --> 00:30:46,200
like a really detailed comparison of

00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:48,060
media solutions in each one and stuff

00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:50,100
like that but I kind of wanted to just

00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:52,280
expose people to what these competitors

00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:57,480
do and what they're generally good at

00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:59,820
yes what kind of people are using

00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:02,310
contentful um hipster JavaScript

00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:05,010
developers predominantly people and

00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:06,930
they're like Millennials damn it no but

00:31:05,010 --> 00:31:10,680
yes typically it's it's definitely a

00:31:06,930 --> 00:31:13,110
developer centric audience so it's it's

00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:14,279
a situation where an organization has an

00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:16,649
IT department

00:31:14,279 --> 00:31:18,719
and the marketers don't care how it gets

00:31:16,649 --> 00:31:20,609
built they just want it to work to this

00:31:18,719 --> 00:31:22,109
specification so they build the

00:31:20,609 --> 00:31:23,789
completely custom front end and whatever

00:31:22,109 --> 00:31:26,519
javascript framework of the week is

00:31:23,789 --> 00:31:30,029
popular and then they go to the back end

00:31:26,519 --> 00:31:31,109
in order to retrieve and push content so

00:31:30,029 --> 00:31:32,749
it's written for people who want to

00:31:31,109 --> 00:31:35,369
write completely custom bespoke

00:31:32,749 --> 00:31:38,700
applications that do exactly what they

00:31:35,369 --> 00:31:41,399
want and then they just use the CMS part

00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:44,219
as like a basic data entry you know for

00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:46,229
for basically the the point of

00:31:44,219 --> 00:31:47,969
contentful they offer a UI for it but

00:31:46,229 --> 00:31:49,469
the point of it is the API to work back

00:31:47,969 --> 00:31:52,129
and forth with it so so that's a good

00:31:49,469 --> 00:31:52,129
question yeah

00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:10,389
so he said he asked is it is it more

00:32:08,919 --> 00:32:11,620
larger organizations or smaller

00:32:10,389 --> 00:32:12,880
organizations that we use something like

00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:14,799
contentful versus something like

00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:16,990
Squarespace or thing I think it would be

00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:18,610
much larger organizations because even

00:32:16,990 --> 00:32:20,110
the monthly price is much higher it's

00:32:18,610 --> 00:32:21,490
like I think Squarespace starts at 11

00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:25,090
bucks a month or something like that and

00:32:21,490 --> 00:32:27,370
Wix is free if you want ads versus

00:32:25,090 --> 00:32:29,649
contentful their first real package is

00:32:27,370 --> 00:32:32,230
about 99 a month so it's really for

00:32:29,649 --> 00:32:33,669
organizations like you know like we work

00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:34,870
with a lot of large media companies and

00:32:33,669 --> 00:32:37,029
large media companies have their own

00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:38,409
development teams it's for it's for that

00:32:37,029 --> 00:32:39,880
kind of a situation where you have a

00:32:38,409 --> 00:32:41,830
development team and they want to build

00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:44,230
something that they know how to maintain

00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:46,750
and they don't have the patience to be

00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:48,490
debugging Y views did that error that it

00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:50,019
did you know cuz I don't need views I

00:32:48,490 --> 00:32:52,000
can write my own or you know like that

00:32:50,019 --> 00:32:54,279
kind of thing so it's more for that I it

00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,870
you could if you're a scrappy nonprofit

00:32:54,279 --> 00:32:57,399
with one developer also do it but

00:32:55,870 --> 00:33:00,070
typically a scrappy nonprofits gonna

00:32:57,399 --> 00:33:01,450
choose some off-the-shelf thing or an

00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:04,090
open source solution like Drupal because

00:33:01,450 --> 00:33:05,950
it it you know it handles so much for

00:33:04,090 --> 00:33:08,080
them and they usually don't have the

00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:10,720
resources to pay a development team to

00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:12,159
maintain their CMS effectively their

00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:14,460
custom means he must I saw a hand back

00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:14,460
yeah

00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:31,320
yeah so the question is um is how is

00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:35,880
Drupal doing against those those

00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:37,320
enterprise software correct Drupal it's

00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:40,620
interesting to Polly has a lot more

00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:42,620
market share of the like Fortune 1000

00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:46,380
kind of sites than these do and and

00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:48,390
they're like all the site core stuff is

00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:49,740
all like open source is so terrible the

00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:51,480
total cost of ownership

00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:52,830
right I mean they're there yeah they

00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:55,980
don't like open source like that's a

00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:58,470
huge threat to them in the Gartner Magic

00:33:55,980 --> 00:34:00,780
Quadrant and the Forrester wave and

00:33:58,470 --> 00:34:02,910
those kinds of things which people who

00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:05,760
pay ridiculous amounts of money for

00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:08,220
software care about Adobe is usually

00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:09,870
listed as the leader like they're far

00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:12,750
and ahead of the pack just because of

00:34:09,870 --> 00:34:18,690
like nom being and then I think Acquia

00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:20,760
is listed as up-and-comer I don't

00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:22,110
remember exactly I could figure this out

00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:24,810
there's a new one of those gonna come

00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:26,580
out like next week or something but yeah

00:34:24,810 --> 00:34:28,230
so it's it's basically those three that

00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:30,870
end up in all the deals it's like Adobe

00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:33,899
site core and and more more frequently

00:34:30,870 --> 00:34:36,210
lately use Drupal a lot of times that

00:34:33,899 --> 00:34:37,530
the the trick to get in there though is

00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:39,720
you have to get in through the agencies

00:34:37,530 --> 00:34:41,460
because agencies like huge system

00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:43,169
integrators are who's working with these

00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:44,520
large companies and they're they don't

00:34:43,169 --> 00:34:46,230
they're just gonna work with whoever

00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:48,720
their agency partner is just like

00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:50,280
Capgemini or its you know whoever if

00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:52,050
they don't use Drupal then these

00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:53,399
companies are not gonna use Drupal so

00:34:52,050 --> 00:34:56,550
there's been a lot of work to try and

00:34:53,399 --> 00:34:58,140
get triple infiltrated into these you

00:34:56,550 --> 00:35:00,390
know large agencies so that these

00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:02,430
customers that that consult purely with

00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:05,430
large agencies can have Interpol on the

00:35:02,430 --> 00:35:07,950
table as an option but yeah it's

00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:11,220
definitely I'd say over the past like

00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:12,870
three years it's definitely changed

00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:14,010
dramatically and like I don't know if

00:35:12,870 --> 00:35:16,200
you heard that in the psycorps video

00:35:14,010 --> 00:35:17,730
they said we have 3,500 customers or

00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:21,180
something like that it's like Drupal has

00:35:17,730 --> 00:35:23,940
way more than 3,500 customers so market

00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:25,740
share wise we do really well but you

00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:27,900
know when those when those you know

00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:30,540
things get set in there you know and

00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:32,370
Adobe just demos really really well you

00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:33,690
know and so that's a lot of times kind

00:35:32,370 --> 00:35:35,340
of the struggle that Drupal has is

00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:37,290
especially out of the box it doesn't

00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:40,080
look super awesome which is what the

00:35:37,290 --> 00:35:41,130
next part of this talk is about so maybe

00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:42,210
I'll jump into that

00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:44,310
and then we'll have more time for

00:35:42,210 --> 00:35:46,140
questions at the end so I just showed

00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:49,500
you a bunch of really pretty things and

00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:51,150
like whoo so let's look at how Drupal

00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:53,430
and I emphasize this is Drupal core

00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:55,500
because I'm comparing apples to apples

00:35:53,430 --> 00:35:57,510
out of the box experiences of each one

00:35:55,500 --> 00:36:00,030
of these things so let's take a look at

00:35:57,510 --> 00:36:01,620
how Drupal core fares against these

00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:07,050
other competitors mm-hmm

00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:09,450
so our sample content is screw you so

00:36:07,050 --> 00:36:13,020
there's nothing that would guide you to

00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:15,690
what Drupal is how it works what it's

00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:18,900
capable of anything like that an image

00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:20,970
who uses images you know and there's

00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:23,520
good reason for this I mean we we we

00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:25,560
develop Drupal as a generic framework

00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:27,420
that could do anything right and so we

00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:29,400
didn't want to be opinionated about well

00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:30,840
Drupal out of the box is you know for

00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:32,250
blogs because that would you know kind

00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:34,140
of shoehorn it and being a blogging

00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:35,460
platform it's definitely not that you

00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:37,860
know and and so we've gone back and

00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:39,270
forth a lot of this to try and figure

00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:41,850
out how we could solve this problem

00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:43,170
because a lot of people we've seen this

00:36:41,850 --> 00:36:44,370
in the field they they go into Drupal

00:36:43,170 --> 00:36:46,320
and they're putting it up against

00:36:44,370 --> 00:36:47,310
WordPress or what I have you and they

00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:49,860
come away with the impression that

00:36:47,310 --> 00:36:51,780
Drupal is limited in functionality and

00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:53,790
not flexible which is like the exact

00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:56,310
opposite of what oopall actually is

00:36:53,790 --> 00:36:58,050
that's bad when people aren't picking

00:36:56,310 --> 00:36:59,700
duple because they can't figure it out

00:36:58,050 --> 00:37:04,560
in five minutes like they can the other

00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:07,620
things here's our media experience so

00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:10,020
you get a little dialogue that lets you

00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:12,810
upload an image from your hard drive you

00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:14,720
can't add an external image you can't

00:37:12,810 --> 00:37:17,610
pick from an image you already uploaded

00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:20,850
can't multi upload images any of that

00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:23,010
stuff and then if you want a media

00:37:20,850 --> 00:37:25,920
library we have one out of the box it

00:37:23,010 --> 00:37:27,510
looks like this it's just a view that

00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:29,330
lists the file name there's no

00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:31,590
thumbnails there's nothing like that

00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:34,530
again this is all out-of-the-box there's

00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:36,990
lots of awesome modules media module you

00:37:34,530 --> 00:37:38,220
know file entity file browser all these

00:37:36,990 --> 00:37:40,050
kinds of things they're they're great

00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:41,700
they're fantastic but you have to know

00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:43,260
that they exist if you don't know they

00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:46,440
exist and this is the impression you get

00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:47,520
a Drupal here's our theme selector so

00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:51,510
Drupal ships with a whopping three

00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:53,039
themes one of which is blank and doesn't

00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:55,529
look like anything

00:37:53,039 --> 00:37:59,669
it was just cool and then if you want to

00:37:55,529 --> 00:38:01,919
add a new one you get this screen where

00:37:59,669 --> 00:38:03,900
you're asked to go copy a URL from

00:38:01,919 --> 00:38:07,140
somewhere and paste it into a box

00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:09,059
there's no visual nice like wow look at

00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:10,469
these super cool themes and I'm so

00:38:09,059 --> 00:38:12,329
pretty and I could totally see my

00:38:10,469 --> 00:38:14,489
restaurant looking like that like none

00:38:12,329 --> 00:38:16,469
of that like so it's a really big

00:38:14,489 --> 00:38:17,579
barrier to entry for design oriented

00:38:16,469 --> 00:38:19,410
people because they don't want their

00:38:17,579 --> 00:38:21,089
website to look like crap and they see

00:38:19,410 --> 00:38:22,859
Squarespace and they see Wix is like wow

00:38:21,089 --> 00:38:24,779
my website does look like that I could

00:38:22,859 --> 00:38:29,069
have that cool Thai restaurant with the

00:38:24,779 --> 00:38:31,349
flamey things yeah I want that and then

00:38:29,069 --> 00:38:32,009
at least in core again our layouts are

00:38:31,349 --> 00:38:34,469
hard-coded

00:38:32,009 --> 00:38:36,150
so the theme determines what lit what

00:38:34,469 --> 00:38:38,849
regions you have available and what

00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:40,499
layout that they go in there is nothing

00:38:38,849 --> 00:38:41,789
like drag-and-drop a mini content you

00:38:40,499 --> 00:38:43,259
notice that it just about all of these

00:38:41,789 --> 00:38:45,569
it's like taking an image from the

00:38:43,259 --> 00:38:47,189
sidebar popping it over here that's just

00:38:45,569 --> 00:38:50,189
standard fare and these things now the

00:38:47,189 --> 00:38:52,559
ability to grab the boundary of a region

00:38:50,189 --> 00:38:54,839
and drag it out two inches make it wider

00:38:52,559 --> 00:38:56,819
content reef lowing that's all pretty

00:38:54,839 --> 00:38:58,349
much expected functionality again and

00:38:56,819 --> 00:38:59,969
contribs

00:38:58,349 --> 00:39:02,640
you know there's display suite there's

00:38:59,969 --> 00:39:04,650
all these options panels IPE creates a

00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:06,659
really nice experience very similar it's

00:39:04,650 --> 00:39:09,119
what we see on the videos but you got to

00:39:06,659 --> 00:39:10,890
know exists first so don't panic

00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:13,679
right it's like Drupal looks a little

00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:15,299
bit you know it was built by developers

00:39:13,679 --> 00:39:17,999
for developers that's our history you

00:39:15,299 --> 00:39:19,499
know but we do need to do some more work

00:39:17,999 --> 00:39:20,609
on the design side of this so that

00:39:19,499 --> 00:39:22,799
because because what's really

00:39:20,609 --> 00:39:25,229
frustrating to me is when people choose

00:39:22,799 --> 00:39:27,449
something like WordPress over Drupal

00:39:25,229 --> 00:39:28,739
because of these hurdles because they

00:39:27,449 --> 00:39:31,140
look at it they can't figure out what it

00:39:28,739 --> 00:39:32,219
does and it appears limited and they

00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:34,829
don't know where to begin with the

00:39:32,219 --> 00:39:37,890
35,000 contributed modules so they pick

00:39:34,829 --> 00:39:40,380
WordPress or whatever they pick and they

00:39:37,890 --> 00:39:42,029
use it forever until they find a project

00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:43,559
that they can't do the thing they want

00:39:42,029 --> 00:39:46,049
to do with because it finally got too

00:39:43,559 --> 00:39:47,549
complex or the functionality wasn't

00:39:46,049 --> 00:39:49,289
there or whatever the reason is and then

00:39:47,549 --> 00:39:51,569
they'd be grudgingly come back to Drupal

00:39:49,289 --> 00:39:52,619
like four years later and they're forced

00:39:51,569 --> 00:39:54,299
to learn it and then they're like oh my

00:39:52,619 --> 00:39:57,509
god chuckles amazing

00:39:54,299 --> 00:39:59,489
you know it's like yes I would love them

00:39:57,509 --> 00:40:01,799
to feel that in the first 30 seconds of

00:39:59,489 --> 00:40:03,329
using the thing instead of like you know

00:40:01,799 --> 00:40:04,979
four years later and only after like

00:40:03,329 --> 00:40:06,690
really resenting their life right like

00:40:04,979 --> 00:40:12,000
is that a good goal we can get behind

00:40:06,690 --> 00:40:14,460
so I want to re-emphasize again contribu

00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:18,930
we've got contributing for all kinds of

00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:20,460
this stuff media layouts all of it but

00:40:18,930 --> 00:40:21,990
we want to try and get a lot of that

00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:24,180
stuff into course so it's out of the box

00:40:21,990 --> 00:40:27,240
expected as people work so what are we

00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:28,620
doing about all of that so there's some

00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:31,500
stuff that we've already done so I want

00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:33,770
to talk about that the first is that

00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:35,730
juries announced new initiatives in

00:40:33,770 --> 00:40:38,520
DrupalCon New Orleans a couple months

00:40:35,730 --> 00:40:40,320
ago and you'll notice the boxes here

00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:42,450
pretty much map one to one with some of

00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:44,310
these gaps that we see between the

00:40:42,450 --> 00:40:46,320
Drupal out-of-the-box experience and the

00:40:44,310 --> 00:40:48,510
and what our competitors are doing so

00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:52,620
you know blocks and layout media

00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:55,440
workflow cross channel orchestration API

00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:57,660
first data modelling all of that very

00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:59,550
closely aligns with stuff that our

00:40:57,660 --> 00:41:01,140
competitors are doing really really well

00:40:59,550 --> 00:41:03,780
out of the box and we don't do well out

00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:06,060
of the box right now we also made

00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:07,740
changes to the Drupal release cycle as a

00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:09,030
Drupal 8 so I don't know if everyone

00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:10,410
knows about this it was interesting we

00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:13,260
had a trivia thing that we did at the

00:41:10,410 --> 00:41:14,760
booth last night and people didn't

00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:17,340
believe me when I told them that Drupal

00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:19,260
8.2 has a release date and that we're

00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:21,240
gonna hit it like people did not believe

00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:22,650
me on that at all so I just want to talk

00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:26,340
about this for a second because this is

00:41:22,650 --> 00:41:28,290
kind of new so drupal 8.0 had a when

00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:29,850
it's ready kind of thing going about it

00:41:28,290 --> 00:41:31,020
right and we worked on it we worked on

00:41:29,850 --> 00:41:32,760
and we worked on it we worked on the

00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:34,530
deal was we would ship it when we got to

00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:35,970
zero critical bugs and that

00:41:34,530 --> 00:41:39,360
unfortunately took about four and a half

00:41:35,970 --> 00:41:42,090
years and everyone universally said that

00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:44,610
sucked let's never do that again and

00:41:42,090 --> 00:41:46,200
everyone was like great idea so we've

00:41:44,610 --> 00:41:48,690
adopted this thing called semantic

00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:50,370
versioning in Drupal 8 so we use three

00:41:48,690 --> 00:41:51,810
digits instead of two digits and you're

00:41:50,370 --> 00:41:52,200
like you're a nerd why do I care about

00:41:51,810 --> 00:41:54,420
that

00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:56,550
well you care about that because when

00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:59,640
the middle number goes up you get

00:41:56,550 --> 00:42:02,070
backwards compatible features so when we

00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:03,660
ship in 8.1 after six months that's

00:42:02,070 --> 00:42:06,030
gonna have things like big pipe in it

00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:08,670
and migrate and things like this when we

00:42:06,030 --> 00:42:09,900
ship in 8.2 that's gonna have this stuff

00:42:08,670 --> 00:42:11,700
I'm going to talk about in a second here

00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:13,380
but like new features coming out the

00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:14,850
pipe every six months so we have a much

00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:16,830
shorter innovation cycle than we ever

00:42:14,850 --> 00:42:19,170
did and the other great thing about this

00:42:16,830 --> 00:42:20,190
is that the really smart awesome core

00:42:19,170 --> 00:42:22,950
developers

00:42:20,190 --> 00:42:24,869
are working in the same codebase that

00:42:22,950 --> 00:42:26,130
all of our end-users are using and so

00:42:24,869 --> 00:42:28,020
we're all playing in the same sandbox

00:42:26,130 --> 00:42:29,280
together and fixing the same bugs and

00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:31,579
this kind of thing it is it's beautiful

00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:35,130
its glorious wonderful thing

00:42:31,579 --> 00:42:38,010
so you'll see Drupal 8 point 2.0 ship

00:42:35,130 --> 00:42:39,750
October 5th of 2016 and then we've got

00:42:38,010 --> 00:42:41,970
until the end of January to get all the

00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:43,170
features we want into 8.3 and that's

00:42:41,970 --> 00:42:45,750
gonna ship in April

00:42:43,170 --> 00:42:47,849
right before Drupal con Baltimore and

00:42:45,750 --> 00:42:49,560
then one final thing we've done sort of

00:42:47,849 --> 00:42:51,839
like a governance process wise as we've

00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:54,270
we've created a new innovation tool for

00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:56,640
ourselves called experimental modules so

00:42:54,270 --> 00:42:59,250
in the past the the rule was when

00:42:56,640 --> 00:43:02,640
something got into core was like stuck

00:42:59,250 --> 00:43:07,950
there forever Drupal 7 still ships with

00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:09,270
jQuery one point dusty graveyard I don't

00:43:07,950 --> 00:43:13,290
know what version it is but it's really

00:43:09,270 --> 00:43:14,609
old and and in Drupal 8 because of

00:43:13,290 --> 00:43:16,230
semantic versioning things like we can

00:43:14,609 --> 00:43:17,790
change stuff like that this is another

00:43:16,230 --> 00:43:20,190
sort of like little knob we have to

00:43:17,790 --> 00:43:21,990
tweak with innovation so this

00:43:20,190 --> 00:43:24,990
effectively creates sort of a sandbox

00:43:21,990 --> 00:43:27,480
sound like beta versions of stuff but in

00:43:24,990 --> 00:43:29,730
core so you don't have to you know go on

00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:32,010
drupal.org and try and find the special

00:43:29,730 --> 00:43:34,079
module out of the 35,000 modules there

00:43:32,010 --> 00:43:35,970
are that does what you want instead

00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:37,710
there's like you know ten of them that

00:43:35,970 --> 00:43:39,450
we know this is a feature we want in

00:43:37,710 --> 00:43:40,710
core this is not quite ready yet but

00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:42,210
let's get it out there in front of

00:43:40,710 --> 00:43:43,579
people so that they can test it and see

00:43:42,210 --> 00:43:46,740
how it works

00:43:43,579 --> 00:43:49,079
it also lets us make changes to it based

00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:51,060
on real-world feedback as opposed to you

00:43:49,079 --> 00:43:52,530
know usually what happened is we you

00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:54,180
know make some user-facing improvement

00:43:52,530 --> 00:43:55,829
we get some 300 comments everyone would

00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:57,150
be like ah let's just get it and and

00:43:55,829 --> 00:43:59,040
then everyone walk away because they

00:43:57,150 --> 00:44:00,599
never wanted to touch that again now

00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:04,260
things are getting in after only like

00:44:00,599 --> 00:44:05,940
100 comments so that's better and and we

00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:08,130
make iterative improvements to them over

00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:09,720
time and then the idea is that after

00:44:08,130 --> 00:44:11,339
we've iterated on them a few times we

00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:12,540
make them into official core modules and

00:44:11,339 --> 00:44:14,880
then they do become locked down and

00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:17,430
stable so this is a really cool thing

00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:20,310
that we're experimenting with so in 8.2

00:44:17,430 --> 00:44:21,839
we actually made good use of this so 8.2

00:44:20,310 --> 00:44:24,119
is just with an experimental module to

00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:25,829
do content moderation so the ability to

00:44:24,119 --> 00:44:28,560
define arbitrary workflow states like

00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:30,599
draft or pending legal review assign

00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:32,970
which roles or permissions have the

00:44:30,599 --> 00:44:33,690
access to move content back and forth

00:44:32,970 --> 00:44:35,790
and actually do

00:44:33,690 --> 00:44:37,530
that so it's essentially the workbench

00:44:35,790 --> 00:44:41,100
moderation module in core which is

00:44:37,530 --> 00:44:47,190
awesome place box is an experimental

00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:48,900
module hey go back which lets you add

00:44:47,190 --> 00:44:50,790
blocks right from the front end of your

00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:53,250
site as opposed to having to go to that

00:44:50,790 --> 00:44:54,870
weird back end with the weird table and

00:44:53,250 --> 00:44:56,850
the draggy drop eros and this kind of

00:44:54,870 --> 00:44:59,040
thing you just go oh I want a block

00:44:56,850 --> 00:45:01,250
right here place block click it and then

00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:03,180
BOOM it's n it's really really nice

00:45:01,250 --> 00:45:05,220
settings tray is another one of these

00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:07,080
that we've done and so this is sort of

00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:09,270
like an in-place configuration type of

00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:11,010
things you go into edit mode you click

00:45:09,270 --> 00:45:13,830
on any block on your site and you can

00:45:11,010 --> 00:45:15,930
change it right there hit save and it's

00:45:13,830 --> 00:45:17,220
done you don't have to go to the back

00:45:15,930 --> 00:45:19,290
end of your site go under appearance

00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:20,550
settings go under the site may all these

00:45:19,290 --> 00:45:23,130
kind of nonsense that you would have had

00:45:20,550 --> 00:45:25,020
to do before it's just I see it I click

00:45:23,130 --> 00:45:27,780
it it's done so we're trying to get a

00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:30,270
lot more into this outside-in pattern so

00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:32,100
that we can we can give any users the

00:45:30,270 --> 00:45:33,270
ability to make changes right from the

00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:35,520
front of their site without having to

00:45:33,270 --> 00:45:38,010
know all the places that Drupal decided

00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:39,570
to stick stuff which is really nice and

00:45:38,010 --> 00:45:41,730
then I briefly want to talk because I

00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:44,160
know I'm running low on time about stuff

00:45:41,730 --> 00:45:45,540
that is coming soon question mark so

00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:47,340
this is stuff that people are working on

00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:49,080
hopefully we'll make it into these

00:45:47,340 --> 00:45:50,610
versions that I've targeted but we'll

00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:52,170
have to see what happens and the more

00:45:50,610 --> 00:45:55,920
people who help out the better chances

00:45:52,170 --> 00:46:00,240
are so whoops this is drag-and-drop

00:45:55,920 --> 00:46:02,700
image downloads so kind of doing quick

00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:04,860
edit on images so you can just you know

00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:06,300
go drag a picture of Newman onto your

00:46:04,860 --> 00:46:08,610
picture of you laying I don't think that

00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:10,440
was an improvement really and then you

00:46:08,610 --> 00:46:12,450
go ahead and just save and it's done so

00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:14,250
same type of thing we saw for blocks but

00:46:12,450 --> 00:46:16,260
now we have it for images so that's a

00:46:14,250 --> 00:46:17,940
patch and it got to our TBC at one point

00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:21,990
so hopefully that's either in there now

00:46:17,940 --> 00:46:24,540
or will be shortly media library this is

00:46:21,990 --> 00:46:25,830
a lot more sci-fi like we wish it would

00:46:24,540 --> 00:46:27,990
work like this but this is some

00:46:25,830 --> 00:46:30,720
designing work that Kevin O'Leary has

00:46:27,990 --> 00:46:32,910
done so this is starting to look a lot

00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:34,680
more like what we saw in WordPress and

00:46:32,910 --> 00:46:37,350
Squarespace and those other kinds of

00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:38,850
solutions where you have grid you can

00:46:37,350 --> 00:46:41,640
see all the images that you have on your

00:46:38,850 --> 00:46:43,650
site already there's an advanced view if

00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:46,190
you want to see all the the properties

00:46:43,650 --> 00:46:46,190
and things like that

00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:55,920
um drag-and-drop supports multi upload

00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:59,430
support so I don't think we'll get all

00:46:55,920 --> 00:47:00,869
of this in 83 at all but there's a lot

00:46:59,430 --> 00:47:02,849
of this that I think we can get and then

00:47:00,869 --> 00:47:04,710
the ability when you go to add an image

00:47:02,849 --> 00:47:06,240
instead of just getting one file upload

00:47:04,710 --> 00:47:08,369
field you can select from existing

00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:10,290
images that you've already uploaded you

00:47:08,369 --> 00:47:13,290
can choose to upload your own you can

00:47:10,290 --> 00:47:16,710
add metadata so feelable images this

00:47:13,290 --> 00:47:19,500
kind of thing you know this would be

00:47:16,710 --> 00:47:21,030
kind of nice right like that would look

00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:23,280
pretty cool and then if we want to get

00:47:21,030 --> 00:47:25,170
really crazy we can do like Photoshop in

00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:28,740
Drupal and we could like let you crop

00:47:25,170 --> 00:47:29,849
stuff and like add a page curl I'm sure

00:47:28,740 --> 00:47:31,770
we would put that in court because

00:47:29,849 --> 00:47:34,859
that's an 80% case if I ever saw one you

00:47:31,770 --> 00:47:39,270
know and yeah and then the ability to do

00:47:34,859 --> 00:47:40,619
all that on mobile as well so that issue

00:47:39,270 --> 00:47:42,119
down there that's currently where we're

00:47:40,619 --> 00:47:43,890
all discussing like what should the

00:47:42,119 --> 00:47:45,630
media library look like an 8-3 and we're

00:47:43,890 --> 00:47:47,549
trying to pick a point that's like

00:47:45,630 --> 00:47:49,500
pretty simple starting point because

00:47:47,549 --> 00:47:51,210
again it's going in as experimental so

00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:53,430
we can start with just the basics and

00:47:51,210 --> 00:47:54,480
then iterate on it from there but that's

00:47:53,430 --> 00:47:56,339
sort of the discussion that we're having

00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:57,960
because we really want to try and get a

00:47:56,339 --> 00:48:02,400
media library solution 83 that would be

00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:03,710
awesome on the API side of things one of

00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:06,990
the things that's being explored is

00:48:03,710 --> 00:48:10,260
using the JSON API specification instead

00:48:06,990 --> 00:48:11,880
of the weird that Drupal does so this

00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:13,319
would make it a lot more possible to use

00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:14,640
a common standard that JavaScript

00:48:13,319 --> 00:48:19,200
developers are used to working with in

00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:21,299
order to JSON to solve the default

00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:24,799
content problem there's a snowman

00:48:21,299 --> 00:48:27,690
initiative that was around back in 2011

00:48:24,799 --> 00:48:29,670
2012 that area and kind of got stymied

00:48:27,690 --> 00:48:31,440
because basically anything they wanted

00:48:29,670 --> 00:48:33,480
to do with default content involved

00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:36,270
having a fuse and there was no views in

00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:37,740
core so I was like ah what can we do but

00:48:36,270 --> 00:48:39,240
now there is using core and there's

00:48:37,740 --> 00:48:41,160
workflows and there's all kinds of cool

00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:42,599
stuff and so there's a lot of people

00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:45,059
trying to dust this initiative off and

00:48:42,599 --> 00:48:46,619
actually start it up again and this time

00:48:45,059 --> 00:48:48,720
probably building off to work that

00:48:46,619 --> 00:48:50,040
documentation team has done to create

00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:51,720
their curated set of documentation

00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:53,250
spaced around like a farmers market use

00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:55,230
case because it doesn't really matter

00:48:53,250 --> 00:48:56,400
what the use case is is just give it one

00:48:55,230 --> 00:48:59,069
out of the box so you can kind of see

00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:00,720
what your bull does we also have some

00:48:59,069 --> 00:49:02,670
folks working on swappable layouts and

00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:04,590
have a nice video for this one but the

00:49:02,670 --> 00:49:06,360
ability to click different layouts and

00:49:04,590 --> 00:49:09,180
have it automatically you know using the

00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:11,610
outside-in pattern or the settings tray

00:49:09,180 --> 00:49:12,600
it's called now flip back and forth

00:49:11,610 --> 00:49:14,340
between your different things and

00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:17,430
there's a patch in this issue down there

00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:19,920
that is actually allowing you to switch

00:49:17,430 --> 00:49:22,200
layouts on a per content type basis so

00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:25,800
you can make your pages one column your

00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:29,550
you know excuse me your blog posts two

00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:33,030
column this kind of thing one more thing

00:49:29,550 --> 00:49:35,070
on the on the API side of things there's

00:49:33,030 --> 00:49:36,330
this library that aqua develop called

00:49:35,070 --> 00:49:40,170
waterwheel which creates like a

00:49:36,330 --> 00:49:44,010
JavaScript SDK wrapper around Drupal's

00:49:40,170 --> 00:49:45,120
like raw PHP breasts api so that we're

00:49:44,010 --> 00:49:47,070
hoping will be a really friendly

00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:48,900
introduction to drupal for people who

00:49:47,070 --> 00:49:50,640
live in green java scripts because they

00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:53,570
can work in their native language and

00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:56,370
they want to work PHP because you know

00:49:53,570 --> 00:49:58,190
PHP just you know it doesn't shine quite

00:49:56,370 --> 00:50:00,150
like it used to with the kids these days

00:49:58,190 --> 00:50:02,940
and then the last thing that's pretty

00:50:00,150 --> 00:50:05,400
cool there's something the eclipse is

00:50:02,940 --> 00:50:07,710
something the workflow team is working

00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:09,840
on towards which is the ability the

00:50:07,710 --> 00:50:11,850
stage content so you can see this is the

00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:13,530
live site it has no content the staging

00:50:11,850 --> 00:50:15,060
content and it's not just like the

00:50:13,530 --> 00:50:18,240
ability to preview an individual note

00:50:15,060 --> 00:50:20,100
but actually see menu changes and

00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:21,930
taxonomy changes and block changes and

00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:23,670
everything and view that in its own

00:50:21,930 --> 00:50:24,750
sandbox environment to verify that looks

00:50:23,670 --> 00:50:26,760
okay

00:50:24,750 --> 00:50:29,240
before you deploy it and that would be

00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:31,140
really handy for example this election

00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:33,840
that's coming up in the united states

00:50:31,140 --> 00:50:35,280
because you would be able to kind of mac

00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:36,780
your whole site out for if Trump wins

00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:38,940
the election or Hillary wins the

00:50:36,780 --> 00:50:41,340
election I tried to find like a less

00:50:38,940 --> 00:50:45,030
depressing example of that but it's a

00:50:41,340 --> 00:50:46,800
beautiful answer alright so if you want

00:50:45,030 --> 00:50:48,810
to help we would love the help this is a

00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:50,310
lot of work but there's a lot of really

00:50:48,810 --> 00:50:52,500
great people who are very passionate and

00:50:50,310 --> 00:50:54,720
working on it actively and so please

00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:56,400
join us so the URL at the bottom of this

00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:59,640
page I'll post my slide to Twitter after

00:50:56,400 --> 00:51:01,290
but um the new URL on this page links

00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:02,580
off to the listing of the strategic

00:51:01,290 --> 00:51:04,830
initiatives all the ones that I covered

00:51:02,580 --> 00:51:06,270
earlier from Jesus keynote and they all

00:51:04,830 --> 00:51:08,010
have jumping-off points to whatever

00:51:06,270 --> 00:51:09,330
issues that things are going on and a

00:51:08,010 --> 00:51:11,060
lot of these teams have meetings that

00:51:09,330 --> 00:51:12,840
happen once a week or every couple weeks

00:51:11,060 --> 00:51:14,340
almost all of them are gonna have

00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:16,290
sprints on Friday

00:51:14,340 --> 00:51:17,850
if you are here on Friday which you

00:51:16,290 --> 00:51:20,010
totally should be there will be a

00:51:17,850 --> 00:51:21,570
contribution sprint and that's for

00:51:20,010 --> 00:51:22,980
that's for anybody you don't have to be

00:51:21,570 --> 00:51:26,640
a coder you don't have to be an expert

00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:28,350
you can come and say I have content

00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:29,760
authors and I know what they hate about

00:51:28,350 --> 00:51:31,800
media right that would be useful

00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:33,810
information I have Internet Explorer

00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:35,490
that would be amazing because none of us

00:51:33,810 --> 00:51:37,770
have Internet Explorer like this kind of

00:51:35,490 --> 00:51:39,210
thing so please come down find a table

00:51:37,770 --> 00:51:40,950
to join up with we would love to have

00:51:39,210 --> 00:51:42,360
you if you're totally brand new to the

00:51:40,950 --> 00:51:44,250
contribution process there's actually

00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:46,410
mentored sprints happening so they'll

00:51:44,250 --> 00:51:48,120
pair you up with someone to learn all

00:51:46,410 --> 00:51:49,530
about the the get process in the issue

00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:51,870
queue and how it all works it's a really

00:51:49,530 --> 00:51:53,730
really fantastic opportunity to to

00:51:51,870 --> 00:51:55,610
network and just share it with other

00:51:53,730 --> 00:52:00,110
people so I hope you take it up and

00:51:55,610 --> 00:52:00,110
that's what I got so thank you everybody

00:52:04,030 --> 00:52:07,090
so I think we have like three minutes

00:52:06,340 --> 00:52:10,890
for questions

00:52:07,090 --> 00:52:10,890
um yes Larry

00:52:25,470 --> 00:52:30,270
yes so that his statement was you know

00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:32,819
some of these like contentful Weebly or

00:52:30,270 --> 00:52:36,300
sorry wicks and Squarespace are all self

00:52:32,819 --> 00:52:39,000
hosted your you know they host it for

00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:40,800
you the opposite is self hosted they're

00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:42,390
managed services so you don't really

00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:44,250
have to worry about deploying stuff back

00:52:42,390 --> 00:52:46,109
and forth do the other solutions have a

00:52:44,250 --> 00:52:49,050
deployment thing and how does it compare

00:52:46,109 --> 00:52:51,780
to CMI I don't know because literally

00:52:49,050 --> 00:52:53,130
impossible to install site core or Adobe

00:52:51,780 --> 00:52:56,010
without talking to a freaking

00:52:53,130 --> 00:52:58,079
salesperson um so I haven't been able to

00:52:56,010 --> 00:52:59,609
dig in and find that out but I know that

00:52:58,079 --> 00:53:01,079
they do have the same concept like I

00:52:59,609 --> 00:53:04,410
showed in the video the workflow stuff

00:53:01,079 --> 00:53:06,540
of the idea of staging content elsewhere

00:53:04,410 --> 00:53:08,640
than the production site and then moving

00:53:06,540 --> 00:53:10,920
it over in terms of configuration I'm

00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:14,540
not sure sorry does anyone else on the

00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:14,540
answer there's a couple hands Joelle

00:53:29,460 --> 00:53:33,240
okay so the way sitecore handles that I

00:53:31,530 --> 00:53:39,210
guess is they have a completely separate

00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:40,680
site for staging for XML right on party

00:53:39,210 --> 00:53:42,750
like it's 1999 okay

00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:44,280
so they use XML to transfer the

00:53:42,750 --> 00:53:49,190
configuration and the content from one

00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:49,190
site to another cool yes in the back

00:54:30,290 --> 00:54:34,310
and all of the use cases and they're

00:54:32,420 --> 00:54:36,050
more or less infrastructure that at this

00:54:34,310 --> 00:54:39,020
point is just expected functionality of

00:54:36,050 --> 00:54:40,700
CMS's that are modern today in terms of

00:54:39,020 --> 00:54:43,580
the distributions though I totally agree

00:54:40,700 --> 00:54:44,900
and the more we do to get rid of the

00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:46,610
monkey work you have to do to make a

00:54:44,900 --> 00:54:49,190
distribution usable by a pharmaceutical

00:54:46,610 --> 00:54:51,500
company the more that you could focus on

00:54:49,190 --> 00:54:53,330
making sure the default content is pills

00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:55,190
and doctor appointments and stuff like

00:54:53,330 --> 00:54:56,360
that because that's what you want to

00:54:55,190 --> 00:54:58,400
build in your distribution you don't

00:54:56,360 --> 00:55:00,560
want to build your own custom bespoke

00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:02,780
media library like nobody wants to do

00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:04,280
that you know so you can use other

00:55:02,780 --> 00:55:05,720
distributions that are more general like

00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:07,280
say the lightening distribution does a

00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:09,260
lot of them you know heavy elbow work

00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:11,150
for you to like get the workflow and the

00:55:09,260 --> 00:55:12,890
layouts and the stuff working but you

00:55:11,150 --> 00:55:14,270
have to know again you have to know that

00:55:12,890 --> 00:55:16,520
lightning exists and that's the thing

00:55:14,270 --> 00:55:18,380
you can use and it would just be better

00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:21,830
if the default product just worked that

00:55:18,380 --> 00:55:22,850
way because that's what people who don't

00:55:21,830 --> 00:55:25,310
know Drupal at all are gonna be

00:55:22,850 --> 00:55:26,780
comparing ants and I think people also

00:55:25,310 --> 00:55:29,090
get freaked out about the idea of like

00:55:26,780 --> 00:55:31,580
oh my god it's so big

00:55:29,090 --> 00:55:33,860
you know all this stuff to maintain but

00:55:31,580 --> 00:55:35,750
at the same time what we've also done is

00:55:33,860 --> 00:55:38,300
we've also effectively outsourced a lot

00:55:35,750 --> 00:55:39,950
of the really low-level stuff like you

00:55:38,300 --> 00:55:41,990
know our entire bootstrap process I'll

00:55:39,950 --> 00:55:44,540
run through symphony now the routing has

00:55:41,990 --> 00:55:45,830
run through symphony we use like gamal

00:55:44,540 --> 00:55:48,530
things from other lies that we've done a

00:55:45,830 --> 00:55:49,940
lot to incorporate third-party libraries

00:55:48,530 --> 00:55:52,040
to do stuff that honestly we don't

00:55:49,940 --> 00:55:53,690
really care about I don't care how our

00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:55,640
llamó parser works as long as it works

00:55:53,690 --> 00:55:57,680
what I care about is that the you know

00:55:55,640 --> 00:55:59,270
user interface and the interactions that

00:55:57,680 --> 00:56:00,800
people have are really Pleasant when

00:55:59,270 --> 00:56:02,450
they use Drupal so they fall in love

00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:05,360
with it the same way that I have in the

00:56:02,450 --> 00:56:08,060
same way that you have so so I feel like

00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:09,500
we we are definitely growing the size of

00:56:08,060 --> 00:56:11,900
core but in terms of the size of code

00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:13,580
that we have to maintain we're starting

00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:14,960
to lose a lot of the stuff we weren't

00:56:13,580 --> 00:56:16,760
really good at maintaining in the first

00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:18,680
place and we're instead adopting things

00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:20,300
that are core to what we are as a

00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:22,640
product and I think that that's a fair

00:56:20,300 --> 00:56:24,470
trade and so I actually feel pretty good

00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:26,900
about that but that's a little bit of a

00:56:24,470 --> 00:56:28,340
contentious you know statement so yes we

00:56:26,900 --> 00:56:31,070
in the back and then will have to want

00:56:28,340 --> 00:56:33,910
to cut I think but I'm available to talk

00:56:31,070 --> 00:56:33,910
after so yes

00:56:37,930 --> 00:56:40,930
yeah

00:56:49,220 --> 00:56:51,910
huh

00:57:14,380 --> 00:57:21,580
yep that's fair so the statement was

00:57:16,660 --> 00:57:23,980
that a lot of the people that use cmss

00:57:21,580 --> 00:57:26,230
are kind of like done with CMS's like

00:57:23,980 --> 00:57:27,910
every three years whether they need it

00:57:26,230 --> 00:57:29,770
or not they switch to something else and

00:57:27,910 --> 00:57:31,270
they go fit in this big loop it's like

00:57:29,770 --> 00:57:32,890
WordPress and that did Drupal and then

00:57:31,270 --> 00:57:34,330
to Adobe and then back to Drupal then

00:57:32,890 --> 00:57:35,890
back to WordPress or whatever it ends up

00:57:34,330 --> 00:57:37,600
being and then after a while they're

00:57:35,890 --> 00:57:40,030
just kind of done with it

00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:42,970
and some of the disadvantages that CMS's

00:57:40,030 --> 00:57:45,310
gets bad rap for is being you know very

00:57:42,970 --> 00:57:46,600
monolithic and inflexible and these

00:57:45,310 --> 00:57:48,400
kinds of things there's a lot of code

00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:49,870
that you didn't write that you have to

00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:52,000
like debug in this kind of thing and

00:57:49,870 --> 00:57:53,770
this is why services like contentful are

00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:55,570
worth watching because if that ends up

00:57:53,770 --> 00:57:57,040
being the trend that happens you know

00:57:55,570 --> 00:57:58,390
that's that's something that well you

00:57:57,040 --> 00:58:00,070
know that that's people voting with

00:57:58,390 --> 00:58:02,500
their feet or whatever I think the

00:58:00,070 --> 00:58:06,070
selling point for Drupal especially

00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:08,680
Drupal 8 is that it can be it can kind

00:58:06,070 --> 00:58:10,780
of play any of those roles that you need

00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:12,250
it to play so if you need like I don't

00:58:10,780 --> 00:58:13,930
want to think I just wanted to do

00:58:12,250 --> 00:58:15,310
everything for me you can do that right

00:58:13,930 --> 00:58:16,990
like that's the that's the out of the

00:58:15,310 --> 00:58:19,240
box experience +30 contributed modules

00:58:16,990 --> 00:58:21,430
kind of thing and you can set Drupal up

00:58:19,240 --> 00:58:23,320
that way if you just want to use Drupal

00:58:21,430 --> 00:58:24,880
as a content store and you just want to

00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:26,380
interact with the API is just like

00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:28,810
contentful or something like that you

00:58:26,380 --> 00:58:30,520
can also do that but you can provide a

00:58:28,810 --> 00:58:32,740
much nicer authoring experience for the

00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:34,210
people working in the backend then

00:58:32,740 --> 00:58:36,790
something like content well offers at

00:58:34,210 --> 00:58:38,290
least today if you want to go really

00:58:36,790 --> 00:58:39,880
bespoke and you just want to do it all

00:58:38,290 --> 00:58:42,610
from scratch then Drupal is built on

00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:44,230
symphony so you can even do that so you

00:58:42,610 --> 00:58:46,360
can build a completely custom

00:58:44,230 --> 00:58:48,310
application that hardly uses Drupal at

00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:50,380
all or maybe doesn't use anything of

00:58:48,310 --> 00:58:52,810
Drupal except for one or two things and

00:58:50,380 --> 00:58:54,280
that's also fine so I feel like Drupal 8

00:58:52,810 --> 00:58:56,350
is in a really good position because it

00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:58,780
can span the gamut of whatever level of

00:58:56,350 --> 00:59:01,900
fatigue they have and whatever budget

00:58:58,780 --> 00:59:03,130
they have to handle that fatigue there's

00:59:01,900 --> 00:59:05,290
a lot of different options and ways that

00:59:03,130 --> 00:59:06,700
you can go so I guess that would be my

00:59:05,290 --> 00:59:10,470
question or answer I don't know that I

00:59:06,700 --> 00:59:10,470
answered a question but does that help

00:59:10,710 --> 00:59:16,240
yeah thanks for that right before lunch

00:59:13,510 --> 00:59:17,200
I appreciate that no we can talk more

00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:19,680
after though that was a great question

00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:19,680
okay

00:59:39,670 --> 00:59:44,720
yeah it's a it's a funny thing where if

00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:46,250
people pay a million dollars for a piece

00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:48,020
of software they expect it's gonna be

00:59:46,250 --> 00:59:49,490
good if you tell them the software's

00:59:48,020 --> 00:59:51,230
freeze or like well it must be junk

00:59:49,490 --> 00:59:53,150
because they're selling this for a

00:59:51,230 --> 00:59:55,100
million dollars what you know like yeah

00:59:53,150 --> 00:59:56,600
oh we still have a lot to do to educate

00:59:55,100 --> 00:59:58,130
people on open source and this kind of

00:59:56,600 --> 00:59:59,330
thing maybe what we just need to do is

00:59:58,130 --> 01:00:00,830
start charging three hundred thousand

00:59:59,330 --> 01:00:02,540
dollars for copy of Drupal I'm just

01:00:00,830 --> 01:00:04,910
kidding just kidding I didn't say that

01:00:02,540 --> 01:00:08,420
no anyway but yeah it's a it's a tricky

01:00:04,910 --> 01:00:10,910
problem I see more hands I'm gonna say

01:00:08,420 --> 01:00:12,560
people can go ahead and go I think one

01:00:10,910 --> 01:00:14,000
CH is happening now so if you want lunch

01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:15,560
you can feel free to go otherwise I'm

01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:18,580
happy to stay and answer a few more

01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:18,580
questions so yes

01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:41,550
that's a great question yes yeah yeah

01:00:44,190 --> 01:00:47,589
yeah

01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:49,180
so his statement was we're competing on

01:00:47,589 --> 01:00:50,020
a technical area in the feature level

01:00:49,180 --> 01:00:52,150
that's great

01:00:50,020 --> 01:00:53,619
but we don't have a little creepy

01:00:52,150 --> 01:00:54,849
two-minute video that talks about all

01:00:53,619 --> 01:00:56,140
the stuff that Drupal is gonna do to

01:00:54,849 --> 01:00:58,329
your visitors your site and why don't we

01:00:56,140 --> 01:01:00,940
have that right it's interesting because

01:00:58,329 --> 01:01:01,420
we we did have that when Drupal 7 was

01:01:00,940 --> 01:01:03,820
released

01:01:01,420 --> 01:01:06,160
Lullaby donated like their time to make

01:01:03,820 --> 01:01:08,770
a really slick video and we didn't quite

01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:10,839
get that together for Drupal 8 we should

01:01:08,770 --> 01:01:12,460
it would be great I think the reason

01:01:10,839 --> 01:01:15,190
that hasn't been done is like the Drupal

01:01:12,460 --> 01:01:16,570
Association is a really small team and

01:01:15,190 --> 01:01:19,359
so they don't really have the manpower

01:01:16,570 --> 01:01:21,010
for that at the moment and then I think

01:01:19,359 --> 01:01:23,170
there's lots of people within the

01:01:21,010 --> 01:01:25,599
community who could do that but you know

01:01:23,170 --> 01:01:26,980
it's a democracy and so no one said I'll

01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:28,300
do that you know everyone was kind of

01:01:26,980 --> 01:01:30,310
like oh yeah we should tell them video

01:01:28,300 --> 01:01:31,570
but I agree it's like when you go to

01:01:30,310 --> 01:01:33,310
these sites and they have just like a

01:01:31,570 --> 01:01:35,349
really slick I'm gonna tell you how this

01:01:33,310 --> 01:01:37,329
works in a minute and a half it's like

01:01:35,349 --> 01:01:39,099
yeah I wish we had that I wish we had

01:01:37,329 --> 01:01:41,050
that in the default installation right

01:01:39,099 --> 01:01:42,700
so people get that immediately and

01:01:41,050 --> 01:01:44,290
they're like oh that's how it works I

01:01:42,700 --> 01:01:46,300
got it now I know what a frigging node

01:01:44,290 --> 01:01:48,099
and a block is I don't have to like bash

01:01:46,300 --> 01:01:52,270
my head against that right

01:01:48,099 --> 01:01:54,280
are you volunteering yeh that would be

01:01:52,270 --> 01:01:55,270
so cool yeah I I would love to see

01:01:54,280 --> 01:01:57,160
something like that happen

01:01:55,270 --> 01:01:58,420
I don't immediately know how we would

01:01:57,160 --> 01:02:00,839
work that out well we could totally work

01:01:58,420 --> 01:02:03,130
that out and that would be great

01:02:00,839 --> 01:02:04,270
sorry I thought I was being followed by

01:02:03,130 --> 01:02:07,200
someone trying to assure me out of the

01:02:04,270 --> 01:02:07,200
room yes

01:02:49,900 --> 01:02:52,530
yep

01:02:54,120 --> 01:03:00,420
so Lari statement was like we just

01:02:57,830 --> 01:03:05,760
really oh I know why

01:03:00,420 --> 01:03:07,260
sorry it's important to start up your

01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:08,790
local development environment before you

01:03:07,260 --> 01:03:11,280
try and go to it it turns out that's a

01:03:08,790 --> 01:03:13,980
whole thing he said that we just

01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:15,450
redesigned the drupal.org homepage it

01:03:13,980 --> 01:03:19,010
actually looks really nice look at that

01:03:15,450 --> 01:03:21,720
it looks like we're an actual thing Wow

01:03:19,010 --> 01:03:24,120
we're thing like people use us look at

01:03:21,720 --> 01:03:26,400
that we have people they use us that's

01:03:24,120 --> 01:03:29,460
great we have a conference that some of

01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:30,900
you might be attending yeah so that

01:03:29,460 --> 01:03:34,670
looks really good but then your default

01:03:30,900 --> 01:03:41,460
first impression of Drupal looks like oh

01:03:34,670 --> 01:03:49,680
really it's really hard to type when I

01:03:41,460 --> 01:03:51,810
can't see there except without the Purdy

01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:53,970
mountain but yeah it looks like that

01:03:51,810 --> 01:03:59,820
right it's pretty plain there's not a

01:03:53,970 --> 01:04:02,370
lot of like really impressive stuff I I

01:03:59,820 --> 01:04:04,080
heard that through yeah and I actually

01:04:02,370 --> 01:04:07,110
think the solution of this is both a

01:04:04,080 --> 01:04:09,000
default theme and also fixing the sample

01:04:07,110 --> 01:04:10,670
content problem because it's really hard

01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:14,280
once again to just find a theme for

01:04:10,670 --> 01:04:17,250
nothing right it's a lot easier to

01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:18,450
design a default theme for something so

01:04:17,250 --> 01:04:20,280
I'd like I'd love to see those two

01:04:18,450 --> 01:04:21,660
things captured in parallel what's the

01:04:20,280 --> 01:04:23,190
issue do you know the issue idea off the

01:04:21,660 --> 01:04:28,470
top your head otherwise I can probably

01:04:23,190 --> 01:04:30,270
find it Lowrey shame so alright I don't

01:04:28,470 --> 01:04:34,470
have my two-factor authentication stuff

01:04:30,270 --> 01:04:37,140
anyway there's an issue called create a

01:04:34,470 --> 01:04:38,850
new user facing theme for Drupal and

01:04:37,140 --> 01:04:41,010
this is where there's discussion

01:04:38,850 --> 01:04:42,660
happening on this community initiative

01:04:41,010 --> 01:04:45,000
around creating a new default theme

01:04:42,660 --> 01:04:50,210
which would be awesome because Bartok is

01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:50,210
a little 2009 at this point you know so

01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:55,400
okay

01:05:06,760 --> 01:05:11,380
mm-hmm so the question is is one default

01:05:09,460 --> 01:05:12,250
theme like so if we make a new default

01:05:11,380 --> 01:05:14,470
theme that's great that solves the

01:05:12,250 --> 01:05:15,640
Bartek problem is that actually enough

01:05:14,470 --> 01:05:17,020
because you look at these other ones and

01:05:15,640 --> 01:05:20,440
they can do amazing things

01:05:17,020 --> 01:05:23,200
I actually think one incorp is fine as

01:05:20,440 --> 01:05:26,590
long as the browser looked decent right

01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:27,940
and it actually escalated nice-looking

01:05:26,590 --> 01:05:29,800
themes to the top of the list and not

01:05:27,940 --> 01:05:30,880
all the framework key themes so it

01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:33,400
requires some work on the drupal.org

01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:35,770
side I would say let's start with one if

01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:37,330
we can do one great and then we could

01:05:35,770 --> 01:05:39,810
you know do more of that if we needed to

01:05:37,330 --> 01:05:39,810
yes

01:05:55,720 --> 01:05:58,560
mm-hmm

01:06:12,670 --> 01:06:15,299
yep

01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:28,710
mm-hmm yeah it's a really good idea

01:06:26,369 --> 01:06:30,780
that's been talked about too the idea of

01:06:28,710 --> 01:06:31,859
asking some generic questions at the

01:06:30,780 --> 01:06:33,750
beginning of the installation process

01:06:31,859 --> 01:06:35,010
which is like what are you building are

01:06:33,750 --> 01:06:36,840
you building a blog are you building a

01:06:35,010 --> 01:06:39,780
portfolio website like some of the same

01:06:36,840 --> 01:06:44,550
stuff that Wix does I think I'm being

01:06:39,780 --> 01:06:46,859
kicked out so that you kind of have an

01:06:44,550 --> 01:06:48,869
idea of what what sample content what

01:06:46,859 --> 01:06:49,920
default blocks what default modules you

01:06:48,869 --> 01:06:53,190
might want an able that kind of thing

01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:55,920
and I think that's great as a goal to

01:06:53,190 --> 01:06:58,080
get to I would like to do one first like

01:06:55,920 --> 01:07:01,020
we don't have one let's start with one

01:06:58,080 --> 01:07:02,670
and if we do a good job with that yeah I

01:07:01,020 --> 01:07:04,859
would love to expand out no totally

01:07:02,670 --> 01:07:06,990
because you know then what we don't want

01:07:04,859 --> 01:07:09,170
is is the opposite problem are great now

01:07:06,990 --> 01:07:11,430
people think that Drupal is a great

01:07:09,170 --> 01:07:12,510
platform for a farmers market websites

01:07:11,430 --> 01:07:14,520
like we don't want that impression

01:07:12,510 --> 01:07:16,020
either right so we have to strike some

01:07:14,520 --> 01:07:18,510
kind of a middle ground but I think I

01:07:16,020 --> 01:07:20,100
think let's start with one that actually

01:07:18,510 --> 01:07:21,840
gets you some idea of what Drupal does

01:07:20,100 --> 01:07:23,490
out of the box so that you can learn

01:07:21,840 --> 01:07:26,580
within more like five minutes instead of

01:07:23,490 --> 01:07:27,960
like five weeks and then and then yeah I

01:07:26,580 --> 01:07:30,090
would love to do that because in theory

01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:32,550
that's pretty easy installation profiles

01:07:30,090 --> 01:07:34,800
are like this default content this

01:07:32,550 --> 01:07:37,410
default configuration boop-boop done you

01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:39,150
know and then that might also drive more

01:07:37,410 --> 01:07:40,950
than one default or more than one

01:07:39,150 --> 01:07:42,420
default core theme depending on you know

01:07:40,950 --> 01:07:43,770
the thing but I feel like there's a

01:07:42,420 --> 01:07:45,600
symbiotic relationship between those two

01:07:43,770 --> 01:07:49,170
initiatives so Laurie when is your core

01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:50,850
conversation five to six today so if

01:07:49,170 --> 01:07:52,830
you're a designer or a design like

01:07:50,850 --> 01:07:54,540
person you should totally come to the

01:07:52,830 --> 01:07:58,800
conversation that Lowrey is holding from

01:07:54,540 --> 01:07:59,970
five to six and that's oh one more okay

01:07:58,800 --> 01:08:02,869
and then we really got to go because

01:07:59,970 --> 01:08:02,869
people are hungry yes

01:08:19,869 --> 01:08:22,500
yeah

01:09:05,880 --> 01:09:10,639
I think so yeah so his statement was

01:09:14,239 --> 01:09:19,020
yeah one thing I want to okay so his

01:09:17,190 --> 01:09:20,250
statement was geez now that I saw these

01:09:19,020 --> 01:09:21,900
videos of all these things that people

01:09:20,250 --> 01:09:23,310
could do I'm kind of scared and like

01:09:21,900 --> 01:09:25,250
what is the compelling argument for

01:09:23,310 --> 01:09:27,750
choosing Drupal after seeing all that

01:09:25,250 --> 01:09:30,359
and I think the one thing I want to

01:09:27,750 --> 01:09:31,770
re-emphasize again is like I'm I'm

01:09:30,359 --> 01:09:33,719
making fun of Drupal a little bit

01:09:31,770 --> 01:09:36,359
because I'm making fun of a default

01:09:33,719 --> 01:09:37,739
installation but nobody sets up a Drupal

01:09:36,359 --> 01:09:39,690
site with a default installation right

01:09:37,739 --> 01:09:40,799
and there's tons of modules that do

01:09:39,690 --> 01:09:42,929
everything that I showed you in this

01:09:40,799 --> 01:09:44,670
video like if you want personalization

01:09:42,929 --> 01:09:46,859
stuff you can download the lifts if you

01:09:44,670 --> 01:09:49,319
want cool media stuff happening you can

01:09:46,859 --> 01:09:50,370
download like 30 media modules like an

01:09:49,319 --> 01:09:52,109
ad browser and whatever whatever

01:09:50,370 --> 01:09:54,029
whatever if you want layout to use

01:09:52,109 --> 01:09:55,980
panels panels IDE if you want this

01:09:54,029 --> 01:09:58,290
vistas so all of those have solutions

01:09:55,980 --> 01:10:01,230
you can totally set Drupal up to look a

01:09:58,290 --> 01:10:02,969
lot like adobe experience manager in

01:10:01,230 --> 01:10:04,350
fact we do that all the time at aqueous

01:10:02,969 --> 01:10:06,120
we have a thing called demo framework

01:10:04,350 --> 01:10:07,560
which automatically sets up a really

01:10:06,120 --> 01:10:09,330
nice-looking Drupal site that you can

01:10:07,560 --> 01:10:10,110
take into a competitive situation and it

01:10:09,330 --> 01:10:11,850
looks really good

01:10:10,110 --> 01:10:14,159
we have lightning as a distribution

01:10:11,850 --> 01:10:15,810
which already sets up all the layouts

01:10:14,159 --> 01:10:17,179
and workflow and all that kind of stuff

01:10:15,810 --> 01:10:19,409
so you don't have to monkey with that

01:10:17,179 --> 01:10:20,760
and then that you could use that as a

01:10:19,409 --> 01:10:22,620
starting point for example so I want to

01:10:20,760 --> 01:10:25,980
emphasize Drupal can do all of that

01:10:22,620 --> 01:10:27,420
stuff we just want Drupal core to do a

01:10:25,980 --> 01:10:29,100
lot of that stuff because right now it

01:10:27,420 --> 01:10:31,170
just looks kind of you know it doesn't

01:10:29,100 --> 01:10:32,850
look great the compelling reason to use

01:10:31,170 --> 01:10:35,580
Drupal over those conclusions is one

01:10:32,850 --> 01:10:37,860
it's free too it's open source 3 it has

01:10:35,580 --> 01:10:40,380
a much much larger community than any of

01:10:37,860 --> 01:10:42,600
those other than WordPress and we

01:10:40,380 --> 01:10:44,429
innovate a lot faster than they do so

01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:46,110
for example when a new service gets

01:10:44,429 --> 01:10:48,960
announced like Pinterest was new at one

01:10:46,110 --> 01:10:50,760
point you had to wait like nine months

01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:53,250
for Pinterest integration to get on

01:10:50,760 --> 01:10:55,080
their roadmap but in Drupal someone

01:10:53,250 --> 01:10:59,070
wrote that in a weekend right and it's

01:10:55,080 --> 01:11:03,270
there and you can just use it we have to

01:10:59,070 --> 01:11:05,730
leave anyway so yes so that flexibility

01:11:03,270 --> 01:11:07,590
developer experience all that stuff

01:11:05,730 --> 01:11:09,090
Drupal is way more technically flexible

01:11:07,590 --> 01:11:10,440
than any of these and it can bend to fit

01:11:09,090 --> 01:11:12,360
any needs so lots of different

01:11:10,440 --> 01:11:14,570
compelling reasons thank you for coming

01:11:12,360 --> 01:11:14,570
