Title: DrupalCon Dublin 2016: Improving the Responsive Web Design Process in 2016
Publication date: 2016-09-27
Playlist: DrupalCon Dublin 2016
Description: 
	It's been 6 years since the term Responsive Web Design (RWD) was coined and today is difficult to see new projects without implementing it. But this time has allowed us to see the implementation can be even more important than the technique and the theory.

The RWD covers from the performance to the implementation of patterns and "standard" behaviors to improve usability.

In this session I will review tools, techniques and concepts to improve our projects:

Modern Design processes
Performance
CSS structuring and optimization (CSS Methodologies and Living Styleguides)
Fixed-pixel vs relative units (and Viewport Sized Units)
Responsive Typography and FOUT, FOIT
Images, Responsive images and SVGs
Asynchronous loading
Proxy-based browsers
Beyond the Mouse
RWD patterns and Progressively Disclosure
I will show simulations for a better understanding.

This session is aimed to anyone who wants to improve his RWD knowledge, although a minimal RWD knowledge is expected. If you have the basics of RWD but have not gone much farther, this session will help you see the effects of a poor implementation. If the RWD is already your day-to-day, you might leave with interesting ideas to improve your projects.

	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,990
okay let's start I think it's a time

00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:09,510
hello everybody I'm Christina to

00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:12,750
millions I'm designer and front-end

00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:15,360
developer at timbra design and drupal

00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:18,990
shop based in Barcelona and you can find

00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:25,199
me as the green on drupal.org or IRC or

00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:28,109
two million on Twitter first we are

00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:33,570
going to check that statement that mary

00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:36,030
meeker mamita on 2008 saying that mobile

00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:41,540
was going to overtake fixed internet

00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:43,860
access by the year 2014 and it was

00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:47,090
something like that because actually

00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:50,309
last year in the state it was around

00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:53,480
seventy percent of traffic for mobiles

00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:56,850
and I think in the UK goes around

00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:59,520
sixty-six percent so something like that

00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:02,670
but what actually happened is that

00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:05,790
mobile isn't killing the desktop what it

00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:08,610
actually is happening is that users I

00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:10,890
have are having multi-device experiences

00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:13,680
they starts for example on the desktop

00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:16,590
and they then they follow on the on the

00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,840
mobile for example you search on address

00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:21,869
on the desktop then you send it to your

00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:26,280
mom to your mobile and then you get the

00:01:21,869 --> 00:01:29,060
directions to go to the place so that's

00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,060
not exactly like that

00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:36,869
and it goes around six years ago one is

00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:41,400
a market named a responsive web design

00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:44,310
and a lot of stuff has changed st. since

00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:47,130
then a lot of processes a lot of things

00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:50,399
have changed so for example the

00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:54,720
processes have have been evolving since

00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:57,270
then for example the quantum first and

00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:59,960
the mobile first are really a thing

00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:04,800
nowadays know everybody does that

00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:07,710
quantum first is having the main content

00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:09,479
the most relevant content first on the

00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:12,269
website and keeping that in mind and

00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:15,000
mobile first is thinking first on mobile

00:02:12,269 --> 00:02:17,459
the first that display the first is a

00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,299
small display that the user is going to

00:02:17,459 --> 00:02:23,730
see and then just work together with

00:02:21,299 --> 00:02:27,560
quantum first and now then you have the

00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:30,480
thing that has to be on the first place

00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:34,680
another thing that has that has changed

00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:37,350
since then is that we don't work or we

00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:42,750
shouldn't work anymore with static

00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:45,630
compositions photoshop PSD PNG's we

00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:47,579
shouldn't work with that anymore instead

00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:52,829
of that we should use responsive

00:02:47,579 --> 00:02:55,350
prototypes why because the decision

00:02:52,829 --> 00:02:57,420
decisions the decisions should be taken

00:02:55,350 --> 00:03:00,269
on the browser because at the end is

00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:02,940
where the user will consume your site so

00:03:00,269 --> 00:03:06,140
you should decide on the browser so you

00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:09,540
should go quickly to the browser and

00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:12,120
give prototypes to the to the customer

00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:15,230
because they're the customer will be

00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:17,820
able to decide if he wants that or not

00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:20,900
another thing that has changed is we

00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:24,959
don't work with lorem ipsum with custom

00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:27,329
with default content anymore because you

00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:29,970
know everything works on design all the

00:03:27,329 --> 00:03:32,850
lines for a teaser have two lines all of

00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:34,200
them works together and that's not the

00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:37,170
real life you know

00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:39,420
you have a real content and you have one

00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:42,569
teaser with only one line the next one

00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:46,200
have five lines and it's almost

00:03:42,569 --> 00:03:49,500
impossible to to make a decent design

00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:53,420
work if it doesn't been on the design

00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:57,150
for the from the from the beginning so

00:03:53,420 --> 00:04:01,830
we should we should use real content and

00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:04,799
design with extreme cases and the last

00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:06,870
year's atomic design and components have

00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:09,450
been also a thing a really a really

00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:13,610
important thing because it has changed

00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:17,850
the way we design the way we consider

00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:20,250
the web's because we don't we show them

00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:23,820
I think no pages anymore we should then

00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:25,919
give to the fight we to the final client

00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:29,639
we give them a page of course we won't

00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:31,710
give them only the a style guide but we

00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:35,910
need to think on different components to

00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:38,270
reuse them or among the side another

00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:40,530
important thing is performance and

00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:42,810
performance is really really important

00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:44,700
on responsive web design because

00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:46,979
actually actually goes what the

00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:50,130
detractors of responsibility web design

00:04:46,979 --> 00:04:51,810
used against responsive because they

00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:54,960
they say that responsive wasn't

00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:57,750
performance and actually it was like

00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:00,960
that in some kind some pages some years

00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:02,729
ago but it was unfold of the default

00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:05,310
wasn't about the responsive design it

00:05:02,729 --> 00:05:08,760
was about a ghost implementation it goes

00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:11,039
on the technique so when we talk about

00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:14,910
performance we talk about user

00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:16,830
experience because if your site is going

00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:21,750
to take more than four seconds to be

00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:23,880
load probably the surroundings the 6564

00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:28,349
percent of smartphone user will just

00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:31,020
leave your page they won't wait and bad

00:05:28,349 --> 00:05:33,660
news is that the page average is

00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:36,510
increasing year after year last year

00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:40,289
only last year it was about sixteen

00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:44,039
sixteen percent of increasing operates

00:05:40,289 --> 00:05:45,210
and the year before he was 15 so it's

00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:48,440
increasing a lot

00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:54,180
nowadays the average is around 2 dot 2

00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:58,380
megabytes and that's a lot what I really

00:05:54,180 --> 00:06:01,530
really really like on cortland about

00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:04,740
courting on performance is having a

00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:07,770
budget for performance to say okay my

00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:10,050
website will have will have around one

00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:15,389
megabyte two megabytes let's be

00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:17,430
realistic so if I did this website I

00:06:15,389 --> 00:06:20,880
really really really love it try it

00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:24,240
because its performance budget dot IO in

00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:28,169
really useful and for example if I want

00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:31,830
my site load in two seconds let's see

00:06:28,169 --> 00:06:35,310
let's say on a 3g fast 3g because not

00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:40,409
everybody have 4g but let's say a fast

00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:42,930
website how many measures are cast do

00:06:40,409 --> 00:06:48,659
you think the website to have to be

00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:55,590
load-in only two seconds any idea no no

00:06:48,659 --> 00:06:58,650
ideas 200 cash only 200 cars on a 3g

00:06:55,590 --> 00:07:01,530
it's it's science fiction I don't know

00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:04,349
you but on my in the last four years I

00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:07,409
haven't had any website just with that

00:07:04,349 --> 00:07:13,940
it's impossible just do to see that

00:07:07,409 --> 00:07:18,930
having that we should have around 125

00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:21,990
images or cash for images it's like you

00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:27,180
won't have a hero a huge hero image it's

00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:31,940
impossible with 200 cast and seven casts

00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:34,889
for CSS that's not too much and let's

00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:37,150
remember that thank us for phones I will

00:07:34,889 --> 00:07:40,210
take about land that later

00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:42,970
so when we talk about performance at

00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:46,120
these user experience we talked about

00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:49,810
the perceived performance and it will be

00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:52,990
the most critical metric because on for

00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:56,230
interactions we say that one mega I oh

00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:58,960
sorry one second an interaction happens

00:07:56,230 --> 00:08:02,190
after a before one second around one

00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:06,250
second we perceived it at immediate or

00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:09,430
between one second and ten five seconds

00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:13,090
is something that that's okay it's human

00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:15,160
interaction between 510 seconds then

00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:17,920
there's the limited span you still have

00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:20,230
the user there but but more than 10

00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:22,600
seconds then the user has gone you don't

00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:26,980
have the user there anymore or at least

00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:30,520
his attention so what can we do it will

00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:34,540
have a 2 megabytes for website and we

00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:37,000
only have two seconds what can we do the

00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:40,120
perceived performance is what is where

00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,340
it comes let's see for example you go to

00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:44,680
a bar to a restaurant and you other

00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:46,900
order something and you are waiting

00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:48,970
around 10 minutes until the that the

00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:52,330
food is there so you are like that just

00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:55,380
waiting doing nothing it will be a lot

00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:58,690
within 10 minutes but what if on the

00:08:55,380 --> 00:09:01,240
time that you get your food someone

00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:03,880
brings you your drinks and also bring

00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:06,670
you some snacks you're doing something

00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:09,390
on that time so you perceive that 10

00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:14,080
minutes in a completely different way so

00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:17,230
that's a perceived performance let's see

00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:21,400
this example I really like it because

00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:24,910
they really do it quite well it's a list

00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:28,030
apart lift up our website I'm sure some

00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:30,250
of you will know it and what they do is

00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:33,550
well at the beginning there's the the

00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:36,940
HTML call the parsers goes there and

00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:40,990
reach the CSS the jQuery and modernizer

00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:43,240
that some that some GS and one the

00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:46,360
parser and their browser render all that

00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:48,700
stuff something appears on the on the

00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:52,180
screen this something

00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:54,220
is content you can read the content but

00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:57,310
let's see here that there's no phones

00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:59,200
loaded not yet so you are reading

00:09:57,310 --> 00:10:01,150
something you can do something you

00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:03,130
actually can read the content but you

00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:04,630
don't have anything else you don't have

00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:07,000
the logo you don't have the phone you

00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:11,620
don't have anything else just the main

00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:14,830
CSS and jquery and modernizer so that's

00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:18,160
a really thing you still are doing

00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:22,210
something then other images all urges

00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:27,340
are downloaded then you have here the

00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:30,490
Lobo the Hillary merge and suddenly the

00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:32,980
text this text disappears what's that I

00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:37,660
will talk about this later but is a

00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:41,080
flash of impossible text because look

00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:44,470
here funds are being detected so the

00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:47,230
browser says I have to load the phones

00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:51,040
when I have the funds I show the funds

00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:52,930
and then other stuff is downloaded so

00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:55,420
that's that the perceived performance

00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:58,900
and that's something that we can do we

00:10:55,420 --> 00:11:02,560
can custom or south themes or CSS or

00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:04,570
implementation to do too i play with the

00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:09,070
with a perform with the perceived

00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:12,820
performance here i have a small demo

00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:18,630
with the same a 3g connection on mobile

00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:23,170
with the same a list apart website and

00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:26,260
let's see it fears is a connection there

00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:29,890
is nothing here then there is a content

00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:34,480
some GS some images that takes

00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:39,040
disappears and it's just going on

00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:41,570
everything on their own its place so

00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:44,990
yours you kind of start doing something

00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:48,380
before actually you have all the staff

00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:51,140
formula grab from the website so when we

00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:56,330
do responsive we shook that we should

00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:59,210
keep that in mind so some tips will be

00:11:56,330 --> 00:12:01,940
optimized your image files concatenate

00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:05,870
your text files your CSS javascript

00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:09,560
minify them compress them of course and

00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:12,200
catch catch everything you can so if you

00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:16,250
see that Drupal core reduce all that

00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:19,880
stuff but who works who builds websites

00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:22,430
only with Drupal core no one so there's

00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:28,040
always something that we can do to

00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:32,690
improve the implementation so if we are

00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:36,530
doing or thin we will be we will have to

00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:39,520
structure an optimized or CSS for doing

00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:43,340
that we have the CSS methodologies the

00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:45,680
object-oriented CSS been block element

00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:47,720
modifier there's a lot of stuff around

00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:50,600
that but the most important one for

00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:53,150
theming is done is a naming block

00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:56,540
element modifiers named the elements

00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:59,180
according that smacks is Morris trip to

00:12:56,540 --> 00:13:02,660
a way to structure your CSS oh you have

00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:05,240
the layout you have the each component

00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:07,910
you have the same liar so it's a good

00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:12,050
way to it's a good thing to follow to

00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:15,590
work on your sin and why are they

00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:18,620
important because you reuse your CSS if

00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:21,170
you reduce your CSS you reduce your page

00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:26,210
size and you increase the page rendering

00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:29,810
speed so it's faster you also make

00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:33,400
faster the rendering what I what do I

00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:37,520
mean if so if for example you have a

00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:39,830
glass box last child and the title

00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:41,510
inside you have that and you want to go

00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:43,550
to the title and you will see okay the

00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:45,670
browser will go will find all the boxes

00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:49,600
the last one and then

00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:52,210
still inside ya know the war the thing

00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:55,390
is not that easy the browser what we'll

00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:59,470
do is we'll find all the titles on the

00:13:55,390 --> 00:14:02,770
page then we'll find the box the last

00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:05,290
box and then it will be parsed it will

00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:07,540
be rendered so it's really really

00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:10,570
important to have only one class for

00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:14,050
each element because it will be faster

00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:17,070
for the rendering of course these

00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:20,020
methodologies make your projects are

00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:22,510
large-scale ready you can make huge

00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:24,970
projects and it helps you to figure out

00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:27,100
what your designs are going to be made

00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:28,870
of and it helps you getting started in a

00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:34,120
project because you know where the stuff

00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:36,940
will be and how it should work and style

00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:40,900
aight you know what our style guides

00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:43,630
right ok living in style guides are just

00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:45,910
a living dog in artist i'll give a

00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:50,110
living document of gold that details all

00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:53,320
the elements of your site ok from here

00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:55,510
that's ok but what happens if you go and

00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:58,870
change your CSS because something is

00:14:55,510 --> 00:15:01,570
gonna change then the style guide is all

00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:05,770
dated and an odata the style guide is a

00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:07,450
completely useful useless tool if you

00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:10,620
don't use it you don't invest your time

00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:14,740
on that but the first time you have been

00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:17,470
you you used to build that style guide

00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:21,580
it's completely useful useless than also

00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:23,140
so you must have leaving a style guide

00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:26,650
if you have living a style guide because

00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:29,050
otherwise they are useless there are

00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:30,700
different ways to implement it but the

00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:33,310
most important thing is that they give

00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:35,050
faster built and times for new sections

00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:39,310
and pages because you know where is

00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:42,220
everything where you have to go to find

00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:44,860
the way of building something it is

00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:49,610
standardized the CSS it keeps its more

00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:51,649
and the design consistency is easier

00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:55,160
and sign because you always know where

00:15:51,649 --> 00:15:58,790
to go to see what the correct title the

00:15:55,160 --> 00:16:02,300
correct color so it's easier so they are

00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:05,690
really useful if you don't use living a

00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:10,430
stylized you will end up with 50 shades

00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:16,720
of red yeah I've seen that many projects

00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:16,720
or many designs and it's often so ah

00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:22,240
wrong button

00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:27,330
nope

00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:35,079
okay another thing that we have we need

00:16:32,889 --> 00:16:40,649
to have mine is the difference between

00:16:35,079 --> 00:16:40,649
fix fix episc sales versus relative unit

00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:54,490
okay we have the pixels are the a.m and

00:16:48,279 --> 00:16:57,339
grams usually 1am and more ram is 16

00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:59,680
pixels that's the default for all

00:16:57,339 --> 00:17:06,220
browsers unless you define something

00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:13,209
else on your base team and no let's

00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:15,490
forget it and the best one between them

00:17:13,209 --> 00:17:19,179
of course we are doing responsive we

00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:21,790
don't use pixels anymore between am some

00:17:19,179 --> 00:17:24,569
trends we should use always as we can

00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:29,080
that we can we should use friends why

00:17:24,569 --> 00:17:31,210
because they are more reliable because

00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:34,720
if imagining that you have a title

00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:39,460
inside the teaser inside the sidebar and

00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:42,790
you have won that one from the previous

00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:45,820
one on that one that one am on the

00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:48,970
teaser and one not one am on the title

00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:52,179
if you don't know or do you you don't

00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:54,970
remember that you are working on AMC and

00:17:52,179 --> 00:17:57,700
you already have one dot one am on the

00:17:54,970 --> 00:18:02,830
previous element on the father element

00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:04,690
you end up with an 19 phone but if you

00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:07,570
work with friends you don't have to care

00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:10,300
about that so that's better always that

00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:12,550
you can work with Rams

00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:14,650
another thing that I love because I just

00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:17,950
discovered them one year ago and it was

00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:20,260
like where have you been is the viewport

00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:24,310
sites units that for building hero

00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:27,100
images are super useful and actually

00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:29,080
they have dinner thing for four years if

00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:33,190
an Internet Explorer works like that

00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:35,820
with that but there's a battle with with

00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:42,970
Internet Explorer they don't support

00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:48,400
vimax but here we have an example for

00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:51,340
this view / unit and another thing that

00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:53,910
it's really important on responsive

00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:58,600
design is topography and working with

00:18:53,910 --> 00:19:02,020
responsive topography how we decide

00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:04,840
which one site we should use ok we know

00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:07,510
that on that L mobiles we need to have a

00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:12,180
smaller size on TVs we need to have a

00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:15,220
bigger one but why because we decide we

00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:17,350
decide the font size depending on the

00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:21,340
user distance of the screen not the

00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:24,610
device screen itself why because you

00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:26,650
read your letter your mobile here your

00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:29,650
laptop is here and the TV is there

00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:32,740
that's why the TV needs a bigger phone

00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:35,350
than your mobile that's the why not

00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:39,480
because the device is smaller so when we

00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:43,420
decide that the size is because of that

00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:47,590
just a quick tip when we decide the font

00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:51,660
size we should be thinking about having

00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:55,390
between 14 and forty characters per line

00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:58,090
more than that is bad for the user

00:19:55,390 --> 00:20:01,870
because if you hand if you have foreign

00:19:58,090 --> 00:20:04,270
imagine 100 characters it will be hard

00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:06,790
for the user to jump to the next line

00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:08,500
because it won't be easy to find the

00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:10,870
next one because I didn't know where

00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:13,260
exactly the next one so it should be

00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:17,750
between 40 and fee and

00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:20,420
and 80 characters so what the font size

00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:24,360
fits there that's the font size you need

00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:27,000
as an generals and an average we will

00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:30,030
say that on mobiles we will use the 14

00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:35,610
pixels and 16 for the for the decks

00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:39,510
desktops some facts do you remember the

00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:44,250
200 cars that we said before on two

00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:48,680
seconds okay it goes it's about 35

00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:53,460
percent for for funds that's tankers and

00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:57,690
here we have the open sense the super

00:20:53,460 --> 00:21:02,520
used soap an open sans phone the wolf

00:20:57,690 --> 00:21:07,410
that is the the modern da the best

00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:10,470
choice its twenty three cats but that's

00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:14,100
a regular one there's the open sans

00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:18,840
italic open sans vault and open sans

00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:22,380
bold italic so just it's impossible

00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:26,130
tanker so do you do we really need funds

00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:31,980
of course all of them no I don't think

00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:36,510
so so some tips about user choosing

00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:39,920
weapons formats is that always if you

00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:43,860
it's a browser is already reading some

00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:46,890
some format don't use more format I mean

00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:49,650
for example the war everybody reads the

00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:52,980
war it's compatible with almost

00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:56,100
everything sterile internet explorer but

00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:59,040
you can use eot the old eot for internet

00:21:56,100 --> 00:22:03,840
explorer if you really have that don't

00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:06,750
use SVG you don't need it so keep the

00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:10,340
weight of the of the of your website and

00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:10,340
only use what you need

00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:17,030
do you remember the flash of impossible

00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:20,210
txt we see we saw on the on the on the

00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:23,390
demo before of that there was the flash

00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:27,380
of on a stylet text it goes the browsers

00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:30,980
that displayed that if old phone for

00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:33,830
from the system but the phone wasn't the

00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:37,100
same that you you decided for your

00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:40,220
design so suddenly when the browser got

00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:43,160
the phone everything just moved so the

00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:46,280
browser said let's remove it and when we

00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:49,600
detect that content is going to need a

00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:53,630
phone we just don't show the phone and

00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:57,560
between the the fold the FOID became

00:22:53,630 --> 00:23:00,800
that so we have fought for it and none

00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:04,390
of them is the ideal so some other stuff

00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:08,660
is going on there are some ideas like

00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:11,840
picking a phone that is really similar

00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:14,540
to your phone then adjusting it takes a

00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:18,290
little bit but that's a work in progress

00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:22,280
and there's no any standard way but the

00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:24,800
best way will be if you can use system

00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:28,670
phones use them because for example for

00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:32,080
texts they are really good some examples

00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:35,150
for some waste for adding funds to your

00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:38,300
to your website will be the phone face

00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:41,320
the it's powered by CSS is accessible

00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:43,940
you don't need a sternal plugins but

00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:47,300
usually there are two big phones and

00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:49,790
there's no common format another one

00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:51,800
will be funds.com you have a large

00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:54,790
collection you have exclusive phones

00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:57,680
like american you but you have to pay

00:23:54,790 --> 00:24:00,760
you have google fonts that it's always

00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:03,680
only CSS unless you want to use a weapon

00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:06,860
no other i think its name it really

00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:08,750
accessible it's really cached that's

00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:11,780
what i really like from google phones

00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:13,880
because it cuts to the phone if you go

00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:15,380
if you visit to one side and then you go

00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:17,610
to another site that is always also

00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:18,720
using source sons

00:24:17,610 --> 00:24:21,210
you don't need to don't know what the

00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:24,059
phone again because is already in your

00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:27,900
browser and of course it's really really

00:24:24,059 --> 00:24:30,420
easy to implement and also we have type

00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:32,580
kid we have the largest phone library

00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:38,070
there is accessible it's also clear

00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:40,110
cashed it is prone to implement and it

00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:46,520
has a premium service you have to pay

00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:51,510
and it's from out of it some tips are

00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:54,809
about the topography always try to keep

00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:57,090
the readability of your phones choose

00:24:54,809 --> 00:25:01,980
the correct font size depending on the

00:24:57,090 --> 00:25:04,770
container use less phones do we really

00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:07,440
need them maybe you need funds for your

00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:11,220
titles because they will see really good

00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:14,850
but when you are on a 14 pixels phone

00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:17,040
there's no there is no so huge

00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:21,960
difference between fonts so they will

00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:24,120
really need them for the body sure we

00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:28,500
need them

00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:30,830
and your smaller format phone formats

00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:33,450
always that you can and of course

00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:36,320
because it reduce it will reduce the

00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:36,320
page wait

00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:46,630
sorry

00:25:43,330 --> 00:25:51,420
so next step imagines they are really

00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:54,970
important on the traffic on the web I

00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:57,310
really love this because that's that's

00:25:54,970 --> 00:26:01,630
evident come on everybody knows jpg is

00:25:57,310 --> 00:26:05,410
for photos PNG is for logos or plain

00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:08,980
images PNG 24 by these four

00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:11,340
transparencies yes everybody knows we

00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:14,350
know that but not the customer I

00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:17,590
remember once when we were prepared we

00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:19,660
were the day before of the launch of a

00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:24,850
week website and I was just checking the

00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:26,590
last check and it was like wait 5 5 or 6

00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:29,590
megabytes and it was like oh my god

00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:32,260
what's going on and I realized that for

00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:34,360
that we use the default content to

00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:37,540
create some content for the website and

00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:41,230
test everything and the customer saw it

00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:44,230
and he said great i love that image so

00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:48,100
he used that but all the images were

00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:50,530
made on PNG and they were photos and we

00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:52,930
the only thing that happen is that i had

00:26:50,530 --> 00:26:56,440
to change it but because i realized

00:26:52,930 --> 00:27:00,480
about that but the custom the customer

00:26:56,440 --> 00:27:03,610
didn't so just try to keep it in mind

00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:06,670
some facts about image about images is

00:27:03,610 --> 00:27:10,090
that they are around six to one percent

00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:13,090
of the traffic on internet the browser

00:27:10,090 --> 00:27:17,740
requests the images a synchronous lead

00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:22,900
so that's great but we usually are load

00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:25,300
images too big for the device so the aim

00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:29,410
should be to deliver the highest quality

00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:33,100
images supported but nothing more not a

00:27:29,410 --> 00:27:35,230
bigger image so to dude so we have the

00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:37,900
skull scaled images we have several

00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:42,850
options but one of them is skilled

00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:46,090
images where you will work yeah we have

00:27:42,850 --> 00:27:49,600
the azure set here where we say which

00:27:46,090 --> 00:27:51,389
immature we use the sizer and full block

00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:53,729
you much

00:27:51,389 --> 00:27:56,070
and that just for changing resolutions

00:27:53,729 --> 00:28:00,089
not for changing the image only just to

00:27:56,070 --> 00:28:03,269
scale the image we also have adapted

00:28:00,089 --> 00:28:05,940
images that's a picture that you know

00:28:03,269 --> 00:28:08,999
that's for changing images for example

00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:10,649
that one is our installer horizontal and

00:28:08,999 --> 00:28:12,269
that goon is vertical and they are

00:28:10,649 --> 00:28:15,209
completely different well they are the

00:28:12,269 --> 00:28:18,809
same but they're they have different

00:28:15,209 --> 00:28:22,679
proportions so we will have we have the

00:28:18,809 --> 00:28:28,320
picture that it's supported by everyone

00:28:22,679 --> 00:28:30,899
but internet explorer and opera mini we

00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:35,359
would we have here the souls where we

00:28:30,899 --> 00:28:39,409
define the different images it for each

00:28:35,359 --> 00:28:42,599
resolution we here we use media to say

00:28:39,409 --> 00:28:47,029
the word should it be seen and we've got

00:28:42,599 --> 00:28:50,609
the full-back image here that's picture

00:28:47,029 --> 00:28:54,719
so on Drupal 8 we have responsive images

00:28:50,609 --> 00:28:58,349
the old picture in Korea it's disabled

00:28:54,719 --> 00:29:01,669
by default but it's really really quick

00:28:58,349 --> 00:29:04,609
to enable and it has its support because

00:29:01,669 --> 00:29:07,619
breakpoints are really does different

00:29:04,609 --> 00:29:11,879
resolutions and we also have lazy load

00:29:07,619 --> 00:29:15,089
and Drupal 7 is on the picture model is

00:29:11,879 --> 00:29:21,179
a country pond Drupal 8 and I have a

00:29:15,089 --> 00:29:23,459
quick example of for creating responsive

00:29:21,179 --> 00:29:26,070
images fears we just enable the model

00:29:23,459 --> 00:29:28,679
then we go and create all the images

00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:33,749
styles that we are going to use on the

00:29:28,679 --> 00:29:39,829
responsive group in that case I'm just

00:29:33,749 --> 00:29:44,039
creating the the teaser try to use it

00:29:39,829 --> 00:29:45,779
that to put the pixels on the name it

00:29:44,039 --> 00:29:51,209
really useful otherwise you can end up

00:29:45,779 --> 00:29:53,519
with 50 100 styles here i create the

00:29:51,209 --> 00:29:56,370
other ones just a little bit quickly i

00:29:53,519 --> 00:30:03,900
will love to work like that quickly

00:29:56,370 --> 00:30:06,930
and we have the three that we need we go

00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:12,330
to responsive images we create a new

00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:14,460
group we said it teaser and I choose a

00:30:12,330 --> 00:30:17,250
grow a break point group that one is

00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:22,320
from Bartok because i'm working on Marty

00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:25,740
I choose each image style for each image

00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:29,520
for each grade point and we also define

00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:33,900
a fullback image for internet explorer

00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:36,120
and friends and here we have we already

00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:39,270
have it I prepare to view a super quick

00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:42,690
view an easy hbu where I to we do start

00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:45,870
here the day much and we choose

00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:49,410
responsive format with the group teaser

00:30:45,870 --> 00:30:52,679
and that it's linked to the content I

00:30:49,410 --> 00:30:56,700
reorder it because it's nicer and that's

00:30:52,679 --> 00:31:01,140
all we have it we go here we have a list

00:30:56,700 --> 00:31:04,740
of teasers and we resize it we actually

00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:07,020
have responsive images so you see the

00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:10,080
difference between the proportions so

00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:13,470
that it's that easy now on Drupal 8 so

00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:16,410
it's really cool afraid we are really

00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:21,120
lucky to have that on Drupal we don't

00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:27,600
realize that sometimes more far far away

00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:29,660
some people have troubles with that so

00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,660
you

00:31:38,970 --> 00:31:46,830
another thing that we have on Drupal 8

00:31:41,370 --> 00:31:49,559
right now is a crop happy we have the

00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:51,929
image widget crop module that where we

00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:54,240
can the user can choose exactly what

00:31:51,929 --> 00:31:57,090
part of the image one for each in might

00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:59,250
just imagine stan sorry and we also have

00:31:57,090 --> 00:32:02,610
 focal point and it's even easier

00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:05,220
the user only choose where's got the

00:32:02,610 --> 00:32:08,419
most important part of the image and

00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:11,460
then automatically crops the image

00:32:08,419 --> 00:32:14,159
believe me it's super easy to implement

00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:19,380
and the user is like oh it's super easy

00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:21,570
drupal wow rocks so if you can use it

00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:24,360
because by default on your website if

00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:26,640
you use responsive images because it's

00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:28,950
super easy and in the implementation

00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:33,539
they're really easy to do you just

00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:37,350
choose the and instead of scale and crop

00:32:33,539 --> 00:32:39,809
use just to sign scale and crop focal

00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:44,460
point and that's the only difference so

00:32:39,809 --> 00:32:48,690
it really used it is really useful what

00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:53,549
else designers creativity there's always

00:32:48,690 --> 00:32:57,470
one more thing on design so what if your

00:32:53,549 --> 00:33:01,289
designer or mean I'm the signer also

00:32:57,470 --> 00:33:06,659
decides that on mobile he only wants on

00:33:01,289 --> 00:33:10,980
Apple so responsive images doesn't work

00:33:06,659 --> 00:33:15,330
here yeah so we need different images

00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:17,669
what we usually do is we create there's

00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:21,510
nothing else there's nothing still on

00:33:17,669 --> 00:33:25,679
Drupal 8 for that or Drupal 7 what we do

00:33:21,510 --> 00:33:27,990
is we create or one feel for each image

00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:31,140
then we create a much style for each

00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:35,520
bread point and then we prepare

00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:41,190
everything on on on Drupal 8 I on Drupal

00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:44,159
7 equals a proper process hook under

00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:47,120
late i think we you don't really don't

00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:50,430
need to prepare ate it

00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:53,250
filter but I'm not sure I done these

00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:56,160
only on Drupal 7 and you finally print

00:33:53,250 --> 00:33:58,530
it on a custom template you write the

00:33:56,160 --> 00:34:04,170
picture stuff on the template and then

00:33:58,530 --> 00:34:08,580
you have it so it's a way to solve the

00:34:04,170 --> 00:34:11,580
designers creativity what I was saying

00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:13,620
before is that there are solutions that

00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:17,310
people need because they don't work on

00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:20,940
Drupal with Drupal so there's a scaling

00:34:17,310 --> 00:34:23,810
based on their solutions that skills

00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:27,440
based on the target at end result like

00:34:23,810 --> 00:34:31,500
responsive that that I owe our other

00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:35,070
solutions there are also also solutions

00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:37,860
at scale based on the URL clothing array

00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:39,870
and all other places and there are

00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:44,070
solutions at scale based on media

00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:47,690
queries so that's there are some options

00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:51,690
out there you wanna you want to use it

00:34:47,690 --> 00:34:57,360
you can do it but Drupal just works by

00:34:51,690 --> 00:35:00,960
default SVG's I will need a complete

00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:02,700
session portal talking about that but

00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:06,390
some of the most important thing about

00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:11,000
SVG's is that they are sculling they are

00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:13,620
designed control like they have control

00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:16,860
design control like interactivity and

00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:19,050
filters they are further proof they are

00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:21,180
easy to make and to edit because they

00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:24,930
are cold and they are highly

00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:27,390
compressible and you can manipulate with

00:35:24,930 --> 00:35:31,710
CSS and JavaScript unless you're working

00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:35,100
with Internet applause so always as you

00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:37,980
can use a species don't use SVG's for

00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:40,980
photos of course but if you can use it

00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:48,720
try to use them

00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:51,470
a synchronous loading what's the default

00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:56,040
behavior for example for JavaScript

00:35:51,470 --> 00:35:59,490
there's a connection the HTML then the

00:35:56,040 --> 00:36:02,580
parser reads every line and he phones

00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:05,640
for example the CSS after these the the

00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:08,910
first JavaScript the second but after it

00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:11,820
is rendered the browser doesn't print

00:36:08,910 --> 00:36:16,020
anything so we have a problem here

00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:18,359
because we have to wait for that there

00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:20,640
are some solutions out there but it will

00:36:18,359 --> 00:36:25,220
be the default behavior you place the

00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:28,740
scrip on the head just after the the CSS

00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:31,470
but we have the the icing property that

00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:35,280
will tell to the browser that it has to

00:36:31,470 --> 00:36:38,369
be he has to be he doesn't have to wait

00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:41,130
for that it's good because while the

00:36:38,369 --> 00:36:44,490
javascript is file is loading the

00:36:41,130 --> 00:36:46,920
parsing of the document can continue the

00:36:44,490 --> 00:36:50,609
JavaScript execution no longer has to

00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:53,190
wait but you can't warranty the order of

00:36:50,609 --> 00:36:57,030
the JavaScript education the problem is

00:36:53,190 --> 00:37:01,680
that you remember that on the diet

00:36:57,030 --> 00:37:05,750
Impala die set from a list apart there

00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:08,850
was the act email the CSS jquery and

00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:11,640
modernizer because if you need some

00:37:08,850 --> 00:37:15,900
something from there you are you need to

00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:18,780
be sure they are loaded first there's

00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:22,020
another option that's a differ that

00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:24,990
proves that a little bit that's adding

00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:27,750
it just adding the property further it

00:37:24,990 --> 00:37:32,100
deferred the scripts other that affair

00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:35,880
skreets are educated only when the HTML

00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:38,609
has has been passed the first scripts

00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:41,609
will urge good only in order that they

00:37:38,609 --> 00:37:43,950
appear but it has the potential the

00:37:41,609 --> 00:37:46,350
potential to interfere with the

00:37:43,950 --> 00:37:50,109
rendering of the page so it's a little

00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:53,019
bit dangerous and of course they asking

00:37:50,109 --> 00:37:57,640
Chronos has priority so just keep that

00:37:53,019 --> 00:38:01,539
in mind that's how the does a

00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:03,489
synchronous floating cold work with the

00:38:01,539 --> 00:38:06,400
different the most common options will

00:38:03,489 --> 00:38:09,599
be just having that typical JavaScript

00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:12,369
on the on the height of your page or

00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:15,549
adding the two that JavaScript these

00:38:12,369 --> 00:38:18,549
properties you could also add the

00:38:15,549 --> 00:38:20,710
JavaScript here and of course you can

00:38:18,549 --> 00:38:22,960
add the JavaScript at the bottom of the

00:38:20,710 --> 00:38:29,680
body that those are the most common

00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:32,739
options proxy basic browsers we always

00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:40,989
forget them because come on who uses

00:38:32,739 --> 00:38:46,989
operamini again sorry who uses opera

00:38:40,989 --> 00:38:50,440
mini 250 million at least uses them okay

00:38:46,989 --> 00:38:53,170
mainly on India Indonesia and that

00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:57,309
countries maybe they are not all target

00:38:53,170 --> 00:39:00,730
but they are hard users of that so a lot

00:38:57,309 --> 00:39:02,950
of people use them so we should keep

00:39:00,730 --> 00:39:07,359
this kind of browser especially opera

00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:11,319
meaning in mind why how these browsers

00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:13,200
works they reduce the blanket that the

00:39:11,319 --> 00:39:16,029
data that the browser is going to use

00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:20,079
compressing the resources on a proxy

00:39:16,029 --> 00:39:23,619
server between the the side and the user

00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:26,079
there's a proxy server and then sense to

00:39:23,619 --> 00:39:30,779
the client just a compressed version and

00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:34,170
parts personal da on of the website to

00:39:30,779 --> 00:39:36,880
work with them we should try to use SVG

00:39:34,170 --> 00:39:40,210
rather than econ phones I don't know if

00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:42,220
you use econ phones anymore but try to

00:39:40,210 --> 00:39:44,109
use as vicious or instead of that they

00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:47,529
are super cool but they have a lot of

00:39:44,109 --> 00:39:50,499
troubles not only on open a mini but on

00:39:47,529 --> 00:39:54,130
other browsers all ways that you can

00:39:50,499 --> 00:39:56,380
style on your HTML with CSS not

00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:58,869
scrip there's your site without

00:39:56,380 --> 00:40:02,289
JavaScript because sometimes the

00:39:58,869 --> 00:40:05,230
JavaScript just disappear of course that

00:40:02,289 --> 00:40:07,930
make your site performance because they

00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:11,650
need they use over a mini because they

00:40:07,930 --> 00:40:15,519
want to use less data so making it

00:40:11,650 --> 00:40:17,700
performance better and that is abuse but

00:40:15,519 --> 00:40:21,220
tests on Oprah mean it's not that

00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:27,299
difficult to do and it can help a lot of

00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:31,920
people so I keep trying using that

00:40:27,299 --> 00:40:35,980
progressive enhancement that's a really

00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:39,160
important thing because it helps a lot

00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:42,009
this kind of user that use this kind of

00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:44,920
loser the idea is using the basic

00:40:42,009 --> 00:40:47,259
content and the basic functionality for

00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:51,039
this kind of browser like opera mini and

00:40:47,259 --> 00:40:53,680
then serve an in heitz version for a

00:40:51,039 --> 00:41:03,309
bunch of browser or the ones that have

00:40:53,680 --> 00:41:06,220
more brand which to use and beyond the

00:41:03,309 --> 00:41:10,599
mouse when we test when we develop we

00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:13,509
work with our mouths but there are toto

00:41:10,599 --> 00:41:17,309
chillin and keyboard even if we don't

00:41:13,509 --> 00:41:20,950
have the mouse on the on the on the

00:41:17,309 --> 00:41:23,890
smartphone of course so some tips to

00:41:20,950 --> 00:41:27,640
work with that is save the hover for

00:41:23,890 --> 00:41:32,410
shortcut of course the hover sometimes

00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:34,359
it really really useful but if you make

00:41:32,410 --> 00:41:38,079
for example your navigation with the

00:41:34,359 --> 00:41:41,039
hover people with smartphones will have

00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:44,349
a lot of troubles there most of the

00:41:41,039 --> 00:41:47,259
operating systems have been developing

00:41:44,349 --> 00:41:50,769
different ways because the ha the hover

00:41:47,259 --> 00:41:54,530
is two clicks on iOS for example but we

00:41:50,769 --> 00:41:57,110
save try to avoid the hover only 404

00:41:54,530 --> 00:42:00,140
kind of staff for example a different

00:41:57,110 --> 00:42:03,890
image different colors on so don't use

00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:07,010
it for important thing so be accessible

00:42:03,890 --> 00:42:10,550
in browser where most pointer monoid may

00:42:07,010 --> 00:42:14,240
not exist and don't assume that the tote

00:42:10,550 --> 00:42:16,960
will be used but design as it will be so

00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:20,030
don't design your navigation with holder

00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:26,420
another thing is keep in touch what does

00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:29,950
it means that if you put the cursor with

00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:33,320
on the side of your finger they are

00:42:29,950 --> 00:42:37,130
completely different so when you design

00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:40,310
a button for a fun smartphone forum for

00:42:37,130 --> 00:42:46,550
a mobile it should be bigger for the

00:42:40,310 --> 00:42:48,860
finger it will be 70 sorry 57 and for

00:42:46,550 --> 00:42:50,930
the soon it's even bigger because we

00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:56,080
need more space but not only for that

00:42:50,930 --> 00:42:58,520
because only be on not only because the

00:42:56,080 --> 00:43:00,500
the space you need for the finger but

00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:05,810
also because you need to have some safe

00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:08,660
space around it and another just quick

00:43:05,810 --> 00:43:12,860
tip is done over right system defaults

00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:15,170
if the system use some gesture to move

00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:17,720
to another page or to go back on the

00:43:15,170 --> 00:43:21,140
history of your browser don't overwrite

00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:25,610
it because you will annoy the user so

00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:30,920
try to avoid it and the last point is

00:43:25,610 --> 00:43:33,830
responsive design patterns patterns are

00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:36,140
really really important because we

00:43:33,830 --> 00:43:39,680
really don't need to invent the wheel on

00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:42,470
each website we design they are things

00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:47,120
that had super cool but the user needs

00:43:42,470 --> 00:43:50,570
to learn it so the less things the user

00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:53,510
needs to learn on your site more

00:43:50,570 --> 00:43:56,720
comfortable he will be there so he will

00:43:53,510 --> 00:43:58,640
stay there for more time that's really

00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:59,640
good for example for commerce don't

00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:02,130
invent and

00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:04,650
think because people needs to feel safe

00:44:02,130 --> 00:44:09,900
needs to understand everything on the

00:44:04,650 --> 00:44:12,270
first moment so design patterns are the

00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:15,630
current solutions that solve common

00:44:12,270 --> 00:44:18,800
design problems for example navigation

00:44:15,630 --> 00:44:23,700
patterns we have the typical of site

00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:26,700
navigation like Facebook that that

00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:30,800
applies to my news for tabs for example

00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:33,420
for breadcrumbs for carousels pagination

00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:37,140
always use a pattern and if you can

00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:40,020
because the user will remember it for

00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:42,510
example for forms always as you can use

00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:46,980
a pattern because the user it it will be

00:44:42,510 --> 00:44:49,200
faster for the user for dealing with

00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:52,500
data for example for slideshows for

00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:56,570
tables for autocompletes for search

00:44:52,500 --> 00:45:00,030
things always that you can try to use

00:44:56,570 --> 00:45:03,780
patterns for that also for shopping

00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:08,060
forum boarding for social then we have

00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:12,170
the progressive disclosure that's way of

00:45:08,060 --> 00:45:14,850
what it does is showing you the most

00:45:12,170 --> 00:45:18,060
normal thing the most important thing

00:45:14,850 --> 00:45:22,800
the thing that most user to on the first

00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:25,650
place for example here you have the the

00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:28,050
email so you click and you go to the to

00:45:25,650 --> 00:45:30,840
the to the mail but if you want to do

00:45:28,050 --> 00:45:34,620
more stuff you have to move on right or

00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:38,040
left and you have some chicken options

00:45:34,620 --> 00:45:43,020
so the only show the main option and

00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:48,020
then display show the other options only

00:45:43,020 --> 00:45:51,260
if the user needs them and while some

00:45:48,020 --> 00:45:55,050
conclusions about responsive nowadays

00:45:51,260 --> 00:46:00,060
keep it acting your web flow it's really

00:45:55,050 --> 00:46:03,050
good to to get new things on your web

00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:05,790
flow on your workflow keeping weight

00:46:03,050 --> 00:46:08,990
take the most of new technologies

00:46:05,790 --> 00:46:12,230
because they can help you to make

00:46:08,990 --> 00:46:15,260
everything faster keep the user in mind

00:46:12,230 --> 00:46:19,490
please at the end he will suffer your

00:46:15,260 --> 00:46:21,619
website so think on them and be prepared

00:46:19,490 --> 00:46:23,990
for the uncertain we don't know how the

00:46:21,619 --> 00:46:26,390
browsers will work in five years and

00:46:23,990 --> 00:46:30,950
probably the website will be still there

00:46:26,390 --> 00:46:34,310
and the last one keep evolving because a

00:46:30,950 --> 00:46:45,710
website is doing that all the time so
