Title: DrupalCon Dublin 2016: The Weather Company as an inspiration to extend TMGMT
Publication date: 2016-09-27
Playlist: DrupalCon Dublin 2016
Description: 
	At The Weather Company, Weather Means Business. Its complex weather data and forecast technology is available in 2.2 billion locations, and is updated every 15 minutes. This is no small feat, especially when you have to deliver a variety of content (including news, health and travel articles) in over 35 languages. To keep up with the business, Weather's IT department is developing against agile development principles. Smartling has been working with The Weather Company to achieve agility for localization.



Smartling has learned a lot from the partnership with The Weather Company. It has advanced the company's vision for how translation at scale can be optimized. Smartling decided to use TMGMT for its Drupal 8 integration.Â Meet Smartling, and hear about our vision on extending this awesome module.


This session is for business and technical users of Drupal who are curious to learn how the largest user of Drupal manages local language content with minimal IT effort and resources to manage translation. Attendees will walk away empowered to think differently about how translation is changing with software.

good afternoon everyone thanks for

00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:07,950
coming my name is Riley and solution

00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:11,070
architect with smartly and i'm joined by

00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:12,660
costia glue shock who is a member of our

00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:14,910
development team and here's work

00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:18,840
specifically on spirelings Drupal

00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:21,779
integration we're going to cover three

00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:23,519
things in this session I'm going to talk

00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:25,140
a little bit about smarting just by way

00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:26,039
of background tell you a little case

00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:28,109
you're not familiar with what's

00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:32,880
marketing is a little bit about what we

00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:35,070
do then talk about whether calm and a

00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:38,399
little bit of it their story and how to

00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:39,780
use smarting today and and then I'm

00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,370
going to turn over the cost jet and he's

00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:44,640
going to talk about what we're doing

00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:46,649
it's in Drupal 8 so the work that were

00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:54,390
actively engaged in now and looking

00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:55,980
forward so with that Oh first of all if

00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:59,520
you want presentation online there's a

00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:02,699
short link for a second just to mention

00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:06,650
as well that smart lling has a booth in

00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:06,650
the downstairs

00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:19,470
a little bit about smartlink smartening

00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:22,650
is a cloud-based software platform for

00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:24,660
managing the workflow around translation

00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:26,370
human translation for the most part we

00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:29,910
do integrate with machine translation

00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:31,880
but it's mainly a platform to tackle the

00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:35,460
challenges that traditionally plagued

00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:39,150
the business of translating content and

00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:41,729
applications if any of you have ever

00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:43,860
been involved in translation projects

00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:46,170
you've probably got some horrible

00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:47,880
memories associated with it because

00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:51,840
usually there's copying and pasting

00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:54,330
involved is usually putting stuff into

00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:57,930
spreadsheets emailing spreadsheets to

00:01:54,330 --> 00:02:01,530
translation providers they in turn email

00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:03,000
it on to translators translator has to

00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:06,660
do their work with a big list of words

00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,000
and no context of where the content will

00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:11,180
actually live so they end up making

00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:15,270
mistakes or doing poor translations and

00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:17,269
there's a you know the process around

00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:22,020
fixing those is slow laborious

00:02:17,269 --> 00:02:25,230
error-prone and

00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:26,880
it's slow and it's costly as well and

00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:32,150
it's kind of painful for everyone

00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:34,800
involved smartlink addresses this

00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:36,360
traditional mass by providing a single

00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:40,620
platform that everyone involved in the

00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:43,650
process logs in to end users so company

00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:45,510
side project managers log in to smart

00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:47,370
laying and manage their content we can

00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:50,520
see what's going on on the translator

00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:52,380
side a translator also logs in like

00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:55,080
great tools the translator in terms of

00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:58,410
visual contact so you can see they're

00:02:55,080 --> 00:03:02,100
doing to get with translations first

00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:04,980
time we manage translation memory a lot

00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:06,540
of the things that are the kind of state

00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:07,620
of the art for translational work so

00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:11,370
they're all available in the platform

00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:13,380
and in addition to that and a bit more

00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:15,360
relevant to the roof of conversation as

00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:18,590
we also provide methods of integrating

00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:20,910
with places where a content comes from

00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:23,300
application development systems content

00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:25,470
management systems so instead of

00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:26,850
developers having to copy and paste up

00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:28,680
into spreadsheets smartening

00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:32,390
automatically collects the content and

00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:34,709
just remove that from on the picture so

00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:39,690
so that's that's kind of what we do we

00:03:34,709 --> 00:03:43,410
have this base it's a browser-based

00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:45,120
interface different people logging and

00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:48,080
see different views depending on their

00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:50,190
role contents coming in automatically

00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:59,340
translators work in this platform as

00:03:50,190 --> 00:04:02,220
well platform we provide but actually

00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:03,660
what I'll do is I've highlighted I don't

00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:05,790
want this is not about smart lling it's

00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:07,950
more about the the integration work with

00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:09,180
quadruple but I've a couple of features

00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:11,340
that I'm just going to quickly go

00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:13,620
through to give you a better feel for

00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:14,520
what's Martling is about and then we'll

00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:18,350
switch to talk

00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:22,110
rather one of them is I mentioned this

00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:24,300
context IDs so that what we try to do in

00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:26,820
smartening is in addition to supplying

00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:29,820
the content to the translator to work on

00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:31,830
we also give them the visual context

00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:34,170
that will ultimately live an so it's on

00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:35,820
web page they'll see that actual web

00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:38,430
page if it's describing a product

00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:41,190
they'll see the product and so can do a

00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:45,750
high quality translation first time in

00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:47,550
addition to that they as they do their

00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:49,500
work they'll see the translation appear

00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:51,300
in the content of all so if the

00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:53,040
translation is going to introduce any

00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:54,870
layout issues they have a better chance

00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:58,680
to Spartan them right off the bat as

00:04:54,870 --> 00:05:00,960
opposed to seeing them QA cycle weeks or

00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:03,720
months later and so that's a little

00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:10,020
glimpse of the in context interface and

00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:12,480
snorkeling they also have in this

00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:14,490
interface translation memory so that

00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:16,080
anything that's previously even

00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:18,800
translated they'll have access to and in

00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:24,140
this interface that prompted that this

00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:24,140
translated and it allows for faster

00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:31,910
costs so switching to a completely

00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:34,780
different things another capability that

00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:39,080
smartlink has is what we call the GDN

00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:41,569
and this is a proxy based approach to

00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:44,690
translating websites a web content so if

00:05:41,569 --> 00:05:48,800
you didn't want to do translations and

00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:50,840
managed to translations at your site we

00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,370
can instead let's say leave your site in

00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:54,830
whatever language it's in let's say your

00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:58,610
store site is in English through this

00:05:54,830 --> 00:06:01,490
proxy the way translation would work is

00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:03,139
when somebody requests a translated

00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:04,610
version of your website the requests

00:06:03,139 --> 00:06:08,870
will actually go through the SmartLink

00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:11,659
proxy go to your English site the

00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:15,979
English page and all the translations

00:06:11,659 --> 00:06:17,720
this happens really fast and really in a

00:06:15,979 --> 00:06:21,560
scalable way as well so this for example

00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:22,550
is we've got some very large websites

00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:24,620
that are using this approach to

00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:26,659
translation but it's only one approach

00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:28,610
we maybe have our customers do do things

00:06:26,659 --> 00:06:37,940
this way and the other half do the

00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:39,380
translation at source just mentioned one

00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:43,130
last thing there's a lot of things

00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:45,500
really we could we could highlight this

00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:49,340
is just a recent thing so I picked it

00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:52,550
out as well sometimes when a translator

00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:54,770
needs context there's no HTML context

00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:57,380
today a little bit maybe a screenshot or

00:06:54,770 --> 00:07:00,740
a design from a designer that that

00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:02,509
exists as an image and so we also have

00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:04,139
the avail of two different approaches to

00:07:02,509 --> 00:07:05,580
get in context in

00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:07,800
but this is a new one we added recently

00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:11,849
where he load an image into smart thing

00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:13,439
will automatically do OCR on the image

00:07:11,849 --> 00:07:16,069
and extract all of the content to be

00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:16,069
translated

00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:34,110
so switching to to the weather story in

00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:35,310
2014 weather com was based on you

00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:39,150
probably know that they're the largest

00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:42,200
traffic trafficked Drupal based website

00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:46,140
in the world they have over a billion

00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:48,360
page views a month i believe so very

00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:51,540
very scared very large site and the way

00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:54,000
it used to work was it was based on Java

00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:57,890
framework and all of the content was

00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:00,690
stored in Java properties files and

00:07:57,890 --> 00:08:02,700
process by which they translated this

00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:04,410
content into other languages was exactly

00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:06,750
the one that I was describing at the

00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:09,540
beginning they had members of their

00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:11,730
development team literally going through

00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:13,830
these property files and copy copying

00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:16,680
content and pasted into spreadsheets

00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:18,720
which then were emailed off to

00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:20,610
translation agencies this is how the

00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:23,130
translation process happened and this is

00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:26,520
a common process actually you can got

00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:29,100
seen so old school so that that's the

00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:34,080
way they were doing things then it was

00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:35,940
very slow it was expensive they had a

00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,620
good number a half a dozen developers

00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:39,300
that spent a good portion of their time

00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:43,440
on this type of work which that's an

00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:46,080
expensive use of your developers and and

00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:52,770
so they embarked on a process of

00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:55,020
changing this 2014 they re architected

00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:57,570
the weather com one thing I didn't

00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:59,400
mention as well is that whole copy paste

00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:02,610
thing that was repeated multiple times

00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:06,660
for different environment so the angular

00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:08,490
app the windows are the iphone app all

00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:11,370
of these went through the same process

00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:15,660
in many times with exactly the same

00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:17,970
content so find also adding to the cost

00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:20,310
so they went to a riorca textured

00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:24,360
process of their English sighs changed

00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:26,880
it to be based on the angular mods so

00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:30,810
Drupal and the angular mods in Drupal

00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:33,960
and did that for English and what you

00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:36,270
see here is a new version of their site

00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:38,970
as of I guess it would have been it came

00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:42,630
out in late 2014 the English version and

00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:44,100
then they said we we want now to we need

00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:45,900
to update our internationalization

00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:47,850
process of the international sites were

00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:49,830
all still on the old approach with the

00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:53,150
copying and pasting and everything and

00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:55,890
so they went to an evaluation process to

00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:59,310
choose a translation management platform

00:09:55,890 --> 00:10:01,110
the ended up choosing smartlink for many

00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:03,420
of the things I spoke about earlier but

00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:07,560
also because we have an integration with

00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:09,390
Drupal which they started to use they

00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:13,230
they had some additional requirements

00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:16,410
which are shown here because of their

00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:20,040
particular custom way of using the

00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:21,540
angular mods that they that was not

00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:22,740
something we initially supported out of

00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:24,510
the box so we did some custom

00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:27,060
development to allow them to translate

00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:31,010
that type of content from Drupal they

00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:33,180
also had a requirement to allow

00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:34,890
translation submissions to happen from

00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:37,350
multiple different environments so that

00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:39,030
a developer is Drupal environment for

00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:42,090
example could be used as a source for

00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:43,860
content to send for translation once the

00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:48,170
translations were complete they could be

00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:48,170
downloaded into other environments

00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:54,210
and so that was kind of a new flow as

00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:56,490
well it should traditionally in when

00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:58,050
we're connected with content management

00:10:56,490 --> 00:11:00,330
systems like that usually the

00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:02,160
translations go back to the same system

00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:06,300
that they originated from so this was a

00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:12,150
new requirement in Drupal some

00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:15,840
modifications on our side so this is an

00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:19,980
example of what that interface looks

00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:22,020
like in Drupal we have connectors for a

00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:25,650
variety of different content management

00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:27,180
platforms they all they all look more

00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:29,640
like the platform so that this should

00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:31,350
look like a Drupal interface but the

00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:34,140
flow the content flow is largely the

00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:35,970
same so you can see on the left it's

00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:37,350
been filtered allows you to search for

00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:41,130
the content that you want to translate

00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:45,900
it and filter to this weekend forecast

00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:48,930
app select that you press the translate

00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:52,260
button and then you're led to this page

00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:54,180
where you can choose the languages see

00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:55,740
when it comes a very large set of

00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:58,470
languages if you're trying setting into

00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:59,940
but it gives you the option to spec to

00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:01,920
choose a subset of languages if a

00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:04,710
particular application say it's only

00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:06,390
available in certain countries so the

00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:07,590
flow is simple you find the content you

00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:10,230
search for the content press the

00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:12,660
translate button and choose your

00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:14,700
languages and off it goes and whence the

00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:17,250
translations and so once it goes into

00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:18,540
smartlink then translators are notified

00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:20,250
that content is available for

00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:21,810
translation they'll immediately login

00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:23,910
start working on it and you have fast

00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:25,680
turnaround

00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:27,480
the translations when the translations

00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,340
are complete they're automatically

00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:32,120
downloaded and incorporated into the

00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:32,120
right place

00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:40,600
in addition to the bathtub of flow

00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:44,130
there's also this kind of a status view

00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:46,630
that allows you to see at a glance the

00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:50,980
progress on all of the translations that

00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:52,900
have been submitted from smartly these

00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:54,580
this particular screenshot happens to

00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:56,070
show all under percent but you know it's

00:12:54,580 --> 00:13:01,360
more typically you'd see varying

00:12:56,070 --> 00:13:05,380
percentages along the right here as well

00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:06,730
the different types of content once

00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:09,040
there you have the ability to download

00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:11,410
translations manually but the more

00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:13,240
typical flow particularly for a large

00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:21,760
site is you just let them come back in

00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:24,940
automatically so they've been whether

00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:28,540
they've successfully implemented this

00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:30,970
they they went for a world where it was

00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:33,100
taken them a long time to translate and

00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:35,650
they were using half a dozen developers

00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:39,220
in managing the process and was very

00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:41,260
error-prone to a process where they can

00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:44,080
simultaneously deploy into more than 35

00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:46,900
languages they don't need any developer

00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:50,700
resources so it's just content people

00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:52,780
can manage this from a Drupal interface

00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:55,120
you know they've got to do some examples

00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:56,410
of the particular app on the left and

00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,270
english translated into various

00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:59,980
languages Chinese right-to-left

00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:05,140
languages represented there as well

00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:06,970
Arabic the other thing that they get

00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:08,380
from this they Compton coming from all

00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:11,110
of the different applications is they

00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:14,770
get this very high translation memory

00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:16,330
leverage so once they're you know if

00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:17,830
they've translated content for their

00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:21,190
iphone app there's a lot of the same

00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:23,740
content in android so that will that can

00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:26,260
skip the translation process completely

00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:27,990
if that if they choose configurability

00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:30,940
around how what they want to do with

00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:33,490
translation memory matches but that's

00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:35,890
something where it makes the whole

00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:38,860
translation process faster and more

00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:39,170
consistent and a lot cheaper too because

00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:41,240
you're

00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:43,550
using translations that have been have

00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:46,730
been done before and are using this

00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:48,649
submit from multiple places and download

00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:51,019
into different environments process as

00:14:48,649 --> 00:14:53,089
well so they're really they view it as a

00:14:51,019 --> 00:14:55,310
great success that they're now able to

00:14:53,089 --> 00:14:57,589
do translation work in a kind of an

00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:59,510
agile it fits into they were shifting to

00:14:57,589 --> 00:15:01,339
a more agile development model and this

00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:09,079
kind of approach to managing their

00:15:01,339 --> 00:15:11,899
content and translations fits now so

00:15:09,079 --> 00:15:15,430
that's I'll stop here and just say ask

00:15:11,899 --> 00:15:15,430
if there are any questions at this point

00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:32,660
yeah actually and correct me so the

00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:34,040
question was content can be created on

00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:37,699
staging and then it'll be sent to

00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:39,769
production so the normal flow with a

00:15:37,699 --> 00:15:41,540
smart link connector is it would be if

00:15:39,769 --> 00:15:43,040
it was created on staging then the

00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:45,440
translations would go back to staging

00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:47,269
and you manage yourself to push it to

00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:50,600
production in the appropriate way but

00:15:47,269 --> 00:15:52,220
this also supports a model where the

00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:54,709
translations are the content is created

00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:56,839
on stage and pushed to production push

00:15:54,709 --> 00:15:58,160
to smart lling and when the translations

00:15:56,839 --> 00:16:01,300
are complete they can be downloaded

00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:01,300
directly into

00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:06,850
questions

00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:13,440
okay so at this point then so that

00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:16,589
everything we've spoken about so far is

00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:19,430
based on Drupal 7 we're also very

00:16:16,589 --> 00:16:22,680
actively working on google H and

00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:24,870
hostages the man doing the work so he's

00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:27,990
going to tell you a little bit about the

00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:30,139
work we're doing on this place in Japan

00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:35,069
thank you everyone for joining us today

00:16:30,139 --> 00:16:38,370
so first about p.m. gmt and i'd like to

00:16:35,069 --> 00:16:41,939
say that we decided to go fully with k

00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:44,639
MGMT as our the quadruple a solution for

00:16:41,939 --> 00:16:47,490
the integration it was somewhat hard

00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:50,250
decision you know as we did this

00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:52,769
decision after drupalcon your limbs and

00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:55,290
some internal discussions but by that

00:16:52,769 --> 00:16:58,680
time we already had a release candidate

00:16:55,290 --> 00:17:02,300
one of our customs beginning integration

00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:05,789
for Drupal 8 so we always spend quite a

00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:09,150
force for that but anyway we decided to

00:17:05,789 --> 00:17:12,510
switch to t MGMT and there were several

00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:15,510
reasons to do so and let me share those

00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:20,339
reasons with you the first reason was

00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:22,949
that it is a well-tested module we with

00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:26,850
a big community and even at this point

00:17:22,949 --> 00:17:30,150
the core is real well tested the second

00:17:26,850 --> 00:17:34,470
one is that after the activity of

00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:37,860
development pace it has really nice EP

00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:41,309
is that allow flexible extension of the

00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:43,340
T MGMT module and that we could use to

00:17:41,309 --> 00:17:46,260
implement the needed features and the

00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:48,179
third one is that which will believe

00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:52,409
that we cannot only successfully use

00:17:48,179 --> 00:17:54,299
this module for the integration but we

00:17:52,409 --> 00:17:58,909
think that we can bring in some new

00:17:54,299 --> 00:17:58,909
features that everyone can benefit from

00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:05,680
and before i continue I'd like to say

00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:08,410
say thanks to all the team gym GM

00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:12,850
maintain errs that put their hard work

00:18:08,410 --> 00:18:15,910
into this module you know having written

00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:19,810
the module with similar functionality

00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:22,330
for both Drupal 7 and drupal 8 we think

00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:25,360
that we can really imagine what a big

00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:27,640
and great we support it is and so we

00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:30,550
would really like to thank the

00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:36,180
maintenance for all their hard work and

00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:36,180
that they may these our decisions happen

00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:44,050
and now a few words about the state of

00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:46,660
our own custom Tian Jing Zhi smarting

00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:50,010
plugin so right now its production ready

00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:52,390
it allows you to implement all the basic

00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:54,130
manipulations with content you can

00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:57,250
upload the content to smart link and

00:18:54,130 --> 00:19:00,580
download a translation back but right

00:18:57,250 --> 00:19:03,010
now we're working on a new really cool

00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:05,230
feature for do plate which is called

00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:08,470
translation context and kind of

00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:12,040
mentioned this featuring his part of the

00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:15,520
presentation so soon translators in

00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:18,700
Drupal 8 will be able to immediately see

00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:22,120
how their translation looks on the real

00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:25,600
side we do this by capturing the actual

00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:29,200
HTML of the page and sending it to smart

00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:31,600
link and then showing the actual HTML of

00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:35,050
the page inside inside the SmartLink

00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:37,150
dashboards and that's why how it happens

00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:38,920
internally and this feature might be

00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:41,530
really useful for example for German

00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:46,060
language this language is known for

00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:49,540
really long words and sometimes these

00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:52,690
one words can fit into certain parts of

00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:55,690
the page so instead of going through the

00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:57,490
whole loop of the testing process after

00:19:55,690 --> 00:20:00,850
you downloaded the in translation back

00:19:57,490 --> 00:20:04,930
then you go like give the sides to your

00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:08,110
testers and they mark a bug that some

00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:11,020
string doesn't fit now they can easily

00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:13,360
see it right away and frigerator can try

00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:16,900
to split his translation into

00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:24,850
several smaller words and so it would

00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:27,100
look nice in the UI so when while

00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:30,040
working on the integration with

00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:32,440
weather.com and their amount above of

00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:35,140
both content and locales we learned

00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:37,270
several important languages while

00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:40,390
working with them and we think that we

00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:43,630
could bring these important lessons to

00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:45,880
the T MGMT ecosystem and in order to do

00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:48,700
so we started the new project which is

00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:52,780
called MGMT extension suit it's module

00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:55,480
on drupal.org right now it's not yet

00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:57,460
production-ready it's more like work in

00:20:55,480 --> 00:21:00,880
progress but I think it will be worth

00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:03,429
checking by the end of this year it's

00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:06,340
also worth mentioning that we see this

00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:09,340
project as a vendor agnostic too so

00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:13,410
hopefully anyone who is using key MGMT

00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:18,730
may benefit from this project and now

00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:21,850
I'll tell you about a story of how would

00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:26,700
you translate actually besides using t

00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:30,880
MGMT and hopefully our new extension

00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:33,790
yeah so imagine that you've got a

00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:39,160
customer that you created a site for him

00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:41,500
these customers called fantastic and so

00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:43,990
we created a site for him he was happy

00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:46,090
with the side and he knows that that

00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:48,940
side started to bring in new business

00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:51,520
and so the customer decided to go

00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:55,120
multilingual and try a new lacaille on

00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:57,910
the side in order to fulfill this

00:21:55,120 --> 00:22:02,320
requirement you install the usual key

00:21:57,910 --> 00:22:04,780
MGMT module on this side and create all

00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:07,740
the translation jobs that send it to the

00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:11,679
translator provider of your choice and

00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:13,990
in approximately in a week when all the

00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:17,140
translation happened you expect the

00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:20,220
content to return to you through your

00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:23,890
site but that that doesn't happen and

00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:26,890
during the bank you find out that the

00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:29,740
reason for that is that you use the

00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:32,890
environment of your site in order to be

00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:36,850
able to test the translation afterwards

00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:39,010
and it appeared that you use the HTTP

00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:42,220
authentication on your site and thus

00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:45,460
this site is not available outside and

00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:49,240
so the default mechanism for pulling the

00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:53,620
translation back for for the side and in

00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:55,330
TMG mdm2 module is the download call

00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:57,730
back it doesn't work because the

00:22:55,330 --> 00:23:01,360
server's of your provider can't reach

00:22:57,730 --> 00:23:03,730
the side and you really in this

00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:06,850
situation you don't have like many

00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:10,090
options to choose you would need to go

00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:12,970
inside each job the translation job and

00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:15,940
beside that you have and one by one

00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:19,720
click the download button manually to

00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:22,780
get a translation back what we see we

00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:25,570
improve here is to actually improve the

00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:28,840
integration between the T MGMT module

00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:32,130
and the video modules that could leave

00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:36,040
together and essentially we think that

00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:39,820
the download action and reupload action

00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:43,750
would be really helpful helpful in such

00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:46,240
cases as I've just described there are

00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:50,980
also some other take actions like the

00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:56,400
council job and so like the delete job I

00:23:50,980 --> 00:24:00,880
believe but we think that the fat

00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:08,880
content managing actions are the vital

00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:11,170
here and so some some time passes and we

00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:14,230
you know we live in a rapidly changing

00:24:11,170 --> 00:24:18,340
world and some content of your client

00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:20,770
becomes outdated so he wants to fix this

00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:23,800
situation goes to the side and changes

00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:27,100
the contents and now you need as a

00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:30,100
developer to update translation right

00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:32,920
now in order to do so in kinky we've got

00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:35,560
two options to do so the first one is

00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:37,300
you can create new jobs and send them

00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:39,040
again for translation and then don't

00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:40,509
download them back and then you will

00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:43,539
have the translation

00:24:40,509 --> 00:24:45,489
and the second option is the pretty much

00:24:43,539 --> 00:24:47,979
new feature into MGMT that is called

00:24:45,489 --> 00:24:54,219
continuous translation this feature

00:24:47,979 --> 00:24:56,799
allows you to configure a bundle that

00:24:54,219 --> 00:24:59,739
will be automatically sent for

00:24:56,799 --> 00:25:04,809
translation and then download it back

00:24:59,739 --> 00:25:07,779
and the issue with such approach as we

00:25:04,809 --> 00:25:11,829
see it is that you you know long longer

00:25:07,779 --> 00:25:15,099
be able to select which nodes or other

00:25:11,829 --> 00:25:17,829
content pieces of content you want to

00:25:15,099 --> 00:25:19,929
translate inside this bundle and which

00:25:17,829 --> 00:25:22,239
you don't so for example if you got the

00:25:19,929 --> 00:25:24,399
bundle article yeah the notes article or

00:25:22,239 --> 00:25:27,609
the basic page and you want to translate

00:25:24,399 --> 00:25:30,699
some some of the those pages and others

00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:34,659
you want to leave not translated for now

00:25:30,699 --> 00:25:38,319
you like this is not the option and what

00:25:34,659 --> 00:25:41,679
we implemented in Drupal 7 and right now

00:25:38,319 --> 00:25:45,190
working on in Drupal 8 is the tracking

00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:48,309
changes on a per node node basis for

00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:51,699
jobs for her job basis so if any piece

00:25:48,309 --> 00:25:54,639
of content inside the job was changed we

00:25:51,699 --> 00:25:58,899
will catch the moment when it was

00:25:54,639 --> 00:26:01,619
changed and uploaded reuploaded again to

00:25:58,899 --> 00:26:06,749
the translation provider so the

00:26:01,619 --> 00:26:06,749
translation could be updated immediately

00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:22,290
yeah and and finally be in sometime if

00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:26,880
everything goes well with your fantastic

00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:30,960
customer and his business grows he may

00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:35,180
want to go truly multilingual and add

00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:39,630
six more like else to his side right and

00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:44,040
right now MGMT allows only to create

00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:47,160
jobs or on a per one lacaille basis so

00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:52,190
in this case you would need to go to

00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:56,520
your site administrative interface and

00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:58,140
create all the jobs that you created for

00:26:56,520 --> 00:27:01,890
the first language you would need to

00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:05,460
recreate them for each new locale and it

00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:09,180
might be kind of tiresome there is

00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:11,730
actually the cart feature in the T MGMT

00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:14,730
module where you could select multiple

00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:17,040
locales for your job but after you

00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:20,210
select them you would need to click

00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:20,210
through the

00:27:22,029 --> 00:27:29,049
through all the job creation process so

00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:31,210
if you got 60 kills then you would need

00:27:29,049 --> 00:27:36,669
to click through six forms for each

00:27:31,210 --> 00:27:41,349
locale to create a job for each okay and

00:27:36,669 --> 00:27:44,249
instead we we will work on making this

00:27:41,349 --> 00:27:48,429
process more transparent and allow to

00:27:44,249 --> 00:27:51,029
trade create all those jobs from a

00:27:48,429 --> 00:27:51,029
single page

00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:59,480
yes so this is our basic road road map

00:27:56,780 --> 00:28:02,060
for the nearest future our top three

00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:05,450
features and everything else will be

00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:11,060
prioritized after we implement these

00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:14,030
ones it's a matter as I said we would

00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:18,620
expect it to be more or less finished by

00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:22,910
the end of all this year and maybe after

00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:26,300
that we would bring me some cues and

00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:29,990
that we had in Drupal 7 or URL rewrite

00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:35,180
we're inside for example your body field

00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:38,840
you've got some URLs that link from one

00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:41,870
page to another and or or the images the

00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:43,880
link links to the images and the common

00:28:41,870 --> 00:28:49,030
use case is that when you want to

00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:53,300
localize those images so instead of one

00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:57,620
HTML link inside the battlefield you

00:28:53,300 --> 00:29:01,310
would like to link it to some other

00:28:57,620 --> 00:29:03,770
place and sorry in this transformation

00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:06,680
should happen according to some rules

00:29:03,770 --> 00:29:09,700
and so in Drupal 7 we provided some

00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:12,950
eTI's that would allow this feature and

00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:20,180
that is definitely somewhere on our road

00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:23,570
map but again some were so I think

00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:26,570
that's it from my side thank you for

00:29:23,570 --> 00:29:29,960
your attention and if you have any

00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:33,200
questions please ask them I may also

00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:36,500
mention that we like finish a bit early

00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:38,330
but we we we thought that we would have

00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:41,660
only 30 minutes for this presentation

00:29:38,330 --> 00:29:44,000
and only recently we got to know that it

00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:46,070
will be the whole hour so questions are

00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,340
really welcome thank thank you for your

00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:48,340
attention

00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:14,440
no no we don't plan to that party for

00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:16,870
drupal 7 as we've gotten so it's like

00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:20,620
more of the client requests based so

00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:22,780
itself if some of our clients want so we

00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:26,410
don't have right now the roadmap for

00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:29,820
Drupal 7 but we've got some incoming

00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:33,309
requests from our customers and if we

00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:44,080
solve that then we prioritize them and

00:30:33,309 --> 00:30:47,380
give them some resources no there is an

00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:51,280
Drupal 7 and I'm not sure about their

00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:53,260
plans towards the plate but as as far as

00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:59,260
you know they are the media card

00:30:53,260 --> 00:31:03,549
framework they sit on was involved lots

00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:05,650
of work so maybe they won't be like the

00:31:03,549 --> 00:31:07,860
early boards for Drew play adoption at

00:31:05,650 --> 00:31:07,860
least

00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:35,010
yeah so basically we've got clients that

00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:38,280
at least in Drupal 7 use both of our

00:31:35,010 --> 00:31:40,770
plugin and workbook workbench moderation

00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:46,650
and essential we don't think lands the

00:31:40,770 --> 00:31:50,670
state of the workbench so for us if you

00:31:46,650 --> 00:31:55,410
are talking about the tracking changes

00:31:50,670 --> 00:32:01,200
right feature and there so there we in

00:31:55,410 --> 00:32:04,740
no way like deal with the states of the

00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:09,720
workbench motivation for us the final T

00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:14,580
stage all of the original content is the

00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:18,440
one where the like the admin of the site

00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:21,660
or the content editor first uploaded

00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:24,900
some piece of content content to smartly

00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:27,570
so before it happened we do not track

00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:31,380
track changes for these piece of content

00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:36,090
but after the first episode we think

00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:38,130
that we should get to know about the

00:32:36,090 --> 00:32:44,160
updates and the content as soon as we

00:32:38,130 --> 00:32:45,780
can essentially if for example the some

00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:50,490
piece of content was uploaded to

00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:52,650
smarting and then summer was founded was

00:32:50,490 --> 00:32:55,170
found in those piece of content in

00:32:52,650 --> 00:32:57,420
quickly fix and it can happen that

00:32:55,170 --> 00:33:01,380
translator didn't even start to

00:32:57,420 --> 00:33:07,260
translate this node so this way we will

00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:09,330
be able to fix the the typos before

00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:12,710
before the translation and so the client

00:33:09,330 --> 00:33:17,420
won't need to pay for that translation

00:33:12,710 --> 00:33:17,420
the Sun does answer your question

00:33:32,619 --> 00:33:38,659
so the question is is the translation

00:33:36,139 --> 00:33:44,659
context something specific to us or is

00:33:38,659 --> 00:33:47,320
it sits in the extension suit so the

00:33:44,659 --> 00:33:50,539
answer is that it is specific for our

00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:55,220
connector and the reason for these is

00:33:50,539 --> 00:33:58,249
that it is not only the Drupal side so

00:33:55,220 --> 00:34:01,039
the code on the Drupal site but these

00:33:58,249 --> 00:34:04,909
are pretty much specificity is on the

00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:08,270
server side and a bunch of the

00:34:04,909 --> 00:34:11,990
communications between our servers and

00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:16,460
Drupal before we actually gather the

00:34:11,990 --> 00:34:20,419
whole page together and so it could be

00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:25,270
properly displayed for the translator

00:34:20,419 --> 00:34:29,929
and we've got some doubts that other

00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:33,169
like providers can easily implement the

00:34:29,929 --> 00:34:36,260
same server ap is so this could be

00:34:33,169 --> 00:34:40,819
useful for them but on the other hand

00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:46,490
you know all of our code is open source

00:34:40,819 --> 00:34:50,450
it leaves on drupal.org so if any LSP

00:34:46,490 --> 00:34:53,260
things that they can implement the same

00:34:50,450 --> 00:34:57,559
feature on their side they can easily

00:34:53,260 --> 00:35:00,200
just for call our code or like grab the

00:34:57,559 --> 00:35:03,500
needed piece from our code look how we

00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:06,220
implemented it and use it for their own

00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:06,220
benefit

00:35:42,910 --> 00:35:48,910
yeah so the question is why did we go

00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:52,430
with a separate project rather than

00:35:48,910 --> 00:35:58,070
countries into MGMT and the answer is

00:35:52,430 --> 00:36:00,170
that we wanted to stay more agile here

00:35:58,070 --> 00:36:03,140
and I think you can think of this module

00:36:00,170 --> 00:36:10,850
as the experimental modules for Drupal 8

00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:13,970
core so you know the T MGMT module has

00:36:10,850 --> 00:36:20,480
lots of stakeholders and people that are

00:36:13,970 --> 00:36:25,520
dependent on it and so there might be

00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:28,940
even some argue on how should it better

00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:32,810
implement the integration between vbo in

00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:36,320
p.m. gmt and it can take some time so we

00:36:32,810 --> 00:36:39,740
decided to that it might be better for

00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:43,280
everyone for us to implement it more or

00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:47,540
less quickly and then share it with

00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:50,810
everyone else and then discuss the

00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:53,540
existing implementation rather than some

00:36:50,810 --> 00:36:55,960
theoretical maybe approaches on how to

00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:55,960
do it better

00:37:48,910 --> 00:37:59,269
yes so the question is how smarting

00:37:53,869 --> 00:38:01,309
influence the tea MGMT module I think

00:37:59,269 --> 00:38:04,130
that the ants were here is that well

00:38:01,309 --> 00:38:08,950
first of all 80 MGMT module has I think

00:38:04,130 --> 00:38:08,950
really really strong stick the holders

00:38:10,119 --> 00:38:18,859
by the md systems company which is

00:38:13,489 --> 00:38:23,660
really huge their second contributor

00:38:18,859 --> 00:38:29,749
they have a really nice view of where

00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:32,960
they're going and I think the opinion is

00:38:29,749 --> 00:38:36,440
definitely not easy to infants in some

00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:39,410
way we can only in a way help and add

00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:48,710
something that that we think it is

00:38:39,410 --> 00:38:54,609
important so from what we see maybe we

00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:54,609
could add a little bit in terms of

00:38:54,619 --> 00:38:59,509
improving the UI and helping to

00:38:57,259 --> 00:39:04,249
translate the big sites with a lot of

00:38:59,509 --> 00:39:09,200
content as we usually deal with that

00:39:04,249 --> 00:39:12,559
type of customers and usually the

00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:15,470
companies that use smartphone with

00:39:12,559 --> 00:39:19,759
Drupal usually Drupal is only one source

00:39:15,470 --> 00:39:26,240
of content in their platform so usually

00:39:19,759 --> 00:39:29,259
it's something else and as we have such

00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:32,559
type of customers I think this is where

00:39:29,259 --> 00:39:38,180
you might expect our help and

00:39:32,559 --> 00:39:57,529
involvement in developing and key MGMT I

00:39:38,180 --> 00:40:00,079
think that that's yeah and I think

00:39:57,529 --> 00:40:04,579
another nice thing in the current

00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:07,549
situation is that right now or we before

00:40:04,579 --> 00:40:12,019
like the smarting connector in Drupal 7

00:40:07,549 --> 00:40:14,989
it was our custom solution that we only

00:40:12,019 --> 00:40:18,289
were responsible for four but right now

00:40:14,989 --> 00:40:22,819
if some of our customers for example one

00:40:18,289 --> 00:40:25,430
some in future we can ask them if it's

00:40:22,819 --> 00:40:28,549
appropriate maybe to spend some

00:40:25,430 --> 00:40:31,099
resources as now it's like not not only

00:40:28,549 --> 00:40:33,799
our custom solution but everyone can

00:40:31,099 --> 00:40:36,489
benefit from and if they they are

00:40:33,799 --> 00:40:39,200
willing to we can propose them to

00:40:36,489 --> 00:40:42,680
contribute to actual open source that

00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:45,589
others may benefit from not sure how

00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:49,549
well will it go as we are only at the

00:40:45,589 --> 00:40:51,999
start of our path here but that's at

00:40:49,549 --> 00:40:51,999
least an option

00:40:57,500 --> 00:41:09,080
anyone else 123 sold okay thank you

00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:09,080
