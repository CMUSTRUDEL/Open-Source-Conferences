Title: DrupalCon Dublin 2016: Confessions of a control freak: A guide to letting go
Publication date: 2016-09-27
Playlist: DrupalCon Dublin 2016
Description: 
	Project managers are inherently driven by a sense of responsibility for project success. They feel accountable for all aspects of planning, organisation and direction on a project. The fear that something will go wrong if they are not involved in everything, all of the time, can become overwhelming. They need things to be under control.

The problem for project managers is that this outlook can lead to them becoming controlling. In order to avoid any chance of failure, they end up ruling, rather than leading a project. They constantly look for ways to eliminate risk and ensure that work progresses according to the schedule. Their goal is to get the job done with a minimum of fuss.  

This approach works well for the project manager for whom delivering on time and budget are the only factors that allow them a restful night’s sleep. It’s not so great for achieving team satisfaction, fostering technical innovation, improving the user experience, or ultimately delivering a solution that provides real value to the client. The number crunchers will be happy, but everyone else will just be relieved that it’s all over.

Whilst easy to criticise, it’s sometimes hard for project managers to take a different approach. They are tasked with managing a complex interdependent system of people and technologies that behave unpredictably in a commercial environment that applies pressure to deliver quickly. It takes time for such a system to develop a strong dynamic, become self organised and distribute project leadership in a way that would allow them to act differently.

In the absence of these factors, a project manager is more inclined to exert control than to take a position of leadership where they influence and inspire others to contribute to the success of the project. It’s an unfortunate commercial reality that the time and budget pressures imposed upon many projects prevent teams from thriving and project managers from becoming leaders.

For many years, my own experience led me to be very much inclined towards project control. In the absence of adequate time, or a strong team dynamic, a controlling approach felt like the only way to achieve success. I eventually came to realise that projects weren’t particularly enjoyable experiences and no-one on the team finished them with any real sense of satisfaction or achievement.

The catalyst for change was undoubtedly my initial exposure to a more agile approach. Whilst far from a perfect project, it was immediately clear that more open and regular communication fostered a more healthy working relationship amongst team members. We more quickly gained a good team dynamic, and I felt far less inclined to make sure everything was under my control.

Having worked this way ever since, I have learned a great deal about relinquishing control and in the process how to achieve a much better outcome. I would like to share my experiences and use this session to outline a guide to achieving more balance, remaining calm under pressure, and focussing on the delivery of a higher value solution with a more engaged team.

In the session I will also discuss how to delegate responsibility, be more a more inclusive decision maker, and rationalise commercial pressures in order to filter out less reasonable requests. I will show when it’s still ok to exercise control in order to avoid chaos, and will discuss how to better manage your clients to build a stronger, more trusting relationship with them.

As the Client Service Director at PreviousNext I am in the fortunate position of working with a very capable and experienced team. We are all committed to a more collaborative approach on our projects and have built a very strong team dynamic. Our whole team contributes to the oversight of projects and are empowered to make key decisions about how we implement things. We’ve managed to develop a much more sustainable approach to project management that I will also share in this session.

	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,009
right we're good so here we are this

00:00:03,449 --> 00:00:07,010
this is a quote that I found that I

00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:09,360
think very nicely encapsulates what I

00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:13,170
the message I want to convey to you

00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:15,150
today so the one look at unicorn is also

00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:17,369
a really nice metaphor for the likely

00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:19,500
outcome of some projects especially

00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:24,869
those whose initial requirements are of

00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:28,500
the double rainbow variety so where do

00:00:24,869 --> 00:00:30,660
things go so wrong on our projects well

00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:33,390
most of our projects that we work on can

00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:35,640
be very technically complex but that's

00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:39,840
generally the thing that is of least

00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:41,700
concern it's more the raft of commercial

00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,620
pressures that we're subjected to and

00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:45,840
misguided requirements that we sometimes

00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:49,140
get from our clients and stakeholders

00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,309
that really trips us up on projects so

00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:52,800
if you combine this with the input

00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:54,539
that's also required from all the

00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,579
different people of varying skill sets

00:00:54,539 --> 00:01:01,800
that we have on our teams you've got the

00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:03,899
making of a very challenging project so

00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:06,090
how do you deal with such a challenging

00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:08,729
set of circumstances and deliver your

00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:11,850
project successfully well you think we'd

00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:15,060
know by now but clearly we don't a lot

00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:17,700
of projects don't go very well so as you

00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:21,450
can see from this study which has run

00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:24,060
for about 21 years and studied 50,000

00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:26,369
different software projects of all

00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:28,259
shapes and sizes you can see from the

00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:29,759
data that majority the projects are

00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:35,939
either challenged or they fail

00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:37,350
completely fail outright one thing I did

00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:40,220
want to mention up front today is that

00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:43,409
I'm not here to evangelize about agile

00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:44,880
agile projects have their own problems

00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:48,509
that you can see from the data in the

00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:51,720
previous study so a lot of them are

00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:53,340
still challenged and also fail but as

00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:57,649
you can see from this it's definitely

00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:57,649
worse for their waterfall counterparts

00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:06,619
so with the odds seemingly stacked

00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:09,209
against us as project managers what do

00:02:06,619 --> 00:02:11,730
the traditional projects project

00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:13,270
managers do as a formula for success on

00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:15,560
their projects

00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:19,880
well this is what a lot of them referred

00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:22,490
to so they do this and they stick to it

00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:24,380
by exerting control over all the factors

00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:26,870
they think need to be controlled on a

00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:28,760
project and might have an effect on

00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:34,100
their ability to complete the project on

00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:39,470
time and on budget and in line with the

00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:42,080
original specifications so this model of

00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:45,530
centralized control as we refer to it is

00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:47,390
really not a healthy approach and that's

00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:49,070
really what I wanted to talk about today

00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:50,900
and I really think this is one of the

00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:52,970
main contributing factors that leads to

00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:57,739
projects becoming very challenged as we

00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:59,360
saw before or actually failing so in

00:02:57,739 --> 00:03:01,190
order to explore this a little bit more

00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,410
detail we'll start by looking at the

00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:04,940
role of the project manager what things

00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:07,430
look like when they're too controlling

00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:09,230
discuss how they need to distribute this

00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:11,480
control a lot more broadly across the

00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:13,010
teams that they work with and in the

00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:17,269
process transition themselves from being

00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:19,280
a manager to more of a leader also

00:03:17,269 --> 00:03:21,470
outline their environmental factors at

00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,700
play and the sort of business structures

00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:25,790
that influence the behavior of the

00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:27,430
project manager and have a real bearing

00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:29,840
on how they relate to those around them

00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:33,250
we'll look at moving from more of a

00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:35,269
hierarchical model to a much flatter one

00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:37,010
will also look at the mindset of the

00:03:35,269 --> 00:03:39,830
project manager and how this really

00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:41,150
heavily influences the mindset of those

00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:43,730
around them and the teams that they work

00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:45,140
with want to highlight how they need to

00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:47,150
move away from a fixed mindset towards

00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:53,360
one that's much more open to learning

00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:55,310
and challenges and then finally finished

00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,200
by having a look at the culture that is

00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:59,180
an outcome of this sort of behavior and

00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,769
the varying levels of control that are

00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:03,410
exerted upon the projects that we work

00:04:00,769 --> 00:04:05,030
on and then look at seeing now we can

00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:08,090
move from seeing projects as a

00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:10,250
money-making process machine to them

00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:15,620
much more as a living organism that

00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:18,280
requires a lot of attention and care so

00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:21,890
the controlling printed project manager

00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:22,970
so who are these people well there's

00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:24,800
this one

00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:30,380
you can work that out that's picture of

00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:32,810
me so that's back in 2006 and what I'd

00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:37,430
probably consider the peak of my own

00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:40,040
benevolent dictatorship I'd recently

00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:42,050
completed a certification as a project

00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:43,700
management professional and it even got

00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:45,560
myself elected to the local board of the

00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:48,830
project management institute in Sydney

00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:51,920
so as a very proud project management

00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:53,090
practitioner and the same time proudly

00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:56,270
acknowledged that I was a control freak

00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:57,950
so I thought and honestly believed at

00:04:56,270 --> 00:05:02,660
the time that that was a really good

00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:04,010
quality to have as a project manager it

00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:05,620
also convinced herself that my

00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:07,850
competency as a project manager was

00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:10,010
definitely due to my attention to detail

00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:11,800
and my extensive knowledge of the

00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:14,030
standards that I just learned about and

00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:15,890
my ability to be in control of every

00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:18,110
situation on every project that I worked

00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:21,770
on so I was delivering projects on time

00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:23,419
and on budget mostly and as far as I

00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:27,650
concerned I was concerned everything was

00:05:23,419 --> 00:05:30,410
all good but it wasn't that great at all

00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:32,810
so it was actually very stressful and I

00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:34,520
realized that in order to achieve the

00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:36,680
sort of perceived successes that I was

00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:38,979
having on projects I had spent the

00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:43,040
majority of my time poring over

00:05:38,979 --> 00:05:44,900
documentation and plans making sure that

00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:49,580
everything I was doing was adhering to

00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:51,530
those regional plans um so I wasn't long

00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:54,260
after this that I had a bit of an

00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:55,700
awakening and rather than continue down

00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:57,890
this path of professional development

00:05:55,700 --> 00:06:00,650
that I've chosen and been undertaking

00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:03,140
for many years keeping to extolling the

00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:04,910
virtues of the different project

00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:06,710
management standards that I'd been

00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:08,360
become accustomed to and being

00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:11,930
indoctrinated into I really started to

00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:13,640
question the whole approach so I guess

00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:16,010
what I'd like to look at is well what

00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:18,530
changed well the one thing I did realize

00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:21,169
that the only reason that my projects

00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:22,669
were successful was I was actually very

00:06:21,169 --> 00:06:25,100
good at communicating with the people

00:06:22,669 --> 00:06:27,110
that I was working with and always made

00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:29,750
sure that clients knew where were up to

00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:31,039
and the team had all the information

00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:32,300
they needed keeping the flow of

00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:34,070
information going right throughout the

00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:35,639
project and all the parties on the

00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:37,319
project had

00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:40,889
as long as everybody was adhering to the

00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:43,439
plans and specs it was great so the

00:06:40,889 --> 00:06:46,919
thing was though what I realized what

00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:48,300
was still all about me and working on

00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:51,270
these projects really wasn't that much

00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:53,400
fun so we're certainly all very well

00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:56,120
intentioned my intentions for the

00:06:53,400 --> 00:07:00,210
interest of the project were were right

00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:01,889
but as I alluded to a lot earlier it was

00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:03,870
it was still very much a benevolent

00:07:01,889 --> 00:07:07,319
dictatorship so ultimately every project

00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:08,879
was was an ego-driven exercise that was

00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:10,889
used to inflate the importance of my own

00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:13,050
role on the project and I strongly

00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:14,430
believe that in the absence in my

00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:16,439
absence on the project that the whole

00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:20,250
thing would collapse so and that was

00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:24,990
probably right but realistically i'd set

00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:27,060
it up that way so i always also

00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:29,550
obsessively looked for ways to improve

00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:31,439
the process on the projects and make

00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:34,770
everything much more predictable and

00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:36,210
repeatable I mean the question I asked

00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:39,389
myself was how hard could it be to build

00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:41,189
a website and it was basically the same

00:07:39,389 --> 00:07:43,289
process every time we work out a content

00:07:41,189 --> 00:07:44,819
structure we do some designs we add the

00:07:43,289 --> 00:07:46,349
content build a few pages and then we

00:07:44,819 --> 00:07:50,339
launched it really didn't need to be

00:07:46,349 --> 00:07:53,279
that hard um so that might have been

00:07:50,339 --> 00:07:55,710
true say ten years ago when I was

00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:58,740
originally in this kind of mindset and

00:07:55,710 --> 00:08:00,419
to some respect for to some respects

00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:03,240
it's still true today on some projects

00:08:00,419 --> 00:08:04,860
but these were marketing driven websites

00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:06,960
but they are rapidly involving into very

00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:08,430
functionally rich web applications

00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,930
content management systems were getting

00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:13,289
much more sophisticated in order to

00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:14,639
support them and the requirements on

00:08:13,289 --> 00:08:18,360
projects were becoming a lot more

00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:20,699
bespoke so it took along took a bit time

00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:21,990
to realize it but ultimately we entered

00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:27,599
into the realm of what was product

00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:29,069
development so I guess at some point

00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:31,289
here I'd reached a bit of a tipping

00:08:29,069 --> 00:08:34,169
point and knew that I've had to make a

00:08:31,289 --> 00:08:37,169
change didn't really know what that

00:08:34,169 --> 00:08:38,969
change should be but I came up with a

00:08:37,169 --> 00:08:44,029
very brilliant strategy to deal with it

00:08:38,969 --> 00:08:45,690
and that was not a quit my job so

00:08:44,029 --> 00:08:48,630
fortunately I've been tinkering around

00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:49,440
on the side for a little while actually

00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:51,450
building of all things

00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:54,210
my own proprietary content management

00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:55,680
system because of course at the time

00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:59,430
that's exactly what the world needed was

00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:01,110
another CMS um but realistically a lot

00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:05,550
of them were complete rubbish and no

00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:08,070
very extensive or both and it turned out

00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:11,940
to be a reasonably good idea and kept me

00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:13,740
gainfully employed for a few years so

00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:16,770
during this time I got a lot of exposure

00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:19,050
to to product development so I really

00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:20,820
became I really came to appreciate the

00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:22,530
iterative nature of producing something

00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:24,600
that evolves over time and something

00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:26,450
that you really spend rather than

00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:28,470
spending an inordinate amount of time

00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:32,010
specking things out right from the start

00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:35,760
you you work very iterative Lee through

00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:37,890
the product development cycle and I got

00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:39,510
to look at this through the sort of the

00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:40,800
eyes of project management and the

00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:45,000
experience that I've had for too many

00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:48,120
years so fast 40 few years and multiple

00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,940
scrum water scrum fall whatever

00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:52,140
iteration of various project management

00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:56,310
methodology you want to look at and

00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:58,500
other agile approaches um what have I

00:09:56,310 --> 00:10:00,570
learned well I know for sure that it's

00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:02,280
not focusing on the proper on the

00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:04,800
process that makes projects is

00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:06,120
successful or enjoyable as much more

00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:09,390
about focusing on the people that you're

00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:11,100
working with so making compromises and

00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:13,920
sharing the experience together whether

00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:15,270
it's good bad or indifferent so it's a

00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,130
little like going traveling together and

00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:20,000
working out your itinerary as you as you

00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:23,070
go as opposed to being the board guide

00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:25,740
board to a guy just letting a bunch of

00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:27,480
uninterested tourists around on the same

00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:29,240
to a day after day you know maybe you

00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:32,730
booked a couple of nights to start with

00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:34,860
just to be safe and but then you work

00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:36,920
together and base your plans on a

00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:39,270
general idea of where you're going and

00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:40,800
generally those experiences that you

00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:42,839
have like a travel experiences are much

00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,010
more engaging and much more interesting

00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:48,810
by the time we get to the end of it

00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:51,180
everybody's got a lot more out of it so

00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:52,680
in this context I still see the role of

00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:54,900
the project manager is a person who's

00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:57,930
done a bit of traveling around this area

00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:58,830
that you're in they they know where

00:10:57,930 --> 00:11:01,020
they're going they know what they're

00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:02,279
doing and and they're like the idea is

00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:03,990
that they help the group now

00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:08,029
their way around you need to be much

00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:08,029
more of a tour leader than a tour guide

00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:13,259
so your role is also to help solve the

00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:15,600
problems along the way you don't

00:11:13,259 --> 00:11:17,670
necessarily have to be the one who has

00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,860
all the answers but you definitely step

00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:22,470
in whether it's a problem and you're the

00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:27,029
one who facilitates a way to solve this

00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:29,069
problem you also want the group to get

00:11:27,029 --> 00:11:30,720
along with each other of course so

00:11:29,069 --> 00:11:32,790
you're all about ensuring that the

00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,019
relationships are built between the team

00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:36,059
and the David very and that they're

00:11:34,019 --> 00:11:38,519
healthy you want people to to share

00:11:36,059 --> 00:11:41,220
ideas and develop a common language that

00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:42,660
will ultimately benefit the outcome you

00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:46,920
just don't you don't want to be just an

00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:48,180
interpreter on a project you also want

00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:50,910
to encourage people who can contribute

00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:52,949
their ideas and challenge the decisions

00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:55,589
that have been made you don't want the

00:11:52,949 --> 00:11:57,240
team to be just a bunch of followers and

00:11:55,589 --> 00:11:59,970
go along with a set plan it should be

00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:01,110
everyone's right to contribute and be

00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:06,269
heard along the way if they have

00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:07,970
something go ahead so most of all you

00:12:06,269 --> 00:12:09,899
want people to feel empowered and

00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:11,220
contribute beyond their role in the

00:12:09,899 --> 00:12:12,300
group so you really want to create an

00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:14,420
environment where people are willing to

00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:16,740
volunteer and take on roles and tasks

00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:19,379
that really streamline the progress the

00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:20,939
project rather than relying on making

00:12:19,379 --> 00:12:24,920
relying on you to make something happen

00:12:20,939 --> 00:12:24,920
or pass along the relevant information

00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:30,240
so I guess the question is why do you

00:12:29,069 --> 00:12:32,490
bother with all of this and why don't

00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:35,550
you just stick to the the idea of Gantt

00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:37,110
charts and specifications well I I

00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:39,600
strongly believe that it's actually it

00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:41,610
can be quite rewarding to take this

00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:44,129
approach and I've certainly got a much

00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:45,629
more meaningful relationship with the

00:12:44,129 --> 00:12:47,610
people that I work with and the

00:12:45,629 --> 00:12:50,759
relationship with the clients that I

00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:53,759
work with as well and so I think it

00:12:50,759 --> 00:12:56,399
really is a great approach and a much

00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:57,720
more inclusive approach probably one of

00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:01,170
the best examples that I have recently

00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:03,689
in the last few years at previousnext

00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:06,689
where I'm at now is that we started

00:13:03,689 --> 00:13:10,170
setting up a teams based model a few

00:13:06,689 --> 00:13:12,059
years ago and we wanted to move much

00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:14,209
more to this collaborative kind of

00:13:12,059 --> 00:13:15,990
working environment with each other and

00:13:14,209 --> 00:13:18,600
one of the first things we

00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:21,990
we did was trying to identify technical

00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:23,670
leads within the teams and we talked to

00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:25,020
some of our more senior developers we

00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:27,540
said you know we want you to take on

00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:29,399
this role and we want you to start you

00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:30,690
know taking a bit of a lead on on the

00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:32,100
projects and working through the

00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:33,870
requirements and working with the rest

00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:37,740
of the team on developing the solution

00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:39,480
and the response that we got on a couple

00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:41,520
of occasions but one person I remember

00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:42,570
in particular was that they they said to

00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:45,529
me I don't wanna be a project manager

00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:47,940
and that was that they didn't quite

00:13:45,529 --> 00:13:49,200
comprehend the idea what the team lead

00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:52,529
was about and what we were trying to do

00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:54,300
so ultimately what we did was just kind

00:13:52,529 --> 00:13:56,880
of back off we would push down that path

00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:58,920
of still creating a teams based model

00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,420
but we just sort of let it ride for a

00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:01,649
little bit into them adopted some of

00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:05,930
these approaches that I was talking

00:14:01,649 --> 00:14:09,200
about and what's happened over time is

00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:11,940
rather than sort of force this idea on

00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:13,320
to these people who were uncomfortable

00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:14,610
with it in the first place and thinking

00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:16,620
that it was actually taking on the role

00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:18,060
of a project manager so they've come to

00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:21,450
realize that that's not what it was at

00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:23,610
all and in the last couple of years

00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:28,200
we've seen a lot of our senior

00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:30,149
developers really step up and take on

00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:31,829
and actually take on discrete projects

00:14:30,149 --> 00:14:35,220
at their own literally to the point

00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:36,839
where I barely have any contact with the

00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:39,360
client throughout the course of the

00:14:36,839 --> 00:14:41,250
project so that's a really good thing

00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:43,290
it's been great for the projects it's

00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:45,690
been really good for the team and it's

00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:51,570
been at we get some really good outcomes

00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:55,410
for the clients as well so what sort of

00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:57,510
environment creates this sort of

00:14:55,410 --> 00:15:02,430
controlling behavior with project

00:14:57,510 --> 00:15:04,770
managers so the standard kind of

00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:07,529
operating model for businesses is one

00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:09,570
that's fairly hierarchical and berry

00:15:07,529 --> 00:15:11,959
management driven so any project manager

00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:15,029
who is operating in this environment

00:15:11,959 --> 00:15:17,209
plays a really big part in influencing

00:15:15,029 --> 00:15:20,310
the way that you approach your projects

00:15:17,209 --> 00:15:25,650
so some client organizations that you

00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:27,540
work with have a very similar effect any

00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:29,520
influence and on the way that the

00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:31,710
project manager can operate they

00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:34,320
might be operating in the sort of way

00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:37,710
that I'm trying to describe today but

00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:39,660
they're imposing a very traditional or

00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:40,860
hierarchical model on the project and

00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:46,140
the project manager which makes it very

00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:47,550
difficult for them so while the client

00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:51,150
might be very engaged in the whole

00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:53,010
project they're very camp very heavily

00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:54,780
influenced by the management forces at

00:15:53,010 --> 00:16:01,500
play and the model that they have to

00:15:54,780 --> 00:16:05,130
work within so one of the other very big

00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:07,410
things that we find is a huge problem in

00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:08,820
trying to be a lot more flexible and I

00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:10,620
guess a lot more agile and this project

00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:12,900
is the procure procurement process that

00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:14,730
we have to go through with our clients

00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:19,530
so they're asking is for a very

00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:23,310
prescriptive response to a very very

00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:26,310
specific set of requirements and a lot

00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:27,570
of their proposals are like this double

00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:29,760
rainbow vision that I was talking about

00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:31,500
before and then they put in place a

00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:32,880
contract that dictates the terms that

00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,750
you have to work within and you have to

00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,240
try and stick to all of these

00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:38,130
specifications that are in place if you

00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:41,010
don't tackle that right up the front of

00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:42,300
the project that just has this role in

00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:45,510
effect right through the rest of the

00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:53,520
project and and becomes a an instrument

00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:55,680
of control throughout the project so I'm

00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:57,000
not suggesting that any of these project

00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,680
managers on either side of the equation

00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,920
with the clients or in our Tamra

00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:03,090
inherently bad people they're all trying

00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,920
to undertake these things with the right

00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:08,010
intentions at the start of the project

00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:09,660
but they do end up much more so they

00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:12,089
tend towards a much more controlling

00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:13,530
type of behavior in order to appease the

00:17:12,089 --> 00:17:16,380
wheel of this organization that they're

00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:21,870
working for in a very hierarchical and

00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:24,240
traditional structure so one thing that

00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:25,830
we also find now is that like I

00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,690
mentioned before we're dealing with

00:17:25,830 --> 00:17:29,370
client organizations who still work

00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:31,080
within this very traditional model where

00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:33,120
we're trying to be a lot more agile and

00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:35,370
a lot less controlling in the way that

00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:38,610
we're approaching our projects and then

00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:40,620
we end up with this clash of clash of

00:17:38,610 --> 00:17:41,539
cultures essentially classic clash of

00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:45,470
environments

00:17:41,539 --> 00:17:48,109
and working together so what what tends

00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:51,679
to happen is that we try and coach the

00:17:48,109 --> 00:17:53,269
client through or we set up the

00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:54,979
structure at the beginning that's kind

00:17:53,269 --> 00:17:57,379
of less hierarchical and we try and take

00:17:54,979 --> 00:18:01,159
the project team into a much flatter

00:17:57,379 --> 00:18:02,960
kind of structure but it really seems to

00:18:01,159 --> 00:18:04,279
influence a lot of the behavior right

00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,679
throughout the project and we and we

00:18:04,279 --> 00:18:08,840
find that by the end of the project we

00:18:06,679 --> 00:18:12,080
still have a lot of people who are very

00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:14,210
weary and very over it kind of the same

00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:16,789
sort of experience that I had years ago

00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:20,330
when when we were running projects based

00:18:16,789 --> 00:18:22,549
on Gantt charts and specifications what

00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:25,389
we have found though again is if you

00:18:22,549 --> 00:18:27,799
really take some small steps and try to

00:18:25,389 --> 00:18:30,619
introduce some of these ideas into the

00:18:27,799 --> 00:18:32,509
project and to the client and sell them

00:18:30,619 --> 00:18:34,159
in on the benefits of being less kind of

00:18:32,509 --> 00:18:36,289
hierarchical and controlling about the

00:18:34,159 --> 00:18:37,489
the projects that by the end of the

00:18:36,289 --> 00:18:41,359
project they definitely have learnt

00:18:37,489 --> 00:18:43,639
things and a very recent project that we

00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:47,389
did was exactly like this where we'd set

00:18:43,639 --> 00:18:49,429
up a well they had set up a very strict

00:18:47,389 --> 00:18:51,169
contract and a very defined set of

00:18:49,429 --> 00:18:53,059
requirements we tried to introduce an

00:18:51,169 --> 00:18:54,320
agile methodology into the project and

00:18:53,059 --> 00:18:56,239
coach them through everybody was very

00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:59,269
enthusiastic about it at the beginning

00:18:56,239 --> 00:19:02,059
but as we went through the project these

00:18:59,269 --> 00:19:06,049
you know management forces I was talking

00:19:02,059 --> 00:19:08,509
about before just kept okay I guess

00:19:06,049 --> 00:19:11,509
eating away at the model that we were

00:19:08,509 --> 00:19:13,700
trying to build and constantly using

00:19:11,509 --> 00:19:16,999
things like the contract as a as a

00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:19,909
weapon to try and you know keep us on

00:19:16,999 --> 00:19:21,950
track suffice to say we did get to the

00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:24,229
end of the project we delivered on time

00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:26,989
and reasonably within budget but

00:19:24,229 --> 00:19:29,149
everyone on our team was was completely

00:19:26,989 --> 00:19:31,879
over it and the client was over it as

00:19:29,149 --> 00:19:33,619
well so we did learn things that was

00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:35,179
worth investing the time that we did in

00:19:33,619 --> 00:19:37,119
trying to get people a little bit more

00:19:35,179 --> 00:19:40,009
on board with the the ideas that we had

00:19:37,119 --> 00:19:45,919
but it was still pretty excruciating by

00:19:40,009 --> 00:19:49,879
the end of it so what is a more ideal

00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:51,379
model um well one obviously with the

00:19:49,879 --> 00:19:52,730
video share responsibility across the

00:19:51,379 --> 00:19:54,809
team it's not just about the project

00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:56,249
manager they're not the one

00:19:54,809 --> 00:19:58,110
who has to shoulder all the

00:19:56,249 --> 00:20:01,080
responsibilities develop to do a little

00:19:58,110 --> 00:20:03,240
bit deliver the project and it's

00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:05,039
something I guess you could refer to as

00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:06,360
a much flatter structure it's not the

00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:11,879
hierarchical model I was talking about

00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:13,679
before you also want to create a bit of

00:20:11,879 --> 00:20:15,960
a shared vision the project I was

00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:18,210
talking about before you know we were

00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:19,470
trying to establish a shared vision we

00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:21,659
do this a lot with a lot of our clients

00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:23,009
even while working with you know fairly

00:20:21,659 --> 00:20:24,870
prescriptive requirements and

00:20:23,009 --> 00:20:28,740
specifications we want to try and take

00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:30,629
it a little bit of a step back to almost

00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:32,190
before what the procurement process was

00:20:30,629 --> 00:20:33,570
to talk to them about what it is that

00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:34,919
they're really trying to achieve and

00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:36,749
then showing them a lot of their

00:20:34,919 --> 00:20:39,059
requirements you know probably don't

00:20:36,749 --> 00:20:41,429
really share or don't really relate to

00:20:39,059 --> 00:20:43,139
this idea of a shared vision so if you

00:20:41,429 --> 00:20:45,110
can move much of you obviously if you

00:20:43,139 --> 00:20:47,909
can start that way it's a much healthier

00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:49,379
place to be and not working to this

00:20:47,909 --> 00:20:52,499
predetermined set of requirements and

00:20:49,379 --> 00:20:53,759
specifications and then that way you've

00:20:52,499 --> 00:20:56,490
got the shared vision that you can kind

00:20:53,759 --> 00:20:59,249
of use as a as a real anchor point right

00:20:56,490 --> 00:21:01,259
throughout the project and at any point

00:20:59,249 --> 00:21:02,850
that people start questioning the

00:21:01,259 --> 00:21:05,070
approach will try and referring back to

00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:07,320
the some kind of specifications the

00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:09,210
beginning you can use this idea of

00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:15,779
shared vision to to talk that through

00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:18,240
and come up with a better approach the

00:21:15,779 --> 00:21:21,990
better approach is something that I kind

00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:24,990
of see as as common sense really looking

00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:26,519
back at the approaches that we were

00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:28,080
taking years ago around using Gantt

00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:30,389
charts and of course people still use

00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,799
today and specifications it doesn't

00:21:30,389 --> 00:21:33,869
really make a lot of sense because

00:21:31,799 --> 00:21:36,690
there's always a lot of change on

00:21:33,869 --> 00:21:39,509
projects every project you ever do never

00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:41,460
meets the exact specifications at the

00:21:39,509 --> 00:21:44,399
beginning you create this environment

00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:46,139
where you're actually building things

00:21:44,399 --> 00:21:50,279
that people don't want or they're not

00:21:46,139 --> 00:21:53,669
likely to use so if if you take that on

00:21:50,279 --> 00:21:58,190
board and use common sense really a lot

00:21:53,669 --> 00:21:58,190
of this really starts to fall into place

00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:09,130
so starting the project as a discovery

00:22:04,519 --> 00:22:11,299
led exercise rather than a specification

00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:14,090
exercise where you spend an inordinate

00:22:11,299 --> 00:22:16,850
amount of time drawing up designs and

00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:18,080
creating huge documents that you use as

00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:21,590
the reference point throughout the

00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:26,210
project you actually you start the

00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:30,320
project you agree to a budget you agree

00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:31,700
to a general set of or you agree to your

00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:33,740
shared vision and a general instead of

00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:36,470
high-level requirements and then you go

00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:38,120
into this phase of discovery where you

00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:39,529
work together with the client you work

00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:40,909
together with the team to really flush

00:22:39,529 --> 00:22:42,799
it out I mean this is obviously a very

00:22:40,909 --> 00:22:44,269
agile type approach building up a

00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:47,510
backlog of work that you're going to

00:22:44,269 --> 00:22:49,340
work on but you're not doing things or

00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:50,120
you're not trying to make a set of

00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:54,620
requirements that are highly

00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:57,919
prescriptive so once some of these ideas

00:22:54,620 --> 00:23:00,649
start coming out you can actually start

00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:02,600
building and prototyping them so in the

00:23:00,649 --> 00:23:04,460
time that you would be spending building

00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:06,679
these huge or writing these huge

00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:10,059
specification documents you can actually

00:23:06,679 --> 00:23:13,039
be working on the solution itself and

00:23:10,059 --> 00:23:15,980
part of the discovery process can be

00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:17,419
this idea of prototyping and just

00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:21,320
actually getting in there and starting

00:23:17,419 --> 00:23:28,070
to build creating something putting some

00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:32,000
of your ideas into practice and on the

00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:36,200
design front obviously back in the day

00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:40,210
the approach was to create a set of

00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:43,340
photoshopped designs that were then

00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:46,850
pixel perfect or the execution was meant

00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:48,110
to be pixel perfect and again like a lot

00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:50,450
of functional requirements what you end

00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:53,480
up with is nothing like the original

00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:56,659
design that you that you were given so

00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:59,389
again our approach is to be a lot more

00:23:56,659 --> 00:24:02,029
iterative about the design process and

00:23:59,389 --> 00:24:06,970
starting with a kind of a master design

00:24:02,029 --> 00:24:09,950
approach and working from there and

00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:12,169
ultimately what you want to try and do

00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:14,210
is as I'm sure many

00:24:12,169 --> 00:24:16,190
of you are familiar with is this idea of

00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:18,200
continuous delivery so rather than this

00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:20,179
start and end to a project what you

00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:21,980
really want to be looking at is this

00:24:20,179 --> 00:24:24,200
idea that you're going to be working

00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:26,389
together on this solution or this

00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:27,919
platform for quite a period of time and

00:24:26,389 --> 00:24:31,070
it's going to evolve and you want to try

00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:33,679
and get get it launched as quickly as

00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:35,269
possible with the most high priority

00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:36,769
requirements you've got but then you are

00:24:35,269 --> 00:24:42,230
going to keep delivering and keep

00:24:36,769 --> 00:24:44,749
working on this solution together so

00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:46,039
that that kind of paints a bit of a

00:24:44,749 --> 00:24:48,470
picture about the sort of environment

00:24:46,039 --> 00:24:50,989
that we don't want to be working in and

00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:55,820
the sort of environment that we kind of

00:24:50,989 --> 00:25:01,309
aspire to now so the next concept I want

00:24:55,820 --> 00:25:02,929
to cover off is the idea of mindset so I

00:25:01,309 --> 00:25:05,690
touched a little bit on it earlier about

00:25:02,929 --> 00:25:07,730
what the mindset years of the project

00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:08,840
manager and how the environmental

00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:10,820
factors around them have a great

00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:13,279
influence on their role and what part

00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:15,739
they play in influencing the mindset of

00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:17,899
the team and the influence that a

00:25:15,739 --> 00:25:20,600
project manager can have whether they be

00:25:17,899 --> 00:25:23,149
a controlling type project manager or a

00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:24,919
much more open and collaborative project

00:25:23,149 --> 00:25:26,389
manager the influence they have on all

00:25:24,919 --> 00:25:27,830
the people around them and the mindset

00:25:26,389 --> 00:25:30,529
of the team around them and the clients

00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:33,169
that they work with can be huge I think

00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:36,019
it's a huge amount of influence that

00:25:33,169 --> 00:25:37,369
they have um so obviously what they do

00:25:36,019 --> 00:25:39,249
at the start of the project is very

00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:41,720
important that really sets the scene for

00:25:39,249 --> 00:25:43,639
what happens throughout the project as

00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:45,789
much as the sort of things that go on

00:25:43,639 --> 00:25:48,950
through the procurement process of

00:25:45,789 --> 00:25:51,499
projects the way that you set things up

00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:54,230
generally has a very long lasting effect

00:25:51,499 --> 00:25:55,460
right through the project and even can

00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:56,600
have an effect years later on the

00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:59,529
relationship that you have with the

00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:59,529
clients that you're working with

00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:07,560
so effectively there's two types of

00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:09,720
mindset and I think these relate quite

00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:11,730
nicely to the sort of mindset that you

00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:12,960
get when you have a project manager who

00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:14,910
is a bit of a control freak and a

00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:18,060
project manager who is a lot more open

00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:20,540
and collaborative so there's two types

00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:23,490
of these two types of mind steps can be

00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:26,580
referred to as fixed mindset or a growth

00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:29,150
mindset and like the levels of control

00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:32,850
that you are exerted on a project

00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:35,490
there's there's different levels across

00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:37,020
the spectrum of of mindset but the

00:26:35,490 --> 00:26:38,610
general theory is that you're either one

00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:41,210
you tend towards one or the other

00:26:38,610 --> 00:26:44,040
doesn't mean that you can't move between

00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:49,800
between the two or learn to be a more

00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:51,690
growth oriented sort of person so um a

00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:55,260
controlling project manager obviously

00:26:51,690 --> 00:26:57,900
has a very fixed mindset they they do

00:26:55,260 --> 00:27:00,210
feel very empowered and feel that they

00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:02,160
know best and that you know managing

00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:03,150
projects is their thing and they're kind

00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:06,660
of the smartest person in the room

00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:07,980
around how projects should run they

00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:10,170
already know how everything should go

00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:11,970
because they've got a very detailed

00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:13,980
Gantt chart they've got a huge set of

00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:16,380
specifications they've got this document

00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:18,630
to work from they already know how it's

00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:20,910
all going to go and then they set course

00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:22,370
accordingly so it ultimately becomes

00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:24,480
kind of their way or the highway and

00:27:22,370 --> 00:27:27,090
they feel like they've already know all

00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:29,430
the answers so if things go beyond their

00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:30,990
current knowledge or things become too

00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:36,120
challenging on the project they tend to

00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:40,040
get very stressed so a project manager

00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:42,450
that's much more open to challenges and

00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:45,240
learn new ways of approaching things as

00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:46,860
they go through and as problems and

00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:49,110
challenges come up through the project

00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:50,670
is likely likely to be far less

00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:52,860
controlling and helped foster a much

00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:55,100
more positive mindset right across the

00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:55,100
team

00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:03,320
so what are the sort of things that

00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:07,610
actually define the mindset well was

00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:09,350
preparing my talk I identified a list of

00:28:07,610 --> 00:28:12,800
keywords that I thought were relevant to

00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:16,040
the content that I was preparing for my

00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:18,920
talk and I group them is what I consider

00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:21,230
good or bad depending on how they

00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:23,600
related to this concept of control on a

00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:25,220
project for most of them that are

00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,750
actually pretty easy to group it was

00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:29,600
pretty straightforward as to whether it

00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:33,850
was a bad concept or a good concept and

00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:36,560
a few of them stood out though and I

00:28:33,850 --> 00:28:38,000
found well I looked at them in in a very

00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:40,790
unscientific way I thought this is a

00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,500
really good way to kind of define what

00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:44,750
someone's mind city is by looking at

00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:48,590
these words or these keywords that have

00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:54,560
come up and understanding how they would

00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:57,140
interpret them so this is a set of bad

00:28:54,560 --> 00:29:01,040
keywords that I came up with and what

00:28:57,140 --> 00:29:04,520
I've highlighted here is a number of the

00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:05,780
good and bad activities the practices

00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:07,100
the approaches and the behaviors

00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:10,490
associated with the different types of

00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:12,590
working environments of centralized

00:29:10,490 --> 00:29:15,080
control versus are much more distributed

00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:17,720
control type model and you can see here

00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:19,460
from the words that are highlighted

00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:22,010
these are the ones that I felt really

00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:24,110
stood out and would be a really good

00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:27,680
test to put in front of somebody to say

00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:29,830
what does this mean to you in context of

00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:33,620
project management so you can see

00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:37,250
something as simple as you know mistakes

00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:42,610
or failure are they are good or are they

00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:48,170
a bad thing so on a more positive note

00:29:42,610 --> 00:29:49,430
this is a the the better approach and

00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:51,650
the sort of activities in the

00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:55,580
description of an environment that's a

00:29:51,650 --> 00:29:56,810
much more much more much less controlled

00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:58,820
and much more collaborative type of

00:29:56,810 --> 00:30:00,350
environment and again these ideas of

00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:01,670
these keywords and the way that you look

00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:04,760
at failure or the way you look at

00:30:01,670 --> 00:30:07,480
mistakes really determines what what

00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:07,480
your mindset is

00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:24,110
yeah shorter so again it's a very

00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:27,050
unscientific conclusion that have come

00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:29,480
to but using something like this is a

00:30:27,050 --> 00:30:31,010
tool to question your own mindset

00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:33,350
question the mindset of the project

00:30:31,010 --> 00:30:35,540
managers that work with all the projects

00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:37,670
that you're working on can be really

00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:39,400
useful exercise to identify some of the

00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:41,780
areas where you want to try and

00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:43,490
encourage some change or move a little

00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:51,530
bit more towards this less controlling

00:30:43,490 --> 00:30:56,020
kind of behavior so the last thing I

00:30:51,530 --> 00:31:00,620
want to look at is is culture and

00:30:56,020 --> 00:31:02,060
culture is really an outcome of the

00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:04,550
three other things that we've looked at

00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:06,260
so the project manager themselves the

00:31:04,550 --> 00:31:09,920
environment that they're operating in

00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:11,810
and the mindset that develops as a

00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:13,790
result of their own mindset and the

00:31:11,810 --> 00:31:16,610
mindset of the team I think combining

00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:24,110
all those things together you end up

00:31:16,610 --> 00:31:27,110
with a certain culture so the less

00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:29,990
desirable culture is something I

00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:34,850
mentioned before and that is this idea

00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:36,980
of projects or businesses or both being

00:31:34,850 --> 00:31:43,940
just some kind of money-making process

00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:46,360
machine and what you have in this sort

00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:48,920
of environment is two types of people

00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:50,540
you have the people who are in control

00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:52,280
and then the people who are working for

00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:55,460
them so this idea of controllers and

00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:56,840
pleases and you know there's there's

00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:59,210
nothing particularly healthy about that

00:31:56,840 --> 00:32:00,680
type of model there's only one side of

00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:03,110
the equation there that really gets

00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:05,540
anything out of it but as I you know

00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:06,890
alluded to before even when you are in

00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:09,460
that controlling mindset isn't really

00:32:06,890 --> 00:32:09,460
not much fun

00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:17,110
the sort of relationship that you end up

00:32:13,870 --> 00:32:20,770
having as a project manager with your

00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:23,080
team developers designers is much more

00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:28,300
like a parent-child type of relationship

00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:30,640
and back ten years ago when I was much

00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:33,340
more in that kind of control freak

00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:36,850
mindset and had actually recently just

00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:39,460
had kids I felt that the couple of years

00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:42,790
of experience that I had as a parent was

00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:44,680
was some fantastic skill that I had now

00:32:42,790 --> 00:32:46,330
acquired that allowed me to be a better

00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:47,740
project manager because this is

00:32:46,330 --> 00:32:49,570
essentially the relationship that you

00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:52,920
ended up having with the people around

00:32:49,570 --> 00:32:56,470
you it felt like you were managing a

00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:58,360
bunch of kids but realistically what I

00:32:56,470 --> 00:33:00,700
realized now is that that was more about

00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:02,830
my mindset than the people I was working

00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:09,840
with it admittedly some of them pretty

00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:11,920
challenging um so this idea of failure

00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:13,630
looking at those key words before the

00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:16,050
way that you interpret failure says a

00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:19,480
lot about the mindset of the project and

00:33:16,050 --> 00:33:22,860
the mindset of the project manager so

00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:26,440
the idea that failure is not acceptable

00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:28,450
is is a very strong indication that

00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:30,510
you're not really in the right frame of

00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:35,230
mind and you're not really in a very

00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:37,180
healthy working environment it's like

00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:38,980
it's okay to fail as long as you you

00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:41,710
learn from that and and you fix the

00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:44,500
problems but when when failure does

00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:46,120
occur or people make mistakes this is

00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:49,120
what happens it's very bland driven it's

00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:52,510
like who who made a mistake what whose

00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:55,650
fault is this and you try and isolate

00:33:52,510 --> 00:34:01,030
the problem rather than just moving on

00:33:55,650 --> 00:34:05,500
and the working environment in which

00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:08,520
you're in is riddled with this it's full

00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:10,540
of anxiety and pressure to deliver

00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:12,700
according to the schedule or within the

00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:16,680
budget or based on the specifications

00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:16,680
that you you've had laid out

00:34:17,339 --> 00:34:22,450
so this is something I kind of occurred

00:34:20,530 --> 00:34:25,750
to me some time ago and the way that I

00:34:22,450 --> 00:34:27,399
would describe how these projects go and

00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:28,750
what this environment is like what a

00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:31,480
project is like within this environment

00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:34,960
and you may or may not have heard of it

00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:36,250
it's pretty common in in movies and

00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:37,960
theater this idea of a three-act

00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:40,569
structure and it kind of really nicely

00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:42,190
describes what a project looks like when

00:34:40,569 --> 00:34:44,290
you're in this very controlling type

00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:46,059
environment so the three-act structure

00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:49,569
if you don't know it is there's the

00:34:46,059 --> 00:34:51,429
setup then the second act is the

00:34:49,569 --> 00:34:53,740
confrontation and then the final act is

00:34:51,429 --> 00:34:55,839
the resolution and that seems to feel

00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:57,579
very much like a lot of projects that

00:34:55,839 --> 00:35:00,760
I've ever worked on or that I've been

00:34:57,579 --> 00:35:03,640
aware of is that you spend most of your

00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:05,319
time in the second act in this period of

00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:07,510
confrontation and working through all

00:35:05,319 --> 00:35:08,950
the things that should have been

00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:11,800
delivered or according to the

00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:14,290
specification and then finally to get it

00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:17,230
across the line at the end you move into

00:35:14,290 --> 00:35:18,700
this phase of resolution and everyone

00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:20,230
sort of agrees and says yep all right

00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:26,640
well that will do let's just all get out

00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:29,680
of here because we're totally over it so

00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:33,609
looking at what sort of culture that we

00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:36,520
really want to have we need to we need

00:35:33,609 --> 00:35:39,730
to appreciate that what we're working

00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:43,030
within is is a living organism project

00:35:39,730 --> 00:35:45,099
team is a lot of people they all have

00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:47,290
very different personalities the whole

00:35:45,099 --> 00:35:49,569
project itself is really just a big

00:35:47,290 --> 00:35:51,430
living breathing organism it's not just

00:35:49,569 --> 00:35:56,349
this machine that keeps cranking out

00:35:51,430 --> 00:35:58,450
projects for profit so we want to move

00:35:56,349 --> 00:36:04,240
the culture much more towards this idea

00:35:58,450 --> 00:36:07,859
of a learning focus leaving organism so

00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:11,950
rather than this idea of controllers and

00:36:07,859 --> 00:36:13,839
pleases what we want is a set of

00:36:11,950 --> 00:36:15,869
co-drivers and navigators so as a

00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:18,400
project manager you want to have

00:36:15,869 --> 00:36:20,109
co-drivers and you want navigators with

00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:22,059
you you don't want to be the one driving

00:36:20,109 --> 00:36:25,299
the car the whole time and everybody

00:36:22,059 --> 00:36:27,280
else just following your lead it reduces

00:36:25,299 --> 00:36:29,740
the stress on you as a project manager

00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:30,260
incredibly to get people on board and to

00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:32,450
get

00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:35,120
people helping you deliver the project

00:36:32,450 --> 00:36:37,610
essentially so back to that example I

00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:39,650
gave before now that we've moved a lot

00:36:37,610 --> 00:36:41,990
more into this culture of having people

00:36:39,650 --> 00:36:44,960
step up and do what they originally

00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:48,320
thought was project management takes a

00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:50,440
huge burden off us as project managers

00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:55,370
to deliver the project itself and

00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:57,980
ultimately everyone is is responsible

00:36:55,370 --> 00:37:03,380
for getting to the getting to the end of

00:36:57,980 --> 00:37:06,950
the journey the relationships are there

00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:09,470
much more adult so this idea of a

00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:11,720
parent-child relationship I think well I

00:37:09,470 --> 00:37:14,300
can confidently say now it's basically

00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:16,480
non-existent in the environment i'm

00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:19,490
working in and i don't think that way of

00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:24,140
any of my colleagues or anyone that I

00:37:19,490 --> 00:37:26,690
work with anymore at all maybe some of

00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:28,160
the clients we work with can be

00:37:26,690 --> 00:37:30,500
challenging at times and you might

00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:32,360
revert back a little bit actually saying

00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:33,830
that it is there is a good point of your

00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:36,290
made here which I'll come to in a minute

00:37:33,830 --> 00:37:38,780
is that you will find yourself reverting

00:37:36,290 --> 00:37:41,330
back you can't ultimately just go from

00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:43,430
you know this idea of a complete control

00:37:41,330 --> 00:37:44,420
freak to just completely liberated and

00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:46,940
letting go of absolutely everything

00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:48,860
there are points at which you need to

00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:52,490
sort of step in and revert a little bit

00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:54,530
back to that that idea of taking control

00:37:52,490 --> 00:37:57,800
but you wanted you want to let go of it

00:37:54,530 --> 00:37:59,870
as quickly as possible so yeah the idea

00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:01,580
of working working with your colleagues

00:37:59,870 --> 00:38:06,650
working with the teams on a really adult

00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:08,990
kind of level and I don't mean it just

00:38:06,650 --> 00:38:10,400
has to be that way for you as a project

00:38:08,990 --> 00:38:12,410
manager I mean everyone has to get on

00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:16,130
board that everyone needs to be grown-up

00:38:12,410 --> 00:38:17,780
about what you're doing um clearly the

00:38:16,130 --> 00:38:21,170
idea of failure is something that you

00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:23,090
accept back to the idea of this

00:38:21,170 --> 00:38:25,010
common-sense approach it makes sense

00:38:23,090 --> 00:38:28,160
that you're going to fail things are

00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:31,880
going to go wrong what we're working

00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:34,730
with is is complex fortunately what we

00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:36,440
do is not mission-critical it's not life

00:38:34,730 --> 00:38:37,910
threatening you know if something goes

00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:40,270
wrong with a bit of software no one's

00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:43,360
going to die unless of course it's

00:38:40,270 --> 00:38:46,360
software on an aeroplane but um yes so

00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:52,240
the acceptance of failure is is is

00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:54,430
definitely part of this culture and of

00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:56,830
course when you make a mistake you learn

00:38:54,430 --> 00:38:58,510
from it you move on not suggesting that

00:38:56,830 --> 00:39:00,490
you want to just create this environment

00:38:58,510 --> 00:39:02,380
where everybody's okay to screw up all

00:39:00,490 --> 00:39:04,540
the time and you know you just magically

00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:05,890
will get there in the end you want to

00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:09,720
you want to be sure that everyone is

00:39:05,890 --> 00:39:09,720
actually learning from these mistakes

00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:17,410
and rather than an environment that's

00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:19,300
full of anxiety and pressure we want to

00:39:17,410 --> 00:39:21,940
be moving towards this culture of

00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:24,120
happiness I mean we all go to work for

00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:26,920
you know however many hours every week

00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:29,770
spend a huge amount of our lives there

00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:30,970
what's the point really unless unless

00:39:29,770 --> 00:39:32,200
you're enjoying it less you're going to

00:39:30,970 --> 00:39:34,450
be happy unless you're creating this

00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:36,760
culture and environment that that breeds

00:39:34,450 --> 00:39:38,230
this it is actually possible to enjoy

00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:41,800
your work and be happy I strongly

00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:43,420
believe that I have my days but you know

00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:45,160
that really is the aspiration that

00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:46,750
everybody should have and I think that

00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:49,360
you know the whole point of talking

00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:51,760
about what I'm talking today is is that

00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:53,560
I really think that this kind of model

00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:55,480
and I'm only looking at it from a

00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:58,840
project management perspective but this

00:39:55,480 --> 00:40:00,490
kind of model really does lead to people

00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:02,290
being a lot happier on the project and

00:40:00,490 --> 00:40:03,730
if you as a project manager can we

00:40:02,290 --> 00:40:05,620
influence that I think that's something

00:40:03,730 --> 00:40:08,290
that you can gain a huge amount of

00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:09,790
satisfaction out of and it's a sort of

00:40:08,290 --> 00:40:11,200
thing you know get get you out of bed in

00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:17,290
the morning and makes you actually want

00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:19,000
to go to work and then finally in this

00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:20,800
idea of culture rather than the

00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:23,710
three-act structure that I mentioned

00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:25,240
before what you want to get to all this

00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:27,280
sort of culture is one where you

00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:30,550
actually achieve a bit of flow so this

00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:32,020
concept of flow where you really the

00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:33,760
whole team is just working together

00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:36,460
really really well they're producing all

00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:38,740
these great work and you know it just it

00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:41,530
feels right it back to that continuous

00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:44,200
delivery model you you just you're not

00:40:41,530 --> 00:40:45,400
having these different phases working

00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:49,030
through this kind of really

00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:52,650
confrontational kind of exercise it is

00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:52,650
just it just it just works

00:40:55,049 --> 00:41:02,730
so um they're all the concepts that I

00:41:00,039 --> 00:41:09,579
really wanted to cover off today and

00:41:02,730 --> 00:41:13,390
just just to wrap up on the idea of

00:41:09,579 --> 00:41:14,859
control the idea of a centralized model

00:41:13,390 --> 00:41:17,200
of control is really not an effective

00:41:14,859 --> 00:41:19,269
strategy at all I don't think is an

00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:20,769
effective strategy in business and it's

00:41:19,269 --> 00:41:23,950
certainly not an effective strategy for

00:41:20,769 --> 00:41:26,259
projects you really want this control

00:41:23,950 --> 00:41:27,789
that you have as a project manager to be

00:41:26,259 --> 00:41:29,140
distributed right across the team

00:41:27,789 --> 00:41:34,329
everyone needs to have a sense of

00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:36,970
control across the project project

00:41:34,329 --> 00:41:39,849
managers need to be much less managerial

00:41:36,970 --> 00:41:42,069
I mean the title is project manager but

00:41:39,849 --> 00:41:44,470
they want to be much more of a leader

00:41:42,069 --> 00:41:47,289
project leader than a project manager

00:41:44,470 --> 00:41:56,769
and much more focused on from that as

00:41:47,289 --> 00:42:01,049
their role um project should really move

00:41:56,769 --> 00:42:01,049
away from this hierarchical model and

00:42:01,529 --> 00:42:05,440
trying to achieve a much flatter kind of

00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:06,549
structure I mean there's a lot of talk

00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,900
there's always been a lot of talk around

00:42:06,549 --> 00:42:10,869
these idea of flat structures in

00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:13,239
business and they may or may not work

00:42:10,869 --> 00:42:15,009
for some companies but really what

00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:16,450
you're trying to the message to trying

00:42:15,009 --> 00:42:17,619
to get across stairs you just want to

00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:19,329
create a much more collaborative

00:42:17,619 --> 00:42:22,119
environment where the reason this kind

00:42:19,329 --> 00:42:25,779
of you know I'm the boss you know you're

00:42:22,119 --> 00:42:27,759
the worker kind of environment and I

00:42:25,779 --> 00:42:29,289
think if you even if you work within

00:42:27,759 --> 00:42:31,029
those kind of businesses and you work

00:42:29,289 --> 00:42:32,499
with clients who are that way inclined

00:42:31,029 --> 00:42:34,749
or that's their kind of business model I

00:42:32,499 --> 00:42:36,730
think you can still move towards this

00:42:34,749 --> 00:42:40,440
kind of structure on your project so you

00:42:36,730 --> 00:42:42,249
kind of isolate the project from the the

00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:45,239
organization that that you're working

00:42:42,249 --> 00:42:45,239
for or working with

00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:53,310
and so the idea of culture is too

00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:55,350
focused on these culture that recognizes

00:42:53,310 --> 00:42:57,480
projects and the teams of people that

00:42:55,350 --> 00:43:00,390
work on the projects as as a living

00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:02,580
organism not just this this money making

00:43:00,390 --> 00:43:03,960
machine that just cranks out projects

00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:11,940
for the benefit of the business and the

00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:14,520
profit of those who own them um but as I

00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:16,110
kind of mentioned before things you know

00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:17,610
this is not a perfect model things are

00:43:16,110 --> 00:43:19,920
never perfect on these projects that we

00:43:17,610 --> 00:43:21,840
work on a lot of them are still going to

00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:25,950
be challenging a lot of them will still

00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:28,310
fail even if we try and you know exert a

00:43:25,950 --> 00:43:33,920
little less control as a project manager

00:43:28,310 --> 00:43:36,510
so really the aim of my talk today is

00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:39,200
just to be highlighting an hour very

00:43:36,510 --> 00:43:42,600
what I consider a very outdated approach

00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:44,550
to project management and highlight an

00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:46,350
approach that I think is much more

00:43:44,550 --> 00:43:53,400
compatible with the way that we all work

00:43:46,350 --> 00:43:56,310
in the sort of projects that we do so

00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:58,350
what I would what I would say is that if

00:43:56,310 --> 00:44:01,190
any of these stars resonate with you you

00:43:58,350 --> 00:44:03,210
may already be well down the path of

00:44:01,190 --> 00:44:04,620
this kind of model of working as a

00:44:03,210 --> 00:44:07,170
project manager you may be working with

00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:09,660
project managers who are still control

00:44:07,170 --> 00:44:11,040
freaks or as a project manager if you're

00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:12,990
not comfortable kind of throwing away

00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:14,640
the Gantt charts just yet I'm not saying

00:44:12,990 --> 00:44:16,020
that that's something you have to do you

00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:17,310
don't need to throw them away what you

00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:20,460
just need to do is take small steps

00:44:17,310 --> 00:44:23,490
towards being less controlling and

00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:25,020
letting go a little more and I think

00:44:23,490 --> 00:44:27,120
over time as I mentioned before it's

00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:29,070
taken us literally taken us years to

00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:31,890
kind of create this culture in this

00:44:29,070 --> 00:44:34,290
environment but at every step of the way

00:44:31,890 --> 00:44:36,630
we're referring back to this vision in

00:44:34,290 --> 00:44:40,020
this idea that we want to be a lot more

00:44:36,630 --> 00:44:42,000
agile a lot less controlling and reduced

00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:43,650
as project managers reduce the burden on

00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:46,770
ourselves to actually be able to deliver

00:44:43,650 --> 00:44:48,360
these projects more effectively and with

00:44:46,770 --> 00:44:53,400
a bunch of people who are actually happy

00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:55,170
about it so what I would say is if

00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:56,430
you're still stuck in that kind of mode

00:44:55,170 --> 00:44:58,440
of working and you're looking to get out

00:44:56,430 --> 00:45:00,390
of it then just sort of have a think

00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:02,010
about how you want to approach

00:45:00,390 --> 00:45:04,140
your next project and kind of imagine

00:45:02,010 --> 00:45:05,940
something that imagine getting to the

00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:07,859
end of a project and and it's being

00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:10,529
something that people truly value and

00:45:07,859 --> 00:45:12,329
they feel really satisfied with the

00:45:10,529 --> 00:45:15,210
outcome and you know everyone's actually

00:45:12,329 --> 00:45:17,059
very happy ultimately will be a lot more

00:45:15,210 --> 00:45:19,799
enjoyable along the way and the

00:45:17,059 --> 00:45:21,690
experience of the project will be

00:45:19,799 --> 00:45:26,430
something that you know works for

00:45:21,690 --> 00:45:28,260
everyone so yeah again as the project

00:45:26,430 --> 00:45:29,779
manager I think just have a think about

00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:32,069
the sort of steps that you can take

00:45:29,779 --> 00:45:35,010
towards developing a bit of culture and

00:45:32,069 --> 00:45:37,710
developing a mindset yourself and then

00:45:35,010 --> 00:45:41,700
for those around you and don't

00:45:37,710 --> 00:45:44,730
underestimate the capability that people

00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:48,960
you work with have so this idea again

00:45:44,730 --> 00:45:50,700
back to the concept of a team lead or a

00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:51,839
technical team lead and someone who

00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:55,769
thought that kind of your project

00:45:51,839 --> 00:45:59,730
manager well if we if we just left it

00:45:55,769 --> 00:46:03,299
there then we missed out on a hell of a

00:45:59,730 --> 00:46:04,980
lot so what what these people that we've

00:46:03,299 --> 00:46:08,069
been working with have been capable of

00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:09,750
is enormous it's well beyond what you

00:46:08,069 --> 00:46:12,960
know probably their original world they

00:46:09,750 --> 00:46:16,140
thought their original what role was but

00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:18,390
it really has been very eye-opening so I

00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:20,640
take a step back relinquish some of the

00:46:18,390 --> 00:46:22,230
control that you have now to the to the

00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:24,599
people around you and you know see how

00:46:22,230 --> 00:46:30,319
they go see how they perform I think

00:46:24,599 --> 00:46:32,519
you'll be pleasantly surprised so

00:46:30,319 --> 00:46:34,859
distilling this all down into kind of

00:46:32,519 --> 00:46:36,210
one simple rule to apply across all of

00:46:34,859 --> 00:46:38,099
this is a lot of different things you

00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:40,109
can do as I outlined today and a lot of

00:46:38,099 --> 00:46:41,400
different tactics and strategies and

00:46:40,109 --> 00:46:43,109
things that you can think about but I

00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:44,759
think if you kind of run everything

00:46:43,109 --> 00:46:48,359
through these kind of filter or this

00:46:44,759 --> 00:46:50,549
rule it really totally kind of flips the

00:46:48,359 --> 00:46:52,170
mindset from that idea of a controlling

00:46:50,549 --> 00:46:54,779
project managers to one who's a lot more

00:46:52,170 --> 00:46:56,490
open off the controlling project manager

00:46:54,779 --> 00:46:58,289
clearly thinks the process is the more

00:46:56,490 --> 00:46:59,849
important thing the less controlling

00:46:58,289 --> 00:47:02,880
project manager is far more interested

00:46:59,849 --> 00:47:04,349
in the people and and focusing on them

00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:07,069
and getting a really good dynamic going

00:47:04,349 --> 00:47:07,069
on the project

00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:16,109
and just to leave you with one final

00:47:11,890 --> 00:47:18,599
quote from one of my favorite shows I

00:47:16,109 --> 00:47:33,190
strongly believe that this is the case

00:47:18,599 --> 00:47:34,750
so thank you that's it so if you have

00:47:33,190 --> 00:47:53,080
any questions please feel free to ask

00:47:34,750 --> 00:47:55,869
them yep well I did it was all very

00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:59,680
wonderful so back then it was completely

00:47:55,869 --> 00:48:02,530
waterfall but i would say that we we do

00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:03,700
still struggle now with agile and like i

00:48:02,530 --> 00:48:05,530
said before you end up with these

00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:07,420
clashing cultures sometimes with the

00:48:05,530 --> 00:48:11,320
clients and organizations that you work

00:48:07,420 --> 00:48:13,570
with so i think the strategy is to just

00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:17,230
try and introduce some of the concepts

00:48:13,570 --> 00:48:19,540
and the artifacts of agile and try and

00:48:17,230 --> 00:48:22,270
move it more towards an agile approach

00:48:19,540 --> 00:48:25,270
as opposed to a waterfall type project

00:48:22,270 --> 00:48:27,660
and even just little little steps will

00:48:25,270 --> 00:48:27,660
make a big difference

00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:36,039
yeah sure I'm my question is around

00:48:34,539 --> 00:48:40,359
customer management so you mentioned

00:48:36,039 --> 00:48:41,619
that um you set a leadership value early

00:48:40,359 --> 00:48:43,930
on in the relationship with your team

00:48:41,619 --> 00:48:46,210
that failure is okay which i think is

00:48:43,930 --> 00:48:47,559
awesome by the way and the way that we

00:48:46,210 --> 00:48:49,690
should all be doing this and I'm

00:48:47,559 --> 00:48:52,390
wondering how how you translate that

00:48:49,690 --> 00:48:53,799
value to your customer relationship so

00:48:52,390 --> 00:48:56,559
when something goes wrong and your

00:48:53,799 --> 00:48:59,140
customers like who did this which they

00:48:56,559 --> 00:49:01,210
sometimes do what's your answer to that

00:48:59,140 --> 00:49:05,819
in the face of the customer to make sure

00:49:01,210 --> 00:49:08,410
that that that sort of what sort of our

00:49:05,819 --> 00:49:10,869
that personality of your leadership

00:49:08,410 --> 00:49:12,819
style translates to them and that they

00:49:10,869 --> 00:49:14,950
don't go looking for a neck to choke on

00:49:12,819 --> 00:49:18,490
your team or someone to get like fired

00:49:14,950 --> 00:49:20,170
you know yeah well I think we it's not

00:49:18,490 --> 00:49:22,359
about being defensive but it's not about

00:49:20,170 --> 00:49:24,130
um it's not about taking a step back

00:49:22,359 --> 00:49:26,589
from clients either I mean when they

00:49:24,130 --> 00:49:28,119
like that if a client is looking for

00:49:26,589 --> 00:49:31,630
someone to be accountable or someone to

00:49:28,119 --> 00:49:32,680
blame on that I think we actually we

00:49:31,630 --> 00:49:34,359
find yourself getting a little bit

00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:36,430
protective of the teams that you work

00:49:34,359 --> 00:49:39,400
with I mean the whole idea is to just

00:49:36,430 --> 00:49:42,940
work through it and rationalize it with

00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:45,160
them spend the time and just make the

00:49:42,940 --> 00:49:47,500
effort to calm them down essentially so

00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:51,400
sometimes that's that takes a lot of

00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:53,500
time but yeah I look that's really the

00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:56,380
approach is to just try and calm them

00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:58,329
down don't ever you know let somebody in

00:49:56,380 --> 00:50:00,220
your team take the fall for it and again

00:49:58,329 --> 00:50:02,289
it's not about making yourself

00:50:00,220 --> 00:50:03,750
accountable either so this idea that the

00:50:02,289 --> 00:50:05,680
project manager is completely

00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:07,900
responsible for everything in there the

00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:09,700
one who should be fired or they're the

00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:11,380
ones who should be young responsible for

00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:14,380
these things is not true either I think

00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:15,549
I think if you're dealing with dealing

00:50:14,380 --> 00:50:17,069
with that sort of situation you're

00:50:15,549 --> 00:50:20,069
dealing with a pretty difficult person

00:50:17,069 --> 00:50:20,069
so

00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:39,280
yeah definitely

00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:50,900
yep when you pull the line

00:50:59,039 --> 00:51:05,619
yeah I mean it has to be pretty dire for

00:51:01,690 --> 00:51:06,670
us to get to that point I think well to

00:51:05,619 --> 00:51:10,180
be honest I think if you get to that

00:51:06,670 --> 00:51:13,230
point with a client you've kind of

00:51:10,180 --> 00:51:15,279
failed a little bit yourself not

00:51:13,230 --> 00:51:17,890
addressing that earlier or getting to

00:51:15,279 --> 00:51:20,470
the point but look we we have had the

00:51:17,890 --> 00:51:22,240
experience with clients where you get

00:51:20,470 --> 00:51:24,460
these people who are just difficult and

00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:28,390
they will never stop being difficult no

00:51:24,460 --> 00:51:29,470
matter how hard you try and but I think

00:51:28,390 --> 00:51:31,480
the answer your question it's probably

00:51:29,470 --> 00:51:32,769
has to be pretty extreme to get to that

00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:35,289
point I think there's a lot that you can

00:51:32,769 --> 00:51:37,119
do to prevent that sort of situation but

00:51:35,289 --> 00:51:39,819
then again financially you need to be

00:51:37,119 --> 00:51:42,250
protecting yourselves as well to make

00:51:39,819 --> 00:51:44,799
sure that you're not continuing to you

00:51:42,250 --> 00:51:47,109
know add more and more to these

00:51:44,799 --> 00:51:48,579
requirements that that they have all

00:51:47,109 --> 00:51:50,980
these ideas of what you should have

00:51:48,579 --> 00:51:52,750
delivered compared to the specs and sort

00:51:50,980 --> 00:51:55,529
of thing so yeah I think a very extreme

00:51:52,750 --> 00:51:55,529
situation but

00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:04,890
great all right well

00:52:30,799 --> 00:53:06,359
yeah thanks 50 it's great yeah expert

00:52:37,259 --> 00:53:11,519
APA stuff oh sure ahead o Shah press

00:53:06,359 --> 00:53:14,900
tomorrow sector yes we do do a lot of my

00:53:11,519 --> 00:53:14,900
work is different

00:53:15,519 --> 00:53:23,420
well interestingly some of them were

00:53:18,529 --> 00:53:25,220
becoming very nice to difference

00:53:23,420 --> 00:53:27,759
actually I didn't mention there is a

00:53:25,220 --> 00:53:27,759
