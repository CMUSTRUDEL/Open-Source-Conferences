Title: DrupalCon Dublin 2016: Drupal and the physical world: Medical simulators in a learning environment
Publication date: 2016-09-27
Playlist: DrupalCon Dublin 2016
Description: 
	Hardware is increasingly part of our online world. Physical sensors, embedded software, and connected devices are becoming commonplace in modern solutions. Drupal is an ideal tool to adapt these technologies: it can access data from hardware, and create meaning from that data.

Meanwhile, Drupal is reaching more audiences with consistent use cases. Distributions have paved the way for stable and well-supported Drupal platforms, and such platforms are ideally positioned to take advantage of technical innovations. We can develop solutions for hardware integration in Drupal, and distributions make those solutions available to a broader audience.

We were approached by a University research institute that is helping students learn medical procedures with advanced simulator hardware. It sounds a little daunting, but it's best described as "a really advanced game of Operation." We used Opigno LMS, a Drupal distribution, to manage curriculum and courseware. We extended Opigno to receive data from sensors built into medical simulators. This solution provides students with a better way to learn their skills, and gives instructors clear data to measure performance.

In this presentation, we will provide a fun and relatable demonstration of this hardware-integrated solution. We will also introduce you to the highlights of Opigno, explain why we chose it for this project, and describe how we integrated it with simulator hardware.

This presentation is for anyone who is interested in using Drupal to access data from the physical world, or for anyone who is considering Drupal in a learning environment.

	00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:04,920
it's kind of an interesting presentation

00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:07,109
because it covers a lot of ground it's a

00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:10,559
little bit shallow but I hope you guys

00:00:07,109 --> 00:00:11,849
will track us down during whatever the

00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:13,290
rest of the conference and stuff if you

00:00:11,849 --> 00:00:16,770
have any specific questions or anything

00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:18,930
we're going to be talking about Drupal I

00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:20,900
and we're going to be talking about open

00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:24,300
you and we're going to be talking about

00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:26,070
really how we integrated it with sort of

00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:30,480
some third-party kind of custom

00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:33,690
developed solutions a little bit about

00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:36,180
us Jeremiah an ally we are advantaged

00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:38,430
labs we used to be a company of it was

00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:39,570
larger and smaller in the last three or

00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:43,200
four years we ended up being a very

00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:45,379
small company just the two of us and we

00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,850
are really happy being a small company

00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:49,170
partly because you know we don't have to

00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:50,640
compete on big projects we don't have to

00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:54,449
work on major workflows what we end up

00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:57,600
doing is working with generally larger

00:00:54,449 --> 00:00:59,879
problems projects with interesting

00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,190
questions to answer and so we help with

00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:04,409
custom migrations or we help with

00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:07,470
upgrades or we help with custom

00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:09,330
implementation or adding a very unique

00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:11,070
bizarre module to something or something

00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:13,170
like that so we end up getting to do

00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:15,960
like a lowly narrow piece of larger

00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:18,479
projects and that's made of some it

00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:20,310
smells pretty happy we collaborate with

00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:21,990
people who really like to answer

00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:26,970
interesting questions as which was we

00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:28,860
also like to do so we also are really

00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:30,360
active in our local open source tuple

00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:31,740
community we've got a really solid

00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:34,770
community in the Twin Cities of

00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:37,820
Minneapolis Minnesota mid 20th I forgot

00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:40,229
the other city you always do st. Paul

00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:42,420
many of us since they fall in Minnesota

00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:44,460
we have a really active drupalcamp we

00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:47,790
have a really active Drupal community

00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:49,470
within our local university so of just

00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:52,079
about a year and a half ago we were

00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:54,479
hanging out at our local Twin Cities

00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:56,939
drupalcamp and somebody else came to us

00:01:54,479 --> 00:02:00,030
who also likes to ask ask interesting

00:01:56,939 --> 00:02:02,070
questions they are the center for

00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:06,479
research and education and simulation

00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:07,979
technologies AKA crest they've been

00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:10,080
working on a variety of simulation

00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:12,140
technologies and have been investigating

00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,280
different learning management systems

00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:17,090
they

00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:18,319
had an interesting question as well they

00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:22,430
wanted to know how can we use technology

00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:25,880
to make medical training better they had

00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:27,950
been is pretty unethical or at least

00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:29,989
uncomfortable to do medical testing or

00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:34,640
training or learning procedures on live

00:02:29,989 --> 00:02:36,410
human subjects you know most medical

00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:39,560
students at some point in their their

00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:41,270
career practice on cadavers there's some

00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:45,470
scarcity there and they don't offer a

00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:48,220
lot of feedback and so there's been kind

00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:53,300
of an industry associated with

00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:56,360
developing medical simulation so if

00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:59,900
you've ever taken a CPR class you may

00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:01,340
recognize resusci annie it's a great to

00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:03,800
be able to practice procedures on a

00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:05,239
device that can feel no pain simulation

00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,700
is the same for everyone which means you

00:03:05,239 --> 00:03:09,769
can use it in a predictable environment

00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:12,739
everyone who's ever done CPR classes use

00:03:09,769 --> 00:03:15,650
the same dummy in the same way having

00:03:12,739 --> 00:03:17,570
the same tests and you know in the same

00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:19,100
kind of results and it's good to have

00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:22,640
something that consistent in that

00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:24,260
repeatable so that you can really

00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:28,340
measure progress against people or

00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:30,380
develop best practices across a whole

00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:32,450
body of education so it's good to have a

00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:36,549
repeatable reusable simulation device

00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:38,420
that you can't really hurt and then that

00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:40,670
that everybody's gonna be able to make

00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:44,780
use of so there's a huge industry and

00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:47,239
honestly we kind of were surprised by

00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:49,250
what we found when we were looking

00:03:47,239 --> 00:03:51,799
around there's just a major industries

00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:57,440
like of anything you could possibly

00:03:51,799 --> 00:04:04,100
imagine of simulators sensors tests

00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:05,120
dummies body's parts bones tissues just

00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:07,489
whatever you could possibly imagine

00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,980
there's somebody's thought of it and

00:04:07,489 --> 00:04:12,350
again it allows you to have a repeatable

00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:13,790
environment where you can you know

00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:18,229
execute these kinds of tests without

00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:20,820
actually harming anything and and then

00:04:18,229 --> 00:04:23,370
did to develop your skills

00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:28,260
and what drupalcon presentation is

00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:29,220
complete without a cap picture so so for

00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:31,170
the most part these tools have been a

00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:32,750
big help but there's still an important

00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:34,470
question to answer and the question is

00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:39,660
how do you know you're not doing it

00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:41,190
wrong you could be doing this you could

00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:42,060
you could be killing rasasi any every

00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:45,480
single time you wouldn't necessarily

00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:47,340
know it you could take one of these

00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:49,620
devices and you could you know miss

00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:51,180
execute a procedure and you wouldn't you

00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:56,220
know be able to get any feedback about

00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:58,530
it and so you need to start gathering

00:04:56,220 --> 00:05:01,010
objective assessments and so a lot of

00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:03,450
these vices end up having sensors

00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:05,670
buzzers alarms things like that that

00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:07,410
tell you when you're doing it wrong tell

00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:09,900
you when you're doing it right measure

00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:12,720
performance measured you know depth

00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:15,570
accuracy placement you know any type of

00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:20,010
sensors objective assessments of whether

00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:21,570
or not it's being done correctly your

00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:23,400
subjective assessment you could do all

00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:25,140
the objective assessing in the world and

00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:28,680
you wouldn't actually you know be able

00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:30,060
to know that you're doing it right

00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:31,650
unless somebody who knows what they're

00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:33,570
doing can look over your shoulder and be

00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:35,010
like yeah that was right that was wrong

00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:37,260
you should try it this way have you ever

00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:40,320
thought of this and this is how best

00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:42,870
practices are developed so you need some

00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:45,560
kind of human being interaction to to

00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:49,920
validate that you're doing stuff right

00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:51,810
and then once you're actually assessing

00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:54,690
and doing things you need to be able to

00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:56,220
store data like how is one person doing

00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:57,690
are they are they improving or not

00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:59,580
improving house a whole group of people

00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:05,010
improving what does the bell curve look

00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:08,130
like who's who's doing well who's doing

00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:10,290
poorly and how can we again develop best

00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:13,620
practices to educate people better and

00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:16,530
more consistently so objectives

00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:18,420
assessments are you know they were

00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:21,150
consistently they provide feedback the

00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:24,570
results are measurable if you play the

00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:25,920
game operation you know that if you do

00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:27,810
it wrong you're going to get a buzzer

00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:32,169
like you know you use the tweezers to

00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:35,110
pick out the you know water on the knee

00:06:32,169 --> 00:06:37,060
and it you hit the side of it and a

00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:40,270
buzzer goes off and you did it wrong and

00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:42,039
you know it and so you may next time you

00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:47,460
do you're going to be trying really hard

00:06:42,039 --> 00:06:47,460
not to hit the side of that that sensor

00:06:48,749 --> 00:06:59,050
right you can be limited to objective

00:06:57,610 --> 00:07:01,139
assessments you can't be limited to

00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:05,979
objective assessments though because

00:07:01,139 --> 00:07:07,509
again like you could pick up the game

00:07:05,979 --> 00:07:09,370
operation and turn it upside down and

00:07:07,509 --> 00:07:11,139
shake it and you could you know

00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:12,669
successfully get all the pieces out of

00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:14,949
it without actually triggering the

00:07:12,669 --> 00:07:17,169
buzzer wants or you could use a tool

00:07:14,949 --> 00:07:19,569
that is the incorrect tool and not the

00:07:17,169 --> 00:07:21,580
tweezers with the cable attached to it

00:07:19,569 --> 00:07:23,979
and you would be able to get all the

00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:26,919
pieces at without triggering the sensors

00:07:23,979 --> 00:07:28,089
right and so and it's not just malice

00:07:26,919 --> 00:07:29,680
it's not like people are just trying to

00:07:28,089 --> 00:07:31,120
game the system I mean if you have an

00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:35,770
incision that you're trying to learn how

00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:37,629
to find a vein it's like you need to be

00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:39,099
able to know like have somebody look

00:07:37,629 --> 00:07:40,870
over your shoulder and say could you try

00:07:39,099 --> 00:07:45,250
this way or go and you know at this

00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:48,250
other angle or otherwise figure out how

00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:49,990
to learn it better so it's important to

00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:51,699
have subjective assessment or instructor

00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:53,229
vetting someone just properly trained to

00:07:51,699 --> 00:07:55,449
compute the procedure graded offer

00:07:53,229 --> 00:07:57,399
feedback tell you how you can improve

00:07:55,449 --> 00:07:59,500
make sure that people are improving and

00:07:57,399 --> 00:08:00,909
just generally be available for

00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:04,240
instruction and learning knowledge

00:08:00,909 --> 00:08:05,860
transfer and so we've had instructors

00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:09,219
forever like longer than we've anything

00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:12,689
candid simulator at all and we've been

00:08:09,219 --> 00:08:14,830
having more and more devices have

00:08:12,689 --> 00:08:16,629
sensors and equipment and buzzers and

00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:18,699
you know that that technology is

00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:21,009
improving well storing these assessments

00:08:18,699 --> 00:08:22,389
is actually kind of a new horizon and

00:08:21,009 --> 00:08:25,180
it's kind of important because you kind

00:08:22,389 --> 00:08:27,219
of need to build this body of history so

00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:29,830
you need some kind of system to manage

00:08:27,219 --> 00:08:33,339
this content content management system

00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:35,919
perhaps I'm sure you're not surprising

00:08:33,339 --> 00:08:37,269
we're using Drupal for this the people

00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:40,690
that were working with the university

00:08:37,269 --> 00:08:42,519
had actually looked at a number of other

00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:44,950
solutions before they even came to us

00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:46,870
they had a Moodle implementation they

00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:51,370
had a proprietary learning management

00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:53,140
system that they built neither UC

00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:55,050
solutions were flexible enough they

00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:59,220
couldn't get what they needed out of it

00:08:55,050 --> 00:09:01,960
Drupal stores data consistently sort of

00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:04,690
it's highly customizable so you know

00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:06,250
obviously you you can get X percentage

00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:07,870
of the way there let's say eighty

00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:10,990
percent ninety percent and then you can

00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:15,400
build what you need to to bring your

00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:17,410
project home for this particular project

00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:19,510
using things like services to create

00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:22,120
REST API is things like that being able

00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:25,450
to consistently like draw a line between

00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:29,260
what belongs to sensor data belongs to

00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:30,850
to Drupal with a clean API being able to

00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:32,440
build that efficiently and be able to

00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:35,170
change that efficiently was a big deal

00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:36,670
and the broad community of wonderful

00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:39,250
people I mean they're really pretty

00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:41,110
happy too I mean I've been part of

00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:46,060
Drupal for a long time I was it the

00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:48,670
first conference in Antwerp and it's

00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:50,740
nice to know that you can reach out and

00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:52,390
find somebody to help you or find

00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:55,990
somebody with common interests or common

00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:57,550
goals so they came to us because you

00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:59,350
know we knew about Drupal and they knew

00:09:57,550 --> 00:10:02,800
about about the stuff that they were

00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:07,090
working on and they actually introduced

00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:10,600
us to distribution called a pin you to

00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:12,970
learn a management system doesn't the

00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:15,550
functionality that you need for classes

00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:17,620
and content and quizzes and passing and

00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:19,840
failing and all that stuff and group

00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:21,400
curriculum you could imagine how you

00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:24,450
might build something with organic

00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:26,800
groups and and and other and other tools

00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:28,030
but that would take a lot of work and so

00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,680
thankfully there is a learning

00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:35,860
management distribution that has done

00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:39,420
that work for you it it does exactly you

00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:42,550
know has security has groups it has

00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:44,950
courses students grouped our group by

00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:47,650
course lessons go into to those courses

00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:49,030
and you can and gather assessments

00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:52,600
in-store knowledge so really everything

00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:55,090
that you actually want to store from

00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:56,889
this this technology is there except for

00:10:55,090 --> 00:11:06,069
the the bridge between that

00:10:56,889 --> 00:11:09,879
nology in the content so a couple

00:11:06,069 --> 00:11:12,309
built-in things with open yo we've got

00:11:09,879 --> 00:11:16,059
sort of courses and so a medical student

00:11:12,309 --> 00:11:21,999
has logged in and this is some courses

00:11:16,059 --> 00:11:26,649
that they're participating in and those

00:11:21,999 --> 00:11:31,509
courses group lessons it's really hard

00:11:26,649 --> 00:11:34,089
to see you there but there's individual

00:11:31,509 --> 00:11:35,859
lessons where you can have different

00:11:34,089 --> 00:11:38,439
slides of content different curriculum

00:11:35,859 --> 00:11:39,699
videos really pretty much any type of

00:11:38,439 --> 00:11:42,009
multimedia you want I'm actually

00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:47,859
impressed with the robust nature of that

00:11:42,009 --> 00:11:49,509
content management and inside of an

00:11:47,859 --> 00:11:52,899
individual lesson you can put any type

00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:56,379
of content you want these nice little

00:11:52,899 --> 00:11:57,999
like back forth start lesson and it

00:11:56,379 --> 00:12:00,040
keeps track of where you're at it keeps

00:11:57,999 --> 00:12:02,019
track of how you're doing keeps track of

00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:04,449
versioning so that you can you know

00:12:02,019 --> 00:12:05,529
change the lesson contents and people

00:12:04,449 --> 00:12:08,230
are actually pinned to a specific

00:12:05,529 --> 00:12:10,899
version of what they're learning so you

00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:16,660
don't have results change as the the

00:12:10,899 --> 00:12:19,509
underlying version changes such a

00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:22,480
surprisingly solid system for that kind

00:12:19,509 --> 00:12:27,579
of stuff you know this content that we

00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:31,029
have is not all that all that exciting

00:12:27,579 --> 00:12:33,610
but but it's a good way to just store

00:12:31,029 --> 00:12:36,970
chunks of information and page through

00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:40,059
it and keep track of it I mean I've I've

00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:42,910
been happy with that it's also got

00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:44,319
built-in like quizzes you know subject

00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:46,029
matter assessment you can assess

00:12:44,319 --> 00:12:49,720
knowledge using a variety of multiple

00:12:46,029 --> 00:12:51,869
choice or other question types it's a

00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:54,339
good way to provide content review

00:12:51,869 --> 00:12:56,319
knowledge review on the information

00:12:54,339 --> 00:13:01,359
that's been presented that stuff's

00:12:56,319 --> 00:13:05,439
pretty pretty helpful the university had

00:13:01,359 --> 00:13:06,850
developed these devices and they wanted

00:13:05,439 --> 00:13:08,860
objective test results from their

00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:09,880
learning machines to appear as objective

00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:12,310
results and the system

00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:14,740
so I mean as opposed to a yes or no

00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:17,020
question do you understand the content

00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:21,130
you can't ask that but you can say did

00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:22,870
you kill that guy right and and be able

00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:25,450
to get a yes/no answer so that's really

00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:27,730
the the name of the game for us was to

00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:31,450
be able to answer that question to kill

00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:34,710
bad guy or whatever other type of emetic

00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:34,710
of assessment that we can do from that

00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:41,500
the sky dr. Jonathan Bremen at

00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:43,090
department of orthopaedic surgery at the

00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:45,190
University of Minnesota has been working

00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:46,420
with these kind of devices he's been

00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:48,820
providing a lot of feedback and

00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:56,520
participation on developing these

00:13:48,820 --> 00:14:07,660
particular boxes and how do you like OOP

00:13:56,520 --> 00:14:13,770
know the sound is in there that's a

00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:13,770
helpful there's our tech go away

00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:26,890
yeah there's a lot of fun um I don't

00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:32,710
know how to make it stop either I'm just

00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:37,780
going back back back good is this slide

00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:45,450
and it's not going tempted to just yank

00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:45,450
the get back to my desk

00:14:54,850 --> 00:15:02,259
what are you doing I'm checking the

00:14:56,860 --> 00:15:10,769
sound settings it's trying to go out

00:15:02,259 --> 00:15:10,769
through the hdmi let's try that

00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:19,649
the goal of this simulator project is to

00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:21,089
try to make sure that orthopedic

00:15:19,649 --> 00:15:24,839
surgeons in training who are learning

00:15:21,089 --> 00:15:26,720
how to do small joint minimally invasive

00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:30,779
surgery have the skills that they need

00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:33,089
to move from to move safely from the

00:15:30,779 --> 00:15:35,570
untrained environment into working in

00:15:33,089 --> 00:15:38,640
the operating room on real patients in

00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:40,290
the past that were no great tools for

00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:41,730
teaching some of the skills and they're

00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:44,580
very different from the skills that we

00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:47,730
learn in open surgery consequently we

00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:50,250
developed these two simulators one to

00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:52,980
teach the goal of visualizing something

00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:56,089
in space and triangulating with the with

00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:59,040
the tool to press on different spaces

00:15:56,089 --> 00:16:01,440
the second skill was to manipulate

00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:04,950
objects in space again using the

00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:08,310
arthroscope for a small joint camera to

00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:11,160
move things around practicing in both of

00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:13,860
these environments by manual or both

00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:15,390
handedness using the camera in both the

00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:17,190
left and the right hand and then

00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:19,980
manipulating things with the opposite

00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:22,980
hand the combination of those skills

00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:26,520
sets the foundation for moving forward

00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:28,890
and learning more complex knee shoulder

00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:32,910
ankle elbow and wrist arthroscopy

00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:36,060
techniques and enables us as surgical

00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:38,070
educators to teach the trainees the

00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:41,160
things that can only be learned in the

00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:43,110
operating room on real patients while

00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:45,089
they because they've learned things that

00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:51,149
can be learned outside of the operating

00:16:45,089 --> 00:16:52,140
room using these simulators okay so I

00:16:51,149 --> 00:16:54,209
mean there's a variety of different

00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:56,550
types of applications of simulators in

00:16:54,209 --> 00:16:58,410
this one back to a skill building can I

00:16:56,550 --> 00:17:00,149
know you've tried to use this and it's

00:16:58,410 --> 00:17:03,839
just that it's not all that fun to watch

00:17:00,149 --> 00:17:08,730
it's really hard actually it is actually

00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:11,069
a skill that you have to build and so I

00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:13,589
mean we want people to be able to work

00:17:11,069 --> 00:17:17,819
on these devices and be able to get

00:17:13,589 --> 00:17:20,490
information about how it went and track

00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:23,010
that data within the same system where

00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:26,970
we're providing the content and courses

00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:29,850
and in assessments of other data that's

00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:32,730
you know subject matter review and so

00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:36,420
this is the output of a particular test

00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:40,170
or a particular exercise that that one

00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:42,900
of us ran and what can you explain the

00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:44,880
church yeah so on this particular

00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:48,570
display which we added we're just

00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:51,180
showing the overall result over time so

00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:53,790
you can track how a student's improved

00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:55,830
or not as they've gone through the

00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:57,210
exercise multiple times which is one of

00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:59,120
the things that they really wanted to be

00:17:57,210 --> 00:18:01,710
able to track for these studies and and

00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:04,700
watching how their trainees are

00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:08,280
improving through the use of these tools

00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:09,810
and we have other displays for when

00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:11,970
you're looking at an individual results

00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:15,720
where you can see a timeline of

00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:20,880
information about different things that

00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:23,610
occurred during the assessment different

00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:25,410
sensors that were triggered or or how

00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:32,400
long it took them to perform the

00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:35,010
procedure the first exercise is very

00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:37,550
much renovation is designed to teach the

00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:40,680
user to move around incites the

00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:42,180
simulator and manually press on objects

00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:44,340
using the left and the right hands it

00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:46,170
requires a couple of attempts to switch

00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:48,090
the camera to the left hand and back to

00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:51,900
the right as well as the probe in the

00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:54,060
opposite hand this this begins with the

00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:56,340
scope box properly attached to the

00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:58,050
monitor and the LMS activated and it

00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:59,900
begins with both the scope and the probe

00:18:58,050 --> 00:19:03,750
in the registers on the side of the box

00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:05,220
it will begin by placing the scope in

00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:07,020
one hand and the probe in the other and

00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:09,870
identifying which of the target lights

00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:11,550
is on in this instance the target light

00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:13,620
is nearest to the front of the box and

00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:15,450
on the left hand side and consequently

00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:17,400
that probe that target can only be hit

00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:20,220
by moving the scope to the left right

00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:22,530
hand and the probe to the left once that

00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:24,360
target is depressed the next light will

00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:26,970
light up allowing the probe to move

00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:29,040
forward and identify where the targets

00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:32,190
are at it may be worthwhile to do this

00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:34,280
exercise in a darkened room in order to

00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:36,690
facilitate visualization inside the box

00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:38,100
now this next target is

00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:39,540
on the top of the box but on the

00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:40,710
right-hand side of the box and

00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:42,870
consequently can only be hit with a

00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:46,410
scope in the left hand and the probe in

00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:50,100
the right and then moving forward in the

00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:52,440
back and now identifying where the next

00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:54,870
target is in the front of the box again

00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:56,610
switching the probe to the left hand so

00:19:54,870 --> 00:20:03,480
that I can reach this target on the

00:19:56,610 --> 00:20:08,880
floor of the simulator right there right

00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:10,440
there there it is there that's on the

00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:13,170
other side so switching back to put the

00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:18,990
probe in the right hand so that I can

00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:21,390
reliably probe that and then moving the

00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:24,060
last target once the last target is hit

00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:26,580
the LMS will notify you and you can end

00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:28,740
the simulator by placing a throwback in

00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:33,750
the registers and also the stroke back

00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:35,400
and these days you got to see one of our

00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:42,450
other colleagues in the background in

00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:45,510
the video so in addition to capturing

00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:48,390
those results right so like this is

00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:52,280
where this is that yeah so this is where

00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:54,660
they were hitting the targets right and

00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:57,330
um in addition to storing those

00:20:54,660 --> 00:21:02,730
objectives test results assorted oh god

00:20:57,330 --> 00:21:11,130
let's go forward again no hdmi it's very

00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:14,790
touchy there we go again um another

00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:17,550
thing that was happening is it can also

00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:21,840
record video during the event during the

00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:24,570
training event and match those videos

00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:26,430
with those those results and allow an

00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:28,560
instructor to come along later and watch

00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:30,960
the videos and you know make those

00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:32,580
subjective assessments and so this is

00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:35,310
actually different projects wides asking

00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:39,930
kind of off-the-wall questions you know

00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:42,540
ba head placement but we're able to we

00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:47,400
create questions that are subjective in

00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:49,130
nature and allow instructors to revisit

00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:51,710
a

00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:53,990
the student test results and add

00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:56,000
additional information and have their

00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:59,200
their scores factored into the overall

00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:02,210
results of the students so now we have

00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:04,520
objective you know assessment of like

00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:07,370
you know sensor sentence didn't send

00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:08,780
information and timed it and did

00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:12,440
whatever metrics that we needed to do

00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:13,910
for to validate that lesson we also know

00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:15,800
how subjective assessments of

00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:18,470
instructors being able to sit down and

00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:21,560
watch and and decide whether or not as

00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:23,030
students did a good job and it's a time

00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:24,590
saver right because they don't have to

00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:26,300
sit down and participate it with each

00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:27,740
and every student if there's multiple

00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:29,750
runs and like the whole bunch of

00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:31,010
objectively failed you know the

00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:32,420
instructor doesn't necessarily have to

00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:37,190
sit down and watch every single one of

00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:38,780
them so it's a really big time saver to

00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:41,870
be able to manage it this way and have

00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:43,520
it all in one place as well as is just

00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:48,200
having the just the bra technology

00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:51,560
available and one of the things they

00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:53,630
that dr. Bremen wants to be able to do

00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:55,610
with these boxes has actually send sets

00:22:53,630 --> 00:22:58,670
home with medical students so they not

00:22:55,610 --> 00:23:01,850
only can come in and perform the tasks

00:22:58,670 --> 00:23:03,230
in a classroom environment and try to

00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:05,900
get training that way but they can take

00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:07,580
them home and practice and and try to

00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:09,710
develop their skills their dexterity

00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:12,680
with switching instruments and scopes

00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:14,510
and whatnot on their own time and then

00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:17,180
come back for final assessment before

00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:20,950
they move on to working with cadavers

00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:20,950
and then going at the actual are

00:23:27,279 --> 00:23:32,570
so yeah so you know we have it all kind

00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:42,860
of going on in one oh my god did you do

00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:49,179
that did that even happen that all right

00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:52,299
no no I don't think the tapes helping

00:23:49,179 --> 00:23:56,929
there you go hey nobody touch anything

00:23:52,299 --> 00:23:58,909
um yeah so it's all in one place it's

00:23:56,929 --> 00:24:01,399
all you know like every student has like

00:23:58,909 --> 00:24:03,320
a good history associated with them and

00:24:01,399 --> 00:24:04,759
in fact the orthopaedic department at

00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:08,840
the U of M will be launching a study

00:24:04,759 --> 00:24:12,320
using the simulator boxes probably this

00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:13,639
fall for sure and so they'll be able to

00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:18,200
kind of really test it in a real-world

00:24:13,639 --> 00:24:19,999
environment as well so getting to just

00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:21,590
the sort of overall nuts and bolts of it

00:24:19,999 --> 00:24:25,429
all how do we get this information from

00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:28,879
the sensors devices you know into into a

00:24:25,429 --> 00:24:30,799
data drupal and I guess I let you talk

00:24:28,879 --> 00:24:38,960
about some of that stuff yeah-hoo

00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:42,259
trading sure okay so this just kind of

00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:44,269
highlights the overall workflow between

00:24:42,259 --> 00:24:47,119
everything so this slide is actually

00:24:44,269 --> 00:24:50,509
talking about the airway trainer but the

00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:53,179
the workflow is the same for these these

00:24:50,509 --> 00:24:57,879
trainers as well the airway trainer was

00:24:53,179 --> 00:25:01,610
for learning how to do into intubation

00:24:57,879 --> 00:25:04,399
so you have the trainer itself that has

00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:06,679
sensors built-in it's got an Arduino at

00:25:04,399 --> 00:25:09,139
its core that's reading the sensor data

00:25:06,679 --> 00:25:13,220
and has libraries on it to communicate

00:25:09,139 --> 00:25:16,039
back over USB with a google chrome

00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:18,740
plugin that's running on the students

00:25:16,039 --> 00:25:21,169
laptop and that's sort of re our gateway

00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:25,429
between the hardware world and the lms

00:25:21,169 --> 00:25:28,309
so the lms side we've got a penny Oh

00:25:25,429 --> 00:25:32,799
maintaining all of our curriculum and

00:25:28,309 --> 00:25:35,570
with the integration for for this stuff

00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:38,330
and we also have a current o media

00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:39,740
server in theory that's still kind of a

00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:42,860
work in progress

00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:45,550
as a video store for the web RTC video

00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:48,830
so when the students performing the task

00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:50,809
any video from the scope or from other

00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:54,140
camera sources depending on the test

00:25:50,809 --> 00:25:57,350
will be streaming from the plug-in back

00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:58,880
to the media server and those records

00:25:57,350 --> 00:26:03,170
will get associated with the students

00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:05,570
result in the LMS when those so we

00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:08,300
communicate through with a plug-in / /

00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:11,120
rest and it communicates back with us /

00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:14,020
rest api provided by services and then

00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:21,020
it's providing the gateway through USB

00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:23,179
HID to the actual hardware so the

00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:26,809
workflow as a student when you're coming

00:26:23,179 --> 00:26:29,179
into the system you login you go to your

00:26:26,809 --> 00:26:31,010
course you go through all your other

00:26:29,179 --> 00:26:34,070
curriculum material describing the

00:26:31,010 --> 00:26:35,929
exercises answer whatever questions

00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:37,790
there might be pre tests or other things

00:26:35,929 --> 00:26:39,290
that are a more traditional test format

00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:40,970
and then you get to the point of doing

00:26:39,290 --> 00:26:42,770
the exercise where you've got the boxes

00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:46,520
on the table and you're ready to ready

00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:48,830
to go so you click start lesson and at

00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:50,690
this point we're intercepting that click

00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:53,059
with a little bit of JavaScript that

00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:55,250
will launch the chrome plugin and sort

00:26:53,059 --> 00:26:59,570
of give it information about the rest

00:26:55,250 --> 00:27:01,940
endpoint for the lms the app the chrome

00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:03,110
app then comes back and hits the api and

00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:05,929
get some additional configuration

00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:08,300
information that the faculty person is

00:27:05,929 --> 00:27:11,360
has entered for the parameters on how

00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:15,080
they want the assessment to occur how

00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:18,200
long should it take at maximum how how

00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:20,960
long of a touch can you have on a sensor

00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:24,650
before it registers an error state that

00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:26,990
kind of information so then the student

00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:29,059
performs the assessment they go through

00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:31,550
they they poke the little lights off or

00:27:29,059 --> 00:27:34,690
whatnot they trigger some errors they

00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:37,460
hopefully don't kill the patient and

00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:39,440
when they complete the plugin street

00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:42,140
sends the video as i said back over

00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:44,900
WebRTC to the media server it sends a

00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:47,960
rest request back to the lms to drupal

00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:49,880
with a payload of of the raw data the

00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:52,070
exercise all of the error states that

00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:52,580
occurred and some other stuff that we're

00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:55,250
capturing

00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:58,760
that more discreetly like what what was

00:27:55,250 --> 00:28:02,120
a start time how long did it take did

00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:04,519
they succeed or fail so that act that

00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:06,860
actual success value gets determined by

00:28:04,519 --> 00:28:12,110
the trainer itself and get sent back to

00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:14,480
Drupal yeah yeah so all the business

00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:16,820
logic about did they kill the patient or

00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:18,830
not lives on the trainer and it makes

00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:21,679
that determination based on all the live

00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:24,500
data and then we store everything

00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:26,600
against the student record so that as we

00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:29,330
said before you can sort of track us in

00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:36,919
individual's performance as they go

00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:38,860
through and use these tools so from a

00:28:36,919 --> 00:28:41,480
nuts-and-bolts thing stuff that we did

00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:44,750
we extended the quiz module which is

00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:46,279
part of the opinion distribution is to

00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:52,610
add some additional question types

00:28:46,279 --> 00:28:58,010
that's how it interacts with with making

00:28:52,610 --> 00:28:59,389
it so that you have data so rather than

00:28:58,010 --> 00:29:01,250
just having a question type that's

00:28:59,389 --> 00:29:05,539
multiple choice we have a question that

00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:08,299
is simulated result so we have somewhere

00:29:05,539 --> 00:29:10,100
to store our data against we've got

00:29:08,299 --> 00:29:11,750
another question type for the instructor

00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:13,490
assessments that you saw before it's

00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:16,100
sort of a rubric rating system and

00:29:13,490 --> 00:29:17,690
rather than the student answering the

00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:20,389
question and having that effect their

00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:22,730
score the instructor can come back and

00:29:20,389 --> 00:29:25,340
review the results through watching the

00:29:22,730 --> 00:29:28,340
video in assessing other data that's

00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:30,110
provided and answer the questions as to

00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:34,850
what how the student did and where they

00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:36,080
might have room for improvement as as we

00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:38,149
mentioned we're using the services

00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:39,919
module to provide the rest api so that

00:29:38,149 --> 00:29:43,850
we can hook talk back and forth with a

00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:46,309
chrome app we've got a custom entity

00:29:43,850 --> 00:29:48,200
type that we've set up that we're using

00:29:46,309 --> 00:29:51,649
to store the configurations for the

00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:55,159
devices so when you get a set of these

00:29:51,649 --> 00:29:58,700
boxes or a new new trainer is developed

00:29:55,159 --> 00:30:01,760
there'd be a package that you'd upload

00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:05,630
to the lms that would contain a llamo

00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:06,080
file with configuration data some CSS

00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:10,120
ass

00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:13,460
HTML Javascript assets that then when

00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:16,370
session is is instantiated we the

00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:18,140
trainer grabs at information the chrome

00:30:16,370 --> 00:30:22,100
plugin grabs that information to kind of

00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:24,289
build the UI out a little bit more and

00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:28,250
so all that's stored in its own entity

00:30:24,289 --> 00:30:32,559
type so that it can be referenced to

00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:32,559
these questions and updated later on

00:30:32,890 --> 00:30:43,820
fundamentally I mean it's so much i

00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:45,200
touch to thing oh alright but like the

00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:47,330
the surprising thing about this is that

00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:50,019
how little we actually had to do I mean

00:30:47,330 --> 00:30:52,039
it sounds like a lot but I mean

00:30:50,019 --> 00:30:53,659
implementing an entity type and

00:30:52,039 --> 00:30:55,220
installing the services module and

00:30:53,659 --> 00:30:57,080
extending modules that were already

00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:59,059
there was actual work but it was not

00:30:57,080 --> 00:31:01,010
nearly the same undertaking is

00:30:59,059 --> 00:31:02,929
developing a learning management system

00:31:01,010 --> 00:31:05,929
or storing data are you know anything

00:31:02,929 --> 00:31:08,419
like that so I ended up being a good fit

00:31:05,929 --> 00:31:16,539
for for Drupal surprisingly surprisingly

00:31:08,419 --> 00:31:19,070
well okay and now we can do a demo

00:31:16,539 --> 00:31:22,519
rather than fumble around inside these

00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:23,779
boxes which if anyone wants to after if

00:31:22,519 --> 00:31:26,559
we do a before something later in the

00:31:23,779 --> 00:31:29,149
week you can you're welcome to try

00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:30,710
they're fun to use but they can be a

00:31:29,149 --> 00:31:34,370
little intimidating so we've actually

00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:39,610
got another device that they set up for

00:31:34,370 --> 00:31:39,610
us you may recognize it from earlier on

00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:46,360
hopefully I don't screw up the laptop by

00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:46,360
plugging this in

00:31:51,240 --> 00:32:13,450
just going to so they hacked a game of

00:31:58,690 --> 00:32:15,370
operation for us so let's see here so

00:32:13,450 --> 00:32:17,610
we've logged into the LMS as a medical

00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:22,769
student we're in the operation operation

00:32:17,610 --> 00:32:28,710
course lesson oh of course there's not

00:32:22,769 --> 00:32:28,710
can you switch that yeah I get to see it

00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:49,070
that didn't do what I wanted because I

00:32:41,909 --> 00:32:49,070
moved it over there can you just

00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,530
here we go

00:33:02,410 --> 00:33:09,340
alright so we're in opinion right now

00:33:06,970 --> 00:33:13,260
this is a demo site that we've got set

00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:15,790
up we're logged in as a medical student

00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:18,210
we're in our lesson and we're ready to

00:33:15,790 --> 00:33:22,980
go so we can go ahead and click start

00:33:18,210 --> 00:33:22,980
it's going to launch the chrome plugin

00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:30,220
wonderful you I have a little bit of

00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:35,290
work to do on some of the CSS and we can

00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:41,620
tell it we're ready to go and so now we

00:33:35,290 --> 00:34:00,880
can go in and see how we do oh did it no

00:33:41,620 --> 00:34:05,470
trigger there we go one error oh that's

00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:07,180
not this worked right before that's the

00:34:05,470 --> 00:34:18,450
curse of live demonstrations at a

00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:18,450
conference now triggering

00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:35,090
oops you're terrible doctor yeah well

00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:59,720
let's see here we're just gonna start

00:34:40,770 --> 00:34:59,720
over rainy

00:35:18,890 --> 00:35:30,369
right you're not going to work are you

00:35:30,519 --> 00:35:43,579
don't they went off there we go so it's

00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:45,650
throwing some little blue lights on the

00:35:43,579 --> 00:35:49,339
screen to let you know which one to do

00:35:45,650 --> 00:35:51,380
next and it's got some tall effect

00:35:49,339 --> 00:35:55,430
sensors there's a little magnets it

00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:58,660
glued to these pieces to know when

00:35:55,430 --> 00:36:04,220
you've actually got got it out of there

00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:08,859
and we're done scored zero percent

00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:12,859
awesome did you kill that guy yes yeah

00:36:08,859 --> 00:36:15,920
so once you perform that it it closes

00:36:12,859 --> 00:36:18,650
out and you can go in and take a look at

00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:20,799
the results so there's some testing in

00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:24,859
here from our or call you again and

00:36:20,799 --> 00:36:31,269
here's our result from the last time we

00:36:24,859 --> 00:36:33,230
just did and it's logging it it's gotta

00:36:31,269 --> 00:36:39,410
graphing some of the errors that

00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:40,910
occurred and we can go back I had a

00:36:39,410 --> 00:36:42,680
little bit better performance right

00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:45,640
before the presentation I got seventy

00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:45,640
percent so

00:36:53,829 --> 00:36:56,789
let's go back

00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:07,020
alright

00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:13,980
so I guess you're supposed to tell you

00:37:10,650 --> 00:37:17,400
to evaluate the session um and and we're

00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:19,980
I guess just go to as the whole schedule

00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:22,380
the generic schedule URL and also ah

00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:25,050
join us for the contributions prints on

00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:26,490
Friday in terms of just this

00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:29,340
presentation if you have any questions

00:37:26,490 --> 00:37:31,170
comments interest especially especially

00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:32,160
because they're visiting here because

00:37:31,170 --> 00:37:33,960
you're doing something similar

00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:38,840
interesting I'd really like to hear

00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:41,970
about it anyone have any questions I

00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:47,990
think you'd yeah they want us want us to

00:37:41,970 --> 00:37:47,990
try to use the yeah okay blurry be

00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:06,830
something you are managing some way

00:38:09,890 --> 00:38:21,930
solved by using Oh as far as they will

00:38:15,930 --> 00:38:23,700
act well I mean it's fortunately because

00:38:21,930 --> 00:38:25,350
you're kind of confined by a group of

00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:27,240
students for a particular class or

00:38:25,350 --> 00:38:28,800
something like that we've thus far been

00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:33,350
able to I mean we're planning on just

00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:36,630
using the media server and we can

00:38:33,350 --> 00:38:38,640
understand which files came from which

00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:41,070
class and archive them accordingly as

00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:43,680
time goes by the actual sensor data

00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:46,530
we're storing just in JSON and it's not

00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:48,330
that I mean yeah I mean as we said

00:38:46,530 --> 00:38:51,420
before most of the business rule logic

00:38:48,330 --> 00:38:53,640
is happening on the trainer itself and

00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:56,550
so we don't get a whole lot of data back

00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:59,190
from it besides mostly what you saw out

00:38:56,550 --> 00:39:00,930
there yeah there's some bits and pieces

00:38:59,190 --> 00:39:02,820
we pull out like the score and the

00:39:00,930 --> 00:39:11,040
timestamp information and things like

00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:13,520
that and then yeah we don't get the raw

00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:16,920
fees yeah yeah I know precisely yeah

00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:19,080
yeah yeah in the in these cases for

00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:20,740
these devices the LMS isn't necessarily

00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:22,930
something there instituting across

00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:27,790
entire university for everything it's

00:39:22,930 --> 00:39:31,000
more to store curriculum and information

00:39:27,790 --> 00:39:33,610
as it relates just to like the or

00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:35,170
orthopedic students so students going

00:39:33,610 --> 00:39:38,050
through that particular program and then

00:39:35,170 --> 00:39:39,760
there might be if they're become other

00:39:38,050 --> 00:39:41,860
programs and other trainers and they

00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:44,140
might have their own instance or perhaps

00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:47,290
combine them but at least with these

00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:49,840
devices we're talking about for the most

00:39:47,290 --> 00:39:52,119
part individual institutions will that

00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:55,960
are interested in using them for their

00:39:52,119 --> 00:39:57,580
students will buy a few sets of the

00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:59,800
devices and they'll get a subscription

00:39:57,580 --> 00:40:05,080
to the LMS and then they can come in and

00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:06,940
and have their own data while there is a

00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:09,369
fair amount of video as I said we don't

00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:13,740
necessarily need to keep all of it we're

00:40:09,369 --> 00:40:17,020
keeping will keep video around for a

00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:20,350
sort of whatever makes sense the last

00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:23,070
three times the last ten attempts the

00:40:20,350 --> 00:40:26,020
upshot is of course using using Drupal

00:40:23,070 --> 00:40:28,750
for something that's this niche is that

00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:30,430
if it did get broadly instituted somehow

00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:32,740
and you have scalability questions

00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:34,300
that's a question that's been very very

00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:37,200
handily addressed in a number of ways

00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:37,200
throughout the Drupal community

00:40:47,799 --> 00:40:56,629
it's not pretty I think at the database

00:40:53,769 --> 00:41:01,909
yeah i mean i could probably login and

00:40:56,629 --> 00:41:08,289
show you the database the the most of

00:41:01,909 --> 00:41:11,479
the extra data that we're storing is a

00:41:08,289 --> 00:41:14,809
timestamp with some metadata about what

00:41:11,479 --> 00:41:20,239
the error state was and that's about it

00:41:14,809 --> 00:41:23,119
so yeah and I guess part of that is you

00:41:20,239 --> 00:41:25,459
know we we developed with with our

00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:27,709
partner like exactly what we get back so

00:41:25,459 --> 00:41:32,089
it could be anything will we get in this

00:41:27,709 --> 00:41:34,159
JSON payload but most of that business

00:41:32,089 --> 00:41:35,839
were like what develops that Jason is

00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:40,609
that it's kind of out of our

00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:42,739
jurisdiction so like the actual yes yep

00:41:40,609 --> 00:41:46,779
exactly there the chrome app I think

00:41:42,739 --> 00:41:50,479
actually is processing that information

00:41:46,779 --> 00:41:52,099
so what we get back could be anything as

00:41:50,479 --> 00:41:54,979
dictated by that that sort of

00:41:52,099 --> 00:41:57,309
intermediate app and what does Jeremiah

00:41:54,979 --> 00:42:02,089
was saying what we do get back is not

00:41:57,309 --> 00:42:10,209
all that comprehensive really you're

00:42:02,089 --> 00:42:12,889
just gonna shell out there we'll see and

00:42:10,209 --> 00:42:15,849
so that's also something that you know

00:42:12,889 --> 00:42:21,979
right now we are just storing the data

00:42:15,849 --> 00:42:25,789
I'm pretty much raw and then one of the

00:42:21,979 --> 00:42:27,799
he's slightly down the road things that

00:42:25,789 --> 00:42:31,579
we want to do is define some other

00:42:27,799 --> 00:42:34,339
objects or entity types for defining and

00:42:31,579 --> 00:42:36,229
defining some of the data structure so

00:42:34,339 --> 00:42:40,129
that we can come up with a common

00:42:36,229 --> 00:42:42,409
language between the devices and the LMS

00:42:40,129 --> 00:42:45,499
so that we can do a little bit more with

00:42:42,409 --> 00:42:47,419
the data we're storing right now to like

00:42:45,499 --> 00:42:50,389
put some of the graph data on the screen

00:42:47,419 --> 00:42:52,429
or or things like that we're just kind

00:42:50,389 --> 00:42:55,789
of iterating over whatever was provided

00:42:52,429 --> 00:42:57,480
and creating some custom displays don't

00:42:55,789 --> 00:42:59,310
have a lot of integration into something

00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:02,790
use right now so you could generate your

00:42:59,310 --> 00:43:04,020
own reports yeah but exactly defining

00:43:02,790 --> 00:43:06,600
that common language I think it's

00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:12,930
something that would be useful for all

00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:16,770
that yeah very interesting I pray that

00:43:12,930 --> 00:43:23,609
you work and questioning that line is is

00:43:16,770 --> 00:43:26,130
this where you usually work with

00:43:23,609 --> 00:43:28,080
physical objects and what's your

00:43:26,130 --> 00:43:30,960
experience with this you think this is

00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:38,970
expanding if it's becoming a bit more

00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:41,490
popular to use no I don't think it's not

00:43:38,970 --> 00:43:43,800
coming right now so question is if we

00:43:41,490 --> 00:43:46,680
have we do this a lot work with with

00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:48,960
this type of hardware integration and if

00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:50,820
it's growing and I we this is kind of a

00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:53,220
new project for us like I said we like

00:43:50,820 --> 00:43:54,930
to take on interesting projects people

00:43:53,220 --> 00:44:00,180
asking interesting questions that one

00:43:54,930 --> 00:44:02,340
definitely qualifies and i think that

00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:03,720
there's more and more interesting

00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:05,090
applications for em and i know that

00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:07,320
we're we're kind of talking about like

00:44:05,090 --> 00:44:10,170
setting up hardware sensors for our

00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:11,970
garden eight and building them into a

00:44:10,170 --> 00:44:13,920
drupal instance to tell us when de to

00:44:11,970 --> 00:44:17,940
water our flower beds or things like

00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:19,920
that there's any number of you know all

00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:21,330
kinds of new sensors for all kinds of

00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:22,800
different reasons there's all kinds of

00:44:21,330 --> 00:44:25,109
like walled gardens of proprietary

00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:27,570
systems that are interacting with that

00:44:25,109 --> 00:44:29,010
that hardware data that i think would be

00:44:27,570 --> 00:44:31,200
more interesting if you could get that

00:44:29,010 --> 00:44:36,230
data in order to interact with something

00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:36,230
like drupal so yep

00:44:42,830 --> 00:44:49,620
it it's some custom code one of our

00:44:47,610 --> 00:45:16,860
other colleagues who's working more on

00:44:49,620 --> 00:45:19,200
the hardware side wrote that while we

00:45:16,860 --> 00:45:21,900
are drupal specialists so and they

00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:23,790
contacted us because because you know we

00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:26,820
were truble but they actually came by

00:45:23,790 --> 00:45:28,620
way of other other tools that did not

00:45:26,820 --> 00:45:30,810
work well for them so they tried Moodle

00:45:28,620 --> 00:45:31,980
for example which has a lot of the

00:45:30,810 --> 00:45:34,260
learning management course where

00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:38,400
curriculum subject matter assessment

00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:40,020
knowledge assessment etc and it didn't

00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:42,870
work for them because it wasn't flexible

00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:45,270
extensible enough they tried I think

00:45:42,870 --> 00:45:46,860
there is some instance of a proprietary

00:45:45,270 --> 00:45:48,090
like a learning management system that

00:45:46,860 --> 00:45:50,250
they tried to write from the ground up

00:45:48,090 --> 00:45:51,810
and these questions that come up how do

00:45:50,250 --> 00:45:54,000
you interact with new hardware how do

00:45:51,810 --> 00:45:56,190
you how do you scale in case it gets big

00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:58,140
like how do you interact with users and

00:45:56,190 --> 00:45:59,670
you know and all these other questions

00:45:58,140 --> 00:46:02,790
at the Drupal community at large has

00:45:59,670 --> 00:46:04,230
managed to answer and I think I've you

00:46:02,790 --> 00:46:08,870
know I've been working with Drupal for a

00:46:04,230 --> 00:46:13,500
lot of years now I don't know 12 years

00:46:08,870 --> 00:46:15,180
and I've kind of gone through my my

00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:17,460
series of Drupal has to be used for all

00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:18,900
the things all the time always and now

00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:22,200
I'm kind of a little bit I'm a more

00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:24,030
mature and I do have a more realistic

00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:26,580
sense of places where it is not a good

00:46:24,030 --> 00:46:28,770
fit and a project like this I think it's

00:46:26,580 --> 00:46:32,070
definitely it is a good fit for all of

00:46:28,770 --> 00:46:34,370
the reasons it's easy to implement API

00:46:32,070 --> 00:46:37,620
is it's easy to manage and track data

00:46:34,370 --> 00:46:40,260
it's easy to throw together media

00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:42,270
management stuff for for developing

00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:49,400
curriculum so I think this isn't in

00:46:42,270 --> 00:46:49,400
particular good fit yeah

00:46:52,710 --> 00:47:06,370
yeah yeah so that's the last result in

00:46:59,710 --> 00:47:10,150
Troy command + or something oh there's a

00:47:06,370 --> 00:47:12,840
byword and the terminal session wasn't

00:47:10,150 --> 00:47:12,840
looking so good

00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:37,220
can you just cut to your terminal and

00:47:34,290 --> 00:47:37,220
resize that

00:47:43,550 --> 00:47:45,550
Oh

00:47:54,349 --> 00:48:00,660
that's as big as I can get it I'm afraid

00:47:58,220 --> 00:48:05,519
if you'd like to see it here welcome to

00:48:00,660 --> 00:48:14,130
come up and I can show you but yeah that

00:48:05,519 --> 00:48:16,740
lasts the dog that's one of the things

00:48:14,130 --> 00:48:18,569
inside the operation guide so this

00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:23,510
particular result was former he's good

00:48:18,569 --> 00:48:27,059
our demo my dogs are barking oh yeah

00:48:23,510 --> 00:48:30,740
yeah so there's just like this this

00:48:27,059 --> 00:48:35,569
stuff has information a map back to the

00:48:30,740 --> 00:48:37,740
question results for the quiz module

00:48:35,569 --> 00:48:40,349
trainer idea doesn't look like we're

00:48:37,740 --> 00:48:41,760
populating for this this guy but that

00:48:40,349 --> 00:48:44,579
would have information on which of these

00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:48,329
boxes or other trainer was was used

00:48:44,579 --> 00:48:51,210
start time elapsed time says success

00:48:48,329 --> 00:48:52,349
value the score basically and whether or

00:48:51,210 --> 00:48:55,349
not it's been closed and then the

00:48:52,349 --> 00:48:58,410
session data is just a blob of whatever

00:48:55,349 --> 00:49:00,869
error states occurred there many old 10

00:48:58,410 --> 00:49:02,700
stones yeah mostly all time stamp so

00:49:00,869 --> 00:49:04,680
there's some more device information

00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:06,210
this is basically the raw data that we

00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:10,019
also got some of this stuff out of and

00:49:06,210 --> 00:49:13,710
then there's time stamps with the sensor

00:49:10,019 --> 00:49:15,779
that was triggered in this case and when

00:49:13,710 --> 00:49:18,000
it was triggered and then there's a

00:49:15,779 --> 00:49:19,710
whole head in two separate fields or

00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:24,480
link this is that glove gooeyness won't

00:49:19,710 --> 00:49:27,630
fielder's separation agent this we end

00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:31,109
up parsing out on the results display so

00:49:27,630 --> 00:49:38,819
it's it's more to provide an overview of

00:49:31,109 --> 00:49:41,490
the session for instructor to SS but not

00:49:38,819 --> 00:49:43,289
something that we're really like I said

00:49:41,490 --> 00:49:45,420
we're not we don't really have a good

00:49:43,289 --> 00:49:48,660
way yet to we don't have a fully defined

00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:51,569
language to speak yeah and so as the

00:49:48,660 --> 00:49:53,759
project continues and more more trainers

00:49:51,569 --> 00:49:56,190
get developed the same group is also

00:49:53,759 --> 00:49:58,400
working on a project for a full body

00:49:56,190 --> 00:50:01,190
mannequin or modular mannequin so

00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:03,890
different heads and legs and torsos and

00:50:01,190 --> 00:50:09,290
and in components that can be assembled

00:50:03,890 --> 00:50:13,369
together to for instance recreate field

00:50:09,290 --> 00:50:15,140
trauma scenarios for army doctors so

00:50:13,369 --> 00:50:17,270
they can have they can configure the

00:50:15,140 --> 00:50:18,800
patient to have different things that

00:50:17,270 --> 00:50:24,859
are happening across the different

00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:27,319
modules that they have to address yeah

00:50:24,859 --> 00:50:29,780
both in different sensors for four

00:50:27,319 --> 00:50:31,160
different procedures so increasingly

00:50:29,780 --> 00:50:33,140
like having this common language between

00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:34,550
them i kinda interpret those results to

00:50:33,140 --> 00:50:41,000
become increasingly important as

00:50:34,550 --> 00:50:43,520
projects like that evo yeah yeah right

00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:45,980
now our entity type is pretty fixed like

00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:47,839
we don't like update it you know we

00:50:45,980 --> 00:50:50,990
don't don't update a particular entity

00:50:47,839 --> 00:50:56,780
very often if ever that just has the

00:50:50,990 --> 00:50:58,579
information about you know no actually

00:50:56,780 --> 00:51:01,310
not even just the information about the

00:50:58,579 --> 00:51:03,619
device itself and so it has like a

00:51:01,310 --> 00:51:05,180
little asset file to have JavaScript and

00:51:03,619 --> 00:51:08,210
stuff like that to tell how to launch

00:51:05,180 --> 00:51:13,460
the the Chrome application the actual

00:51:08,210 --> 00:51:20,240
results and stuff are matched with these

00:51:13,460 --> 00:51:23,200
question results so the devices

00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:23,200
themselves are kind of like

00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:31,700
so the information that gets uploaded to

00:51:29,780 --> 00:51:36,500
our our custom and any type is for

00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:39,320
configuring the devices contains some of

00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:42,530
these types of things so the time taken

00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:46,130
to complete the operation a maximum and

00:51:42,530 --> 00:51:49,130
minimum value the number of touch errors

00:51:46,130 --> 00:51:51,560
that are allowed to happen before you

00:51:49,130 --> 00:51:55,190
considered a failure the number of

00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:56,840
milliseconds of a touch before it's

00:51:55,190 --> 00:51:59,450
considered in error state so you can

00:51:56,840 --> 00:52:02,900
kind of like graze the sensor wall but

00:51:59,450 --> 00:52:07,700
if you really jab it then we're going to

00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:10,580
count that and we can handle some other

00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:14,240
just general device configuration to in

00:52:10,580 --> 00:52:15,740
this case this is for the the box that

00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:17,090
you saw in the video where you're

00:52:15,740 --> 00:52:19,100
turning lights on and off and you can

00:52:17,090 --> 00:52:21,350
configure the sequence you want them to

00:52:19,100 --> 00:52:27,010
light so that you have a consistent

00:52:21,350 --> 00:52:30,670
experience across multiple students yeah

00:52:27,010 --> 00:52:35,930
yeah in this particular configuration

00:52:30,670 --> 00:52:40,370
was set up for a big meeting of all of

00:52:35,930 --> 00:52:41,870
the orthopedic surgery board and they

00:52:40,370 --> 00:52:44,240
wanted to evaluate some different

00:52:41,870 --> 00:52:47,210
trainer devices and he actually set it

00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:49,400
up a little bit advanced they were

00:52:47,210 --> 00:52:53,570
switching their hands almost every

00:52:49,400 --> 00:53:01,160
single so it was it was kind of

00:52:53,570 --> 00:53:02,630
difficult but yeah that's mostly so

00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:07,240
there's a different different sequence

00:53:02,630 --> 00:53:07,240
of targets and then save yeah

00:53:28,410 --> 00:53:33,760
yeah so I think there's been some

00:53:31,570 --> 00:53:37,420
discussion about having the ability to

00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:39,940
randomly generate the sequence they do

00:53:37,420 --> 00:53:42,220
want it to be maintained its consistency

00:53:39,940 --> 00:53:46,000
though because for example when they

00:53:42,220 --> 00:53:49,990
enter into a study in the next couple of

00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:51,760
months they want student pays experience

00:53:49,990 --> 00:53:53,410
to more or less speed the same as

00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:54,910
student B is so they may set up

00:53:53,410 --> 00:53:57,250
different scenarios under different

00:53:54,910 --> 00:53:59,710
lessons but I don't think they want it

00:53:57,250 --> 00:54:01,300
to drastically change difficulty from

00:53:59,710 --> 00:54:13,810
one student to the next because it'll be

00:54:01,300 --> 00:54:17,109
harder to compare the result well we

00:54:13,810 --> 00:54:20,040
will keep the patches up to date I told

00:54:17,109 --> 00:54:20,040
thing is there's

00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:31,599
be a different student earned yeah you

00:54:28,959 --> 00:54:33,640
know I think we either have or are

00:54:31,599 --> 00:54:35,859
implementing more like authentication

00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:41,589
and so maybe some open ID stuff to keep

00:54:35,859 --> 00:54:46,229
that such a more consistent that would

00:54:41,589 --> 00:54:52,719
be trick you get a different kind of of

00:54:46,229 --> 00:54:54,160
pass/fail and I mean so the the general

00:54:52,719 --> 00:54:55,920
way that these will be used as I

00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:58,209
mentioned earlier and in some instances

00:54:55,920 --> 00:55:00,609
the students will take them home and

00:54:58,209 --> 00:55:02,170
they'll they'll be able to play with

00:55:00,609 --> 00:55:03,969
them on their own in which case they can

00:55:02,170 --> 00:55:05,499
pick the box up and look through the

00:55:03,969 --> 00:55:08,829
hole to poke the light instead of using

00:55:05,499 --> 00:55:12,749
the scope there's easier ways to cheat

00:55:08,829 --> 00:55:16,390
then then hacking the actual interface

00:55:12,749 --> 00:55:18,880
but when they actually come to a part of

00:55:16,390 --> 00:55:20,979
their assessment where there it's going

00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:23,439
to affect their score their ability to

00:55:20,979 --> 00:55:25,719
move forward they're going to be

00:55:23,439 --> 00:55:27,549
evaluated it's going to be in a learning

00:55:25,719 --> 00:55:29,499
environment with an instructor watching

00:55:27,549 --> 00:55:30,819
them perform the task so there's not

00:55:29,499 --> 00:55:34,299
going to be a lot of opportunity for

00:55:30,819 --> 00:55:36,969
that to occur and otherwise I mean these

00:55:34,299 --> 00:55:39,039
these students are just really there the

00:55:36,969 --> 00:55:41,259
purpose of these devices isn't really

00:55:39,039 --> 00:55:44,920
necessarily to completely teach them how

00:55:41,259 --> 00:55:47,400
to perform a surgery on a knee but to

00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:52,529
teach them sort of the manual skills of

00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:54,549
being able to use the scope to see in

00:55:52,529 --> 00:55:58,569
three-dimensional space where you can't

00:55:54,549 --> 00:56:01,599
actually see and manipulate different

00:55:58,569 --> 00:56:06,599
devices or the other the other box we

00:56:01,599 --> 00:56:11,019
didn't show is sort of a cross between

00:56:06,599 --> 00:56:15,279
operation and I don't know but it's the

00:56:11,019 --> 00:56:17,920
the task in that box is there are rows

00:56:15,279 --> 00:56:20,799
of sensors with caps over them and you

00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:23,410
have to move the cap from the sensor to

00:56:20,799 --> 00:56:25,329
a staging area and then switch your

00:56:23,410 --> 00:56:28,179
hands and then move it back to another

00:56:25,329 --> 00:56:29,799
sensor and then move it back down to the

00:56:28,179 --> 00:56:34,509
staging and move it back to its original

00:56:29,799 --> 00:56:36,459
position so you're not just looking

00:56:34,509 --> 00:56:37,190
around but you're manipulating objects

00:56:36,459 --> 00:56:42,710
and moving them

00:56:37,190 --> 00:56:44,060
with with the pincers and stuff I don't

00:56:42,710 --> 00:56:45,980
know if that completely answers your

00:56:44,060 --> 00:56:47,450
question but there is some security

00:56:45,980 --> 00:56:51,020
built into I mean all the students have

00:56:47,450 --> 00:56:53,540
to login I'm not I don't recall exactly

00:56:51,020 --> 00:56:56,950
what we're doing inside of any rest

00:56:53,540 --> 00:57:01,010
requests for like additional

00:56:56,950 --> 00:57:08,960
identification beyond just IDs of the

00:57:01,010 --> 00:57:10,790
session but right yes I said yeah you

00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:18,650
still have that subjective assessment as

00:57:10,790 --> 00:57:20,150
well so um we could yeah we were

00:57:18,650 --> 00:57:22,670
thinking of it we haven't scheduled one

00:57:20,150 --> 00:57:28,339
yet if there's interest we can

00:57:22,670 --> 00:57:30,800
definitely set one up yeah okay we've

00:57:28,339 --> 00:57:34,790
got two minutes left you guys have any

00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:37,910
other questions not you can go make

00:57:34,790 --> 00:57:39,589
wonderful use of two minutes if you want

00:57:37,910 --> 00:57:44,349
to come up and take a look at the actual

00:57:39,589 --> 00:57:44,349
