yeah so thanks coming along we are

00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:07,529
camera that's me I'm a solutions

00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:09,870
architect based out of the UK a week for

00:00:07,529 --> 00:00:11,639
a queer for about four years now being a

00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:14,009
solutions architect means that I kind of

00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:15,960
bridge the commercial and technical side

00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:17,490
of what we do and so I talk to people

00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,980
who are interested in using drift

00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:21,300
Lynette clear products and I convince

00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:23,730
them that we can do what they need to do

00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:25,590
and remove any technical blockers with

00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:27,539
me I've got will eisner who's a senior

00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:31,949
director for products so you want to

00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:35,550
describe what you do will I'm a product

00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:45,000
manager for my job is to help build the

00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:47,430
Acquia cloud platform and sure okay so

00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,780
just to put into context what equity

00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:50,370
does I wanted to kind of talk a little

00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:52,260
bit about our vision so we're always

00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:53,579
tweaking this and working on new ways to

00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:56,070
think of ourselves but it's useful to

00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:58,410
have kind of a North Star to attach

00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:59,699
ourselves to so I think at the moment

00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:01,890
we're talking about making it possible

00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:03,660
for dreamers and doers to craft the

00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:05,700
digital world which is a little fluffy

00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:07,560
but I think we can all be kind of

00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:09,000
confident that we're all dreamers to

00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:12,150
some extent or another we all kind of

00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,729
believe and the possibilities but the

00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:16,259
doing of it is what takes up all the

00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:18,210
time right so we want to try and take as

00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:19,860
much of the boring stuff out of the

00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:24,750
doing and make the dreaming a little bit

00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:27,960
more easy and to do that we want to

00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:30,930
deliver a universal platform for that

00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:33,479
and the universal platform means in

00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:35,610
context like a subscription element

00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:37,290
where we provide a bunch of services

00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:40,829
that you can rely on we don't lock you

00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:42,240
into anything data or we don't lock up

00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:44,430
your data we don't lock up your code

00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,869
that's all in supportive open source we

00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:48,540
really believe that and there is a

00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:50,310
company we want to create proud of but

00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:54,600
platform the way it's a lot easier a lot

00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:56,759
more reliable but a platform kind of

00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:59,640
means different things to different

00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:01,170
people in a digital project means

00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:04,020
different things to different people in

00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:06,630
all of these people have a stake and in

00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:08,729
that and they have a lot of work to do

00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:10,429
and they rely on a lot of tools and

00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:14,060
technologies to do it

00:02:10,429 --> 00:02:17,989
so you know it's tempting at a drupalcon

00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:19,549
to think of it as just a developer but

00:02:17,989 --> 00:02:21,260
and that's my background so that's often

00:02:19,549 --> 00:02:23,299
how I think of things but obviously the

00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:24,709
business owner wants it to do what they

00:02:23,299 --> 00:02:25,879
need to do the digital platform owner

00:02:24,709 --> 00:02:27,799
has a whole different set of

00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:29,090
responsibilities and often the things

00:02:27,799 --> 00:02:31,519
that these people need to do camp

00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:33,590
actually being conflict and what we've

00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:35,060
seen over you know lots and lots and

00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:37,159
lots of sight builds for lots and lots

00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:38,719
of customers is that we see the same

00:02:37,159 --> 00:02:40,909
things happening and when we see an

00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:44,150
opportunity to kind of ease some of the

00:02:40,909 --> 00:02:45,919
friction in that cycle we will create a

00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:47,930
product that that helps to do that and

00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:51,889
that's what we'll is responsible for

00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:53,780
bringing to market these are the

00:02:51,889 --> 00:02:56,269
personas that we use when we think about

00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:58,689
the products that we we have and so all

00:02:56,269 --> 00:03:01,730
kind of refer to these as we go through

00:02:58,689 --> 00:03:03,829
obviously their personas in a real world

00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:05,750
there's a lot more people than just for

00:03:03,829 --> 00:03:06,829
in a team and you know if you think of

00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:08,150
Drupal you could argue that there's

00:03:06,829 --> 00:03:10,730
thousands and thousands of people that

00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:12,079
are contributing to a site build so we

00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:14,540
want to plug in where it makes sense to

00:03:12,079 --> 00:03:15,919
those people and we obviously we indeed

00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:17,659
to the community for a lot of what they

00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:19,579
provide to us but we try to put give

00:03:17,659 --> 00:03:21,139
back as much as we can so some of the

00:03:19,579 --> 00:03:23,329
stuff i'll talk about as well as like

00:03:21,139 --> 00:03:27,439
it's open source and stuff that we

00:03:23,329 --> 00:03:31,060
contribute back into the community so

00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:34,310
this is how we see a digital life cycle

00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:37,159
this year it's always evolving it's an

00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:39,680
iterative process it's something that

00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:42,079
kind of never ends so you'll have an

00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,970
idea you'll need to create some pumpkin

00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:45,859
around that idea you'll create that put

00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:47,479
it out into the market I need to

00:03:45,859 --> 00:03:49,370
orchestrate how that data gets in front

00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:52,009
of people you need to analyze what's

00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:53,629
working what's not working hopefully you

00:03:52,009 --> 00:03:54,680
can build up a profile of who's visiting

00:03:53,629 --> 00:03:57,530
your site and then enrich your

00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:59,419
experience and so you know we've got

00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:01,849
products that sit against those so what

00:03:59,419 --> 00:04:03,049
I'm going to talk about today some of

00:04:01,849 --> 00:04:05,030
these logos might be a bit mysterious

00:04:03,049 --> 00:04:07,549
without text below them but broadly

00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:10,939
we've got a clear cloud Drupal 8 and

00:04:07,549 --> 00:04:14,500
lightning content hub left and some

00:04:10,939 --> 00:04:14,500
other bits and pieces that fit into that

00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:20,779
so there's a lot there and necessarily

00:04:18,259 --> 00:04:21,579
will be kind of whipping through this is

00:04:20,779 --> 00:04:23,259
that

00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:26,560
trinity college library if you haven't

00:04:23,259 --> 00:04:27,699
been that's really amazing but yeah

00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,740
we're going to try and get through quite

00:04:27,699 --> 00:04:31,479
a lot of a lot of our products and

00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:33,550
because of that we won't be able to go

00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:34,840
into a huge amount of detail but if

00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:37,990
there's anything that you are

00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:39,550
particularly interested in you can swing

00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:41,409
by the booth will find one of us or

00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:43,539
anyone wearing it wish you and we can

00:04:41,409 --> 00:04:44,979
either help you out there and then or we

00:04:43,539 --> 00:04:50,740
can put you in touch with someone who

00:04:44,979 --> 00:04:54,520
can go into more detail so this is how

00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:57,610
we kind of categorize our our platform

00:04:54,520 --> 00:05:00,039
and what it means in terms of practical

00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:01,180
tools that you can use so along the top

00:05:00,039 --> 00:05:02,800
there you can see the kind of channels

00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:05,469
that end up being part of a digital

00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:08,500
program these are always changing and

00:05:05,469 --> 00:05:11,139
adapting you know something that's come

00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:13,690
out reasonably recently as being having

00:05:11,139 --> 00:05:15,789
a lot of momentum is voice control so it

00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:18,279
was on echo Surrey and lots of other

00:05:15,789 --> 00:05:19,509
things like that but there's all sorts

00:05:18,279 --> 00:05:22,090
of things traditional web of course

00:05:19,509 --> 00:05:25,060
phone chat mobile and on and on it goes

00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:26,919
I guess the common thread that brings

00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:29,949
all those together as having an open and

00:05:26,919 --> 00:05:32,590
robust API so everything we do we're

00:05:29,949 --> 00:05:35,229
trying to push around VAR api and we

00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:39,370
hope to be soon totally api first on

00:05:35,229 --> 00:05:42,639
everything we do there is so kind of at

00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:44,949
the base of that is cloud so we go into

00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:47,379
more detail on that too but you know

00:05:44,949 --> 00:05:49,719
people want that to be secure performant

00:05:47,379 --> 00:05:52,870
elastic so if you have a big spike you

00:05:49,719 --> 00:05:54,129
so I can grow to cope with that but

00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:55,539
there's also a lot of management that

00:05:54,129 --> 00:05:57,520
goes with that and there's management

00:05:55,539 --> 00:05:59,440
from a technical level but also you know

00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:01,750
commercial we spoke about those personas

00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:04,060
before the digital platform owner how do

00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:05,680
you handle managing thousands and

00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:08,020
thousands of sites or hundreds or tens

00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,460
it gets really complicated really

00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:12,460
quickly so we're trying to provide some

00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:16,240
tools their experience assembly is kind

00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:17,710
of a fancy way to say CMS Drupal and

00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:21,099
lightning and some tools that plug into

00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:22,990
that and we'll talk about that the bits

00:06:21,099 --> 00:06:25,990
on the top are Connor the services that

00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:28,990
can sit on top of Drupal and provide a

00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:31,149
little bit more value so Universal

00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:33,400
content is about getting your content to

00:06:31,149 --> 00:06:36,310
the right device at the right time

00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:38,650
and from any source so any source any

00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:40,630
destination contextual interactions

00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:42,639
about making sure that when either to

00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:44,050
the site that's right for me when will

00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:46,449
visit the site that's right for him and

00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:48,940
so on a song and that's challenging to

00:06:46,449 --> 00:06:50,320
do it scale I think Jeff was starkly

00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:52,210
been really good at that but doing it

00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:54,580
for every single visitor to your site

00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:57,220
and making sure that things work is a

00:06:54,580 --> 00:07:00,190
real challenge that we're facing every

00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:03,070
day and that's where those products for

00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:07,479
them so I'm going to start talking about

00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:12,300
them one by one now so I guess we we

00:07:07,479 --> 00:07:14,380
start now is that clear lightning so

00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:16,960
equivalent came out of a project that I

00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:18,699
actually my team Ram we would give demos

00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:21,190
to clients who are interested in Drupal

00:07:18,699 --> 00:07:22,630
for a long time and we realized that we

00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:24,970
were just doing the same work over and

00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:27,340
over and over again so we thought hey

00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:29,199
why don't we create a distribution or a

00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:30,550
package version of Drupal that has a lot

00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:32,500
of those features in one place so

00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:34,289
instead of starting from scratch we

00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:36,729
start with a kind of head start and that

00:07:34,289 --> 00:07:38,639
works well and it's all worked well but

00:07:36,729 --> 00:07:41,530
then what we begin to realize is that

00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:43,810
there's a way that we could do that not

00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:46,690
just for the demos but also for actual

00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:48,220
sites that are being deployed something

00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:49,479
they actually tended to hear a little

00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:50,919
bit was I always sort of those cool

00:07:49,479 --> 00:07:52,720
stuff in the demo but it didn't end up

00:07:50,919 --> 00:07:55,090
in there in our life site and we thought

00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:57,970
hey that's doesn't sound right so we

00:07:55,090 --> 00:08:00,190
took a lot of what we did demos and we

00:07:57,970 --> 00:08:04,090
packaged it up we use the release of

00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:06,099
Drupal 8 is a great opportunity to to

00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:09,789
sort of reset how we do that and start

00:08:06,099 --> 00:08:12,699
from a greenfield to build a whole bunch

00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:14,830
of features into lightning so if you

00:08:12,699 --> 00:08:17,139
were to go to lightning dock we're calm

00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:18,460
or droopy doggin grave lightning you

00:08:17,139 --> 00:08:20,050
would get a package version of Drupal 8

00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:21,460
but it was already set up and configured

00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:24,400
with all these kinds of things layout

00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:26,440
workflow previewing media security

00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:31,479
integrations and testing and lots of

00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:34,180
other things besides it's totally open

00:08:31,479 --> 00:08:35,589
source now developed in the open and one

00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:37,800
of the nice things if you've been we're

00:08:35,589 --> 00:08:40,060
hendra cool for a while and used

00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:42,520
distributions you may have had the

00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:44,410
experience where the distribution or

00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:46,240
move on and be upgraded of vision and

00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:46,779
getting from the vision you've got to

00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,639
the next revision

00:08:46,779 --> 00:08:50,499
can be really challenging we've

00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:52,810
committed with lightning that we will

00:08:50,499 --> 00:08:54,100
maintain security and functionality

00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:56,350
updates that will be compatible when

00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:58,720
have an upgrade path so if you start a

00:08:56,350 --> 00:09:00,790
site build on lightning today on Drupal

00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,439
8.1 and then a few months down the line

00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:03,639
dripping wet point2 is got ahold of new

00:09:02,439 --> 00:09:05,379
stuff there will be a way to do that

00:09:03,639 --> 00:09:07,569
with lightning which will all be managed

00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:14,110
by us and supported by us and will be

00:09:07,569 --> 00:09:15,069
open sores excuse me so if you've been

00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:16,509
around Drupal for a while you'll

00:09:15,069 --> 00:09:19,120
probably be familiar with us what's

00:09:16,509 --> 00:09:21,309
going to we're going to see where you

00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,949
would start you do a site you base it on

00:09:21,309 --> 00:09:25,180
Drupal everything's fine it works you

00:09:23,949 --> 00:09:27,670
install a few modules different

00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:30,670
configurations run some themes looks

00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:33,370
okay but then you have to do two or

00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:35,769
three or five or ten more sites so you

00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:38,559
think hey I'm going to create my own

00:09:35,769 --> 00:09:40,089
distribution when version of Drupal that

00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:41,889
does all the things that we needed to do

00:09:40,089 --> 00:09:43,809
and I'm going to maintain that but

00:09:41,889 --> 00:09:45,100
clearly there's you know some effort and

00:09:43,809 --> 00:09:46,629
building that in the first place and

00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:48,730
then there's some effort and maintaining

00:09:46,629 --> 00:09:50,230
it on an ongoing basis which is

00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:53,199
additional to what you have to do to

00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:54,759
manage the actual sites day-to-day so

00:09:53,199 --> 00:09:56,079
what we figure is that and a lot of

00:09:54,759 --> 00:09:58,269
cases you'll be able to take lightning

00:09:56,079 --> 00:10:00,459
and remove a lot of that headache so you

00:09:58,269 --> 00:10:01,629
can still have this the you know all the

00:10:00,459 --> 00:10:02,769
stuff that's in Drupal core you can

00:10:01,629 --> 00:10:04,750
still manage your sights on an

00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:06,399
individual basis but you can use

00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:07,750
lightning to provide a lot of that base

00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:11,680
functionality that you would otherwise

00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:13,660
have to assemble yourself and triple

00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:16,930
being Drupal you can put your own

00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:18,970
customizations on the top so Drupal if

00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:21,220
you're new to it has been developed in

00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:22,809
the open for like 16 years now and it's

00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:25,449
good at being modular it's good at using

00:10:22,809 --> 00:10:27,970
code from different places so lightnings

00:10:25,449 --> 00:10:29,559
we are aware of that and designed with

00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:31,689
the notion and mind that people are

00:10:29,559 --> 00:10:34,000
going to want to make changes and EDD

00:10:31,689 --> 00:10:35,319
plugins so that you can continue to use

00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,819
lightning and hear all the updates but

00:10:35,319 --> 00:10:41,620
also have your custom stuff and your

00:10:36,819 --> 00:10:46,749
sites and they can all coexist that's

00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:49,029
lightning and that's fine and it's all

00:10:46,749 --> 00:10:51,249
very conceptual but actually getting it

00:10:49,029 --> 00:10:53,069
from you know running on your laptop to

00:10:51,249 --> 00:10:55,420
running it live is a whole other story

00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:57,410
especially when you're running lots and

00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:59,990
lots and lots of sites that

00:10:57,410 --> 00:11:01,490
becomes much more of a challenge and you

00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:02,990
know we see customers again and again

00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:04,790
that will have not only lots of sites

00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:06,680
but they'll have lots of teams they

00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:08,690
might have different agencies and

00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:09,829
different locations they've got

00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:11,750
different people they want to give

00:11:09,829 --> 00:11:15,829
certain levels of access to the code and

00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:17,540
some they don't and so on so again we

00:11:15,829 --> 00:11:20,899
saw the need and we came up with this

00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:25,100
thing will the building launch tool will

00:11:20,899 --> 00:11:27,740
be LT for short so that's an equable

00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:30,470
tool it's all there the creating new

00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:32,779
projects from a template with a lot of

00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:34,459
in much the same way that lightning is

00:11:32,779 --> 00:11:37,160
constructed with some out-of-the-box

00:11:34,459 --> 00:11:39,860
ideas and best practices that are baked

00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:42,189
into the structure so that might not

00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:44,300
mean a lot when you see it there but

00:11:42,189 --> 00:11:46,189
when you think about all the things that

00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:48,560
you kind of need to configure and get

00:11:46,189 --> 00:11:51,050
right to get a project going that's

00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:52,879
being complex of may need different

00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:55,459
things for different sites and different

00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:58,370
teams there's a lot to configure so the

00:11:55,459 --> 00:12:00,649
idea is that you create a project you

00:11:58,370 --> 00:12:03,050
define what your base version of Drupal

00:12:00,649 --> 00:12:08,329
is you define your tests your

00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:09,920
documentation you know your configs how

00:12:08,329 --> 00:12:11,889
the code is structured what happens on

00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:14,779
site a or site being when it's deployed

00:12:11,889 --> 00:12:16,850
what happens in div what happens in prod

00:12:14,779 --> 00:12:18,680
what happens when you commit to get and

00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:21,079
so on and so on all of that stuff has

00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:23,089
kind of been worked out in structured in

00:12:21,079 --> 00:12:24,889
a way that with a few of the scripts and

00:12:23,089 --> 00:12:27,290
tools that we provide you will be able

00:12:24,889 --> 00:12:28,759
to set that up and kind of reduce the

00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:31,279
maintenance headache of maintaining that

00:12:28,759 --> 00:12:33,680
this is something that you know a

00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:35,269
development manager or a build engineer

00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:37,279
could spend their whole week month year

00:12:35,269 --> 00:12:40,459
doing we're trying to kind of take some

00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:43,339
of that off the plate again this is an

00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:44,750
open source project it's got to get hub

00:12:43,339 --> 00:12:47,779
and fool around with it it's all quite

00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:52,370
well-documented and it's an ongoing

00:12:47,779 --> 00:12:54,559
basis on an ongoing basis so this is an

00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:57,740
example of someone setting up a new

00:12:54,559 --> 00:13:02,120
project based on on both will be LT so

00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:05,540
you just define a few configs you know

00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:08,809
he will send up some names some install

00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:11,160
profiles in this case lightning some

00:13:08,809 --> 00:13:13,790
upstream vision control

00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:16,980
set which versions of modules or

00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:20,310
distributions you want to use database

00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:21,750
connections once that's all set up you

00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:24,930
can just run a script and it will start

00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:28,680
to build an archive for or an attribute

00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:29,639
for for development and testing so if

00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:32,220
you're you know if you're a developer

00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:35,610
any is using composer or site install

00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:37,500
scripts this will be not unfamiliar to

00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:39,689
you we're just trying to do it in a way

00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:41,490
that incorporates not only Drupal best

00:13:39,689 --> 00:13:44,220
practices but also around testing and

00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:48,209
documentation and so on I think you

00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:51,000
should run on install and you'll see

00:13:48,209 --> 00:13:52,589
them login and so there's a this is kind

00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,579
of the use case of someone doing it on

00:13:52,589 --> 00:13:57,959
their local machine for development and

00:13:55,579 --> 00:13:59,730
that's you know typically if you're new

00:13:57,959 --> 00:14:00,959
to Drupal that's how a development works

00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:02,759
like people will have a vision running

00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:04,620
on their local machine and then they'll

00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:07,230
deploy into an integration environment

00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:10,889
to do you know no systems integration

00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:14,120
testing or QA or whatever and that's

00:14:10,889 --> 00:14:16,199
that so yeah there might not be that

00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:17,660
revelatory to you if you've kind of done

00:14:16,199 --> 00:14:19,970
this sort of thing before but I think

00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:23,160
what we're basically seeing is that

00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:24,420
we've kind of formalized a lot of the

00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:27,149
knowledge that we were seeing again and

00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:29,160
again on our own projects and we think

00:14:27,149 --> 00:14:30,540
it's made a difference right so we've

00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:33,180
got a big professional services team

00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:35,819
there hundred percent years blt on every

00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:38,910
single project it's like four weeks of

00:14:35,819 --> 00:14:40,980
developer time saved per project means

00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:42,689
that all of our projects have testing

00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:45,269
which wasn't necessarily the case before

00:14:42,689 --> 00:14:47,430
that means that any custom code book

00:14:45,269 --> 00:14:49,980
brought into the into the distribution

00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:51,600
or that or the deployment is compliant

00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:53,939
with your coding standards which implies

00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,470
that it's probably more secure it's easy

00:14:53,939 --> 00:14:58,680
to read it'll be easy to upgrade in the

00:14:55,470 --> 00:15:01,380
future and so on and we also bacon some

00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:02,550
some best practice around you can't

00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:04,439
deploy a module that's got known

00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:05,790
security problems and so on and there's

00:15:04,439 --> 00:15:07,910
a whole lot of other stuff going on but

00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:10,110
I think the kind of takeaway is that

00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:12,089
once you get your head around it it does

00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:14,220
tend to save a lot of time especially

00:15:12,089 --> 00:15:17,670
for those repetitive tasks that need set

00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:19,680
up on every project we've got a bunch of

00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:21,689
internal testimonials from people saying

00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,600
that they don't get failures and

00:15:21,689 --> 00:15:30,759
deployment which is

00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:32,350
if a nightmare it can be much less of a

00:15:30,759 --> 00:15:35,139
benefit like a pro think that overhead

00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:37,420
of doing it might not be with it it's

00:15:35,139 --> 00:15:38,860
also not the you know if you've already

00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:40,329
got an existing project it doesn't make

00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:42,009
a huge amount of sense to retrofit it

00:15:40,329 --> 00:15:44,889
into this but it's well worth looking

00:15:42,009 --> 00:15:46,709
into it does have a few things set up

00:15:44,889 --> 00:15:48,759
like a food planning to use thing around

00:15:46,709 --> 00:15:59,560
phpunit a lot of that stuff's kind of

00:15:48,759 --> 00:16:01,180
already dear so yeah yeah I mean we we

00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:03,130
do use it on every project so that

00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:06,100
includes projects or a single site but

00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:08,399
yeah I think it's a less useful still

00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:12,759
useful but less useful with just one

00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:14,319
yeah yeah so you saw all that stuff that

00:16:12,759 --> 00:16:18,940
that developer was typing into his

00:16:14,319 --> 00:16:21,060
console here and you know what what

00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:24,579
we're seeing emerging a lot is that

00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:26,800
especially in Drupal 8 land projects are

00:16:24,579 --> 00:16:29,410
built from a set of definitions that but

00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:31,149
with composer they're not as simple as

00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:35,079
they used to be they incorporate a lot

00:16:31,149 --> 00:16:37,060
of tools and a lot of those tools make a

00:16:35,079 --> 00:16:38,740
massive amount of sense of development

00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:40,660
but they don't make so much sense when

00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:42,730
you push out to production this is much

00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:44,589
more so in Drupal 8 minute even triple

00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:47,880
seven and so there's a really good blog

00:16:44,589 --> 00:16:50,230
post actually by Michelle crazy about

00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:51,759
the deployment you know production is

00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:53,560
actually just an artifact of development

00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:55,750
your development can be thought of as

00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:58,180
like a factory and then your production

00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:59,199
is like the finished product and so we

00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:00,730
don't want everything that's in the

00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:02,170
factory out on the street you know

00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:06,189
there's a lot of things that don't make

00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:07,809
any sense and a typical not even not

00:17:06,189 --> 00:17:09,159
even a complex project will use all of

00:17:07,809 --> 00:17:11,530
these kinds of things so there'll be

00:17:09,159 --> 00:17:13,600
some CSS preprocessors and frameworks

00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:15,880
that weak-ass runners with grunt you

00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,990
know there's probably a get horrible but

00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:20,220
bucket or something like that that's

00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:22,600
managing pull requests the needs code

00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:24,730
checking with code module there's be hit

00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:27,339
test as PHP units as composer and so on

00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:30,730
and so on all of that stuff is cool but

00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:32,669
in reality once we go to production we

00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:34,780
just want our site to be to pull it out

00:17:32,669 --> 00:17:39,370
to our hosting

00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:40,840
hopefully that clear cloud and there's a

00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:42,940
lot of tools in there right so i won't

00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:44,950
go through these in detail but in a

00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:47,830
typical sprint cycle you know there's

00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:49,210
people using SAS people using a composer

00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:51,580
there's people isn't be here and so

00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:53,860
stuff i cover kind of before but this

00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:56,070
will happen at every deploy it might

00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:58,330
have been multiple times on a sprint

00:17:56,070 --> 00:18:00,490
getting all of those tool set up to do

00:17:58,330 --> 00:18:03,010
all of that stuff is kind of a task in

00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:06,250
itself and something to maintain so our

00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:08,020
idea is that we will have a managed

00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:10,590
service called equity pipelines that

00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:14,170
will run in the cloud you define a

00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:16,420
Gemmell file in your repository you

00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:17,800
deploy it up now we'll see it there if

00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:19,900
it's there will say okay we're going to

00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:21,190
run some build tasks will spin up a

00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:23,710
temporary environment that will do all

00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:25,390
of that for you so it'll run no tis to

00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:27,220
run all the JavaScript tasks you know

00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:29,590
duel the CSCS all the stuff we've just

00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:31,750
mentioned once it's passed all of the

00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:34,000
tests and all the codes in the right

00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:35,290
space will push it out to our dear stage

00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,360
real production environment whatever you

00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:39,430
have configured so that means that you

00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:41,140
don't deploy code that doesn't work

00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:43,600
we'll don't deploy code that's not up to

00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:46,150
standard that's the idea we're going to

00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:47,620
run it as a yeah as a service so we will

00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:51,430
maintain it in a way that makes sense

00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:53,290
for Drupal much in much the same way we

00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:54,820
have cloud is like a it's a Drupal

00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:57,490
runtime it's on a generic hosting

00:18:54,820 --> 00:19:01,330
environment it'll be tuned just for

00:18:57,490 --> 00:19:03,040
running Drupal projects it's actually in

00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:05,230
private beta at the moment it will be in

00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:10,360
public theater next quarter of this

00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:11,830
quarter i guess now in and generally

00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:14,290
available building next year so if

00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:15,610
you're interested in it come and find us

00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:20,620
and we can we can talk to you about

00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:23,740
getting you on to that ok so we're

00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:28,810
moving up the stack now heading into

00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:30,550
cloud site factory so yeah for those who

00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:32,620
don't know own think of speaking to some

00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:34,420
of you before you may know that we run

00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:36,130
what i like to call with drupal

00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:38,800
application runtime that sits on top of

00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:41,050
Amazon Web Services so it's a highly

00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:42,580
tuned highly available platform as a

00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:46,570
service that's designed just for running

00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:48,620
Drupal the idea is that you have your

00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:49,610
code and your content you bring us there

00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:52,460
and we handle all of the infrastructure

00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:56,860
issues around security performance

00:19:52,460 --> 00:20:00,110
availability and so on site factory

00:19:56,860 --> 00:20:02,030
extends that into moving from providing

00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:04,490
tools for hosting and managing of code

00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:06,650
into actually managing sites as a sort

00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:10,780
of logical unit so that you can run many

00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:13,040
sites across however many teams

00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:15,260
locations whatever however you organize

00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:16,970
yourself and you can have a dashboard

00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:19,010
that shows those you can govern them

00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:20,420
from a central place so you get a lot of

00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:22,309
the benefits that Drupal brings of

00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:23,450
multi-site but you get a sort of

00:20:22,309 --> 00:20:24,920
software-as-a-service tool that gives

00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:30,500
you clover heads up on what's actually

00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:32,090
going on at a site level cloud will save

00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:34,240
you a lot of effort because instead of

00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:37,670
having to maintain all of these things

00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:38,990
via managed hosting or by yourself we

00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:40,670
will handle it for you so we've got to

00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:42,590
do like dedicated operations team a

00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:45,110
dedicated cloud engineering team that's

00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:49,030
globally distributed who are monitoring

00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:53,120
echo cloud 24-7 actually running about

00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:55,400
14,000 instances in AWS or more and

00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:59,600
we've got really good start all that

00:20:55,400 --> 00:21:02,600
time yeah it's a highly available we

00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:07,429
have a lot of security certifications so

00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:09,340
you know PCI DSS ISO 27001 FedRAMP if

00:21:07,429 --> 00:21:11,390
you know we have to deal with it stuff

00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:14,240
you'll know a lot of those acronyms

00:21:11,390 --> 00:21:15,710
they're real pain to maintain but we

00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,450
handle it and it's really key to our

00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:18,860
business that we do so you can be

00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:20,150
guaranteed that if you deploy your code

00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:22,309
here you'll meet all of those standards

00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:28,760
which may be applicable to you all your

00:21:22,309 --> 00:21:30,470
clients requirements so I think one of

00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:32,300
the things that will show you today is

00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:34,550
kind of in line with what we've been

00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:35,990
talking about so far is the development

00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:39,020
tools that allow you to actually get

00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:42,260
your site out onto that platform so all

00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:44,860
customers get as a minimum development

00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:47,870
as staging in a production environment

00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:49,070
we really try to simplify the act of

00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:50,899
deployment

00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:54,409
developer you'll know that deployment

00:21:50,899 --> 00:21:56,630
can be really painful and if it's not

00:21:54,409 --> 00:22:01,159
reliable it can really introduce a lot

00:21:56,630 --> 00:22:03,950
of nasty bugs and issues and stress we

00:22:01,159 --> 00:22:05,450
also enable all of that stuff so you can

00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:07,009
do it in a web UI which is all

00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:08,450
permission managed and all that sort of

00:22:07,009 --> 00:22:10,700
stuff but you can also do it via an API

00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:13,039
so if you've got Jenkins or some other

00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:15,980
build system you can hook into it and

00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:18,309
run these kind of tasks remotely so you

00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:21,379
actually have to log in and click things

00:22:18,309 --> 00:22:23,720
this is an example of a typical use case

00:22:21,379 --> 00:22:24,830
where you might have finished your

00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:26,299
sprint and you're doing some sprint

00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:29,509
testing you want to grab the latest copy

00:22:26,299 --> 00:22:31,840
of the code so we're going to deploy the

00:22:29,509 --> 00:22:35,299
master branch to our staging environment

00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:37,009
give it a nice little message so that

00:22:35,299 --> 00:22:39,529
when someone checks the tag later on

00:22:37,009 --> 00:22:41,360
they'll know what was going on and then

00:22:39,529 --> 00:22:43,759
we're also going to pull down the code

00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,720
and the database from production so that

00:22:43,759 --> 00:22:47,120
we know we've got the latest

00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:50,000
configuration and content for our

00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:51,559
testing so as you can see it's just a

00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:55,399
case of dragging and dropping between

00:22:51,559 --> 00:22:57,590
environments and then all of those site

00:22:55,399 --> 00:23:00,620
components will be will pull in they'll

00:22:57,590 --> 00:23:04,309
be isolated duplicated and then you can

00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:07,970
do your testing so as I say all of the

00:23:04,309 --> 00:23:10,549
stuff is totally ap liable so if you do

00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:13,220
have your own tools and systems anything

00:23:10,549 --> 00:23:14,600
that you see here can be done varun API

00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:16,580
there's a whole lot of other stuff in

00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:18,350
there that i will show during on real

00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:20,419
time log streaming around automatic

00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:22,909
backups are doing so fired rush or the

00:23:20,419 --> 00:23:31,039
shell but that's kind of at the core of

00:23:22,909 --> 00:23:33,019
the development tools so in that example

00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:34,519
i was running in the cloud so you have a

00:23:33,019 --> 00:23:37,129
dedicated d of stage and production

00:23:34,519 --> 00:23:39,259
environment it's sort of typical day to

00:23:37,129 --> 00:23:40,879
day which flow would be you do your own

00:23:39,259 --> 00:23:42,649
code on your own machine whatever you

00:23:40,879 --> 00:23:43,669
like whatever you prefer and then you

00:23:42,649 --> 00:23:45,019
start to integrate with the other

00:23:43,669 --> 00:23:47,860
people's code on the development or

00:23:45,019 --> 00:23:47,860
staging environments

00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:58,350
so we we have a all-in-one product

00:23:56,370 --> 00:24:02,100
called Acquia dev desktop which is a

00:23:58,350 --> 00:24:04,169
like a man pure wamp environment which

00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:05,520
you can log into your equity account and

00:24:04,169 --> 00:24:06,450
will pull down all of the sites that you

00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,730
have so that you can work on them

00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:09,750
locally and that's you know it's a

00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:12,750
really good way to get started quickly

00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:14,669
especially if you're newer to that a lot

00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:17,070
of people quite opinionated like myself

00:24:14,669 --> 00:24:18,299
about the local environment so you don't

00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:19,409
have to do it that way if you want to do

00:24:18,299 --> 00:24:21,690
it you're anyway it's fine but we do

00:24:19,409 --> 00:24:23,250
have the tools that we support their

00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:24,929
free anyone can use them regardless of

00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:26,700
whether a net clear customer or not and

00:24:24,929 --> 00:24:28,380
they're really well integrated so yeah

00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:33,210
so an answer is yes we could do

00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:36,659
something local so site fit very is

00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:39,600
built on top of cloud but it changes

00:24:36,659 --> 00:24:42,330
kind of the notion from managing code to

00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:43,950
managing sites so before we were

00:24:42,330 --> 00:24:47,070
strictly dealing with databases and

00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:48,659
files in vision control what this means

00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:51,539
is that instead of that you are minting

00:24:48,659 --> 00:24:53,640
at a site level so if you're familiar

00:24:51,539 --> 00:24:54,929
with Drupal you may know about the

00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:56,730
concept of multi site where you have a

00:24:54,929 --> 00:24:58,799
single code base that can run one too

00:24:56,730 --> 00:25:02,940
many sites and it kind of alluded to

00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:05,580
that earlier we can also via this

00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:08,100
interface run across multiple code bases

00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:11,279
or multiple geographies so sort of show

00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:13,799
you what it means and practice this is

00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:16,289
kind of a dashboard where you could see

00:25:13,799 --> 00:25:19,320
a whole lot of sites that are deployed

00:25:16,289 --> 00:25:21,659
in life for each of the sites i can log

00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:23,600
in i have a centralized login mechanism

00:25:21,659 --> 00:25:26,340
i can do things like back them up or

00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:29,580
clear caches things like that i can

00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:33,390
filter on how busy they are what the

00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:35,640
domain is a whole bunch other things and

00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:36,779
i can arrange sites into groups because

00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:38,909
there's a whole lot of groups along the

00:25:36,779 --> 00:25:40,890
left and you can control access to those

00:25:38,909 --> 00:25:42,570
groups on a very fine grain level so you

00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:46,340
know as an edmund ice can't see

00:25:42,570 --> 00:25:46,340
everything but you might not want them

00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:53,610
have to hear for this interface yes this

00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:57,360
is slight factory that we're looking at

00:25:53,610 --> 00:26:00,240
the underlying kind of guts that makes

00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:02,250
Drupal run many sites is not as native

00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:05,309
to Drupal but to have this year this is

00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:08,370
this is a site factory capability you

00:26:05,309 --> 00:26:10,710
can see there i've just i've just

00:26:08,370 --> 00:26:12,900
created a new site and so it's as simple

00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:14,580
as that so i can go in as it as an

00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:17,070
administrator i can click a few buttons

00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:19,860
chooser you know the distribution i want

00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:21,510
to use the location or the hosting

00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:24,900
cluster that I want to use give it a

00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:28,559
name give it a domain click go and then

00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:30,539
the site will be built and see there in

00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:33,630
my little group we've got our new site

00:26:30,539 --> 00:26:35,130
the site's been built and eagle-eyed

00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:36,539
might have seen that I chose the minimal

00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:38,640
and still profile which was kind of the

00:26:36,539 --> 00:26:42,000
minimum that drip will allow you to do

00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:44,429
and there's my site you can see also

00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,980
that my account on the site factory is

00:26:44,429 --> 00:26:48,780
actually been federated out to the

00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:50,429
destination site so i don't need to

00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:53,250
maintain a login for every single site

00:26:50,429 --> 00:26:54,630
in my network as an administrator I'll

00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:56,370
automatically get created as an

00:26:54,630 --> 00:27:05,370
administrator and I can just have single

00:26:56,370 --> 00:27:10,110
sign-on across the whole group so we

00:27:05,370 --> 00:27:11,940
have a central git repository and so

00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:13,770
basically we're talking so each site

00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:15,299
will have the way that the code is

00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:16,650
structured so that certain parts of the

00:27:15,299 --> 00:27:18,179
code will be applicable to certain sites

00:27:16,650 --> 00:27:21,179
but underline there is a single

00:27:18,179 --> 00:27:25,740
repository with stacks there's a single

00:27:21,179 --> 00:27:28,830
repo is it multiple Reapers okay yeah so

00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:30,330
we have this a optional functionality of

00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:33,419
which we call stacks which is we you

00:27:30,330 --> 00:27:35,100
might want to have multiple repositories

00:27:33,419 --> 00:27:36,750
because you've got sites that do very

00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:38,880
different things and then you will get

00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:40,559
one per stack so it's not Pierce it-it's

00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:44,419
bit of steak we can talk about it and

00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:44,419
lots of detail if you find me afterward

00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:53,270
we've got a lot of clients so the one

00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:57,600
that we talk about a lot is Pfizer

00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:59,870
veolia warner music group some other

00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,870
good ones

00:28:09,389 --> 00:28:26,769
yeah yeah I think it probably skews a

00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:28,120
little bit more towards kind of

00:28:26,769 --> 00:28:30,490
marketing sites it a little bit more

00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:32,710
static obviously they've got editors in

00:28:30,490 --> 00:28:35,139
you know did see Miss driven they're not

00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:37,269
literally static sites but I think in

00:28:35,139 --> 00:28:41,139
general it's tends to where people have

00:28:37,269 --> 00:28:44,139
a lot of more simple sites there's no

00:28:41,139 --> 00:28:45,429
limitation there you know it's a full

00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:47,169
install of Drupal we've recites

00:28:45,429 --> 00:28:48,610
completely affluence toward rific do

00:28:47,169 --> 00:28:51,249
whatever you like but I think just and

00:28:48,610 --> 00:28:52,809
practice the overhead of the mental

00:28:51,249 --> 00:28:55,720
overhead of managing a lot of complex

00:28:52,809 --> 00:28:57,970
sites usually means that they get broken

00:28:55,720 --> 00:29:00,429
out into their own into their own

00:28:57,970 --> 00:29:02,679
environment I think yeah one of the

00:29:00,429 --> 00:29:04,480
great example actually of consumer

00:29:02,679 --> 00:29:07,299
packaged goods is a really good one

00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:09,610
because those companies will have like

00:29:07,299 --> 00:29:12,220
20 brands say and those 20 brands might

00:29:09,610 --> 00:29:14,200
be deployed into 20 countries so that's

00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:17,470
you know it might be four hundred sites

00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:19,990
/ brand well you know what 400 sites

00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:22,029
total sorry how do you manage that you

00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:23,499
know how do you handle that when you

00:29:22,029 --> 00:29:24,970
want to keep consistency and not have to

00:29:23,499 --> 00:29:28,149
pay for a site four hundred times over

00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:29,350
so we've got mislaid does that you say

00:29:28,149 --> 00:29:31,149
be mellowed some of the biggest bruise

00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:32,799
in the world it's a really good use case

00:29:31,149 --> 00:29:34,659
when you need to deploy into lots of

00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:40,809
regions and lots of languages which

00:29:34,659 --> 00:29:42,549
looks really rough so moving up again so

00:29:40,809 --> 00:29:45,580
assuming that you've got all your sites

00:29:42,549 --> 00:29:47,440
now deployed and running and you need to

00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:49,440
start moving container amber between

00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:51,700
them so that stuff doesn't get sold away

00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:54,940
so we talked about this generally as the

00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:57,129
idea of universal content and content

00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:58,919
becomes a service so Drupal itself is

00:29:57,129 --> 00:30:03,100
really good at structured content

00:29:58,919 --> 00:30:05,440
metadata and you know within a single

00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:06,879
drupal install you know you can do lots

00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:08,919
of really cool things in fact you can

00:30:06,879 --> 00:30:11,529
share content out using a few eyes and

00:30:08,919 --> 00:30:13,179
lots of lots of different ways but this

00:30:11,529 --> 00:30:14,440
is another case of us seeing people

00:30:13,179 --> 00:30:15,909
doing this in lots of different ways and

00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:18,159
thinking maybe we can standardize this

00:30:15,909 --> 00:30:20,200
and make it a bit easier for everyone so

00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:21,639
content how its cloud-based content

00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:22,990
distribution discovery service that

00:30:21,639 --> 00:30:24,790
means effectively it's a big day

00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:27,190
bass sitting in AWS with a whole lot of

00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:28,990
api's against it that allows for

00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:34,120
automatic discovery and distribution of

00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:36,490
content we see this a lot we hear it a

00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:39,220
lot people have content all across the

00:30:36,490 --> 00:30:40,630
organization sorry the head and it's

00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:42,190
locked away so there's a whole lot of

00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:44,110
content that the team of Germany made

00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:47,920
which could be fantastic I don't even

00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:49,270
know exists or you know the UK team is

00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:51,520
creating a lot of stuff that everyone

00:30:49,270 --> 00:30:53,559
needs and the way they get it around as

00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:56,380
they stick it in an excel file and email

00:30:53,559 --> 00:30:59,530
it is just crazy but that's something we

00:30:56,380 --> 00:31:01,540
hear again and again and again what it

00:30:59,530 --> 00:31:03,340
means is that instead of trying to

00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:05,740
actually reuse the content that's been

00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:07,750
created at expense and effort people

00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:10,660
just recreate it again and again and

00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:11,890
again it's just easier to do it that way

00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:13,900
than to actually use of stuff that's

00:31:11,890 --> 00:31:16,030
already there and it also means that

00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:18,010
contoh gets locked so that people only

00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:20,410
ever see it via the CMS or it might make

00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:24,090
a lot of sense to sit somewhere else on

00:31:20,410 --> 00:31:27,040
a different channel in a different place

00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:28,480
so we created this this cloud-based

00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:30,700
service and we've built a lot of

00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:33,190
connectors as standard that interact

00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:34,990
with the API and that can aggregate

00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:37,000
content from those providers and put it

00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:40,630
into a normalized database which then

00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:43,300
other clients can consume so you know

00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:46,270
magento we've prius hybrids Dobby AEM

00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:48,309
Drupal and lots of things besides it's a

00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:49,570
simple API it's easy to integrate with

00:31:48,309 --> 00:31:51,010
but we are continually building

00:31:49,570 --> 00:31:54,820
connectives as customers ask for them

00:31:51,010 --> 00:31:56,470
and making them available that means

00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:58,470
that in a lot of cases we have customers

00:31:56,470 --> 00:32:01,059
who want to centralize content creation

00:31:58,470 --> 00:32:02,710
then we'll a single master site that

00:32:01,059 --> 00:32:07,840
pushes content out to all of their

00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:10,780
client sites or this is a more complex

00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:13,780
but happens a lot as well we every site

00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:16,960
is both a Content producer and a Content

00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:18,520
consumer in the content how manages all

00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:22,480
of that stuff so that all of the other

00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:23,890
sites know about it so it unlocked the

00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:26,230
content silos so that you can start

00:32:23,890 --> 00:32:29,370
moving content around it can either be

00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:31,929
hub-and-spoke or it can be peer-to-peer

00:32:29,370 --> 00:32:34,090
it doesn't need Drupal doesn't need to

00:32:31,929 --> 00:32:35,430
be the arbiter of what who that sees

00:32:34,090 --> 00:32:37,320
what you could have

00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:40,290
talking via content have that have

00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:41,820
nothing to do a triple of course we've

00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:47,720
got support for eight and seven and

00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:51,540
other stuff as well I when the Iridium e

00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:53,130
so this is actually yeah this is

00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:56,520
actually someone fiddling around with

00:32:53,130 --> 00:32:58,140
content hub in a Drupal 7 instance and

00:32:56,520 --> 00:33:01,950
you can see this is it's quite simple

00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:05,550
content it's a shounen I got on a

00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:06,840
reverse chronological order but as soon

00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:09,870
as content get spun to the hobbits

00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:11,250
basically instantly available so this

00:33:09,870 --> 00:33:13,350
business filtering through to see what's

00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:15,780
available you know basic filters around

00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:18,060
eight source stuff can be tagged and

00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:20,880
this is kind of using it in a manual

00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:23,640
fashion but it's got full rule support

00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:25,530
and Drupal so you can import content

00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:27,960
automatically and then put it into your

00:33:25,530 --> 00:33:30,660
workflow system so for example you might

00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:32,700
say if the site in the UK has new

00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:34,800
content automatically import it into my

00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:38,550
site but don't publish it send a

00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:40,320
notification to the content Edmond for

00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:45,030
checking so they can review it before

00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:47,660
they actually publish it yeah so that's

00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:47,660
content up

00:33:56,430 --> 00:34:01,360
so the question was about how we deal

00:33:58,930 --> 00:34:03,660
with translations and this unit going to

00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,660
cover that

00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:08,470
so we'd probably class in a kind of

00:35:05,650 --> 00:35:09,820
different category of tool so you know

00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:11,440
machine translation which is not

00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:12,850
something we provide is that clear as a

00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:15,910
service but there's lots of tools that

00:35:12,850 --> 00:35:17,380
plug into Drupal that can do that it's

00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:20,710
pretty ones and expensive ones and

00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:22,480
everything in between I think in

00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:25,330
practice I've seen I mean we've got lots

00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:26,770
of clients who run a multilingual suite

00:35:25,330 --> 00:35:28,590
of sites and practice they prefer to

00:35:26,770 --> 00:35:30,850
just get their people to do it because

00:35:28,590 --> 00:35:32,550
machine translation is great but it's

00:35:30,850 --> 00:35:35,200
not as good at the human either right

00:35:32,550 --> 00:35:37,210
and it's complex I mean managing all of

00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:39,070
that content across languages is really

00:35:37,210 --> 00:36:05,490
complex and I think while there are some

00:35:39,070 --> 00:36:08,770
really good solutions in the corner so

00:36:05,490 --> 00:36:10,600
is there any possibility to have I with

00:36:08,770 --> 00:36:12,880
the master content and that determined

00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:19,480
that if i reduce it to a tablet or

00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:21,370
mobile maybe I can yeah so then for me

00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:22,660
up to speed would really be droop whose

00:36:21,370 --> 00:36:26,080
responsibility and it's really about

00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:28,900
your information architecture so you

00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:30,970
know today I think responsive web

00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:33,130
designers most sites start with that in

00:36:30,970 --> 00:36:34,840
mind and the idea that you can see in

00:36:33,130 --> 00:36:36,790
for example or high-res image to a disk

00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:38,620
top and lower areas image to a mobile is

00:36:36,790 --> 00:36:41,290
really key there's a lot of JavaScript

00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:43,780
libraries in CSS conventions that can

00:36:41,290 --> 00:36:47,160
help with that but that's handle kind of

00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:49,300
at the Drupal legal so you know your

00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:50,860
information architecture might say give

00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:52,660
me a low res image in a high-res image

00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:53,680
and you'll be doing that at a triple

00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:55,030
level but content

00:36:53,680 --> 00:37:03,430
will then push that image around the hub

00:36:55,030 --> 00:37:18,780
it's required oh yeah sure structured

00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:18,780
content sure so right now content

00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:33,820
what's so for the most part

00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:27,720
it's the content hubs just an API driven

00:38:25,330 --> 00:38:30,190
service with no interface of its own

00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:31,810
well I think every single implementation

00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:33,190
we've done Drupal becomes the editing

00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:36,700
interface and the management interface

00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:39,310
but it's not strictly necessary but yeah

00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:40,810
we don't see content of becoming kind of

00:38:39,310 --> 00:38:42,640
a web app where you log in and edit

00:38:40,810 --> 00:38:46,230
content that's not what it does it's

00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:46,230
kind of plumbing to join sites together

00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:13,220
so

00:39:30,730 --> 00:39:35,440
so it will be imported as completely

00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:36,609
structured content so you'll just have

00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:39,609
like that interface i showed before

00:39:36,609 --> 00:39:41,859
you'll be able to say import this and

00:39:39,609 --> 00:39:43,180
typically i think if you're doing drupal

00:39:41,859 --> 00:39:45,160
to drupal communication and it will be

00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:47,050
the same content type so news article is

00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:48,609
another news article but again that's

00:39:47,050 --> 00:39:50,170
not strictly necessary you can create

00:39:48,609 --> 00:39:52,030
some rules on your side that says if i

00:39:50,170 --> 00:39:56,050
get a news article from site x y&z

00:39:52,030 --> 00:39:58,240
convert it in this way so you know that

00:39:56,050 --> 00:39:59,859
the kind of the ideal is that a lot of

00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:01,810
that stuff just happens automatically so

00:39:59,859 --> 00:40:04,330
there's no human intervention so as soon

00:40:01,810 --> 00:40:06,100
as the site's published out or suits

00:40:04,330 --> 00:40:07,510
content site published on a given site

00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:09,369
is pushed across other sites and

00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:10,930
practice I think most people want to

00:40:09,369 --> 00:40:14,920
make sure it's right before it goes out

00:40:10,930 --> 00:40:17,680
but its source references to image was

00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:20,290
right not yeah store that story URL to

00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:27,760
an image and then I'm the client site or

00:40:20,290 --> 00:40:31,300
when GC emergency right yeah yeah it's

00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:34,180
the short answer is yes yeah

00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:36,580
cool so the last kind of product i guess

00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:38,850
i'll talk about is left and this kind of

00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:42,190
sets right at the top so if you think of

00:40:38,850 --> 00:40:43,720
you think of drupal oh sorry BLT and

00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:46,150
lightning in cloud is kind of

00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:47,440
representing the code and site factor is

00:40:46,150 --> 00:40:51,820
representing the site this kind of

00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:55,000
represents the visit of the person and

00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:56,650
so the idea is you know broadly it fits

00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,600
into the personalization category and

00:40:56,650 --> 00:40:59,860
the idea is that we can know about every

00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:02,800
single visited that comes to the site

00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:04,750
and deliver them a customized

00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:06,010
personalized experience depending on

00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:08,490
their device or the channel or the

00:41:06,010 --> 00:41:10,720
context in which they're visiting and

00:41:08,490 --> 00:41:12,040
you know drip was actually been quite

00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:13,300
good at what we call explicit

00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:15,400
personalization for years and years

00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:17,200
which is when I've got a user account on

00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:19,060
a site and I say I like this in that and

00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:21,580
the souther thing trip was really good

00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:24,400
at editing a page with actively changing

00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:27,190
a page to suit those preferences what

00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:28,600
it's maybe not quite as good at is doing

00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:31,090
that for anonymous users that it knows

00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:32,350
nothing about there's some challenges

00:41:31,090 --> 00:41:33,610
there because clearly we don't know

00:41:32,350 --> 00:41:35,260
anything about them when they turn up

00:41:33,610 --> 00:41:36,640
it's the biggest challenge but there's

00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:40,380
also some performance issues some

00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:42,940
management issues how do we handle that

00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:45,190
so we have created this this idea of

00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:47,470
lift which is a client that runs on top

00:41:45,190 --> 00:41:50,800
of your drupal site allows you to track

00:41:47,470 --> 00:41:53,380
a range of behavior about the user so

00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:56,170
broadly that's situation or behavior so

00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:58,930
when I turn up I I can tell that I'm on

00:41:56,170 --> 00:42:00,940
my iPhone I can tell by my IP that I

00:41:58,930 --> 00:42:02,740
live in London because I know the time

00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:04,180
and that I'm in London I know the time

00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:07,180
of day in London I know what the weather

00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:09,250
is as i begin to browse through the site

00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:10,900
we start looking at behavioral data so i

00:42:09,250 --> 00:42:12,160
start clicking on certain things i can

00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:13,600
say oh it looks like this guy is

00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:15,820
interested in mountain bikes and

00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:17,710
headphones i'm going to show him content

00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:19,690
about that well it looks like this guy

00:42:17,710 --> 00:42:21,580
or people on iphones can to click on

00:42:19,690 --> 00:42:23,500
that banner and not that better maybe

00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:25,980
the next person who's on an iphone or

00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:29,800
i'll show the banner that they click on

00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:31,630
and yeah all of that we can all report

00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:34,090
on it all sits in the cloud this runs as

00:42:31,630 --> 00:42:37,420
a service integrator with drupal so but

00:42:34,090 --> 00:42:40,240
wit flow might be i turn up we can tell

00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:42,340
that this woman's come in she's cut some

00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:43,780
pages she searched for some stuff she

00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:45,070
might have downloaded some documents so

00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:46,570
we know behavior

00:42:45,070 --> 00:42:49,780
we know a situation she's on a mobile

00:42:46,570 --> 00:42:51,400
device she's in New York she feels in a

00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:54,160
form which hill gives us an email

00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:55,810
address so now we can if he comes back

00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:58,270
and we can link her against that email

00:42:55,810 --> 00:42:59,890
address but also we can start to look

00:42:58,270 --> 00:43:04,600
into other databases so if I've got a

00:42:59,890 --> 00:43:06,400
CRM if I got some other place where I'm

00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:08,830
storing data about that user because we

00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:10,810
can now linker it against your email we

00:43:08,830 --> 00:43:12,190
can see all of your history so you know

00:43:10,810 --> 00:43:13,450
she we can figure out whether she

00:43:12,190 --> 00:43:14,830
someone who's bought from us before or

00:43:13,450 --> 00:43:18,820
not if she is will show something

00:43:14,830 --> 00:43:21,730
different that's the idea so we want to

00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:23,980
try and capture as much data as we can

00:43:21,730 --> 00:43:27,070
about the users journey on every touch

00:43:23,980 --> 00:43:28,420
point yeah every data source and once we

00:43:27,070 --> 00:43:31,000
have that we can start doing stuff with

00:43:28,420 --> 00:43:33,220
it so from analytics kind of it the the

00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:35,980
simplest level starting to doing types

00:43:33,220 --> 00:43:37,840
of testing types of targeting we can

00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:39,430
also use the data in the database in

00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:40,840
other system so it doesn't necessarily

00:43:39,430 --> 00:43:42,520
need to be Drupal that's displaying the

00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:44,890
results of that personalization it could

00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:46,630
be like an email campaign or anything

00:43:44,890 --> 00:43:49,270
else you can just pull into the data via

00:43:46,630 --> 00:43:50,940
API and do things with it so you know

00:43:49,270 --> 00:43:53,320
you might have probably been victim of

00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:54,460
you've visited a site and you've clicked

00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:56,530
on a whole bunch of stuff and get an

00:43:54,460 --> 00:43:58,750
email the next day saying oh you want to

00:43:56,530 --> 00:44:00,610
buy a new computer that's the kind of

00:43:58,750 --> 00:44:05,290
thing that left can enable in a much

00:44:00,610 --> 00:44:07,810
better way cool there's also that

00:44:05,290 --> 00:44:11,230
unified visitor profile is reportable

00:44:07,810 --> 00:44:12,930
sits in a skinless database you can look

00:44:11,230 --> 00:44:15,730
at people visiting you can figure out

00:44:12,930 --> 00:44:18,240
you know what sort of people do what you

00:44:15,730 --> 00:44:21,700
can create dynamic segments so that

00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:23,560
after user does define things they can

00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:25,300
fit into a segment which you can being

00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:27,490
used to further reporting on

00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:29,230
personalization and why everything we

00:44:27,490 --> 00:44:34,450
try to do you can do that via the web we

00:44:29,230 --> 00:44:37,630
can do it via an API and so the idea is

00:44:34,450 --> 00:44:42,490
that you can do behavioral targeting we

00:44:37,630 --> 00:44:43,960
can do a be an interesting and it can

00:44:42,490 --> 00:44:46,180
get really big and complex

00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:49,990
personalization it's not a simple thing

00:44:46,180 --> 00:44:51,670
but the idea is basically if we can keep

00:44:49,990 --> 00:44:52,870
really good data eventually we can come

00:44:51,670 --> 00:44:54,610
up with some really good insights and

00:44:52,870 --> 00:44:55,460
the longer we do it the better we get at

00:44:54,610 --> 00:44:57,200
it

00:44:55,460 --> 00:44:58,700
I think that's really good at it the

00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:01,850
architecture is set up in such a way

00:44:58,700 --> 00:45:03,410
that you can really get a lot of

00:45:01,850 --> 00:45:06,260
information about who you for the desire

00:45:03,410 --> 00:45:08,120
and the CMS oh we're way as well so it

00:45:06,260 --> 00:45:09,140
knows about the metadata in your site

00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:10,940
and knows about your information

00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:12,980
architecture so it can use a lot of that

00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:17,150
stuff that may be a standard analytics

00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:19,760
package might not do so if we go back to

00:45:17,150 --> 00:45:21,110
this hopefully that diagram with all

00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:25,490
those buzzwords on it makes a little bit

00:45:21,110 --> 00:45:27,830
more sense you can see this is where the

00:45:25,490 --> 00:45:31,940
things for them so over here it's like

00:45:27,830 --> 00:45:34,550
blt pipelines cloud cloud site factory

00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:37,220
drupal and whitening content hub and

00:45:34,550 --> 00:45:40,670
then pushing it out across all of those

00:45:37,220 --> 00:45:44,030
devices and hopefully they'd all make

00:45:40,670 --> 00:45:45,260
sense against the cycle it's always a

00:45:44,030 --> 00:45:48,830
challenge but we feel like we're getting

00:45:45,260 --> 00:45:50,960
there I won't go into partners just on

00:45:48,830 --> 00:45:54,650
the basis of time but basically we can

00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:56,150
help you with this so we have we want to

00:45:54,650 --> 00:45:58,190
be a subscriptions company we don't want

00:45:56,150 --> 00:46:00,260
to sell services necessarily but what we

00:45:58,190 --> 00:46:01,520
what do want to do is make sure that if

00:46:00,260 --> 00:46:02,930
you're using Drupal when you're using it

00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:05,480
clear using it in the best way so if you

00:46:02,930 --> 00:46:06,860
need some help we can provide that and

00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:08,690
lots of ways whether that someone coming

00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:09,950
in and sitting beside you or whether

00:46:08,690 --> 00:46:11,240
it's someone on the end of the phone or

00:46:09,950 --> 00:46:13,880
whether it's training we can do all that

00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:15,290
kind of stuff in fact I think there's

00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:17,150
some if you're interested the

00:46:15,290 --> 00:46:20,150
certification going on during drupalcon

00:46:17,150 --> 00:46:23,120
for free so if you feel like trying one

00:46:20,150 --> 00:46:28,250
of the certification classes will be

00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:31,510
with chicken shits it so it's about time

00:46:28,250 --> 00:46:31,510
does anyone have any further questions

00:46:43,730 --> 00:46:50,150
giggity connectors on some access into

00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:53,030
the central database I have a UI where I

00:46:50,150 --> 00:46:55,460
can pick up to the filter I need can

00:46:53,030 --> 00:46:59,180
they also enrich the self positive ace

00:46:55,460 --> 00:47:05,650
with the information a half from the

00:46:59,180 --> 00:47:05,650
stage to the batting position 21

00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:12,200
the API is open like you can go on

00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:14,030
outside and docks by Ecuador

00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:16,940
conversation a PM read the API because

00:48:14,030 --> 00:48:19,430
there's no secret sauce here we will as

00:48:16,940 --> 00:48:21,650
time goes on have connectors and kind of

00:48:19,430 --> 00:48:23,330
the same way we do for content hub as

00:48:21,650 --> 00:48:25,130
they come up we'll develop them and put

00:48:23,330 --> 00:48:26,900
them out there I don't think we've got

00:48:25,130 --> 00:48:28,700
kind of a mature one for Salesforce yet

00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:29,810
we probably have customers somewhere

00:48:28,700 --> 00:48:31,460
doing some kind of Salesforce

00:48:29,810 --> 00:48:32,720
integration of it not in the way that we

00:48:31,460 --> 00:48:36,550
can kind of put out there is a product

00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:36,550
that's being tested in all use cases

00:48:59,050 --> 00:49:05,930
yeah so the answer is y i'm sure you can

00:49:02,930 --> 00:49:09,050
predict as it depends yeah a lot of this

00:49:05,930 --> 00:49:10,490
stuff a lot of stuff i started with is

00:49:09,050 --> 00:49:12,770
totally free some of the other stuff

00:49:10,490 --> 00:49:14,720
fake pipelines for example we're still

00:49:12,770 --> 00:49:16,820
nothing out the details some of that

00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:18,290
will be just available for all customers

00:49:16,820 --> 00:49:20,030
immediately there'll be some other

00:49:18,290 --> 00:49:23,540
features that may not be but we're not

00:49:20,030 --> 00:49:25,250
quite sure exactly what they are left is

00:49:23,540 --> 00:49:27,770
just about to launch a new vision very

00:49:25,250 --> 00:49:31,720
soon I love three I'm not privy to the

00:49:27,770 --> 00:49:31,720
pricing about that but you might be

00:49:41,270 --> 00:49:48,109
number of unique visitors a number of

00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:48,109
decisions yeah i think the model yeah

00:49:52,520 --> 00:50:00,570
marketing team lights has been money on

00:49:56,630 --> 00:50:02,670
html5 embeds understand optimization the

00:50:00,570 --> 00:50:05,210
metrics very well we is there a way to

00:50:02,670 --> 00:50:05,210
get them on

00:50:26,740 --> 00:50:30,550
but I think it's not a freemium model

00:50:29,050 --> 00:50:34,690
you can't you can't just turn it on

00:50:30,550 --> 00:50:37,180
there is an entry price but yeah I mean

00:50:34,690 --> 00:50:38,530
with the new launch we will be tearing

00:50:37,180 --> 00:50:39,730
in such a way that you should be able to

00:50:38,530 --> 00:50:41,350
start with something that you can

00:50:39,730 --> 00:50:45,580
demonstrate value immediately and wrap

00:50:41,350 --> 00:50:46,930
it up as it adds more and more similarly

00:50:45,580 --> 00:50:50,980
the content habits based on the number

00:50:46,930 --> 00:50:52,060
of sites that's not there's no doesn't

00:50:50,980 --> 00:50:55,450
matter how much content right it's just

00:50:52,060 --> 00:50:58,660
so exciting yeah so again it's a tiered

00:50:55,450 --> 00:51:00,430
model for you by I've got five sites

00:50:58,660 --> 00:51:03,490
I've got 50 sites about 500 sites and

00:51:00,430 --> 00:51:05,020
it's a different here better swing by

00:51:03,490 --> 00:51:08,369
the booth and find ourselves got

00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:14,340
material start telling you things yeah

00:51:08,369 --> 00:51:14,340
yeah anything else

00:51:27,980 --> 00:51:32,859
so first holy love Travis

00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:07,300
partners

00:52:42,910 --> 00:52:47,109
and just so basically there's there's

00:52:45,730 --> 00:52:54,420
only things that we can do that allow us

00:52:47,109 --> 00:52:54,420
more tightly because for example there

00:53:24,010 --> 00:53:40,380
okay well thank you very much probably

00:53:37,990 --> 00:53:40,380
