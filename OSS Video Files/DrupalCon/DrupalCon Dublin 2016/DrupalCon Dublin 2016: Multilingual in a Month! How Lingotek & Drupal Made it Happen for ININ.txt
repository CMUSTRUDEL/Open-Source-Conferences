Title: DrupalCon Dublin 2016: Multilingual in a Month! How Lingotek & Drupal Made it Happen for ININ
Publication date: 2016-09-27
Playlist: DrupalCon Dublin 2016
Description: 
	When the Interactive Intelligence (ININ) digital marketing team decided they wanted to make their soon-to-be-released Drupal website multilingual, they were under a time crunch and faced some daunting challenges. The site was planned to go live in December, and site construction started in November. ININ needed a multilingual solution that would integrate deeply with Drupal and enable an automated workflow for translation of their content.

This business showcase session will focus on the ININ project - initial goals, solution implemented, challenges overcome and lessons learned. During this 30-minute session, we will cover:

The initial challenges that this project faced

The multilingual Drupal solution that was implemented

Lessons learned & best practices for making your Drupal site multilingual

The value of an integrated, cloud-based translation solution

As this session will be more business focused, attendees do not need to have any specific Drupal knowledge in order to benefit from the presentation. Through this presentation, attendees will gain first-hand insight into the challenges facing Drupal sites that are moving towards multilingual capabilities and solutions to those common issues. The session will cover tips and tricks for those with multilingual projects, which will help those wishing to expand their brand and website internationally.

00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:13,889
where your excuse what you're expecting

00:00:11,309 --> 00:00:15,719
you know encourage it to stick around

00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:22,350

best practices as far as as doing an

00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:43,860
introduction I think it's helpful to get

with lingotek for over five years and I

00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:23,369
manage our client success group so we

00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:26,490
are involved with onboarding the client

00:01:23,369 --> 00:01:29,250
so that implementing implementing the

00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:32,070
software training them on it supporting

00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:36,930
them after after their on-boarded and

00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:39,689
using it this picture is from my first

00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:41,340
drupalcon so I've been in the Drupal

00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:43,890
community for over three years and my

00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:47,070
first drupalcon was portland 2013 and

00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:49,500
went out to the oregon coast as part of

00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:51,390
that trip and found this amazing green

00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:54,390
algae growing on the rock i couldn't

00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:55,740
believe it if you if you happen to take

00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:59,759
a trip to Portland don't miss the chance

00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:01,530
to go to the coast check that out that's

00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:04,110
actually not the twist of fate I was

00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:05,700
going to tell you about I really enjoy

00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:07,979
the Drupal community enjoyed learning

00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:10,379
about people getting to know them on a

00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:13,080
personal basis not just their technical

00:02:10,379 --> 00:02:14,880
skills or who they work for but you know

00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:19,800
or about kind of who they are and what

00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:21,810
makes them tick I I happen to grow up in

00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:25,560
a large family so there were 11 children

00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:29,460
in my family and 10 of us were boys so I

00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:31,410
i am number 7 in that group and you know

00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:33,000
felt very comfortable with with boys and

00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:34,440
kind of felt like I was starting to

00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,470
figure out you know how to relate to

00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:39,300
them how to raise them etc then I got

00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:42,120
married and was blessed with two

00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:43,740
beautiful little daughters so that's

00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:46,730
been a new experience for me you know

00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:48,240
trying to I'm now outnumbered and and

00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:50,120
learning a different way of

00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:52,230
communicating it's been a lot of fun I

00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:56,880
really am grateful to have them in my

00:02:52,230 --> 00:03:00,030
life let me tell you a little bit about

00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:02,640
lingotek so we are a company that does

00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:04,920
translation software and services we are

00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:08,520
headquartered in Utah in the greater

00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:10,640
salt lake area we have we are

00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:14,130
venture-backed as you can see there on

00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:16,410
the software side we have a cloud-based

00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:22,470
translation management system that was

00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:24,510
the first of its kind to market we this

00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:26,760
is an enterprise-level application so

00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:29,760
it's got lots of you know features for

00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:31,350
handling large difficult projects we'll

00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:34,050
talk more about some of those features a

00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:36,090
little later in the presentation we also

00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:38,640
have connectors that we built to pull

00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:41,640
content from your content management

00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:44,250
system and bring it into the cloud-based

00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:46,560
translation management app and then push

00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:47,790
the content back to your system so one

00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,040
of those connectors is our Drupal

00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:51,750
connector that will be focused on today

00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:53,880
we also have connectors in many other

00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:57,570
content management systems including

00:03:53,880 --> 00:04:00,630
Salesforce wordpress etc we have

00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:02,970
translation services so the if you're

00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:05,630
not familiar with translation services

00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:09,360
there's a it's largely staffed by

00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:12,180
professional freelancers these are you

00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:15,269
know independent contractors who live in

00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:18,239
the country where they are where they're

00:04:15,269 --> 00:04:22,200
translating for or the language that

00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:23,789
they're translating they these are folks

00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:25,530

00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:27,460
doctored

00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,199
degrees they've been translating for

00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:30,849
many years they're really good at what

00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,560
they do and I have a lot of respect for

00:04:30,849 --> 00:04:36,039
them it's a difficult job to do

00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:38,289
translation well our language services

00:04:36,039 --> 00:04:40,330
group takes that collection of

00:04:38,289 --> 00:04:42,009
individuals and certifies them puts them

00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:44,080
through tests to ensure their linguistic

00:04:42,009 --> 00:04:46,120
abilities and also certifies them on our

00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:49,139

integrations that we've built into our

00:04:54,729 --> 00:05:00,129
application we have many folks who have

00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:02,080
built custom integration so they they

00:05:00,129 --> 00:05:05,169
use our Deb's own and our multilingual

00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:06,669

about why you work why I like working

00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:49,449
lingotek this is that this is one of the

00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:53,219
more meaningful parts of it oh what

00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:53,219
happened there lost my video

00:05:55,630 --> 00:06:05,430
oh man this get this to play let's see

00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:05,430
one second

00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:23,570
okay one more second here

00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:44,210
may have to skip this but it's so good i

00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,210
don't want to skip it

00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:56,990
that's all right sorry for the technical

00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:56,990
challenge here

00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:14,629
like that okay well I'll skip that and

00:07:05,289 --> 00:07:20,150
the video was essentially the video was

00:07:14,629 --> 00:07:22,330
about here we go hey you get it after

00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:22,330
all

00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:45,090
alright well thanks to the Wi-Fi looks

00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:46,680
like we're not going to get it so let me

00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:51,780
explain it to you the video was we had a

00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:54,180
co-worker who had his dad had ALS and so

00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:58,740
during the the time of the ice bucket

00:07:54,180 --> 00:08:02,820
challenge we we did a challenge where we

00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:04,680
we had a big field of front loader full

00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:06,889
of water and dumped it on us for our

00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:09,810
fundraiser so it's a pretty neat thing

00:08:06,889 --> 00:08:12,539
the video is better than that but you

00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:14,039
know left to catch that another time so

00:08:12,539 --> 00:08:16,320
let's talk about interactive

00:08:14,039 --> 00:08:17,580
intelligence so they they're in and for

00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:22,320
short they're headquartered in

00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:23,699
Indianapolis Indiana this picture here

00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:25,949
is a picture of their headquarters this

00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:27,870
is one of those those businesses that is

00:08:25,949 --> 00:08:29,250
a large business that you may have you

00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:30,690
probably never heard of before unless

00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:35,159
you're in the industry that they serve

00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:40,050
they they focus on contact the solutions

00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:44,400
for the contact center industry and they

00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:46,350
have over 2,300 employees they also do a

00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:48,180
lot with business process automation so

00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:49,800
great company to work for but again

00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:52,680
probably one that unless you're in that

00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:54,839
industry you may not have heard of we we

00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:57,029
got familiar with them when they were

00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:59,430
replat forming their their corporate

00:08:57,029 --> 00:09:02,010
site on to Drupal 7 so they were working

00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:04,529
with an agency named blue coda and the

00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:06,540
agency was aware of us and brought us in

00:09:04,529 --> 00:09:14,390
and and we work together with them to

00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:18,029
redo their site as with any any any

00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:21,140
Drupal site there enlarge you know large

00:09:18,029 --> 00:09:24,630
complex projects there are challenges

00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:26,550
one of them is they had they had really

00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:29,730
bad process management so when they were

00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:31,529
trying to they're looking at ways of

00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:33,720
improving their translation management

00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:36,029
they realized that what they had was

00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:37,860
just not scalable and if you're if

00:09:36,029 --> 00:09:41,160
you're familiar with how translation is

00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:43,410
done the story probably probably rings

00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:46,830
true for for some of your clients where

00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:50,579
their copy pasting they're sending files

00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:52,709
around they're not you know it's not

00:09:50,579 --> 00:09:53,680
automated at all there's no version

00:09:52,709 --> 00:09:57,070
control so they

00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:58,810
a marketing creates a word document they

00:09:57,070 --> 00:10:00,399
send it out to the translators marketing

00:09:58,810 --> 00:10:03,370
changes that they send it back there's

00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:07,170
no way to track those changes etc it's a

00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:10,630
very inefficient error-prone process

00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:12,070
there were tight deadlines they had they

00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:13,660
were starting to build the site out in

00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:15,160
November and they want it launched in

00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:17,950
december and they wanted all the

00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:19,330
translations done that's with the amount

00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:21,899
of content that we were dealing with I

00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:26,410
was a pretty aggressive timeline so

00:10:21,899 --> 00:10:28,450
trying to make that happen on time you

00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:30,100
know they when they looked at that they

00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:31,899
said we need a solution that works out

00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:35,260
of the box you know we don't have time

00:10:31,899 --> 00:10:37,480
to to customize a bunch of stuff we've

00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:38,709
got to just have a plug and play and be

00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:44,380
ready to go and that was part of the

00:10:38,709 --> 00:10:47,110
benefit of what our solution offered and

00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:48,910
then they also had non-technical

00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:51,130
reviewers that that they need to

00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:54,250
incorporate feedback for so these are in

00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:57,070
and staff who they're not linguists but

00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:58,810
they're bilingual speakers and they are

00:10:57,070 --> 00:11:01,000
experts in their subject area and they

00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:05,860
want wanted to incorporate the feedback

00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:08,200
from those those staff and for them you

00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:09,880
know that this is not their their day

00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:12,459
job this is something they're doing on

00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:14,440
the side it's very challenging to to

00:11:12,459 --> 00:11:16,600
engage with them because they have lots

00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:19,420
of other priorities they need a solution

00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:21,070
that is quick and easy and something

00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:24,370
that that they don't have to spend a lot

00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:28,140
of time coming up to speed on so that

00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:28,140
they were looking for help in that area

00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:33,910
some of the project logistics they were

00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:37,660
starting out with nine languages and

00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:41,500
then growing that to 12 there were over

00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:43,600
470 pages of content and for website you

00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:46,750
know this is this is common web content

00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:48,339
tends to be a lot smaller and and there

00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:52,149
tends to be a lot of pages rather than

00:11:48,339 --> 00:11:54,810
big long form pages and this the number

00:11:52,149 --> 00:11:57,160
of pages exacerbates any process

00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:58,690
problems that you have right when you've

00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:01,060
got a bunch of pages if you're doing

00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:03,459
this copy paste and sending files back

00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:05,440
and forth it just makes it exponentially

00:12:03,459 --> 00:12:07,089
harder to keep track of all that is your

00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:10,360
page size goes up

00:12:07,089 --> 00:12:12,519
the word count 33,000 words over also

00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:15,699
you know not a huge word count but

00:12:12,519 --> 00:12:17,290
decent and given the number of pages you

00:12:15,699 --> 00:12:20,139
know makes it difficult and then we had

00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:22,720
numerous contributors and time zones so

00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:24,519
with you start to think of all the

00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:28,149
different people involved that have to

00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:30,519
touch this you've got a professional

00:12:28,149 --> 00:12:32,620
human translator a separate professional

00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:34,779
reviewer and then you have in and staff

00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:37,480
spread out all over different time zones

00:12:34,779 --> 00:12:39,879
you've got project managers sprinkled in

00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:42,100
there in addition to the localization

00:12:39,879 --> 00:12:43,769
project managers on the inside so

00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:46,420
there's there's a lot of different

00:12:43,769 --> 00:12:48,670
people involved in coordinating that

00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:51,160
making sure that there the work is being

00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:54,550
done in a timely manner you know that's

00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:55,959
that's why our application exists to

00:12:54,550 --> 00:13:02,829
help address some of those project

00:12:55,959 --> 00:13:06,999
management challenges so to address

00:13:02,829 --> 00:13:09,699
these we we helped the client implement

00:13:06,999 --> 00:13:12,399
the lingotek solution so as we've talked

00:13:09,699 --> 00:13:13,800
about we have a translation management

00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:16,929
application it's a cloud-based

00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:19,870
application that's the image down there

00:13:16,929 --> 00:13:23,889
on the bottom and then up top is the

00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:25,720
drupal module so this this is a module

00:13:23,889 --> 00:13:28,389
that you plug into your site we have

00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:33,249
both d7 and d8 versions of the module

00:13:28,389 --> 00:13:35,170
and it it does a couple things for you

00:13:33,249 --> 00:13:36,999
one is it helps configure your

00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:38,920
multilingual environment if you've ever

00:13:36,999 --> 00:13:40,629
done multilingual and d7 you know that

00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:42,819
there are a lot of switches a lot of

00:13:40,629 --> 00:13:45,040
modules and it can be a challenge just

00:13:42,819 --> 00:13:46,809
getting everything set up we have a

00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,699
configuration wizard that walks you

00:13:46,809 --> 00:13:50,819
through that process automatically

00:13:48,699 --> 00:13:53,589
installing the modules that you need

00:13:50,819 --> 00:13:55,629
configuring those and then we also have

00:13:53,589 --> 00:13:57,999
an admin screen that allows you to pick

00:13:55,629 --> 00:14:00,399
which content types and fields are

00:13:57,999 --> 00:14:03,100
translatable turn those off off and on

00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:05,110
and manage them in one place and then we

00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:08,139
have an admin screen that allows you to

00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:10,269
see exactly what content is on your site

00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:12,939
and select it for translation and send

00:14:10,269 --> 00:14:16,720
it up so a lot of a lot of management

00:14:12,939 --> 00:14:18,850
built into the process when the module

00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,540
exports the content it sends it up to

00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:23,180
the translation management

00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:26,240
system which imports it so we send it up

00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:30,020
as an XML file send it through a filter

00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:34,390
to embed it or to filter it out and and

00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:36,560
bring it into our system the cloud-based

00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:38,990
translation management system then does

00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:41,000
several things to help you reuse your

00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:42,980
your pass content so if you're not

00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:46,100
familiar with translation technology

00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:48,890
there's this feature called translation

00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:51,230
memory which is where the system will

00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:53,510
track all of your past translations in a

00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:56,030
database and when you have new content

00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:57,770
that you translate it compares the

00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:59,630
source of what you're translating so

00:14:57,770 --> 00:15:02,420
let's say an English sentence it

00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:06,650
compares that to other English sentences

00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:08,690
in the database and and uses logic to

00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:10,640
determine how strong of a match it is

00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:12,680
and if you find something that is

00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:16,970
exactly the same meaning same grammar

00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:18,650
punctuation white space etc the project

00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:20,300
manager can choose to reuse that

00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:22,730
translation and just pull it right into

00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:25,370
your document so it that does two things

00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:26,840
for you one is it saves time so the

00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:28,850
translator doesn't have to look at that

00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:30,590
sentence they can just skip over it it

00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:33,560
also saves money so in a paid

00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:35,900
translation scenario you can save save

00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:39,470
significant money by reusing your past

00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:41,480
translations another feature of the

00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:44,540
system is that it the drupal module

00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:46,460
tracks changes in your content so when

00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:50,330
you have nodes that are getting updated

00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:52,520
the on the admin applicant on the admin

00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:55,730
screen it will show you which nodes were

00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:57,800
changed and if you can have those set to

00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:58,880
automatically upload if you want or if

00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:01,550
you want to make it a manual process

00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:04,460
where you see what has changed and then

00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:08,270
upload it you can do that as well any

00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:09,950
questions on on this piece of it feel

00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:13,160
free to you know we'll have a question

00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:15,350
time afterwards feel free to just ask

00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:17,620
that happy to dive into more details

00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:17,620
there

00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:21,899
so what are some of the results of

00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:23,820
implementing this well there were

00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:25,769
greater translate the greater efficiency

00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:28,529
for in and they spent a lot less time

00:16:25,769 --> 00:16:31,050
chasing emails around their their

00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:33,000
project managers could log into the

00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:36,149
system and see exactly where they were

00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:39,089
at in real time one of the the

00:16:36,149 --> 00:16:40,500
challenges that people often have on

00:16:39,089 --> 00:16:43,110
doing translation is it's kind of a

00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:45,750
black box they packaged up their files

00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:48,240
send it over to the translation provider

00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:49,800
and then hope that you know they come

00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:52,649
back to them by the deadline and they're

00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:54,450
done with the system like this you can

00:16:52,649 --> 00:16:57,269
just see exactly where everything is

00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:59,070
that there's no more guessing and you

00:16:57,269 --> 00:17:02,750
know that that takes a lot of stress out

00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:02,750
of it for lots of different folks

00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:09,569
improve time-to-market so the when you

00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:12,419
build these efficiencies into the system

00:17:09,569 --> 00:17:14,730
the translation process gets faster the

00:17:12,419 --> 00:17:16,850
delivery gets quicker we mentioned the

00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:20,370
copy/paste you know that slows you down

00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:22,309
on the exporting the content and also

00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:25,559
honry importing it because you've got a

00:17:22,309 --> 00:17:27,390
typically a technical staff member who's

00:17:25,559 --> 00:17:28,950
having to take this word document and

00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:33,150
figure out how to put that back into

00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:35,640
their site and copy and pasted pasting

00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:39,030
and getting things wrong sometimes so

00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:40,890
cut all that out and you provide a much

00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:46,950
quicker turnaround on translations and

00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:49,950
also accelerate time-to-market when

00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:52,140
after in and went live they saw an

00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:54,120
increase in their website traffic for

00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:56,400
the the translated pages you know that's

00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:58,580
that's part of the big driver here is is

00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,630
they wanted to be able to talk to their

00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:03,840
international users in their language

00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:06,570
have all the different parts of their

00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:10,650
message beyond brand and give them the

00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:12,059
same customer experience they were able

00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:14,010
to achieve that and then they had higher

00:18:12,059 --> 00:18:16,620
staff engagement satisfaction so we

00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:19,500
talked about this challenge of the in

00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:22,020
end staff not being dedicated to this

00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:23,970
full time and you know if you give them

00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:25,559
a good tool that they can use they feel

00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:29,100
like they're contributing to the process

00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:30,840
and that results in willingness to keep

00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:31,860
going and also no greater satisfaction

00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:38,100
seeing

00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:41,100
the website live this is a quote from

00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:44,280
cause suzuki who was one of our main

00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:48,870
leads their lead contacts it at inin and

00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:51,030
you know he he was grateful to see the

00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:53,460
project succeed you know on us as the

00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:55,080
digital agencies here no that's this is

00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:57,750
the end game right to be able to have a

00:18:55,080 --> 00:19:00,290
mutual success for them and for you

00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:08,549
something that you can both build on and

00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:11,100
and continue to to refine and improve so

00:19:08,549 --> 00:19:14,460
the next step is to expand the network

00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:17,820
you know one once you have one connector

00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:20,340
installed and you've got some folks

00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:22,530
internally who understand the vision see

00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:25,020
that there's see the benefit to bringing

00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:27,530
in content from different connectors and

00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:30,299
storing that in a central system and

00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:32,429
reusing translations across your

00:19:30,299 --> 00:19:34,830
different applications once they catch

00:19:32,429 --> 00:19:37,110
this then it's a natural step to say

00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:39,900
well what else can we bring in you know

00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:42,240
we're using we're using l acquire we're

00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:45,290
using liferay let's let's bring that in

00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:47,820
and in an art is taking those steps and

00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:50,130
you know we we see this with many

00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:52,200
organizations they they feel like their

00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:53,700
content is very siloed and they've got

00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:55,590
different departments who are doing

00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:57,299
their own thing in terms of translation

00:19:55,590 --> 00:20:01,020
they really want a way to centralize it

00:19:57,299 --> 00:20:06,240
and reuse it and that's part of what a

00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:08,160
solution like this offers so what were

00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:11,580
some of the lessons learned and some

00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:13,169
best practices we might recommend first

00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:15,179
one is to build with multilingual in

00:20:13,169 --> 00:20:17,429
mind and i know that this sounds like a

00:20:15,179 --> 00:20:19,890
you know kind of an obvious one but

00:20:17,429 --> 00:20:22,590
you'd be surprised how this comes back

00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:25,799
to bite people over and over the the

00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:27,690
challenges many agencies have their

00:20:25,799 --> 00:20:29,490
preferred ways of doing things right

00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:32,400
they have modules that they like they

00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:35,309
have certain configurations that they

00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:39,450
like and those may or may not play that

00:20:35,309 --> 00:20:41,970
well with multilingual and often you'll

00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:44,190
get the site built out and then try to

00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:45,779
use it realize oh oh no this certain

00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:48,419
module you know has the

00:20:45,779 --> 00:20:50,820
serious issues or is not compatible in

00:20:48,419 --> 00:20:52,859
this way so starting with that in mind

00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:54,899
is really important you know would

00:20:52,859 --> 00:20:57,779
encourage you especially if you're in d8

00:20:54,899 --> 00:20:59,219
to do some looking in the issue queues

00:20:57,779 --> 00:21:01,830
for the modules that you're planning to

00:20:59,219 --> 00:21:04,769
use and you know get a feel for for what

00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:07,019
might work well with with what you're

00:21:04,769 --> 00:21:09,179
trying to build and this is something

00:21:07,019 --> 00:21:10,369
that we're happy to work with you on so

00:21:09,179 --> 00:21:14,789
you know if you have questions about

00:21:10,369 --> 00:21:17,549
about certain modules feel free to hit

00:21:14,789 --> 00:21:19,649
us up on it but that that will save you

00:21:17,549 --> 00:21:22,519
a lot of lost time down the road if you

00:21:19,649 --> 00:21:24,899
start with molting than going mind

00:21:22,519 --> 00:21:26,700
second item is to get the right

00:21:24,899 --> 00:21:29,039
translation solution for what you're

00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:30,690
trying to do and we're very candid to

00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:32,969
admit that our solution is not the right

00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:36,059
fit for everybody there are certain

00:21:32,969 --> 00:21:38,009
cases where it may make sense to use

00:21:36,059 --> 00:21:40,889
something out of the box with Drupal so

00:21:38,009 --> 00:21:42,599
Drupal has multilingual capabilities

00:21:40,889 --> 00:21:44,820
where you can insert translations

00:21:42,599 --> 00:21:47,339
directly into the site it doesn't give

00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:49,979
you translation memory or some the

00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:51,269
process management aspects to it but it

00:21:49,979 --> 00:21:53,179
can be an effective way to get

00:21:51,269 --> 00:21:55,649
translation directly added to your site

00:21:53,179 --> 00:21:58,830
there are also solutions that allow you

00:21:55,649 --> 00:22:01,049
to export files so you know download

00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:03,299
files and send them off to provider so

00:22:01,049 --> 00:22:05,099
if your client is wanting to do they've

00:22:03,299 --> 00:22:06,539
got a provider that they've always been

00:22:05,099 --> 00:22:08,789
working with and they want to keep

00:22:06,539 --> 00:22:11,369
working with them then you know maybe

00:22:08,789 --> 00:22:14,369
using using a solution like that is the

00:22:11,369 --> 00:22:15,989
best fit and then you know as we've

00:22:14,369 --> 00:22:18,239
talked about their clients who need an

00:22:15,989 --> 00:22:20,789
enterprise solution they need the full

00:22:18,239 --> 00:22:23,129
features that a solution like ours

00:22:20,789 --> 00:22:27,739
provides and in those cases you know it

00:22:23,129 --> 00:22:27,739
can can be a big big time-saver for them

00:22:29,149 --> 00:22:36,029
scope and get started this applies more

00:22:33,029 --> 00:22:38,279
to the the translation of the content

00:22:36,029 --> 00:22:41,549
than the technical piece but one of the

00:22:38,279 --> 00:22:43,950
things that tends to get people stressed

00:22:41,549 --> 00:22:45,419
and confused about translation projects

00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:48,719
is the timing of when it all comes

00:22:45,419 --> 00:22:52,379
together so in in ins case they were

00:22:48,719 --> 00:22:54,479
building the site and planning to get it

00:22:52,379 --> 00:22:56,940
launched quickly but they weren't

00:22:54,479 --> 00:22:59,520
starting the build until November and

00:22:56,940 --> 00:23:02,040
they already had a bunch of content

00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:04,860
ready to go and they knew that if they

00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:06,690
started translating in November they may

00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:08,850
not get all get everything done in time

00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:10,250
to launch and so you know how do you how

00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:12,540
do you handle this when you've got

00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:15,570
content but the site's not ready to

00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:19,650
support that content yet well what we do

00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:21,480
is we start the we work on the files

00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:25,200
that they have so if they've got it

00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:27,660
written in Word or in some other format

00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:30,540
we can import those files directly into

00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:32,970
our system do the translation store it

00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:35,550
in translation memory and then when the

00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:37,890
Drupal site is ready upload the files

00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:40,350
from Drupal and have the translations

00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:42,980
fill in from translation memory that

00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:45,720
allows the the technical piece to

00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:48,270
progress at its own schedule get the

00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:51,360
translations done ahead of time and then

00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:54,290
tie them back together using translation

00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:57,300
memory that's been a very effective

00:23:54,290 --> 00:23:59,310
approach and you know something that we

00:23:57,300 --> 00:24:01,320
recommend especially in a in a project

00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:06,420
like this when you've got varying

00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:09,920
timelines another one is to develop

00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:12,870
internal champions so you know this is a

00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:16,680
change in behavior a change in approach

00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:19,110
for for a business you're going to need

00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:21,720
somebody internally who understands the

00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:24,650
value of it both strategically and

00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:28,230
tactically so you want to make sure that

00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:29,880
you you have those people identified and

00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:33,630
that you're supporting them however

00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:36,600
however they need you know cause was was

00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:38,430
one of the folks for us who in his case

00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:40,740
he happened to be both strategic and

00:24:38,430 --> 00:24:42,750
tactical oftentimes we'll see those

00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:44,250
rules split so you kind of have an

00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:47,040
executive sponsor and then you'll have

00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:49,860
maybe a project manager and make a

00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:51,720
developer who's working on the site but

00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:53,400
you want to identify those folks and

00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:58,470
make them successful you know make sure

00:24:53,400 --> 00:25:00,620
they have what they need the last one is

00:24:58,470 --> 00:25:03,240
to foster teamwork and collaboration so

00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:04,440
as the digital agencies know you know

00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:07,410
they're there are a lot of different

00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:09,780
players in a in a project like this

00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:11,310
especially if you start to add in the

00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:12,930
translators and reviewers and the

00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:15,000
linguistic staff you know it gets

00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:18,690
be a pretty good group of people to

00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:21,630
manage and keeping everyone on the same

00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:23,340
page keeping everyone moving in the same

00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:25,710
direction can be a real challenge but

00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:28,380
that's part of what is required to make

00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:32,310
a project like this successful so doing

00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:34,770
regular status calls with them providing

00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:37,500
training you know that's that's all

00:25:34,770 --> 00:25:39,840
important to to help everyone feel

00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:43,640
cohesive and and feel like they're

00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:43,640
getting their questions answered and

00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:50,760
with that we'll go ahead and turn it

00:25:47,610 --> 00:26:02,070
over for questions any questions from

00:25:50,760 --> 00:26:05,850
the audience yeah we we do yep we so we

00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:07,980
have a Drupal 8 module and the gentleman

00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:12,450
in the back raise your hand Christian

00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:14,790
penasquitos he's our local Drupal 8

00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:17,640
rockstar so we're so glad to have him on

00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:20,480
the team and he can answer any questions

00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:27,050
you might have about our Drupal 8 module

00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:27,050
good question yeah

00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:39,169
yeah that's a great question so this is

00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:41,510
a part that is confusing for folks

00:26:39,169 --> 00:26:43,460
because they they understand that

00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:44,900
there's different workflows in Drupal

00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:47,960
you know and you can use something like

00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:50,240
workbench automation to sorry workbench

00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:52,340
moderation to implement a workflow and

00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:55,400
then you've got translation workflows

00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:58,370
you know you might have a translate step

00:26:55,400 --> 00:27:00,440
a review step a linguistic review by the

00:26:58,370 --> 00:27:02,570
client so how do you tie those together

00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:06,500
and that's that's what our module does

00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:08,450
so we have we can use the rules module

00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:11,360
to integrate with with workbench

00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:14,179
moderation stages and you can set

00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:15,860
triggers so that when content reaches a

00:27:14,179 --> 00:27:18,440
certain stage in your workbench

00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:20,630
moderation flow it then goes up to

00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:23,179
lingotek goes through the translation

00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:25,309
flow and then comes back into work bench

00:27:23,179 --> 00:27:28,730
moderation so you can have like an in

00:27:25,309 --> 00:27:30,409
translate state in workbench send it up

00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:31,820
send it through and then bring it back

00:27:30,409 --> 00:27:37,900
down and keep it going through the

00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:37,900
process good question yeah

00:27:51,879 --> 00:27:53,940
you

00:27:56,179 --> 00:28:01,940
yeah yeah yeah that's that's another

00:28:00,019 --> 00:28:04,039
good question so we've there are two

00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:06,950
main ways of storing translation in

00:28:04,039 --> 00:28:09,049
Drupal 7 the first is field-based or

00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:13,429
it's all it's also called entity based

00:28:09,049 --> 00:28:15,860
and that method Drupal is storing a row

00:28:13,429 --> 00:28:17,659
in the field table appropriate for that

00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:19,669
field and then flagging it with the

00:28:17,659 --> 00:28:21,740
language code so there's there's no

00:28:19,669 --> 00:28:23,990
extra nodes being created it's just

00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:25,999
storing data in the field table the

00:28:23,990 --> 00:28:28,249
other method is node based translation

00:28:25,999 --> 00:28:31,159
and in that when the translations

00:28:28,249 --> 00:28:34,309
downloaded a new node is created and so

00:28:31,159 --> 00:28:37,309
our module supports both by content type

00:28:34,309 --> 00:28:39,230
so if you have one content type that

00:28:37,309 --> 00:28:41,330
makes sense to do no translation a

00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:43,190
common use case there is press releases

00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:45,049
where they might say hey I you know I

00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:46,610
only want this in certain languages and

00:28:45,049 --> 00:28:49,129
I want to do some custom stuff with the

00:28:46,610 --> 00:28:51,740
menus whatnot so you can you can set

00:28:49,129 --> 00:28:54,139
that press release content type to store

00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:57,440
using node translation and then set your

00:28:54,139 --> 00:29:00,019
other other content types of store using

00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:03,649
entity translation and for what it's

00:29:00,019 --> 00:29:06,350
worth you know we if the client doesn't

00:29:03,649 --> 00:29:08,330
have a business reason for choosing one

00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:10,309
at the other we recommend field

00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:13,429
translation or entity translation that's

00:29:10,309 --> 00:29:16,100
the rupa late model and so you know what

00:29:13,429 --> 00:29:18,559
makes the site a little more future

00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:21,409
proof if you can do entity translation

00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:32,659
but as I mentioned we support both in

00:29:21,409 --> 00:29:34,309
Drupal 7 yeah it's a good question so as

00:29:32,659 --> 00:29:36,259
I mentioned about right sizing the

00:29:34,309 --> 00:29:38,149
translation solution there are some

00:29:36,259 --> 00:29:44,480
cases where it makes sense to proxy and

00:29:38,149 --> 00:29:47,690
you know they're some of the the pros to

00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:49,850
proxying is that you can you can scrape

00:29:47,690 --> 00:29:52,700
the content off the site you know and

00:29:49,850 --> 00:29:56,240
and have it displayed it's in some cases

00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:58,460
it can be a little easier to install and

00:29:56,240 --> 00:30:01,700
get going there are some real challenges

00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:03,710
with it though one is that you you are

00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:06,440
no longer using the content management

00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:08,450
system so that it you know you've you've

00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:10,040
invested in this system you've got it

00:30:08,450 --> 00:30:12,890
built up but now you're real

00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:16,880
hang on this third party to to manage

00:30:12,890 --> 00:30:19,340
your content and in other cases you know

00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:20,900
depending on where that that proxy is

00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:24,050
hosted you may have challenges getting

00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:25,790
certain countries to be able to view the

00:30:24,050 --> 00:30:27,740
page so there can be some real

00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:30,980
challenges with it but again you know

00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:44,690
it's in the right case it can it can be

00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:47,330
effective for yeah yeah for right to

00:30:44,690 --> 00:30:50,690
left you're saying uh-huh yep we support

00:30:47,330 --> 00:30:52,310
those and are there's the translator

00:30:50,690 --> 00:30:53,780
workbench is the environment where the

00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:56,510
translator is actually doing the work

00:30:53,780 --> 00:31:13,310
and it you know it switches to to

00:30:56,510 --> 00:31:16,160
accommodate that right haha yeah and

00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:17,600
some of that so and this is a good a

00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:21,590
good point in something to be aware of

00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:24,290
so there as you internationalize your

00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:25,820
site localize it there are certain

00:31:24,290 --> 00:31:27,860
pieces that won't be handled by a

00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:31,430
translation solution you know and some

00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:34,220
of that is is this image assets yeah so

00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:36,380
ours yeah our solution focuses on the

00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:39,200
the written content and handling the

00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:45,260
assets is done usually be a separate

00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:49,780
matter yeah yeah it's a sticky one for

00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:49,780
sure yeah other questions

00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:57,930
