is such a special time for everyone and

00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:14,759
it has taken a lot of work from the

00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:17,580
Drupal Association staff the local

00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:18,720

00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:35,510
working for the Association for the last

00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:38,850
six years and I got a new job recently

00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:40,950
yeah I'm I have the new executive

00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:43,460
director of the Drupal Association and

00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:45,840
I'm so honored to serve all of you and

00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:48,120
I'm going to be working more on

00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:51,780
furthering our mission which is to unite

00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:55,440
all of you so that we can help you build

00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:57,809
and promote the software and I just

00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:01,890
wanted to let you know how important it

00:00:57,809 --> 00:01:05,640
is to me to do my job well and to make

00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:08,460
sure that we keep doing our part to make

00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:10,170
Drupal thrive and just to help you with

00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:14,400
that all the great things that you're

00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:17,159
doing and really it's it's personal for

00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:20,159
me because so many of you have inspired

00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:22,500
me to really love what you do and take

00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,720
care of this project and the way that we

00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:28,350
can and it has to do with so many

00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:31,979
stories like the one what's gone the

00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:35,310
right direction like Fernando Garcia who

00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:37,500
took our global project and created jobs

00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:40,049
locally throughout South America he's

00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:42,090
traveled all over creating camps and

00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:44,700
trainings showing people how they can

00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:47,909
create new opportunities with Drupal and

00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:49,470
we all rally around each other and such

00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:52,560
meaningful ways to help each other out

00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:54,960
and I'm still I still get choked up when

00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,119
I think about how everyone came together

00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:02,939
to support Arin wind-borne who's a

00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:06,570
longtime contributor who passed recently

00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:09,270
of ALS and the community just really

00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:11,370
came together to support him and we now

00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:15,000
have an award that we give out to

00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:16,349
a strong contributor every year and I'm

00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,500
very proud that the community working

00:02:16,349 --> 00:02:21,930
group does that in his honor and then

00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:25,200
there's also business owners that are

00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:26,700
giving back to this project and it's not

00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,959
just about business for them it's about

00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:32,129
the community

00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:34,470
Danya Gerhart the CEO of amazing labs is

00:02:32,129 --> 00:02:37,230
someone that comes to mind she is always

00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:38,730
supporting women in Drupal her business

00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:41,310
is always supporting camps and

00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:42,959
sponsoring DrupalCon but she's also

00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:44,970
making sure that her staff is

00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:49,530
contributing back and really believes in

00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:51,780
being part of this community and another

00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:54,030
business kind of relationship it's

00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:56,459
always about the people though you know

00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:58,769
John Kennedy comes to mind he reached

00:02:56,459 --> 00:03:00,480
out to me one day and said Acquia is

00:02:58,769 --> 00:03:02,730
going to contribute half a million

00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:05,970
dollars towards this grant program that

00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:08,730
will help people migrate modules to

00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:10,650
Drupal 8 and he said you know I want to

00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:13,049
do some fundraising so we can create

00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:16,290
more money for this grant would that be

00:03:13,049 --> 00:03:17,880
okay and I'm thinking yeah I think

00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:20,549
that's a really great idea

00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:22,440
and so you know it's just amazing how

00:03:20,549 --> 00:03:24,239
people even come and check with me to

00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:28,739
see if it's okay that they do such great

00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:31,290
things and then even the end users are

00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:34,079
really generous you know we think that

00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:35,940
our end users are just consumers of the

00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:37,859
software but they're not they're also

00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:39,209
part of our community and I love the

00:03:37,859 --> 00:03:42,419
story of Mike lamb who you'll meet

00:03:39,209 --> 00:03:44,220
tomorrow on stage but he's the one who's

00:03:42,419 --> 00:03:46,949
responsible for Drupal being adopted in

00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:48,599
a big way at Pfizer and he has a great

00:03:46,949 --> 00:03:51,060
team that's contributing back to the

00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:52,949
project but he's not just about making

00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:54,750
up you know encouraging his team to

00:03:52,949 --> 00:03:56,940
contribute he wants his whole supply

00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:59,430
chain contributing and so he partners

00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:02,669
with app innovation who actually funded

00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:06,060
the development of composer and then

00:04:02,669 --> 00:04:09,449
just another story that I really am

00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:12,150
inspired by is Herbert bird of media so

00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:14,609
they are a publishing online publishing

00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:17,389
company out of Germany and they fell in

00:04:14,609 --> 00:04:20,010
love with the ethos of open source and

00:04:17,389 --> 00:04:22,169
Drupal and they realize they're going to

00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:24,070
be competing on content not technology

00:04:22,169 --> 00:04:26,080
but they still want great technology

00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:27,820
and so what they've done is they've

00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:30,460
gotten together with competitors and

00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:32,260
other shops in this in this area in the

00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:33,640
space and they created a distribution

00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:35,260
called thunder now they're giving that

00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:38,800
back to the community for everyone to

00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:42,010
use and so you know these are all the

00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:46,480
stories that inspire me and I have so

00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:48,790
many so many more and you know it's it's

00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:50,500
I think what I like the most about these

00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:52,060
stories is that it's individuals and

00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:55,450
businesses working together to make

00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:56,560
Drupal great and it's there's so many

00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:58,630
stories that could tell but I can

00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,610
actually just show you when the data so

00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:04,180
about a year ago a little over a year

00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:06,880
ago we released the issue credit system

00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:09,340
which is a way to track who's

00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:11,530
contributing code and you can attribute

00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:13,720
it to yourself as the person who did the

00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:17,350
work your employer perhaps it's an

00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:20,350
agency or your client someone you know

00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:23,140
you're building a site for and recently

00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:25,750
Drees and matthew chip from Lullaby came

00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:29,040
together study the data and what they

00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:31,600
found is that 69 percent of the

00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:36,430
contributions are now sponsored by a

00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:38,080
company and actually 21 percent of the

00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:40,840
contributions are sponsored by these

00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:43,180
thirty companies and I love that it's

00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:46,270
very diverse in who's helping to sponsor

00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:49,000
out of this list you have agencies like

00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:51,370
MD systems and dicen you've got

00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:55,030
technology companies like Acquia and

00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:59,140
lingotek and in the end users like

00:05:55,030 --> 00:06:00,910
Pfizer and examiner and what I think is

00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:03,160
special about this data is that every

00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:05,140
data point is just another story of

00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:10,570
someone choosing to invest their time

00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:15,700
and money to make Drupal great and so I

00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:17,350
want you know in my role to really make

00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:20,110
sure that we have more of these stories

00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:21,580
and more collaboration and so as I

00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:24,040
stepped into this role the question I

00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:25,510
asked myself was how do we do this how

00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:29,230
do how do we keep this going how do we

00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:32,380
help Drupal thrive and I believe the

00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:34,600
answer is we need to help everyone's

00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:36,370
Drupal journey be as easy and smooth as

00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:38,550
possible

00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:41,560
every journey starts with a single step

00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:43,389
and I've kind of simplified this but I

00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:45,669
believe that you step into Drupal in one

00:06:43,389 --> 00:06:47,470
of two ways you step in either as a

00:06:45,669 --> 00:06:49,449
contributor in the contribution journey

00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:53,320
and you're someone who is contributing

00:06:49,449 --> 00:06:55,570
code or documentation and then we can

00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:57,850
release that out to those that are going

00:06:55,570 --> 00:07:00,190
to step in to the adoption journey and

00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:03,010
they are the ones that are evaluating

00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:05,440
Drupal for their business and both

00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:09,250
journeys need to be strong they need to

00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:10,990
be great and that happens by the Drupal

00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:13,300
Association partnering with the

00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:15,610
community to make that happen and the

00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:16,960
community is doing a fantastic job man

00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:19,720
you just saw out of the pre note they

00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:21,340
kind of described it there on the

00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:23,860
contribution journey side you have

00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:25,510
mentors you have camp organizers you

00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:28,449
have people helping with documentation

00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:30,250
project maintainer and then on the

00:07:28,449 --> 00:07:33,820
adoption side you have businesses all

00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:36,220
over the globe that are promoting Drupal

00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:38,380
into their local markets creating all

00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:41,770
kinds of great content and testimonials

00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:44,370
and case studies and and so they're

00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:47,139
doing a fantastic job and I wanted to

00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:49,450
see what the associations really tuned

00:07:47,139 --> 00:07:50,710
in this partnership and there's several

00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:53,080
things that we're doing but primarily

00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:57,930
we're helping on both sides of these

00:07:53,080 --> 00:08:01,180
journeys with Drupal con and drupal.org

00:07:57,930 --> 00:08:02,590
and you know as I started to this new

00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:04,990
role I wanted to make sure we were the

00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:08,500
best partners we possibly could be and I

00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:10,330
wanted to do little research just to see

00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,590
how we are doing and I'll continue to do

00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:14,560
this and I'll be reaching out to you for

00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:16,150
feedback as well but let me show you

00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,849
some of my findings let me talk a little

00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:22,330
bit about the contribution journey in

00:08:18,849 --> 00:08:25,720
the let me just start by saying I'm a

00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:27,460
economics business major so I have not

00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:29,320
done a lot of contribution I'm

00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:32,440
definitely the newb that you might have

00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:33,849
seen in the prenup and so I've spent a

00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:35,650
lot of time creating the programs to

00:08:33,849 --> 00:08:38,289
help you contribute so this is you know

00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:41,409
a good user experience to see how the

00:08:38,289 --> 00:08:44,050
whole journey works and well in short it

00:08:41,409 --> 00:08:46,329
pretty much went like this for four

00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:48,459
hours I just sat there a little

00:08:46,329 --> 00:08:49,060
perplexed but thank God angie was there

00:08:48,459 --> 00:08:51,430
to help me

00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:52,750
- I'd say raise your hand if you're

00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:56,460
contributing for the first time this

00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:58,090
week is anyone planning to contribute

00:08:56,460 --> 00:09:00,790
excellent okay

00:08:58,090 --> 00:09:03,279
learn from me make sure you set up your

00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:05,370
environment in advance and go see the

00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:08,260
mentors it'll save you many many hours

00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:10,870
but as I got going it got a little bit

00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:13,150
better now Mon drupal.org and I got to

00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:15,130
work with Angie on my issues and the

00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:18,190
issue queue I had to download composer

00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:21,580
and I got to roll my patch I submitted

00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:22,120
it to Drupal CIO that tested it that

00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:25,150
went well

00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:27,040
I submitted it Peter will Lannon failed

00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:30,520
it when he reviewed it so I had to go

00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:33,130
through the whole process again anyhow I

00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:35,920
had to learn you know how to use all the

00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:39,220
right tools and in the end it was a

00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:44,320
Eureka moment I mean it was pure joy yes

00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:47,830
thank you I had to thank the people who

00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:50,380
helped me and it was it was a Eureka

00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:52,210
moment it was pure joy and I just felt

00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:55,360
like I was one of you I felt really

00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:56,980
accomplished and I really want everyone

00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:00,580
to be able to feel this feeling that I

00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:02,170
had and also I learned so much I mean

00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:03,460
the main thing and this is kind of

00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:06,010
highlighting the pre-notice it takes a

00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:07,660
village you know it took Michael Hess to

00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:10,690
organize a summit

00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:13,480
it took University of Michigan to pay

00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:15,790
for that summit we had Angie who was

00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:18,910
mentoring me and then Kathy and Peter

00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:20,980
who reviewed my patch

00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:23,470
we had Matthew Radcliffe there who was

00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:25,810
my cheerleader which is a very important

00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:28,480
role you do need that cheerleader anyhow

00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:30,520
so you know it does take a village and I

00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:33,100
also realized exactly where the

00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:35,050
Association helps in that journey with

00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:36,970
all the tooling and really had a good

00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:39,820
feel for what that experience is like

00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:42,430
and it's important to me that we get as

00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:44,440
many people to feel comfortable in that

00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:46,720
journey and we need to make sure that

00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:49,839
drupal.org is always on it's highly

00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:51,610
performant we need to make sure our

00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:54,430
tools are the best that they can be for

00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:56,040
you and I'm really happy that we're

00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:58,500
getting ready to

00:10:56,040 --> 00:11:00,360
move composure to stable soon we've been

00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:02,130
working on documentation to make it

00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:06,060
easier for people to contribute their

00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:08,190
and we were supporting the maintainer of

00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:10,649
drede deters so that it's available this

00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:13,800
week and we're just looking for lots of

00:11:10,649 --> 00:11:15,600
other ways that we can help one thing

00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:17,639
that we're doing is we have a technical

00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:20,130
advisory committee that's assessing our

00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:22,230
tools to see how else we can improve

00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:24,269
that and then we'll be coming out to the

00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:26,069
community with more ideas on that and

00:11:24,269 --> 00:11:28,470
getting more feedback so some of the

00:11:26,069 --> 00:11:29,790
things you can look forward to and then

00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:30,690
lastly we're just looking at the issue

00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:34,709
Credit System

00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:35,880
right now it is looking at code but we

00:11:34,709 --> 00:11:37,470
also want to look at other ways people

00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:39,569
are contributing to make sure you're

00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:43,110
getting credit for

00:11:39,569 --> 00:11:44,370
maybe it's organizing camps or mentoring

00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:46,860
there's I mean there's just so many

00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:49,920
things that we can start giving people

00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:53,029
some recognition for and then of course

00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:55,019
Drupal con is a great tool for

00:11:53,029 --> 00:11:56,250
supporting the contribution charity I

00:11:55,019 --> 00:11:58,470
mean really just getting this all

00:11:56,250 --> 00:12:01,199
together to create these bonds so that

00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:02,670
we're faces and we have these solid

00:12:01,199 --> 00:12:05,699
relationships that we can take with us

00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:07,410
when we go back home but we always make

00:12:05,699 --> 00:12:09,089
sure to connect you with mentors that

00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:11,519
can help you get ready for the sprints

00:12:09,089 --> 00:12:13,889
we have seven sprints throughout the

00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:15,240
week we have core conversations that you

00:12:13,889 --> 00:12:17,540
can attend if you want to be in the

00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:20,160
conversation that advances the project

00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:22,680
and so much more

00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:24,209
this event is such a big part of just

00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:29,670
supporting all of you and your

00:12:24,209 --> 00:12:31,260
contribution journey so that is the

00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:33,209
contribution side I just want to talk a

00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:36,839
little bit about the adoption side and

00:12:33,209 --> 00:12:38,040
it's not one we talk about too often in

00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:39,360
a lot of it's because we have been

00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:40,709
focusing so much and helping to get

00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,449
Drupal 8 out the door we've been

00:12:40,709 --> 00:12:46,290
focusing a lot on the contribution side

00:12:42,449 --> 00:12:47,790
over the years and so this summer I did

00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:50,279
a lot of research and I talked to tons

00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:52,500
of customers I wanted to understand how

00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:54,449
they chose Drupal why they chose Drupal

00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:56,490
just so I can understand how we can

00:12:54,449 --> 00:12:58,199
support the community and getting more

00:12:56,490 --> 00:13:00,779
customers into their adoption journey

00:12:58,199 --> 00:13:02,459
and there was a theme that came up that

00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:05,430
I just wanted to share with you and that

00:13:02,459 --> 00:13:08,640
was I talked to several companies that

00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:12,480
have been using a proprietary CMS

00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:14,970
and that vendor decided to sunset that

00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:18,420
product and they gave their clients only

00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:20,100
six months to find a new CMS and migrate

00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:22,620
everything over which as you could

00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:24,120
imagine that's really stressful and many

00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:26,220
of them said well because of that

00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:28,350
experience I'm going with open source

00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:30,300
I don't want vendor lock-in and then

00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:32,670
when they started to choose Drupal what

00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:35,550
they said was yeah I chose Drupal for

00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:38,519
the features but what I was also

00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:41,100
choosing I was facing this off of the

00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:42,899
people behind the project because I saw

00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:44,910
how passionate they were and how

00:13:42,899 --> 00:13:46,320
committed they were to the project and I

00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:49,529
knew that this was something that was

00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:51,000
future-proof for me and so I just wanted

00:13:49,529 --> 00:13:53,310
to share that with you just so that you

00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,079
know that people are not just choosing

00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:57,240
Drupal but that you're very special and

00:13:55,079 --> 00:14:01,440
that they're choosing their decisions

00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:02,820
based on what you're doing together so

00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:06,060
the other thing that I learned with all

00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:08,579
of our research is that you know these

00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:11,370
end users out there they are finding the

00:14:08,579 --> 00:14:12,329
information that they need they're

00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:13,649
finding it through the different

00:14:12,329 --> 00:14:15,089
companies out there whether it's

00:14:13,649 --> 00:14:18,899
analysts reports that they're putting

00:14:15,089 --> 00:14:20,519
out or whether it is you know the

00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:21,990
testimonials and the case studies and

00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:24,990
they can pick up a phone and talk to an

00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:27,060
agency in their area but they say when

00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:28,949
they go to drupal.org they cannot find

00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:31,199
the information that they need and so

00:14:28,949 --> 00:14:33,329
they have to go elsewhere to find it so

00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:35,490
that's an area in this partnership where

00:14:33,329 --> 00:14:38,550
we can improve and in fact we already

00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:41,100
are right before Drupal con we launched

00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:43,410
a new design for the front page which is

00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:45,390
where the evaluators go and it is

00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:48,360
designed for the technical evaluator and

00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:50,730
we want it to inspire and inform them

00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:53,040
and connect them with agencies so they

00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:54,779
can continue their journey and talk to

00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:58,170
some of you that can help answer their

00:14:54,779 --> 00:15:01,079
questions so we're gonna be iterating on

00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:03,060
this and you'll start seeing some

00:15:01,079 --> 00:15:04,920
industry pages and different things that

00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:06,959
we're hearing that the Drupal shops

00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:08,610
would like as air coverage for

00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:10,440
themselves and tools that they can use

00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:12,269
and we'll be talking with more customers

00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:15,420
to make sure that we're providing

00:15:12,269 --> 00:15:18,630
information that actually helps them and

00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:20,880
then of course Drupal con is a great way

00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:21,550
to support the adoption journey so many

00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,680
company

00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:25,720
we'll adopt Drupal and then they need

00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:27,910
training so they can come here and we

00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:29,680
have all kinds of trainings and sessions

00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:31,960
they could meet the people who are

00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:34,570
building the software and even more

00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:36,670
importantly Drupal cons a great way for

00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:38,350
them to take that first step into the

00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:41,830
contribution journey and kind of

00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:43,450
complete the whole life cycle so we're

00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:46,000
going to be looking you know and always

00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:49,720
making Drupal con just really kind of a

00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:53,170
place to bring you all together and help

00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:54,880
everyone through all their journeys so

00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:57,550
those are that's what we're focusing on

00:15:54,880 --> 00:16:00,310
right now and I think it's a great place

00:15:57,550 --> 00:16:02,440
to start we're in a new era really with

00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:03,640
Drupal 8 out the door and so you'll hear

00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:05,290
me reaching out to the community to

00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:08,290
start asking what else you need I

00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:10,960
definitely want to hear from you but

00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:13,270
please know that both I and all of the

00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:15,250

00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:17,350
motivated to be the best partner we can

00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:18,730
and helping Drupal thrive and that's

00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:21,130
because of you

00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:24,640

picture together after Dre's Jesus

keynote I'm sure most of you have found

00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:08,850
the Wi-Fi by now and if not here's some

00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:11,160
some clues of how to find it and coffee

00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:13,350
I know how important coffee is for this

00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:15,810
event and so the team is made sure that

00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:18,030
we have coffee at different breaks we

00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:20,310
have free coffee we also have some paid

00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:22,410
coffee but I wanted to do a special

00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:24,420
shout out to commerce guys for helping

00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:31,860
to sponsor the coffee so we can provide

00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:34,680
it for you throughout the day and we

00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:35,730
also want you well-fed too we have

00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:39,510
something a little different this year

00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:41,760
the lunch is two hours long and that's

00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:44,490
because you can either go to a session

00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:47,670
or a buff and go to lunch or vice versa

00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:49,680
so just check the schedule see which

00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:52,170
session you want to go to and you have

00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:54,660
some options to see if you're vegetarian

00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:56,430
or you have a gluten free meal go ahead

00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:57,930
into the buffet line but if you have a

00:17:56,430 --> 00:18:00,860
special meal then you want to go to the

00:17:57,930 --> 00:18:03,240
nutrition nutritional information desk

00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:05,370
and again I just want to do another

00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:09,230
shout out to psych round who's helped

00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:09,230

event we could not have this event

00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:20,860
without them they're all so incredibly

00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:24,309
knowledgeable great way to learn more

00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:26,280
about Drupal and about the services for

00:21:24,309 --> 00:21:29,830
you and I want to thank our supporters

00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:33,940
so our supporters help underwrite our

00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:35,440
work on drupal.org and so I'm just so

00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:38,620
happy to see that program growing over

00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:40,750
the years so thank you and without any

00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:42,910
further ado I would like to introduce

00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:46,440
drew Gorton director of community and

00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:46,440
agency outreach from pantheon

00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:58,700
good morning - pecan yes Thank You Megan

00:21:57,230 --> 00:21:59,900
I'm drew Gorton with Pantheon and if

00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:01,160
you're not familiar with Pantheon if you

00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:02,929
haven't checked this out in a while come

00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:05,179
down see what we've got we've got a

00:22:02,929 --> 00:22:07,309
booth all week doing demos and such a

00:22:05,179 --> 00:22:09,320
lot of value for everybody in this room

00:22:07,309 --> 00:22:11,740
really you know Drupal we have a saying

00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:14,410
come for the code stay for the community

00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:18,289
and it's really pretty curious saying

00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:20,000
are we code or are we a community of

00:22:18,289 --> 00:22:23,270
people that are able to produce code and

00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:25,820
iterate it and move it forward I think

00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:27,770
that question sounds to me a lot like

00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:29,900
are we kinetic energy or are we

00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:32,419
potential energy and I think a lot of

00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:35,210
that has to do with the future and

00:22:32,419 --> 00:22:36,950
that's its own sort of big topic and if

00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:38,270
you're interested in that and where we

00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:39,799
all may be headed out that's something

00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:42,049
I'm gonna be talking about later later

00:22:39,799 --> 00:22:44,330
today and you're welcome to join but

00:22:42,049 --> 00:22:45,860
come for the code stay for the community

00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:48,770
certainly disguised my own experience as

00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:51,620
well I first came for the code of Drupal

00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:52,490
a long long time ago and and then I had

00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:54,710
a chance to interact with the community

00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:56,450
an event much like this Drupal con

00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:58,520
Boston that happened to be in 2008

00:22:56,450 --> 00:23:06,230
I'm curious was anybody else here for

00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:08,120
Boston whoo cool so I want everybody to

00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:09,679
know that wherever you are in that

00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:11,600
spectrum right now whether you're here

00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:14,870
for the code or the community or some

00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:17,570
mix of both that you're welcome here

00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:19,250
this is a fantastic community you're

00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:22,580
welcome to Drupal and you're welcome to

00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:24,230
Drupal con all communities have special

00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:26,030
stories and traditions and events and

00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:28,159
Rubicon's a little bit of that for all

00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:30,260
three of those things for us it's a time

00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:33,320
for us to come together to work on

00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:35,539
difficult problems to share stories

00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:36,590
create a few more celebrate our

00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:39,260
achievements and renew our many

00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:40,940
friendships and one of our finest

00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:42,770
traditions in Drupal con is our chance

00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:45,049
to hear from our benevolent founder

00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:48,640
Driss so please join me in welcoming our

00:23:45,049 --> 00:23:48,640
founder Driss to the stage

00:23:54,880 --> 00:24:00,860
awesome welcome everybody very excited

00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:03,620
to be here actually be talking about

00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:06,350
some of the things that are drew just

00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:08,120
mentioned I was in I was in Boston

00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:10,040
actually I drew book on Boston and I

00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:13,340
think this is my 28th to DrupalCon

00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:16,060
if you go back and counted that right so

00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:20,330
it's a significant number I would say

00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:21,800
all right so today I want to talk a

00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:24,640
little bit about three things I have two

00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:26,840
big themes let me try and go back

00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:29,780
genny's pretty simple but I want to talk

00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:31,820
a little bit about Drupal 8 and give you

00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:35,840
an update and then I also want to talk a

00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:38,420
little bit about the why why it is you

00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:43,670
know what we do and so let's start with

00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:45,620
Drupal 8 personally I continue to be

00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:47,990
really really excited about Drupal 8 I

00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:50,810
feel really really good about it at the

00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:53,450
same time and I talk to people some of

00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:56,360
you have some doubt about Drupal 8 or

00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:59,390
even the health of the project and I

00:24:56,360 --> 00:25:02,450
definitely you know want to recognize

00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:06,290
that and understand why there's a lot of

00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:08,900
changes in Drupal 8 it's our largest

00:25:06,290 --> 00:25:11,110
release probably our most important

00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:13,550
release in the history of the project

00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:15,830
and in a way it's very disruptive right

00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:17,410
all of these changes it's it's

00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:19,550
disruptive but it's also a very

00:25:17,410 --> 00:25:22,850
transformative time for our project

00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:26,000
where the things people do with Drupal 8

00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:28,370
and the people at rupal aid attract has

00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,920
created a lot of change or is creating a

00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:32,900
lot of change and I feel like these

00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:34,310
changes are propagating well let's write

00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:36,560
our community but they also have a ways

00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:40,310
to go and so when I say that I feel

00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:42,380
really good about Drupal 8 what that

00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:44,390
means is that I feel really good about

00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:46,490
the changes that we've made it doesn't

00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:48,920
mean that everything is perfect like

00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:51,710
they're still working towards porting

00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:55,400
more modules educating more people these

00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:59,180
kinds of things I do feel that we are on

00:25:55,400 --> 00:26:01,190
track when I when I spoke in Mikey you

00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:04,200
know drew popcorn knew or

00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:06,810
you know I said that Drupal 8 would get

00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:10,020
escape velocity at an image with a

00:26:06,810 --> 00:26:11,550
rockets taking off and I think what I

00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:14,880
said is that it would you know start to

00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:18,390
take off at the end of 2016 you know at

00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:21,930
the end of q4 and I still feel that we

00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:23,340
are on track to get there and so when I

00:26:21,930 --> 00:26:25,470
say I feel really good about Drupal it's

00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:29,280
because I feel like the changes we've

00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:31,380
made are really good I really feel good

00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:34,020
about these changes because they will

00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:37,050
ensure drupal's relevance for many many

00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:39,810
years to come and I think that's

00:26:37,050 --> 00:26:42,180
exciting and I hope that this week you

00:26:39,810 --> 00:26:44,700
all see that you all get a chance to

00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:47,400
learn that and also hope that this week

00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:49,860
we really use this week to advance the

00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:52,710
project you know to help people with

00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:56,970
Drupal 8 to help port modules these

00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:58,650
kinds of things since Drupal core New

00:26:56,970 --> 00:27:01,800
Orleans which is only like 4 months ago

00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:03,810
I think it's not that long ago we've

00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:05,550
actually made a lot of progress too and

00:27:03,810 --> 00:27:08,640
so I wanted to give you a quick update

00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:09,810
maybe spend 10 minutes to show you some

00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:12,210
of the things that have happened since

00:27:09,810 --> 00:27:15,240
we are actually on track to release

00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:21,750
Drupal 8 point to next week hopefully

00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:23,280
that will happen yeah and so I'll show

00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:25,260
you some of the things we've done here

00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:27,390
but here's a commit log and as you can

00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:30,150
see there's been a lot of improvements

00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:32,460
that have gone into just 8.2 these are

00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:35,250
improvements small and improvements

00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:37,250
large and obviously I can't talk about

00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:39,420
all of them there's just too much stuff

00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:42,120
but I do want to talk a little bit about

00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:44,480
some of the bigger things and I won't be

00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:47,820
able to talk about everything here but

00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:50,520
the first thing I wanted to show you is

00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:52,050
block placements and as you probably all

00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:54,000
know it's one of the most common things

00:27:52,050 --> 00:27:57,300
that people do in Drupal it's putting a

00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,950
block on a page and so let's take an

00:27:57,300 --> 00:28:01,470
example let's say you have this page and

00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:03,570
you want to insert this block it's the

00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:07,470
who is online block you know in the

00:28:03,570 --> 00:28:10,020
sidebar that was pretty complicated in

00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:13,200
Drupal 7 and is in fact still pretty

00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:14,430
complicated in Drupal 8.1 and so in

00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,890
Drupal 8.2

00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:18,870
we've made some changes to make that a

00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:20,700
lot easier and so I'm going to show you

00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:23,490
the before and the after

00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:26,310
alright so there before looks a little

00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:28,980
bit like this so first of all you have

00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:30,930
to go to the back ends an assuming that

00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:33,030
you found where to go which can be a

00:28:30,930 --> 00:28:35,700
real challenge on its own you get

00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:37,680
presented this wall of text with all of

00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:40,230
these things you have to learn that

00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:42,420
there is something called a region and

00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:44,250
then you have to you know you can go to

00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:45,360
this page and then you can visualize all

00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:47,310
the regions and then you have to

00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:50,130
memorize where all of these regions are

00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:53,070
then it can go back you can select the

00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:55,470
region place a block and so it's really

00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:59,670
a lot to ask from a users to do all of

00:28:55,470 --> 00:29:01,440
these steps at least I think so and then

00:28:59,670 --> 00:29:03,720
you place the block but there's no

00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:06,960
visual preview right you have to go back

00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:08,430
to the page to see where the block ended

00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:11,040
up and chances are if you did it wrong

00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:12,300
we did it right in this video but if the

00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:14,310
block is not in the right page you have

00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:17,910
to go all the way back and sort of start

00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:20,880
over the process and so in Drupal 8.2

00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:26,100
our upcoming release we change this to

00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:28,260
look like this so first of all you can

00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:30,810
click this place block link and what it

00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:33,000
does it visualizes the regions on the

00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:35,130
actual page so you can basically click

00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:37,410
on the page where you want the block to

00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:39,930
go you don't have to go to the back end

00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:41,490
you can just you know place the block

00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:45,390
right there don't no need to memorize

00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:47,370
things faster previews generally a lot

00:29:45,390 --> 00:29:56,150
less clicking around which will be

00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:58,530
vastly better for end-users pretty cool

00:29:56,150 --> 00:30:00,720
here's another thing just like placing a

00:29:58,530 --> 00:30:02,790
block on a page another thing which is

00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:05,370
extremely common is changing a menu

00:30:02,790 --> 00:30:08,700
right every page every website as a menu

00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:10,560
of some kind and so here is what we try

00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:15,090
to do so let's say we have this menu and

00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:18,990
we want to insert an About Us link so in

00:30:15,090 --> 00:30:22,320
Drupal 8.1 or before Drupal 8.1 it was

00:30:18,990 --> 00:30:24,480
kind of the same story there's no visual

00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:27,010
feedback you can see where you're

00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:29,980
working so if you move links up and down

00:30:27,010 --> 00:30:31,690
here do they go left or right it's hard

00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:34,570
to tell right and so you save it you

00:30:31,690 --> 00:30:35,680
have to go back to the main page to see

00:30:34,570 --> 00:30:39,640
that it actually worked

00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:42,160
and so with Drupal 8.2 one of the things

00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:45,760
we did is we introduced this concept of

00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:48,880
a setting straight just like the block

00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:52,120
please example the setting stray is what

00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:54,190
we call an outside in experience and an

00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:55,800
outside in experience what that means is

00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:59,080
that you can click anywhere on the page

00:30:55,800 --> 00:31:01,660
and you can figure it in place and

00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:04,090
immediately see the changes having an

00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:06,850
impact or you can see the changes take

00:31:04,090 --> 00:31:09,400
effect immediately and so that we change

00:31:06,850 --> 00:31:13,690
to look like this so this is still a

00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:14,860
work in progress but as you can see you

00:31:13,690 --> 00:31:18,310
know when you edit a menu

00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:20,530
this setting straight comes out and you

00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:23,650
can move things around and the next step

00:31:20,530 --> 00:31:25,570
would be to show these menu changes sort

00:31:23,650 --> 00:31:28,360
of in real time you can actually see

00:31:25,570 --> 00:31:30,490
that things change on the page life and

00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:32,740
that is great because it's gonna be much

00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:35,170
easier to learn you'll get this visual

00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:38,080
feedback for your clicks all of these

00:31:35,170 --> 00:31:40,330
things so this is a work in progress

00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:43,270
it's an alpha as you can see on the

00:31:40,330 --> 00:31:45,340
slide but I feel like we're really close

00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:49,090
with this to a major usability

00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:51,000
breakthrough and I get even more excited

00:31:49,090 --> 00:31:54,880
when I think how we can apply this

00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:57,220
settings tray as well as the outside-in

00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:59,500
pattern if you will the outside in

00:31:57,220 --> 00:32:01,360
thinking to other parts of Drupal

00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:04,030
including all of your contributed

00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:06,670
modules I think if we do that that could

00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:09,340
be a real game-changer in terms of

00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:11,290
usability so pretty excited about this

00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:16,840
setting straight and how you can all use

00:32:11,290 --> 00:32:19,510
it in your modules REST API improvements

00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:21,970
this is not new to Drupal or not new to

00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:25,420
Drupal 8 but we have continued to make a

00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:28,330
lot of progress on you know making our

00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:31,900
Web API or web service API s'more a bust

00:32:28,330 --> 00:32:33,910
and easier to use and so what I'd like

00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:36,040
to show you here is you know very

00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:38,710
minimal setups on the left you see a

00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:42,019
JavaScript application very minimal on

00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:45,019
the right you see Drupal 8 point

00:32:42,019 --> 00:32:46,820
and so they're talking to one another so

00:32:45,019 --> 00:32:49,880
first thing we can do is we can read

00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:53,330
data from Drupal 8.2 and then we can

00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:55,460
start updating it if we click on the

00:32:53,330 --> 00:32:58,220
update link it will actually send the

00:32:55,460 --> 00:33:00,080
updated content to Drupal and if your

00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:02,539
load a page you can see that it changed

00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:05,049
right similarly we can create new

00:33:02,539 --> 00:33:07,399
content so we're gonna start from this

00:33:05,049 --> 00:33:10,880
piece of content but we're changing the

00:33:07,399 --> 00:33:12,980
title creating a new body and then if we

00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:16,539
click create the content will be sent to

00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:19,940
Drupal and a new entity will be created

00:33:16,539 --> 00:33:21,289
similarly we can delete content and all

00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:24,259
of these things so obviously this is a

00:33:21,289 --> 00:33:26,480
very very simple demo but it shows that

00:33:24,259 --> 00:33:28,519
all of these things work and that they

00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:32,929
work pretty easily and I think this

00:33:28,519 --> 00:33:33,889
continues to be a very very big deal and

00:33:32,929 --> 00:33:36,769
if you think about what some

00:33:33,889 --> 00:33:39,379
organizations are doing with Drupal it's

00:33:36,769 --> 00:33:41,990
pretty remarkable so we see Drupal being

00:33:39,379 --> 00:33:45,980
used increasingly more to power digital

00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:48,470
kiosks so the New York subway system for

00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:50,990
example will be powering all of their

00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:52,789
screens like the screens that say next

00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:55,129
train arrives in two minutes

00:33:52,789 --> 00:33:58,850
they'll all be powered by Drupal which

00:33:55,129 --> 00:34:01,759
is pretty exciting Vodafone they have

00:33:58,850 --> 00:34:06,350
in-store kiosks you know these kiosks in

00:34:01,759 --> 00:34:08,950
the store you can go to today they

00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:11,780
basically have to download some files

00:34:08,950 --> 00:34:13,579
store them on a USB stick plug them into

00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:15,950
a laptop and every lot and for every

00:34:13,579 --> 00:34:18,050
kiosk you have a laptop so that's gonna

00:34:15,950 --> 00:34:21,619
change and they're gonna centrally

00:34:18,050 --> 00:34:23,720
manage all of this digital in-store

00:34:21,619 --> 00:34:25,879
kiosks from a central location using

00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:30,409
Drupal 8 very exciting because if

00:34:25,879 --> 00:34:31,940
thousands of stores across Europe lots

00:34:30,409 --> 00:34:34,669
of examples like that I mentioned

00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:37,010
Lufthansa previously Lufthansa is

00:34:34,669 --> 00:34:40,190
building their new you know on flight

00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:42,349
entertainment system to use Drupal 8 so

00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:44,869
this opens up a whole new world of use

00:34:42,349 --> 00:34:46,369
cases you know you know that allows

00:34:44,869 --> 00:34:48,950
people to do kind of new things

00:34:46,369 --> 00:34:50,300
obviously native apps continues to be

00:34:48,950 --> 00:34:52,550
really really important

00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:54,470
this helps with native apps decoupled

00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:56,510
applications which we've talked about

00:34:54,470 --> 00:34:58,400
a lot you can use your framework of

00:34:56,510 --> 00:35:00,740
choice and even things like voice

00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:02,690
assistance right where you can connect

00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:06,410
joopa wit and Amazon echo or Google

00:35:02,690 --> 00:35:09,470
Voice stuff like that really important

00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:12,470
because it allows us to take Drupal

00:35:09,470 --> 00:35:15,500
beyond the page it allows us to take

00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:18,260
Drupal into a whole new world of digital

00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:22,310
experiences and I think personally that

00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:24,140
that is very exciting another thing that

00:35:22,310 --> 00:35:27,530
we changed or made better in Drupal 8

00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:29,330
also not new but also a system that has

00:35:27,530 --> 00:35:33,800
seen continuous improvement in Drupal

00:35:29,330 --> 00:35:36,440
8.1 and 8.2 is the migration system and

00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:39,530
this is also key because what it allows

00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:42,859
you to do is to migrate from Drupal 600

00:35:39,530 --> 00:35:44,840
plus 7 to Drupal 8 but also to migrate

00:35:42,859 --> 00:35:47,270
from other platforms non Drupal

00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:50,510
environments to a drupal and to do that

00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:51,800
in a way that's relatively easy so

00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:53,720
that's pretty exciting I'm gonna show

00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:57,920
you how it works I'm gonna use my own

00:35:53,720 --> 00:36:02,359
site which is a Drupal 7 site and I'm

00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:04,940
gonna migrate it to Drupal 8.2 sites and

00:36:02,359 --> 00:36:07,609
as you can see this is an empty Drupal

00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:09,710
8.2 site and this is a little bit new

00:36:07,609 --> 00:36:11,960
and I'll come back to that in one second

00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:16,180
so what you need to do to migrate is

00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:16,180
pretty easy we provide a user interface

00:36:16,810 --> 00:36:22,190
where you basically enter your

00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:25,520
credentials you enter the credentials of

00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:28,310
the Drupal 7 database and when Troopa

00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:30,800
will do is it will migrate all of the

00:36:28,310 --> 00:36:34,130
content and the configuration from

00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:35,390
Drupal 7 into the Drupal 8 site and

00:36:34,130 --> 00:36:38,480
what's unique about that is that it

00:36:35,390 --> 00:36:41,390
leaves the Drupal 7 site intact that's

00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:43,849
kind of special because well for a

00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:47,240
couple of reasons one if something were

00:36:43,849 --> 00:36:49,300
to go wrong your Drupal 7 site is still

00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:51,950
up and running so that's kind of easy

00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:54,080
and also it's nice about it is that it

00:36:51,950 --> 00:36:56,390
doesn't migrate any of the legacy

00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:58,369
content you know like some old crusty

00:36:56,390 --> 00:37:02,480
tables will not be migrated into the new

00:36:58,369 --> 00:37:05,480
site which is kind of a bonus process

00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:07,880
takes all the ref time but once the

00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:08,400
migration completed you can see that all

00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:11,430
of the

00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:14,210
and is in my triple 8.2 site the site is

00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:19,020
no longer empty and I can start using it

00:37:14,210 --> 00:37:21,870
stuff like that obviously I would still

00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:25,020
need to see my site that's that's a work

00:37:21,870 --> 00:37:30,690
in progress not the best theme or in the

00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:37,350
world migration works and it's pretty

00:37:30,690 --> 00:37:39,840
easy at least for my sites it's also

00:37:37,350 --> 00:37:42,210
nice about all of these things is that

00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:43,380
they're actually well I wish first of

00:37:42,210 --> 00:37:45,330
all I wish I could show more things

00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:48,140
there's other key things in Drupal 8.2

00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:50,160
like the work on on workflows and

00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:52,260
competent moderation and things like

00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:53,760
that I hope to cover these in the next

00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:55,500
keynotes

00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:57,030
oh it's nice about these things that

00:37:55,500 --> 00:38:01,350
I've shown you is that they actually map

00:37:57,030 --> 00:38:03,690
on to the strategic initiatives that you

00:38:01,350 --> 00:38:06,270
know we talked about Drupal con New

00:38:03,690 --> 00:38:07,260
Orleans and so the point really I'm not

00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:09,030
going to talk about each of these

00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:11,150
initiatives in detail but the point is

00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:13,980
that we've you know made steady progress

00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:16,740
against these and just as a reminder

00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:19,680
these initiatives were picked based on

00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:21,930
survey data you know it's the community

00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:23,310
that kind of voted on what to work on

00:38:21,930 --> 00:38:27,440
and and so I think we're making good

00:38:23,310 --> 00:38:27,440
progress moving these things forward

00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:34,830
lots of other changes as I mentioned I

00:38:32,090 --> 00:38:36,780
recommend that you check out the release

00:38:34,830 --> 00:38:38,730
notes of the betas and things like that

00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:43,230
to learn about all of the things that

00:38:38,730 --> 00:38:44,940
have changed so this is actually pretty

00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:47,310
remarkable for people that have lived

00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:48,990
through multiple release cycles that's a

00:38:47,310 --> 00:38:50,430
lot of progress for us in just four

00:38:48,990 --> 00:38:53,760
months it's not something that we've

00:38:50,430 --> 00:38:55,350
ever done before right and so how did we

00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:59,340
do this so I want to talk a little bit

00:38:55,350 --> 00:39:01,410
about that as well so we've made a

00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:05,370
number of changes first of all we

00:39:01,410 --> 00:39:07,650
decided to do scheduled releases so we

00:39:05,370 --> 00:39:09,720
want to release a new version of Drupal

00:39:07,650 --> 00:39:11,850
8 roughly every 6 months

00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:14,370
and so far we've done a really great job

00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:18,030
doing so like we have released those on

00:39:14,370 --> 00:39:20,050
time as promised so big change from

00:39:18,030 --> 00:39:21,760
Drupal 8

00:39:20,050 --> 00:39:23,950
we've also adopted something called

00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:26,860
semantic versioning and this allows us

00:39:23,950 --> 00:39:29,380
to add new features and have an easy

00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:31,750
upgrade path effectively so we can add

00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:34,630
these new things without expensive

00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:37,030
upgrades and last but not least we have

00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:38,200
this notion of experimental modules and

00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:40,000
I don't think we've talked a lot about

00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:41,410
that so I'm gonna talk a little bit more

00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,110
about the experimental modules because

00:39:41,410 --> 00:39:47,740
we have talked about semantic versioning

00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:50,740
and we have to activate scheduled

00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:52,390
releases and so experimental modules are

00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:55,480
actually very interesting because they

00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:58,930
provide a path for new ideas for new

00:39:55,480 --> 00:40:01,720
modules to get into core and so when we

00:39:58,930 --> 00:40:04,180
add an experiment experimental module to

00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:06,130
Drupal 8 it enters this alpha which

00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:08,560
basically means use at your own risk as

00:40:06,130 --> 00:40:10,780
the name would imply and then they have

00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:13,270
to mature to be stable modules at which

00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:15,460
point we encourage them to be used quite

00:40:13,270 --> 00:40:18,070
you know widely used and it will support

00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:21,040
them and so some of the things that I

00:40:18,070 --> 00:40:24,160
show you are actually experimental

00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:26,500
modules they're in different stages as

00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:28,600
you can see on the slides and so what we

00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:32,290
have to do next is to move them to be

00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:34,380
stable and generally speaking these

00:40:32,290 --> 00:40:36,790
experimental modules have about one year

00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:38,980
to get stable and if they don't get

00:40:36,790 --> 00:40:41,310
stable within one year we will seriously

00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:43,540
consider removing them from core again

00:40:41,310 --> 00:40:45,490
all right and so some of the modules

00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:47,920
have been experimental for a little bit

00:40:45,490 --> 00:40:50,620
longer than others I'm are just like big

00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:55,450
pipe and in line form errors they have

00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:58,060
to get stable by 8.3 so not by 8.2 / 8.3

00:40:55,450 --> 00:41:03,040
and so we really need your help to get

00:40:58,060 --> 00:41:06,340
these modules over the finish line all

00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:08,950
right so please come to the sprints you

00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:10,570
can help with those so some of you might

00:41:08,950 --> 00:41:12,760
wonder like alright so you know if

00:41:10,570 --> 00:41:14,770
that's how it works how do i how do I

00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:17,260
get into this process right and so we

00:41:14,770 --> 00:41:20,470
created a process to go from ideas to

00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:22,960
experimental modules I'm not gonna talk

00:41:20,470 --> 00:41:25,270
about the process in this keynote just

00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:28,300
knowing that we are working and we have

00:41:25,270 --> 00:41:30,570
a process what I did want to do is show

00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:32,430
me a few of the ideas that you know

00:41:30,570 --> 00:41:35,310
could turn into experimental module so

00:41:32,430 --> 00:41:38,700
it's maybe a preview for what could be

00:41:35,310 --> 00:41:41,430
potentially go into 8.3 and you know

00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:43,740
areas that you can help with as well and

00:41:41,430 --> 00:41:45,840
again it's not an exclusive list of

00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:48,300
ideas but one of the things we're

00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:52,440
talking about right now is the the idea

00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:54,780
of default content and default content

00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:57,600
really helps new people people that are

00:41:54,780 --> 00:42:00,960
exploring Drupal to learn Drupal

00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:02,790
usability studies have shown this you

00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:06,030
know these kinds of things really really

00:42:02,790 --> 00:42:08,220
help and probably not a surprise because

00:42:06,030 --> 00:42:11,540
default content makes Drupal more you

00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:15,660
know dimmable it's easier to demo Drupal

00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:17,580
we're also thinking about using the the

00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:20,130
settings straight and in different parts

00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:21,570
of Drupal like for example use the

00:42:20,130 --> 00:42:24,150
settings straight to make it easy for

00:42:21,570 --> 00:42:29,520
people to switch between page layouts

00:42:24,150 --> 00:42:32,490
the media initiative and immediate team

00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:34,890
are working hard on prototypes and

00:42:32,490 --> 00:42:36,690
building foundational modules to build

00:42:34,890 --> 00:42:39,360
things like the media library which

00:42:36,690 --> 00:42:42,000
would allow you to select different

00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:44,750
images or different assets and to embed

00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:48,270
them in posts but also to upload

00:42:44,750 --> 00:42:53,610
different assets do Drupal looks pretty

00:42:48,270 --> 00:42:55,650
cool feel the outs this may be a little

00:42:53,610 --> 00:42:57,780
bit newer for some of you but it's kind

00:42:55,650 --> 00:43:02,550
of an interesting idea so let's say you

00:42:57,780 --> 00:43:04,800
have a content type that has an image

00:43:02,550 --> 00:43:06,720
field like you can see here the image

00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:10,260
field is currently shown at the bottom

00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:11,910
of the content but what if you wanted to

00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:13,590
show it somewhere else but if you wanted

00:43:11,910 --> 00:43:17,670
to move the image to the right well

00:43:13,590 --> 00:43:20,100
today involves theming but with this

00:43:17,670 --> 00:43:22,830
concept of field layouts or content type

00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:25,080
layouts it would be different so we have

00:43:22,830 --> 00:43:26,670
this notion of layouts you can select

00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:28,980
the different layouts for a content type

00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:30,420
like in this case two column layouts and

00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:33,060
so there would be a left and a right

00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:37,920
region and so what we can do is we can

00:43:33,060 --> 00:43:42,600
move the image to the right you know

00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:44,180
area and fuel and then we save it and it

00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:48,880
updates all of the

00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:52,160
posts with of that content type so

00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:54,530
another idea is refresh this and it

00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:56,750
basically removes the flicker that you

00:43:54,530 --> 00:43:59,359
see when you switch between different

00:43:56,750 --> 00:44:01,670
pages that's pretty interesting because

00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:03,740
it makes Drupal more application like

00:44:01,670 --> 00:44:07,280
and it allows us to close some of the

00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:09,619
user experience gap between websites and

00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:11,390
native applications so there's a module

00:44:09,619 --> 00:44:13,670
for that right now called refresh lists

00:44:11,390 --> 00:44:20,800
then obviously we would love to get your

00:44:13,670 --> 00:44:22,819
ideas as well so so this combination of

00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:25,540
scheduled release the semantic

00:44:22,819 --> 00:44:30,200
versioning and experimental modules I

00:44:25,540 --> 00:44:33,220
believe are a huge improvement right it

00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:36,230
allows us to do new releases frequently

00:44:33,220 --> 00:44:38,290
at new features provide an upgrade path

00:44:36,230 --> 00:44:40,970
that is easy and do a lot more

00:44:38,290 --> 00:44:43,819
experimentation so it's gonna change at

00:44:40,970 --> 00:44:46,099
the game I really do believe it's gonna

00:44:43,819 --> 00:44:50,599
change the game for Drupal so very very

00:44:46,099 --> 00:44:54,220
excited about that all right so that's

00:44:50,599 --> 00:44:59,440
actually my quick update on Drupal 8

00:44:54,220 --> 00:44:59,440
what do you think of that so far yeah

00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:08,230
the work of many people as always I'm

00:45:05,230 --> 00:45:09,610
just here to show it to you but a lot of

00:45:08,230 --> 00:45:13,120
people have been involved with all of

00:45:09,610 --> 00:45:15,310
these bits as you can imagine and so I

00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:17,410
think these changes in Drupal 8 in

00:45:15,310 --> 00:45:20,680
general will be you know really really

00:45:17,410 --> 00:45:23,080
important for the success of Drupal and

00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:24,780
I truly believe it will keep Drupal

00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:27,220
relevant and you know more than relevant

00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:29,910
for many many years to come so that's

00:45:27,220 --> 00:45:34,150
what I'm excited about Drupal 8 you know

00:45:29,910 --> 00:45:36,430
but there is also another important

00:45:34,150 --> 00:45:39,700
factor which will be a key contributor

00:45:36,430 --> 00:45:42,400
to Drupal's long term success and so to

00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:45,310
me that's the why and so I wanted to

00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:47,710
start that conversation today or restart

00:45:45,310 --> 00:45:53,680
that conversation maybe and talk a

00:45:47,710 --> 00:45:57,310
little bit about that so this summer you

00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:58,780
know we went to Italy and I was

00:45:57,310 --> 00:46:01,510
interesting because there was a

00:45:58,780 --> 00:46:04,450
last-minute booking we both we booked at

00:46:01,510 --> 00:46:08,430
the week in advance at this lovely villa

00:46:04,450 --> 00:46:11,110
in Tuscany but there was no internet

00:46:08,430 --> 00:46:12,850
which is kind of a a change for me as

00:46:11,110 --> 00:46:15,520
somebody who likes to stay connected

00:46:12,850 --> 00:46:19,480
let's say having no internet for a week

00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:21,400
was somewhat challenging the flip side

00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:24,790
of that is that a lot of time next to

00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:28,240
the pool and it gave me a lot of time to

00:46:24,790 --> 00:46:31,210
think and to really reflect on 16 years

00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:34,600
or almost 16 years depending on when you

00:46:31,210 --> 00:46:36,190
start counting of Drupal and there's a

00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:39,970
couple of things that I realized the

00:46:36,190 --> 00:46:42,730
first one is that sort of my connection

00:46:39,970 --> 00:46:46,450
with Drupal has changed over the years

00:46:42,730 --> 00:46:49,630
and so when I started rupal and I won't

00:46:46,450 --> 00:46:52,960
go into the whole story and I started

00:46:49,630 --> 00:46:55,300
rupal I just wanted to build a website

00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:57,660
for myself you know to be used in my

00:46:55,300 --> 00:47:02,350
dorm as an Internet message board to

00:46:57,660 --> 00:47:05,410
exchange messages with my friends and at

00:47:02,350 --> 00:47:08,800
the time I was really passionate about

00:47:05,410 --> 00:47:11,170
the code right and so this is actually a

00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:13,740
quote from a blog post that I wrote and

00:47:11,170 --> 00:47:17,339
the blog post is 10 years old now

00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:19,529
and so you can read the quote that a

00:47:17,339 --> 00:47:22,200
couple of things that I think come out

00:47:19,529 --> 00:47:26,730
of that one in the early early days of

00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:29,430
Drupal I detailed vision of what I want

00:47:26,730 --> 00:47:30,690
to Drupal to be in terms of product like

00:47:29,430 --> 00:47:34,589
I wanted to have these features and

00:47:30,690 --> 00:47:36,539
these kinds of things and then from a

00:47:34,589 --> 00:47:39,599
technical point of view I was literally

00:47:36,539 --> 00:47:42,089
obsessed with the code I wanted the code

00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:44,940
to be pure I wanted the architecture to

00:47:42,089 --> 00:47:47,520
be perfect and for example I couldn't

00:47:44,940 --> 00:47:49,859
imagine keeping backwards-compatibility

00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:52,890
because to me that meant like dragging

00:47:49,859 --> 00:47:56,720
along old baggage and it wouldn't allow

00:47:52,890 --> 00:47:59,520
me to keep things imperfect and so

00:47:56,720 --> 00:48:01,650
obsessed with the codes and achieving

00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:06,000
sort of this precise vision of what I

00:48:01,650 --> 00:48:08,190
wanted rupal to be over the years that

00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:10,890
has changed as more and more people

00:48:08,190 --> 00:48:14,309
became involved with Drupal my focus had

00:48:10,890 --> 00:48:16,109
to shift and to at the shift from you

00:48:14,309 --> 00:48:18,299
know just working on the code to trying

00:48:16,109 --> 00:48:21,750
to grow our community helping to

00:48:18,299 --> 00:48:23,670
organize events I started the Drupal

00:48:21,750 --> 00:48:26,849
Association you know all of these things

00:48:23,670 --> 00:48:29,670
and so my role effectively evolved from

00:48:26,849 --> 00:48:32,220
just being focused on the code to

00:48:29,670 --> 00:48:35,279
becoming increasingly more focused on

00:48:32,220 --> 00:48:38,579
the people as well as a project and

00:48:35,279 --> 00:48:40,829
actually what I realized and it's very

00:48:38,579 --> 00:48:43,559
obvious probably but what I really

00:48:40,829 --> 00:48:45,779
realized is that I'm a lot less worried

00:48:43,559 --> 00:48:48,150
about the quality of the codes or

00:48:45,779 --> 00:48:50,279
achieving that perfect vision where

00:48:48,150 --> 00:48:52,770
jubal and I'm much more interested today

00:48:50,279 --> 00:48:55,500
in seeing how Drupal grows that the

00:48:52,770 --> 00:48:58,170
community is healthy and the impact that

00:48:55,500 --> 00:49:03,210
rupal has on different you know groups

00:48:58,170 --> 00:49:04,619
or people around the world right and so

00:49:03,210 --> 00:49:07,380
one of the things that I did when I was

00:49:04,619 --> 00:49:10,079
sitting next to the pool in Italy is I

00:49:07,380 --> 00:49:12,930
decided to make a list of sort of

00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:15,180
meaningful moments you know moments that

00:49:12,930 --> 00:49:18,990
I'll probably always remember for the

00:49:15,180 --> 00:49:21,539
rest of my life and so I became quite a

00:49:18,990 --> 00:49:23,549
long list actually there I started to

00:49:21,539 --> 00:49:26,250
group things in that list and there was

00:49:23,549 --> 00:49:28,080
a few patterns that I observe

00:49:26,250 --> 00:49:32,609
and so I wanna show you some of these

00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:35,099
patterns on that list and so one of the

00:49:32,609 --> 00:49:38,460
things on that list that was meaningful

00:49:35,099 --> 00:49:40,800
or gave me purpose is when you know

00:49:38,460 --> 00:49:42,900
people would come up to me and you know

00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:45,480
there's many people that have done this

00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:49,980
and would tell me how Drupal changed

00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:52,590
their life right and the examples range

00:49:49,980 --> 00:49:55,619
from hey you know you got me into

00:49:52,590 --> 00:49:59,670
programming and Drupal now provides me a

00:49:55,619 --> 00:50:01,500
full time job too you know Drupal now is

00:49:59,670 --> 00:50:03,510
my full-time business I have even a

00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:05,700
Drupal shop and all of these things and

00:50:03,510 --> 00:50:09,030
they're they're kind of amazing stories

00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:11,940
for me and so but I asked my team to do

00:50:09,030 --> 00:50:15,510
is to interview a few people like that

00:50:11,940 --> 00:50:17,599
and to create a few videos and to give

00:50:15,510 --> 00:50:20,160
you a taste of what these stories are

00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:22,349
the videos were edited for you know

00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:25,290
brevity because the thorough you know

00:50:22,349 --> 00:50:28,650
over long conversations and so I'm gonna

00:50:25,290 --> 00:50:31,290
show you a couple of these videos I'm

00:50:28,650 --> 00:50:33,750
from a small village in southern part of

00:50:31,290 --> 00:50:36,630
India now I work for Capgemini as a

00:50:33,750 --> 00:50:39,109
senior consultant it was in group oh

00:50:36,630 --> 00:50:42,690
maybe I may end up being like a small

00:50:39,109 --> 00:50:45,450
shop owner in Chennai you know or

00:50:42,690 --> 00:50:48,660
something like that if it was in rupal I

00:50:45,450 --> 00:50:51,680
think Drupal changed my life it is more

00:50:48,660 --> 00:50:55,500
of a thing that I can't live without

00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:58,410
drupal change the whole lifestyle or how

00:50:55,500 --> 00:51:00,480
as a man I am whatever I'm doing right

00:50:58,410 --> 00:51:02,670
now is because of Drupal definitely it's

00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:08,700
a game changer at least in artist on me

00:51:02,670 --> 00:51:11,400
I would definitely say that tuple

00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:14,010
changed my life and my career when I

00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:17,070
started to work as a project manager I

00:51:14,010 --> 00:51:18,780
wasn't really sure where it could lead

00:51:17,070 --> 00:51:21,900
I'm very lucky that I'm doing what I

00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:24,390
like I'm working with Drupal and I like

00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:27,690
to pull and I think it's a very good

00:51:24,390 --> 00:51:30,330
combination if I ask myself six years

00:51:27,690 --> 00:51:31,420
ago what I wanted to achieve I maybe

00:51:30,330 --> 00:51:33,490
wouldn't say it

00:51:31,420 --> 00:51:35,500
has to be something with Drupal but I

00:51:33,490 --> 00:51:38,109
would definitely say that feeling

00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:40,599
belonging somewhere and enjoying

00:51:38,109 --> 00:51:43,900
something so much that I would love to

00:51:40,599 --> 00:51:54,280
continue doing that as long as I can I I

00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:57,040
would definitely say that yeah so the

00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:59,559
stories of you know Vijay and Sophie are

00:51:57,040 --> 00:52:02,740
I think very powerful and you know it's

00:51:59,559 --> 00:52:04,180
overwhelming at times is you know that

00:52:02,740 --> 00:52:07,420
there's so many more of these stories

00:52:04,180 --> 00:52:10,059
you know and probably many of them we

00:52:07,420 --> 00:52:12,910
never know about and so that actually

00:52:10,059 --> 00:52:15,880
became clear a DrupalCon

00:52:12,910 --> 00:52:17,470
San Francisco when I asked in one of my

00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:19,119
you know it's you know please stand up

00:52:17,470 --> 00:52:21,220
in Drupal changed your life and what

00:52:19,119 --> 00:52:23,140
happened there is like 3,000 people or

00:52:21,220 --> 00:52:25,809
almost 3,000 people sit up and I

00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:28,809
remember being on Steam on stage I'm

00:52:25,809 --> 00:52:31,630
sorry been completely speechless I'm an

00:52:28,809 --> 00:52:33,369
goosebumps on stage and definitely

00:52:31,630 --> 00:52:37,599
something that I'll never forget for the

00:52:33,369 --> 00:52:39,940
rest of my life but that wasn't just it

00:52:37,599 --> 00:52:41,920
right it's it's amazing to see how

00:52:39,940 --> 00:52:44,740
Drupal has an impact on people in our

00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:48,130
community but some of the other items of

00:52:44,740 --> 00:52:49,540
my list were impact on people not in our

00:52:48,130 --> 00:52:52,569
community sort of people that were

00:52:49,540 --> 00:52:56,140
indirectly impacted by Drupal and one

00:52:52,569 --> 00:53:00,670
example which I'll show you is a Drupal

00:52:56,140 --> 00:53:02,790
con Portland in 2013 I believe and there

00:53:00,670 --> 00:53:05,880
what happened at the time is there was a

00:53:02,790 --> 00:53:08,589
very destructive tornado in Oklahoma

00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:10,900
which basically affected you know

00:53:08,589 --> 00:53:13,750
thousands of people I believe 37 people

00:53:10,900 --> 00:53:17,530
died hundreds of people were affected

00:53:13,750 --> 00:53:20,109
and people in the Drupal community came

00:53:17,530 --> 00:53:23,770
together to build a website to help

00:53:20,109 --> 00:53:25,059
those people that needed help and you

00:53:23,770 --> 00:53:27,400
know you're gonna remember walking into

00:53:25,059 --> 00:53:29,109
the sprint rooms after midnight and

00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:32,559
there's like hundreds of people you know

00:53:29,109 --> 00:53:34,900
building building these Drupal sites you

00:53:32,559 --> 00:53:37,059
know for these people affected by the

00:53:34,900 --> 00:53:40,210
tornado and so I found a video on

00:53:37,059 --> 00:53:42,579
YouTube from 2013 which going to show

00:53:40,210 --> 00:53:43,780
you a little snippet of hey everyone

00:53:42,579 --> 00:53:45,850
this is Stan I'm coming to you

00:53:43,780 --> 00:53:47,890
Lacombe Portland 2013 and something

00:53:45,850 --> 00:53:50,830
amazing is happening in the room behind

00:53:47,890 --> 00:53:52,690
me volunteers from FEMA and for the

00:53:50,830 --> 00:53:55,300
Drupal community have gotten together to

00:53:52,690 --> 00:53:58,480
work on a mobile accessible website

00:53:55,300 --> 00:54:01,060
where people can find rides and find

00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:02,470
housing in the devastated areas of

00:54:01,060 --> 00:54:03,010
Oklahoma that were just hit by the

00:54:02,470 --> 00:54:04,660
tornado

00:54:03,010 --> 00:54:06,520
people have split up into three

00:54:04,660 --> 00:54:08,710
different groups you've got some people

00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:22,210
who are worried about promoting the

00:54:08,710 --> 00:54:23,320
service promotion we wanted to make one

00:54:22,210 --> 00:54:26,620
of the ideas that makes things very

00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:27,970
textual okay low bandwidth you don't

00:54:26,620 --> 00:54:30,280
know what the infrastructure is gonna be

00:54:27,970 --> 00:54:32,500
like if people need to get information

00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:34,240
through SMS you want to make sure you

00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:37,000
can get it out through channels that are

00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:39,070
textual you've got people who are

00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:41,050
worried about the rideshare aspect of

00:54:39,070 --> 00:54:42,700
this service there are certain things

00:54:41,050 --> 00:54:44,170
that we're going to have to map like

00:54:42,700 --> 00:54:45,700
where they're coming from where they're

00:54:44,170 --> 00:54:50,020
going and coming at all they can fit in

00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:51,940
their bar but I think the actual route

00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:57,760
that they're taking is going to be

00:54:51,940 --> 00:55:01,240
difficulty and you've got people who are

00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:03,700
worried about the HomeShare aspect of

00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:07,870
this service so we boiled down to very

00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:10,540
very simple features basically talking

00:55:07,870 --> 00:55:12,910
about users with fields keeping things

00:55:10,540 --> 00:55:14,590
as basic as possible many folks will be

00:55:12,910 --> 00:55:17,520
working through the night and then

00:55:14,590 --> 00:55:17,520
another team will come in

00:55:20,630 --> 00:55:28,980
so yeah I think that was you know again

00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:30,780
something always to remember that so

00:55:28,980 --> 00:55:32,790
this is again just of many examples of

00:55:30,780 --> 00:55:34,080
how Drupal doesn't just impact people in

00:55:32,790 --> 00:55:36,990
the community but you know people

00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:39,270
outside of our community as well you

00:55:36,990 --> 00:55:42,270
know other items on my list were related

00:55:39,270 --> 00:55:44,910
to the open web for example and if you

00:55:42,270 --> 00:55:46,800
read my blog you know you may have

00:55:44,910 --> 00:55:50,340
noticed that in recent years have become

00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:52,860
much more passionate or concerns as well

00:55:50,340 --> 00:55:54,630
about the open web and and the rise of

00:55:52,860 --> 00:55:57,870
the walled gardens and what that means

00:55:54,630 --> 00:56:00,480
to you know to the future of the web

00:55:57,870 --> 00:56:02,670
I believe Drupal is very uniquely

00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:05,580
positioned to help preserve the open web

00:56:02,670 --> 00:56:09,420
and I also believe that that is

00:56:05,580 --> 00:56:12,300
critically important for you know that

00:56:09,420 --> 00:56:14,190
we we try to keep that intact for you

00:56:12,300 --> 00:56:16,620
know many generations to come if I think

00:56:14,190 --> 00:56:20,510
about the billions of people that have

00:56:16,620 --> 00:56:22,440
yet to come online or you know our

00:56:20,510 --> 00:56:24,120
grandchildren or you know however you

00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:27,000
want to think about it it would be great

00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:29,700
that they could experience the web as an

00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:31,820
open web right and I really do believe

00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:38,040
that Drupal can have a meaningful

00:56:31,820 --> 00:56:41,400
contribution to do that and so all of

00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:43,650
these examples like in my head I started

00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:46,320
to like organize them almost like you

00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:49,800
know radiating circles let's say I try

00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:52,770
to visualize it here where each circle

00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:54,480
reaches a bigger group of people so

00:56:52,770 --> 00:56:57,390
bigger and bigger groups of people and

00:56:54,480 --> 00:57:00,540
the impact that Drupal has on each of

00:56:57,390 --> 00:57:03,540
these groups gives me frankly purpose in

00:57:00,540 --> 00:57:05,400
one way or another and I think well all

00:57:03,540 --> 00:57:10,020
of these things have in common is that

00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:12,720
they are self transcendent what that

00:57:10,020 --> 00:57:16,320
means is that I personally get meaning

00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:19,500
when my work matters more to others and

00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:21,150
it matters to myself and that's also one

00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:22,560
of the reasons why I've been so

00:57:21,150 --> 00:57:25,290
passionate or became so passionate

00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:27,770
compared to the early days about things

00:57:25,290 --> 00:57:29,550
like usability internationalization

00:57:27,770 --> 00:57:31,710
accessibility you know all of these

00:57:29,550 --> 00:57:35,970
things and

00:57:31,710 --> 00:57:38,580
and I know it's not just me when I when

00:57:35,970 --> 00:57:40,800
we interviewed all of these people most

00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:43,050
of most of the people actually had the

00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:45,240
same feeling which which is obviously

00:57:43,050 --> 00:57:48,540
awesome and so I'll let them talk to

00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:50,760
that themselves back when migrate very

00:57:48,540 --> 00:57:53,970
much came out of a scratch my only H

00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:56,280
kind of situation that became the module

00:57:53,970 --> 00:57:58,410
at which I created for Drupal for seven

00:57:56,280 --> 00:58:00,300
I believe and then from there just kind

00:57:58,410 --> 00:58:02,370
of smell balled other people have the

00:58:00,300 --> 00:58:05,190
same need and they start requesting

00:58:02,370 --> 00:58:07,140
features features grew as a downloads

00:58:05,190 --> 00:58:09,120
came it has reached so I think over two

00:58:07,140 --> 00:58:12,330
million downloads turned from a meet I

00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:14,070
had to a need other people had and it's

00:58:12,330 --> 00:58:15,630
sort of fulfilled my need to build

00:58:14,070 --> 00:58:16,980
software for other people which has

00:58:15,630 --> 00:58:18,990
always been that great joy of mine

00:58:16,980 --> 00:58:21,240
that's been the main reward for me is to

00:58:18,990 --> 00:58:22,860
get the feedback from people people who

00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:24,030
liked it people who even people who

00:58:22,860 --> 00:58:26,100
don't just to see that people are using

00:58:24,030 --> 00:58:28,530
it to know that something I did I had a

00:58:26,100 --> 00:58:30,600
direct impact a lot of other people just

00:58:28,530 --> 00:58:32,670
usually rewarding to me and to meet

00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:34,230
people at conferences and to have to see

00:58:32,670 --> 00:58:35,730
their face when they you know find out

00:58:34,230 --> 00:58:38,250
that I built this back up in my grade

00:58:35,730 --> 00:58:39,960
and have them like spontaneously give

00:58:38,250 --> 00:58:40,770
you a hug when I take take a picture

00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:42,510
with here or something it's really

00:58:40,770 --> 00:58:44,430
pretty cool to see that something so

00:58:42,510 --> 00:58:50,340
simple can be so meaningful to other

00:58:44,430 --> 00:58:52,680
people I just want to use this period to

00:58:50,340 --> 00:58:54,720
be on Drupal to change the world and I

00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:57,330
think that Google is the best way for me

00:58:54,720 --> 00:59:00,450
to achieve of objective that our first

00:58:57,330 --> 00:59:03,720
is to fight against poverty because in

00:59:00,450 --> 00:59:07,100
my country the jobless is great transfer

00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:10,260
problem people don't have training and a

00:59:07,100 --> 00:59:13,980
capacity to do job so they prefer to go

00:59:10,260 --> 00:59:17,340
away to look for other thing in other

00:59:13,980 --> 00:59:20,280
countries so I see that and I with a

00:59:17,340 --> 00:59:24,240
habit change I have an opportunity in my

00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:26,820
opinion it's this you be better that we

00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:29,850
create a situation in our country in

00:59:26,820 --> 00:59:32,040
order to to let people stay here but

00:59:29,850 --> 00:59:32,610
also to give them a solution to their

00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:35,160
problem

00:59:32,610 --> 00:59:37,690
you can not say to people to stay even

00:59:35,160 --> 00:59:40,000
if you have no solution to keep their

00:59:37,690 --> 00:59:43,270
in order to bring them out of poverty

00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:46,210
and to permit them to go that is my

00:59:43,270 --> 00:59:49,480
motivation to tell to the young people

00:59:46,210 --> 00:59:52,270
in my country that we can turn them to

00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:54,880
give them a possibility to have a job

00:59:52,270 --> 00:59:57,760
and this will change their life and it

00:59:54,880 --> 01:00:01,240
will return them in amusing droop and

00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:04,360
they will have a way to find the earn

01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:10,330
their life this is my my kind of

01:00:04,360 --> 01:00:13,030
contribution to change work the chance

01:00:10,330 --> 01:00:14,470
to help the lives of others I really

01:00:13,030 --> 01:00:17,500
feel for me it's been about all about

01:00:14,470 --> 01:00:19,780
giving others the tools that they need

01:00:17,500 --> 01:00:21,310
in order to learn Drupal and be

01:00:19,780 --> 01:00:24,010
effective in it I get a lot out of

01:00:21,310 --> 01:00:25,960
knowing that I can help shape someone's

01:00:24,010 --> 01:00:28,030
initial experience with Drupal and set

01:00:25,960 --> 01:00:30,250
them up for a path of success and then

01:00:28,030 --> 01:00:32,050
hopefully continue that to share our

01:00:30,250 --> 01:00:34,000
insights and encourage others to do the

01:00:32,050 --> 01:00:35,440
same that's really a chance to reach out

01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:37,360
and improve the lives of human beings

01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:38,770
all over the place and in ways that you

01:00:37,360 --> 01:00:40,060
don't necessarily know especially when

01:00:38,770 --> 01:00:41,620
you're dealing in the distributed

01:00:40,060 --> 01:00:43,810
community be that code that you're

01:00:41,620 --> 01:00:46,810
writing or presentations you're giving

01:00:43,810 --> 01:00:48,850
and posted up on YouTube or slides or

01:00:46,810 --> 01:00:50,560
whatever you don't even know how many

01:00:48,850 --> 01:00:51,940
people you're effecting I've had people

01:00:50,560 --> 01:00:53,410
come back to me that I haven't done

01:00:51,940 --> 01:00:55,660
personally up until the point which they

01:00:53,410 --> 01:00:57,640
introduced themselves to me and had them

01:00:55,660 --> 01:00:59,470
saying wow that thing you wrote or that

01:00:57,640 --> 01:01:02,410
thing you did or that thing you produced

01:00:59,470 --> 01:01:03,850
or the thing you shared was amazing for

01:01:02,410 --> 01:01:05,380
me they gave me these opportunities

01:01:03,850 --> 01:01:08,140
because I was able to pick that up and

01:01:05,380 --> 01:01:12,640
use it myself those experiences stand

01:01:08,140 --> 01:01:14,910
out to me and have been just so so

01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:18,120
gratifying every time that happened

01:01:14,910 --> 01:01:18,120
there you go

01:01:20,550 --> 01:01:25,060
it's funny because I've now watch these

01:01:22,780 --> 01:01:27,610
videos like 10 times and it's still like

01:01:25,060 --> 01:01:30,640
it still you know makes me a little

01:01:27,610 --> 01:01:34,120
emotional actually they'll let the

01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:36,190
stories of Ronan and Frank and Drew as

01:01:34,120 --> 01:01:38,980
well as my own story I think have in

01:01:36,190 --> 01:01:42,250
common is that you know we find meaning

01:01:38,980 --> 01:01:45,190
when our work you know results in

01:01:42,250 --> 01:01:47,020
life-changing outcomes for others and I

01:01:45,190 --> 01:01:53,710
think that's a big theme here in all of

01:01:47,020 --> 01:01:55,600
these in all of these videos everybody

01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:58,030
knows about playing with dominoes but

01:01:55,600 --> 01:02:00,010
what you may not know is that a domino

01:01:58,030 --> 01:02:03,040
can knock over another Domino which is

01:02:00,010 --> 01:02:05,170
about one and a half times larger so

01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:07,660
what I have here is a chain of dominoes

01:02:05,170 --> 01:02:10,780
each one has one and a half times larger

01:02:07,660 --> 01:02:13,270
than the previous one and the smallest

01:02:10,780 --> 01:02:15,880
Domino is about five millimeters high

01:02:13,270 --> 01:02:18,900
and one millimeter stick and I will

01:02:15,880 --> 01:02:18,900
carefully place it

01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:28,460
and there are 13 Domino's and the

01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:33,760
largest Domino it weighs about a hundred

01:02:28,460 --> 01:02:33,760
pounds and it's more than a meter tall

01:02:37,550 --> 01:02:54,870
ready boom that was 13 Domino's if I had

01:02:51,840 --> 01:03:07,320
29 Domino's the last Domino would be as

01:02:54,870 --> 01:03:09,510
tall as the Empire State Building yeah

01:03:07,320 --> 01:03:12,300
it's pretty cool I think and for me when

01:03:09,510 --> 01:03:13,050
I saw this video on YouTube it reminded

01:03:12,300 --> 01:03:15,810
me of Drupal

01:03:13,050 --> 01:03:17,850
it really did so you know if you think

01:03:15,810 --> 01:03:19,860
about how a tiny little Domino that

01:03:17,850 --> 01:03:22,140
looks like this big could eventually tip

01:03:19,860 --> 01:03:24,660
over the Empire State Building I mean

01:03:22,140 --> 01:03:27,210
just imagine sort of the impact that

01:03:24,660 --> 01:03:30,600
ripple could have right like it's all

01:03:27,210 --> 01:03:36,930
about sort of making that happen let's

01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:43,770
say so where's that quote that's just

01:03:36,930 --> 01:03:47,390
something along the same lines so these

01:03:43,770 --> 01:03:49,800
were some of the moments of my list but

01:03:47,390 --> 01:03:51,840
there was also other moments for a

01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:53,100
second group if you will of moments that

01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:55,560
kind of gave me purpose

01:03:53,100 --> 01:03:59,130
that are not necessarily self

01:03:55,560 --> 01:04:02,790
transcendence and examples of that are

01:03:59,130 --> 01:04:05,820
for example in 2005 when our

01:04:02,790 --> 01:04:07,920
infrastructure crashed and we had to go

01:04:05,820 --> 01:04:10,230
raise money to buy a new server so we

01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:13,260
could keep the lights on that was

01:04:10,230 --> 01:04:15,000
incredibly painful and in many ways we

01:04:13,260 --> 01:04:19,230
were really close to losing everything

01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:23,820
you know if we had failed to raise money

01:04:19,230 --> 01:04:24,870
for a new server at the time you know so

01:04:23,820 --> 01:04:28,230
I would have happened to the Drupal

01:04:24,870 --> 01:04:29,670
community if you want to learn more

01:04:28,230 --> 01:04:31,430
about this story you should check out

01:04:29,670 --> 01:04:35,270
some of the older you know it's but

01:04:31,430 --> 01:04:37,790
another other moments on my list are

01:04:35,270 --> 01:04:41,550
moments where I had to ask individuals

01:04:37,790 --> 01:04:44,250
to leave the project quite frankly and

01:04:41,550 --> 01:04:47,010
these I can tell you these are not five

01:04:44,250 --> 01:04:50,279
moments because some of them are friends

01:04:47,010 --> 01:04:52,589
or people I've known for a long time

01:04:50,279 --> 01:04:55,259
I need to ask them to leave because

01:04:52,589 --> 01:04:57,240
their values or behaviors were we're not

01:04:55,259 --> 01:04:58,980
aligned with the values and the

01:04:57,240 --> 01:05:03,269
behaviors that we want to promote and

01:04:58,980 --> 01:05:05,579
that's really important right so yeah at

01:05:03,269 --> 01:05:07,529
the same time when I look back at these

01:05:05,579 --> 01:05:09,210
moments they were meaningful because you

01:05:07,529 --> 01:05:13,680
know now I feel like we did something

01:05:09,210 --> 01:05:16,730
for the greater good of the project you

01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:19,680
know for others in the project or even

01:05:16,730 --> 01:05:21,329
the developments of Drupal eight was on

01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:26,519
my list and it took four and a half

01:05:21,329 --> 01:05:28,470
years was a lot of hard work from many

01:05:26,519 --> 01:05:31,230
many people and there's many many

01:05:28,470 --> 01:05:34,349
stories of how people doubted our

01:05:31,230 --> 01:05:36,480
process or questions questions whether

01:05:34,349 --> 01:05:39,240
we were doing the right thing building

01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:42,749
the right features people got burned out

01:05:39,240 --> 01:05:44,880
in the process some people friends left

01:05:42,749 --> 01:05:47,940
a project during the Drupal 8

01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:51,240
development process because it was so

01:05:47,940 --> 01:05:55,289
hard and in that moment that wasn't fun

01:05:51,240 --> 01:05:56,999
I can tell you that wasn't fun but when

01:05:55,289 --> 01:05:59,180
we released Drupal 8 and we had the big

01:05:56,999 --> 01:06:01,319
release parties all around the world

01:05:59,180 --> 01:06:04,109
that was actually really meaningful to

01:06:01,319 --> 01:06:05,700
me and I felt like a real sense of

01:06:04,109 --> 01:06:08,369
accomplishment like you know we finally

01:06:05,700 --> 01:06:10,769
released it as I said earlier I really

01:06:08,369 --> 01:06:13,829
felt like we built something that would

01:06:10,769 --> 01:06:14,779
keep Drupal relevant you know for many

01:06:13,829 --> 01:06:17,430
many years to come

01:06:14,779 --> 01:06:20,519
and so but all of these examples these

01:06:17,430 --> 01:06:24,569
three examples have in common is that I

01:06:20,519 --> 01:06:27,480
think we find meaning in doing the hard

01:06:24,569 --> 01:06:29,700
work it's it's usually not a positive

01:06:27,480 --> 01:06:32,670
experiences that are meaningful right

01:06:29,700 --> 01:06:34,890
it's the ones that are hard and

01:06:32,670 --> 01:06:37,829
sometimes we may forget that and I think

01:06:34,890 --> 01:06:40,470
I think it's a good reminder for all of

01:06:37,829 --> 01:06:43,200
us that the hard moments the tough work

01:06:40,470 --> 01:06:47,759
is actually what gives us often the most

01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:51,029
purpose and so try to incorporate that

01:06:47,759 --> 01:06:54,180
in this little definition that I had and

01:06:51,029 --> 01:06:56,549
so I feel like it's usually sort of the

01:06:54,180 --> 01:06:59,549
heart and the uncomfortable work that

01:06:56,549 --> 01:07:02,970
results in life-changing outcomes that

01:06:59,549 --> 01:07:05,700
is particularly meaningful and powerful

01:07:02,970 --> 01:07:07,650
and there's actually other people that

01:07:05,700 --> 01:07:10,410
have studied these kinds of things are

01:07:07,650 --> 01:07:13,350
things along the same way and they say

01:07:10,410 --> 01:07:14,790
that not only does it get purpose what

01:07:13,350 --> 01:07:18,840
they study is actually it's the recipe

01:07:14,790 --> 01:07:22,200
for success and so I let them explain

01:07:18,840 --> 01:07:24,870
that one characteristic emerged as a

01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:27,180
significant predictor of success and it

01:07:24,870 --> 01:07:30,300
wasn't social intelligence it wasn't

01:07:27,180 --> 01:07:35,520
good looks physical health and it wasn't

01:07:30,300 --> 01:07:38,580
IQ it was grit grit is passion and

01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:42,300
perseverance for very long-term goals

01:07:38,580 --> 01:07:46,230
grit is having stamina grit is sticking

01:07:42,300 --> 01:07:49,290
with your future day-in day-out not just

01:07:46,230 --> 01:07:52,830
for the week not just for the month but

01:07:49,290 --> 01:07:57,530
for years and working really hard to

01:07:52,830 --> 01:07:59,880
make that future a reality there's no

01:07:57,530 --> 01:08:03,360
there's no doubt I think that art

01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:05,190
community has a lot of grits you know I

01:08:03,360 --> 01:08:07,290
think the reason Drupal is successful is

01:08:05,190 --> 01:08:10,080
because of that passion a purpose and

01:08:07,290 --> 01:08:12,330
all of the hard work of so many people

01:08:10,080 --> 01:08:15,420
and so I wanted to take a moment to

01:08:12,330 --> 01:08:17,250
really thank the people that arguably of

01:08:15,420 --> 01:08:19,260
the most gripped in our community and

01:08:17,250 --> 01:08:23,210
these are the many maintainer so please

01:08:19,260 --> 01:08:23,210
give it up to all of the maintainer

01:08:29,839 --> 01:08:34,139
and and when I say maintain errs I mean

01:08:32,460 --> 01:08:36,989
that in the broad sense the people that

01:08:34,139 --> 01:08:39,449
work in the discussion forums and

01:08:36,989 --> 01:08:41,849
provide support to those that work the

01:08:39,449 --> 01:08:44,310
issue queues and do patch reviews to the

01:08:41,849 --> 01:08:47,790
security team and and you know the work

01:08:44,310 --> 01:08:49,469
that they do release managers in all of

01:08:47,790 --> 01:08:51,270
these people there's so many of you that

01:08:49,469 --> 01:08:55,080
do really really hard work that is

01:08:51,270 --> 01:08:58,319
tedious and tiresome but it is a key

01:08:55,080 --> 01:09:00,029
element to our success

01:08:58,319 --> 01:09:03,089
there's also another study that I found

01:09:00,029 --> 01:09:04,619
that I wanted to share real quick it's

01:09:03,089 --> 01:09:07,109
actually based on a book and in the book

01:09:04,619 --> 01:09:09,630
they talk about how the love or the

01:09:07,109 --> 01:09:12,839
emotions between two people evolved over

01:09:09,630 --> 01:09:15,779
time and so you can see it in the graph

01:09:12,839 --> 01:09:18,239
but when you start dating typically

01:09:15,779 --> 01:09:20,460
there's a lot of intensity and passion

01:09:18,239 --> 01:09:22,380
early on in the relationship and then

01:09:20,460 --> 01:09:24,540
over time there's something called

01:09:22,380 --> 01:09:26,489
companionship that starts to grow and

01:09:24,540 --> 01:09:28,650
grow and it's actually companionship

01:09:26,489 --> 01:09:31,230
that will sort of sustain the

01:09:28,650 --> 01:09:32,849
relationship for many many years and

01:09:31,230 --> 01:09:34,650
I've seen this myself with my

01:09:32,849 --> 01:09:37,580
grandparents for example who had been

01:09:34,650 --> 01:09:40,099
married for over I think it's 40 years

01:09:37,580 --> 01:09:44,520
which is pretty incredible

01:09:40,099 --> 01:09:46,770
and in a way this Maps directly onto our

01:09:44,520 --> 01:09:50,130
community and sort of ties into a drew

01:09:46,770 --> 01:09:52,349
is talking about that and even my story

01:09:50,130 --> 01:09:54,089
so I feel like in the early days my

01:09:52,349 --> 01:09:55,889
passion was all about the code as I

01:09:54,089 --> 01:09:57,360
mentioned right and then over time I

01:09:55,889 --> 01:09:59,849
became more passionate about the

01:09:57,360 --> 01:10:05,489
community as well as the impact no

01:09:59,849 --> 01:10:07,260
Drupal has on the world and I think as I

01:10:05,489 --> 01:10:09,150
mentioned that is true for many of you

01:10:07,260 --> 01:10:10,830
and it's interesting to keep this graph

01:10:09,150 --> 01:10:12,929
in mind because it actually explains

01:10:10,830 --> 01:10:14,790
some of the decision-making in our

01:10:12,929 --> 01:10:17,340
community you know when you're early on

01:10:14,790 --> 01:10:20,760
on this timeline you're probably going

01:10:17,340 --> 01:10:23,159
to make decisions based on the code and

01:10:20,760 --> 01:10:25,170
maybe the impact on yourself and then

01:10:23,159 --> 01:10:28,080
over time the way you make decisions

01:10:25,170 --> 01:10:30,239
tend to evolve to be more in you know in

01:10:28,080 --> 01:10:33,929
the best interest of the community as

01:10:30,239 --> 01:10:37,310
well as sort of the world at large and

01:10:33,929 --> 01:10:41,340
one example of a person that we spoke to

01:10:37,310 --> 01:10:42,440
is suci and I'll let her speak to that

01:10:41,340 --> 01:10:48,530
as well

01:10:42,440 --> 01:10:50,810
I love to work in Drupal who get deep

01:10:48,530 --> 01:10:53,480
into the code and find out why something

01:10:50,810 --> 01:10:55,790
is not working or why something is

01:10:53,480 --> 01:10:57,500
nothing the way it is working that was

01:10:55,790 --> 01:10:59,510
one of the feedback given to me as well

01:10:57,500 --> 01:11:01,880
if now that you're growing in the

01:10:59,510 --> 01:11:03,500
hierarchy you need to get away of bits

01:11:01,880 --> 01:11:06,409
from the code but that's something I'm

01:11:03,500 --> 01:11:08,960
not able to do I love the community of

01:11:06,409 --> 01:11:11,210
hoop just meeting the people and getting

01:11:08,960 --> 01:11:13,190
the vibe of those people that's just

01:11:11,210 --> 01:11:15,530
something else we have always said that

01:11:13,190 --> 01:11:17,480
for Drupal you come for the code but you

01:11:15,530 --> 01:11:19,820
stay for the community and how will the

01:11:17,480 --> 01:11:21,590
community beats from the Sun until you

01:11:19,820 --> 01:11:23,750
go ahead and try to contribute and

01:11:21,590 --> 01:11:25,790
contribution can be in many ways if

01:11:23,750 --> 01:11:28,100
everybody thought that okay let me just

01:11:25,790 --> 01:11:30,860
use the software and not try and improve

01:11:28,100 --> 01:11:33,110
it how will the software improve even if

01:11:30,860 --> 01:11:35,030
somebody sees a bug and goes ahead and

01:11:33,110 --> 01:11:37,550
reports the bug that is some sort of

01:11:35,030 --> 01:11:39,679
contribution and because it person found

01:11:37,550 --> 01:11:42,770
the bug in the second person fix the bug

01:11:39,679 --> 01:11:44,900
now the whole drupal is much better for

01:11:42,770 --> 01:11:46,699
tens of thousands of people to use I

01:11:44,900 --> 01:11:49,340
would think it's fair that if you are

01:11:46,699 --> 01:11:50,989
using something for free specifically

01:11:49,340 --> 01:11:53,360
and if you are getting something out of

01:11:50,989 --> 01:11:56,239
it why not give something back as well

01:11:53,360 --> 01:11:59,480
that should be the spirit so her story

01:11:56,239 --> 01:12:02,389
really resonates with me and it's you

01:11:59,480 --> 01:12:03,860
know it's why I care so much about you

01:12:02,389 --> 01:12:05,690
know helping individuals and

01:12:03,860 --> 01:12:10,730
organizations you know give back or

01:12:05,690 --> 01:12:14,330
contribute to Drupal so one of the

01:12:10,730 --> 01:12:16,190
underlying messages here in my mind is

01:12:14,330 --> 01:12:17,960
that the bigger an open-source project

01:12:16,190 --> 01:12:20,900
gets the bigger the impact of the

01:12:17,960 --> 01:12:22,790
projects and so how do we scale that

01:12:20,900 --> 01:12:24,889
impact it's something that I care about

01:12:22,790 --> 01:12:26,300
and I think the best way to scale the

01:12:24,889 --> 01:12:28,520
impact is actually to attract more

01:12:26,300 --> 01:12:30,469
people to the project but to attract

01:12:28,520 --> 01:12:33,980
them in a way that sort of instills the

01:12:30,469 --> 01:12:35,929
values and the purpose you know into

01:12:33,980 --> 01:12:39,290
them you know not just attract anyone

01:12:35,929 --> 01:12:41,719
but you know make sure that they share

01:12:39,290 --> 01:12:44,690
those values and there's actually a

01:12:41,719 --> 01:12:48,650
number of groups that are doing exactly

01:12:44,690 --> 01:12:50,900
this and one example is in India the

01:12:48,650 --> 01:12:52,489
campus ambassador programme so when I

01:12:50,900 --> 01:12:54,380
went to India for Drupal con had a

01:12:52,489 --> 01:12:55,690
chance to meet them had not heard about

01:12:54,380 --> 01:12:58,510
this but what

01:12:55,690 --> 01:13:01,150
doing is really remarkable so their goal

01:12:58,510 --> 01:13:03,460
is to get a Drupal ambassador or maybe

01:13:01,150 --> 01:13:06,070
multiple Drupal ambassadors in every

01:13:03,460 --> 01:13:08,010
University in India there's you know

01:13:06,070 --> 01:13:10,960
thousands of universities in India and

01:13:08,010 --> 01:13:14,230
that ambassador becomes a spokesperson

01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:17,230
for Drupal that will organize meetups

01:13:14,230 --> 01:13:20,250
training all of these things and

01:13:17,230 --> 01:13:22,600
eventually helps people get a Drupal job

01:13:20,250 --> 01:13:25,080
right I was like wow that's pretty

01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:28,000
pretty amazing and very ambitious and

01:13:25,080 --> 01:13:29,380
the people behind this project or you

01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:32,020
know incredible

01:13:29,380 --> 01:13:33,610
one example is Rakesh you know it's part

01:13:32,020 --> 01:13:36,990
of his program and Rakesh himself

01:13:33,610 --> 01:13:47,110
astraying over 600 drupal lists in india

01:13:36,990 --> 01:13:49,840
that's pretty special and I'm closer to

01:13:47,110 --> 01:13:52,030
home if you will there is the UK drupal

01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:55,450
apprenticeship program which I also

01:13:52,030 --> 01:13:56,740
hadn't heard about yet but they did a

01:13:55,450 --> 01:13:58,690
couple of things one of the things that

01:13:56,740 --> 01:14:00,460
they do is they provide you know boot

01:13:58,690 --> 01:14:02,440
camps for people who want to learn

01:14:00,460 --> 01:14:04,330
Drupal and you know very quickly get

01:14:02,440 --> 01:14:07,180
into the workforce

01:14:04,330 --> 01:14:10,360
part of that is also in depth an

01:14:07,180 --> 01:14:12,130
in-depth training program for you know

01:14:10,360 --> 01:14:14,440
let's say disadvantaged young people

01:14:12,130 --> 01:14:17,170
like people that have great talents and

01:14:14,440 --> 01:14:19,510
maybe a great aptitude but they may not

01:14:17,170 --> 01:14:21,910
have access to sort of a normal career

01:14:19,510 --> 01:14:24,510
path let's say and so what they do is

01:14:21,910 --> 01:14:27,640
they train them and then they place them

01:14:24,510 --> 01:14:30,970
in in Drupal companies or you know

01:14:27,640 --> 01:14:33,490
customers and all of that is paid for so

01:14:30,970 --> 01:14:35,890
the training is free and then it's also

01:14:33,490 --> 01:14:38,410
free for the employer because this

01:14:35,890 --> 01:14:41,140
program is a government funded for these

01:14:38,410 --> 01:14:44,860
kinds of people and so I talked to one

01:14:41,140 --> 01:14:47,350
of the graduates which is Jackie I don't

01:14:44,860 --> 01:14:50,170
know if Jackie's here maybe it is maybe

01:14:47,350 --> 01:14:52,180
it's not I know it Jack you know came

01:14:50,170 --> 01:14:54,640
out of this program of a little video of

01:14:52,180 --> 01:14:57,160
Jack as well as some of the people

01:14:54,640 --> 01:15:01,780
behind the program so I'll show you that

01:14:57,160 --> 01:15:05,100
as well my career has changed massively

01:15:01,780 --> 01:15:07,600
I've got an employer after the two weeks

01:15:05,100 --> 01:15:09,249
once you're in this kind of industry is

01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:11,199
hard to fall out of work

01:15:09,249 --> 01:15:13,059
for example LinkedIn officers come up

01:15:11,199 --> 01:15:14,650
every day that would be my oven to be

01:15:13,059 --> 01:15:16,690
able to see that there is so much demand

01:15:14,650 --> 01:15:19,630
for Drupal out there at the moment I'm

01:15:16,690 --> 01:15:21,579
planning my whole future based on Drupal

01:15:19,630 --> 01:15:23,409
I'm starting to plan looking at buying

01:15:21,579 --> 01:15:25,329
houses and staff there the exciting

01:15:23,409 --> 01:15:26,289
thing for me is that I know that is

01:15:25,329 --> 01:15:28,420
totally achievable

01:15:26,289 --> 01:15:31,960
by the time linemen say I said you know

01:15:28,420 --> 01:15:34,630
I'm only 20 now so I tell anyone that

01:15:31,960 --> 01:15:36,789
even considers the people industry

01:15:34,630 --> 01:15:39,099
there's so many opportunities for

01:15:36,789 --> 01:15:42,130
example myself I've come a very long way

01:15:39,099 --> 01:15:44,229
from a job out of college what happen

01:15:42,130 --> 01:15:46,929
very much to go on not really being sure

01:15:44,229 --> 01:15:49,960
what directed to go to be somewhere like

01:15:46,929 --> 01:15:51,670
this now I feel extremely privileged we

01:15:49,960 --> 01:15:54,280
are changing up so the better we are

01:15:51,670 --> 01:15:58,530
seeing young people be able to improve

01:15:54,280 --> 01:16:01,809
their lives and improve confidence and

01:15:58,530 --> 01:16:04,210
improve their sense of themselves and

01:16:01,809 --> 01:16:06,849
their own well-being that's a massive

01:16:04,210 --> 01:16:08,860
difference a massive impact and that is

01:16:06,849 --> 01:16:11,849
one of the things that really drives me

01:16:08,860 --> 01:16:16,469
and motivates me to to make this project

01:16:11,849 --> 01:16:16,469
success because we need to do this fine

01:16:17,400 --> 01:16:25,300
I was down in London to make him a year

01:16:22,690 --> 01:16:28,289
or so on from from leaving the scheme

01:16:25,300 --> 01:16:28,289
and doing really really well

01:16:32,070 --> 01:16:38,229
necessarily excluded from starting and

01:16:35,219 --> 01:16:40,570
I'm very pleased to be part of a

01:16:38,229 --> 01:16:42,309
solution and filling that the skills gap

01:16:40,570 --> 01:16:45,849
encouraging more and more young people

01:16:42,309 --> 01:16:50,489
to take this up with I think a good

01:16:45,849 --> 01:16:50,489
thing to be doing yeah

01:16:54,530 --> 01:16:59,130
so so Jackie is currently working as a

01:16:57,570 --> 01:17:03,750
Drupal developer in London

01:16:59,130 --> 01:17:06,150
yeah and so question is how do we take

01:17:03,750 --> 01:17:09,150
these things global right like it's

01:17:06,150 --> 01:17:11,070
great all these programs in India and in

01:17:09,150 --> 01:17:12,900
London and even Frank mentioned what

01:17:11,070 --> 01:17:15,690
he's doing in Africa like how do we like

01:17:12,900 --> 01:17:17,760
how do we take this global because these

01:17:15,690 --> 01:17:19,350
are the these are all great programs and

01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:22,230
I think these are the programs that also

01:17:19,350 --> 01:17:26,520
instill the values in the culture and

01:17:22,230 --> 01:17:30,540
the purpose into into these people

01:17:26,520 --> 01:17:33,510
and so yeah love to see more ideas if

01:17:30,540 --> 01:17:36,389
you have any and so just to wrap it up

01:17:33,510 --> 01:17:38,820
so after after talking to all of these

01:17:36,389 --> 01:17:41,400
people and based on my own sort of

01:17:38,820 --> 01:17:45,330
retrospective or reflections and in

01:17:41,400 --> 01:17:49,469
Italy I've really come to the conclusion

01:17:45,330 --> 01:17:51,270
that Drupal is fuelled by service notion

01:17:49,469 --> 01:17:53,730
of a collective collective sense of

01:17:51,270 --> 01:17:56,580
purpose right you know dripless powerful

01:17:53,730 --> 01:17:58,650
software Drupal is like strong great

01:17:56,580 --> 01:18:01,350
community of people but I think the

01:17:58,650 --> 01:18:06,330
third leg to the stool is the sense of

01:18:01,350 --> 01:18:07,770
purpose and you know as I mentioned in

01:18:06,330 --> 01:18:10,460
the beginning of my presentation I think

01:18:07,770 --> 01:18:13,350
we need to continue to talk about that

01:18:10,460 --> 01:18:15,360
but I wanted to do today is just kind of

01:18:13,350 --> 01:18:17,880
start the conversation like I don't have

01:18:15,360 --> 01:18:19,710
all the answers but I think we have to

01:18:17,880 --> 01:18:22,710
start talking about it more so we can

01:18:19,710 --> 01:18:24,480
you know articulate our purpose as well

01:18:22,710 --> 01:18:28,580
as the you know keep it in mind when we

01:18:24,480 --> 01:18:28,580
make decisions and things like that

01:18:34,440 --> 01:18:38,429
there is no alternative I would like to

01:18:36,690 --> 01:18:40,679
see more competition there is no

01:18:38,429 --> 01:18:42,480
alternative every time people come to me

01:18:40,679 --> 01:18:44,429
and say you know Drupal 8 is slow I was

01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:47,010
like when last time your interpolate

01:18:44,429 --> 01:18:50,460
website it works and it works very well

01:18:47,010 --> 01:18:52,050
best thing is for me is and the worst

01:18:50,460 --> 01:18:54,270
thing is well there is no alternative

01:18:52,050 --> 01:18:56,670
I would like to see more competition but

01:18:54,270 --> 01:18:59,040
it seems no no one even goes there to

01:18:56,670 --> 01:19:00,870
compete especially you know in the

01:18:59,040 --> 01:19:03,780
freedom a to actually make something

01:19:00,870 --> 01:19:06,420
that is so for me just simple as there's

01:19:03,780 --> 01:19:08,550
no other tool that can do that it's a

01:19:06,420 --> 01:19:09,929
fail and always complete peace that

01:19:08,550 --> 01:19:11,400
actually works it's the feeling of

01:19:09,929 --> 01:19:13,980
actually putting the bridge across the

01:19:11,400 --> 01:19:15,840
relative people go through and back it's

01:19:13,980 --> 01:19:18,449
it's it's a it's a feeling of

01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:20,250
achievement human beings always were you

01:19:18,449 --> 01:19:23,929
know feeling of achievement something

01:19:20,250 --> 01:19:27,330
the illustration I run the marathon I

01:19:23,929 --> 01:19:30,480
want to a difference I built a bridge I

01:19:27,330 --> 01:19:33,000
release Drupal 8 I think they all kinda

01:19:30,480 --> 01:19:38,310
sit on the same well it's an achievement

01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:40,460
and the people all right thank you very

01:19:38,310 --> 01:19:40,460
much

01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:56,360
I think we have time for a few questions

01:19:50,970 --> 01:19:56,360
I mature I'll leave it up - all right

01:20:01,010 --> 01:20:23,910
hi mark maybe one there there you go

01:20:21,270 --> 01:20:28,020
thank you and beautiful a good body

01:20:23,910 --> 01:20:30,450
rakia means hello and welcome to Dublin

01:20:28,020 --> 01:20:35,430
okay we've got a actually got a lot of

01:20:30,450 --> 01:20:37,700
questions um Richard Lugar wants to know

01:20:35,430 --> 01:20:39,960
what's the latest on decoupled or

01:20:37,700 --> 01:20:42,330
progressively decoupled Drupal and

01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:45,180
front-end frameworks do you have a

01:20:42,330 --> 01:20:47,310
personal favorite and I guess what's the

01:20:45,180 --> 01:20:48,750
kind of general status of JavaScript

01:20:47,310 --> 01:20:49,130
libraries coming to core of things like

01:20:48,750 --> 01:20:56,340
that

01:20:49,130 --> 01:21:01,140
great question anyway to kick it off so

01:20:56,340 --> 01:21:04,110
let me see so you know I think I mean

01:21:01,140 --> 01:21:06,870
first of all I think it's a you know the

01:21:04,110 --> 01:21:10,320
question I think whether to standardize

01:21:06,870 --> 01:21:12,890
on a JavaScript framework is a very big

01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:14,910
question it's a very complex question I

01:21:12,890 --> 01:21:18,000
definitely want to acknowledge that I

01:21:14,910 --> 01:21:20,490
think it affects so many dimensions from

01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:23,070
the developer experience some people

01:21:20,490 --> 01:21:25,380
will say oh it's much easier and I think

01:21:23,070 --> 01:21:27,420
we've seen some of that working on on

01:21:25,380 --> 01:21:29,940
some of the outside in things where it's

01:21:27,420 --> 01:21:33,030
you know extra work to use jQuery and

01:21:29,940 --> 01:21:36,270
backbone and the likes so some people

01:21:33,030 --> 01:21:38,940
say this would be so much better

01:21:36,270 --> 01:21:40,620
other people obviously are maybe afraid

01:21:38,940 --> 01:21:43,050
that they have to learn all these new

01:21:40,620 --> 01:21:47,310
tools in a chicken a time or there's a

01:21:43,050 --> 01:21:49,350
lot of change and there's also on the

01:21:47,310 --> 01:21:51,990
operational site you know if you run a

01:21:49,350 --> 01:21:55,020
Drupal site but now you have to run you

01:21:51,990 --> 01:21:57,720
know a JavaScript framework alongside of

01:21:55,020 --> 01:21:59,760
that that also changes how you host and

01:21:57,720 --> 01:22:01,680
run websites which is also

01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:05,550
introduces complexities and trade-offs

01:22:01,680 --> 01:22:10,290
there so the whole question is very

01:22:05,550 --> 01:22:13,350
complex I think that personally my

01:22:10,290 --> 01:22:15,510
opinion and another not a femur or a

01:22:13,350 --> 01:22:18,330
front-end developer is that we would be

01:22:15,510 --> 01:22:20,970
better served with having a JavaScript

01:22:18,330 --> 01:22:25,050
framework that we can standardize on the

01:22:20,970 --> 01:22:27,390
question is when and what framework I

01:22:25,050 --> 01:22:31,680
think for me the question isn't

01:22:27,390 --> 01:22:35,790
necessarily if again that's my personal

01:22:31,680 --> 01:22:38,340
opinion I don't think we need to answer

01:22:35,790 --> 01:22:39,810
the question right away I think we have

01:22:38,340 --> 01:22:42,840
a little bit of time to answer the

01:22:39,810 --> 01:22:44,970
question you know what framework and one

01:22:42,840 --> 01:22:48,530
and so that's why the current strategy

01:22:44,970 --> 01:22:52,410
is to explore progressive decoupled

01:22:48,530 --> 01:22:54,600
applications which allows us to get a

01:22:52,410 --> 01:22:56,940
feel of what it would be like and it's

01:22:54,600 --> 01:22:59,580
also why the strategy is to really

01:22:56,940 --> 01:23:01,680
invest in API first Drupal which I've

01:22:59,580 --> 01:23:05,010
shown in the keynote because that allows

01:23:01,680 --> 01:23:07,710
people in organizations to build

01:23:05,010 --> 01:23:10,200
JavaScript applications very easily or

01:23:07,710 --> 01:23:12,210
much more easily with Drupal in the in

01:23:10,200 --> 01:23:15,030
the backend and I think that will we'll

01:23:12,210 --> 01:23:17,670
learn a lot from that you know so I

01:23:15,030 --> 01:23:19,080
think that's kind of the state of that

01:23:17,670 --> 01:23:21,560
okay thank you

01:23:19,080 --> 01:23:25,170
there's one question with which I dodged

01:23:21,560 --> 01:23:28,440
which is which is my favorite which I'm

01:23:25,170 --> 01:23:30,060
really not the best person to to answer

01:23:28,440 --> 01:23:32,910
that to be honest and I think we should

01:23:30,060 --> 01:23:34,380
probably make that decision I don't know

01:23:32,910 --> 01:23:36,840
what the best way to make that decision

01:23:34,380 --> 01:23:40,020
is maybe a small community of actually

01:23:36,840 --> 01:23:41,640
front end people that go often and we

01:23:40,020 --> 01:23:43,830
let you dodged that bullet so a decision

01:23:41,640 --> 01:23:46,530
but right now I'm really intrigued in

01:23:43,830 --> 01:23:50,220
ember and the reason I'm so intrigued by

01:23:46,530 --> 01:23:52,560
ember you know it's not for technical

01:23:50,220 --> 01:23:54,930
reasons but for community reasons the

01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:56,670
Ember community looks a lot like Drupal

01:23:54,930 --> 01:23:58,680
community and its really engaged with us

01:23:56,670 --> 01:24:02,220
in a way that the other communities

01:23:58,680 --> 01:24:06,710
haven't so that's one dimension to

01:24:02,220 --> 01:24:08,810
consider okay next question

01:24:06,710 --> 01:24:11,180
Calend wants to know what are your

01:24:08,810 --> 01:24:14,270
thoughts on how Drupal 9 will develop at

01:24:11,180 --> 01:24:19,070
this point or isn't just about moving

01:24:14,270 --> 01:24:21,440
backwards compatibility yeah so it's a

01:24:19,070 --> 01:24:26,260
great question we don't have the answers

01:24:21,440 --> 01:24:29,240
yet but obviously Drupal 9 could be

01:24:26,260 --> 01:24:32,510
interesting because you know a Drupal 8

01:24:29,240 --> 01:24:34,390
having these major releases 8.1 8.2 and

01:24:32,510 --> 01:24:40,220
they're being backwards compatibility

01:24:34,390 --> 01:24:41,720
between major drupal releases their

01:24:40,220 --> 01:24:44,840
hopes is that what that will mean is

01:24:41,720 --> 01:24:48,770
that it's the upgrade to Drupal mine

01:24:44,840 --> 01:24:51,200
could be substantially less disruptive

01:24:48,770 --> 01:24:53,060
you know pretty sure there's gonna be

01:24:51,200 --> 01:24:55,430
API changes in an upgrade path from

01:24:53,060 --> 01:24:58,310
eight point x whatever the latest X will

01:24:55,430 --> 01:25:02,240
be tonight but it could be a lot easier

01:24:58,310 --> 01:25:03,980
because we have this you know approach

01:25:02,240 --> 01:25:05,720
now where we can add these features and

01:25:03,980 --> 01:25:08,690
we can introduce in an API so they can

01:25:05,720 --> 01:25:11,510
introduce them sooner module maintainer

01:25:08,690 --> 01:25:14,360
scan adopt them sooner and so a lot of a

01:25:11,510 --> 01:25:18,770
Drupal 9 freebies dropping those

01:25:14,360 --> 01:25:20,210
backwards compatibility layers at the

01:25:18,770 --> 01:25:22,010
same time I just want to reiterate that

01:25:20,210 --> 01:25:24,470
that is a little bit too early to tell

01:25:22,010 --> 01:25:28,330
if that's actually practical and how

01:25:24,470 --> 01:25:33,100
easy or hard it would be but I guess I'm

01:25:28,330 --> 01:25:35,960
cautiously optimistic that the triple 9

01:25:33,100 --> 01:25:42,710
development cycle will be you know more

01:25:35,960 --> 01:25:46,460
it's a word smooth likely related to

01:25:42,710 --> 01:25:48,650
that Bert Borland is wondering scheduled

01:25:46,460 --> 01:25:49,970
releases semantic versioning is there a

01:25:48,650 --> 01:25:52,820
possibility that we would have an

01:25:49,970 --> 01:25:54,800
evergreen Drupal sorry is there a

01:25:52,820 --> 01:25:57,080
possibility of an evergreen Drupal that

01:25:54,800 --> 01:26:01,010
automatically update an old was Dave Oh

01:25:57,080 --> 01:26:04,940
Ethel a dispersed like auto-updates but

01:26:01,010 --> 01:26:13,820
I guess I don't know it's a good

01:26:04,940 --> 01:26:17,210
question okay would be great Luca an

01:26:13,820 --> 01:26:19,420
aerial one snow both fire with visioning

01:26:17,210 --> 01:26:26,310
in Drupal 8 history possible for fire

01:26:19,420 --> 01:26:26,310
as well as I don't know either I mean

01:26:26,670 --> 01:26:39,790
yeah I don't know I would have to check

01:26:28,690 --> 01:26:43,270
I mean have you heard of Drupal morning

01:26:39,790 --> 01:26:45,730
Damien McKenna is is wondering about is

01:26:43,270 --> 01:26:48,520
a time that the Drupal community does a

01:26:45,730 --> 01:26:51,100
push for a contribution effort like fine

01:26:48,520 --> 01:26:52,449
for the future to get more companies to

01:26:51,100 --> 01:26:54,550
contribute and can you talk a little

01:26:52,449 --> 01:26:56,890
about contributing to Drupal in terms of

01:26:54,550 --> 01:27:02,199
as individuals and as organizations and

01:26:56,890 --> 01:27:04,600
types of contribution yeah so you know I

01:27:02,199 --> 01:27:07,330
did this blog post a few weeks ago by

01:27:04,600 --> 01:27:10,630
sort of who contributes to Drupal or who

01:27:07,330 --> 01:27:12,820
sponsors Drupal and you know what the

01:27:10,630 --> 01:27:14,830
results have shown is that we went from

01:27:12,820 --> 01:27:16,630
you know when I started Drupal was all

01:27:14,830 --> 01:27:20,520
volunteer based and then more and more

01:27:16,630 --> 01:27:24,100
people got involved too today we're

01:27:20,520 --> 01:27:26,670
actually you know the majority of the

01:27:24,100 --> 01:27:29,050
work is sponsored work today which is

01:27:26,670 --> 01:27:33,640
which is kind of a change to the early

01:27:29,050 --> 01:27:36,160
days and it also showed that most of the

01:27:33,640 --> 01:27:38,290
sponsors are what I described as the

01:27:36,160 --> 01:27:41,590
traditional Drupal businesses so these

01:27:38,290 --> 01:27:44,530
are smaller Drupal shops that are known

01:27:41,590 --> 01:27:47,650
to be Drupal experts versus maybe larger

01:27:44,530 --> 01:27:50,949
digital agencies that are where people

01:27:47,650 --> 01:27:52,360
go to because not necessarily because

01:27:50,949 --> 01:27:54,219
they weren't Drupal they go there

01:27:52,360 --> 01:27:57,010
because of a problem doing a solution

01:27:54,219 --> 01:28:00,370
and these little agencies typically

01:27:57,010 --> 01:28:03,610
specialize in Drupal and Adobe incite or

01:28:00,370 --> 01:28:07,000
in you know numerous platforms they're

01:28:03,610 --> 01:28:08,560
also tend to be bigger and so what we've

01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:11,770
seen is that most of the contributions

01:28:08,560 --> 01:28:14,440
come from the triple shops you know not

01:28:11,770 --> 01:28:17,380
surprisingly so I think what we need to

01:28:14,440 --> 01:28:19,570
do is we need to make sure that these

01:28:17,380 --> 01:28:21,370
companies are successful you know

01:28:19,570 --> 01:28:23,110
they're they're doing incredible things

01:28:21,370 --> 01:28:24,699
contributing spending a lot of time and

01:28:23,110 --> 01:28:27,610
money to contribute and we need to

01:28:24,699 --> 01:28:29,560
promote those contributions at the same

01:28:27,610 --> 01:28:32,649
time we also need to figure out ways to

01:28:29,560 --> 01:28:35,229
get those that are not contributing

01:28:32,649 --> 01:28:38,019
like many of the large digital agencies

01:28:35,229 --> 01:28:40,569
or the system integrators or a lot of

01:28:38,019 --> 01:28:42,969
the Drupal shops quite frankly as well

01:28:40,569 --> 01:28:45,879
as customers and end users we need to

01:28:42,969 --> 01:28:51,969
find ways that encourage of encourages

01:28:45,879 --> 01:28:55,449
them to contribute right and as much as

01:28:51,969 --> 01:28:56,979
a love for them to contribute just

01:28:55,449 --> 01:28:59,469
because they can I think most

01:28:56,979 --> 01:29:04,059
organizations are frankly coin-operated

01:28:59,469 --> 01:29:06,249
and they need they need a good business

01:29:04,059 --> 01:29:09,219
reason to contribute so I think that's

01:29:06,249 --> 01:29:11,139
why I've been pushing for giving them

01:29:09,219 --> 01:29:13,359
more visibility because it gives them

01:29:11,139 --> 01:29:16,089
more business and help you know allows

01:29:13,359 --> 01:29:18,760
them to position themselves as a great

01:29:16,089 --> 01:29:20,769
company to work for and so they they get

01:29:18,760 --> 01:29:24,629
access to hopefully the best Drupal

01:29:20,769 --> 01:29:26,919
talent so it's a very complex question

01:29:24,629 --> 01:29:29,289
you know that we have to spend some time

01:29:26,919 --> 01:29:31,199
on as a community Thank You trees and

01:29:29,289 --> 01:29:35,530
the last one it's not a question or a

01:29:31,199 --> 01:29:39,669
typical Morton order he is going to help

01:29:35,530 --> 01:29:40,989
you with that team there you go thank

01:29:39,669 --> 01:29:42,999
you very much with us Thank You Martin

01:29:40,989 --> 01:29:45,749
guys we have to stay here I think for

01:29:42,999 --> 01:29:45,749
