you have with your sponsorship DrupalCon

00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:27,289
is a monster of its own and our

00:00:23,929 --> 00:00:30,619
sponsorship packages tend to be unique

00:00:27,289 --> 00:00:33,170
in its own as well so this webcast is

00:00:30,619 --> 00:00:36,620
here to help you guys out answer any

00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:38,289
questions that you guys have in regards

00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:42,739
to your sponsorship package and

00:00:38,289 --> 00:00:46,460
basically any general overview to make

00:00:42,739 --> 00:00:48,199

00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:51,440
foremost I want to welcome you guys all

00:00:48,199 --> 00:00:54,620
and thank you without your guys's

00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:56,390
sponsorship support DrupalCon would not

00:00:54,620 --> 00:01:01,550
happen and I can't stress that enough

00:00:56,390 --> 00:01:04,420
because it's true and it is our role and

00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:07,100
it is my role to make sure that your

00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:10,939
sponsorship is appreciated and you guys

00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:13,850
have as easy as time and as fun as time

00:01:10,939 --> 00:01:17,150
as possible so that's where this comes

00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:19,970
in if you have any questions during this

00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:23,360
webinar feel free to drop them in the

00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:26,780
Q&A window and bring in on the other end

00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:30,200
of this will answer them and pause me

00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:33,619
when he has time and we'll answer those

00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:35,450
live right here for you alright so just

00:01:33,619 --> 00:01:38,060
to get started right away here's an

00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:41,180
agenda of today we're gonna cover our

00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:43,700
all the benefits that come with the

00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:45,890
sponsorship packages keep in mind that

00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:49,670
all the benefits don't apply to your

00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:53,030
specific sponsorship but I will go over

00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:55,840
all of them just because basically each

00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:59,270
launch to packages is a combination of

00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:01,700
these base benefits so I'm gonna cover

00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:04,250
how to fulfill them what you need to do

00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:06,530
on your end when things are due and any

00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:09,590
specs and whatnot

00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:12,030
then I'm going to go over exhibiting so

00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:16,330
this is going to cover the

00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:18,550
schedule of the conference as far as the

00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:21,850
exhibiting goes a load and set up when

00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:24,130
you need to be ready then we're gonna

00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:26,920
get into ordering services and materials

00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:30,190
for your sponsorship or for your

00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:32,980
exhibiting booth we work with a number

00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:35,950
of vendors each kind of service their

00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:39,010
own need so I'm gonna cover there and

00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:41,050
how to go about doing that and then

00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:43,290
we're gonna go over shipping shipping

00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:46,830
tends to be a little bit complicated

00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:48,640
especially when we are working

00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:52,890
internationally like we are now and

00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:56,230
Dublin in particular has strange customs

00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:59,320
to follow and then we're going to go

00:02:56,230 --> 00:03:03,910
over a basic travel and hotel to the

00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:06,190
venue and to Dublin and many of you

00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:08,500
probably already know are familiar with

00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:10,030
it but again DrupalCon is pretty unique

00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:12,370
so I'm just going to go over the general

00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:17,430
program of DrupalCon

00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:21,700
and what each programming aspect is for

00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:23,980
the conference's events so as I

00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:28,420
mentioned before we're going to start

00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:32,019
with your benefits so all of you should

00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:34,420
have received an email from me that will

00:03:32,019 --> 00:03:36,610
basically say welcome to Jupiter on

00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:39,010
Dublin 2016

00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:42,459
important information about your

00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:45,130
sponsorship in that initial email there

00:03:42,459 --> 00:03:47,200
was a few due dates but more importantly

00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:49,989
there was a link to this DrupalCon

00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:52,090
Dublin sponsor a VIN kit inside this

00:03:49,989 --> 00:03:54,400
vent kit you can literally find base

00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:56,799
everything that you need in regards to

00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,840
your sponsorship so you can find due

00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:03,610
dates you can find contact the

00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:08,019
information you can find schedules links

00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:10,239
to specific submission pages whatever it

00:04:08,019 --> 00:04:12,549
may be it's all going to live here but

00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:16,769
do keep in mind that this is basically a

00:04:12,549 --> 00:04:20,109
document consolidating information from

00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:22,960
outside resources so if you want to look

00:04:20,109 --> 00:04:24,789
at something specifically say shipping

00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,250
and handling and be sure to look at

00:04:24,789 --> 00:04:29,600
inter

00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:32,270
close personal document and get in

00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:34,250
contact with them but if you want to

00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:36,140
quick if you have a quick question

00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:39,650
a needs to be answered you probably find

00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:42,230
the answer here and then I also want to

00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:46,850
point out that this is a very long and

00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:47,960
complicated document so just be sure

00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:51,080
when you're reading this you're only

00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:54,860
reading what pertains to your specific

00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:58,160
sponsorship package so I've pointed I

00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:59,660
created this sort of checklist of five

00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,580
things the first things that you should

00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:04,790
do and so the first thing I always like

00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:06,500
to do is go to the table of contents and

00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:09,350
when you go down to the table of

00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:12,110
contents here you can just simply find

00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:15,740
your sponsorship package so if your core

00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:18,830
sponsor you'll go to core if you are a

00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:21,290
module sponsor say you are a lunch

00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:23,810
sponsor you go to your lunch and you can

00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:28,180
find what specifically needs to be done

00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:35,450
in regards to that specific sponsorship

00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:37,130
okay so her this front page I just want

00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:39,650
to let you know that if you guys are a

00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:42,410
core sponsor and you haven't chose your

00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:45,380
bonus yet most of you have please let me

00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:48,860
know and then just begin to run down

00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:53,510
each benefit that pertains to your see

00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:57,800
any important deadlines how to deliver

00:05:53,510 --> 00:06:00,260
upon them and basically how to fulfill

00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:03,350
them on your end and then I point out

00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:05,180
four or five more important and pressing

00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:08,390
matters that you can look at here and

00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:12,410
then information about our exhibitors

00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:15,530
service partners so Hume and CCD cover

00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:18,410
all that later so let's jump right into

00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:23,360
the benefits again all these won't apply

00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:25,190
to everyone but since you know I can't

00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,240
narrow it down who I'm talking to I'm

00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:29,930
just going to go ahead and cover them

00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:32,120
first one is your DrupalCon tickets i've

00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:35,419
sent most of you your tickets and

00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:39,180
basically what i sent was a set amount

00:06:35,419 --> 00:06:41,310
of these unique codes or six digit codes

00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:43,200
so if you're a diamond you got 20 your

00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:48,660
silver you got three if you're a lunch

00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:52,350
you got two and what you need to do with

00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:57,360
these codes is go and redeem them so you

00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:59,610
can redeem them by sending them to the

00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:02,040
person in which is going to claim the

00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:04,620
ticket you can redeem the ticket for

00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:07,500
someone else or you can redeem the

00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:09,360
ticket for you and so how that works is

00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:16,140
when you go to the DrupalCon website

00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:22,740
you'll want to go to register now and as

00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:25,800
soon as this loads you will see a redeem

00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:27,360
a ticket page so again these codes that

00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:29,880
I'm sending you our blank and empty

00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:33,240
tickets they aren't coupon codes as they

00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:35,910
were in the past these are empty tickets

00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:39,210
ready to be redeemed simply take the

00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:41,490
ticket code enter in your reservation

00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:44,430
code here notice that your drupal.org

00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:46,530
account will be filled in automatically

00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:48,420
here and then continue through

00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:50,250
registration no need to go through a

00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:52,710
checkout no need to go through an

00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:55,170
ordering process a number one thing to

00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:56,910
keep in mind is that whoever is claiming

00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:59,670
this ticket needs to have a drupal.org

00:07:56,910 --> 00:08:01,800
account or be using an email address

00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:03,870
that is associated with our drupal.org

00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:06,030
account so if you don't have a trip or

00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:07,970
dog or account or if you're trying to

00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:10,650
redeem the ticket for someone who

00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:13,110
doesn't have one make sure they go ahead

00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:17,370
and get one done and then use that

00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:19,350
information then to jump back up to the

00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:22,830
top here the next thing I want to talk

00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:25,950
about is just your exhibiting booth so

00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:30,090
if your correspond sir meaning you are a

00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:37,050
diamond platinum gold or silver you get

00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:39,090
a booth or a exhibiting space so just as

00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:41,160
a quick overview if you're a diamond or

00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:44,580
platinum you get a six meter by 2 meter

00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:48,440
booth Gold's get 3 meters by 2 meters

00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:50,839
and Silver's get a 2 meter table

00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:54,560
so to get a better idea of what this

00:08:50,839 --> 00:08:56,660
looks like is in Europe we are DrupalCon

00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:59,029
Europe we go with a shell scheme booth

00:08:56,660 --> 00:09:02,569
so right here this is what you're seeing

00:08:59,029 --> 00:09:04,879
is 2/3 live 2 meter booths put together

00:09:02,569 --> 00:09:07,579
so if you're a diamond or platinum and

00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:10,009
you have a six meter by 2 meter you will

00:09:07,579 --> 00:09:11,329
remove this wall and you'll have the

00:09:10,009 --> 00:09:14,389
full space to work with

00:09:11,329 --> 00:09:17,269
if you're an in cap or you're on the

00:09:14,389 --> 00:09:19,069
side you'll notice that you'll be open

00:09:17,269 --> 00:09:21,199
on two sides but if you're enclosed

00:09:19,069 --> 00:09:23,540
meaning you have a sponsor on either

00:09:21,199 --> 00:09:28,370
interview you will be closed on each

00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:31,610
side silver sponsors this is the exact

00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:33,920
setup that you will be provided two

00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:36,410
chairs table tablecloth and in each

00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:38,269
booth

00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:42,500
whether you're gold or platinum you will

00:09:38,269 --> 00:09:44,899
also be provided this same setup so what

00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:49,189
comes with your booth you get shared

00:09:44,899 --> 00:09:51,949
Wi-Fi but as we all know Wi-Fi is not

00:09:49,189 --> 00:09:54,889
guaranteed but you do have the option to

00:09:51,949 --> 00:09:59,000
order hardwire jobs if you are concerned

00:09:54,889 --> 00:10:01,459
about this you get one or two tables

00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:04,220
depending on if you're a six meter by 2

00:10:01,459 --> 00:10:08,000
meter or three meter by 2 meters plus

00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:11,990
two chairs per table what's great about

00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:14,500
this year's or this DrupalCon europe is

00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:18,889
that it does come carpeted so no need to

00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:22,519
order any carpets though if you want to

00:10:18,889 --> 00:10:25,130
stand out a bit and have your booth

00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:27,040
space be separated from the general grey

00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:30,100
carpeting you are welcome to order

00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:34,970
custom carpet or just have custom colors

00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:37,189
there will be electricity provided

00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:39,620
you'll have one double socket which

00:10:37,189 --> 00:10:40,850
provides thousand watts again this is

00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:43,939
different than that's happened in the

00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:48,069
past so I think you guys will be happy

00:10:43,939 --> 00:10:51,439
to learn there'll be two spotlights

00:10:48,069 --> 00:10:53,779
inside your booth and you can have them

00:10:51,439 --> 00:10:58,420
point whichever which way that you want

00:10:53,779 --> 00:11:01,250
one waste basket for trash orage

00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:02,930
if you notice here you'll see a fallacy

00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:05,940
aboard

00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:09,480
you can customize this you can have it

00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:12,990
be a printed design in which you'll work

00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:16,290
with you our vendor partner but if you

00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:21,420
don't make this known it will come just

00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:24,380
saying your company name so if you want

00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:29,190
that customized again that is an option

00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:30,750
and then if you are a silver table or if

00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:33,600
you're a silver sponsor and you just

00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:37,140
have the table you are welcome to bring

00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:39,510
in a free-standing banner as long as

00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:42,870
this no longer than two meters wide or a

00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:45,930
quarter meter in depth essentially the

00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:49,290
length of your table without protruding

00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:51,390
too far behind you obviously if you have

00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:54,570
a booth you're welcome to fix anything

00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:56,940
to the walls customize it as much as you

00:11:54,570 --> 00:12:00,510
would like as long as it fits within the

00:11:56,940 --> 00:12:03,150
booth but when you are a silver sponsor

00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:06,480
you were really confined to your booth

00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:08,460
space or to your table aside from the

00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:12,450
freestanding banner you're welcome to

00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:16,260
order monitors and use this as you will

00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:18,690
and you can place the banner behind you

00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:22,220
or to the right of you but keep in mind

00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:22,220
that space is limited

00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:30,670
so again coming back up top here just

00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:34,149
walking down a list of benefits

00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:36,640
in this is a complicated event kit which

00:12:34,149 --> 00:12:38,140
I'm working on making simpler the next

00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:40,180
thing is just logo placement on the

00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:42,250
website nothing you really need to do

00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:45,880
here but it is important that you send

00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:48,870
me your most up-to-date or correct logo

00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:52,200
some people or some companies want us to

00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:56,019
promote a specific product sometimes

00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:58,540
logo or branding change midway but you

00:12:56,019 --> 00:13:02,290
can also provide the correct URLs so go

00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:04,630
ahead and send me the right logo and the

00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:07,959
URL you would like me to link it to and

00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:09,880
I'll go ahead and upload it for you the

00:13:07,959 --> 00:13:15,279
next thing I want to point out is the

00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:18,730
two ads so if you're a diamond platinum

00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:22,350
or gold you get a print ad in our

00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:26,010
program guidin if you follow this

00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:29,200
bookmark you'll see the specs for that

00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:31,810
and it's important that I want to know

00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:35,500
that this is actually due July 20th this

00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:38,410
sum this takes a little bit more

00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:40,870
internal work on your end so if you

00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:43,959
haven't started on that already please

00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:48,870
do diamonds and platinum is you get a

00:13:43,959 --> 00:13:52,839
full-page ad gold you get a half page ad

00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:57,430
for the web ad also do on the July 20th

00:13:52,839 --> 00:13:59,860
please keep in mind there you each

00:13:57,430 --> 00:14:02,769
diamond and platinum each key the same

00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:06,370
size and again if you follow this link

00:14:02,769 --> 00:14:08,589
you can see the specs here so for the

00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:13,029
print ad you'll notice that if you're a

00:14:08,589 --> 00:14:16,720
full page or if you're a half page you

00:14:13,029 --> 00:14:19,209
can find the specs here here are the

00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:21,850
specs for the dublin site or for the web

00:14:19,209 --> 00:14:24,490
ad this web ad is actually going to be

00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:28,240
on the home page of the Drupal con

00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:30,519
website so you know it's a pretty good

00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:34,720
benefit in the great part about it is is

00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:37,240
you can link it to whichever URL you

00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:39,940
want so when you have these ads ready

00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:42,490
please just send them directly to me and

00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:44,200
again the deadline for that is July 20th

00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:49,750
and if you

00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:54,390
were not aware when you click on these

00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:54,390
dates it'll actually take you to a

00:14:54,930 --> 00:15:00,910
calendar or a list to where you can see

00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:02,620
all the upcoming dates again many of

00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:04,900
them won't pertain to you but for the

00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:06,730
ones that do you can click this and you

00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:12,490
can copy it to your calendar so you

00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:17,250
don't forget the next thing I'd like to

00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:20,050
talk about is the tote bag item this one

00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:21,700
again doesn't apply to everyone applies

00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:23,860
the diamonds and platinum in the tote

00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:27,210
bag sponsor but this takes quite a bit

00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:30,390
of time as there are logistics involved

00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:33,370
the 2-day for this is July 16th

00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:36,250
you can add that from the DrupalCon

00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:39,870
calendar if you would like but basically

00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:42,580
what the Drupal arto bag item is is

00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:45,940
during registration each attendee will

00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:48,790
be handed a bag full of goodies from you

00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:51,700
guys this can be stickers it's gonna be

00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:54,370
a little tchotchke toys it can be

00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:58,420
pamphlets and flyers obviously the more

00:15:54,370 --> 00:16:01,240
attractive or unique the item the bigger

00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:05,080
the impact it's going to be on the

00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:08,440
attendee throwing fliers in there is an

00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:10,930
option but I bet most of them will be

00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:14,110
thrown away so please you're gonna take

00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:16,530
advantage of this benefit you know make

00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:16,530
it worthwhile

00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:28,340
the bags are relatively small however so

00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:31,350
you know a full-on poster panel or

00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:33,750
laptop might not be the best bet but

00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:36,360
there are some pretty unique cool

00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:38,810
smaller branded items that you can put

00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,810
out there

00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:43,930
the most important aspect of this is

00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:46,510
going to be the shipping but we'll get

00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:49,450
into that later just be sure to arrive

00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:53,380
by September 16th to the advance

00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:57,430
receiving warehouse for the name room

00:16:53,380 --> 00:17:00,100
and podium again this is only applies to

00:16:57,430 --> 00:17:02,680
diamonds and platinum I just want to

00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:05,620
make sure that just kind of point out

00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:08,470
what this is so each of these sponsors

00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:11,080
get a room named after them so if

00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:16,840
there's a session room this session room

00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:19,510
will be named sponsor - room number so

00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:21,370
if you are going to attend a session or

00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:25,420
if you submitted a session and it looks

00:17:21,370 --> 00:17:28,510
like this company is in your room it's

00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:33,340
not it's just a way to designate this

00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:35,260
area so if you want to see if you're

00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:38,770
looking at a map and you're getting lost

00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:44,950
you can say I'm looking for X sponsor

00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:48,000
room or you know X bar from whatever it

00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:50,470
may be but if you are a diamond or a

00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,570
platinum sponsor just go ahead and send

00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:55,240
me your print-ready vector logo and I'll

00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:57,790
take care of making sure your logo is

00:17:55,240 --> 00:18:01,900
represented on the maps and on the

00:17:57,790 --> 00:18:04,120
podium sides within this room the

00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:06,400
keynote introduction nothing that you

00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:08,650
anyone really needs to worry about here

00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:11,710
these are custom opportunities work

00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:14,200
directly with their respective sponsors

00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:17,670
but I do want to cover the Drupal

00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:21,010
showcase this is another difficult

00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:24,370
benefit to fulfill but probably the most

00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:26,620
advantageous if it's done right and more

00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:29,730
importantly if it's done in time and

00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:32,350
you'll notice the due date is actually

00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:34,660
tomorrow I've been working with a bit of

00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:41,350
you before but essentially we're the

00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:44,910
Drupal showcase is is a case study in

00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:49,690
which our sponsors have the options to

00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:52,300
present so you do not need to go through

00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:55,770
the selection process

00:18:52,300 --> 00:19:00,370
as they as a typical session goes

00:18:55,770 --> 00:19:02,470
however you do need to submit one so to

00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:04,750
find more information on that please

00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:06,700
follow this link because this link that

00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:09,310
you see here where it says submit your

00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:13,330
session this is a custom link only

00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:14,740
available to you as sponsors you can get

00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:18,400
an abstract of really what we're looking

00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:21,520
for again its case studies feel free to

00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:23,620
bring in your clients talk with you

00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:26,110
through these case studies so then go to

00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:30,250
submit a case study or submit a Drupal

00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:32,050
showcase you'll see if you have a gelato

00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:35,820
or account you'll be Auto populated

00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:38,940
there and click your abstract

00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:42,480
attaching and files make sure you

00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:44,430
designate the experience level but where

00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:46,200
it gets really specific as you need you

00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:51,060
scroll down here and select a Drupal

00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:53,130
showcase business sometimes gets

00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:55,350
confused

00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:59,580
so again just be sure you scroll down to

00:19:55,350 --> 00:20:03,030
such a tractable showcase and go ahead

00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:06,780
and save it and when this is done please

00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:09,120
let me know and send me a link to your

00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:11,220
submission and so I can publish it for

00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:16,110
you because right now submissions has

00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:18,240
closed but I do have the authority to

00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:19,620
publish it live for you because again as

00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:22,800
a sponsor these are automatically

00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:26,520
accepted but it's just important because

00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:30,930
the success of this session which can

00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:32,940
have a huge impact is based solely on

00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:34,740
the content you submit and whether

00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:37,230
people see it and people can't see it

00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:40,290
unless you submit it so please send

00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:44,190
those over to me and if you are a course

00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:47,610
sponsor we do actually have some time

00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:53,370
available if you do are interested in

00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:55,800
purchasing a a full 60 minute session we

00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:57,270
do not offer 30 minutes or 15 minute

00:20:55,800 --> 00:21:00,270
sessions for purchase but you can

00:20:57,270 --> 00:21:03,060
purchase a full 60 minute one this is a

00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:06,660
great opportunity to you know have some

00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:16,820
you to the right person

00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:21,740
the next

00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:23,780
I would like to talk about it's just a

00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:27,850
logo in the email so diamond and

00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:30,320
platinum get their logos included and

00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:32,330
attendee emails I'm sure if you're

00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:35,240
registered or if you've been to a coupon

00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:36,530
before you see these attendee emails so

00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:38,360
nothing you really need to worry about

00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:40,549
there unless you are a diamond and a

00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:43,179
platinum sponsor just go ahead and send

00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:43,179
me your logo

00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:50,530
the drupal newsletter so you'll see this

00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:50,530
down here

00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:56,390
Drupal Association newsletter post don't

00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:59,780
worry about it here because this really

00:21:56,390 --> 00:22:01,970
is done on an individual basis and I

00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:03,680
will work with you directly but the

00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:06,200
important thing here is to know this is

00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:09,500
a Drupal Association newsletter post not

00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:12,410
a Drupal con newsletter post so there's

00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:14,570
a difference there for on the other hand

00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:16,310
if you have an occlusion in it attendee

00:22:14,570 --> 00:22:19,010
email so if you're a diamond or if

00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:21,500
you're a platinum and you're one of the

00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:25,220
three to have claimed this benefit you

00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:29,000
do have the ability to send me some

00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:31,760
content it's limited to a certain

00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,770
character amount and it will be included

00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:36,290
in one of these Drupal con attendee

00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:38,300
emails please send me that by August

00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:41,720
28th and I will take care of that for

00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:43,820
you the next benefit I want to talk

00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:47,180
about is the attendee list because this

00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:50,150
does apply to quite a few of you

00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:52,340
the Timmy list is exactly what it sounds

00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:55,280
like it's a list of all the attendees in

00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:58,010
which I will send out to you however it

00:22:55,280 --> 00:23:00,770
only comes with the name company title

00:22:58,010 --> 00:23:05,300
and geographic information only there is

00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:06,800
no contact information and you want the

00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:08,990
contact information

00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:11,810
we won't provide it for you I'm sorry

00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:17,780
that's know we'd like to hold our

00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:20,240
attendees privacy true so we won't cross

00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:23,570
any boundaries there however when you do

00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:25,820
get the attendee list there is this

00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:28,700
community page so if you go to the

00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:37,250
DrupalCon website simply go to community

00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:39,980
look who's coming you can see public

00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:42,530
profiles everyone who has opted in to be

00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:44,900
on this public page you can see their

00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:46,880
job title you can see their names you

00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:51,980
don't see a picture of them but even

00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:56,510
better yet you can contact them directly

00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:58,040
so it's always good to just shout out

00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:58,320
who's coming because if you've never

00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:00,210
been

00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:02,580
- economy before there's a lot of people

00:24:00,210 --> 00:24:06,840
if you're interested in setting meetings

00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:09,240
with people who are interested and just

00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:10,980
general networking and you know the type

00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:14,029
of people that you want that community

00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:14,029
page is a great tool

00:24:15,610 --> 00:24:21,290
next part because would be the Drupal

00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:23,210
jobs credit because this does apply to

00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:26,210
everyone so this one's going to be a

00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:30,040
little bit more complicated on August 26

00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:33,050
I will be sending you a coupon code for

00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:36,380
Drupal jobs if no one if you have not

00:24:33,050 --> 00:24:39,920
been to Drupal jobs before it is a very

00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:43,160
very cool job board because it focuses

00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:45,830
on Drupal so if you are in need of a

00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:48,110
Drupal developer a Drupal front-end

00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:52,570
developer an architect a project manager

00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:52,570
sales person these job posts

00:24:52,990 --> 00:25:00,250
allow you to target these this talent

00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:02,679
which most of us know is pretty

00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:05,320
difficult to find out there so I'll be

00:25:02,679 --> 00:25:08,590
sending you a code and how it will work

00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:14,500
is you will go to Jupiter Jobs I drew

00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:16,150
blood or storm and as mentioned in the

00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:18,400
event kit you either are going to get

00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:20,950
five featured postings or 10 regular

00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:23,530
postings so most of you he'll have 10

00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:27,990
regular postings as well you'll need to

00:25:23,530 --> 00:25:27,990
do is you add one to the cart

00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:38,340
more all the way up until you reach the

00:25:33,309 --> 00:25:42,100
tin job credits mount you'll see this is

00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:44,260
$199 value per job so this is very

00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:46,210
valuable if you want but when you use

00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:48,910
this code it's important that you have

00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:51,100
all ten credit in your account as you

00:25:48,910 --> 00:25:56,860
proceed through checkout as this code

00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:59,590
will only apply to a specific value you

00:25:56,860 --> 00:26:02,440
need to use this code within 30 days or

00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:05,380
will expire however if you purchase all

00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:09,580
ten of these job credits they will live

00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:11,650
in your they will live in your Drupal

00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:13,660
jobs account until you use them so if

00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:15,940
you don't have a need for tin Drupal

00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:18,850
developers but you think you might later

00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:21,340
on please just redeem this coupon code

00:26:18,850 --> 00:26:24,790
in this coupon field as soon as you can

00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:26,919
add coupon you'll see all ten discounted

00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:36,760
down to zero in which you can proceed

00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:39,400
from there the next benefit I would like

00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:42,400
to cover real quick is the listing in

00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:46,510
the program guide so you'll see that

00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:48,669
right here very simple just send me over

00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:51,790
when you ideally when you're sending me

00:26:48,669 --> 00:26:54,370
your logo URL the name of your company

00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:57,490
how you wish it would how you wish for

00:26:54,370 --> 00:27:01,600
it to be listed in print so some people

00:26:57,490 --> 00:27:06,540
again have specific products they would

00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:08,710
like to push or abbreviations or

00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:10,860
capitalizations or spaces however maybe

00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:13,990
just make sure you send that over to me

00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:17,169
for the next one the logo on the main

00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:20,230
screen side nothing to do there aside

00:27:17,169 --> 00:27:22,390
from sending me the correct logo so I

00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:25,450
always recommend first thing you do send

00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:28,740
me a logo name and URL and it will take

00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:28,740
care of all these for you

00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:33,580
the benefit as a sponsor you get to

00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:35,310
provide trivia night prizes triple

00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:38,980
trivia is probably one of the most

00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:41,490
popular events during the whole

00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:44,290
conference and you as a sponsor have a

00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:48,520
opportunity to donate prices to be given

00:27:44,290 --> 00:27:51,310
away with AD tribution to you so the

00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:55,900
bigger and better the prize the bigger

00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:58,290
and better the impact simply bringing

00:27:55,900 --> 00:28:03,520
these items to the registration desk at

00:27:58,290 --> 00:28:06,630
DrupalCon the last benefit that I would

00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:10,840
like to cover is access to the VIP

00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:14,020
sponsor /border reception this happens

00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:17,470
on Wednesday of the DrupalCon after the

00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:19,990
day's activities at the venue it's

00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:23,820
pretty fancy a nice networking

00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:28,950
opportunity free beverages free snacks

00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:32,080
and as a sponsor you get a set amount of

00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:37,540
passes or tickets so if you haven't done

00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:40,210
so already you want to simply RSVP

00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:42,760
through this web form we've created here

00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:46,810
for you again you only get a certain

00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:50,770
amount of them so whoever you decide to

00:28:46,810 --> 00:28:52,240
sin make sure you know it's worthwhile a

00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:55,870
a lot of people like to send the

00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:58,180
executives or leadership or anyone else

00:28:55,870 --> 00:29:02,920
that it's important to network in front

00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:05,710
of some of the most from some of the

00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:08,620
most well recognized drupal figures

00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:11,650
within the community this is a great a

00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:14,200
great event I take a lot of pride in it

00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:19,410
so I would love to see all you guys

00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:19,410
attend and you know talk to you myself

00:29:19,630 --> 00:29:23,680
so again if you're not a core so now the

00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:26,320
next I want to talk about so if you're

00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:28,630
not a core so you are a lunch or a

00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:31,170
sprint sponsor or whatever maybe go to

00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:34,720
your specific sponsorship and you can

00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:38,130
find these exact same thing so all these

00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:41,560
module sponsorships are basically just a

00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:42,100
combination of the ones below so how'd

00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:44,679
everything

00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:48,210
tickets how to submit your program guy

00:29:44,679 --> 00:29:51,340
dad it's all there however if you are a

00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:53,440
lunch sponsor or any sort of sponsor

00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:56,320
that deals with catering so coffee lunch

00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:58,450
Sprint's opening receptions you have the

00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:00,549
option to provide branded catering items

00:29:58,450 --> 00:30:03,340
I just sort of quickly want to cover

00:30:00,549 --> 00:30:07,960
what that means so if you want your

00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:10,179
coffee be be served in a branded coffee

00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:11,650
cup with your logo on it you have the

00:30:10,179 --> 00:30:13,720
option to do that if you want too

00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:15,610
napkins to be served you have the

00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:18,549
options to do that but you are

00:30:15,610 --> 00:30:21,100
responsible for having the produced and

00:30:18,549 --> 00:30:25,780
for paying for them and then you have to

00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:29,049
ship them so there's information on how

00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:31,210
to ship them in decide this event kit

00:30:29,049 --> 00:30:32,980
but as far as procuring the items that

00:30:31,210 --> 00:30:34,570
it's up to you but this is a great

00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:39,700
benefit because it gets your brand in

00:30:34,570 --> 00:30:42,330
everyone's hand alright so the next

00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:47,020
thing I want to talk about is exhibiting

00:30:42,330 --> 00:30:49,929
so the first place to start here would

00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:52,809
be the exhibiting schedule so this

00:30:49,929 --> 00:30:56,860
basically is when is the exhibit hall

00:30:52,809 --> 00:31:02,400
open and when you need to be fully

00:30:56,860 --> 00:31:02,400
staffed and ready to go so that means

00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:08,530
when you should have max capacity staff

00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:11,049
to handle large traffic or you know

00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:13,350
maybe some time to relax a bit so the

00:31:11,049 --> 00:31:16,059
first thing we want to point out is that

00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:20,620
you can start setting up your booth on

00:31:16,059 --> 00:31:24,340
Monday September 26 at 12 o'clock you'll

00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:27,010
notice here from 12 to 15 is loading and

00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:31,440
set up meaning you are Willet you are

00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:34,870
able to load in any large material bags

00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:37,120
however maybe but at 15 o'clock that

00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:38,860
large garage door is closed and so

00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:40,419
you'll be forced to use the front door

00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:43,120
which is going to be a little bit more

00:31:40,419 --> 00:31:47,919
difficult but you can continue setting

00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:50,440
up all the way until 17 o'clock at which

00:31:58,470 --> 00:32:05,190
very important time to be fully set up

and fully staffed as the next two hours

00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:09,390

see the exhibit hall the entire

00:32:09,390 --> 00:32:13,919
conference this is due in part to this

00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:16,530
is the only thing happening in the

00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:18,870

00:32:26,130 --> 00:32:32,370
the rest of the days to have the sort of

00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:35,309
more rich conversations that you are

00:32:49,950 --> 00:32:56,940
public at 10:15 you will be able to come

00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:58,410

you are registering make sure that you

00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:10,290
indicate you are a sponsor and then it

00:33:06,450 --> 00:33:12,630
will be open until 18 o'clock I have

00:33:10,290 --> 00:33:15,500
these brakes highlighted because these

00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:15,500
will be the most

00:33:15,730 --> 00:33:21,130
the heavily traffic you did times of the

00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,720
day and these are the times of the day

00:33:21,130 --> 00:33:25,300
where you guys will want to be fully

00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:28,180
staffed at the booth while sessions and

00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:29,740
bobs and trainings are happening you

00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:33,340
know it's not as important there will be

00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:35,260
people but these braids specifically so

00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:38,710
at ten fifteen to eleven there'll be a

00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:41,470
large free coffee break this is going to

00:33:38,710 --> 00:33:43,690
be a pretty popular one so be staffed

00:33:41,470 --> 00:33:46,090
they're new this year there's going to

00:33:43,690 --> 00:33:49,510
be two lunches so basically from twelve

00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:51,880
to fourteen just stay ready you guys

00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:54,040
will have access to lunch before and

00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:55,780
after and you guys are always obviously

00:33:54,040 --> 00:34:00,100
welcome to grab the lunch during the

00:33:55,780 --> 00:34:03,130
lunch break so keep in mind that it's

00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:05,080
important during lunch to have as much

00:34:03,130 --> 00:34:07,840
staff as you can so people can grab

00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:12,160
lunch or you know communicate with

00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:15,490
attendees as needed and then from 15 15

00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:17,710
to 15 45 there will be a short break on

00:34:15,490 --> 00:34:22,990
Thursday it's essentially the same

00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:26,100
schedule until 1430 at which time you

00:34:22,990 --> 00:34:30,400
can begin tearing down and moving out

00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:34,360
and you have until 18 to be out of the

00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:36,669
exhibit a home enduring teardown and

00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:40,510
move out if you have outbound shipping

00:34:36,669 --> 00:34:44,590
needs your of course welcome to arranges

00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:47,200
through your own courier but our courier

00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:51,340
partner interflow can handle this for

00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:53,560
you they like to point out that you know

00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:56,260
dublin is pretty unique and complicated

00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:59,590
as far as you know crack filing and

00:34:56,260 --> 00:35:01,600
declaring for customs so they welcome

00:34:59,590 --> 00:35:08,530
all of you to contact them directly and

00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:10,930
work that out for them and just a quick

00:35:08,530 --> 00:35:12,850
overview because obviously it's nice to

00:35:10,930 --> 00:35:15,220
know where or what it's gonna look like

00:35:12,850 --> 00:35:17,650
you can find a link to the exhibit hall

00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:21,340
here and just see the general layout of

00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:23,080
the booth what you see here is these

00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:28,080
orange lines or where the buffets are

00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:30,040
going to be during lunch the blue is

00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:32,800
solid stations during

00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:35,800
lunch the red is coffee during lunch and

00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:39,060
during coffee breaks purple dots are

00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:41,590
going to be desert stations these blue

00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:44,050
food are going to be the shell boosts

00:35:41,590 --> 00:35:46,180
these tables on the side are going to be

00:35:44,050 --> 00:35:48,580
the silver tables and all these little

00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:51,640
grey dots in between our just general

00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:53,770
tables for people to sit at you can take

00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:59,230
it take a time to look at that if that's

00:35:53,770 --> 00:36:01,900
what interests you alright so now that

00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:05,110
we know what the layout look at like and

00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:09,220
what the exhibiting hours looks like

00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:11,260
it's kind of important to know how to go

00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:13,090
about customizing your booth again if

00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:18,730
you don't have a booth it probably won't

00:36:13,090 --> 00:36:22,210
matter to you but basically we have

00:36:18,730 --> 00:36:25,000
three partners we have hue Expo they are

00:36:22,210 --> 00:36:28,260
gonna be the ones managing your setup of

00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:31,660
your booth if you want to have

00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:35,970
customized furniture or customized

00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:38,620
booths in general or specific lighting

00:36:35,970 --> 00:36:40,750
audio-visual you order that from them

00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:45,040
and you can even work with them directly

00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:48,400
so basically just emu email Hugh himself

00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:50,080
and you guys can build custom boosts but

00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:53,890
again of course I mean they they will

00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:54,550
charge a fee for there but that is an

00:36:53,890 --> 00:36:57,430
option

00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:59,770
the next partner is the CCD or the

00:36:57,430 --> 00:37:01,360
Dublin Convention Center which is where

00:36:59,770 --> 00:37:05,620
the events going to be so if you are

00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:08,770
interested in caring hospitality audio

00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:13,630
or hardwired internet you'll want to do

00:37:08,770 --> 00:37:15,550
that through catering our other partner

00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:17,710
is inter flow which I've touched on

00:37:15,550 --> 00:37:21,040
inter flow is our shipping and logistics

00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:23,280
partner I'll cover that later but for

00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:28,390
now I just want to quickly walk through

00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:30,550
Hugh and the CCD as mentioned he was in

00:37:28,390 --> 00:37:33,880
charge of furniture rentals displays

00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:36,340
custom booths branding additional

00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:40,330
electrical needs the Lighting's than any

00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:42,880
printed panels or you know that custom

00:37:40,330 --> 00:37:44,079
fashion board I mentioned before so what

00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:49,329
they provide for you

00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:52,329
is a watering system it's just a general

00:37:49,329 --> 00:37:56,589
commerce site it's pretty easy to

00:37:52,329 --> 00:38:02,349
navigate so if you want a if you want to

00:37:56,589 --> 00:38:04,349
look at let's say specific furniture you

00:38:02,349 --> 00:38:08,410
have an ability to scroll through

00:38:04,349 --> 00:38:15,130
catalog style and add it to cart if you

00:38:08,410 --> 00:38:19,140
want to do some stand-up grade products

00:38:15,130 --> 00:38:22,869
so this is going to be if you want these

00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:25,029
printed counters or if you want your own

00:38:22,869 --> 00:38:28,200
graphics and design you can do this here

00:38:25,029 --> 00:38:28,200
you add it to cart and

00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:35,840
when you get to Add to Cart you'll be

00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:38,630
able to proceed to checkout

00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:41,530
you can input specific notes about how

00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:43,930
you want it to look you can attach files

00:38:41,530 --> 00:38:47,740
make sure you indicate that you are

00:38:43,930 --> 00:38:50,750
doing this for a DrupalCon dublin and

00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:52,670
then the thing I do want to point out is

00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:55,130
that you won't be able to order until

00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:59,270
you have been given an official booth

00:38:55,130 --> 00:39:01,580
number or Stan number we are underway

00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:04,910
with booth selection but official

00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:07,100
numbers have not been designated yet but

00:39:04,910 --> 00:39:09,860
we still have time so don't stress don't

00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:12,110
worry about it just know that this is

00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:14,900
there because the same thing is going to

00:39:12,110 --> 00:39:18,320
happen when you go through ordering

00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:20,240
catering through the CCI team so what's

00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:23,090
different though is you do have a show

00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:26,540
ID when you go to Kate are the CCD

00:39:23,090 --> 00:39:30,350
portal you're going to want to enter in

00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:34,730
the show ID here so I provided it you

00:39:30,350 --> 00:39:38,540
just simple copy/paste and you continue

00:39:34,730 --> 00:39:41,860
to exhibitor ordering again this is if

00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:46,040
you have a booth and you would like to

00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:47,960
order some sort of catering so I always

00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:49,730
recommend if you want people to come to

00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:52,520
your booth you know give them a reason

00:39:49,730 --> 00:39:56,930
to come so free food and drinks is

00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:58,880
always a good option you're going to

00:39:56,930 --> 00:40:00,560
need to create an account here so if you

00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:03,380
don't have an account created account

00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:07,880
and then go in and go ahead and login

00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:10,550
and you will have access to essentially

00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:15,350
another commerce portal in which you can

00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:17,690
order specific foods specific beverages

00:40:15,350 --> 00:40:23,050
alcoholic non-alcoholic you can order

00:40:17,690 --> 00:40:28,670
professional services such as bartending

00:40:23,050 --> 00:40:30,380
security cleaning but that's nice it's

00:40:28,670 --> 00:40:35,480
nice little tool there's also some

00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:37,160
additional audio-visual equipment you

00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:40,160
can order through them and hardwire

00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:43,040
internet and I want to stress out that

00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:48,110
you will need to order everything by

00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:49,760
September 9th to avoid a 25% surcharge

00:40:48,110 --> 00:40:54,260
this goes for Hugh and

00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:57,170
CCD again September 20 our September 9th

00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:58,730
but there is plenty of time so just

00:40:57,170 --> 00:41:01,670
because you don't have your booth number

00:40:58,730 --> 00:41:03,110
now doesn't mean you need to stress you

00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:05,060
don't have your booth number on

00:41:03,110 --> 00:41:08,420
September 8th yes you probably should

00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:10,220
stress but I'm going through boo

00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:16,310
selection as fast as possible and should

00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:19,040
have this information for you soon the

00:41:16,310 --> 00:41:21,290
next part I would like to cover as far

00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:23,510
as your sponsorship is going to be your

00:41:21,290 --> 00:41:26,270
shipping and handling information I

00:41:23,510 --> 00:41:28,700
mentioned before that our partner is

00:41:26,270 --> 00:41:30,230
interflow logistics their base right

00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:35,480
that are out of Dublin so they

00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:38,810
understand their customs and clearance

00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:40,670
needs more than anyone so I always

00:41:38,810 --> 00:41:43,550
recommend just contact them directly

00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:46,490
they are happy to help and they've been

00:41:43,550 --> 00:41:49,340
telling me to have you guys work with

00:41:46,490 --> 00:41:52,400
them directly here's all the contact

00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:54,410
information you need but if you have

00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:56,960
special needs or confused they're either

00:41:54,410 --> 00:41:58,840
going to be the ones to go to because

00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:02,680
essentially what I did is just

00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:05,210
consolidate the information from their

00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:07,940
document that you can find multiple

00:42:05,210 --> 00:42:11,660
times throughout here and put it in an

00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:14,360
easy to read format so yes you can find

00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:15,860
stuff in this event kit but again if you

00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:18,020
want the more specific detailed

00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:21,350
information I recommend just working

00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:24,140
with them so the first thing that I do

00:42:21,350 --> 00:42:26,390
want to cover is that they do provide a

00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:28,850
advanced warehouse so if you're shipping

00:42:26,390 --> 00:42:32,290
anything to be that you need at your

00:42:28,850 --> 00:42:37,990
booth or you need for your specific

00:42:32,290 --> 00:42:41,530
module sponsorship you can bring this in

00:42:37,990 --> 00:42:44,600
you can use your own courier but I

00:42:41,530 --> 00:42:46,640
highly highly highly highly recommend

00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:48,620
just shipping it to the advance

00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:50,450
warehouse because they will take care of

00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:55,490
making sure it's at your booth when you

00:42:50,450 --> 00:42:57,500
arrive or it's at the specific location

00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:58,970
of the venue depending on your

00:42:57,500 --> 00:43:03,150
sponsorship so please just ship

00:42:58,970 --> 00:43:09,330
everything to the advance warehouse

00:43:03,150 --> 00:43:13,350
you can see the address here and if you

00:43:09,330 --> 00:43:14,970
have a specific destination where you

00:43:13,350 --> 00:43:16,740
want to be say your shipping booth

00:43:14,970 --> 00:43:19,950
material we've even created these

00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:23,070
specific labels for you to use so just

00:43:19,950 --> 00:43:26,550
put your booth number what carrier how

00:43:23,070 --> 00:43:29,670
many boxes it is that you're using and

00:43:26,550 --> 00:43:32,630
the items will be at your booth when you

00:43:29,670 --> 00:43:39,000
arrive you're shipping a tote bag item

00:43:32,630 --> 00:43:42,090
you have your own special label here so

00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:47,310
always just designate what your sponsor

00:43:42,090 --> 00:43:50,610
is so who what's your sponsors name who

00:43:47,310 --> 00:43:52,980
the courier is and I always recommend if

00:43:50,610 --> 00:43:56,160
it's for your booth or for it's for tote

00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:57,900
bag or if it's for just general swag to

00:43:56,160 --> 00:44:01,110
be distributed at the summit source

00:43:57,900 --> 00:44:05,760
print right on the box as many places as

00:44:01,110 --> 00:44:08,130
you can your name what the item is and

00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:10,200
what the item is for so if it's for

00:44:08,130 --> 00:44:11,940
booth say it's for the booth it's for

00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:14,070
the tote bag say for the tote bag and

00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:17,310
label it everywhere you can on the

00:44:14,070 --> 00:44:20,940
outside because when you're putting on

00:44:17,310 --> 00:44:22,230
event handling about handling hundreds

00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:24,900
and hundreds of shipments you know

00:44:22,230 --> 00:44:26,820
sometimes it gets confusing and so if

00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:29,730
you're shipping Catering them from a are

00:44:26,820 --> 00:44:33,210
free shipping items for you you know

00:44:29,730 --> 00:44:35,730
Brandi catering sponsorship you have

00:44:33,210 --> 00:44:38,160
your own label as well but just be sure

00:44:35,730 --> 00:44:41,370
that this you designate saying this is

00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:44,430
for a Tuesday coffee or for the Monday

00:44:41,370 --> 00:44:49,440
first-time attendee social again more

00:44:44,430 --> 00:44:51,570
details of the better and pure there are

00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:53,610
deadlines associated with this I pulled

00:44:51,570 --> 00:44:57,360
them out here but again you can be found

00:44:53,610 --> 00:45:01,920
in the document so our show dates are 27

00:44:57,360 --> 00:45:05,130
through 29 depending on which transport

00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:07,110
method you are taking your need to be

00:45:05,130 --> 00:45:12,000
ten days eighteen days or five days

00:45:07,110 --> 00:45:15,060
three days before the requested delivery

00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:16,980
date but I just recommend ship

00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:20,810
everything between

00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:24,210
September 16th and September 22nd

00:45:20,810 --> 00:45:28,099
deadlines certain deadlines do apply and

00:45:24,210 --> 00:45:33,480
once you pass this depending on which

00:45:28,099 --> 00:45:36,300
which method you're using if you go

00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:38,640
beyond this 18 days or this five days

00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:42,480
you will be charged a twenty five

00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:44,400
percent surcharge so on top of your

00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:46,680
general costs you will be charged twenty

00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:51,200
five percent more so pay attention to

00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:52,440
these dates add them to your calendars

00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:54,119
again

00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:57,150
you can find the shipping and guidelines

00:45:54,119 --> 00:45:58,680
and ordering forms here so everyone's

00:45:57,150 --> 00:46:02,369
going to need to order shipping and

00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:04,079
handling order them the transferring and

00:46:02,369 --> 00:46:09,450
this is where you can do it so simply

00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:13,369
fill out the booking form so exhibition

00:46:09,450 --> 00:46:16,170
DrupalCon Paul Isabel both number

exhibitor so that's your name all this

00:46:16,170 --> 00:46:20,700
information I don't know for you but I'm

00:46:18,630 --> 00:46:23,940
sure you can figure it out here is your

00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:27,150
payment information and then you also

00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:30,150

customs there's a little bit more detail

00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:41,670
pulled out here on what that means and

00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:43,230
then you have the costs associated with

00:46:41,670 --> 00:46:45,270
it so there's two documents here they're

00:46:43,230 --> 00:46:48,510

00:46:45,270 --> 00:46:51,180

00:46:48,510 --> 00:46:53,099
needed how to order it and then if

00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:56,450
you're interested on how much it's going

00:46:53,099 --> 00:46:58,210

00:47:07,099 --> 00:47:13,430
general overview of the event so about

00:47:10,599 --> 00:47:17,809

prices vary in each hotel accommodates

00:48:19,990 --> 00:48:26,740
to your specific needs the farthest ones

00:48:23,260 --> 00:48:30,040
ten minute walk from the venue so that's

00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:35,530
nice but if five minutes is a huge deal

00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:38,380
go ahead and do this one each Hotel has

00:48:35,530 --> 00:48:40,300

how you take advantage of that discount

00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:55,410
again we've done this for you guys we

00:48:53,319 --> 00:48:59,500
want to make sure everyone has a

00:48:55,410 --> 00:49:02,430
affordable time and it can be in the

00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:05,710
thick of the action without having to

00:49:02,430 --> 00:49:08,829
you know go to a hostel or do whatever

00:49:05,710 --> 00:49:12,160
it needs to be so the main hotel will be

00:49:08,829 --> 00:49:15,940
the Gibson this is where the 24 sprint

00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:17,619
lounge will be this is where majority of

00:49:15,940 --> 00:49:19,180
the attendees will stay so if you're

00:49:17,619 --> 00:49:22,869
interested in being in that that's where

00:49:19,180 --> 00:49:25,619
you want to go the next thing I want to

00:49:22,869 --> 00:49:28,859
cover and last thing is just the general

00:49:25,619 --> 00:49:31,660
programming of DrupalCon

00:49:28,859 --> 00:49:33,550
many of you have probably been digital

00:49:31,660 --> 00:49:37,839
cons before or been to conferences

00:49:33,550 --> 00:49:40,069
similar so you understand so to start

00:49:37,839 --> 00:49:45,519
what is a session

00:49:40,069 --> 00:49:45,519
is generally as basically a a

00:49:45,819 --> 00:49:55,670
educational or training period you will

00:49:51,650 --> 00:49:59,719
have a speaker so it's not conversation

00:49:55,670 --> 00:50:01,819
as much as it is a presentation but then

00:49:59,719 --> 00:50:03,709
there's specific tracks so if you want

00:50:01,819 --> 00:50:07,849
to just learn about being human so this

00:50:03,709 --> 00:50:11,329
is you know we all work digitally are

00:50:07,849 --> 00:50:14,599
within the digital systems and spend a

00:50:11,329 --> 00:50:16,849
lot of times on the computer but you

00:50:14,599 --> 00:50:18,170
know it's important to reflect and like

00:50:16,849 --> 00:50:21,619
you know these are humans that are

00:50:18,170 --> 00:50:23,299
building this great project then you can

00:50:21,619 --> 00:50:25,309
go all the way down to coding

00:50:23,299 --> 00:50:30,170
development if that's what you want

00:50:25,309 --> 00:50:32,359
mostly sessions will be an hour long we

00:50:30,170 --> 00:50:35,449
try to make it so there's something that

00:50:32,359 --> 00:50:37,069
interests everyone if you are respecting

00:50:35,449 --> 00:50:40,309
or if you have clients that are

00:50:37,069 --> 00:50:42,650
attending you know we always recommend

00:50:40,309 --> 00:50:44,359
sending them to these the tuple

00:50:42,650 --> 00:50:47,329
showcases the sponsor one that's

00:50:44,359 --> 00:50:49,099
probably good one to you know have your

00:50:47,329 --> 00:50:52,190
prospects or clients that tend to learn

00:50:49,099 --> 00:50:54,829
a little bit more about Drupal the next

00:50:52,190 --> 00:50:56,569
thing our boss our birds our feather you

00:50:54,829 --> 00:51:00,109
notice they're not here yet so these are

00:50:56,569 --> 00:51:01,339
going to be the more conversation types

00:51:00,109 --> 00:51:04,579
they're smaller

00:51:01,339 --> 00:51:07,069
there's no presenter but there is a

00:51:04,579 --> 00:51:09,979
facilitator and it's just going to be

00:51:07,069 --> 00:51:12,650
conversations around with people that

00:51:09,979 --> 00:51:15,410
feel passionate about about a similar

00:51:12,650 --> 00:51:18,499
topic or just have the same sort of

00:51:15,410 --> 00:51:22,339
questions revolving a certain topic once

00:51:18,499 --> 00:51:24,259
those open up you are welcome to submit

00:51:22,339 --> 00:51:27,469
it and it's basically first-come

00:51:24,259 --> 00:51:30,199
first-serve if you see an open room you

00:51:27,469 --> 00:51:34,219
click on that room and put the title in

00:51:30,199 --> 00:51:35,749
put a abstract and you know as they say

00:51:34,219 --> 00:51:37,880
if you build it they will come

00:51:35,749 --> 00:51:39,799
so if you are really passionate about

00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:42,499
something there's probably a good chance

00:51:39,799 --> 00:51:47,809
that someone else's or if your company

00:51:42,499 --> 00:51:50,299
has questions or issues and you think

00:51:47,809 --> 00:51:52,009
other people do submit that boff when

00:51:50,299 --> 00:51:53,830
you have a chance and it's a good chance

00:51:52,009 --> 00:51:58,930
for you to

00:51:53,830 --> 00:52:00,820
get into some really really important

00:51:58,930 --> 00:52:03,510
conversations that need to be held at

00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:06,280
Joe pecan that's what it's here for it a

00:52:03,510 --> 00:52:09,220
physical get-together of the Drupal

00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:12,390
community when these conversations needs

00:52:09,220 --> 00:52:15,840
be had we hope that their had here

00:52:12,390 --> 00:52:20,550
trainings so trainings happen on Monday

00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:22,690
before the actual programming starts

00:52:20,550 --> 00:52:26,350
trainings is just what it sounds like

00:52:22,690 --> 00:52:29,440
their training classes they're gonna be

00:52:26,350 --> 00:52:32,710
more developer development focused so if

00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:36,610
we front and back in DevOps Drupal a

00:52:32,710 --> 00:52:38,560
twig whatever maybe once this trainings

00:52:36,610 --> 00:52:40,750
are announced you'll be able to purchase

00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:42,760
tickets to attend these or purchase them

00:52:40,750 --> 00:52:47,380
for your developers for a little bit of

00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:49,210
a professional development summits are

00:52:47,380 --> 00:52:55,260
also going to happen on Monday so these

00:52:49,210 --> 00:52:58,359
are vertical specific get-togethers

00:52:55,260 --> 00:53:00,940
again similar to a ball fits these are

00:52:58,359 --> 00:53:03,220
much larger than boss they happen all

00:53:00,940 --> 00:53:05,560
day but it's going to be more

00:53:03,220 --> 00:53:08,080
conversational there is a facilitator

00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:13,750
but if you're interested or you work in

00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:17,200
the higher education industry or

00:53:13,750 --> 00:53:20,590
government industry and you want to talk

00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:23,770
with the fellow people that work in the

00:53:20,590 --> 00:53:27,580
same industry as you and you want to see

00:53:23,770 --> 00:53:31,320
why Drupal is you know the chosen

00:53:27,580 --> 00:53:34,660
platform or if you want to talk about

00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:37,180
questions or concerns that you have

00:53:34,660 --> 00:53:39,500
I recommend attending these these are

00:53:37,180 --> 00:53:43,349
you know

00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:45,200
these are some of the most rich

00:53:43,349 --> 00:53:49,440
conversations that you'll have all day

00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:52,319
yes it is a long day 9 to 17 but it's

00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:55,170
more than worth it you want to attend

00:53:52,319 --> 00:53:58,950
the business summit this is a chance for

00:53:55,170 --> 00:54:01,440
you to meet and share your concerns with

00:53:58,950 --> 00:54:03,569
other fellow Drupal shop so if you're a

00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:05,910
Google agency these are going to be the

00:54:03,569 --> 00:54:09,089
owners and executives of these that are

00:54:05,910 --> 00:54:12,180
their lifestyle and their the success of

00:54:09,089 --> 00:54:14,250
the business lives with Drupal if you're

00:54:12,180 --> 00:54:16,559
in DevOps or if you just want to learn

00:54:14,250 --> 00:54:19,829
about how to get into the Drupal

00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:22,559
community attend these they do have a

00:54:19,829 --> 00:54:29,339
fee but the community some is free again

00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:31,200
these happen on Monday and so now I just

00:54:29,339 --> 00:54:36,839
kind of want to cover the schedule at a

00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:39,029
glance so just a quick rundown of what

00:54:36,839 --> 00:54:40,890
the week's activities will look like

00:54:39,029 --> 00:54:43,650

be a first-timer but this could be a

00:55:21,450 --> 00:55:27,029
good place for you to meet first-timers

00:55:23,430 --> 00:55:28,859

00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:30,750
that the keno is a community keynote

best it's not trivia night it's drupal

00:56:57,990 --> 00:57:03,300

00:57:00,750 --> 00:57:05,520
right there and then on Friday all the

00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:07,410

00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:09,480
you're a company send in all your

00:57:07,410 --> 00:57:11,790
developers have them reppin your brand

00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:14,340
brand insurance logo shirts wherever

00:57:11,790 --> 00:57:16,440
maybe because this is one of the most

00:57:14,340 --> 00:57:20,100
critical aspects of Drupal con is

00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:22,890
important that people within a Drupal

00:57:20,100 --> 00:57:26,040
community get together in person and fix

00:57:22,890 --> 00:57:28,830
issues or innovate on the Drupal project

00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:30,920
so if you're a first-timer those stuff

00:57:28,830 --> 00:57:33,630
for you if you're interested in

00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:36,780
contributing to core there's going to be

00:57:33,630 --> 00:57:38,970
people there to teach you how and then

00:57:36,780 --> 00:57:41,490
there's gonna be general sprints I'm

00:57:38,970 --> 00:57:46,470
sure most of your developers are going

00:57:41,490 --> 00:57:49,950
to be aware of that all right that was a

00:57:46,470 --> 00:57:52,500
lot to talk about and there will be

00:57:49,950 --> 00:57:55,020
another webcast that's going to be how

00:57:52,500 --> 00:57:58,410
to maximize your sponsorship investment

00:57:55,020 --> 00:58:01,400
happening on the 31st of August this

00:57:58,410 --> 00:58:05,920
one's gonna be more about strategy

00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:11,549
preparation follow-ups goals basically

00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:14,349
how to maximize each of your benefits

00:58:11,549 --> 00:58:16,710
beyond just the general fulfillment on

00:58:14,349 --> 00:58:19,809
when things are due turn it in time etc

00:58:16,710 --> 00:58:23,380
so it's gonna be a little bit more

00:58:19,809 --> 00:58:25,329
in-depth what DrupalCon is all about

00:58:23,380 --> 00:58:27,280
what Drupal is all about how to reach

00:58:25,329 --> 00:58:30,339
the audience that you want to reach from

00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:32,890
a marketing and business perspective how

00:58:30,339 --> 00:58:35,410
to create your business objectives

00:58:32,890 --> 00:58:36,099
that are in line with the Drupal

00:58:35,410 --> 00:58:37,960
community

00:58:36,099 --> 00:58:39,430
so again if you're interested in that

00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:44,020
especially if you're a first-time

00:58:39,430 --> 00:58:47,079
sponsor please attend but I think I

00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:49,329
mentioned before both of this webcast

00:58:47,079 --> 00:58:51,220
and the next one will be recorded so you

00:58:49,329 --> 00:58:56,799
all have access to that on our YouTube

00:58:51,220 --> 00:58:58,869
channel I like this one because it

00:58:56,799 --> 00:59:02,829
really does get into the meat and

00:58:58,869 --> 00:59:05,380
potatoes behind your sponsorship and

00:59:02,829 --> 00:59:08,829
finally I'd like to say thank you again

00:59:05,380 --> 00:59:12,250
because as I mentioned time and time and

00:59:08,829 --> 00:59:13,210
again without your support this event

00:59:12,250 --> 00:59:15,730
what happened

00:59:13,210 --> 00:59:19,599
these critical conversations would not

00:59:15,730 --> 00:59:21,790
be taking place between the Drupal minds

00:59:19,599 --> 00:59:23,319
out there and these Sprint's would not

00:59:21,790 --> 00:59:27,839
be able to happen to fix these issues

00:59:23,319 --> 00:59:30,700
and really we wouldn't be able to

00:59:27,839 --> 00:59:32,859
witness the Drupal community at its

00:59:30,700 --> 00:59:34,869
finest so thank you so much for what you

00:59:32,859 --> 00:59:38,150

00:59:34,869 --> 00:59:39,859

webcast and I hope to see you in the
