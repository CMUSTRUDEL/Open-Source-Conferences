Title: DrupalCon Dublin 2016: Drupal 8 Blocks: Who Knew?
Publication date: 2016-09-27
Playlist: DrupalCon Dublin 2016
Description: 
	In Drupal 7, for all but the most simple sites it seemed like no one used the core Block system. If you wanted to manage any kind of complicated layout you probably used Panels or the Context module.

Luckily for Drupal 8 the Block system has been vastly improved by a few key features:

Blocks are exportable
Blocks can be placed multiple times
Fieldable Blocks are in core
Blocks use Condition plugins
This session will look at how we can use these and other changes to the Block system in Drupal 8 as powerful site building tools. We will look at some smaller contrib modules in Drupal 8, likeÂ Block Visibility Groups, that will make the Block system even better. This session will focus on simpler solutions that don't abandon the Block administration page altogether but make it much better.

We will also look at changes to the Block system that will be added to Drupal 8.2 and changes that are being planned for the near future.

Audience:

This session is anyone is interested in building sites in Drupal 8.

um so this is Drupal 8 blocks who knew

00:00:04,009 --> 00:00:13,679
or Drupal 8 blocks who needs panels or

00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:16,529
Drupal 7 blocks grrrrrr so my name is

00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:19,260
ted bowman i'm ted bo on drupal.org i

00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:23,430
work at aqua for the office of the CTO

00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:26,369
sewed raises the CTO so i get to work on

00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:27,810
cool Drupal 8 core stuff like some of

00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:31,619
the stuff that need demo this morning

00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:35,880
the settings tray so the outside end

00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:37,770
concept in general the rest module the

00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:39,480
waterwheel the Drupal part of the

00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:41,760
waterwheel module which is a JavaScript

00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:43,829
library so I work on the Drupal

00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,989
integration of that I've worked on

00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:48,000
controls in the past energy forum

00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:51,949
scheduled updates as a new one I have on

00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,600
Twitter I'm everywhere else I'm Ted bow

00:00:51,949 --> 00:00:56,340
so who are you so it was a smaller

00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:59,039
presentation I would just ask everybody

00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:02,390
to come up and say hi but generally how

00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:05,970
many people are new to Drupal completely

00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:09,810
okay how many people have starting to

00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:11,100
work on Drupal 8 yet okay I guess be

00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:13,680
easier how many people have not started

00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:17,670
to work on Jubilee yeah okay so most

00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:20,759
people have okay all right so Drupal 7

00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:24,630
blocks why did we need more so basically

00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:29,280
why was core blocks not enough for for

00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:31,520
most of us for Drupal 7 so Drupal 7

00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:34,200
blocks one we're not features friendly

00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:36,060
so I'm going to go through a quick list

00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,290
of the things that I think of the pain

00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:39,630
points and we're going to look at them

00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:44,250
individually and then how Drupal 8

00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:46,770
solves that from those problems drupal 8

00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:48,960
or Drupal 8 plus your blade contribs so

00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:51,240
just sort of note on this presentation

00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,130
i'm not i'm going to sort of delve on

00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:54,780
what you can do with drupal 8 core

00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:57,390
blocks in just a little bit more as

00:01:54,780 --> 00:02:00,000
opposed to the larger ecosystems of

00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:02,579
modules that might exist but we'll talk

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,380
about those two so they weren't features

00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:07,320
friendly they weren't really easy to

00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:10,349
export with features each block could

00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:13,860
only be placed once there were limited

00:02:10,349 --> 00:02:16,110
visibility conditions blocks were not

00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:23,520
feel double without a whole bunch of

00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:27,180
other modules go wrong direction and not

00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:30,210
everything was a block and the blocks

00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:31,440
admin screen for me cause wasn't I felt

00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:33,300
like it was hard to manage a really

00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:37,980
complex site just with the blocks admin

00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:41,280
screen so for most complex sites a lot

00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:43,230
of people would use panels or context or

00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:47,610
and/or context I guess Lee sometimes

00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:49,800
people use both so caveat for me I was

00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:51,270
really in the panel's camp so this may

00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:54,300
be an American thing but that's mr.

00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:56,450
kool-aid so I drank the kool-aid which

00:02:54,300 --> 00:03:00,600
means you know I was really into panels

00:02:56,450 --> 00:03:03,120
for Drupal 7 I found so panels was super

00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:06,090
powerful tons of installs crazy

00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:08,220
configurable but you know it was really

00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:10,950
complex and it had a steep learning

00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:13,080
curve and it was really complex even I

00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:14,459
think just with panels itself and there

00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:17,070
were a lot of great modules in the

00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:18,780
panel's ecosystem that added more

00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:21,330
functionality but you know the more you

00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:24,030
added the sort of harder got to

00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:27,120
understand like I said I drank the

00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:29,459
kool-aid I you know I liked it but it

00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,830
was I'd also used to be a Drupal trainer

00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:34,830
and it was sort of hard to explain what

00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:36,810
was going on in panels so this is just

00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:38,790
the configuration of Drupal 7 panels I

00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:44,100
think which is maybe one or two other

00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:46,140
panels modules installed so Drupal's 7

00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:49,500
context was powerful some might say

00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:51,510
super powerful I kind of actually came

00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:54,720
to context later on in the Drupal 7

00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:57,420
cycle I came to really like its

00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:59,220
simplicity I think for most people for

00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:02,310
placing blocks it was easier to

00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:06,209
understand because it was closer to the

00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:09,900
core block system so this is just the

00:04:06,209 --> 00:04:11,579
screen for placing blocks via context so

00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:13,320
drew from seven blocks so why do we need

00:04:11,579 --> 00:04:15,660
panels on context let's look at the

00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:18,329
individual problems so not features

00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:20,400
friendly so really you want to be able

00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:22,710
to do configuration in Drupal commit it

00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:25,860
to get move it from dev stage to

00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:27,690
production in Drupal 7 if you didn't

00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:30,180
have something the features extra mile

00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:32,550
module or I think there was a blocks

00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:34,650
features module if you didn't have one

00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:36,180
of those modules at least for most of

00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:38,700
the Drupal 7 cycle it may have been

00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:40,860
improved later on you couldn't easily

00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:42,900
export your blocks so you might have to

00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:45,420
set them up locally and then actually

00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:46,320
set them on production which is if

00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:48,900
you're considering them your

00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:54,300
configuration is not the best practice

00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:56,010
and not ideal so Drupal 8 blocks our

00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:57,780
configuration entities they're really

00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:59,940
easy exportable so this kind of

00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:02,400
piggybacks on a lot of what i'm going to

00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:04,140
say that's good about Drupal 8 blocks is

00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,640
how the block system is kind of

00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:08,520
piggybacking on a whole lot of other

00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:11,820
changes in Drupal 8 so the configuration

00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:13,410
management system in this case so blocks

00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:16,560
are configuration entities they're

00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:19,170
really too easy to export very get

00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:21,180
friendly and you have one file per block

00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:24,440
so let's look what that looks like this

00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:26,880
is a screenshot of a directory of

00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:29,310
configuration I'm just looking here at

00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:32,340
the block so it's probably hard to read

00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:36,630
but we have block block barczak search

00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:39,419
bloc logic verchick bartok tools so each

00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:42,720
one of these is an individual block

00:05:39,419 --> 00:05:44,600
placement and so for me right away this

00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:47,340
is I like this better because in

00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:48,750
features you would have multiple block

00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:50,910
configurations if you had the block

00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:53,400
features extra module in one file and

00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:55,580
it's a lot easier to have get merge

00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:58,830
conflicts when you're doing it that way

00:05:55,580 --> 00:06:01,530
this is an individual block

00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:05,100
configuration file so it's a yam o file

00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:08,340
it's pretty easy to read so if we looked

00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:10,169
at this it says theme seven region

00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:13,020
header so it's really easy for me to

00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:14,880
just look and have an idea what this

00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:17,100
block configuration placement is

00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:20,510
actually doing so I'm going to show a

00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:23,130
real quick screencast of me basically

00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:26,100
going and making a change to a block

00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:27,540
committing it to get and then we're

00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:30,360
actually looking at the differences and

00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:32,480
then committing it to get so under this

00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:35,220
scenario here i have my configuration

00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:38,690
directory under my git repo so i can

00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:38,690
immediately see what changes are there

00:06:39,819 --> 00:06:46,099
so first I'm just going out there and

00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:48,349
I'm saying what's my get status so I

00:06:46,099 --> 00:06:50,509
want to see oh my status is clean

00:06:48,349 --> 00:06:52,490
meaning I don't have any configuration

00:06:50,509 --> 00:06:56,240
out there that I haven't committed to

00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:59,240
get yet and let's just assume in this

00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,860
example I've exported all the other

00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:02,569
changes in configuration that I've made

00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:04,250
now time coming and I want to update

00:07:02,569 --> 00:07:07,699
something about my site in this case

00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:08,690
we're a block is placed so the first

00:07:07,699 --> 00:07:11,389
thing I'm going to do is I'm going to go

00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:13,819
to my site i'm going to edit this block

00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:16,130
and i'm going to go down to the bottom

00:07:13,819 --> 00:07:19,039
and i'm just going to switch the region

00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:21,800
to sidebar first from sidebar second i

00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:24,440
save it i confirm yes it shows up over

00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:27,789
there we're all great so now i go back

00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:31,449
to my terminal and I dude rush configure

00:07:27,789 --> 00:07:34,669
export sink so basically I'm saying

00:07:31,449 --> 00:07:38,270
export my current site configuration to

00:07:34,669 --> 00:07:40,130
the sink directory which is a pretty I

00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:44,419
think the default directory name for

00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:45,919
Drupal 8 configuration once i do that

00:07:44,419 --> 00:07:48,259
it's actually going to ask me it's like

00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:52,849
hey there's one file that has changed

00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:56,840
and if it said something like I don't

00:07:52,849 --> 00:07:58,099
know node content type article i would

00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:00,500
say hey something went really wrong

00:07:58,099 --> 00:08:02,990
there but I see oh no it says block

00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:05,090
block bartok search just the name is

00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:07,430
going to tell me like oh it's reasonable

00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:12,259
what just happened so I'm going to

00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:14,930
export it and immediately I can actually

00:08:12,259 --> 00:08:17,900
just do a git status here and I can say

00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:20,090
what's going on in my file system and I

00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:21,770
can say oh there's one change file in my

00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:25,819
file system same one that they mentioned

00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:27,889
above if I actually want to see what

00:08:25,819 --> 00:08:34,310
that difference is I can just do a git

00:08:27,889 --> 00:08:36,260
diff and again since I only have one

00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:39,229
it's just going to show me the one file

00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:42,289
its going to say eliminated the line

00:08:39,229 --> 00:08:46,190
region second side bar and then it added

00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:49,250
the line Regent sidebar first so it's

00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:51,410
really easy for me to tell and get to

00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:53,480
sort of in my mind yes this is what I

00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:55,910
did it seems reasonable

00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:57,829
I felt like four features you know I

00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:59,660
love features for drupal I loved and

00:08:57,829 --> 00:09:03,019
hate hated features for Drupal 7

00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:04,670
depending on the day yeah but I mean it

00:09:03,019 --> 00:09:06,260
was it made things it made things

00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:08,930
possible that wasn't possible without it

00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:10,730
but the get differences when you're

00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:12,260
doing stuff like that we're not as clean

00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:15,199
it's just like okay I can really see

00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:16,760
just one small line changed the other

00:09:15,199 --> 00:09:19,310
important part is because it's not in

00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:20,990
one big file if somebody else made a

00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:24,139
change to another block and then we're

00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:25,459
merging those things in its we're not

00:09:24,139 --> 00:09:28,190
going to have any kind of merge conflict

00:09:25,459 --> 00:09:31,639
unless they edit the same block and

00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:35,120
really the same line even which is no

00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:37,100
could happen but not as likely and then

00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:40,250
I would just do a git commit message and

00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:42,019
say hey I you know obviously you're

00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:44,180
probably not more changes than just that

00:09:42,019 --> 00:09:45,920
but I'm just going to say well I move

00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:48,290
the search bloc I'm going to misspell it

00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:50,630
here and then you know then I'm good to

00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:52,250
go we're not going to get into the whole

00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:53,990
product the workflow for getting it up

00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:56,300
there but basically you know I could

00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:58,160
push those changes up other developers

00:09:56,300 --> 00:10:05,720
can pull them down and then we could

00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:07,819
pull them down from production okay so

00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:09,050
we're going to have questions later on

00:10:07,819 --> 00:10:10,850
but if anybody had any particular

00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:15,560
question on the workflow that type of

00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:20,660
workflow so we'll go over more later all

00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:22,399
right okay so another problem with

00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:24,800
Drupal 7 blocks were there's really

00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:29,089
limited visibility settings so if you

00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:30,769
ever use panels you could four panels

00:10:29,089 --> 00:10:32,360
variants you could use a lot of

00:10:30,769 --> 00:10:35,720
different conditions to say when should

00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:37,579
this variant take be used and then for

00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:39,170
each individual thing you placed in

00:10:37,579 --> 00:10:41,600
panels you could also have visibility

00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:43,310
settings that were really complex to say

00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,470
this should show only show up for

00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:47,959
anonymous users or this should only show

00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:51,560
up if the note i'm looking at is an

00:10:47,959 --> 00:10:53,630
article so drupal 7 core though in the

00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:55,339
block form had very limited visibility

00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:59,149
settings i could say on a certain

00:10:55,339 --> 00:11:03,050
content type i could say for a certain

00:10:59,149 --> 00:11:06,079
roles I could say uncertain pass but not

00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:06,920
not much more than that but Drupal and

00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:14,029
that you know may

00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:17,389
sad but Drupal 8 has also limited

00:11:14,029 --> 00:11:19,370
visibility settings so you know what is

00:11:17,389 --> 00:11:22,070
going on here why do we have the same

00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:26,029
limited visibility settings in Drupal

00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:27,380
core actually Drupal 8 has unlimited

00:11:26,029 --> 00:11:29,060
visibility sighting so this is also

00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:30,500
Drupal 8 and you can see over on the

00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:31,820
Left we have a whole bunch of different

00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:35,480
conditions that we can apply to that

00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:38,120
block so what is happening here this is

00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:41,180
both Drupal core one with very limited

00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:44,420
visibility settings and one with sort of

00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:46,339
unlimited visibility settings so what's

00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:48,500
going on so what we're looking at here

00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:51,320
with tons of visibility settings is

00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:54,190
actually Drupal core and see tools so

00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:57,050
see tools provides condition plugins and

00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:59,149
actually the reason see tools provides

00:11:57,050 --> 00:12:02,060
condition plugins is because panels

00:11:59,149 --> 00:12:03,620
needs condition plugins in Drupal 8 so

00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:06,620
instead of putting those condition

00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:09,290
plugins in panels itself it puts it in

00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:12,290
see tools and then panels depends on

00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:14,750
CTools so that's a really and then other

00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:17,899
modules like rules would also do that

00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:21,320
too so in Drupal 8 visibility settings

00:12:17,899 --> 00:12:23,300
are just condition plugins and then see

00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:25,640
tools will make the condition plugins

00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:27,980
but then core automatically gets them

00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:32,199
because condition plugins are sort of a

00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:35,120
generic thing in Drupal 8 so in Drupal 7

00:12:32,199 --> 00:12:37,310
context had condition visibility

00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:41,060
settings panels had visibility settings

00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:42,980
another and the rules had conditions so

00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:45,649
all of those in Drupal 7 were totally

00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:49,579
separate things and drupal 8 they all

00:12:45,649 --> 00:12:52,730
implement a can condition plugins so if

00:12:49,579 --> 00:12:55,190
you make it for one module another part

00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:57,290
will automatically get it so the fact

00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:58,760
that see tools provides these even

00:12:57,290 --> 00:13:00,949
though they were thinking well we're

00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:03,040
making these four panels even if you

00:13:00,949 --> 00:13:06,769
don't install panels you still get that

00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:12,019
added bonus I was going to start the

00:13:06,769 --> 00:13:16,810
timer you sort of remind me at 15 till

00:13:12,019 --> 00:13:16,810
yeah how much time do we have left now

00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:29,510
okay okay all right so and if none of

00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:32,070
the condition plugins that any

00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:34,350
contribute or Core provides is good

00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:36,720
enough for you condition plugins are

00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:38,580
basically in one class and this is

00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,200
pretty much the logic you would need I

00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:42,780
think this is for checking if it's a

00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:45,620
particular content type but you

00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:49,010
basically just have to implement the

00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:51,900
plug-in and overwrite the evaluate

00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:54,720
method and you commit any kind of logic

00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:57,150
you want in here to basically if you had

00:13:54,720 --> 00:14:00,350
very special business logic it's really

00:13:57,150 --> 00:14:02,790
easy to write your own condition plugins

00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:04,520
so another problem with triple seven is

00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:09,180
Drupal 7 blocks were not feel double

00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:11,970
caveat without beans or boxes or feel

00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:13,910
double panel pans or in a number of

00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:16,740
modules I may have forgotten but anyways

00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:20,700
basically there were solutions but they

00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:23,550
didn't come with in core and also it was

00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:25,500
kind of a divergent solution in Drupal 7

00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:27,210
ecosystem so it wasn't like everybody

00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:30,390
we've seen this is the same thing there

00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:35,340
was not like a consolidation of effort

00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:37,740
around that so sad so Drupal 8 blocks

00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:39,720
are feel dab'll we have custom block

00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:42,690
types which are similar to content types

00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:45,510
for nodes and we have different fields

00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:48,180
for type and we can have a custom block

00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:50,430
library that we can reuse so this is an

00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:53,460
example of different types we have a

00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:56,970
basic block which basically is just text

00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:59,490
in a title and text and then we have a

00:14:56,970 --> 00:15:02,280
map block which is basically just a

00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:04,590
simple map field on a block and a user

00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:06,750
promoter block which is just an entity

00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:08,820
reference to a user so they just use all

00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:12,660
standard fields any field that you could

00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:14,490
put on a node you can put on a block so

00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:16,290
this is our block library in that case

00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:19,680
where I have one block that's a map of

00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:23,390
New Jersey one is a user of the month

00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:26,580
block and then one is a map of Princeton

00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:29,649
so example here with the left top block

00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:31,930
is the user of the month block Einstein

00:15:29,649 --> 00:15:34,029
is you use a month and then down at the

00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:36,689
bottom we have a mat block that just has

00:15:34,029 --> 00:15:38,860
a UN or location and it renders a map so

00:15:36,689 --> 00:15:40,509
the fact that we're using standard

00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:42,610
fields basically means you kind of have

00:15:40,509 --> 00:15:44,769
unlimited block types in Drupal core

00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:48,399
depending on what you have installed for

00:15:44,769 --> 00:15:50,889
fields for contribs the other problem is

00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:56,319
blocks in Drupal 7 could only be placed

00:15:50,889 --> 00:15:59,079
once so if I made a view of all so sad

00:15:56,319 --> 00:16:00,699
so if I made a view and I wanted to put

00:15:59,079 --> 00:16:02,230
it in a block but show it sometimes on

00:16:00,699 --> 00:16:03,459
the right and sometimes on the Left I

00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:06,429
would actually have to make two versions

00:16:03,459 --> 00:16:09,550
of that view if I did not have panels or

00:16:06,429 --> 00:16:12,429
context installed in Drupal 8 you can

00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:14,740
have different configuration settings in

00:16:12,429 --> 00:16:16,689
each placement of the block and then

00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:19,899
also different visibility settings so an

00:16:16,689 --> 00:16:22,089
example would here is maybe on articles

00:16:19,899 --> 00:16:25,029
the user of the month shows up over on

00:16:22,089 --> 00:16:28,360
the right and the second side bar but in

00:16:25,029 --> 00:16:30,670
the pages maybe it shows up on the left

00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:34,410
so it's just placing the block twice and

00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:34,410
using different visibility settings

00:16:35,309 --> 00:16:40,990
another problem with Drupal 7 blocks is

00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:43,120
they not everything was a block so

00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:45,339
everything in green here in Drupal 7 and

00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:47,350
I actually had to install Drupal 7 to do

00:16:45,339 --> 00:16:49,179
this I hadn't done that in a while I

00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:51,819
actually do install it because i forgot

00:16:49,179 --> 00:16:55,209
what wasn't a block so just for this

00:16:51,819 --> 00:16:58,300
presentation so everything here is a

00:16:55,209 --> 00:17:01,179
block that's in green but all this stuff

00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:05,470
the tabs the branding the menu up on the

00:17:01,179 --> 00:17:09,750
right the page title itself wasn't

00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:12,189
actually a block whereas in Drupal 8

00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:13,959
everything is a block pretty much

00:17:12,189 --> 00:17:18,870
everything like the tool bar up top is

00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:18,870
not a block get a good picture

00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:25,209
I made one I made one mistake and making

00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:26,709
this slide there's a green line around

00:17:25,209 --> 00:17:30,190
the whole thing that's not true that's

00:17:26,709 --> 00:17:32,169
not a block but actually I missed one

00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:34,720
block there but this is a block this is

00:17:32,169 --> 00:17:36,549
a block the tabs are a block the site

00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:39,460
branding is a block that men use a block

00:17:36,549 --> 00:17:42,190
so all the benefits as far as like

00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:44,309
placing blocks maybe don't want the menu

00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:46,660
to show up on certain routes or whatever

00:17:44,309 --> 00:17:50,049
maybe you want the site branding block

00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:52,600
to show the logo and some some pages and

00:17:50,049 --> 00:17:55,270
not the logo in other places stuff you

00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:58,510
could eat so I think in in Drupal 7

00:17:55,270 --> 00:18:00,400
there was panels everywhere so that it

00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:03,309
could take over the whole page we kind

00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:08,020
of get a lot of the same benefit of that

00:18:03,309 --> 00:18:09,280
in Drupal core so basically the bartok

00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:10,929
out of the box is going to just make

00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:12,460
everything a block and if you kind of

00:18:10,929 --> 00:18:14,890
follow that pattern with other themes

00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:18,669
you can kind of make everything on your

00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:20,799
page easily configurable so we get to

00:18:18,669 --> 00:18:24,370
the admin screen so this is the admin

00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:26,950
screen for Drupal 7 so one of the

00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:29,380
problems I always had with the admin

00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:31,419
screen is if I have a particular block

00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:33,940
that I'm looking at and I have say 20

00:18:31,419 --> 00:18:36,190
blocks on the block screen if I look at

00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:37,330
any individual block I have no idea when

00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:38,909
it's going to show up because it's

00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:41,320
likely going to have visibility settings

00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:43,750
but I can't look at the page and just

00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:45,400
know you know where that particular

00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:47,230
block is going to show up for that one

00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:51,340
or that one or that one so it gets

00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:53,650
really confusing so part of part of the

00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:56,380
problem in Drupal 7 y panels and context

00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:58,179
was so great it's not only what you

00:18:56,380 --> 00:19:00,460
could do but like how you could manage

00:18:58,179 --> 00:19:03,460
it you could technically still do it a

00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:05,559
ton with just core blocks in Drupal 7 it

00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:07,720
just became really hard to manage after

00:19:05,559 --> 00:19:13,659
you had more than just a real small

00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:15,190
number of blocks so I think so you love

00:19:13,659 --> 00:19:19,230
the screen this is the great you know

00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:19,230
everybody use this drupal 7

00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:26,290
I didn't personally okay so that is sort

00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:29,890
of that screen made me feel I want to go

00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:31,180
to caveat that yeah there's an

00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:32,710
expression like the thing you hate

00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:37,060
somebody like put their heart and soul

00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:39,610
into so I'll get to why I think you know

00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:43,510
one of the biggest problems in droop and

00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:45,460
Drupal 7 and why this screen was a

00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:50,050
problem not necessarily because how it

00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:51,970
was made so Drupal 8 you do have a bit

00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:54,550
of differences you have this place block

00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:56,350
where you can easily just say you know I

00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:57,460
want to place a block in this region and

00:19:56,350 --> 00:20:00,160
this actually came from a usability

00:19:57,460 --> 00:20:03,580
study that they did where people didn't

00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:05,290
understand basically when you placed a

00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:07,210
block at the very bottom was the actual

00:20:05,290 --> 00:20:10,000
region you put it in and there wasn't a

00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:11,920
link / region to say I want to place it

00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:15,100
in this region so it was conceptually it

00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:16,420
was hard for beginners to remember where

00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:18,460
they were placing it and you had to go

00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:20,440
into the demo screen to see the regions

00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:23,590
and then come back and remember the

00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:25,150
names so now you can just place a block

00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:26,940
then you give a little search screen

00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:30,250
here you search for the block you want

00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:32,980
but the Drupal admin screen does have

00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:34,720
this problem of where do any of these

00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:37,750
individual blocks show up so that

00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:39,940
problem wasn't solved yet so if you look

00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:41,620
at all this and you're just like I don't

00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:43,000
I don't I have to click each one to

00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:45,280
configure like where does this oh this

00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,380
one shows up on pages only oh this one

00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:50,410
shows up on articles if the users logged

00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:52,840
in but as a management that is really

00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:56,740
kind of you know still that part kind of

00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:59,470
makes me go so we need a hero so caveat

00:20:56,740 --> 00:21:02,080
I wrote this module so this is block

00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:04,360
visibility groups and basically it

00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:07,750
sticks with the core blocks page but

00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:10,060
just makes it a little bit better let

00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:12,250
you manage blocks in groups so an

00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:13,990
example would be I want to manage all

00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:16,630
the blocks on articles together all

00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:18,940
blocks on pages maybe I want to manage

00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:21,150
all the homepage for anonymous users and

00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:25,240
then the homepage both indicated users

00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:26,980
so on the block spades it just adds some

00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:30,190
conditions up top and it says okay

00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:32,980
you're currently on the blocks page but

00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:34,150
we're only showing you blocks for what

00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:36,460
is the example here

00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:38,920
node bundles article and the user is a

00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:40,360
member of authenticated user so any

00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:42,160
block that you add in here will

00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:45,130
automatically only show up for them and

00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:47,380
then also you can only see those blocks

00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:50,050
so it makes a little bit easier so

00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:52,720
basically we're looking at the group

00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:54,430
article for its annotated user and then

00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:58,180
we see our conditions here we can add

00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:59,620
new conditions so instead of when does

00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:02,530
this block show up when does this blog

00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:04,450
show I know when all these blocks show

00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:06,120
up just by the fact that I set the

00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:08,700
conditions and then I place blocks

00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:11,980
individually based on those conditions

00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:17,050
and it also makes it easy to later on

00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:19,030
say I want to maybe it was for anonymous

00:22:17,050 --> 00:22:21,790
I made a group for anonymous users and

00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:24,250
then maybe actually I want to add a role

00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:26,290
new user so anonymous users and new

00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:28,240
users should see the same blocks I can

00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:30,160
easily go and just add the condition in

00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:34,390
one place and then it works for all the

00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:36,160
blocks in that group so these example

00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:38,890
visibility settings or articles for

00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:42,460
authenticated basic pages home page for

00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:45,790
anonymous homepage for logged in but

00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:51,400
what is Drupal 7 single biggest problem

00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:52,840
blocks any ideas so in my mind the

00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:55,630
biggest problem is they were made in

00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:58,630
2011 and they were frozen so basically

00:22:55,630 --> 00:23:03,100
you couldn't get new features into core

00:22:58,630 --> 00:23:05,260
block so came out in 2011 we knew there

00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:06,880
were some you know we knew we wanted to

00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:09,220
make it better so then you make it

00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:11,920
better in contribs space and everybody

00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:15,640
starts working on Drupal 8 we no longer

00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:17,560
have that problem so Drupal 8 we have

00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:19,660
semantic versioning dreese talked a

00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:21,700
little bit about the this today so

00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:23,770
basically means we can put new features

00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:27,940
as long as they don't break backwards

00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:30,160
compatibility in 82 83 84 85 we have

00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:32,680
experimental modules which means we can

00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:34,720
get those modules in and they don't have

00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:38,170
to be perfect and we can iterate over

00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:40,660
them a lot faster and also we have

00:23:38,170 --> 00:23:44,740
regular releases so 82 is going to come

00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:47,170
out next week 81 came out I think six

00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:47,770
months ago but we have regular six-month

00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:50,980
really

00:23:47,770 --> 00:23:53,590
so we can add the experimental modules

00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:59,980
in and then we can I think it's like a

00:23:53,590 --> 00:24:02,200
year to get them to stable so Drupal 8

00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:05,880
point X so the best may actually get to

00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:10,120
become for the block system in core

00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:12,010
Drupal 8.2 was very good for blocks or

00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:13,870
will be very good for blocks I guess

00:24:12,010 --> 00:24:17,580
it's out there for you to test right now

00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:19,960
but it hopefully gets released next week

00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:24,370
so warning what I'm going to show you is

00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:26,950
experimental modules and Drupal 8.2 okay

00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:29,110
their experimental in that we don't

00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:31,990
guarantee backwards compatibility so

00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:35,290
that's in the Drupal community between

00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:37,810
releases between 8.1 and 8.2 you can't

00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:39,220
break backwards compatibility except if

00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:41,140
they're experimental because you get a

00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:43,210
warning hey this experimental module

00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:46,840
this may not act the same way it may not

00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:49,630
work perfect but I think definitely they

00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:52,030
are ready to test and that's we you know

00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:54,660
we need feedback to see how does this

00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:58,540
work does is this what you would expect

00:24:54,660 --> 00:25:01,690
how can we do a better so let's look at

00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:10,660
and Drupal 8.1 and 80 the current way to

00:25:01,690 --> 00:25:14,620
place a block so i go to structure block

00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:17,500
layout and then I go and I pick a region

00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:18,760
I hit actually first I'm going to demo

00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:21,220
the regions because I don't know what

00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:22,750
they are because I knew I want to put in

00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:24,550
the second side bar i'm going to go back

00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:25,660
and actually i just had to hit the back

00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:29,530
button because i couldn't figure out how

00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:32,080
to get back and i'm going to pick my

00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:34,210
region i'm going to place it in there I

00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:37,000
get to search for my blocks which is

00:25:34,210 --> 00:25:40,330
great powered by drupal right i'm going

00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:42,730
to save it no conditions and I'm napped

00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:46,600
go back to the site and I look at it's

00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:48,940
like oh it's there cool so not super

00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:50,890
hard but also not super intuitive if

00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:52,360
you're new to Drupal if you've been

00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:54,990
using Drupal for a while it's probably

00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:58,270
like no big deal I know how to do this

00:25:54,990 --> 00:26:00,960
so let's look at the way with the place

00:25:58,270 --> 00:26:09,549
block module

00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:11,289
go back into my so this lets you place

00:26:09,549 --> 00:26:13,809
blocks from any page you don't need to

00:26:11,289 --> 00:26:15,490
go back to the admin pages it's great

00:26:13,809 --> 00:26:17,470
for beginners and I think it's also like

00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:19,840
a click saver for any of us who've been

00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:22,059
around for a while too so let's look at

00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:23,980
how you place blocks and 8.2 with the

00:26:22,059 --> 00:26:25,450
experimental module and hopefully 83 or

00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:34,090
84 this will just be like the way you

00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:35,350
place box my mouse okay we're going to

00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:37,679
have to go out of the screen for a

00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:37,679
second

00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:48,320
okay so we go up to the top to place

00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:53,150
blocks all of our region's now have

00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:54,860
these little plus mark plus sign so we

00:26:53,150 --> 00:26:56,210
can just say add the block here you

00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:58,700
don't need to understand this is the

00:26:56,210 --> 00:27:03,080
second sidebar you just need to say this

00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:05,140
is where I want the block again you

00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:07,970
search like before search for the block

00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:10,940
he placed the block no conditions i'll

00:27:07,970 --> 00:27:13,670
just save it and boom it just shows up

00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:15,170
so I never had to leave really besides

00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:17,990
the modal and we can get rid of the

00:27:15,170 --> 00:27:19,490
modal soon I never had to leave the

00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:26,810
front page of my sight and I see the

00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:33,190
change right away so another

00:27:26,810 --> 00:27:36,320
experimental module is okay is the

00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:38,150
settings tray so if you've read any blog

00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:39,830
posts of Teresa's recently he may have

00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:42,710
referred to it as the outside end module

00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:43,850
I'm sorry I named it that it wasn't you

00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:45,230
know it's probably not a very good name

00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:48,380
for it so now it's called the settings

00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:53,570
tray module to get again experimental

00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:56,140
module coming in 8.2 and there should be

00:27:53,570 --> 00:27:59,210
a youtube video there oh no there's not

00:27:56,140 --> 00:28:00,830
so enhances the edit mode that you get

00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:05,150
with quick edit or kind of piggy backs

00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:09,710
off that and it quickly lets you edit

00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:13,810
existing blocks on the page and and it

00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:13,810
lets you edit the related configuration

00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:19,340
basically we're trying to give you easy

00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:23,330
access to the stuff you actually want to

00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:27,890
change so imagine that you are a

00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:33,200
beginner or image you're a beginner and

00:28:27,890 --> 00:28:36,740
you just install Drupal I actually fixed

00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:39,350
it up top but forgot to fix it okay you

00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:42,740
go to the homepage and you want to

00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:45,650
change the site name so let's look at

00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:49,310
this so I click configure block I go

00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:52,790
back to the back and can i change the

00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:54,540
site name back there no I cannot change

00:28:52,790 --> 00:29:00,120
the site name so some reason

00:28:54,540 --> 00:29:03,540
go in and out of presentation mode so as

00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:05,310
a new user I might be thinking where is

00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:06,660
the site name i clicked on the thing

00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:08,430
that had the site name i wanted to

00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:11,010
change it but it took me back to block

00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:12,990
configuration now as an experienced

00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:14,730
Drupal or you may go yeah because it's a

00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:17,010
different thing but we're sort of

00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:18,630
thinking of as your new you don't know

00:29:17,010 --> 00:29:20,580
that there's a block placement thing

00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:22,380
that's different the site name you just

00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:24,240
know that you clicked near the site name

00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:27,030
because you wanted to change the site

00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:31,260
name okay so let's look at how you could

00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:37,530
do it with settings tray you click on

00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:39,270
the title update the title okay so i go

00:29:37,530 --> 00:29:41,880
here and i click here and i do a quick

00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:49,260
at it and it comes over on the right oh

00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:52,920
this is a menu one wrong video same idea

00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:56,130
though i'm clicking on a menu and i want

00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:59,670
to change the menu I may have reordered

00:29:56,130 --> 00:30:01,500
my reordered my ones yeah and so

00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:04,050
basically here i want it i want to

00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:05,940
enable new menu items maybe i want to

00:30:04,050 --> 00:30:11,460
change the title this actually gives you

00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:14,360
an example of gives you an example of

00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:18,420
half wanting to do two things i want to

00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:20,490
change the the label for a particular

00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:22,770
block and i want to change something

00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:24,510
about the menu now on the back end those

00:30:22,770 --> 00:30:25,980
are two separate things the placement of

00:30:24,510 --> 00:30:28,770
the block in the configuration of the

00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:35,130
menu but conceptually you know that's

00:30:28,770 --> 00:30:36,570
maybe one thing to a new user so let's

00:30:35,130 --> 00:30:38,700
actually look at something this it also

00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:41,910
could possibly be the experience for

00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:45,950
adding blocks and 8.3 or 8.4 actually

00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:48,570
adding or editing multiple blocks so i

00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:50,580
say i have the article content type and

00:30:48,570 --> 00:30:56,130
i want to place the fields of the blocks

00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:58,650
in different places so i'm going to

00:30:56,130 --> 00:31:01,800
click over here i'm going to look for

00:30:58,650 --> 00:31:04,740
the author of the node authored by place

00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:08,460
i'm given here because this is actually

00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:11,790
see tools adds blocks per field

00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:14,790
to say I want to show the author as a

00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:18,380
formatter of an entity and I want to

00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:22,740
show the article view of the entity and

00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:25,230
this slider here is so this is this is

00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:26,910
basically the settings tray being used

00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:28,530
with block place so this is the idea

00:31:26,910 --> 00:31:31,080
that we could start to use the setting

00:31:28,530 --> 00:31:33,090
trays for a lot more stuff but you see

00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:34,050
we haven't actually done that I just

00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:38,490
have a site that I've converted

00:31:34,050 --> 00:31:40,650
everything to the settings tray so we

00:31:38,490 --> 00:31:43,110
saved this it automatically shows up

00:31:40,650 --> 00:31:45,180
over here now I want to place a block I

00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:47,070
want to place the image for the article

00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:50,460
over on the right I'm going to click

00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:58,170
here search for the image field click it

00:31:50,460 --> 00:32:03,840
choose the formatter for the image solve

00:31:58,170 --> 00:32:05,970
the scroll problem I didn't want to edit

00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:09,090
out the nastiness from you guys I

00:32:05,970 --> 00:32:10,740
figured you can handle it and then

00:32:09,090 --> 00:32:13,470
finally I'm going to go and I'm going to

00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:15,300
add the tags down at the bottom so you

00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:17,610
can see here where you get to have a

00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:19,290
very sort of panels like experience of

00:32:17,610 --> 00:32:22,470
just grabbing fields and putting them in

00:32:19,290 --> 00:32:25,410
different places this is only with the

00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:27,810
only thing you actually this would just

00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:30,600
take the two new experimental modules in

00:32:27,810 --> 00:32:32,580
Drupal 8.2 and then see tools they

00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:34,410
wouldn't open up in the tray blase place

00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:38,310
block would open up in the in the top

00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:39,990
but you start to get that experience and

00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:45,120
then I'm going to skip putting the the

00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:47,490
tags in jumped here and then if I didn't

00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:49,650
make all the settings correctly I could

00:32:47,490 --> 00:32:51,090
actually go in and say I wanted to

00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:53,400
change this image to use a different

00:32:51,090 --> 00:32:54,570
style I could just do a quick edit opens

00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:58,200
up on the right I want to use the

00:32:54,570 --> 00:33:01,260
thumbnail and I save it so all of this

00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:06,960
without actually you know going back to

00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:09,570
the admin screen so so this is basically

00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:12,900
place block setting stray and see tools

00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:15,270
but easily like I said the worst thing

00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:18,540
about Drupal 7 blocks is they were

00:33:15,270 --> 00:33:20,550
frozen in 2011 but now you know we've

00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:22,650
already added two new kind of cool

00:33:20,550 --> 00:33:25,140
additions to the block actually not in

00:33:22,650 --> 00:33:27,600
the block module but to deal with blocks

00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:29,400
and we could start to add more if people

00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:31,590
think actually a field for every block

00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:33,660
is great then we could add that if we

00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:38,640
want to but basically the idea is we can

00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:40,500
add new cool stuff as we go along so

00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:42,230
other related blocks I'm actually going

00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:45,120
to go through this part kind of quick

00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:47,220
field is block which actually probably i

00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:48,750
would recommend CTools instead of this

00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:53,850
module at this point but it basically

00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:56,250
adds a block for each field let's go

00:33:53,850 --> 00:33:57,750
through that quickly but the other thing

00:33:56,250 --> 00:34:00,450
that's really great about this though

00:33:57,750 --> 00:34:04,050
that see tools and this module both

00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:07,230
benefit from is ever so many more things

00:34:04,050 --> 00:34:09,990
are fields in Drupal 8 than they were in

00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:13,140
Drupal 7 so publish status authored by

00:34:09,990 --> 00:34:15,480
title all of that is fields in Drupal 8

00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:18,270
where they weren't necessarily in Drupal

00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:19,890
7 so modules had to do special logic say

00:34:18,270 --> 00:34:23,960
if they wanted to expose all those

00:34:19,890 --> 00:34:25,920
things as like a field block in Drupal 8

00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:28,050
basically all they have to do is I want

00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:30,060
to expose all fields as blocks you get

00:34:28,050 --> 00:34:34,860
so much more than the same module would

00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:36,960
have got in Drupal 7 CTools adds extra

00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:39,810
reviews and blocks configuration or

00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:42,630
configuration in views blocks it gets

00:34:39,810 --> 00:34:45,930
you closer to views content pains that

00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:47,430
people have used that in panels actually

00:34:45,930 --> 00:34:50,730
was part of see tools but usually was

00:34:47,430 --> 00:34:52,770
use with panels it gets you closer to

00:34:50,730 --> 00:34:54,840
that just with regular views blocks in

00:34:52,770 --> 00:34:56,640
Drupal 8 again it gives you the one

00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:58,410
field for block it gives you block UI

00:34:56,640 --> 00:35:00,840
improvements and it gives you the extra

00:34:58,410 --> 00:35:02,610
conditions so if you're trying to stick

00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:05,700
with core blocks and you're like I don't

00:35:02,610 --> 00:35:07,950
want to deal with panels yet or other

00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:09,630
block related modules i would recommend

00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:14,550
installing see tools and see what

00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:19,230
improvements it has so let's just get

00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:19,710
through those so to the modules that I'm

00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:22,859
saying you

00:35:19,710 --> 00:35:25,710
might not need panels is still great I

00:35:22,859 --> 00:35:27,540
you know I probably would use panels

00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:30,530
eventually if I was making Drupal 8 site

00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:34,589
soon it's a beta for right now it's over

00:35:30,530 --> 00:35:36,240
3,000 rupal eight sites and but it might

00:35:34,589 --> 00:35:38,160
not be needed for a lot of sites where

00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:40,619
you did need it in Drupal 7 so I'm not

00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:42,480
saying don't use panels it's just for me

00:35:40,619 --> 00:35:44,810
if I was making it i would consider site

00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:46,859
by site whether i would actually need it

00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:49,560
context i think is a work in progress

00:35:46,859 --> 00:35:51,089
and or stalled last time i checked all

00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:52,349
the slides will be out there but if

00:35:51,089 --> 00:35:53,670
anybody's interested they could go to

00:35:52,349 --> 00:35:57,060
this node and see what the latest

00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:59,849
progress is there was work on github but

00:35:57,060 --> 00:36:06,810
I checked this week and I don't I didn't

00:35:59,849 --> 00:36:09,270
see any any progress so conclusion core

00:36:06,810 --> 00:36:11,250
blocks are better and drupal 8 just out

00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:14,910
of the box as soon as you install Drupal

00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:17,400
you get a lot more benefits core blocks

00:36:14,910 --> 00:36:19,230
plesk and trib you know really become

00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:23,570
something like bordering on awesome I

00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:25,830
would think but also obviously more

00:36:23,570 --> 00:36:28,530
contributes I think one of the things

00:36:25,830 --> 00:36:31,140
that really makes this different than a

00:36:28,530 --> 00:36:33,450
Drupal 7 is the fact that we have so

00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:35,730
many underlying systems that we thought

00:36:33,450 --> 00:36:37,290
about in the Drupal 8 development

00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:41,880
process and one a good example is

00:36:37,290 --> 00:36:44,430
conditions is panels rules and context

00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:46,650
all had these conditions something

00:36:44,430 --> 00:36:49,109
should happen in a certain condition but

00:36:46,650 --> 00:36:51,240
they all were separate systems so if

00:36:49,109 --> 00:36:54,390
somebody made a condition plug-in for

00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:56,580
context nobody in rules or panels or the

00:36:54,390 --> 00:37:00,030
block system got the benefit of that now

00:36:56,580 --> 00:37:03,660
because we have unified that if you make

00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:06,780
a contribs new condition core blocks

00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:09,109
gets it rules gets it panels gets it so

00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:12,660
you can use it in so many more places

00:37:09,109 --> 00:37:15,060
also the thing that I think is a great

00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:17,550
about Drupal 8 box is we can add more

00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:20,400
stuff and we can experiment a lot faster

00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:22,830
so that the block system that I've shown

00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:26,490
you now for Drupal 8 and why i think is

00:37:22,830 --> 00:37:29,099
awesome there may be you know reasons i

00:37:26,490 --> 00:37:31,380
can't even think of that now that might

00:37:29,099 --> 00:37:33,420
make core Drupal 8 blocks so much better

00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:43,079
in a year or something

00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:48,990
that all right so questions it did

00:37:43,079 --> 00:37:51,809
thanks so if I if I go and I enabled

00:37:48,990 --> 00:37:54,089
these experimental modules place my

00:37:51,809 --> 00:37:55,500
blocks do a bunch of work and then for

00:37:54,089 --> 00:37:57,299
whatever reason I have to yank out these

00:37:55,500 --> 00:38:01,740
experimented jewels to my settings stick

00:37:57,299 --> 00:38:02,819
yes so I ok I'm glad somebody else

00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:06,540
brought this up because I did not want

00:38:02,819 --> 00:38:10,010
to bring this up I personally think that

00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:12,599
the two modules that made it into 8.2

00:38:10,010 --> 00:38:14,790
they're usable but you know their

00:38:12,599 --> 00:38:17,190
experimental for sure but if you're

00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:19,650
using them locally on a local

00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:22,650
environment not on production but you do

00:38:19,650 --> 00:38:24,839
local development they do not save

00:38:22,650 --> 00:38:27,240
unless and again the experimental unless

00:38:24,839 --> 00:38:29,579
we really mess up they're not saving how

00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:33,119
blocks are saved so you can just turn

00:38:29,579 --> 00:38:35,609
them off and on production the settings

00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:38,869
should stick caveat there experimental

00:38:35,609 --> 00:38:44,190
but I think yeah you could do that

00:38:38,869 --> 00:38:46,770
caveat experimental you know because we

00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:49,589
may change these modules I'm only

00:38:46,770 --> 00:38:51,480
actually involved in outside in I'm not

00:38:49,589 --> 00:38:55,250
setting stray up I wasn't really

00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:59,190
involved in place block but you know

00:38:55,250 --> 00:39:00,960
those could be changed and it would

00:38:59,190 --> 00:39:02,400
break so what it would really break is

00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:04,730
it would break any module that tried to

00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:07,799
integrate with them like do not well if

00:39:04,730 --> 00:39:09,569
you expect to write a module that

00:39:07,799 --> 00:39:11,069
integrates with place block or settings

00:39:09,569 --> 00:39:12,630
tray right now realize that you will

00:39:11,069 --> 00:39:16,230
have to update your stuff as we break

00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:18,030
them but potentially you could use them

00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:20,119
to place blocks and then turn them off

00:39:18,030 --> 00:39:28,240
and you'd be fine caveat experimental

00:39:20,119 --> 00:39:36,930
yeah so yeah any other questions yep

00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:39,970
yeah yeah yeah so that is definitely

00:39:36,930 --> 00:39:42,640
something that would be awesome and I

00:39:39,970 --> 00:39:45,430
think should be so you get into a lot of

00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:47,260
problems of like you would want to like

00:39:45,430 --> 00:39:50,950
do the change the menu and see it

00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:52,450
happening over here yeah that we should

00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:55,030
figure out a way to do that that

00:39:52,450 --> 00:39:57,100
basically is the direction that we want

00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:58,840
to go in there's a lot of technical

00:39:57,100 --> 00:40:01,660
problems to that because you would have

00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:03,880
to basically you know go to the server

00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:05,230
render it rerender the way it is now

00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:08,020
you'd have to go to the server render it

00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:11,950
replace that part I think one thing that

00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:14,050
could potentially yeah I guess also like

00:40:11,950 --> 00:40:16,630
not just questions I wanted questions

00:40:14,050 --> 00:40:18,340
and ideas since you know drupal 8 is

00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:20,110
evolving if people have other ideas they

00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:22,330
want to talk about for improvements we

00:40:20,110 --> 00:40:23,860
can make the core blocks but one thing

00:40:22,330 --> 00:40:25,450
that are long your lines that could make

00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:27,670
the experience a little bit better is

00:40:25,450 --> 00:40:30,160
the refreshness module how many people

00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:32,320
have seen that I think he demoed it but

00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:34,120
the idea is you click the page instead

00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:36,910
of it reloading it only reloads the

00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:38,950
parts that it want so if refresh lyst

00:40:36,910 --> 00:40:40,920
got into core where if somebody actually

00:40:38,950 --> 00:40:45,000
somebody could actually write this as a

00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:48,310
contributor a you could actually save

00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:50,470
have the settings trace save it and you

00:40:48,310 --> 00:40:52,870
can use refresh list to only update what

00:40:50,470 --> 00:40:54,850
needed to be updated and it's that the

00:40:52,870 --> 00:40:57,220
tricky part is if I have a menu block

00:40:54,850 --> 00:40:59,320
over here and I open it up and I change

00:40:57,220 --> 00:41:00,940
the menu settings and I save it there's

00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:03,010
no guarantee that's the only place on

00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:06,130
the site on the current page we're using

00:41:03,010 --> 00:41:08,890
the menu but refresh list gets by that

00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:10,960
by saying basically goes to the servant

00:41:08,890 --> 00:41:13,420
says with our new cash tax system says

00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:15,220
tell me the regions that need to be

00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:17,890
updated because of cash tagged in

00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:22,060
validation and it just magically figures

00:41:17,890 --> 00:41:23,680
it out and it will send you back only

00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:26,380
the regions that need to be updated and

00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:29,140
they'll be updated in place so if that

00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:30,580
was in core we could really make a great

00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:31,990
experience with saving the blocks and

00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:33,970
just automatically looks like it updates

00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:35,590
everywhere it would update everywhere so

00:41:33,970 --> 00:41:37,480
that that would be awesome the

00:41:35,590 --> 00:41:39,940
refreshness module is like something

00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:41,740
that's I think on the line to get into

00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:43,360
core but

00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:45,520
you know that's not to say somebody

00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:47,230
couldn't actually experiment it with it

00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:52,270
in contrib you can basically do what I'm

00:41:47,230 --> 00:41:53,740
talking about and contribute I'm and you

00:41:52,270 --> 00:41:56,260
could check with me I could show you how

00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:59,260
to do it any other questions ideas

00:41:56,260 --> 00:42:03,430
problems with that we can improved your

00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:09,010
blade blocks that's that's perfect like

00:42:03,430 --> 00:42:10,480
you no other feature requests I have a

00:42:09,010 --> 00:42:17,110
lot of time to work on Drupal 8 blocks

00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:20,740
if anybody has other ideas well

00:42:17,110 --> 00:42:24,910
especially in Drupal 7 yeah bean allows

00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:28,480
you to give content managers the ability

00:42:24,910 --> 00:42:30,960
to manage their blocks more easily aha

00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:35,730
without their giving them a global

00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:38,380
access to block management yeah so

00:42:35,730 --> 00:42:40,480
that's that's a problem we're confronted

00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:42,580
with regularly on Drupal 7 usually yeah

00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:45,460
if they want to be able to manage a

00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:46,720
single block we have to tell them not to

00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:53,859
touch any of the other blood so

00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:56,950
potentially so potentially you could do

00:42:53,859 --> 00:42:58,600
that now if you had a module like I

00:42:56,950 --> 00:43:01,210
don't know what the content like the

00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:05,640
access modules are in control and Drupal

00:43:01,210 --> 00:43:05,640
8 but potentially you could get a

00:43:05,850 --> 00:43:11,590
contributor access for different entity

00:43:08,950 --> 00:43:12,730
types and you could show them a list of

00:43:11,590 --> 00:43:15,130
their blocks and they could actually

00:43:12,730 --> 00:43:18,780
change so anything you could do safer

00:43:15,130 --> 00:43:21,490
nodes since nodes that's not true but

00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:24,790
potentially there might be a contributor

00:43:21,490 --> 00:43:26,740
lets you do fine grain access control on

00:43:24,790 --> 00:43:29,680
entities you could use that because

00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:31,090
custom blocks now are just entities but

00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:33,850
that would only work for custom blocks

00:43:31,090 --> 00:43:35,350
not like the branding block or a menu

00:43:33,850 --> 00:43:37,560
block and stuff like that but if you

00:43:35,350 --> 00:43:42,910
were dealing strictly with custom blocks

00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:44,560
as a generic entity access module might

00:43:42,910 --> 00:43:47,080
be able to handle that with that

00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:49,990
integrate with the the setting story we

00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:54,820
effects the ability to I think right now

00:43:49,990 --> 00:43:56,590
we are actually checking i def

00:43:54,820 --> 00:43:59,710
check we may be actually checking for

00:43:56,590 --> 00:44:02,800
blocks administration so one idea would

00:43:59,710 --> 00:44:04,210
be maybe the permission for outs for the

00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:06,160
settings train a block should not be

00:44:04,210 --> 00:44:09,000
blocks administration it could be the

00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:11,470
access to update that particular entity

00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:14,260
we haven't thought about it that way but

00:44:11,470 --> 00:44:27,610
that yeah but usually it would be the

00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:32,580
same unless you had a contributor

00:44:27,610 --> 00:44:32,580
thoughts questions how this works yeah

00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:37,680
yeah

00:44:51,380 --> 00:45:04,049
yeah yeah they're looking for already on

00:44:57,180 --> 00:45:05,910
that page oh yeah sorry I'm supposed to

00:45:04,049 --> 00:45:12,660
be repeating the questions or good of

00:45:05,910 --> 00:45:15,569
the mic yeah so the question is about

00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:17,609
the blocks layout page because I think

00:45:15,569 --> 00:45:19,829
it's much improved especially for those

00:45:17,609 --> 00:45:21,569
of us who who know Drupal but for people

00:45:19,829 --> 00:45:23,430
who are our new sometimes they come

00:45:21,569 --> 00:45:27,089
people come to that page and are

00:45:23,430 --> 00:45:28,759
confused when they don't see things that

00:45:27,089 --> 00:45:31,650
are obvious that they expect to be there

00:45:28,759 --> 00:45:33,720
like new blocks especially when you're

00:45:31,650 --> 00:45:36,450
enabling a new module let's say the

00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:37,799
locale the multilingual modules don't

00:45:36,450 --> 00:45:39,930
enable them and then you don't see the

00:45:37,799 --> 00:45:43,079
language switcher be nice to have like a

00:45:39,930 --> 00:45:44,759
prompt so so sort of back story and why

00:45:43,079 --> 00:45:46,920
this has changed between Drupal 7 and

00:45:44,759 --> 00:45:48,480
Drupal 8 so the whole idea Drupal 8

00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:51,480
where you can place a single block

00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:53,190
multiple times kind of relieves the need

00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:54,690
for that part at the bottom of a Drupal

00:45:53,190 --> 00:45:56,700
7 module you say these are all your

00:45:54,690 --> 00:45:58,410
disabled blocks because really those

00:45:56,700 --> 00:46:01,619
were one off things you didn't have them

00:45:58,410 --> 00:46:03,539
twice whereas in Drupal 8 a single block

00:46:01,619 --> 00:46:05,160
we place multiple times so it doesn't

00:46:03,539 --> 00:46:10,559
make this sense to say this one

00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:12,269
particular one is disabled but yeah when

00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:16,440
once you hit the place block whether

00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:18,180
it's in the the new stuff or the

00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:19,559
existing one you get a list but like you

00:46:18,180 --> 00:46:21,299
said you don't know that that list is

00:46:19,559 --> 00:46:24,660
there right unless you click it yeah

00:46:21,299 --> 00:46:25,950
ideas Kevin so yes the the sort of the

00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:29,999
North Star designs that we're working

00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:32,309
towards with with these modules is that

00:46:29,999 --> 00:46:35,279
you'll be able to place blocks from the

00:46:32,309 --> 00:46:36,660
settings tray as well so that we want

00:46:35,279 --> 00:46:38,730
the user to not have to go to that

00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:40,680
especially the new user the person who

00:46:38,730 --> 00:46:43,890
is unfamiliar with Drupal to be able to

00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:46,920
click a link to place blocks link and

00:46:43,890 --> 00:46:50,670
then to have the blocks show up and then

00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:52,109
also do things like automatically filter

00:46:50,670 --> 00:46:54,089
the list of blocks two blocks that have

00:46:52,109 --> 00:46:56,240
either been recently updated or updated

00:46:54,089 --> 00:46:58,370
by that particular user

00:46:56,240 --> 00:47:00,860
so that you know so that those things

00:46:58,370 --> 00:47:03,080
are coming to the surface and that

00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:04,700
people get like you say that the people

00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:06,800
have an expectation that they want to

00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:08,570
get the block that they that was just

00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:11,240
added or that was just updated or that

00:47:08,570 --> 00:47:13,490
they worked on themselves and and

00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:14,930
immediately add that thing and also be

00:47:13,490 --> 00:47:17,270
able to see it be able to see a preview

00:47:14,930 --> 00:47:18,590
of it and then and then and then add it

00:47:17,270 --> 00:47:20,390
and that's those are sort of

00:47:18,590 --> 00:47:22,640
enhancements that were that we're not

00:47:20,390 --> 00:47:25,010
seeing yet but like Ted said we have

00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:26,750
lots of things that we can add because

00:47:25,010 --> 00:47:29,150
we have semantic versioning and we have

00:47:26,750 --> 00:47:31,310
experimental modules so look for more of

00:47:29,150 --> 00:47:34,300
those things to be coming soon and then

00:47:31,310 --> 00:47:38,780
also I was going to mention things like

00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:40,910
so Ted showed the the way that you can

00:47:38,780 --> 00:47:42,650
create these visibility groups for

00:47:40,910 --> 00:47:44,450
blocks we'd like to see visibility

00:47:42,650 --> 00:47:46,880
groups for blocks on the front end as

00:47:44,450 --> 00:47:50,740
well so I could say for example you know

00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:54,950
show me this page under this particular

00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:58,940
context of a user or of a you know a you

00:47:54,950 --> 00:48:01,550
know of something in the URL etc so one

00:47:58,940 --> 00:48:04,250
other thing about that idea is one

00:48:01,550 --> 00:48:06,980
benefit again of other changes in Drupal

00:48:04,250 --> 00:48:09,260
8 that are sort of making things easier

00:48:06,980 --> 00:48:11,330
to do in Drupal easier than they were in

00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:13,430
Drupal 7 is since blocks are

00:48:11,330 --> 00:48:16,430
configuration entities you could

00:48:13,430 --> 00:48:18,860
potentially make a view now yourself and

00:48:16,430 --> 00:48:20,300
make a link in that view to place the

00:48:18,860 --> 00:48:22,580
block so you can make a view of blocks

00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:28,280
and say I want to place this block so

00:48:22,580 --> 00:48:30,830
without too much work a contribute a

00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:32,930
length saz available blocks opens up in

00:48:30,830 --> 00:48:34,370
the settings tray and says here you're

00:48:32,930 --> 00:48:38,360
available blocks and each one would have

00:48:34,370 --> 00:48:39,890
a place block link so or you could just

00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:41,450
have it to where they have a separate

00:48:39,890 --> 00:48:43,220
page they would go to that they know

00:48:41,450 --> 00:48:45,830
that these are all the blocks and it

00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:47,830
would take you to place them so the fact

00:48:45,830 --> 00:48:51,410
that their conviction fig entities and

00:48:47,830 --> 00:48:54,410
no that's not right sorry they won't

00:48:51,410 --> 00:48:56,300
work the fuse sorry take that back I

00:48:54,410 --> 00:49:01,190
don't think anybody else you can't list

00:48:56,300 --> 00:49:03,860
configure these in Doozer yeah you can't

00:49:01,190 --> 00:49:05,600
do that now nevermind you can do it you

00:49:03,860 --> 00:49:07,460
can you could do it in code really

00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:09,140
easily but you can't do it with use so

00:49:07,460 --> 00:49:09,950
you actually contribute could really

00:49:09,140 --> 00:49:12,410
easily say

00:49:09,950 --> 00:49:15,500
Liss blocks at under certain condition

00:49:12,410 --> 00:49:17,780
and you know give the user a page to

00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:19,490
list those or maybe open them up on the

00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:22,369
side if the user is logged in or

00:49:19,490 --> 00:49:30,400
something like that but ya can't do it

00:49:22,369 --> 00:49:33,560
view sorry sorry about that yeah yeah

00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:37,010
yeah I think the the hope of the place

00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:38,420
block module is that you new users

00:49:37,010 --> 00:49:41,960
wouldn't have to go to the block layout

00:49:38,420 --> 00:49:44,390
page as much so they would just see the

00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:47,030
link to place a block and at that point

00:49:44,390 --> 00:49:48,980
there immediately given the list so

00:49:47,030 --> 00:49:53,690
they're not on the block page looking

00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:55,220
for a list they're just all right I

00:49:53,690 --> 00:49:56,660
guess your place your block pick your

00:49:55,220 --> 00:49:58,990
region and immediately you're given a

00:49:56,660 --> 00:50:01,310
list immediately after one step but

00:49:58,990 --> 00:50:03,079
region or the blocks you want are

00:50:01,310 --> 00:50:06,140
obviously the most important things and

00:50:03,079 --> 00:50:08,900
that not process any other question not

00:50:06,140 --> 00:50:14,800
ideas for what could be better in core

00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:14,800
blocks yes

00:50:15,660 --> 00:50:26,499
yeah okay yeah so the question was we

00:50:24,220 --> 00:50:28,240
looked at the field as black thing can

00:50:26,499 --> 00:50:32,380
you get the entity reference yeah so

00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:34,269
anything that is on so caveat you can

00:50:32,380 --> 00:50:36,130
put something on like an article page

00:50:34,269 --> 00:50:37,599
that's a field for something else and it

00:50:36,130 --> 00:50:40,869
won't show up but if you manage it

00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:43,269
correctly yeah you can say this node has

00:50:40,869 --> 00:50:46,920
an ND reference to another node or to a

00:50:43,269 --> 00:50:46,920
