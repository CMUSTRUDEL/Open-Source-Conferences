Title: DrupalCon Dublin 2016: Who cares about Drupal? How to win the hearts and minds of businesses
Publication date: 2016-09-27
Playlist: DrupalCon Dublin 2016
Description: 
	If you're in the Drupal business you can have a thriving practise, for clients that are already on Drupal or are considering adopting it. The demand for Drupal is good news for us. For now. For most clients we may fix needs for a CMS and other functional solutions. But many clients have deeper, underlaying challenges that may tear at the fabric of that solid Drupal pipeline. While you may have a Drupal sponsor within your client's organisation, the business side within that organisation is steadily maturing and will be demanding help with bootstrapping their organisation towards online revenue and measurable return on investment. They will be asking you about digitally transforming their online precense and work in line with their online strategy. If not, you may start building up a network around you with wich to combine forces to help clients in their next step, beyond the requirements and choice for some specific CMS.

In this session I will share insights and experience of client-service optimization and how to win the hearts-and-minds of organisations that are progressing in their digital maturity and requiring Service Design. Delivering a CMS is only half of the requirements for succes. How drag-n-drop made sense for the Chief Marketing Officer (CMO) of enterprise scale companies. How does online strategy and customer experience increase your chances on winning med to large size Drupal webprojects.

Topics:

Service Design: How to connect with CMO's, CIO's and decision makers beyond a list of requirements
Helping (potential) clients overcome their fears 
Defintion of Succes 
Qualifying your clients based on their digital maturity and applying the right strategy to win and succeed in digital projects
The Boyscout Rule: working together as a team
Target audience: Business owners, sales reps, technical architects of Drupal delivering agencies that want to know what it takes to sell larger Drupal projects.

The goal is to inspire to focus beyond delivering Drupal platforms based on requirements alone so that agencies may broaden their service portfolio to help more businesses and organisations.

so welcome everyone to my session who

00:00:04,529 --> 00:00:11,400
cares about drupal how to win the hearts

00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:13,410
and minds of businesses I'm excited to

00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:16,830
be here actually my name is Enrico made

00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:20,850
of mailing my name is totally not Dutch

00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:24,420
but I am I'm it's a it's a privilege

00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:26,449
actually to be here I did session at

00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:31,320
drupalcon Helsinki a couple of weeks ago

00:00:26,449 --> 00:00:34,620
and tried it out there I want to share

00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:36,750
with you today some of the insights that

00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:40,649
I've been gathering over the past few

00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:42,960
years when i came across several smaller

00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:47,399
and several larger companies that were

00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:52,129
adopting grupal for reasons that might

00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:55,379
not seem obvious to many of us right so

00:00:52,129 --> 00:00:57,719
for me I started UX development quite

00:00:55,379 --> 00:01:02,340
some time ago rolled into Drupal at

00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:04,769
version 4 did some development but I've

00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:06,600
been talking about it ever since last 10

00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:11,280
years so if not being into development

00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:13,520
but I do have the background and lay the

00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,470
link between the the technical folk and

00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:19,619
the project as well as the client's

00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:22,320
needs and demands and I've had some to

00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:25,020
me astounding insights of what clients

00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:27,500
have been looking for recently and and

00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:30,329
to my mind are looking for more and more

00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:31,860
so I've been with glimpse on before

00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:34,350
which is now Buddha crowd as you may

00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:38,100
know currently I'm with lime green

00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:40,380
include sustainable websites sustainable

00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:42,750
for us means websites that are still

00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:45,509
perfectly usable five years from now for

00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:48,689
our clients I'm also involved in the

00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:50,579
Dutch Drupal community at the board of

00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:52,920
the Dutch to pound a shin and I've been

00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:55,500
doing Drupal jam or sort of local

00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:58,409
drupalcon for the past four years it's

00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:02,850
very fun to do very learn full intense

00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:05,510
but also a very rewarding so for me on a

00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:08,110
personal level rupal has

00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:10,330
has many up sites that I've been

00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:13,480
thankful for over the past few years

00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:15,980
I've been involved in in projects for

00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:18,680
ikea World Food Program port of

00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:20,540
rotterdam amongst others that and it's

00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:24,760
it's from those projects that i'll be

00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:24,760
sharing some insights with you so

00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:31,490
growing the drupal pie before i talk

00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:35,810
about that i have two questions for you

00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:38,000
who of you in the room is involved in

00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:43,070
seals pre-sales consultancy raise your

00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:46,810
hand okay good okay so and who is who's

00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:50,450
not into development raise hands okay

00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:52,640
right so just I know I'm do have the

00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:55,610
right presentation with me growing the

00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:59,209
Drupal pie piece has been talking about

00:02:55,610 --> 00:03:01,070
that in the past few years which all

00:02:59,209 --> 00:03:05,060
means getting more business on Drupal

00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:08,000
right so when it comes to Drupal we want

00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:10,040
more projects more clients adopting

00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,390
Drupal getting new clients on board

00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:13,520
getting different clients on board right

00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:16,489
and as much as I'd like to see

00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:19,430
open-source spread among other types of

00:03:16,489 --> 00:03:23,150
clients among bigger clients what I see

00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:26,300
is that the values of community code

00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:28,340
right which we are about is not longer

00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:30,800
the predominant factor of choice for

00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:32,690
many clients especially clients that

00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:34,190
have been there for a couple of times

00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:35,780
right they have done their website for

00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:40,040
two or three times and they have evolved

00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:42,410
to some next stage where they have they

00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:44,000
have seen the functionality they have

00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:45,739
seen what the code does and it's

00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,080
remarkably well but if they've started

00:03:45,739 --> 00:03:53,090
to think in a broader sense and they are

00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:56,330
seeking help in in the area of return on

00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:58,400
investment right measurable KPIs digital

00:03:56,330 --> 00:04:01,400
strategy and all sorts of online

00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:04,370
ambitions that they get to the table

00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:07,910
with that they seek help with right even

00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:10,340
from us as shops and I believe if we can

00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:12,769
somehow hook on to those sort of newer

00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:14,360
needs to us it's it's there where we

00:04:12,769 --> 00:04:16,130
actually win the hearts and minds

00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:18,470
more and more of businesses that we get

00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:20,600
it to our tables so when it's about

00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:22,970
growing to do papai I believe that we

00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:24,500
had we need to include those topics into

00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:29,000
the conversations that we are having

00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:31,070
with our clients so what I observe it's

00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:35,930
not just about the community I mean it's

00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:37,940
wonderful right and it is fortunately on

00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:39,950
many occasions it's a good factor of

00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:42,830
choice but it's it's mean the community

00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:44,870
is unknown to certain clients that we

00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:47,660
get to the table it's also no longer

00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:49,850
about good code it still is but not just

00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:52,160
Google right it's not longer about just

00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:54,260
functionalities but it's they need more

00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:57,740
they require a different type of help

00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:59,419
they require other expertise social

00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:01,550
rational helps talking I mean we're all

00:04:59,419 --> 00:05:03,650
very rational people especially when

00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:07,490
you're dealing with code it's very

00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:10,070
binary at sometimes but that's not where

00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:12,910
we always strike our potential clients

00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:15,230
in their heart right that's not always a

00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:17,360
predominant factor for choosing us

00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:20,240
really an assumption is the mother of

00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:22,220
all fuckups I believe that there is many

00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,590
assumptions that we still do the client

00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:26,840
still do right but also when we talk to

00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:29,419
clients and do projects with them we

00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:31,010
assume that they see the beauty of our

00:05:29,419 --> 00:05:33,110
community they see the beauty of the

00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:35,240
code they understand the agile values

00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:36,620
and so forth so I think there's many

00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:38,540
love and attention that needs to be

00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:41,479
going there and it's these observations

00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:43,520
that I will be trying to sort of give

00:05:41,479 --> 00:05:45,229
you some insights in today hopefully

00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,479
inspire you and I'm very interested to

00:05:45,229 --> 00:05:53,060
hear from you how you experience those

00:05:47,479 --> 00:05:55,790
in your projects okay so I'm going to

00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:57,440
back up a little little falafel Asafa

00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:59,479
chol spiritual truth that have come to

00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:02,290
hold dear comes from a book that I've

00:05:59,479 --> 00:06:05,600
been reading about a few years ago

00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:08,570
reading the book called a conversation

00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:10,490
with God I Neale Donald Walsch it's not

00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:14,330
a religious book but it has some very

00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:19,190
interesting perspectives on some very

00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:22,130
traditional religious beliefs and the

00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:24,470
dichotomy between light and dark is fear

00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:25,729
and love where there is different types

00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:28,099
of energy on the fierce

00:06:25,729 --> 00:06:31,309
it's very much about control about

00:06:28,099 --> 00:06:34,430
contract about scheme about hide right

00:06:31,309 --> 00:06:37,249
where the love energy allow and expand

00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:41,089
and are based on trust and so forth and

00:06:37,249 --> 00:06:43,219
I started to recognize this dichotomy

00:06:41,089 --> 00:06:45,949
and started to recognize the various

00:06:43,219 --> 00:06:49,460
types of energies in in that balance and

00:06:45,949 --> 00:06:53,120
all sorts of web of personal scenarios

00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:55,779
as well as business where I I noticed

00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:58,309
that fortunately more and more people

00:06:55,779 --> 00:07:00,499
even the business people and management

00:06:58,309 --> 00:07:02,899
that you get to the table they have done

00:07:00,499 --> 00:07:04,249
it a couple of times they they do have

00:07:02,899 --> 00:07:06,740
good contracts you should always have

00:07:04,249 --> 00:07:10,219
good contracts but they just don't rely

00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:13,699
only on that side of the balance so if

00:07:10,219 --> 00:07:15,770
you look at successful brands you see

00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:18,559
that loyalty loyalty leaders they grow

00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:22,430
faster than their competitor average and

00:07:18,559 --> 00:07:24,860
you reap when you read about them it's

00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:29,210
interesting to see that those brands

00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:30,949
have come to to gradually adopt the the

00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:33,709
law of elements and the love energies on

00:07:30,949 --> 00:07:37,370
the elite economy and where tools are no

00:07:33,709 --> 00:07:40,189
longer prime criteria of choice but also

00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:43,339
other things like trust and cooperation

00:07:40,189 --> 00:07:45,589
and mutual success committing to mutual

00:07:43,339 --> 00:07:47,930
success right and they demand help from

00:07:45,589 --> 00:07:50,020
agencies much like ourselves not only

00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:53,839
building great functionality but also

00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:57,319
offering services in the field where we

00:07:53,839 --> 00:08:00,770
can help them create their success or

00:07:57,319 --> 00:08:03,529
offer services or people skills experts

00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:06,169
whatnot in achieving their online

00:08:03,529 --> 00:08:08,419
editions whatever they need to be and I

00:08:06,169 --> 00:08:11,240
believe I think that if we want to stay

00:08:08,419 --> 00:08:13,610
relevant in our business it's perfectly

00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:16,370
alright we have we're very good at

00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:18,199
delivering these kick-ass websites we

00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:20,029
have specialties we have Nicias that's

00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:22,819
that's all right and we can stay about

00:08:20,029 --> 00:08:25,370
because focus is good but I think we

00:08:22,819 --> 00:08:28,580
should also find people or gather them

00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:31,080
around us that are able to help us with

00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:34,440
other areas of expertise

00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:36,870
so if you can create a slightly broader

00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:38,219
package in really understanding the

00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:40,229
online emissions and needs of our

00:08:38,219 --> 00:08:42,930
clients that's where we start to

00:08:40,229 --> 00:08:45,000
innovate surface right serves innovation

00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:46,760
or service design which is about

00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,589
creating a great customer experience

00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:51,360
where the physical performance is is as

00:08:49,589 --> 00:08:54,720
much as about the product and the

00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:56,640
website and the tools that we are set to

00:08:54,720 --> 00:09:00,779
create for them right which we do very

00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:03,000
well we touch the senses with all sorts

00:09:00,779 --> 00:09:05,310
of additional cool stuff new

00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,980
technologies AR virtuality and whatnot

00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:09,720
but if we can really raise the hairs on

00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:11,670
the arms of people not just our clients

00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:13,170
but also their users and their customers

00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:16,410
that's where we touch them in their

00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:19,740
hearts and we raise emotions on all the

00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:22,110
touch points from the outside in as the

00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:24,630
lease was mentioning so where we've been

00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:28,800
years and years sitting on the chairs of

00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:30,450
our customers looking outward we are

00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:33,480
gradually bringing in people these days

00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:36,570
that are willing to go out there stand

00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:38,010
in that line experience what are you

00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:40,260
know what the users of our clients are

00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:43,920
actually experiencing and bring that

00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:46,170
outside experience in with us so how do

00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:48,839
you create how do you create that how do

00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:51,810
you go about that first there is the

00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:53,610
performance which is the rational bit

00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:55,430
right where we create a kick-ass

00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:57,839
performance that exceeds expectations

00:09:55,430 --> 00:10:00,420
obviously we do things very well on our

00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:02,399
clients they say to us yet it works

00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:04,310
great and by the way that extra feature

00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:06,510
that you threw in that's awesome right

00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:08,610
that's very much about product peaches

00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:11,579
that's about quality that's about price

00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:14,010
and all the criteria that we've come you

00:10:11,579 --> 00:10:16,620
know we're used to when we do in our FBS

00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:21,209
and pitches and bring in new clients

00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:23,310
onto onto Drupal whereas the emotional

00:10:21,209 --> 00:10:25,769
focus is about the heart and we delight

00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:27,750
customers in a personal way not just our

00:10:25,769 --> 00:10:29,970
customers but also their customers right

00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:32,190
and their customers to create an

00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:34,260
experience where somehow we get to know

00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:35,610
that they say they know me they listen

00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:37,769
to me and they actually have

00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:40,230
for the same values where people way say

00:10:37,769 --> 00:10:41,670
wow that's amazing right we all come

00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:43,410
across certain websites that we say oh

00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:44,730
wow that's amazing what they did there

00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:48,029
right this is not just good but they

00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:51,480
inspire us as well and that's that's the

00:10:48,029 --> 00:10:54,000
area that I see we need to be and more

00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:56,220
and more that clients see other

00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,649
experiences the other projects the other

00:10:56,220 --> 00:11:00,450
things on the web that they come to us

00:10:58,649 --> 00:11:04,950
and say well I want that experience as

00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:06,870
well help me create that so the key

00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:08,550
question is are you striving to be

00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:10,529
meaningful for people are you are just

00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:13,920
trying to get that website done well or

00:11:10,529 --> 00:11:15,810
if I sit down with clients I asked in

00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:17,579
the first time are you trying to be mean

00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:19,769
if I you're just trying to sell products

00:11:17,579 --> 00:11:22,740
right just just trying to get your thing

00:11:19,769 --> 00:11:24,779
across and this is an important question

00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:26,970
that we need to convince clients that we

00:11:24,779 --> 00:11:30,600
can think along the lines in act and

00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:33,480
helping them ask this question right so

00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:37,350
does anyone know the example on the

00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:41,399
background have you seen that this test

00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:43,980
I was right so Tesco in Korea apparently

00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:45,510
the Koreans are among them they have the

00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:47,790
among the longest working days in the

00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:49,470
world so they found a way where people

00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:52,260
can scan a new products with their

00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:54,839
phones and even while they wait the the

00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:56,790
order is being prepped and such that's a

00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:59,420
wonderful way how they're really you

00:11:56,790 --> 00:12:02,399
know improve the lives of people and

00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:07,320
uplifted a thing that they have in their

00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:09,899
culture into a good thing so how do we

00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:14,339
know the client is ready this is a

00:12:09,899 --> 00:12:15,959
maturity map it by the way all the the

00:12:14,339 --> 00:12:19,110
sources are at the bottom of the slides

00:12:15,959 --> 00:12:20,910
if we put them online later I really

00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:22,260
urge you to take a look at all time

00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:25,110
eater they have some wonderful templates

00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:26,820
for this this is the social business

00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:28,470
government governance maturity met but

00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:30,300
they you have many maturity maps but

00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:33,000
they all sort of cover the same things

00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:36,000
right when there's where you can map the

00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:38,699
state of evolution of your clients on to

00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,920
where they're at start with ad hoc where

00:12:38,699 --> 00:12:43,140
there's they have a website but it's

00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:44,870
just runs they have analytics but they

00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:47,360
don't know the login on

00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:49,460
to a more sort of planning state where

00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:51,050
they plan things and they have some form

00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:52,550
of governance but there's no coherence

00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:55,010
and there's no mandate for the people

00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:57,320
doing doing the actual work right on to

00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:59,270
formalize and so forth and it does does

00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:01,400
it does not just involve the product

00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:04,130
involves people flows policy and so

00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:06,440
forth and this is a great way to to

00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:08,480
discern your different clients to know

00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:11,720
where they are at you know in their in

00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:14,420
their digital life span if you will so

00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:15,980
if you get a client on to the table says

00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:17,480
well we have a website what we don't do

00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:19,400
anything with analytics and by the way

00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:21,920
do you know if we have it they're very

00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:24,710
much in that early stage right we see

00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:27,529
that a lot its many clients are still in

00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:31,130
stage one or two and I believe that for

00:13:27,529 --> 00:13:32,930
us as digital agencies it's our job to

00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:34,820
you know to help them understand that

00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:38,450
they're there and help them make that

00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:40,700
next step so I got many many but

00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:43,160
sometimes clients that have wonderful

00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:45,050
plans right online ambitions all sorts

00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:49,220
of things that we we get happy from

00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:51,350
right seems like well thought maybe

00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:54,830
found someplace else doesn't matter but

00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:57,890
okay if you want to be at that stage if

00:13:54,830 --> 00:14:00,440
you want to really realize these online

00:13:57,890 --> 00:14:03,500
ambitions that you put here we need to

00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:05,959
get you to that second stage right and

00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:07,670
it involves not just a kick-ass website

00:14:05,959 --> 00:14:10,040
but you also need to do some other

00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:14,900
things about people about policy about

00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:17,930
processes and so forth so getting into

00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:20,480
the clients state of need you know

00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:22,040
understanding even though it's not your

00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:24,470
core business even though it's not your

00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:26,660
specialty but understanding that they're

00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:29,390
actually at that stage will you know

00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:32,570
will actually help form a proper answer

00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:35,839
for them and help increase the chances

00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:38,360
of getting their success online because

00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:39,980
it will involve a different type of

00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:41,930
proposal for them you need other things

00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:44,430
to be in there

00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:51,780
so if we talk about success what is

00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:53,670
success i I'm involved in pre-sales

00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:55,800
consultancy as well and I share my

00:14:53,670 --> 00:15:00,450
experience with the the people that I'm

00:14:55,800 --> 00:15:03,990
well that we that we invite and welcome

00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:05,580
and the key question I always ask them

00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:08,400
is what is success have you thought

00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:11,850
about what is success going to be for

00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:14,730
you in regards to the website when will

00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:16,650
you be happy right not just at go life

00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:18,600
but a year from now have you thought

00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:20,910
about that where is it hanging on the

00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:23,880
wall and if not I urge them to take that

00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:26,340
exercise to think about success in a way

00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:27,960
that's measurable in a way that you can

00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:29,610
hang on your wall and people will

00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:32,030
understand not just management but also

00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:34,620
the team right because all the small

00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:39,660
decisions as starting at the design

00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:42,570
phase will need to serve the KPIs that

00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:44,640
you'll you'll be defining the measurable

00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:48,150
kpi's key performance indicators the

00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:50,520
goals that you can measure and what I

00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:52,140
call definition of success I mean of

00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:55,440
course we can build a multi-site of

00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:57,360
course we can build a great community

00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,850
with all sorts of users and rise and all

00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:02,340
functionalities right but what people

00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:04,380
will be looking at the site do you know

00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:06,570
them are there different target groups

00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:08,220
have you spotted them already do you

00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:10,640
have some data there do you know what

00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:13,740
they need right have you have you

00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:16,020
investigated that because ultimately

00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:18,600
that's what the site will be doing and

00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:21,210
that's what we need to measure if it's

00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:24,600
actually working a year from now or

00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:27,690
happy here right so this is a model that

00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:29,760
we sometimes use the ADA model they have

00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:33,030
several templates there that you can use

00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:35,760
in download where a stands for attention

00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:37,320
obviously you know the traffic interest

00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:40,290
is the long till traffic where you can

00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:42,840
actually see people sort of taking the

00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:45,330
right path on the website desire is

00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:49,320
getting them into some funnel right and

00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:50,110
obviously action is like converting from

00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:53,350
anonymous to

00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:55,709
anonymous there's always data there

00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:58,899
right that you can sort of measure

00:16:55,709 --> 00:17:03,970
what's already there even even the

00:16:58,899 --> 00:17:05,980
thinnest of datasets will help you get

00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:07,770
some benchmark of where your client is

00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:12,699
that but there's different types as well

00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:15,069
obviously I've seen actually the very

00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:17,410
measurable goal where we had to decrease

00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:21,640
the number of defects from 47 to 12 per

00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:24,309
month others include the time to market

00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:26,500
right how long it takes to to actually

00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:28,690
create a new user or deploy a new

00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:31,210
functionality and believe it or not

00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:33,340
there are still clients small and large

00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:36,700
that will it will take for them a week

00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:39,580
to get a new for them for one a client

00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:42,520
of theirs to create one one new user for

00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:44,620
their clients so that's an incredible

00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:49,780
time to market really that you're out

00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:53,770
there to improve so if you can you know

00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:55,510
not just if you understand that this is

00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:58,000
what it's about but also can bring in

00:17:55,510 --> 00:18:02,610
the help or or maybe even from your own

00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:05,320
agency help your your clients in

00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:08,650
determining the KPIs that you need hang

00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:10,330
it out on your wall many things but that

00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:11,710
these are one of the keys that need to

00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:13,929
be out there that everyone understands

00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:17,230
and that your team members are also able

00:18:13,929 --> 00:18:19,450
to explain to others that's that's where

00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:22,299
I see the glimmering the eyes of clients

00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:24,730
i take thing that they say okay this

00:18:22,299 --> 00:18:26,350
agency builds websites they do well but

00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:28,690
i understand that i need additional help

00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:31,240
there right and that's where we were

00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:34,480
while we're not actually having people

00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:36,520
on staff doing this necessarily we bring

00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:40,240
in other people that are able to do the

00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:43,410
conversation with our clients so this is

00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:46,510
an example of a customer journey right

00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:48,940
sometimes a scary word because it sounds

00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:52,270
complex it is sometimes there's many

00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:54,790
templates about mapping journeys not

00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:57,820
just online but the journeys that that

00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:59,410
clients do you know when they think over

00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:00,540
their website and they go to a real

00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:03,330
store and they

00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:06,060
just you know turn away or cancel

00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:07,350
whatever and you can map all the soft

00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:10,050
points and the touch points and

00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:11,700
everything that they run into so that

00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:13,620
you can actually show to your client

00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:16,290
this is where we need to improve i was

00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:18,660
looking at this and we did in previous

00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:22,140
lives get this were for in some projects

00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:25,500
i found Drita's keynote from austin

00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:27,900
texas and his analogy remarkably helpful

00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:30,360
where he is telling about the users

00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:32,250
journey for making a photo which

00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:34,260
essentially over the years just just

00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:36,120
became simpler right steps were taking

00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:39,750
out it got shorter shorter and

00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:42,090
simplified obviously and now only two

00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:45,240
steps and i literally showed this

00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:47,100
example 20 to a relatively large scale

00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:51,840
enterprise project which we want a

00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:54,240
drupal that converted to the to the

00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:56,190
webmasters analogy because larger

00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:58,470
companies will have people on staff that

00:19:56,190 --> 00:20:03,120
need to be doing things themselves right

00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:04,710
with drupal so there they used to be

00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:06,750
doing all sorts of things they needed to

00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:09,510
do all sorts of things to get stuff done

00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:11,370
online or on their website which you

00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:14,840
know with the latest increment of Drupal

00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:14,840
has become just simplified or

00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:20,520
disintermediated or just the middleman

00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:22,830
is taken out right whether it's some

00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:26,220
technical people whether it's an

00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:27,990
external vendor I've had business owners

00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:30,360
and stakeholders come to me and say okay

00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:32,460
so I'll be able to actually create my

00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:34,860
own users or business rules yes i'm

00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:37,550
going to show you in three weeks right

00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:39,960
and this is where you actually not only

00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:41,580
get the rational arguments but also

00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:44,989
touch them in their hearts because

00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:52,590
that's that's where they can happy right

00:20:44,989 --> 00:20:56,220
so here's another example more daily day

00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:57,809
to day thing about drag and drop right

00:20:56,220 --> 00:21:00,570
and this is a video reel that we show

00:20:57,809 --> 00:21:02,039
when we do pitches and I was in a

00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:04,619
meeting a couple of weeks ago and there

00:21:02,039 --> 00:21:06,450
were about seven people like you know

00:21:04,619 --> 00:21:09,269
the marketing manager and people from

00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:11,059
marketing and people who were actually

00:21:09,269 --> 00:21:13,350
doing the content and there was this

00:21:11,059 --> 00:21:15,299
lady in the back and she was very quiet

00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:17,369
and all of a sudden she said well so

00:21:15,299 --> 00:21:19,350
I'll be finally able to you know

00:21:17,369 --> 00:21:22,889
rearrange my own menu and drag and drop

00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:24,659
my the items in my view I said yes this

00:21:22,889 --> 00:21:26,879
is how it's done right and this is just

00:21:24,659 --> 00:21:30,269
this is an example of one of our other

00:21:26,879 --> 00:21:31,859
projects they requested a real life

00:21:30,269 --> 00:21:35,220
example at the time which we gave on the

00:21:31,859 --> 00:21:36,659
spot a demo on the spot but she said

00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:38,489
well I'm used to WordPress and it works

00:21:36,659 --> 00:21:40,350
remarkably well now we're drupal 6 and

00:21:38,489 --> 00:21:43,109
it's been a pain for so long and when we

00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:45,809
when you actually show how it's done and

00:21:43,109 --> 00:21:50,369
how you relieve also their pains you

00:21:45,809 --> 00:21:52,440
know even from the seemingly well people

00:21:50,369 --> 00:21:54,779
that are you know just doing the content

00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:57,119
three days a week if you improve their

00:21:54,779 --> 00:21:58,739
lives you're also going to make the

00:21:57,119 --> 00:22:00,029
lives of their managers the content of

00:21:58,739 --> 00:22:02,070
content managers and the marketing

00:22:00,029 --> 00:22:03,690
managers happy because there will be

00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:08,669
less people complaining about how they

00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:11,159
go about with CMS so ultimately all

00:22:08,669 --> 00:22:14,460
success hinges on people working

00:22:11,159 --> 00:22:18,809
together right in human relationships

00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:21,379
and I I find that onboarding them in our

00:22:18,809 --> 00:22:24,450
ways of thinking is a great way of

00:22:21,379 --> 00:22:26,279
winning the you know not only the minds

00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:28,710
but also the hearts of the business

00:22:26,279 --> 00:22:30,570
people because they'll understand that

00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:32,249
they found a party that's that's you

00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:34,649
know that will take them by their hand

00:22:32,249 --> 00:22:37,049
even though it takes a lot of time even

00:22:34,649 --> 00:22:40,309
though we assume you know they yes we've

00:22:37,049 --> 00:22:43,220
done agile a couple of times this is a

00:22:40,309 --> 00:22:46,980
great video by the way we also have them

00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:48,010
the image as a template and we show that

00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:52,360
to them

00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:54,790
on the remarkable responsibility of the

00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:59,320
product owner right which is a very

00:22:54,790 --> 00:23:01,390
important roles you probably know that

00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:04,630
worked for for them and I had the

00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:06,400
privilege at that time to work with a an

00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:08,650
agile coach that was helping us out

00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:14,020
there who had no vested interest in the

00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:16,480
project but if not I always urge our

00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:18,910
clients in our projects to at least do

00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:20,980
some sort of onboarding with us to

00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:22,720
understand our ways of thinking even

00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:27,250
though they have been you know having

00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:30,330
some experience with agile so this is

00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:34,630
about rewarding a little bit about agile

00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:36,450
MVP Minimum Viable Product right it's

00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:38,770
always nice to have a client that

00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:40,540
understands what agile is about or at

00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:42,760
least you know the basic principles even

00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:45,850
though they haven't had the experience

00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:48,610
if they know what MVP stands for if they

00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:51,640
do have a backlog that's that's just you

00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:54,400
know the very first step still we see a

00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:56,470
lot of tendency to clients having say

00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:58,120
okay we want to work at agile but we

00:23:56,470 --> 00:24:02,380
still need to have it all in there right

00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:03,790
which is basically not agile so this is

00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:06,190
one of the hardest discussions that we

00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:07,960
have about minimal Viable Product about

00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:10,960
you know what what you essentially need

00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:12,340
to get in business that's very nice

00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:13,870
feature right that you have frequently

00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:15,900
asked questions but you will do with a

00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:18,070
page for now right we can get online and

00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:20,140
this is a lot of the discussion that we

00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:26,670
this is probably you know one of the

00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:29,380
single most often taken off the walls

00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:32,020
slides that I have that we bring down

00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:34,900
onto the table in the conversation there

00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:36,640
is a sign out there right because there

00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:39,670
is many increment increments of this

00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:42,100
many versions of this image I haven't

00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:44,640
had a client that came for a car and

00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:46,960
went out happy with a skateboard but

00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:49,660
that's not what it's about really right

00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:51,850
I just want to make them understand

00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:53,290
what do you need to get in business you

00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:57,220
know you need to get that conversation

00:24:53,290 --> 00:25:00,970
rolling so if you can get your client to

00:24:57,220 --> 00:25:03,780
overcome the fear of losing scope

00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:06,460
because squeezing in all in ultimately

00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:09,040
lulu's the scope anyway because we can't

00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:12,340
do it all right in the time or budget

00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:14,290
frame so that works remarkably well so

00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:16,090
this you know you bring this to the

00:25:14,290 --> 00:25:17,650
table it sounds like a good story but

00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:23,620
the real pain comes when you do your

00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:26,260
projects gradually into their experience

00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:34,120
which is you know where the hearts and

00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:36,280
minds are hubspot is an American I think

00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:38,170
American vendor of digital marketing

00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:40,810
software I haven't used it but I've

00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:43,330
looked at it I I got the whole culture

00:25:40,810 --> 00:25:48,250
and there were some remarkable values in

00:25:43,330 --> 00:25:50,260
there that really well resonated with me

00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:52,900
and one of them is that they are

00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:54,670
radically and uncomfortably transparent

00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:57,580
and I'm a great advocate for

00:25:54,670 --> 00:26:00,160
transparency and you know openness and

00:25:57,580 --> 00:26:03,760
be clear about everything so if you have

00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:06,490
something in your project that has

00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:07,750
meaning I hang it on the wall right I

00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:09,550
take it out hanging on the wall for

00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:11,260
everyone to see not just upper

00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:14,230
management not just a team but everyone

00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:16,870
right because if it does something why

00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:19,150
not take it out there and I tell this to

00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:20,830
clients even at our first meeting you

00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:23,110
know that we want to we want to be

00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:24,540
transparent we don't hold anything back

00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:27,040
in some sort of risk management

00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:28,840
documentation or whatnot if it has

00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:31,800
meaning we take it out there and it

00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:34,570
seems uncomfortable at the beginning but

00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:36,010
you know I've seen projects work or

00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:37,180
actually you know the upper management

00:26:36,010 --> 00:26:38,530
of client says well that's very

00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:42,370
interesting we should do that more often

00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:44,820
right even in a way where the actual

00:26:42,370 --> 00:26:48,140
team who needs to resolve everything

00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:50,840
understands it as well

00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:52,700
a little bit about agile values and

00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:56,060
about agile I'm a strong believer in

00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:57,920
agile because many of the values on the

00:26:56,060 --> 00:27:01,790
on the only love side of the economy

00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:05,630
like like trust and cooperation are

00:27:01,790 --> 00:27:07,760
embedded in there right when I was young

00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:10,850
I was with the boy scouts and there was

00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:15,410
the Boy Scout rule even though it's it's

00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:17,390
well obviously based on you know sort of

00:27:15,410 --> 00:27:20,330
military traditions there are also very

00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:22,220
some very strong values in there the Boy

00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:23,810
Scout will essentially says everything

00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:26,600
that you touch your pickup you need to

00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:30,350
leave at a you know as it was or

00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:32,330
preferably in a better state and I just

00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:35,090
an image like this was also on the wall

00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:37,370
because I i found it working remarkably

00:27:35,090 --> 00:27:39,230
well where you know not just our team

00:27:37,370 --> 00:27:42,380
but also had a client team come to us

00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:44,120
say look you have the scrum board but

00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:45,920
why isn't anything moving you know it's

00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:47,870
not clear to me well it's clear for us

00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:50,180
people say right the team says well we

00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:52,100
understand it yes but it's not just for

00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:54,320
you it's also for your client your

00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:56,090
product on your stakeholders right so

00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:59,330
you need to leave everything you know

00:27:56,090 --> 00:28:00,950
it's it's it's for your peers really and

00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:03,440
I find you know it doesn't necessarily

00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:05,390
have to be this rule but I find that you

00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:09,530
know getting out your your core values

00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:11,210
that that are really as a human work for

00:28:09,530 --> 00:28:13,190
you well have worked for you well and

00:28:11,210 --> 00:28:16,370
illustrate on how you want to deal with

00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:19,520
others take it out there express it and

00:28:16,370 --> 00:28:22,570
hang it on your wall and I tell clients

00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:24,340
that we do this

00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:26,620
which is different than what they're

00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:30,250
used to and it works for them right and

00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:32,230
their hearts and minds so proper product

00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:34,240
development is perfectly okay because

00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:36,340
that's what we outline we can do as well

00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:39,130
right where we have a very strong

00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:41,169
specialty and we can have a very good

00:28:39,130 --> 00:28:43,870
business for that years to come all of

00:28:41,169 --> 00:28:45,639
us right but consider that you may need

00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:50,820
more to stay relevant and win the hearts

00:28:45,639 --> 00:28:50,820
and minds of businesses so to sum up

00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:55,929
expand to service design combined great

00:28:54,490 --> 00:28:58,870
performance with customer experience to

00:28:55,929 --> 00:29:00,460
add value to people's lives right you

00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:02,440
don't have to do that yourself you can

00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:04,600
form unions with people around you

00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:07,720
people that you can trust we've brought

00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:10,529
in some remarkable people that we form

00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:13,029
partnerships with that are helping us

00:29:10,529 --> 00:29:15,970
not just you know create a kick-ass

00:29:13,029 --> 00:29:19,000
website but to actually set a great

00:29:15,970 --> 00:29:23,440
customer experience and in so doing help

00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:26,470
grow the Drupal by really right so

00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:28,450
building on trust not just contracts and

00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:30,490
the contracts need to be there I mean

00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:33,370
not saying we should abandon the

00:29:30,490 --> 00:29:36,929
contracts but also focus on trust and

00:29:33,370 --> 00:29:39,820
find recognize the clients that are

00:29:36,929 --> 00:29:41,529
willing to to grow there right even

00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:44,019
though they're very sort of risk and

00:29:41,529 --> 00:29:46,539
compliance traditional contracts

00:29:44,019 --> 00:29:49,330
regulated clients if you can find

00:29:46,539 --> 00:29:51,159
clients to say okay but we also want to

00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:54,269
make success together if you if you can

00:29:51,159 --> 00:29:56,980
feel that they're the values are there

00:29:54,269 --> 00:29:59,309
try to help them focus on the team not

00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:59,309
the terms

00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:07,180
okay so ensure definition of success so

00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:10,210
with measurable KPIs everyone is able to

00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:13,170
understand right so not just your client

00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:16,540
I just management but also your team

00:30:13,170 --> 00:30:19,510
your clients will come to demand more

00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:22,510
and more of you not just help with with

00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:23,950
a good product but also achieving you

00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:26,440
know their online goals their online

00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:28,150
revenue and so forth there's there's you

00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:30,160
may have a good group of sponsor in your

00:30:28,150 --> 00:30:33,220
client but there's people around them

00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:35,620
that will demand at least some return on

00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:38,170
investment that will demand to know how

00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:39,790
will we return the our investment a year

00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:43,120
from now you know when is the site going

00:30:39,790 --> 00:30:45,040
to be successful I'll line that with

00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:47,380
digital maturity right so know where

00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:48,850
your client is at so if you've come you

00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:51,520
know with customer experience and

00:30:48,850 --> 00:30:53,860
personas and journeys and so forth to a

00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:56,190
client that's not already there and

00:30:53,860 --> 00:31:00,610
still you're going to miss that mark

00:30:56,190 --> 00:31:03,370
show don't tell so go out there and meet

00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:07,030
the people lift through their stories

00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:08,800
stand in those lines and show the

00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:11,440
examples on how you did that you know

00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:13,750
show examples on how you're going to

00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:17,140
make the lives of people easier say okay

00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:18,670
don't worry the people from marketing or

00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:20,680
the people from IT I'm actually going to

00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:22,240
help your content people and I'm doing

00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:24,220
it like this and there's so many stuff

00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:26,590
out there that will help you illustrate

00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:30,030
there so understand what is needed use

00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:32,140
what's already there and it's so much

00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:34,090
lift through projects that you live

00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:36,520
through life right so don't be afraid to

00:31:34,090 --> 00:31:38,740
express your poor values you know not

00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:40,810
just as a company but also as as human

00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:43,810
beings forming a team you know among

00:31:40,810 --> 00:31:47,350
yourselves we have many sort of these

00:31:43,810 --> 00:31:49,990
things hanging on our wall but if I if I

00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:52,000
get the chance and that to a to a client

00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:54,280
premise and we do a project there I hang

00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,110
it on their walls as well right because

00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:59,100
that's our lives so we express that

00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:59,100
that's what we live through

00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:11,920
right so oh that's is in it gets away

00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:11,920
actually there was my last slide

00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:24,160
anyway that was my last slide so that

00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:29,860
was my rep thank you are there any

00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:31,600
questions yet yes yes thanks uh before

00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:33,310
too much time goes by there was a slight

00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:36,430
number three where you had some little

00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:40,750
logos of five minutes 15 minutes 55

00:32:36,430 --> 00:32:42,280
minutes I honest I'm maybe I'm just slow

00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:44,410
but I can't figure out what what that

00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:51,250
meant could you please explain the slide

00:32:44,410 --> 00:32:56,260
oh yeah this one that is a good but yeah

00:32:51,250 --> 00:33:01,240
this is actually it is it says meant as

00:32:56,260 --> 00:33:04,890
an illustration on on where you have

00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:07,830
like the more properties that you define

00:33:04,890 --> 00:33:09,720
the more granular

00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:12,510
definition of success that you have

00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:14,760
actually I was trying to say make sure

00:33:12,510 --> 00:33:17,490
that you have thought about some

00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:20,100
measurable numbers but maybe the visual

00:33:17,490 --> 00:33:30,679
doesn't work very well in this one thank

00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:30,679
you anyway else oh yes sir yeah

00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:46,580
yep

00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:56,350
nice

00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:12,880
okay well like I'm not sure if this um

00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:16,650
be able to answer that but it's because

00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:19,740
we're a drupal shop ourselves right so

00:34:16,650 --> 00:34:21,640
we're biased I tell them that

00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:24,220
fortunately we have a lot of business

00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:27,790
from from companies that are either on

00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:30,910
Drupal or are considering it I also have

00:34:27,790 --> 00:34:34,390
experience in the field where where we

00:34:30,910 --> 00:34:36,940
weren't a Drupal shopper say there were

00:34:34,390 --> 00:34:39,040
other technologies as well the right

00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:42,460
tool for the job what I can tell you is

00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:44,980
we came across a request from a client

00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:47,140
two months ago that was totally not our

00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:49,540
thing and totally na Drupal and I tell

00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:53,470
them that I say well I will consider it

00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:55,750
but I respectfully decline ultimately

00:34:53,470 --> 00:34:59,710
right because Drupal is not the right

00:34:55,750 --> 00:35:01,870
tool and and we can make we can make it

00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:03,280
into grupal we can force it in there but

00:35:01,870 --> 00:35:05,740
it's going to be so much heartache and

00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:10,150
pain for our people which I don't I

00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:12,990
don't want to really does that help help

00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:12,990
answer your question okay

00:35:13,290 --> 00:35:18,470
anyway else yep

00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:34,640
hmm

00:35:39,850 --> 00:35:47,660
yeah it's a good question also there's

00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:49,190
there's there is many occasion that

00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:50,300
we're just further down the line and we

00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:53,330
just need to build according to

00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:55,550
specification right still I asked them

00:35:53,330 --> 00:35:57,740
about okay very nice but what's the

00:35:55,550 --> 00:36:00,140
bigger scheme of things where is the

00:35:57,740 --> 00:36:02,300
online plan for that do you have the

00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:06,530
KPIs there but what does it need to do

00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:08,570
right I asked about that even though

00:36:06,530 --> 00:36:09,740
we're just five steps down I need to

00:36:08,570 --> 00:36:12,950
build according to technical

00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:15,680
specification and quiet well

00:36:12,950 --> 00:36:18,560
occasionally they have that occasionally

00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:21,440
they don't I say well we still can build

00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:25,520
this for you it's going to cost that

00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:27,920
right which is two proposal but I'd also

00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:29,780
be very interested to to you know to

00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:32,870
know about how you're going to make this

00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:34,790
to success obviously I can help you can

00:36:32,870 --> 00:36:36,860
find others that that are able to help

00:36:34,790 --> 00:36:45,230
but i do want to open up that

00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:47,270
conversation still yeah anyone yes yeah

00:36:45,230 --> 00:36:49,340
i'm just if you're allowed to talk about

00:36:47,270 --> 00:36:51,620
it i'm dying a curiosity what was that

00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:56,720
client spected would not have worked in

00:36:51,620 --> 00:37:00,310
drupal yeah that was a municipal website

00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:03,800
that we built in holland so the website

00:37:00,310 --> 00:37:05,120
is there on drupal there is a drupal

00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:07,940
distribution for dutch million

00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:10,070
municipalities and it works great but

00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:12,080
then there was another division of the

00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:15,950
municipality that came to us and wanted

00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:19,720
to hook onto some ESB and an archive

00:37:15,950 --> 00:37:22,280
system and they said well you know the

00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:23,720
guys from from communication and

00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:25,970
marketing they have some great

00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:28,190
experience with you guys we have this

00:37:25,970 --> 00:37:30,470
need can you also fit it into Drupal

00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:33,860
because we need to stay within you know

00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:35,990
a limited number of platforms so really

00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:39,080
the question was sort of steered to us

00:37:35,990 --> 00:37:41,660
by the fact that they want wanted it in

00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:43,970
Drupal as a sort of mandate so keep keep

00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:45,619
everything within one framework as much

00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:50,450
as possible

00:37:45,619 --> 00:37:53,509
so yeah we need to to build a repository

00:37:50,450 --> 00:37:55,579
that would disclose all sorts of digital

00:37:53,509 --> 00:38:07,369
digital scan documents really for the

00:37:55,579 --> 00:38:09,470
public that was it yeah yes and also

00:38:07,369 --> 00:38:12,049
there were there were many technical

00:38:09,470 --> 00:38:14,539
aspects involved that they wanted fixed

00:38:12,049 --> 00:38:17,630
price and we just didn't know about that

00:38:14,539 --> 00:38:19,190
at that time so you know as it goes with

00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:21,650
fixed price if you need to involve that

00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:23,359
much risk you need to increase the price

00:38:21,650 --> 00:38:27,430
and so forth so so that didn't work out

00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:27,430
for us yes sir

00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,560
ok

00:38:51,330 --> 00:38:58,870
yeah as a as a as a Drupal agency we

00:38:55,270 --> 00:39:01,600
have several partnerships with design

00:38:58,870 --> 00:39:03,340
agencies why agencies that do that so we

00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:05,440
do them do it ourselves but we

00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:07,810
understand the value you say this is

00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:10,270
this so so yeah we we talk about that

00:39:07,810 --> 00:39:12,460
but we bring in other people because we

00:39:10,270 --> 00:39:14,760
we see the value when we see the that

00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:17,110
the actual the benefit for the client

00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:19,210
there are some some Google design

00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:21,490
Sprint's that you know that they do in a

00:39:19,210 --> 00:39:26,380
week with rapid prototyping and such

00:39:21,490 --> 00:39:29,200
I've witnessed it myself at one point so

00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:32,460
so not our people we don't do it but our

00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:32,460
design partners do

00:39:46,130 --> 00:39:53,489
that's an interesting question often

00:39:50,099 --> 00:39:56,430
where we are at there is a you know

00:39:53,489 --> 00:39:59,400
there's a design clients want to see you

00:39:56,430 --> 00:40:01,229
know what's in the design when it's

00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:04,759
about the you know the backhand and the

00:40:01,229 --> 00:40:07,880
CMS obviously we sometimes we do a demo

00:40:04,759 --> 00:40:12,930
but it's already a quite functional demo

00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:14,670
but I wouldn't quite yet prototype a

00:40:12,930 --> 00:40:17,939
website just based on functionality

00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:20,789
because the the most clients just can't

00:40:17,939 --> 00:40:22,380
see through what's there you know and

00:40:20,789 --> 00:40:24,209
visualize the design in front of that

00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:26,479
they want to see the design clickable

00:40:24,209 --> 00:40:26,479
design

00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:35,369
uh-huh

00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:43,030
right now we does we do have had some

00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:47,280
requests where we had to set up a demo

00:40:43,030 --> 00:40:47,280
or we don't do that a lot yeah

00:40:55,869 --> 00:41:21,510
right haha yeah that's true yeah

00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:23,910
yeah yeah if you have the scenario of

00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:25,830
the of the business owner that's used to

00:41:23,910 --> 00:41:27,540
SharePoint and need and needs to be

00:41:25,830 --> 00:41:29,970
doing his stuff there for the past seven

00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:31,620
years and you show Drupal and say this

00:41:29,970 --> 00:41:35,870
is how would how you will be doing it

00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:35,870
this way that will help yeah absolutely

00:41:40,490 --> 00:41:43,490
uh-huh

00:41:44,789 --> 00:41:48,059
bring things

00:41:48,330 --> 00:41:51,330
hmm

00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:57,960
maturity of the client

00:42:13,930 --> 00:42:16,930
mm-hmm

00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:31,070
yeah yeah I see your point is

00:42:26,839 --> 00:42:32,599
interesting yeah that's interesting yeah

00:42:31,070 --> 00:42:39,430
we should do a discussion on that

00:42:32,599 --> 00:42:39,430
further in the back one more

00:42:42,910 --> 00:42:45,569
yep

00:43:03,950 --> 00:43:06,940
ok

00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:22,359
I that I wouldn't dare to answer I

00:43:19,859 --> 00:43:25,210
definitely had have a lot of more

00:43:22,359 --> 00:43:28,240
questions for that to answer but if it's

00:43:25,210 --> 00:43:30,030
about content I am we talk about content

00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:32,230
migration we will talk about content

00:43:30,030 --> 00:43:34,599
pre-production of content staging right

00:43:32,230 --> 00:43:36,970
and setting up an environment where

00:43:34,599 --> 00:43:39,849
where your client is able to do things

00:43:36,970 --> 00:43:42,910
with their content halfway the project

00:43:39,849 --> 00:43:46,060
for example right because if you're if

00:43:42,910 --> 00:43:48,790
you're putting in content from place a

00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:52,900
to place be you need to start early with

00:43:48,790 --> 00:43:56,710
that because quite often it's just not

00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:57,700
just a new website with the same

00:43:56,710 --> 00:44:00,130
structure but the structure is different

00:43:57,700 --> 00:44:03,099
as well so you need to map that content

00:44:00,130 --> 00:44:07,390
it's it's it's actually a sub project in

00:44:03,099 --> 00:44:10,650
itself really I'm not sure if that

00:44:07,390 --> 00:44:10,650
answers your question but

00:44:12,830 --> 00:44:20,880
right yeah but I'm happy to to think

00:44:18,510 --> 00:44:27,270
with you alive in the in the in the

00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:30,560
hallway later on if you will yeah one

00:44:27,270 --> 00:44:30,560
more yep

00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:04,980
so you can say

00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:36,069
well some of the keywords I don't know

00:45:33,069 --> 00:45:38,650
about that much really but it might be

00:45:36,069 --> 00:45:40,029
time to market so we have a platform

00:45:38,650 --> 00:45:42,069
that we can roll out a new

00:45:40,029 --> 00:45:46,150
functionalities real quick right with

00:45:42,069 --> 00:45:50,170
modules with content so you help those

00:45:46,150 --> 00:45:53,140
clients you know not just purchase like

00:45:50,170 --> 00:45:54,819
like expensive modules for expensive

00:45:53,140 --> 00:45:58,000
frameworks but it's actually out there

00:45:54,819 --> 00:46:00,760
as open source but you still need to pay

00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:02,619
like like you know good people who will

00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:06,279
implement it but you will be there quite

00:46:02,619 --> 00:46:10,059
fast that helps so obviously the lies

00:46:06,279 --> 00:46:14,829
the same costs right it's it's it's cost

00:46:10,059 --> 00:46:17,980
wise easier to step in what also helps

00:46:14,829 --> 00:46:22,510
is this there's the no vendor lock-in

00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:24,130
deal so especially well that's one of

00:46:22,510 --> 00:46:25,839
the things that I always say well if

00:46:24,130 --> 00:46:28,660
you're not happy i mean i'm not going to

00:46:25,839 --> 00:46:31,000
hold you there's no point in holding a

00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:33,789
relationship where either one of us is

00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:36,430
unhappy so if you want to leave that's

00:46:33,789 --> 00:46:38,500
fine obviously we do our best to have

00:46:36,430 --> 00:46:41,400
you stay but the vendor lock-in is a

00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:41,400
good buzz word for that

00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:48,550
yeah and I also I think it helps because

00:46:46,570 --> 00:46:50,920
because people will understand we're

00:46:48,550 --> 00:46:52,270
passionate about what we do that there's

00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:55,210
people at the table that are very

00:46:52,270 --> 00:46:57,030
passionate about their product but you

00:46:55,210 --> 00:46:59,650
also need to convince them that you're

00:46:57,030 --> 00:47:02,170
passionate about Drupal as you are about

00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:04,090
helping them achieve their goals online

00:47:02,170 --> 00:47:06,250
you know sell their stuff online and

00:47:04,090 --> 00:47:10,650
that know that you understand what needs

00:47:06,250 --> 00:47:10,650
to be done that's basically my message

00:47:11,010 --> 00:47:17,850
right yeah the why exactly I see that we

00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:22,510
still have fifteen minutes of the hour

00:47:17,850 --> 00:47:24,970
if there are still our questions yeah we

00:47:22,510 --> 00:47:30,330
need to go to lunch thank you for

00:47:24,970 --> 00:47:30,330
