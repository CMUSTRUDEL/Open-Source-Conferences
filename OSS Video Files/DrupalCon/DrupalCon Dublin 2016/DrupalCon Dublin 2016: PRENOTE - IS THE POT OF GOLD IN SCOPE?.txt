Title: DrupalCon Dublin 2016: PRENOTE - IS THE POT OF GOLD IN SCOPE?
Publication date: 2016-09-27
Playlist: DrupalCon Dublin 2016
Description: 
	Don't miss it! 8:00 on Tuesday! Get a good seat for Dries' keynote!

Coder and Themer are back! The Irish say there’s a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow, and Drupal’s dynamic duo are determined to find it. But trapping a leprechaun will take more than just good kung fu and code indents!

Come and help our intrepid heroes on their Irish adventure as they overcome obstacles, form new alliances, and travel to the very edge of scope (but not beyond!). Maybe you’ll even get a piece of that Leprechaun gold yourself!

"If you only get up early once during DrupalCon, this is the morning to do it. And hey, at least you'll get better seats for my keynote right after." - Dries
A DrupalCon institution, the opening "Prenote" has been getting people excited about DrupalCon since 2010. An infotainment extravaganza featuring Drupal community stars and friends; music and sing-a-longs; bad jokes; technical tutorials on Git, yodelling, use of the alphabet, and even proper beer pouring technique, what’s not to like? Especially eye-opening if you've never been to DrupalCon or never gotten up early enough to see one of these yet.

“Why do I always have to dress up as some kind of crustacean?!?” - Crell
Viewer discretion is advised. May contain geek humor, calls to contribute, singing, dancing, spandex, and questionable taste.

watching me know there's nothing

00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:51,520
well if we're going to catch a

00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:55,300
leprechaun we'll need a plan all right

00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:59,720
let's figure this out on a Gantt chart

00:09:55,300 --> 00:10:02,120
and with that the two mortal enemies

00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:05,120
pledged to help each other on this most

00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:06,590
vital of quests as they struggle to come

00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:09,730
up with a master plan to catch a

00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:13,820
leprechaun trouble was brewing on

00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:16,180
another part of the stage some people

00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:21,950
seem to bring trouble wherever they go

00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:25,910
enter the professionally offended really

00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:28,250
I mean it I'm so sorry I wasn't trying

00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:30,850
to be mean well it's too late for that

00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:33,530
now how could you even say something so

00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:36,110
insensitive it's an affront to me and

00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:38,540
everybody like me only I didn't mean it

00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:41,210
that way I was just don't don't say

00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:44,540
another word you only make it worse but

00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:47,690
I only asked if it was an iphone 7 you

00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:51,020
only asked if it was an iphone 7 only

00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:54,020
only asked just because I'm from a

00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:56,390
smaller Drupal job you assume that I'm

00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:58,940
stuck with the last year's model well

00:10:56,390 --> 00:11:01,460
I'm sorry we can't all work for America

00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:05,290
Corp and have the latest model some of

00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:09,620
us are strictly against adversity here

00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:18,680
oh don't cry I'm so sorry I didn't mean

00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:20,750
it that way this tissue is so thin what

00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:22,640
did you say about my tissue it's just so

00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:25,130
thin now this blew right through it and

00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:28,810
what blew right through it how can you

00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:31,760
say such a thing you're so insensitive

00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:36,470
just because I I came here by bicycle

00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:40,550

00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:41,420

offensive people are complicated and

00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:38,759
cultures and personalities can clash why

00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:40,949
most of the time you find it's just an

00:13:38,759 --> 00:13:43,620
accident by otherwise well-meaning

00:13:40,949 --> 00:13:46,740

00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:30,550
something this documentation is kind of

00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:32,140
confusing though that this is open

know in Erlang on rails we do it totally

00:15:38,650 --> 00:15:42,370
differently our maps are waiting ok get

00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:44,680
