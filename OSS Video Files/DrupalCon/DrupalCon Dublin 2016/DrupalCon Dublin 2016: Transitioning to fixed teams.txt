Title: DrupalCon Dublin 2016: Transitioning to fixed teams
Publication date: 2016-09-27
Playlist: DrupalCon Dublin 2016
Description: 
	In this session a SCRUM master, Evelien Schut, and a business owner, Mieszko Czyzyk, share the lessons learned from transitioning to multidisciplinary, fixed teams within the agency model.

These insights are based on our experience at GoalGorilla, a 25 people Drupal agency based in the Netherlands. They transitioned over a period of several months from a more traditional department structure working on ‘projects’ to a fixed team structure working for clients and building and maintaining products.

This talk is interesting for SCRUM masters and project managers looking for tips on common challenges such as:

organizing the roles of team members, for example product owners and other non-developers such as designers
managing agile sprints for different customers, with one team. 
time and billable rate reporting
facilitating a distributed team across timezones
For business owners this talk is interesting because it touches upon:

real world business metrics such as billable rates and turnover per full-time employee
a vision how this team structure supports a culture of shared responsibility, collaboration and professional excellence
a vision how this team structure supports a path for sustainable agency growth, with reduced risk 
The last 10 minutes are reserved for discussion on an aspect that proves to be especially challenging:

integrating sales into the teams instead, of more traditionally, account managers or directors

00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:09,900
our talk here today I hope you having a

00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:14,660
good time a triple crown up till now my

00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:16,980
name is misko i'm co-owner of go gorilla

00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:21,090
and i've been in the Drupal community

00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:26,330
for about eight years I'm a triple con

00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:26,330
speaker virgin so please be nice to me

00:00:26,449 --> 00:00:35,280
and my love for Drupal started slow so

00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,210
like like I said I've been running go

00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:40,739
gorilla for about eight nine years now

00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:43,350
but my background is more in industrial

00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:45,899
engineering and it's in analytics Google

00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:50,250
AdWords advertising so it's not so much

00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:52,320
about God like three sets today in his

00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:54,899
keynote so that so the love of code

00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,550
changes into the love of community and

00:00:54,899 --> 00:01:02,100
that what's happened to me but it took a

00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:03,960
while so from my background are more

00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:07,200
into advertising and the business side

00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:08,700
of things and that's also I I today i

00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:13,140
represent the business side of things

00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:18,150
when talking about fix things so i'll be

00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:20,100
talking abismo no perspective and David

00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:24,030
in here which you will introduce herself

00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:26,909
we'll be talking of from a scrum master

00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:30,420
perspective so I'll give the floor to

00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:33,659
you yeah alright so hi everybody I'm

00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:35,340
Evelyn and go grill our yes co was

00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:37,650
trying to hire me about three years ago

00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:41,150
and ever since then I'm also part of

00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:44,040
this huh at his big Drupal community and

00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:46,770
for most of our clients we work in an

00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:49,140
agile way in scrum methoden is an I

00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:52,259
active scrum master but we also do

00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:54,240
waterfall projects so I'm also some kind

00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:58,530
somehow the more traditional project

00:01:54,240 --> 00:02:00,049
manager for smaller projects and today

00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:03,180
we're going to talk about

00:02:00,049 --> 00:02:06,810
multidisciplinary teams how we

00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:10,020
implemented them and we're still

00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:12,270
actually implementing them and also what

00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:13,819
well especially with challenges we came

00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:16,249
across and we hope

00:02:13,819 --> 00:02:20,870
view some solutions to the problems we

00:02:16,249 --> 00:02:24,650
came across um but first let me take you

00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:29,239
back you're late may I have the clicker

00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:36,170
please yes so first let me take you back

00:02:29,239 --> 00:02:40,329
a year ago because in 2015 I think go

00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:43,400
gorilla exceeded about 20 employees and

00:02:40,329 --> 00:02:46,189
along with this growth a lot of other

00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:51,079
problems slowly arising and became

00:02:46,189 --> 00:02:53,480
bigger and these problems and mainly

00:02:51,079 --> 00:02:55,609
about planning so we have a lot of we

00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:59,090
had a lot of resources who were planned

00:02:55,609 --> 00:03:01,579
along among a lot of projects and which

00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:04,459
also let's to scatter to knowledge among

00:03:01,579 --> 00:03:05,930
all these people of these projects but

00:03:04,459 --> 00:03:09,169
also customers and a lot of different

00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:11,359
contact persons to talk to so that was

00:03:09,169 --> 00:03:14,449
also also not very entirely clear for

00:03:11,359 --> 00:03:19,489
our customers um and also if you look at

00:03:14,449 --> 00:03:22,009
the scrum way of managing a big part of

00:03:19,489 --> 00:03:24,650
scrum is to keep a dedicated team for

00:03:22,009 --> 00:03:25,790
longer periods of time and also this is

00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:30,439
something that we were not always

00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:31,729
following also we were still working in

00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:33,829
a more traditional ways of heaven

00:03:31,729 --> 00:03:35,659
departments like a design department and

00:03:33,829 --> 00:03:38,629
development departments and these

00:03:35,659 --> 00:03:41,780
department didn't really yeah cooperate

00:03:38,629 --> 00:03:43,790
and also they were like these single

00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:47,229
Island soon or in our company you know

00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:49,549
company basically so well at the end of

00:03:47,229 --> 00:03:52,879
2015 were like okay we have to solve

00:03:49,549 --> 00:03:54,229
these problems and how can we do that we

00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:57,079
had then had these promise when we were

00:03:54,229 --> 00:03:58,729
smaller so maybe we should try to become

00:03:57,079 --> 00:04:00,139
a little bit more smaller again and

00:03:58,729 --> 00:04:05,060
create sub teams where we have these

00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:07,280
this small Go gorillas and and this this

00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:10,400
is wedding multi-disciplinary teams came

00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:12,289
in this is not a new concept and I think

00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,060
over the last year's we also visited a

00:04:12,289 --> 00:04:16,849
lot of presentations and conferences

00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:18,769
about this topic and I think well and

00:04:16,849 --> 00:04:23,659
the end of last year this was the time

00:04:18,769 --> 00:04:25,340
for us to take the step and well we're

00:04:23,659 --> 00:04:27,510
currently not not there yet we're still

00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:30,060
I think we believe in 23

00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:32,100
of our implementation and we're heading

00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:35,460
towards having more than two

00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:38,400
multidisciplinary teams and also I am

00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:40,500
making the team's actual responsible for

00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:48,840
the revenue and their their seals

00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:50,430
basically yeah so just to give us a bit

00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:53,760
more context because that's what I

00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:55,590
should have said on the first line so so

00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:59,280
go girl has been growing like thirty

00:04:55,590 --> 00:05:01,830
forty percent a year for last 34 years

00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:04,050
so at first this is rather easily you

00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:08,040
know if you start with zero you it's

00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:09,900
easy to get to one and etc but at a

00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:14,130
certain moment especially around this 20

00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:18,030
20 people barrier it really started to

00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:19,740
hurt so we had like pretty heavy

00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:21,830
business reasons for doing this as well

00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:24,150
so it's not only about you know

00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:28,440
implementing a methodology that's that's

00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:30,540
rather hip like agile but we had a hard

00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:36,000
time staying profitable especially in

00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:37,560
2014 it was a rough year and I think in

00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,500
the end it's difficult to like grow

00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:43,710
quickly and also keep revenue up and and

00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:48,120
keep some money at the end and this was

00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:50,220
was really starting to worry us and as a

00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:52,230
side note i always had ambition to build

00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:56,250
something that's bigger than myself as

00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:58,500
well so so when we had this company with

00:05:56,250 --> 00:06:00,630
words like more traditionally structured

00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:02,640
in departments we had like a marketing

00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:06,720
department design department development

00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:09,210
support it always felt like you know you

00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,710
were at the top like the puppet master

00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:14,100
you had to manage all the strings at

00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:16,590
once and once you removed yourself you

00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:18,690
know it would stop moving and this did

00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:23,490
seem healthy to me doesn't feel right

00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:25,080
and also i think it neglects some of the

00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:27,600
talent in the company because people

00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:30,780
don't have the room to grow into their

00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:32,220
full potential so so they were like both

00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:34,260
emotional reasons and also like

00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:39,210
long-term version business reasons for

00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:40,830
triangles and doing this so you know

00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:43,410
this talk is a bit of a beginner

00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:45,450
doc I think at least that's what we

00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:49,440
promised but just to get a feel of the

00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:51,390
room let's do a show of hands so who is

00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:56,400
in a like project manager role or a

00:06:51,390 --> 00:07:00,000
scrum master role okay that's like one

00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:03,240
third of the room that's nice with the

00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,700
business owner okay wow so that's

00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:08,420
another one-third and what what

00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:13,340
represents the others coders any colors

00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:15,840
even call this game nice job guys and

00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:19,410
just just to give an indication because

00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:21,990
I think like company site is also a

00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:24,260
factor in this so so how many people are

00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:28,110
you like one to ten who is a one to 10

00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:35,460
business okay a bit less than like 14

00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:39,570
and then 10 to 15 yeah and 15 to 20 or

00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:42,360
more more wow it's quite a lot of you

00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:44,670
guys so you basically solved all our

00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:46,800
problems or maybe experienced and it

00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:49,350
later on we can talk about this later

00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:52,260
you know so so as a structure of our

00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:54,390
talk we have 20 or 50 minutes left at

00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:57,180
the end to get into more details

00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:59,130
depending on on how technical you guys

00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:03,630
want to get and if you want to talk to

00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:05,850
about tools and stuff like this mmm back

00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:08,850
back to this slide so why should this be

00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:10,950
interesting to you in my opinion I think

00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:13,320
we should have done this earlier it's

00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:16,830
always a very bad idea to reinvent the

00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:18,810
wheel again so if you do this in our

00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:21,150
experience you end up with a wheel that

00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:23,070
looks something like like this so it's

00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:28,740
not the most modern wheels will be

00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:30,780
crappy it will break so preferably if

00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:35,010
you can you would like to have something

00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:36,780
like this you know much better wheel but

00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:39,420
believe me they didn't do this by

00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:42,240
starting at zero no they iterated on the

00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:43,950
existing design and made it better so

00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,570
it's think I think especially for the

00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:48,779
like smaller companies it's good to

00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:54,209
start thinking about these issues

00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:56,160
early as possible so to sum up for scrum

00:08:54,209 --> 00:08:57,899
masters will be giving some suggestion

00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,910
how you do can you can do planning and

00:08:57,899 --> 00:09:03,360
accountability that's something we found

00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:05,850
this is important and for business

00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,410
owners I'll talk a bit about KPI so like

00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:10,920
key performance indicators how you

00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:14,610
measure your success very important and

00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:16,860
how you can use those tools to Bay to

00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:22,970
build a sustainable Drupal agency

00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:27,839
business in the longer term okay so um

00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:29,430
sure so we're going to touch on four

00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:31,470
challenges which we thought would be

00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:33,509
interesting you guys and the first one

00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:36,180
is the roles of team members how to

00:09:33,509 --> 00:09:39,899
organize them because it's not simply

00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:41,790
like like adding all these people in a

00:09:39,899 --> 00:09:44,579
team and that's it you also have to

00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:46,949
literally become multidisciplinary it's

00:09:44,579 --> 00:09:54,449
not just adding these disciplines and a

00:09:46,949 --> 00:09:57,750
team so what we did is approach it agile

00:09:54,449 --> 00:09:59,670
like we always do so we started to

00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:01,949
implementing it step by step so we could

00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:04,350
also learn of each step and the depth if

00:10:01,949 --> 00:10:06,449
needed to the next step and so this is a

00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:08,639
go gorilla and what we first did our

00:10:06,449 --> 00:10:12,000
first step was basically create two

00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:13,740
teams and each team consists of our

00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,839
developers or from tenders and our

00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:20,040
project managers so we split them up as

00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:22,079
as first step and what we tried for a

00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:23,399
couple of months is how to count the

00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:25,920
developers in front ender's would

00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:27,480
collaborate in a smaller team exchanging

00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:31,170
their knowledge and also learn how to

00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:32,879
benefit from each other and the project

00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:36,149
manager starts to experiment a little

00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:39,929
bit on the reporting how do we show how

00:10:36,149 --> 00:10:44,269
billable we are and how do we show how

00:10:39,929 --> 00:10:47,160
much capacity we still have available so

00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:49,079
next step for us must to add the

00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:51,420
designers so we have interaction

00:10:49,079 --> 00:10:53,939
designers and graphical designers we

00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:58,769
also splitted them and added them each

00:10:53,939 --> 00:11:01,500
to a team and yeah again we started to

00:10:58,769 --> 00:11:03,180
to learn how to collaborate with even a

00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:08,970
discipline was even farther from your

00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:11,990
normal daily job so they were as a code

00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:14,550
and also yeah as a project manager and

00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:16,830
so there was already something we have

00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:21,810
to learn and we started doing this for

00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:24,900
two months and also started to learn how

00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:26,670
to collaborate between the teams because

00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:29,760
it's not that we don't want to have any

00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:31,020
collaboration anymore whatsoever we

00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:34,890
still have to spread knowledge between

00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:37,730
these two teams so we have set up some

00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:39,810
several events where these teams

00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:44,360
cooperate with each other exchange

00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:47,220
knowledge and all kinds of things um

00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:50,540
well next step would be to add marketing

00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:53,490
to the teams and we're actually right in

00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:55,430
front of this article at the beginning

00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:59,250
of this step so we're not there yet and

00:11:55,430 --> 00:12:02,100
marketing can already has used part in

00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:04,800
our customer projects but we also expect

00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:07,560
that the marketing can help the team to

00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:09,480
promote itself which can also be very

00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:12,210
beneficial if if go gorilla wants to

00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:13,470
hire new developers new designers so

00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:16,170
then we're actually out there and

00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:18,120
telling how cool we are what we do and

00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:22,820
what kind of team we are and I think

00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:26,900
that would also be a very beneficial um

00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:31,050
well next and maybe the last step step

00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:33,690
is to add sales or sales activities to

00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:36,570
the team so we're not quite sure what

00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:41,040
this should be but in the end we're

00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:43,890
hoping to ya to go towards this figure

00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:45,690
and to see or actually to give the

00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:48,300
responsibility through the team in terms

00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:51,660
of revenue sales and all these things so

00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:54,150
but we're not there yet I think we hope

00:12:51,660 --> 00:13:01,950
to take a step in this in the beginning

00:12:54,150 --> 00:13:04,320
of 2017 um so for us it was really

00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:07,490
helpful to take it step by step up till

00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:10,350
now and I think the biggest the biggest

00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:12,270
thing for us was learning at the

00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:14,800
collaboration between these team members

00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:17,389
it is not high

00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:19,759
just from split second you have to

00:13:17,389 --> 00:13:22,910
really invest in it you have to learn

00:13:19,759 --> 00:13:24,560
what can benefit another team member so

00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:34,130
this is really where we pay the most

00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:35,569
attention to in the past month so and

00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:38,269
I've been looking at it like a more

00:13:35,569 --> 00:13:43,759
company-wide situation so if you take

00:13:38,269 --> 00:13:45,259
like 2014 and 2015 I already told you we

00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:49,370
had this department so we were like

00:13:45,259 --> 00:13:52,240
pretty traditionally structured with the

00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:55,850
end result being that almost all

00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:57,290
accountability was right at the top if

00:13:55,850 --> 00:14:01,519
you really looked at it they were like

00:13:57,290 --> 00:14:04,100
no reporting mechanisms for four people

00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:05,899
working in a department or at least

00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:07,850
maybe there were some reporting

00:14:05,899 --> 00:14:11,149
mechanism but they will not know real

00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:18,440
consequences when when things go not how

00:14:11,149 --> 00:14:21,199
we plant them so decided yeah this

00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:22,790
disaffected basically all the

00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:25,370
responsibilities where that was at the

00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:27,560
management level and and we everybody

00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:29,509
behaves accordingly because you know

00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:31,430
that that's what would what you the

00:14:29,509 --> 00:14:34,670
structure supports so we had like

00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:36,740
quarterly reviews with the company but

00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:41,839
we didn't really share financial

00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:44,089
information as management so we were not

00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:47,720
really keep you eye focused in that way

00:14:44,089 --> 00:14:49,009
so it was really easy for people to and

00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,509
I understand that you know I'm not

00:14:49,009 --> 00:14:53,149
blaming people it's like the logical

00:14:50,509 --> 00:14:55,490
consequence that there were beginnings

00:14:53,149 --> 00:14:59,689
of not my problem culture like I would

00:14:55,490 --> 00:15:01,339
like it we could say so so people who

00:14:59,689 --> 00:15:03,769
are just thinking well somebody else

00:15:01,339 --> 00:15:06,380
will fall to solve this issue and in the

00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:08,600
end the bill somewhere ends up at at

00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:12,019
those guys at the top and we'll see what

00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:14,089
happens and basically that's that's my

00:15:12,019 --> 00:15:15,680
fault you know for structuring it this

00:15:14,089 --> 00:15:18,069
way so I don't blame people again I

00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:20,930
don't think it was a terrible company to

00:15:18,069 --> 00:15:23,779
work at or that weird is that disastrous

00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:26,449
buses but you just end up in a situation

00:15:23,779 --> 00:15:30,169
that works like this and I think

00:15:26,449 --> 00:15:32,720
it's important to to if you can prevent

00:15:30,169 --> 00:15:34,459
this and be ahead of this bye-bye doing

00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:40,579
it differently that's that's basically

00:15:34,459 --> 00:15:43,040
the story here so now when we have these

00:15:40,579 --> 00:15:46,220
two we have two teams who have Ferguson

00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:51,139
forming there's much more responsibility

00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:54,589
within the tea and we have a few key

00:15:51,139 --> 00:15:56,509
ways in doing this and I think this is

00:15:54,589 --> 00:15:58,279
something I would if you if you take

00:15:56,509 --> 00:16:03,529
away anything today that would be nice

00:15:58,279 --> 00:16:05,720
to think about this so so we use I think

00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:09,649
you can call it the all hands meeting is

00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:11,959
which is every six weeks and every team

00:16:09,649 --> 00:16:16,399
is now responsible for presenting its

00:16:11,959 --> 00:16:20,660
key is and our basic TBI is billable

00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:22,579
rate so so we the teams report on their

00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:24,139
efficiencies instead we used to be

00:16:22,579 --> 00:16:26,569
burned like a revenue focused company

00:16:24,139 --> 00:16:30,109
but that doesn't really tell you much

00:16:26,569 --> 00:16:32,359
about profitability at the end in arm in

00:16:30,109 --> 00:16:35,600
my vision it's more important to focus

00:16:32,359 --> 00:16:37,910
on billable rates if I mean we'll go

00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,769
more into detail about how high this

00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:48,859
rate should be or what what is the

00:16:39,769 --> 00:16:51,379
consequence of this so let me see and so

00:16:48,859 --> 00:16:53,749
yeah so miss this all hands meeting its

00:16:51,379 --> 00:16:55,999
bit getting more popular that you hear

00:16:53,749 --> 00:16:58,429
about this as many companies but I

00:16:55,999 --> 00:17:00,499
really feel the key difference is that

00:16:58,429 --> 00:17:04,429
not the management is reporting like

00:17:00,499 --> 00:17:05,899
afterwards about those key performance

00:17:04,429 --> 00:17:08,689
indicators but the teams do it

00:17:05,899 --> 00:17:10,850
themselves you know and when you end up

00:17:08,689 --> 00:17:14,689
with a much more transparent business as

00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:16,850
a whole because now nobody can say well

00:17:14,689 --> 00:17:19,039
I did not my problem I didn't know and

00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:21,069
you have like once a year a discussion

00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:23,659
about the financials now you'll see

00:17:21,069 --> 00:17:30,800
potential pitfalls or any issues much

00:17:23,659 --> 00:17:34,980
much earlier yeah

00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:37,470
okay challenge two is about managing

00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:42,570
several agile projects within a smaller

00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:45,000
team because well when you have a

00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:47,130
smaller team it's you also bit less

00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,260
flexible than we were before like a

00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:50,700
project was there and we said okay this

00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:53,100
guy has some time these guys some time

00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:55,680
will ya squeeze them together and here

00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:58,470
is the project team but now we have to

00:17:55,680 --> 00:18:00,870
fit it in these smaller teams so that is

00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:04,170
also a challenge and what you try to do

00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:07,200
is sell Sprint's to customer customers

00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:09,000
and try just to schedule them one at a

00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:11,610
time oh yeah keep forgetting this sorry

00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:14,280
so and scatter them one at a time and

00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:16,740
what we do is we communicate to two

00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:20,040
sales basically what is our available

00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:21,930
capacity and what kind of project would

00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:24,480
fit in there and of course you cannot

00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:28,250
steer this but this is something we try

00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:30,510
to to to to inform sales about with it

00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:33,390
doesn't need to be a more development

00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:36,210
focused assignment or should it be more

00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:38,820
design a focus so this is also something

00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:42,330
we try to communicate to sale so that

00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:43,830
they can actually find the correct or

00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:46,680
actually the right project which you'll

00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:49,350
fit in the team and sometimes we also

00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:52,710
have to do a smaller waterfall projects

00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:54,690
and what we try to do is well schedule

00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:58,740
an extra iteration in between sprints

00:18:54,690 --> 00:19:01,470
and just squeeze as much as fits in

00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:03,750
there so we can have this a bit more

00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:05,550
structured instead of that it flows

00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:08,010
through our Springs and that is more

00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:11,010
parallel so we try to avoid working

00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:13,770
parallel because we're still one team so

00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:17,540
we have to yeah also work as a team and

00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:17,540
focus on the same goals as a team

00:19:21,669 --> 00:19:28,879
yeah then the fun starts because when I

00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:32,629
see this and I think well we have these

00:19:28,879 --> 00:19:36,259
empty spaces it's like two teams and I

00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:39,320
have this very nice three week project

00:19:36,259 --> 00:19:42,019
which I could potentially do in one

00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:46,580
sprint then i will just squeeze it in

00:19:42,019 --> 00:19:49,219
there like over t1 and t2 I'll just push

00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:53,599
it in there and like make money that's

00:19:49,219 --> 00:19:56,089
nice right and we used to do this a lot

00:19:53,599 --> 00:19:59,330
you know even that book at the beginning

00:19:56,089 --> 00:20:02,089
of the of the of the teams as well but

00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:05,239
even more before when we just had

00:20:02,089 --> 00:20:09,259
individual members everywhere and this

00:20:05,239 --> 00:20:13,089
almost always bandits not well maybe not

00:20:09,259 --> 00:20:16,059
a disaster but it was it was not pretty

00:20:13,089 --> 00:20:18,409
the results were like project overrun

00:20:16,059 --> 00:20:22,219
lower quality deliveries then you

00:20:18,409 --> 00:20:23,960
actually would like but maybe most

00:20:22,219 --> 00:20:26,479
important when you'd like deliver this

00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:28,009
this project there is again you Rebecca

00:20:26,479 --> 00:20:29,599
this situation that there is no real

00:20:28,009 --> 00:20:31,879
responsibility so because a few

00:20:29,599 --> 00:20:34,759
individual made it nobody was really

00:20:31,879 --> 00:20:36,409
hands-on for for the end result and then

00:20:34,759 --> 00:20:38,299
it's really hard to follow up with a

00:20:36,409 --> 00:20:39,979
customer with something is wrong or you

00:20:38,299 --> 00:20:43,489
want to make litter a shin or a next

00:20:39,979 --> 00:20:46,219
version so my biggest tip is how big the

00:20:43,489 --> 00:20:49,249
temptation gets just don't do it you

00:20:46,219 --> 00:20:52,519
know just don't start squeezing in stuff

00:20:49,249 --> 00:20:54,349
across teams projects across teams

00:20:52,519 --> 00:20:58,549
because there are better ways of doing

00:20:54,349 --> 00:21:03,549
this so so if you come up with this type

00:20:58,549 --> 00:21:06,109
of situation consider like either

00:21:03,549 --> 00:21:08,359
extending team and by this we mean like

00:21:06,109 --> 00:21:10,460
hiring new people but this might be

00:21:08,359 --> 00:21:13,729
dangerous if you don't want to commit

00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:16,059
for a long long long term I would

00:21:13,729 --> 00:21:19,009
actually recommend looking into

00:21:16,059 --> 00:21:20,779
acquiring like a partner Drupal agency

00:21:19,009 --> 00:21:24,589
that works for us it works really well

00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:26,659
you could look into nearshoring it for

00:21:24,589 --> 00:21:28,309
example and the reason why I prefer

00:21:26,659 --> 00:21:30,499
working with agencies instead of

00:21:28,309 --> 00:21:31,570
freelancers is even a bit more stable

00:21:30,499 --> 00:21:33,940
you know if

00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:36,940
agency has a few bit more resources

00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:39,640
available and you will not end up with a

00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:40,930
freelancer which disappears or it's busy

00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:44,440
on a different project when you need

00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:50,230
them the next time so instead of like

00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:54,220
trying to squeeze stuff in horizontally

00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:56,290
or vertically in this in this case right

00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:57,460
right thinking about expanding or maybe

00:21:56,290 --> 00:22:00,520
we'll do something like flexible

00:21:57,460 --> 00:22:01,870
expansion of your team's it tends to to

00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:04,120
work much better than the team just

00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:06,880
absorbs the new team member if it's a

00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:11,800
few people without much pain in our

00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:17,980
experience alright third challenge is

00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:21,580
about reporting and as music and musical

00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:23,410
kind of already introduced we are at the

00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:26,680
moment really focusing on our billable

00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:29,350
rate and we also set a target for this /

00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:32,760
team on next exit every team has the

00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:35,200
same target so what we do is we say

00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:39,160
seventy-five percent over time we should

00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:45,070
be available and twenty-five percent we

00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:47,530
can spend on yea grow a spent on

00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:49,600
personal growth and we can either do

00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:52,660
this in a personal level but you can

00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:54,490
also look at us as a team if you want to

00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:57,280
visit a conference or if you want to

00:22:54,490 --> 00:23:00,220
learn some specific thing in intercourse

00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:04,660
or those kind of things so we call it of

00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:06,370
course rd but the 75 percent since we

00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:08,770
also told that the teams are not

00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:11,770
responsible yet for their revenue and

00:23:08,770 --> 00:23:13,660
their sales we like to keep this figure

00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:16,420
because it really focuses team and to

00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:17,830
get used to these targets but also is

00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:20,250
the most important thing is that which

00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:23,440
that we learn to be more efficient and

00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:25,930
especially in Ingo guerrilla our

00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:28,420
projects are I think the majority of our

00:23:25,930 --> 00:23:31,660
projects are heavily development based

00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:36,940
so once in a while our designers have

00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:39,250
less tasks to do and by adding them in

00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:41,080
these themes as well we are now making

00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:43,780
sure that the entire team is responsible

00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:45,580
also for this designer that he has work

00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:48,100
to do so they are looking for

00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:50,380
new things and they are being creative

00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:54,160
in a different way what work and I help

00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:56,920
with what will benefit and what will

00:23:54,160 --> 00:24:00,580
benefit if I help around in this team

00:23:56,920 --> 00:24:02,890
and explore tasks beyond at the border

00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:07,150
of you of your normal daily jobs so

00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:09,040
think of helping testing or create some

00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:10,870
documentation or help out with a

00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:13,480
customer because they had a lot of

00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:15,480
questions those kind of things so it's

00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:18,040
really paying off to see that people are

00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:21,780
ya helping each other and making sure

00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:21,780
everybody has enough work to do

00:24:29,290 --> 00:24:39,340
so I told you about our like six weekly

00:24:36,730 --> 00:24:41,530
company meetings so so I told you it was

00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:45,250
really important to rotate this take

00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:47,410
this home so I'll emphasize again and we

00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:48,910
do really do strict reporting on

00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:50,830
billable rates in those weeks and

00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:53,080
actually sometimes we are a lot of buff

00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:56,590
those billable rates but we know what is

00:24:53,080 --> 00:25:00,550
a healthy like down-down level which is

00:24:56,590 --> 00:25:03,700
at 75 maybe you can explain it lean why

00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:07,960
we're above a hundred but that's maybe

00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:09,700
discussion for a different time but you

00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:11,320
know there's a few things we still need

00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:13,150
to learn and I think if you start

00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:14,590
looking into this type of structure you

00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:17,800
should look into them as quickly as

00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:19,750
possible and that's also looking ahead

00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:23,170
because we are approaching this a bit

00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:26,320
like a accountancy based system you know

00:25:23,170 --> 00:25:28,930
so you look only in the past which is

00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:32,110
all nice it's better than doing nothing

00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:34,360
certainly but it gets interesting when

00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:37,090
you can predict this to a certain point

00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:39,520
and look ahead so if you see problems

00:25:37,090 --> 00:25:41,800
when you build ability will drop to

00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:43,390
unhealthy levels or if you are just too

00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:47,500
busy so you just cannot do any more

00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:51,490
projects and this still has proven a bit

00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:53,350
hard for us to look ahead and this is

00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:55,450
the next step we were working on so not

00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:58,150
only reporting back but having some kind

00:25:55,450 --> 00:26:02,500
of way of predicting this like two or

00:25:58,150 --> 00:26:05,170
three months ahead and then you know

00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:06,850
what's important to tell in terms of

00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:08,770
results because i was telling that this

00:26:06,850 --> 00:26:14,530
is about building a sustainable business

00:26:08,770 --> 00:26:18,730
in the end at least it's for me so so in

00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:22,630
2015 we we did about 85,000 zeros of

00:26:18,730 --> 00:26:26,470
revenue on per full-time employee and we

00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:30,040
were like with 18 people so that's close

00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:32,950
to 100 thousand dollars that that's okay

00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:35,500
i think it could be higher you know if

00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:38,740
we are pretty young team if you if you

00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:40,690
if you have want to have room for growth

00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:41,750
with it should be a bit higher even

00:26:40,690 --> 00:26:43,400
still

00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:45,860
and now when we look after we

00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:47,270
implemented this our situation is a bit

00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:49,100
different this year because we are

00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:51,620
investing heavily in a distribution as

00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:54,230
well but if you count those hours as

00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:56,510
billable I think we see about that we

00:26:54,230 --> 00:27:00,020
are about five more percent more

00:26:56,510 --> 00:27:02,930
efficient and growing like twenty

00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:05,150
percent in our team size so so that's

00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:06,950
like breed in my opinions pretty good

00:27:05,150 --> 00:27:09,980
results because we had always trouble

00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:11,810
keeping up growth and sustaining

00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:16,310
profitability now we actually increased

00:27:11,810 --> 00:27:21,440
both so so it from what we can account

00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:24,790
for now it does work so I really

00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:27,470
recommend it and just let us a final

00:27:24,790 --> 00:27:30,860
remark you know I don't seems like I'm

00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:33,710
only in it for the money but in my

00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:35,150
belief those billable rates are also

00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:36,650
important because it says something

00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:38,210
about those twenty percent or

00:27:36,650 --> 00:27:41,420
twenty-five percent in which you don't

00:27:38,210 --> 00:27:44,750
need to be billable so it in the end it

00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:49,070
drives innovation as well you know just

00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:51,350
working for clients or 24 7 who will not

00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:55,910
always yield the best results in the

00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:57,830
long long run so I think it's important

00:27:55,910 --> 00:28:02,060
to think about how much time you want to

00:27:57,830 --> 00:28:05,660
spend on innovating your company and for

00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:07,790
us this seems to be healthy levels I

00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:10,400
know about levels which are a bit

00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:14,450
different so I know agencies that press

00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:16,100
our box up to 85 or even higher when

00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:18,680
they work on like full-time agile

00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:22,610
projects but this seems to work for us

00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:23,570
for now and seeing sustainable oh I I

00:28:22,610 --> 00:28:27,410
didn't mention that we are actually

00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:31,370
achieved 12% profitability in 2015 on

00:28:27,410 --> 00:28:34,520
this important thing on this eighty-five

00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:37,520
thousand euro revenue so this is a

00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:39,200
healthy business but I think as the

00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:43,190
owner you should keep those metrics in

00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:46,360
mind and see if you can come up with

00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:46,360
something that works long term

00:28:48,179 --> 00:29:00,149
oh yes yes look into different yeah okay

00:28:54,950 --> 00:29:03,059
dr. Greene yeah so the fourth and last

00:29:00,149 --> 00:29:05,789
challenge is its growth I think we have

00:29:03,059 --> 00:29:07,769
mentioned it a couple of times because

00:29:05,789 --> 00:29:09,929
when at the beginning of the year we

00:29:07,769 --> 00:29:11,340
said hey you have you all have

00:29:09,929 --> 00:29:13,169
twenty-five percent of your time which

00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:17,610
you can dedicate on personal growth or

00:29:13,169 --> 00:29:19,700
team growth well people were like okay

00:29:17,610 --> 00:29:22,499
what should i do and there are not many

00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:25,679
ways or they were not very creative in

00:29:22,499 --> 00:29:29,340
these things so one thing we came up

00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:31,049
with and is how we call it our developer

00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:34,249
journey and you can also call it design

00:29:31,049 --> 00:29:36,929
a journey of course but twice a year and

00:29:34,249 --> 00:29:38,909
developer in this case sits down with a

00:29:36,929 --> 00:29:42,090
few of his team members and and just

00:29:38,909 --> 00:29:44,759
discussed a lot of technical skills but

00:29:42,090 --> 00:29:47,369
also soft skills and and they discuss

00:29:44,759 --> 00:29:50,519
whether these skills already performed

00:29:47,369 --> 00:29:53,309
at a at a more junior level or a more

00:29:50,519 --> 00:29:55,080
senior level and level and yeah we have

00:29:53,309 --> 00:29:58,559
some terms for that on the right you see

00:29:55,080 --> 00:30:02,639
infant and silver back and growing but

00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:04,950
it's just a major thing and based on

00:30:02,639 --> 00:30:08,039
these on these on his feedback from his

00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:10,889
team members this person can set like a

00:30:08,039 --> 00:30:13,350
plan in which he wants to focus on the

00:30:10,889 --> 00:30:15,509
coming six to twelve months in this

00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:20,249
twenty percent twenty-five percent of

00:30:15,509 --> 00:30:22,200
his time well and as I said he can do it

00:30:20,249 --> 00:30:24,360
on a personal level so he can just

00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:27,389
follow his own path and and make sure

00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:28,980
that he learns a lot and if he wants he

00:30:27,389 --> 00:30:31,379
can share it with his team but what

00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:35,669
we're actually seeing now is that people

00:30:31,379 --> 00:30:37,200
are trying to to cooperate with other

00:30:35,669 --> 00:30:39,809
colleagues who have the same interest

00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:42,509
and are interested in the same focus

00:30:39,809 --> 00:30:43,830
areas so we have some small groups of

00:30:42,509 --> 00:30:47,070
people who are very interested in

00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:49,499
security or performance and they just

00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:52,080
scheduled our own time and make sure

00:30:49,499 --> 00:30:54,600
that they set some goals or learn new

00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:57,960
things and all kinds of things in these

00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:59,850
focus areas and the nicest thing is of

00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:00,190
course also that they can even spread

00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:09,279
this

00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:11,649
new knowledge in their teams yeah this

00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:13,240
this last one is I think also

00:31:11,649 --> 00:31:18,250
interesting because this really touches

00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:20,169
upon like a long-term vision because I

00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:22,600
think which is important to align

00:31:20,169 --> 00:31:24,610
personal growth with like collective

00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:28,509
success of the company if you somehow

00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:32,590
manage to do this you will be doing well

00:31:28,509 --> 00:31:35,110
in a long time a long term and but this

00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:40,570
this might be harder than then it looks

00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:42,700
because yet so we have two things you

00:31:40,570 --> 00:31:44,769
know so we have like Sara Lee's salary

00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:48,129
so most people like to learn more when

00:31:44,769 --> 00:31:53,860
they look more experienced and they

00:31:48,129 --> 00:31:56,409
write right for it but this doesn't

00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:58,720
always align with making more revenue

00:31:56,409 --> 00:32:02,159
especially what we have seen this is

00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:05,230
something we could talk about once we're

00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:07,120
at the end of this session is for

00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:10,659
instance we used to charge like jr.

00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:13,690
meteor and senior rates for people to

00:32:10,659 --> 00:32:16,029
our clients and then if you do that it's

00:32:13,690 --> 00:32:18,100
possible to align more experienced

00:32:16,029 --> 00:32:21,129
people with with actually making more

00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:23,649
money so then they can get more

00:32:21,129 --> 00:32:25,990
experience that you can charge more etc

00:32:23,649 --> 00:32:31,090
but in our experience the market is

00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:34,330
changing a bit and people tend to like

00:32:31,090 --> 00:32:35,529
flat rates at least in our business in

00:32:34,330 --> 00:32:39,039
the Netherlands and some of our

00:32:35,529 --> 00:32:41,169
international clients so what happens

00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:43,509
then that this no longer aligned so if

00:32:41,169 --> 00:32:45,820
you charge like flat rate and everybody

00:32:43,509 --> 00:32:49,690
is moving in those journeys to like

00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:52,240
higher senior level salaries then you in

00:32:49,690 --> 00:32:55,120
the end it will not compute you know so

00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:57,580
so you will start the better you are at

00:32:55,120 --> 00:33:01,210
your work the relatively less

00:32:57,580 --> 00:33:03,789
profitability you will achieve so so

00:33:01,210 --> 00:33:05,919
this is something we really need to

00:33:03,789 --> 00:33:09,250
think about and our answer is actually

00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:09,850
we decided to implement one flat rate so

00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:11,470
there are not

00:33:09,850 --> 00:33:16,990
no differences because nobody wants to

00:33:11,470 --> 00:33:18,429
hire like a junior person but we do have

00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:21,309
a like a pretty aggressive growth

00:33:18,429 --> 00:33:24,309
strategy so so our answer for aligning

00:33:21,309 --> 00:33:26,770
those two is to keep on expanding those

00:33:24,309 --> 00:33:28,450
teams you know so so the more

00:33:26,770 --> 00:33:31,450
experienced people break off they

00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:35,830
potentially can form new teams and your

00:33:31,450 --> 00:33:37,870
feet the teams with with new people and

00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:39,580
this is interesting because it my way

00:33:37,870 --> 00:33:44,650
did in my vision this is the only way to

00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:46,809
actually do this but you do have a you

00:33:44,650 --> 00:33:48,909
cannot implement this system and just

00:33:46,809 --> 00:33:50,770
say well we'll just stay at 10 or 15

00:33:48,909 --> 00:33:53,710
people I think it will it will not work

00:33:50,770 --> 00:33:57,970
in the end so if you move to this the

00:33:53,710 --> 00:34:00,909
team structure be prepared to to look

00:33:57,970 --> 00:34:03,610
for growth you know and our pace was

00:34:00,909 --> 00:34:07,000
about twenty to thirty five percent a

00:34:03,610 --> 00:34:12,580
year I guess it's interesting if this is

00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:17,919
a sustainable rate it seems so but but

00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:21,639
keep this in mind um so we're at the end

00:34:17,919 --> 00:34:26,409
of our talk let me summarize you the key

00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:30,580
takeaways we have for you so if you're

00:34:26,409 --> 00:34:33,100
interested in this type of structure for

00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:36,790
your company think thinking teams not

00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:42,010
layers of management and and departments

00:34:36,790 --> 00:34:44,080
like we used to have in 2014 so if you

00:34:42,010 --> 00:34:46,270
have capacity issues like like I showed

00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:48,060
you like trying to squeeze in projects

00:34:46,270 --> 00:34:51,490
across teams which is really unhealthy

00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:53,379
don't don't do it consider expanding

00:34:51,490 --> 00:34:57,340
your team's either temporarily in my

00:34:53,379 --> 00:34:59,820
hiring freelancers or maybe settings up

00:34:57,340 --> 00:35:02,830
some more sustainable agency

00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:07,570
corporations with other do pro agencies

00:35:02,830 --> 00:35:10,900
oh I think it's really critical to our

00:35:07,570 --> 00:35:12,580
success in a way those six if it doesn't

00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:15,250
matter if it's six weeks or eight or

00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:18,089
whatever but these all all hand hands

00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:20,859
long meetings in which you discuss

00:35:18,089 --> 00:35:21,840
important performance indicators it for

00:35:20,859 --> 00:35:26,550
us it's billable

00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:29,250
makes sense a lot I think and last but

00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:30,990
not least think about how we will align

00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:33,750
personal growth and like professional

00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:35,550
growth of people with growth of your

00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:37,590
company in revenue because those not

00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:46,590
always align and then we will run into

00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:50,070
problems in the longer term so I think

00:35:46,590 --> 00:35:52,800
we're good on time so we have quite a

00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:54,690
lot of time for discussion I I have like

00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:57,960
one first question you prepared for you

00:35:54,690 --> 00:36:02,070
guys if you are a bit shot and then we

00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:04,050
can maybe expand and just talk about all

00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:10,200
kinds of things you you think it's

00:36:04,050 --> 00:36:12,600
interesting so just to just to start one

00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:17,460
of us things we haven't solved yet is

00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:19,650
about a question about sales so maybe

00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:21,750
somebody wants to tell about how how he

00:36:19,650 --> 00:36:26,060
or she integrated sales into their

00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:28,800
organization in a team like structure

00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:32,880
because we don't really sure how to do

00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:45,660
this yet so anyone I see a bunch of

00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:50,640
people shaking their heads like no sorry

00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:55,470
maybe you could you yeah thank you so

00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:58,410
much I'm sorry I'm Eric I I might have a

00:36:55,470 --> 00:37:01,680
clue on how to address these kinds of

00:36:58,410 --> 00:37:06,120
topics because many of them are related

00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:08,220
to not be functional role of team

00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:12,300
members I'm a designer or I'm a

00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:18,300
developer or whatever but more in terms

00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:20,520
of people roles their theory for example

00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:24,090
theme role models from from regime

00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:26,000
Blanchard that discusses on what kind of

00:37:24,090 --> 00:37:27,920
people are in a team

00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:31,100
or should be in a team to have a

00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:33,620
successful theme for example you need

00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:35,480
plants that people that come up with

00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:37,760
ideas all the time and you but you also

00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:40,850
need bureaucrats that write them down or

00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:48,440
these objectives or things like that so

00:37:40,850 --> 00:37:52,760
maybe if you look at more people skills

00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:56,470
within your team that might be helpful

00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:58,820
to address sales as well because maybe

00:37:56,470 --> 00:38:01,370
your developer might be a good

00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:03,680
salesperson at least for some clients or

00:38:01,370 --> 00:38:06,410
some projects it doesn't need to be a

00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:08,600
different person yeah so it's an

00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:10,280
interesting point so if I understand

00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:14,480
correctly you say it's also about the

00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:19,360
soft skills and maybe somebody could

00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:21,920
develop these roles within their main

00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:26,090
role as a developer or designer or

00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:27,650
whatever but still then then you know

00:38:26,090 --> 00:38:29,780
you have to have revenue and sales

00:38:27,650 --> 00:38:33,380
because in the end if you don't the team

00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:37,250
will fall apart so I think the keys were

00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:45,170
the responsibility lies you know so I

00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:49,190
have somebody at the front I think that

00:38:45,170 --> 00:38:53,300
it's it's very hot and it's all on the

00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:56,630
management in the beginning to to make

00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:58,660
sure that if you put the sales persons

00:38:56,630 --> 00:39:02,440
into the team's that's a very good idea

00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:05,840
but not to give them too many hats

00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:08,510
because it becomes a problem when you

00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:13,250
have a sales person who's also involved

00:39:08,510 --> 00:39:14,870
in the process of producing and and he

00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:16,570
won't be able to focus on selling the

00:39:14,870 --> 00:39:20,690
next project which is why I don't

00:39:16,570 --> 00:39:22,940
actually agree that that to develop the

00:39:20,690 --> 00:39:25,160
team members into sales persons would be

00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:28,940
a very good idea but on the other hand

00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:32,780
by placing the sales person into the

00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:35,270
team he can take on some what of a

00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:36,590
product owner row and become more

00:39:35,270 --> 00:39:40,640
technical

00:39:36,590 --> 00:39:44,860
and and as a technical product manager

00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:49,910
which I am now and previously I was

00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:52,280
sales account manager and and my problem

00:39:49,910 --> 00:39:54,020
when I was a salesman and not integrated

00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:56,330
in the team was that I didn't have the

00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:58,250
technical understanding that I really

00:39:56,330 --> 00:40:02,620
needed to understand what had to be done

00:39:58,250 --> 00:40:06,140
when I sold stuff and now that I'm more

00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:08,870
involved in the process it's easier for

00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:10,880
me but then I lose track of the sales

00:40:08,870 --> 00:40:13,670
stuff because I have to make sprint

00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:16,690
reports and manage the next week's print

00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:19,910
because i keep getting more hats so it's

00:40:16,690 --> 00:40:21,980
it's kind of like okay now you can do

00:40:19,910 --> 00:40:24,440
more stuff you don't have to do more

00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:29,750
stuff but it's nice that you know that

00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:31,880
stuff exists that's it's hard it wasn't

00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:35,000
really solution or in what I had to see

00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:36,890
here was more problem oriented but now

00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:39,310
when I gave his really good idea to

00:40:36,890 --> 00:40:44,270
integrate sails into the team's because

00:40:39,310 --> 00:40:47,810
then how I keep talking but we all it's

00:40:44,270 --> 00:40:50,060
often it becomes us versus them when

00:40:47,810 --> 00:40:52,910
it's the developers versus the sales

00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:56,090
teams because sales teams don't have the

00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:58,640
understanding of what it's like to be

00:40:56,090 --> 00:41:01,730
the developer yeah they think well this

00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:06,020
sounds easy it's only a bit of code we

00:41:01,730 --> 00:41:08,420
can do that tomorrow no problem yeah so

00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:10,580
that's interesting points at all but

00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:12,770
your point is basically opposite to what

00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:15,920
we heard that at first there are like

00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:20,300
lots of fingers at the end of the room

00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:23,000
yes yes I so I'm here I'm responsible

00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:24,890
for sales and marketing and partnerships

00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:28,190
at an agency could manifest oh I

00:41:24,890 --> 00:41:31,310
completely agree with your point so I

00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:33,620
joined the agency when there was 18 of

00:41:31,310 --> 00:41:36,950
us about a year and a half ago there's

00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:39,800
now 40 so we've grown pretty rapidly and

00:41:36,950 --> 00:41:41,630
I initially started the company having

00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:43,840
come from a background in recruitment

00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:47,340
and please no one throw anything at me

00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:49,740
so I had absolutely zero technical not

00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:51,960
my natural transition into that sales

00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:53,340
position was to work in kind of an

00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:56,520
account management account direction

00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:57,810
semi project management basis get to

00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:59,220
know a little bit more about it and I've

00:41:57,810 --> 00:42:02,430
gradually moved out of that now and I

00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:04,830
run basically sales alongside our CEO

00:42:02,430 --> 00:42:06,630
for manifesto and you're totally right

00:42:04,830 --> 00:42:09,090
having too much to do leaves you with

00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:10,680
too many things to do and we found that

00:42:09,090 --> 00:42:12,840
something that's been really really

00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:14,880
important to us in our new business is

00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:17,250
to have a decent marketing strategy so a

00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:19,260
lot of the way that we do sales isn't so

00:42:17,250 --> 00:42:21,350
much cold calling in fact I do very

00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:24,230
little cold calling there's no active

00:42:21,350 --> 00:42:26,460
attack towards a product it's more

00:42:24,230 --> 00:42:28,500
educationally based so we host a lot of

00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:30,180
events and we put a lot of content up on

00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:32,610
our website and we do lots of blogging

00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:34,650
we do lots of thought leadership and

00:42:32,610 --> 00:42:35,970
it's mostly network-based so we keep our

00:42:34,650 --> 00:42:37,800
relationship too close to our heart and

00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:39,510
that's why having come from that

00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:41,670
background in account management I think

00:42:39,510 --> 00:42:44,910
definitely helped in terms of bringing

00:42:41,670 --> 00:42:48,600
new business in for manifesto yeah

00:42:44,910 --> 00:42:49,950
interesting thank you two more people at

00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:57,060
the back well we have the time no

00:42:49,950 --> 00:42:58,380
problem oh yes sure I'm woody thanks a

00:42:57,060 --> 00:43:03,540
lot for the top it's really interesting

00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:06,330
I have many questions but the two of

00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:08,490
them that are more important and is

00:43:06,330 --> 00:43:11,220
there any magic number for the team size

00:43:08,490 --> 00:43:13,680
that's one of them the other one is

00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:18,270
there any bonus system for the team for

00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:20,670
the team lead well I'm not sure there's

00:43:18,270 --> 00:43:24,720
a magic number but we like to keep it

00:43:20,670 --> 00:43:26,460
around nine people max also kind of

00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:28,080
depending what kind of disciplines you

00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:30,360
have in your team but I think if it

00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:33,210
succeed beyond that and then you have to

00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:35,610
see if you can split it otherwise yet

00:43:33,210 --> 00:43:38,340
the other problems which I talks about

00:43:35,610 --> 00:43:41,340
will ya come up again and where's the

00:43:38,340 --> 00:43:43,020
responsibility and too many people to

00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:45,440
spread knowledge and to collaborate it

00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:48,210
will also lead to these problems again

00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:52,450
do we have a bonus well I think we

00:43:48,210 --> 00:43:54,619
should sorry about that

00:43:52,450 --> 00:43:59,269
that's a really good question we talked

00:43:54,619 --> 00:44:03,799
about this a lot so yeah what can I say

00:43:59,269 --> 00:44:05,690
about this haha well i think it's it's a

00:44:03,799 --> 00:44:09,319
good idea i would really love moving

00:44:05,690 --> 00:44:12,140
there i think we are not up to the level

00:44:09,319 --> 00:44:18,559
of accountability to make this actually

00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:20,480
happen because like you saw we have like

00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:24,230
targets for efficiency like billable

00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:28,670
rates and we look mostly behind us how

00:44:24,230 --> 00:44:31,220
it went if if we like more depth at

00:44:28,670 --> 00:44:35,150
actually planning for this in the team's

00:44:31,220 --> 00:44:39,499
itself you know now mostly the planning

00:44:35,150 --> 00:44:44,390
is done by me and the corner co-owner if

00:44:39,499 --> 00:44:46,460
any planning once we get there when you

00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:48,410
when teams are actually responsible for

00:44:46,460 --> 00:44:49,940
the future i think it would be a good

00:44:48,410 --> 00:44:53,720
idea to look at some kind of bonus

00:44:49,940 --> 00:44:55,490
system but but now i don't actually as a

00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:57,529
business owner I don't think they

00:44:55,490 --> 00:45:02,930
actually have enough is responsibility

00:44:57,529 --> 00:45:05,450
yet 22 to be like entrepreneurs like

00:45:02,930 --> 00:45:09,739
many entrepreneurs inside of a company

00:45:05,450 --> 00:45:12,289
so but I think you beg to differ I think

00:45:09,739 --> 00:45:14,359
the bonus should be to the team in my

00:45:12,289 --> 00:45:16,220
opinion instead of a single person

00:45:14,359 --> 00:45:18,349
because that was what we want to achieve

00:45:16,220 --> 00:45:20,720
you all have the same goal so in my

00:45:18,349 --> 00:45:24,759
opinion would be a bonus for it for

00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:24,759
entire team thank you

00:45:28,820 --> 00:45:34,010
a my name is shailesh yeah it's a

00:45:32,060 --> 00:45:36,680
similar problem we have now about one

00:45:34,010 --> 00:45:38,660
hundred people company the way we try to

00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:41,450
address this issue is vertical eyes them

00:45:38,660 --> 00:45:44,120
so we had healthcare media publishing as

00:45:41,450 --> 00:45:51,140
verticals and the entire team is

00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:53,720
responsible for a particular target so

00:45:51,140 --> 00:45:56,390
they're responsible for a target and the

00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:58,580
team co-owns their target and then rise

00:45:56,390 --> 00:46:00,590
behind it so there is a mix of subject

00:45:58,580 --> 00:46:02,680
matter expert also within that team and

00:46:00,590 --> 00:46:06,320
that's how they're we've been growing

00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:09,950
from about 50 people company about two

00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:13,040
years ago 220 this year okay that's an

00:46:09,950 --> 00:46:14,900
amazing achievement well we we actually

00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:16,970
are doing something bit similar so I

00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:21,680
didn't want to like throw it into the

00:46:16,970 --> 00:46:24,080
room already beginning but we're trying

00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:26,210
to do like sales meeting next to next

00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:30,860
two are all hands-on meaning and at the

00:46:26,210 --> 00:46:33,470
moment it's manned by the scrum masters

00:46:30,860 --> 00:46:36,320
and what we call consulting project

00:46:33,470 --> 00:46:38,060
managers and we identify like

00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:40,610
opportunities for upselling with

00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:42,230
existing customers which jen tends to be

00:46:40,610 --> 00:46:44,000
a bit easier and they are really

00:46:42,230 --> 00:46:46,220
hands-on you know because they know the

00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:48,910
project the client in detail and it's

00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:54,140
easy to identify like opportunities to

00:46:48,910 --> 00:46:56,630
grow but also we shared like the sales

00:46:54,140 --> 00:46:59,840
targets and try to build areas of

00:46:56,630 --> 00:47:01,310
expertise and so also to get management

00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:03,530
involved and say well we have these

00:47:01,310 --> 00:47:05,930
opportunities guys what do you think

00:47:03,530 --> 00:47:08,510
should we proceed on them we have a few

00:47:05,930 --> 00:47:10,550
criteria on which we judge business

00:47:08,510 --> 00:47:15,650
opportunities and if we should move

00:47:10,550 --> 00:47:17,300
forwards on them or not but it has a

00:47:15,650 --> 00:47:22,700
beginning of a structure but it's still

00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:25,550
like emerging I think in our case we

00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:28,000
still have like the maximum of 10

00:47:25,550 --> 00:47:28,000
minutes left

00:47:36,580 --> 00:47:42,140
maybe a quick one and how if you've got

00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:46,480
more than enough staff for a number of

00:47:42,140 --> 00:47:49,520
teams how do you select those teams and

00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:52,540
do you rotate them so that these guys

00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:57,350
are always working in the same teams

00:47:52,540 --> 00:48:00,560
well we actually let the guys decide on

00:47:57,350 --> 00:48:02,600
a team's themselves we had like and yeah

00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:05,360
we had like a setup but we discussed it

00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:06,890
with every team member and see and in

00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:08,150
the end also some team members switch

00:48:06,890 --> 00:48:10,340
because they rather want to be in

00:48:08,150 --> 00:48:12,280
teammate and be because there already

00:48:10,340 --> 00:48:17,570
were some customers and projects already

00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:18,980
divided among thieves teams and do we

00:48:17,570 --> 00:48:21,800
rotate them yeah in the beginning we

00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:23,630
said let's look into after six months

00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:26,030
see if we need to rotate them or that

00:48:23,630 --> 00:48:28,670
was too quick but we are going to have

00:48:26,030 --> 00:48:30,500
these discussions in a month actually to

00:48:28,670 --> 00:48:33,050
see if we want to rotate them and I

00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:35,600
think it would for the teams you will be

00:48:33,050 --> 00:48:37,250
very beneficial but we also have to look

00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:38,990
into what does this mean for our

00:48:37,250 --> 00:48:48,470
customers and our projects and the end

00:48:38,990 --> 00:48:50,840
all knowledge yeah hello you mentioned

00:48:48,470 --> 00:48:52,940
that you have a different teams but

00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:56,840
basically working on the same God of

00:48:52,940 --> 00:49:02,180
mothers and for example to project teams

00:48:56,840 --> 00:49:06,080
that have a billable rate as kb i have

00:49:02,180 --> 00:49:08,990
you noticed any kind of competition day

00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:14,210
motivation effect and if so how do you

00:49:08,990 --> 00:49:16,820
battle it i think we notice it

00:49:14,210 --> 00:49:18,650
especially because one of the teams so

00:49:16,820 --> 00:49:20,420
that the figures of being on earth and

00:49:18,650 --> 00:49:23,420
five percent bilbo were actually true

00:49:20,420 --> 00:49:26,690
because one of the themes is pretty

00:49:23,420 --> 00:49:29,720
stuffed in it some months and the other

00:49:26,690 --> 00:49:31,790
team is working on our distribution so

00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:33,950
we're actually not really billable so

00:49:31,790 --> 00:49:37,910
yeah at the beginning these figures also

00:49:33,950 --> 00:49:40,220
could raise some yeah i'm not sure i

00:49:37,910 --> 00:49:41,870
have to call it but in the end it was

00:49:40,220 --> 00:49:43,250
just about being transparent and at the

00:49:41,870 --> 00:49:43,680
other team okay even though they are not

00:49:43,250 --> 00:49:46,650
that

00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:49,079
and this moment well the company has

00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:51,450
chose to build this distribution so we

00:49:49,079 --> 00:49:54,059
know that we wouldn't be billable but by

00:49:51,450 --> 00:49:55,829
explaining what kinds of work we do and

00:49:54,059 --> 00:49:57,660
and that were basically doing the same

00:49:55,829 --> 00:50:00,450
except it's not billable and that were

00:49:57,660 --> 00:50:02,099
just as busy and that made sure that the

00:50:00,450 --> 00:50:06,170
teams are on the same page again so yeah

00:50:02,099 --> 00:50:06,170
there was some friction I think yeah

00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:14,180
copilot it tastes kind of a internal

00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:20,700
project with a mini team sold yeah

00:50:14,180 --> 00:50:23,550
another question how do you evade the

00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:25,589
trap of not my business when you have a

00:50:23,550 --> 00:50:28,859
different themes basically combating

00:50:25,589 --> 00:50:32,670
each other and then having to do the

00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:34,980
knowledge sharing AKA well this is not

00:50:32,670 --> 00:50:37,230
my stuff I don't need to care about it

00:50:34,980 --> 00:50:40,950
but instead of working with the team

00:50:37,230 --> 00:50:43,500
spirit giving those so called mini teams

00:50:40,950 --> 00:50:46,380
as a one big team and having the common

00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:48,170
goal mm-hmm well that's the world is one

00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:50,730
of the biggest challenges you need to

00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:52,950
add to make sure that the team is all

00:50:50,730 --> 00:50:55,230
fighting for the same goal and that's

00:50:52,950 --> 00:50:58,260
very new to us especially well across

00:50:55,230 --> 00:50:59,970
these disciplines we used to start with

00:50:58,260 --> 00:51:01,740
the design and then the development and

00:50:59,970 --> 00:51:03,960
when we are at the part of the

00:51:01,740 --> 00:51:09,839
development designer will basically care

00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:11,849
anymore and yeah I think we also have

00:51:09,839 --> 00:51:15,030
these meetings within a team to talk

00:51:11,849 --> 00:51:16,770
about it say hey we noticed that design

00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:19,170
has less to do what can we do about it

00:51:16,770 --> 00:51:22,049
we noticed is that this goal is not

00:51:19,170 --> 00:51:23,910
achieved by everybody so it's just a

00:51:22,049 --> 00:51:26,280
matter of discussing it on a monthly

00:51:23,910 --> 00:51:29,730
basis and being transparent and try to

00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:31,440
be honest to each other yeah and no I

00:51:29,730 --> 00:51:33,780
tend to I tend to agree that

00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:35,609
transparency is a very big part of this

00:51:33,780 --> 00:51:38,339
so like I mentioned we used to do this

00:51:35,609 --> 00:51:40,980
quarterly reviews or maybe even a yearly

00:51:38,339 --> 00:51:43,349
reviews that really doesn't work so then

00:51:40,980 --> 00:51:45,450
people get like surprised at the end of

00:51:43,349 --> 00:51:46,109
the year so what have you been doing you

00:51:45,450 --> 00:51:48,630
know you

00:51:46,109 --> 00:51:50,670
like not billable or whatever so but if

00:51:48,630 --> 00:51:53,910
you somehow make this like an easy

00:51:50,670 --> 00:51:56,749
subject to discuss regularly it doesn't

00:51:53,910 --> 00:51:58,890
emerge as an issue that much and

00:51:56,749 --> 00:52:01,799
different thing is that we started to

00:51:58,890 --> 00:52:04,829
count are we somehow we always have the

00:52:01,799 --> 00:52:08,489
ambition to do our own projects you know

00:52:04,829 --> 00:52:12,690
like modules or whatever and we separate

00:52:08,489 --> 00:52:14,009
those but to count them as the top of

00:52:12,690 --> 00:52:17,130
the billable right because obviously

00:52:14,009 --> 00:52:18,900
that's time spent being productive very

00:52:17,130 --> 00:52:23,029
productive even giving back to the

00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:24,630
community one could say so so that

00:52:23,029 --> 00:52:26,489
especially when you're working on a

00:52:24,630 --> 00:52:28,109
distribution our example that aligns

00:52:26,489 --> 00:52:31,170
those billable rates more to like

00:52:28,109 --> 00:52:32,640
realistic expectations instead of just

00:52:31,170 --> 00:52:34,410
saying well you're at twenty percent

00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:41,279
because you spent your time at modules

00:52:34,410 --> 00:52:44,309
that's strange so yes please the were

00:52:41,279 --> 00:52:49,799
like questions at the back which would

00:52:44,309 --> 00:52:52,380
be so nice to come forward yeah to your

00:52:49,799 --> 00:52:55,380
question that you have before I think

00:52:52,380 --> 00:52:58,289
you should ask the teams if you empower

00:52:55,380 --> 00:53:00,150
your teams to decide themselves you

00:52:58,289 --> 00:53:03,420
should ask the question that you just

00:53:00,150 --> 00:53:05,910
asked us from the teams because if

00:53:03,420 --> 00:53:08,489
they're not for it then I think it's a

00:53:05,910 --> 00:53:11,130
bad idea if they don't want to wear many

00:53:08,489 --> 00:53:14,609
hats like you said they won't take it

00:53:11,130 --> 00:53:16,710
it's bad yet just push the idea but if

00:53:14,609 --> 00:53:18,989
they're open to it maybe it can even

00:53:16,710 --> 00:53:21,839
vary from team to team it doesn't matter

00:53:18,989 --> 00:53:25,349
if one team wants it and the other one

00:53:21,839 --> 00:53:28,319
doesn't why not why cannot be into some

00:53:25,349 --> 00:53:31,019
teams and not in others so that's my

00:53:28,319 --> 00:53:35,119
opinion of that I also have a question

00:53:31,019 --> 00:53:38,489
for you you showed a lot of numbers and

00:53:35,119 --> 00:53:40,799
talked about the teens but did you

00:53:38,489 --> 00:53:44,339
measure how the changes that you made

00:53:40,799 --> 00:53:48,239
how do people felt about the changes did

00:53:44,339 --> 00:53:52,230
you measure your happiness or spirit or

00:53:48,239 --> 00:53:54,900
did you get any numbers on those short

00:53:52,230 --> 00:53:56,400
answer is yes I think I'll get a feeling

00:53:54,900 --> 00:53:58,099
that answer this one but first to get to

00:53:56,400 --> 00:54:03,799
your first one

00:53:58,099 --> 00:54:05,479
first guess you could try to place this

00:54:03,799 --> 00:54:07,099
responsibility into the team's to make

00:54:05,479 --> 00:54:10,460
their own decisions but in our

00:54:07,099 --> 00:54:12,619
experience this maybe goes to bit too

00:54:10,460 --> 00:54:15,920
far at the beginning because you know

00:54:12,619 --> 00:54:18,799
like I said people are not entrepreneurs

00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:20,869
some of those people choose not to be

00:54:18,799 --> 00:54:22,910
entrepreneurs like like a conscious

00:54:20,869 --> 00:54:27,229
decision and we shouldn't pretend they

00:54:22,910 --> 00:54:29,239
are and if you try to ask to make them

00:54:27,229 --> 00:54:31,700
those decisions they basically force

00:54:29,239 --> 00:54:33,950
them to to take on a much bigger role

00:54:31,700 --> 00:54:36,499
than they used to have like like only

00:54:33,950 --> 00:54:38,720
six months ago so maybe I maybe I think

00:54:36,499 --> 00:54:40,640
we might have get there but it will

00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:43,849
certainly be slow so that's that's my

00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:45,339
opinion on it and I think there is like

00:54:43,849 --> 00:54:48,440
a responsibility for management

00:54:45,339 --> 00:54:51,890
certainly as well to make some some good

00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:55,220
effort to solve this I'll get about the

00:54:51,890 --> 00:54:58,519
happiness question to you yeah we don't

00:54:55,220 --> 00:55:02,269
have very strict metrics but we do do it

00:54:58,519 --> 00:55:04,400
in different ways the one team is more

00:55:02,269 --> 00:55:07,670
evaluating and then talking about in the

00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:11,390
meetings that we have as a team and just

00:55:07,670 --> 00:55:13,339
evaluating on yeah not on specific

00:55:11,390 --> 00:55:15,710
metrics actually and the other team is

00:55:13,339 --> 00:55:19,339
actually like I think it's actually on a

00:55:15,710 --> 00:55:22,130
weekly basis the happiness it they had

00:55:19,339 --> 00:55:24,799
in that week so they are doing some more

00:55:22,130 --> 00:55:29,079
metrics like but that's within the teams

00:55:24,799 --> 00:55:29,079
is it different how they solve it

00:55:33,570 --> 00:55:40,320
so I think we answered all of your

00:55:35,730 --> 00:55:44,090
questions excellent well that's about

00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:47,640
right we have like 2 to 2 minutes left

00:55:44,090 --> 00:55:50,250
so just as a reminder there are like

00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:51,720
sprints on friday if you're the few

00:55:50,250 --> 00:55:55,350
colors that are in the room be sure to

I'd haven't talked about go gorilla much

00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:19,050
I skipped some of my lines at the

00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:21,150
beginning I saw but yeah may be

00:56:19,050 --> 00:56:24,960
interesting to know we have like big

00:56:21,150 --> 00:56:26,730
