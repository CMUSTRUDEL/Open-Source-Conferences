Title: DrupalCon Dublin 2016: Transitioning to fixed teams
Publication date: 2016-09-27
Playlist: DrupalCon Dublin 2016
Description: 
	In this session a SCRUM master, Evelien Schut, and a business owner, Mieszko Czyzyk, share the lessons learned from transitioning to multidisciplinary, fixed teams within the agency model.

These insights are based on our experience at GoalGorilla, a 25 people Drupal agency based in the Netherlands. They transitioned over a period of several months from a more traditional department structure working on ‘projects’ to a fixed team structure working for clients and building and maintaining products.

This talk is interesting for SCRUM masters and project managers looking for tips on common challenges such as:

organizing the roles of team members, for example product owners and other non-developers such as designers
managing agile sprints for different customers, with one team. 
time and billable rate reporting
facilitating a distributed team across timezones
For business owners this talk is interesting because it touches upon:

real world business metrics such as billable rates and turnover per full-time employee
a vision how this team structure supports a culture of shared responsibility, collaboration and professional excellence
a vision how this team structure supports a path for sustainable agency growth, with reduced risk 
The last 10 minutes are reserved for discussion on an aspect that proves to be especially challenging:

integrating sales into the teams instead, of more traditionally, account managers or directors
