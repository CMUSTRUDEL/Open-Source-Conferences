Title: DrupalCon Dublin 2016: Super Collaborative Design Processes for Teams
Publication date: 2016-09-27
Playlist: DrupalCon Dublin 2016
Description: 
	How can we improve our design process to include insights and experience from all members of the team? How can we lead projects through design and encourage collaboration for better feedback, and happier clients?

If you've ever struggled to recieve good design feedback, engage clients, and get buy in from the rest of the team then this talk will improve your life.

I'll be talking about what I've learned to improve my design process over the past year. You'll learn about effective techniques for design workshop planning, facilitation, and consensus building.

I'm a Louis lineman I work as a UX

00:00:02,909 --> 00:00:08,670
designer at a small agency called

00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:11,010
convivio in a previous life I used to

00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:12,990
contribute a lot to do / call I was one

00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:16,470
of the top 30 contributors to do bleh

00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:17,850
but I don't do it anymore if you if you

00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:18,930
want to ask me questions about that then

00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:20,789
this is the wrong section for it because

00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:24,330
I I lab so you know nothing anymore

00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:25,769
about that kind of stuff but I've been

00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:29,130
with convivio for about three months

00:00:25,769 --> 00:00:30,779
we've just started up and something that

00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:32,880
we we started out is if we wanted to

00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:34,110
focus on just the essential things of

00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,270
running a business like getting clients

00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:37,710
and and establishing our process and

00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:40,050
stuff so we actually don't have a logo

00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:43,050
yet or Twitter episodes just blank and

00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:44,309
and I said as we're revealing the logo

00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:46,230
tomorrow I thought it would be cool to

00:00:44,309 --> 00:00:49,590
like kind of show it as a preview in

00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:51,480
this session and although the it's just

00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:53,309
as a little sneak peek so there's no one

00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:54,629
M no one else has seen this outside the

00:00:53,309 --> 00:01:02,370
company yet it's kind of like a first

00:00:54,629 --> 00:01:04,680
time thing yeah it's a obviously this

00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:06,450
talk isn't about convivio or about why

00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:08,880
we have a picnic bench as a logo that's

00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:11,580
a separate discussion anyway let's talk

00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:14,159
about design processes and what makes a

00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:15,810
good design process and what you need

00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,390
from a good design process is consensus

00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:21,299
based on objectives instead of opinions

00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:22,439
so you don't want to get to a subjective

00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:23,970
point of view where people think oh I

00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:26,100
want this and someone else wants this

00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:27,270
you want to be sharing the same objects

00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:29,610
as a team and you want to agree that

00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:30,900
this is what you want to get towards you

00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:32,670
want to have buying from stakeholders

00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:34,290
people who are you know paying for the

00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:37,619
design work you want them to be able to

00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:39,299
understand and what you're giving them

00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:40,560
and you want to get buy-in from

00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:42,210
developers as well because they actually

00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,710
have to take this stuff forward and they

00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:46,020
have to implement it in the real world

00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:48,540
and if there isn't like a consistency

00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:49,439
they have understanding and sometimes it

00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:51,000
ends up being something it's too

00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:52,380
difficult to implement or it becomes

00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,549
something that doesn't really meet the

00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:59,280
initial vision and also you kind of want

00:01:56,549 --> 00:02:01,530
to have a good design and I mean that in

00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,329
a very subjective way where if you're

00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:06,210
going home into the day you feel good

00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:07,680
about their the work you've done and you

00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:08,970
don't feel like all this thing's going

00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,120
horribly wrong you know you just feel

00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:13,610
good about it yourself

00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,799
and I forgot to ask am I was wondering

00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:18,140
what what kind of roles people do in the

00:02:15,799 --> 00:02:20,510
audience and can you put your hand up if

00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:23,959
you're a product owner or project

00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:25,730
manager or something like that can you

00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:27,829
put your hand up if you're a developer a

00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:29,540
front end or back end developer cool

00:02:27,829 --> 00:02:31,940
yeah that's why I expect me to book on

00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:36,140
and can you put your hand up if you're a

00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:38,049
designer or UX designer cool okay yeah

00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:39,890
so it's good to have a bit of a mix I'm

00:02:38,049 --> 00:02:43,040
shortly talk a little bit about my old

00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:45,140
design process so the way I used to work

00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,579
when I was designing is I used to gather

00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:47,750
information from people so I used to

00:02:46,579 --> 00:02:49,879
interview the stakeholders about the

00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:51,230
business gather any existing the

00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:54,049
research they had from analytics

00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:55,819
software going interview the users that

00:02:54,049 --> 00:02:57,980
identified and to see what their

00:02:55,819 --> 00:02:59,599
problems were and then set the

00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:01,069
priorities objectives or for the

00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:03,560
designers you know what it needs to do

00:03:01,069 --> 00:03:06,140
what it needs to achieve and then I used

00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:07,609
to go into like a design cave and this

00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:09,260
is where I used to sit on my own and try

00:03:07,609 --> 00:03:11,629
and figure out all the possible you know

00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:13,040
up design options and then try and

00:03:11,629 --> 00:03:15,109
figure out what the best of them was and

00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:17,180
I used to come out of that cave and go

00:03:15,109 --> 00:03:19,250
on like present this design concepts and

00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:21,440
this could be like a wire frame or mock

00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:24,290
up or something else depending on the

00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,790
projects um so we have to arrange a

00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:27,680
meeting I represent you know presented

00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:29,329
design and then you get feedback from

00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,400
people you know the product owners any

00:03:29,329 --> 00:03:35,810
developers that are working in that

00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:37,340
phase and the stakeholders and you don't

00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:39,169
I'd end up doing this quite a few time

00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:40,430
so I go back and iterate and I you know

00:03:39,169 --> 00:03:41,959
take the feedback that they give me the

00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:44,239
last meeting try and come up with an

00:03:41,959 --> 00:03:46,669
better arrange another meeting and then

00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:48,230
go through that feedback loop again does

00:03:46,669 --> 00:03:51,379
this kind of process sound familiar to

00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:54,319
anyone at all okay it's not just me okay

00:03:51,379 --> 00:03:57,049
good so as you can imagine i'm sure

00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:59,569
you've experienced i had quite a few

00:03:57,049 --> 00:04:01,250
problems with this process especially

00:03:59,569 --> 00:04:03,290
around the kind of feedback that i used

00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:06,169
to get and some of the examples of the

00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:08,419
feedback isa get was can we make it

00:04:06,169 --> 00:04:10,069
green you know I don't have anything

00:04:08,419 --> 00:04:12,410
against green greens a nice color and

00:04:10,069 --> 00:04:14,269
but you love someone who say let's make

00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:16,340
it green and you say why should we make

00:04:14,269 --> 00:04:20,060
it green and they say well we you know

00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:22,159
it's I like green I like it and I guess

00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:23,120
like this makes it very difficult and if

00:04:22,159 --> 00:04:24,830
you're not aligned on the same

00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,150
objectives to say oh yeah green is an

00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:28,300
nice color does it suit what we're

00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:30,860
trying to do doesn't meet the objectives

00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:33,080
can we use it in that same way just

00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:35,629
because we like it I used to get that a

00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:37,370
lot you say the kind of feedback they'll

00:04:35,629 --> 00:04:40,580
say I think it should look like you know

00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:42,370
amazon tinder uber em anything that is

00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:44,750
those popular anything that the

00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:46,310
shareholders or that particular person

00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:48,610
liked at the time we thought was the

00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:50,960
best design let's just copy there and

00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:52,759
because that's the thing that they liked

00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,349
the most and of course I'd have to

00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:56,449
explain the time while the objectives of

00:04:54,349 --> 00:04:58,430
tinder or uber are different as the

00:04:56,449 --> 00:04:59,960
thing we're designing the users were

00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:02,259
designing for our different as well so

00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:04,190
it doesn't always help just to copy the

00:05:02,259 --> 00:05:06,919
thing that we like the most if it

00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:08,659
doesn't meet the same objectives are you

00:05:06,919 --> 00:05:11,900
sure to get this you know the wall of

00:05:08,659 --> 00:05:13,699
silence just just no feedback at all and

00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:14,990
there's ways around this as well you

00:05:13,699 --> 00:05:17,300
know I try to frame the feedback that

00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:19,190
you want asking people deeper questions

00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:21,979
to try and get the right kind of

00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:23,569
feedback out out of them I always used

00:05:21,979 --> 00:05:25,909
to get people saying that I just don't I

00:05:23,569 --> 00:05:26,960
don't like it and people say they don't

00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:28,639
like something that I can't really

00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,199
articulate why and this is valid

00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:32,360
feedback but I found it very difficult

00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:34,279
to get this into actionable feedback

00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:36,020
that I could use to actually improve it

00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:39,199
because there's nothing you can do just

00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:41,569
saying I don't I don't like it another

00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:43,879
good one was a hello I don't like it

00:05:41,569 --> 00:05:46,339
goodbye which is also known as the

00:05:43,879 --> 00:05:49,520
swooping poop when a senior executive

00:05:46,339 --> 00:05:51,259
comes into a halfway through the process

00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,789
into a meeting hasn't really paid

00:05:51,259 --> 00:05:54,680
attention or read any of the stuff that

00:05:52,789 --> 00:05:56,389
you've done beforehand or understood any

00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:58,250
of the reasons why you've got to where

00:05:56,389 --> 00:06:00,199
you are and just says I don't like it I

00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:02,089
don't get it I'm not interested goodbye

00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:05,029
and this can really disrupt the process

00:06:02,089 --> 00:06:06,199
and it's really difficult to to deal

00:06:05,029 --> 00:06:08,210
with this kind of stuff if you're doing

00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:09,979
a process that takes it takes a long

00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:12,860
amount of time and then song comes in

00:06:09,979 --> 00:06:15,500
and kind of force you to start again and

00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:17,960
another one used to get was I brought my

00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:21,560
own wireframes people on the client side

00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:23,330
and people who they either you know have

00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:24,979
some design knowledge already or they're

00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:27,349
passionate about design they want to you

00:06:24,979 --> 00:06:28,250
know understand design a bit more yeah

00:06:27,349 --> 00:06:29,539
and they have their own solutions

00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:31,370
they're excited about when they want to

00:06:29,539 --> 00:06:33,709
share and they want to you know push

00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:36,169
their ideas through I found this really

00:06:33,709 --> 00:06:37,880
difficult to deal with and because I was

00:06:36,169 --> 00:06:38,520
so worried about having the whole design

00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:40,199
by Kim

00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:42,449
thing and having like this mishmash of

00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:44,430
ideas I couldn't control I actually

00:06:42,449 --> 00:06:46,440
found that in some ways like I really

00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:49,229
shut these people down in like a way

00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:52,319
that wasn't very positive and I found

00:06:49,229 --> 00:06:54,389
that I it created a couple of like

00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:56,250
difficult situations and one of the

00:06:54,389 --> 00:06:58,349
things I realized later on is that M

00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:59,940
when you know one of the people I was

00:06:58,349 --> 00:07:02,099
dealing with who really wanted to submit

00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:03,659
wireframes they were presenting

00:07:02,099 --> 00:07:05,520
something on-screen and I saw there was

00:07:03,659 --> 00:07:07,919
a bookmark in their browser and it was a

00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,780
link to the M the website for the

00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:11,639
General Assembly which is a school in

00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:12,900
London for learning user experience I

00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:14,099
realized they were trying to let you

00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:15,210
know they were learning these things in

00:07:14,099 --> 00:07:16,860
their own spare time they're really

00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:19,259
passionate about it they really wanted

00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:20,280
to find now way to contribute to the and

00:07:19,259 --> 00:07:22,860
using the things they've been learning

00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:24,240
and I realized at that point I I've been

00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:25,409
making like a big mistake by just

00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,280
shutting these people down and not

00:07:25,409 --> 00:07:30,830
giving them an opportunity to contribute

00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:33,120
so that was a big turning point I think

00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:35,039
another piece of feel about that I got

00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,389
was oh that's going to be expensive to

00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:40,530
build which I'm sure some people have

00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:41,610
said as developers and it's sometimes

00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:43,050
it's difficult if you don't have a

00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:45,240
shared understanding about why you're

00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:47,490
doing what you're doing and you can get

00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:50,210
some some conflict or some dissonance

00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:51,930
between the designers and the developers

00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:53,250
because they don't have the shared

00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:55,289
understanding of why we're doing what

00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:57,539
we're doing and I found this really

00:07:55,289 --> 00:08:00,419
difficult if you don't bring everyone

00:07:57,539 --> 00:08:02,009
together make decisions together it can

00:08:00,419 --> 00:08:04,169
be quite demotivating if developers to

00:08:02,009 --> 00:08:05,909
understand why they're having to do the

00:08:04,169 --> 00:08:09,779
extra work to change things and if

00:08:05,909 --> 00:08:11,370
you're working with drupal vm changing

00:08:09,779 --> 00:08:12,870
certain parts of the user experience is

00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:15,539
really hard because it's theming where

00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:17,880
isn't amazing but it's not better than

00:08:15,539 --> 00:08:19,409
it was before it's still tough to to

00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:22,380
change things completely and to make big

00:08:19,409 --> 00:08:23,909
UX improvements and other but but the

00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:26,159
biggest issue I had with this kind of

00:08:23,909 --> 00:08:28,080
process is it just took ages these

00:08:26,159 --> 00:08:29,430
feedback loops are super long I used to

00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,500
have to go and work on this on my own

00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:33,870
arrange meeting is get everyone together

00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:35,729
in the same time the same place you know

00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:37,500
have like a quick half hour discussion

00:08:35,729 --> 00:08:41,039
about it and go away and have to do that

00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:42,270
again again again so just took a really

00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:43,620
long time to get to a point where we

00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:46,020
finally had something that we were happy

00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:48,000
with and I was actually curious because

00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:50,940
I've had a few comments when I've done

00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,070
this session before if anyone else had

00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:56,080
any ideas of other problem

00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:56,080
they had with this kind of process

00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:04,480
that's okay oh it's heartbreaking

00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:23,930
icie you're saying that like it brings

00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:30,410
out a lot of motion from Ebola of

00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:32,690
distress yeah I know you mean I guess

00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:34,010
it's like yeah motions are difficult

00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:36,310
because I always play a part and you

00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:39,320
can't avoid a motion i guess and then

00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:40,760
finding a way to like to allow it

00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:42,620
without letting a letting it disrupt the

00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:44,870
process and letting people get overly

00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:47,750
frustrated and fed up is it's really

00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:49,040
tough so there's lots of different

00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:50,990
things you can do to improve this

00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:53,019
process by like framing feedback and ask

00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:55,639
them deeper questions and trying to like

00:09:53,019 --> 00:09:57,649
keep the meetings regulated in all the

00:09:55,639 --> 00:09:59,209
time and that kind of stuff but I was

00:09:57,649 --> 00:10:02,000
really think to myself like is there a

00:09:59,209 --> 00:10:03,800
better way I can we is a better way to

00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,769
do this completely and I started looking

00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:08,570
into you know workshops a way of

00:10:06,769 --> 00:10:12,350
achieving a consensus in a short space

00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:14,209
of time I started looking into like the

00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:18,790
design studio and the design sprint

00:10:14,209 --> 00:10:20,930
methods and they're all about getting em

00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:23,779
through loads of different ideas and

00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:25,670
getting down to a consensus of one idea

00:10:23,779 --> 00:10:28,220
to take forward in a very short space of

00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:32,810
time so the design sprint is a really

00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:34,490
popular new methodology that's around

00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:35,990
because it's been promoted by Google

00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:37,250
Ventures they created the idea and

00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:40,130
they've been publicizing a lot they

00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:41,540
wrote a book about it and it's kind of

00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:44,750
focused towards startups you know it's

00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:47,870
about being able to to get through an

00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:49,610
entire process of learning in just five

00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:51,079
days and i really recommend reading the

00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:52,579
book because it goes over i love these

00:10:51,079 --> 00:10:54,709
like principles and why you should do

00:10:52,579 --> 00:10:57,769
them and also goes into loads of detail

00:10:54,709 --> 00:10:59,240
and all the different stages that i

00:10:57,769 --> 00:11:02,930
won't be as going to in as much detail

00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:04,730
in the time i have and but the thing i

00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:06,380
like about these kind of methodologies

00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:08,060
is you can kind of take the bits that

00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:09,740
work for you and I kind of like breaking

00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:13,069
them down into the different parts and

00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:14,899
then and then like building your own

00:11:13,069 --> 00:11:16,810
workshop structure that kind of works

00:11:14,899 --> 00:11:18,620
for you or the clients that you have

00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:20,540
another thing that was a big inspiration

00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:24,709
were the methodologies and their

00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:27,840
processes behind a I do the creativity

00:11:24,709 --> 00:11:30,630
and innovation company

00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:33,090
the thing about design thinking is it

00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:34,770
allows people to build on the other the

00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:36,780
ideas of others instead of instead of

00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:38,340
just having this one thread you think

00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:39,780
about it I come up with an idea and then

00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:41,310
somebody from somewhere else says oh

00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:43,440
that makes me think we should do this

00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:44,970
and then we could do that and then you

00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:47,730
get to a place that you just can't get

00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:49,980
to in one mind if you follow David Kelly

00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:51,960
around I do you can see how he has

00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:54,660
infused that thinking into the legendre

00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:57,360
Palo Alto firm he founded more than 20

00:11:54,660 --> 00:12:00,050
years ago breakthrough ideas happen

00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:02,970
every day here the key to unlocking

00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:06,420
creativity I do maybe their unorthodox

00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:07,650
approach to problem solving they throw a

00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:09,600
bunch of people with different

00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:11,700
backgrounds together in a room so you're

00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,440
in the business in yep my backgrounds in

00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:16,530
the software engineering journalism

00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:18,780
aerospace engineer doctors opera singers

00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:20,820
and anthropologists for example and get

00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:22,200
them to brainstorm you got to have a

00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:24,210
certain culture you got to have

00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,920
collaboration you got to have diversity

00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:27,750
you gotta have an anthropologist and a

00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,610
business person and an engineer and a

00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:31,890
computer scientist all of those kinds of

00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:34,680
you got it that's the hard part is the

00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:36,720
cultural thing of having a diverse group

00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:38,520
of people and having them be good at

00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:41,220
building on each other's ideas they

00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:44,000
encourage wild ideas and visualize

00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:47,040
solutions by making actual prototypes

00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,950
but the main tenant is empathy for the

00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:53,010
consumer figuring out what human really

00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:54,270
want by watching them so a lot of these

00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:57,060
processes of a bit around for a long

00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:59,340
time I I do is one of the companies that

00:12:57,060 --> 00:13:01,830
have been really leading in this area

00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:03,900
and but whatever name you call it these

00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:05,640
different processes or workshops kind of

00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:08,190
have the same building blocks to them

00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:10,580
and there's about four steps to them

00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:14,280
which is understanding defining

00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:15,780
diverging and then deciding and the

00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:18,300
important part is that you do this all

00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:20,840
together as a team so it's about having

00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:24,480
product owners together stakeholders

00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:26,070
together at developers and designers and

00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,750
you make the most of this really broad

00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:29,190
range of experiences like David Kelley

00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:31,230
was saying in the video it's about

00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:32,490
bringing people together who come from

00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:33,570
different backgrounds because they're

00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:36,300
able to build on each other's ideas

00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:39,120
instead of just em coming at it from the

00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:40,470
same point of view so the stakeholders

00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,220
really understand the business really

00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:43,589
well

00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:45,000
and that market the product owners

00:13:43,589 --> 00:13:47,069
really understand the users and what

00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,569
they're trying to build developers have

00:13:47,069 --> 00:13:49,949
a good understanding about how it could

00:13:48,569 --> 00:13:52,379
actually be built and how it could work

00:13:49,949 --> 00:13:53,850
technically and designers understand the

00:13:52,379 --> 00:13:59,160
different common patterns of ease of use

00:13:53,850 --> 00:14:00,360
and usability and in modern UI trends so

00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:02,930
again let you understand the information

00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:05,129
together you define the problem together

00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:07,110
you diverge which is all about

00:14:05,129 --> 00:14:09,689
generating as many ideas as possible and

00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:11,939
then you just side find a way to boil it

00:14:09,689 --> 00:14:14,000
down and have one concept that you all

00:14:11,939 --> 00:14:17,310
agree is it's a good way to move forward

00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:20,490
so talking about the first the first

00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:21,569
section understanding so what you do in

00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:25,589
this stage is share all the information

00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:27,269
with everyone in the workshop am usually

00:14:25,589 --> 00:14:28,740
the best way to do this is quick

00:14:27,269 --> 00:14:29,879
lightning round presentations so if you

00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:31,800
have people there who have done a lot of

00:14:29,879 --> 00:14:33,480
user research it's about giving a quick

00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:35,459
five minute summary of what they found

00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:37,769
out during the research if you have

00:14:35,459 --> 00:14:38,939
people who understand the analytic side

00:14:37,769 --> 00:14:41,069
of it it's about giving a quick overview

00:14:38,939 --> 00:14:43,139
to everyone and this is a really

00:14:41,069 --> 00:14:45,120
important part and I get I try and get

00:14:43,139 --> 00:14:46,529
everyone who's listening to take notes

00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,269
on the information they're receiving

00:14:46,529 --> 00:14:51,120
because the next thing you need to do is

00:14:48,269 --> 00:14:55,740
kind of take that information and define

00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:58,139
these problems and what you can find so

00:14:55,740 --> 00:15:00,600
a problem statement is a really clear

00:14:58,139 --> 00:15:01,769
and concise definition of the problem

00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,930
that you're trying to solve and that's

00:15:01,769 --> 00:15:05,730
like the objective of the workshop and

00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:08,759
this really helps focus the entire team

00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:10,470
around what one objective is so example

00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:12,360
of this would be something like students

00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:13,860
don't receive enough guidance on how to

00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:17,779
develop the skills that will enable them

00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:20,639
to learn and flourish and this really

00:15:17,779 --> 00:15:22,920
having it in Spada in this way and in a

00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:24,660
user focus kind of way kind of keeps the

00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:26,850
focus on that problem that you're trying

00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:28,680
to solve and it's really important when

00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:29,850
you write these in a workshop to put

00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:32,459
them up on the wall and keep them there

00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:34,379
all day because they're they'll be

00:15:32,459 --> 00:15:37,160
constantly refer back to throughout the

00:15:34,379 --> 00:15:39,449
entire day and when I find that and

00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:41,160
keeping them in people's mind allows

00:15:39,449 --> 00:15:45,540
them to quickly refer back to oh I want

00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:47,279
to solve this problem in this way the

00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:48,930
next step is probably the most important

00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:50,790
step which is diverging and this is

00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:53,370
about generating as many different ideas

00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:54,600
as possible and exploring every single

00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:56,550
possible solution that you can

00:15:54,600 --> 00:16:00,120
have to solve a problem before moving

00:15:56,550 --> 00:16:02,100
forward and the the author of the design

00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:04,740
sprint were summed up in a way i really

00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:06,060
like he says remember in the legends of

00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:07,769
Zelda how the map put lights up

00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:09,779
different rooms when you moved around

00:16:07,769 --> 00:16:11,279
the dungeons and and that's kind of what

00:16:09,779 --> 00:16:14,550
you're doing is going around all the

00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:16,350
different possible and areas and kind of

00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:17,310
exploring every where you could go

00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:19,410
before you decide which direction

00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:22,350
usually go into so I guess it's kind of

00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:24,959
like just revealing every single

00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:29,040
possible direction before moving forward

00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:32,610
um so where I like to do this is with

00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:36,509
sketching because I find that most

00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:38,399
people in technology dont and dont use

00:16:36,509 --> 00:16:40,560
pen and paper all the time some people

00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:42,360
do but usually it's it's something that

00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,589
they don't use so much anymore which

00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:45,630
means that no one really has an

00:16:43,589 --> 00:16:49,860
advantage over anyone else it's not like

00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:53,519
we're using photoshop or keynote or you

00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:55,740
know HTML and CSS to make these ideas so

00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:56,970
no one really has like a an advantage

00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:58,380
over anyone else they can't really make

00:16:56,970 --> 00:17:03,480
it much better than you can just draw

00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:04,699
pen on paper but I find that M it's

00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:07,049
quite tough to do this stuff because

00:17:04,699 --> 00:17:10,500
because you will don't use pen a paper

00:17:07,049 --> 00:17:13,110
as much um they can be really under

00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:14,370
confident and really rusty with it so

00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:15,990
getting people warmed up it's probably

00:17:14,370 --> 00:17:17,640
the first most important thing that I

00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:19,730
could do and one of the ways i found

00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:22,289
that quite like is called squiggle birds

00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:24,270
and what you do or you get everyone to

00:17:22,289 --> 00:17:26,159
do is to get a blank piece of paper and

00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:29,730
just draw random squiggles all over the

00:17:26,159 --> 00:17:33,960
page it may make them do quite a few and

00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:36,330
then you give them a beak and eyes and

00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:38,039
and the legs and the tail and they have

00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:40,110
to try and put these objects or draw

00:17:38,039 --> 00:17:42,659
them on to their squiggles and try and

00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:44,159
make it look like a bird and it's just

00:17:42,659 --> 00:17:45,570
kind of fun because it's really silly

00:17:44,159 --> 00:17:47,870
and you don't have to really try very

00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:49,860
hard but it kind of shows people that em

00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:51,860
that you can kind of make anything look

00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:54,809
like anything if you try hard enough and

00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:57,929
or at least place just the right parts

00:17:54,809 --> 00:17:59,610
in there to make it recognizable so it's

00:17:57,929 --> 00:18:01,140
a really fun way just to get started and

00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:04,980
get people used to drawing with a pen or

00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:07,080
a pencil um another thing that I was

00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:08,419
recommended to do by another agency when

00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:11,210
I last gave this was a

00:18:08,419 --> 00:18:13,609
is a portrait drawing exercise so you

00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:15,049
pair people up and you get them to look

00:18:13,609 --> 00:18:18,049
at each other and try and draw each

00:18:15,049 --> 00:18:18,919
other in about a minute um and it's kind

00:18:18,049 --> 00:18:21,139
of funny because they're always really

00:18:18,919 --> 00:18:23,269
bad and get to laugh about it and they

00:18:21,139 --> 00:18:24,499
also kind of creates this connection

00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:25,879
between two people you actually have to

00:18:24,499 --> 00:18:28,549
look at someone's face for a minute and

00:18:25,879 --> 00:18:30,019
no one does that anymore really so it's

00:18:28,549 --> 00:18:31,639
kind of a fun way to get people like

00:18:30,019 --> 00:18:34,429
relax just looking each other and

00:18:31,639 --> 00:18:38,149
communicating with each other yeah so

00:18:34,429 --> 00:18:40,100
that's fun like I said like the the aim

00:18:38,149 --> 00:18:41,899
of this part is to get as many ideas as

00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:45,590
possible and this can be really

00:18:41,899 --> 00:18:48,080
difficult m to do so I try and reinforce

00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:50,179
the rules of brainstorming so all ideas

00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:52,850
are equal you know allowed to judge any

00:18:50,179 --> 00:18:55,279
idea you know how to analyze any idea

00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:58,489
and and they shouldn't be realistic or

00:18:55,279 --> 00:18:59,809
feasible or even good at this stage so

00:18:58,489 --> 00:19:01,759
you have to be really careful if you're

00:18:59,809 --> 00:19:04,159
running this workshop if you see someone

00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:08,119
starting to analyze someone else's idea

00:19:04,159 --> 00:19:10,039
um you know to stop there because you

00:19:08,119 --> 00:19:11,899
don't want to have people hold back the

00:19:10,039 --> 00:19:13,309
ideas that they have it's also really

00:19:11,899 --> 00:19:15,139
common for people to criticize their own

00:19:13,309 --> 00:19:16,759
ideas you can kind of see it sometimes

00:19:15,139 --> 00:19:17,989
of people's heads with it about to say

00:19:16,759 --> 00:19:20,330
something and they think no it's stupid

00:19:17,989 --> 00:19:21,590
not good say you got to watch that and

00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:22,999
try and get them to say it anyway

00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:24,789
because this is the area where you

00:19:22,999 --> 00:19:27,769
really want to get every single idea of

00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:29,570
people's heads so there's those

00:19:27,769 --> 00:19:34,460
different ways and techniques of doing

00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:36,320
it and 685 s is a pretty common one and

00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:38,179
this is where you have to create six to

00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:40,940
eight concepts in five minutes which is

00:19:38,179 --> 00:19:43,309
really not enough time to do it well and

00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:45,739
that's kind of the idea is that people

00:19:43,309 --> 00:19:48,710
can't spend too much time on one concept

00:19:45,739 --> 00:19:51,080
they they have to do really roughly

00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:52,970
really quickly and it means that they

00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:54,950
don't get too connected to any one idea

00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:56,600
that they spent a long time on trying to

00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:57,980
make it really detailed and it makes

00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:00,830
them feel like it's easy for them to

00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:02,119
throw away and this then that is really

00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:05,359
important because you don't want people

00:20:02,119 --> 00:20:07,399
to get too attached to one idea so they

00:20:05,359 --> 00:20:08,809
usually look a bit like this it's really

00:20:07,399 --> 00:20:10,309
easy to do something like crazy eights

00:20:08,809 --> 00:20:14,749
by following the paper in half in half

00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:17,419
again enough again you end up with 48

00:20:14,749 --> 00:20:20,629
different sections you can draw in I

00:20:17,419 --> 00:20:21,980
found this like some people really

00:20:20,629 --> 00:20:23,660
struggle with this and end up

00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:25,340
I doing one or two really detailed and

00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:28,160
then not doing the rest in enough time

00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:29,450
and sometimes I just said it so you have

00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:31,750
to do one in a minute and then we'll

00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:34,070
move on and do another one in a minute

00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:35,780
but this is really important because you

00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:38,750
need to get everyone past this first

00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:41,540
idea hump and what this is is there's

00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:43,070
there's always someone there who has

00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:45,679
this idea that's been in their head you

00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:46,850
know like for a couple of days and it's

00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:47,900
been brewing in there and they've kind

00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:49,070
of thought about it for a while and they

00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:51,020
convince themselves that this is the

00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:53,179
best idea this is going to solve all the

00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:54,500
problems and this can be really

00:20:53,179 --> 00:20:56,150
dangerous in this situation where you

00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:59,360
want all ideas to be equal and you want

00:20:56,150 --> 00:21:01,400
to explore these different ones they

00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:03,080
also end up being like quite attached to

00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:05,330
that idea and they end up arguing for a

00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:08,510
lot and shooting down other people's

00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:11,090
ideas so you need to keep doing this

00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:15,280
process and keep repeating this this

00:21:11,090 --> 00:21:17,690
idea generation step until you get

00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:19,160
everyone past this first idea that they

00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:20,990
really attached you and they just

00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:23,960
realize that it's just one idea of many

00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:26,059
and then the next thing you need to do

00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:27,410
is present the ideas you have back to

00:21:26,059 --> 00:21:29,240
everyone so you put it up on the wall

00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:30,710
you put them up next to your problem

00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:32,840
statements because then it's really easy

00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:33,919
to point between the two and show how

00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:36,230
you're trying to sell the different

00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:38,240
problems and you skip people to talk

00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:42,320
through their thinking and their intent

00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:47,120
and what they're trying to solve it

00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:49,370
helps to kind of to show people how they

00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:51,169
can like how can they improve better and

00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:53,090
sometimes it helps for people just like

00:21:51,169 --> 00:21:55,010
maybe say I solve this in this way I

00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:56,390
like it I don't like this aspect of it

00:21:55,010 --> 00:21:58,340
so much because it kind of opens up a

00:21:56,390 --> 00:22:00,500
little bit more and it allows people to

00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:01,880
feel like they can start to give

00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:04,400
feedback without thinking about feedback

00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:06,049
and it won't be a big problem because

00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:09,860
none of the ideas at this stage are

00:22:06,049 --> 00:22:12,200
perfect so asked after everyone hasn't

00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:14,870
had a chance to present you can discuss

00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:16,940
what aspects you like which aspects you

00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:19,460
think could be better and this is

00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:21,140
another tricky area because people do

00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:23,330
get naturally attached to some ideas

00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:26,630
that they found they like more than

00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:29,090
others so sometimes it helps to try and

00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:32,900
and I'll super to phrase feedback in a

00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:34,680
certain way like I'm asking like how

00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:36,750
might we do this instead of I

00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:38,340
like this part of it and and sometimes

00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:39,900
you have to just casually by that point

00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:42,480
and say maybe you can rephrase it in a

00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:44,880
slightly different way because I found

00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:46,230
that like if you have people who are

00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,820
very senior and then other people

00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:49,650
throughout the team like egos get

00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:51,180
involved very quickly and you kind of

00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:52,740
have to be careful to watch people who

00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:55,650
like have a very protective of their

00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:57,930
egos and feel like they're being

00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:58,950
attacked quite easily so one of the

00:22:57,930 --> 00:23:00,540
other things i forgot to mention is that

00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:02,460
because you're putting all these on the

00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:04,470
wall and it means that when you're

00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:06,330
critiquing them everyone is standing at

00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:09,120
together on on the other side of the

00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:11,010
wall facing it which is different to

00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:13,110
having someone present and then at that

00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:14,580
point ask people to critique them as

00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:15,750
they're standing up there because it

00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:18,090
feels like they're on you know they are

00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:20,370
being attacked against the wall along

00:23:18,090 --> 00:23:21,720
with their idea if you get people to you

00:23:20,370 --> 00:23:24,000
know step away from the wall and then

00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:27,240
look at it together then it feels a

00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,950
little bit less intimidating one thing

00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:30,420
that I'm a big fan of is silent critique

00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:31,710
and this is a way of making sure that

00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:34,980
everyone has a chance to say something

00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:36,180
before and someone comes in here what

00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:37,830
you don't intend to dominate the

00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:40,020
conversation and I say it's in a way and

00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:41,340
I say this because I used to be that

00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:43,970
kind of person you to dominate all the

00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:47,850
conversations just ours too enthusiastic

00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:50,700
to speak and yeah so this is a good way

00:23:47,850 --> 00:23:52,890
to work you give people stickers and

00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:55,290
maybe five or so stickers and get them

00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:56,220
to go around and put put em the stickers

00:23:55,290 --> 00:23:57,480
on the points that they think are

00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:59,070
interesting or things that they want to

00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:01,080
talk about and then it kind of gives you

00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:03,780
like a priority list of things that are

00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:06,180
important and worth talking about and

00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:07,710
it's a really good way to visualize like

00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:11,070
the things that really tricky or

00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:12,390
difficult or need discussion and it's a

00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:15,900
great way to make sure that everyone has

00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:17,520
had some input at some point yeah at

00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:20,690
that point in you need probably to

00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:23,340
generate even more ideas people tend to

00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:25,020
see another idea and kind of build up I

00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:27,060
want to build off of that or try in a

00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:28,530
different way and it's useful to

00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:30,510
encourage people to kind of take someone

00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:32,700
else's idea and change in another way so

00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:34,170
there's always a rule that you can you

00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:36,060
can steal if you make it your own you

00:24:34,170 --> 00:24:39,360
have to change it in some way and how

00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:41,160
kind of build on that idea and so it's

00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:43,710
kind of down to a judgment on how much

00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:45,690
you will and run that part of the

00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:47,340
workshop for sometimes it feels that

00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:47,740
people have been exhausted of ideas and

00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:48,910
sunday

00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:51,160
to push them just a little bit more to

00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:52,570
make sure they've explored all the areas

00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:54,010
but at some point you have to get to the

00:24:52,570 --> 00:24:56,020
point where you need to decide you know

00:24:54,010 --> 00:24:57,970
you need to reduce the ideas you need to

00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:59,530
come down to an idea that everyone

00:24:57,970 --> 00:25:01,840
agrees is the best one to take forward

00:24:59,530 --> 00:25:04,690
even if it's not necessary the perfect

00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:07,300
one yeah and that's just down to your

00:25:04,690 --> 00:25:09,750
judgment so there's different ways of

00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:12,130
boiling it down into one concepts and

00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:16,540
some of the things I do is I identifying

00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:20,470
conflicts or doing a 3 12 3 which is

00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:23,800
like a longer version of the 68 fives so

00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:26,260
you actually are super to just do a few

00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:28,630
more detail ideas so they have more time

00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:31,090
to spend all the ideas I really AM they

00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:32,500
really think of the best ones and then

00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:33,850
work with those and said at the end up

00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:38,320
being a bit of a combination of some of

00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:41,440
the other ideas you came up with in at

00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:42,490
in a quicker way and i also like allows

00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,020
you to add a little bit more detail

00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:45,730
about how it actually could work in

00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:47,110
practice so if you haven't really

00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:48,640
figured out how this could work on

00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:50,350
different devices it gives you a bit

00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:54,400
more time to kind of explore how that

00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:56,890
would how that would work you can also

00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:58,120
use voting again using stickers you know

00:25:56,890 --> 00:26:00,730
if you're really stuck and you can't

00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:02,580
decide between different concepts and

00:26:00,730 --> 00:26:05,950
just giving people a chance to vote

00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:07,780
really helps and this is an example of

00:26:05,950 --> 00:26:11,500
identifying different conflicts so if

00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:13,510
you see 2m design concepts that try and

00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:15,100
solve the same thing in different ways

00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:16,750
like for example signing up with

00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:18,550
facebook facebook or twitter or email

00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:20,830
you can only choose one of those things

00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:24,460
you can't have you can't have two of

00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:26,080
those options so identifying those

00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:28,780
complex and seeing where they are really

00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:30,640
helps you reduce the number of ideas and

00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:34,290
forcing forces people to pick you know

00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:39,059
which one they think is the best one

00:26:34,290 --> 00:26:42,610
yeah so in in general i found this is

00:26:39,059 --> 00:26:44,530
this process really helped me achieve I

00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:45,910
where I wanted to achieve so it helped

00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:47,380
me get like the consensus based on

00:26:45,910 --> 00:26:49,450
objectives because you have those

00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:52,240
problem statements to find out all the

00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:55,059
research we will have done and you have

00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:57,040
them up on the wall the whole day you

00:26:55,059 --> 00:26:58,480
have buy-in from stakeholders because

00:26:57,040 --> 00:27:00,710
they've been through this entire process

00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:02,870
and they know em

00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:04,039
and they understand all the decisions

00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:06,440
you've made you've done it all together

00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:08,059
I think you have more buying from

00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:09,500
developers as well because they've been

00:27:08,059 --> 00:27:11,090
through this process and they understand

00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:12,770
why you're doing what you're doing and

00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:14,059
they're not just them being handed these

00:27:12,770 --> 00:27:16,070
designs and being told to do them

00:27:14,059 --> 00:27:17,840
without really understanding the context

00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:20,710
around it and I do really believe that

00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:23,330
you end up with better design concepts

00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:24,320
because having a diverse set of people

00:27:23,330 --> 00:27:27,529
in the room with different backgrounds

00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:31,820
and different ideas it really does help

00:27:27,529 --> 00:27:33,529
and generate the best possible designs

00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:36,409
that you can come up with and I've up

00:27:33,529 --> 00:27:37,789
and I found as well but it's about two

00:27:36,409 --> 00:27:39,890
weeks worth of work of like you know

00:27:37,789 --> 00:27:41,809
coming up with a design going back

00:27:39,890 --> 00:27:43,669
getting feedback it's raising going

00:27:41,809 --> 00:27:44,600
around again and you know that something

00:27:43,669 --> 00:27:46,279
that could take two weeks you can

00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:49,820
actually do like in about six hours and

00:27:46,279 --> 00:27:51,799
one day by doing it all together and

00:27:49,820 --> 00:28:02,240
that's everything I have to say thank

00:27:51,799 --> 00:28:04,640
you I am I usually have done this

00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:06,500
session i usually get loads of questions

00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:08,299
from people or loads of like comments

00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:11,120
about ways they've sold those kind of

00:28:08,299 --> 00:28:13,190
problem so I left loads of time for

00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:15,350
discussion or questions does anyone have

00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:17,299
any any questions they have or any

00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:18,880
suggestions or advice about ways they've

00:28:17,299 --> 00:28:23,080
handled those problems in different ways

00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:23,080
yes would you mind using the mic

00:28:34,629 --> 00:28:41,000
yeah just got a question and do you have

00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:43,279
any issues with you know apples there's

00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:45,769
a high-speed people's opinions because I

00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:47,389
mean I've done similar types of concepts

00:28:45,769 --> 00:28:49,490
with these these kind of workshops and

00:28:47,389 --> 00:28:50,690
let me spend a day with people and

00:28:49,490 --> 00:28:53,450
everyone comes up with ideas but you get

00:28:50,690 --> 00:28:56,570
one person that's just absolutely fixed

00:28:53,450 --> 00:28:58,519
that their opinion is you know by far

00:28:56,570 --> 00:29:00,379
away you know they're it's their project

00:28:58,519 --> 00:29:02,149
and I've heard people describe projects

00:29:00,379 --> 00:29:04,460
in that way that is like it's their

00:29:02,149 --> 00:29:07,070
personal project it's like a people in a

00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:08,720
room I mean you have any sort of advice

00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:11,120
on how to how to shift those kind of

00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:14,120
pennies on her break those yeah right um

00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:16,850
yeah the hippo the highest-paid person's

00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:18,259
opinion and it's it's a problem in all

00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:22,370
kinds of workshops now you get it and

00:29:18,259 --> 00:29:24,200
all the time and it's is I guess it's

00:29:22,370 --> 00:29:25,850
more like a question of skill of being

00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:28,190
able to communicate with that person

00:29:25,850 --> 00:29:30,230
then it is about you know in any quick

00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:31,850
tip that you can give someone and but

00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:34,460
I've often found that people who tend to

00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:35,720
keep repeating their opinion again again

00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:37,759
it's because I don't really feel like

00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:38,929
they're being listened to and they feel

00:29:37,759 --> 00:29:39,950
like people which want to move on and do

00:29:38,929 --> 00:29:41,840
something else so they feel like I have

00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:44,840
to keep repeating it I'm just like I

00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:47,210
found is that even if it takes like 5 or

00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:48,649
10 or 15 minutes just to focus on that

00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:50,929
person and give them the chance to get

00:29:48,649 --> 00:29:52,460
all that stuff out and maybe get it

00:29:50,929 --> 00:29:53,480
written down or try and get up on the

00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:55,220
wall because and they feel like they've

00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:57,649
been listened to and sometimes they tend

00:29:55,220 --> 00:30:01,940
to to take a bit more of a Banksy after

00:29:57,649 --> 00:30:04,039
that um that helps em in some situations

00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:07,100
but if people are really really

00:30:04,039 --> 00:30:08,480
insistent on their em on their opinion

00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:10,009
you know I'm making their decision and

00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:12,799
everyone following like what they think

00:30:10,009 --> 00:30:14,539
is the best idea and I usually find that

00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:17,000
you have to kind of take your role as

00:30:14,539 --> 00:30:19,399
the facilitator and try and like be firm

00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,840
because at the end day that is your role

00:30:19,399 --> 00:30:22,039
bearing adaeze your job and usually I

00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:23,720
used as a thing being that I'm just

00:30:22,039 --> 00:30:25,309
doing my job you know the rules of the

00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:26,750
workshop are that we have to give other

00:30:25,309 --> 00:30:28,549
people a chance to give their opinions

00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:30,049
as well and it's less of an attack on

00:30:28,549 --> 00:30:31,610
them because you're just saying one just

00:30:30,049 --> 00:30:33,740
do my job you know this is just part of

00:30:31,610 --> 00:30:37,309
my role at the moment this is an attack

00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:39,470
on your ideas or your role and like that

00:30:37,309 --> 00:30:40,940
that helps a bit as well but like I said

00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:41,090
it's like it's tricky thing really at

00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:42,830
the

00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:44,660
you can probably spend years learning

00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:47,510
how to communicate with those people and

00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:49,400
maybe not even get anywhere but I yeah

00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:51,560
it's more about learning like life

00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:55,090
skills and communication I think there

00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:55,090
is any workshop technique

00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:12,250
how'd you get buy-in from clients to

00:31:10,150 --> 00:31:14,980
have that many people in the room for a

00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:16,510
whole day when they're busy people they

00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:18,610
do want to be involved they won't have

00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:21,610
their opinion but they giving up a full

00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:23,200
day for maybe a group of six eight ten

00:31:21,610 --> 00:31:24,640
not how many people you tend to have in

00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,920
these things but quite quite a few

00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:28,960
people in terms of stakeholders and

00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:30,820
product owners and how can you actually

00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:32,170
sell that to them when they're when they

00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:34,180
say that you know we've only got an hour

00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:35,920
or we've only got two hours yeah you're

00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:38,410
right and yeah that's very difficult to

00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:39,580
be able to convince them that they can

00:31:38,410 --> 00:31:42,100
use that time I like that because it's

00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:45,460
such a you know such a tough resource to

00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:49,360
get from stakeholders and usually like

00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:52,510
the other thing it's quite um restricted

00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:54,670
is the budget so we tend to advise it

00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:56,410
and that way saying if you spend this

00:31:54,670 --> 00:31:58,360
day with us we can get through saying

00:31:56,410 --> 00:32:02,740
that you could pay us to do in about two

00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:04,179
weeks instead and that helps a bit that

00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:06,400
usually does convince people a little

00:32:04,179 --> 00:32:07,420
bit because usually that's the budget is

00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:10,270
something that can be moot you know

00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:11,980
their company moved at all em but their

00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:16,300
time is a little bit more flexible than

00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:18,760
that apart from that and we've tried

00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:21,220
doing things like just selling them a

00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:23,410
workshop like this or just sewing the

00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:26,740
idea of doing like a week-long sprint

00:32:23,410 --> 00:32:28,300
instead of signing a contract to do like

00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:29,740
you know months and months long project

00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:31,840
to kind of get a taste for how this

00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:34,120
process works and then the risk in that

00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:35,530
case financially is quite low so

00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:37,840
sometimes it's easier to convince them

00:32:35,530 --> 00:32:39,130
to start with that and if if they feel

00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:40,900
like you know it's making good progress

00:32:39,130 --> 00:32:43,450
and they feel like it's more productive

00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:44,530
then then they can choose to move

00:32:43,450 --> 00:32:47,410
forward and take a little bit more

00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:48,970
financial risk and that works quite well

00:32:47,410 --> 00:32:50,500
just you know giving being a good

00:32:48,970 --> 00:32:52,300
introduction a good taste it to how we

00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:54,970
work and the way we do it because it's

00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:56,530
it's hard to like people are quite used

00:32:54,970 --> 00:32:59,260
to the ways that we used to design your

00:32:56,530 --> 00:33:00,610
way you just you know do a mock-up and

00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:02,740
show them and they'll be like yeah okay

00:33:00,610 --> 00:33:04,059
we'll buy this now now we'll figure out

00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:06,540
how to build it later you know a lot of

00:33:04,059 --> 00:33:09,280
clients are used to that process still

00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:11,559
so it helps to have some something small

00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:13,510
like Senate you could do hoping up for

00:33:11,559 --> 00:33:15,070
free but you know for a like for very

00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:16,570
low risk to them to kind of give them an

00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:18,360
introduction to why it's better to do it

00:33:16,570 --> 00:33:21,790
in this way

00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:24,790
thanks I've got another question on no

00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:26,890
one minds it seems like at the end of

00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:29,110
that process you're coming up with sort

00:33:26,890 --> 00:33:31,060
of mainly kind of wireframes and a kind

00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:34,420
of agreed direction on wire frames with

00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:36,780
particular sort of UX issues or journeys

00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:39,910
through that what happens next and how

00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:43,360
quickly do you get into Colors Fund

00:33:39,910 --> 00:33:45,220
actual design you know that high are you

00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:47,110
going to the visual design level next or

00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:49,810
is it mainly about getting agreement on

00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:51,400
on sort of you access you yeah and so

00:33:49,810 --> 00:33:53,020
what you do next to this design concept

00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:54,490
once you're out the workshop really

00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:58,900
depends on the context of the project

00:33:54,490 --> 00:34:00,190
and if you and follow the design sprint

00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:03,340
methodology and if you read that book

00:34:00,190 --> 00:34:05,110
and that is focused on solving like

00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:06,550
really big high-level problems like is

00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:10,360
this even a thing that people want to

00:34:06,550 --> 00:34:11,890
buy and and it's not um it's not really

00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:13,810
focusing on the small details it's kind

00:34:11,890 --> 00:34:16,060
of about getting to something you can

00:34:13,810 --> 00:34:17,740
use and prototype and learn with really

00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:19,419
quickly but that's not true of every

00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:21,100
project you know some clients have

00:34:19,419 --> 00:34:22,900
absolutely exists already they have a

00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:25,690
stable business they understand the

00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:29,140
needs of the users more or less and in

00:34:25,690 --> 00:34:30,970
that situation um it's about taking like

00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:32,590
that solution that you've come up

00:34:30,970 --> 00:34:33,910
without the workshop and getting it like

00:34:32,590 --> 00:34:35,710
to a point where you can learn from it

00:34:33,910 --> 00:34:40,270
really quickly so it really does depend

00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:42,940
I probably I probably would use it like

00:34:40,270 --> 00:34:44,679
at the very earliest stage when you're

00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:47,020
probably not going to move to visual

00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:49,270
design straightaway you're going to

00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:50,800
maybe do some testing with the concert

00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:52,330
you come out with and have a chance to

00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:54,460
learn with it now I think it's better

00:34:52,330 --> 00:34:57,160
that stage because you're still kind of

00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:59,260
adjusting every possible solution you

00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:01,090
can probably have and going straight to

00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:03,220
the point where you're polishing that

00:35:01,090 --> 00:35:04,570
and assuming it's good it's probably

00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:07,150
it's probably a bit too early in that

00:35:04,570 --> 00:35:09,400
stage so i think we probably take it

00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:10,900
through testing after that just to make

00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:13,990
sure that the things that we assume i

00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:15,580
right Mr actually correct so it strikes

00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:16,840
me that there's potentially still a bit

00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:20,710
of their kind of going into your cave

00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:22,840
and doing some more detailed higher

00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:24,730
fidelity designs to then actually get

00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:25,720
approval from the stakeholders and sign

00:35:24,730 --> 00:35:27,280
off and so they're still a bit of that

00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:28,359
process after that just less because

00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:30,309
they've had more

00:35:28,359 --> 00:35:31,569
yeah involvement in the beginning yeah

00:35:30,309 --> 00:35:34,420
that's right so the visual design

00:35:31,569 --> 00:35:35,920
process I there is no way I found to do

00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:37,900
that in a in a collaborative way like

00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:41,529
you would drawing and sketching because

00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:43,119
it is pretty subjective but I found that

00:35:41,529 --> 00:35:45,160
if you make the big decisions early on

00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:46,359
like like how this is actually going to

00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:48,039
work how is this going to flow together

00:35:46,359 --> 00:35:50,109
what's going to be on the page then

00:35:48,039 --> 00:35:52,749
you've removed a lot of the conversation

00:35:50,109 --> 00:35:54,039
that comes afterwards and I found that I

00:35:52,749 --> 00:35:57,130
still have to go back to the old

00:35:54,039 --> 00:35:59,259
techniques of I of kind of introducing

00:35:57,130 --> 00:36:00,609
and reminding people of the objectives

00:35:59,259 --> 00:36:02,230
you have for visual design that's what

00:36:00,609 --> 00:36:05,099
we're going for this or we did last

00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:07,900
meeting and keeping that flowing and

00:36:05,099 --> 00:36:09,309
keeping like people were like reminding

00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:11,680
people about what the objects of the

00:36:09,309 --> 00:36:18,970
visual design was and what we've already

00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:20,499
agreed upon thank you does anyone else

00:36:18,970 --> 00:36:23,369
have any questions or you can talk to me

00:36:20,499 --> 00:36:23,369
afterwards is fine

00:36:31,089 --> 00:36:37,719
and yeah I'm a firm believer in like

00:36:35,349 --> 00:36:39,579
data driven design and using as much

00:36:37,719 --> 00:36:41,789
data beforehand and gather as much data

00:36:39,579 --> 00:36:44,589
beforehand and using those to inform

00:36:41,789 --> 00:36:47,589
design decisions and doom development

00:36:44,589 --> 00:36:50,349
decisions and do you use that and the

00:36:47,589 --> 00:36:51,849
workshop space and how do you

00:36:50,349 --> 00:36:54,309
incorporate that into the sort of

00:36:51,849 --> 00:36:57,249
workshop idea or do you just kind of

00:36:54,309 --> 00:36:59,710
just spit ball you know without looking

00:36:57,249 --> 00:37:01,329
at sort of deer before handle oh no you

00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:03,339
definitely would and in that situation

00:37:01,329 --> 00:37:05,019
that's saying that you would represent

00:37:03,339 --> 00:37:07,180
people right at the beginning the

00:37:05,019 --> 00:37:10,210
understanding phase of it so if you have

00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:11,469
a go it helps to prepare like the

00:37:10,210 --> 00:37:12,729
information that you have the data

00:37:11,469 --> 00:37:15,549
you've collected in design is really

00:37:12,729 --> 00:37:17,140
digestible so when I do that with user

00:37:15,549 --> 00:37:19,299
testing then you kind of summarize the

00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:20,829
main problems that were found and you

00:37:19,299 --> 00:37:22,660
pull out some highlights from the videos

00:37:20,829 --> 00:37:24,400
if you need to it'll be the same thing

00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:25,719
with the data you've collected so just

00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:27,400
being able to give people really quick

00:37:25,719 --> 00:37:28,799
summary and doing their preparation in

00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:31,630
advance of the workshop to kind of and

00:37:28,799 --> 00:37:33,819
communicate the key issues you found two

00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:35,289
people and that's a really important

00:37:33,819 --> 00:37:36,670
part to do right at the beginning so

00:37:35,289 --> 00:37:37,869
people kind they have the same

00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:39,579
assumptions and they have the same

00:37:37,869 --> 00:37:44,579
knowledge so they kind of understand

00:37:39,579 --> 00:37:44,579
where everyone else is coming from okay

00:37:46,259 --> 00:37:50,440
great okay well like I said you can

00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:53,529
contact me any point joined rubicon or

00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:56,969
at a pub somewhere and all right now and

00:37:53,529 --> 00:37:56,969
the things are listening

00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:02,770
