all right well I guess we'll start hi my

00:00:03,149 --> 00:00:06,210
name is David Wong I'm the least

00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:09,120
relevant person in this in that all i

00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:10,860
did was submit the the d dot o session

00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,570
submission the people who are going to

00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:13,799
speak today there are six people who are

00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:16,080
going to speak about impostor syndrome

00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:18,330
actually a quick question how many

00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:21,510
people here have heard of or understand

00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:22,890
what impostor syndrome is perfect okay

00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:25,980
great okay well skip the the

00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:28,800
introductory part that so we'll have six

00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:30,689
folks they'll be speaking individually

00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,399
about their experiences with it and then

00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:36,210
we'll have a question and answer session

00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:38,399
at the end so the six folks who are

00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:40,379
speaking and yes it was intentionally

00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,180
obscured in the in the write-up so

00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:44,460
apologies if it was kind of a mystery

00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:49,230
Megan sanic 'i the executive director of

00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:51,860
the drupal association gabbar hoi chi Mr

00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:55,920
curry I am I always get your name wrong

00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:59,309
Kerry Anna's Cathy days Ryan's Rama and

00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:02,449
Angie Byron so we'll start with Megan

00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:02,449
thanks for coming everybody

00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:15,039
hi everyone well I'm here to bare my

00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:16,960
soul and can you raise your hand if

00:01:15,039 --> 00:01:18,520
you've ever watched the TED talk by

00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:22,090
brené Brown called the power of

00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:25,659
vulnerability a few of you alright so

00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:29,049
she's basically a social scientist who

00:01:25,659 --> 00:01:33,549
does research on on what vulnerability

00:01:29,049 --> 00:01:36,299
and shame and and and lots of really

00:01:33,549 --> 00:01:39,130
those messy feelings that we have and

00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:40,840
she she goes into a lot of research

00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:42,579
about the power of exposing those

00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:44,349
feelings and how by putting the

00:01:42,579 --> 00:01:47,890
flashlight there you get a lot stronger

00:01:44,349 --> 00:01:49,239
so hopefully mmm that's one of the

00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:51,280
things that we can help with today I

00:01:49,239 --> 00:01:52,810
think just shining a light on impostor

00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,099
syndrome and any kind of mental health

00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:56,649
as just holding you back is really

00:01:54,099 --> 00:01:58,659
important and hopefully it starts a

00:01:56,649 --> 00:02:04,719
dialogue so here's a little bit of my

00:01:58,659 --> 00:02:08,640
story so I joined the Association six

00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:11,380
years ago I was the first employee

00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:14,350
helped build it to what it is today

00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:17,019
working with executive directors and the

00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:19,540
board built many of the programs I don't

00:02:17,019 --> 00:02:23,349
code so i did not do drupal.org or you

00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:27,700
know the tooling but definitely helped

00:02:23,349 --> 00:02:32,410
raise all the money for that and we we

00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:34,180
had a change in June and Drees asked if

00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:39,040
I would step in and be the executive

00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:43,329
director in hollyrock zech you tyvek tur

00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:46,150
she had named me as like the number two

00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:47,889
in case you got hit by a bus and so she

00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:49,030
even mentored me and always made sure I

00:02:47,889 --> 00:02:50,859
was involved in all the big

00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:53,290
conversations and the special board

00:02:50,859 --> 00:02:57,430
retreats so so certainly groom for the

00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:59,650
position but you know is it's a big step

00:02:57,430 --> 00:03:02,500
to go from the CEO position to the

00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:05,319
executive director role and in short I

00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:08,829
was really anxious and not really sure

00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:10,329
if I could take that step so I had lots

00:03:08,829 --> 00:03:13,510
of questions of like could I really do

00:03:10,329 --> 00:03:16,319
this job and then of course you know

00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:19,499
staff and community really love Holly

00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:22,079
and.and I love Holly too so you kind of

00:03:19,499 --> 00:03:25,109
wonder like it might you know will I

00:03:22,079 --> 00:03:27,810
stack up and really step into this role

00:03:25,109 --> 00:03:29,760
in the way that she did so you have all

00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:33,230
these kinds of questions and it's

00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:35,790
certainly you know really overwhelming

00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:37,859
it's especially overwhelming just as a

00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:40,469
side note I have chronic anxiety which

00:03:37,859 --> 00:03:41,730
is just a simple disorder type of thing

00:03:40,469 --> 00:03:43,889
I guess you'd call it disorder but it

00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:45,540
just means you're like always twitchy so

00:03:43,889 --> 00:03:48,359
I just go through life always twitchy

00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:51,870
but laughing at the same time so that's

00:03:48,359 --> 00:03:52,919
not anything we need to really get into

00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:58,409
today but I could be a whole nother

00:03:52,919 --> 00:04:00,810
topic anyhow i will say that i have

00:03:58,409 --> 00:04:02,760
these feelings they come up all the time

00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:04,650
i think they come up for everyone all

00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:06,090
the time i think that's natural but i

00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:07,829
just want to use the rest of my time

00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:09,209
just to talk about what I do because I

00:04:07,829 --> 00:04:12,870
think it's important to have tips and

00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:15,870
coping skills so just one thing is I

00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:17,039
have mentors and I had a boss who once

00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:19,199
said if you're not scared you're not

00:04:17,039 --> 00:04:22,409
growing so it's kind of like embrace

00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:24,300
embrace those feelings and this is a

00:04:22,409 --> 00:04:25,620
funny one from Richard Branson I mean I

00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:27,720
don't know how many people get

00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:29,009
inspiration from him but he said if

00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:31,199
someone offers you an amazing

00:04:29,009 --> 00:04:34,080
opportunity and you're not sure you can

00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:36,710
do it just say yes then learn how to do

00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:39,300
it and that resonated with me because

00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:40,590
sometimes I've held myself back and just

00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:42,120
I got to a point where I was tired of

00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:45,750
holding myself back because of these

00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:46,949
feelings and then I also rely on grit de

00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:48,330
Ruiz talked about that's a lot of

00:04:46,949 --> 00:04:50,970
research coming out of university of

00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:52,830
pennsylvania right now the research says

00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:55,110
we don't know how to teach anyone grit

00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:57,570
but i can say my mom just always said

00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:59,880
suck it up and nike says just do it and

00:04:57,570 --> 00:05:03,719
that's what i was raised with so I kind

00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:06,930
of lean into that and then on the more

00:05:03,719 --> 00:05:09,449
softer side I also rely on mindfulness

00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:10,740
or positive psychology which is research

00:05:09,449 --> 00:05:12,960
is coming out of university of

00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:14,729
pennsylvania as well and so there's just

00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:17,550
a lot of tips of learning how to pause

00:05:14,729 --> 00:05:20,340
and breathe and except where you are in

00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:22,229
the feelings that you have and then to

00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:23,880
be able to come up with a plan from

00:05:22,229 --> 00:05:26,789
there once you're kind of like you know

00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:28,449
centered again and then the other thing

00:05:26,789 --> 00:05:29,559
is to talk you have to talk

00:05:28,449 --> 00:05:31,659
these things out if you have these

00:05:29,559 --> 00:05:33,400
feelings because you're you don't need

00:05:31,659 --> 00:05:35,860
to figure this out alone and usually

00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:38,680
just talking about it just helps you

00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:41,139
move forward as well and then lastly i'm

00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:43,629
just an operational person by nature so

00:05:41,139 --> 00:05:46,050
make a plan right you have a plan you

00:05:43,629 --> 00:06:00,900
stick to it you can do anything so

00:05:46,050 --> 00:06:04,599
anyhow that's my story and my tips hi

00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:08,080
I'm Gabrielle high tree I work for aquia

00:06:04,599 --> 00:06:12,819
for nine years I work with Drupal for 13

00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:15,539
years and when I was asked to tell a

00:06:12,819 --> 00:06:18,999
story I had a hard time picking one

00:06:15,539 --> 00:06:22,300
because there's a lot of them so um so I

00:06:18,999 --> 00:06:26,589
decided to pick a big a dream that I

00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:29,020
have or you would say a nightmare that I

00:06:26,589 --> 00:06:31,509
have and that reaches back to my high

00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:36,729
school years and is actually very very

00:06:31,509 --> 00:06:39,399
very relevant today so when I was in

00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:42,039
high school I started out I think as a

00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:44,800
mediocre student at the start I've had

00:06:42,039 --> 00:06:46,930
sort of okay grades so in Hungary your

00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:50,949
graded from one to five and I had threes

00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:52,719
or fours it was ok I was fine and I

00:06:50,949 --> 00:06:56,550
started doing a lot of community things

00:06:52,719 --> 00:06:59,289
so I was organizing freshman camp I was

00:06:56,550 --> 00:07:01,629
working at the school newspaper a lot of

00:06:59,289 --> 00:07:03,819
other interesting things and migrated

00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:06,879
started to reach up and they were like

00:07:03,819 --> 00:07:09,909
fours and fives and I always thought

00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:11,919
that my chemistry teacher was seeing the

00:07:09,909 --> 00:07:15,099
true me because she was giving me threes

00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:17,080
and I was like yes she's she's seeing

00:07:15,099 --> 00:07:19,479
what I'm doing and the rest are really

00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:21,550
mostly probably just grading me well

00:07:19,479 --> 00:07:23,949
because I'm this well-known person and

00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:26,999
if the guy is doing so much in the

00:07:23,949 --> 00:07:30,310
school he must be learning well as well

00:07:26,999 --> 00:07:32,550
and I was ignoring some of these things

00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:35,709
things so much that when i went to the

00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:38,379
graduation exams at high school I

00:07:35,709 --> 00:07:41,409
totally forget to shave so I was those

00:07:38,379 --> 00:07:41,860
strange and and then I went on and then

00:07:41,409 --> 00:07:44,199
I fin

00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:46,210
University I've had a lot of interesting

00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:50,919
stories there but even after finishing

00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:54,069
University these dreams started to came

00:07:50,919 --> 00:07:57,069
to me whenever I've had had something

00:07:54,069 --> 00:07:59,500
big to do like go to a new conference

00:07:57,069 --> 00:08:03,909
and do a totally talk or organize a

00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:05,889
conference or or make some big change in

00:08:03,909 --> 00:08:09,400
life that's something that I that I was

00:08:05,889 --> 00:08:11,830
struggling to figure out how then my

00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:15,129
dream started responding in interesting

00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:20,139
ways so so the recurring dream that I

00:08:15,129 --> 00:08:22,150
have recurring nightmare is that people

00:08:20,139 --> 00:08:25,629
going to figure out that I have a

00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:28,659
master's degree in university but I

00:08:25,629 --> 00:08:32,140
never finished high school that I

00:08:28,659 --> 00:08:35,680
somehow need to get back and finish high

00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:37,300
school so that I have some way to prove

00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:40,810
that there was something that I base my

00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:43,360
master's degree on so that they're so

00:08:40,810 --> 00:08:45,850
that so that people didn't just believe

00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:50,350
that I managed to do this but I actually

00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:52,300
managed to do this and I have this I had

00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:55,240
this dream for years and it didn't occur

00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:58,949
in the past few years so I don't know if

00:08:55,240 --> 00:09:02,110
it's over yet or not you never know but

00:08:58,949 --> 00:09:07,029
but it's been always the same thing and

00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:08,920
I was always always strangely intrigued

00:09:07,029 --> 00:09:10,870
to try to figure that out and I read

00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:13,990
about impostor syndrome later on and

00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:16,750
that really resonated with this thing is

00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:20,860
that ok so I'm actually thinking that

00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:22,720
that I that there's the the the people

00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:24,399
believed that I achieved something that

00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,470
I don't believe myself that I actually

00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:29,320
achieved and that's kind of a repeating

00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:31,930
thing that comes back to me all the time

00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:34,300
and I don't think I I managed to get

00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:36,399
over it in any way so a couple months

00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:40,120
ago I was presenting at wordcamp in

00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:41,890
Vienna and I've been speaking in English

00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:43,990
which is a foreign language to me for

00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:46,510
like 15 years and I organized

00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:48,519
conferences for for 12 years and I did a

00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:51,760
lot of stuff and I was presenting at a

00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:53,360
word press event and for the whole day

00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:55,250
before I was

00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:58,279
like talking to myself that I shouldn't

00:09:55,250 --> 00:10:01,190
even be there and my heart pounded I got

00:09:58,279 --> 00:10:03,019
on stage and I was totally nerve-racked

00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:05,630
and the only thing that saved me is

00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:08,600
there was like 30 people in the audience

00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:10,610
and then I started with yeah I'm the

00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:13,760
Drupal guy at the word press event and

00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:16,790
please forgive me so we started up

00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:19,220
joking and I got the gut the nerves down

00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:24,370
but I don't think this is something that

00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:27,290
you can get out of at least not for me

00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:30,620
it is something that you can try to

00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:33,260
ignore and try to somehow get over it

00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:36,940
for the moment and once you jump off the

00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:39,800
point that you didn't want to go over

00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:41,690
because of your anxieties then then

00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:45,019
you'll just recognize that you may be

00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:47,810
capable of doing more than you than what

00:10:45,019 --> 00:11:01,430
you originally thought of so that's my

00:10:47,810 --> 00:11:04,610
story hello ok so I'm Emma carry honest

00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:08,990
i work at tez global in UK and i am

00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:11,300
currently a core maintainer drupal 8

00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:13,130
core maintainer i am part of the

00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:14,930
community working group and i am the

00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:17,779
track lead for this track or the

00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:23,810
sessions in so very glad to be part of

00:11:17,779 --> 00:11:26,360
this so confession I have doubts every

00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:29,269
day like to this day that I am not good

00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:32,720
enough to be contributing to Drupal on

00:11:29,269 --> 00:11:35,120
the technical side so the sprint room is

00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:40,209
a very very very very scary place to me

00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:46,029
I went there yesterday it was fine oh

00:11:40,209 --> 00:11:48,920
yes I started contributing to Drupal in

00:11:46,029 --> 00:11:51,459
2013 that's what I tell people when I

00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:57,260
stand up here but realistically it was

00:11:51,459 --> 00:12:02,140
2012 but it took a whole year for me to

00:11:57,260 --> 00:12:04,910
overcome just my fears my worries just

00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:07,460
accepting that I could be part of it and

00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:09,680
and I have a valid contribution amongst

00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:13,150
everyone else in the room so I basically

00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:15,320
just spend a lot of time saying nothing

00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:18,290
comparing myself to others like there

00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:20,750
are such clever amazing people in the

00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:23,720
Drupal community and I just thought

00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:28,730
right okay that level is up here and I'm

00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:32,090
lying here so yeah and I just took it

00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:36,170
out myself far too much and I also try

00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:38,570
to be something I'm not I thought I had

00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:40,850
to be like this bigshot PHP developer

00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:43,400
and I was just this junior developer who

00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:45,950
did front end and I thought there was

00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:47,450
nothing I could do so this went on for a

00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:49,790
while and then I had this realization

00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:51,470
that this is not healthy I'm a

00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:55,670
completely different person I'm very

00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:58,940
loud and silly and open and honest and I

00:12:55,670 --> 00:13:03,200
was just a frozen horrible like it was

00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:05,270
not fun so what did i do about this I

00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:09,640
still do this every day like I said like

00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:12,980
I did it yesterday i use my strengths so

00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:16,370
my big staff is just being honest about

00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:17,810
it I went around to nearly everyone

00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:20,150
everyone who I consider my mentor

00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:23,270
everyone who smiled at me when I'm

00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:26,510
freaking out about this I mean I want to

00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:28,580
paddle with like lots of my mentors and

00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:31,520
people I look up to and there's just me

00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:33,230
and they're like but you have such valid

00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:35,780
contributions you do all these things

00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:38,020
you come up you stand on stage regularly

00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:40,340
and speak about your fears and how you

00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:42,080
got over things and how you achieve

00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:45,710
really small things I was like oh this

00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:49,280
is this is okay um and I try to do

00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:51,740
things that scare me so if I hadn't have

00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:53,990
stood up on stage I think two years ago

00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:55,640
and just spoke about a common respect

00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:57,350
but it was contribution again and how I

00:13:55,640 --> 00:14:00,260
got into it if I didn't done that I

00:13:57,350 --> 00:14:01,520
haven't dude Oh possible words if I

00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:02,780
didn't do any of these things I wouldn't

00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:05,120
be here now and it wouldn't be the

00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:08,720
person I am today so I always do things

00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:13,430
that scare me and I let the real me out

00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:14,990
and also I took my demons that I had so

00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:16,580
impostor syndrome for

00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:19,430
you're good enough thing terrified I

00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:21,080
like to Sola fide it it's I will tweet

00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:23,270
the picture that I drew afterwards that

00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:25,670
completely capsulate what my demon is

00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:27,980
but this big dark looming person behind

00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:29,450
me is just like you shouldn't be here

00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:31,580
you shouldn't be doing this you

00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:34,370
shouldn't be standing on stage like all

00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:36,290
these things and I just basically just

00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:38,029
do things that I know will annoy it

00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:39,589
because right now it's like heading out

00:14:38,029 --> 00:14:42,380
the door because I'm standing here and

00:14:39,589 --> 00:14:46,220
showing it up so that's another thing

00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:47,839
they do and I just accepted that things

00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:49,820
like this will always like you were

00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:52,070
encounter every day I've said that many

00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:53,690
times but yesterday I was a mess and

00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:58,220
today I woke up and I was like it'll be

00:14:53,690 --> 00:15:01,029
fine and I think that's it I'll say

00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:01,029
thank you for coming

00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:25,420
hi I'm Kathy things um I like to try

00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:27,700
doing new things I really like learning

00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:32,080
new things and I really like working

00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:37,840
with other people and when I'm about to

00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:40,630
try and do something new I have no idea

00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:44,010
what it entails and I and I don't know

00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:48,490
how the experts that I look up to

00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:50,980
actually do it so what I'll do is I'll

00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:52,690
lurk for a while so I'll think oh I'd

00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:54,990
really like to try this thing and so

00:15:52,690 --> 00:16:00,280
I'll try and watch other people do it

00:15:54,990 --> 00:16:04,150
without them seeing me and what really

00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:07,180
helps me is when I see those people that

00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:11,290
I admire that I'm lurking watching them

00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:13,600
when I see them make mistakes I get to

00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:16,360
see how they handle those mistakes and

00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:19,150
also how the people they're working with

00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:26,950
respond when somebody makes a mistake

00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:30,760
and those like the ability to do that

00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:34,900
helps me kind of prepare and say to

00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:37,540
myself well if the person I admire the

00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:40,300
way they do they're fantastic work is by

00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:41,770
making mistakes then surely I can do

00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:45,910
that too because I'm really good at

00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:51,310
making mistakes I find that the way that

00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:54,700
people respond to mistakes um can can

00:16:51,310 --> 00:17:01,420
really help other people have courage

00:16:54,700 --> 00:17:03,400
and when I take the first steps to try

00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:07,150
and do something often my first steps

00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:10,150
are questions like I don't understand

00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:13,120
what's going on here or how do I do this

00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:15,220
I'm trying to do that and the way that

00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:16,630
other people respond to me when I asked

00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:20,260
questions can really make a big

00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:22,420
difference in what happens to me next so

00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:26,170
when people respond to me with something

00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:26,720
like that's a good question it helps me

00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:31,510
feel like I

00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:34,070
not a complete idiot and when I asked a

00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:37,760
question about something and they

00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:40,309
respond with oh wow yeah that's a bug we

00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:42,409
should fix that it makes me feel like oh

00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:44,539
so it's not that I just couldn't figure

00:17:42,409 --> 00:17:47,950
out how to get this to work but there's

00:17:44,539 --> 00:17:51,380
an actual problem in the project and

00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:57,700
having people respond to questions in

00:17:51,380 --> 00:18:00,950
that way is is really helpful for me and

00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:02,570
like that's you know I'm talking about

00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:06,350
something kind of specific there but I

00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:08,270
find that I get afraid a lot and that I

00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:11,000
worried that I won't be able to do

00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:12,559
things and when I when it gets to the

00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:17,390
point where it's stopping me from doing

00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:22,789
anything at all I remember when I think

00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:25,580
I heard Angie say and that is a matra

00:18:22,789 --> 00:18:30,549
that I repeat to myself and it's fail

00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:30,549
early fail often and fail in public and

00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:36,200
because it comes from somebody that I've

00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:38,480
you that I admire and that I want to

00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:41,870
emulate that I find that that really

00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:43,700
helps me move through that that part

00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:48,080
where I get stuck and like no no no

00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:50,000
Angie says just fail and I'm like yeah I

00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:53,169
can fail I can do that and so that's

00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,169
kind of how I get through it

00:19:10,789 --> 00:19:18,090
hello i'm ryan drama from commerce guys

00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:20,610
previously the developer of uber cart

00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:22,649
and then of drupal commerce and now I

00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:27,029
engineer a team of people to do things

00:19:22,649 --> 00:19:29,850
instead of writing code myself and one

00:19:27,029 --> 00:19:33,269
of my favorite places in the world is

00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:35,580
notre Dom has anybody been there yeah a

00:19:33,269 --> 00:19:37,919
lot of us have every time I visit Paris

00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:39,360
I make sure to stop by I'm a religious

00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:41,369
person I'm not Catholic but I like to

00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:43,499
sit there doing the you know the evening

00:19:41,369 --> 00:19:45,149
services smell the incense hear the

00:19:43,499 --> 00:19:48,600
music that I can't understand it all and

00:19:45,149 --> 00:19:50,429
I just meditate myself I'm well I guess

00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:51,450
the folks trail in to look around or

00:19:50,429 --> 00:19:53,460
worship it's really kind of a weird

00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:55,559
thing because you're you're worshipping

00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:57,539
and then people are just sort of milling

00:19:55,559 --> 00:19:59,369
about and kind of you know maybe buying

00:19:57,539 --> 00:20:01,529
things or lighting candles or whatever

00:19:59,369 --> 00:20:05,249
it is that you do I've always been

00:20:01,529 --> 00:20:08,159
religious and I remember really

00:20:05,249 --> 00:20:11,460
distinctly as a teenager a pastor that

00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:13,559
I've respected who thought I guess he

00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:15,929
had the handle on god and his

00:20:13,559 --> 00:20:17,369
motivations said to me I don't

00:20:15,929 --> 00:20:20,249
understand Ron why it is that you always

00:20:17,369 --> 00:20:23,669
doubt God I guess that's just your way

00:20:20,249 --> 00:20:28,470
or just who you are and that was really

00:20:23,669 --> 00:20:31,289
really discouraging last time i was at

00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:34,350
notre dam i wasn't really thinking about

00:20:31,289 --> 00:20:36,809
that instance but i did end up standing

00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:38,789
in line beside a man and his wife and

00:20:36,809 --> 00:20:40,169
who were new to paris and i got to sort

00:20:38,789 --> 00:20:42,149
of be the tour guide and sort of just

00:20:40,169 --> 00:20:43,619
explained to them notre dame the towers

00:20:42,149 --> 00:20:45,320
that gargoyle is whatever else you know

00:20:43,619 --> 00:20:48,389
this the whole experience that i love

00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:51,360
and had a great time getting to know him

00:20:48,389 --> 00:20:52,649
and his wife and then we separated and i

00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:56,159
was getting annoyed with my roommates

00:20:52,649 --> 00:20:58,169
we'd been there for a week and i was i

00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:00,299
was really just anxious to be alone so i

00:20:58,169 --> 00:21:03,330
left them to go get pizza like dominoes

00:21:00,299 --> 00:21:04,919
in paris right but then i went to

00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:06,360
Harry's New York more in Paris which is

00:21:04,919 --> 00:21:08,549
another one my favorite places in Paris

00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:10,590
and instead of a you know an American

00:21:08,549 --> 00:21:13,440
pizza I had American Nathan's Famous

00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:18,059
hotdog in Paris and I SAT back in the

00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:20,309
corner by my a couple I don't they

00:21:18,059 --> 00:21:21,690
weren't I'm not sure what's sort of a

00:21:20,309 --> 00:21:23,280
couple but I was kind of like

00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:24,990
eavesdropping on their conversation

00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:27,930
you do in a Paris cafe here like okay

00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:30,330
who's talking about love or psychology

00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:34,010
or romance or history or whatever it is

00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:38,460
and the the woman leaned over to the man

00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:39,960
who I he was maybe 40s good looks from

00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:43,170
California and she said to him I think

00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:45,330
she was fried she may have been French

00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:46,140
but she said my tarot reader told me as

00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:48,900
I know this is going to be an

00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:50,010
interesting conversation my tarot reader

00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:51,480
told me that whenever you're telling

00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:54,390
someone's fortune you always have to

00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:56,160
sort of tell them a story not just the

00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:57,780
news you're not just delivering news or

00:21:56,160 --> 00:22:00,150
fortune you're making them believe in

00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:01,530
some sort of future version of

00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:03,090
themselves or you know whatever it is

00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:07,380
that tarot readers you're having been to

00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:10,830
one and then from there you know began

00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:13,560
to realize that you know the man had it

00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:15,450
I'd like it okay i guess like okay i was

00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:17,610
being very observant I wanted to tell

00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:20,190
this story later you know like a white

00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:22,020
ring around his finger right that you

00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:23,760
could just sort of see and so the

00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:26,970
question in my mind as well as this man

00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:30,300
like married and unlike me to see wish

00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:32,070
that sometimes that he wasn't is he

00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:34,260
cheating on somebody as he recently

00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:36,810
divorced and this is his chance to sort

00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:38,780
of escape and you know find a new life

00:22:36,810 --> 00:22:41,640
with a fringe mistress i'm not sure but

00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:43,230
you know waited around a my hot dog had

00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:45,590
a couple of very expensive cocktails

00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:48,600
because it is an American tourist trap

00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:50,690
and just sort of yeah thought about

00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:52,590
people who'd sat in this chair before

00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:54,870
Ernest Hemingway used to hang out there

00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:57,540
and sit next to James Joyce and probably

00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:59,010
talk about Ulysses you know as you're

00:22:57,540 --> 00:23:02,880
one around Dublin and see the placards

00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:04,500
on the ground and he in walked the dude

00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,510
that I was hanging out with it no jus da

00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:08,250
you apparently was meeting a couple of

00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:10,080
his buddies and then they were waiting

00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:11,970
on the daughters or some greek

00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,440
australian diplomats to show up who then

00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:14,850
took us to some four-star hotel bar

00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:17,100
because somehow their story became my

00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:18,720
story and before i knew it like here I

00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:20,280
was on my last night in paris staying

00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:22,020
out all night long bouncing from place

00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:23,490
to place and following my little you

00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:25,700
know train of revelers which was really

00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:28,110
an interesting and fun experience and

00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:32,430
I'm a I'm a father of three have been

00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:34,800
married for nine years now and I got I

00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:36,870
would definitely like do it over again

00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:39,090
where I was a single 33 year old

00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:41,700
and wish that maybe I didn't have kids

00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:44,430
that I had to provide for go home too

00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:48,210
and take care of and maybe wish that I

00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:50,850
wasn't married young and these are these

00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:53,870
are all like really hard things to think

00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:56,520
in the field because to me like success

00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:58,890
results in leadership and leadership is

00:23:56,520 --> 00:24:00,900
tied to character for me in a way that

00:23:58,890 --> 00:24:02,400
maybe maybe it's not the same for non

00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:05,490
religious or are religious people but to

00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:08,880
me like nothing can invalidate a leader

00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:12,360
more than some sort of egregious moral

00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:16,620
compromise and like I know that that

00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:19,679
seed of well I could just disappear in

00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:22,830
Paris or London Prague or Amsterdam or

00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:24,980
Bogota Shanghai any of the cities that I

00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:29,160
visited and I could just be gone and

00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:31,340
like I really I really sometimes want

00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:31,340
that

00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:51,990
hi everybody oh I'm Webtech um I'm a

00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:53,940
nerd I don't know if you can tell that

00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:57,030
by my physical appearance or my

00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:58,650
everything about me but yeah I've been

00:24:57,030 --> 00:25:00,240
into computers for a long time our first

00:24:58,650 --> 00:25:03,660
computer was a Victorian I was about

00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:05,040
three years old and nobody else in my

00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:06,120
family knew anything about computers so

00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:08,310
I was the one who had to kind of figure

00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:10,200
it out and you know how it worked how to

00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:12,600
hook it up to the TV how to program in

00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:14,460
basic you know copying little programs

00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:17,580
out of 321 contact magazine and stuff

00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:20,310
like that um and then we got the

00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:22,920
internet when I was like 16 and I was

00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:25,020
like holy crap this is amazing this is

00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:26,490
so like this is going to save the world

00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:28,590
because I can talk to someone in

00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:31,320
Pakistan and we can understand each

00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:32,940
other and and then you know fast forward

00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:34,380
like 20 years later and Donald Trump is

00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:37,470
running for president so that didn't

00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:39,240
quite Hannah but um you know that's it

00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:41,460
is what it is but I got super super

00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:42,570
super into everything that made the

00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:44,010
internet work because this want to learn

00:25:42,570 --> 00:25:45,540
everything about it and so I learned

00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:46,950
about linux I learned about open source

00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:49,710
software i learned about all these

00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:51,360
really smart guys that were like doing

00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:53,760
all this cool stuff and i was like wow

00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:55,470
this is amazing these are all these

00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:57,930
smart people putting together what they

00:25:55,470 --> 00:26:00,450
know in order to make something that

00:25:57,930 --> 00:26:02,580
everyone can use nonprofits educational

00:26:00,450 --> 00:26:04,290
institutions like you know not

00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:06,530
everything like anything that you want

00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:09,510
you can use this software it's free but

00:26:06,530 --> 00:26:11,460
you know they're all really smarts like

00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:12,900
they're like university-educated like

00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:15,030
blah blah blah blah blah they've been

00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:17,280
doing this for a million years and you

00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:19,350
know I'm just like you know in Community

00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:21,810
College and so like I'm it could never

00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:23,160
be like that but I totally want to chew

00:26:21,810 --> 00:26:25,260
them on from the sidelines or whatever

00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:27,330
and so that's what I did i first

00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:29,070
installed linux when it debian fit on

00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:31,350
seven floppy disks so this was a long

00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:34,320
time ago it's like 96 or something like

00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:36,960
that hmm and it wasn't until two

00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:39,840
thousand five which was like ten years

00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:41,670
later that Google ran this program

00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:44,490
called google Summer of Code and they

00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:46,830
deal was if you were as students then

00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:49,890
you picked an open source project yet

00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:51,120
you apply for and if they picked you for

00:26:49,890 --> 00:26:53,070
your project then you would get paid

00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:55,140
over the summer to work on open source

00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:57,420
and I was like wow well that sounds

00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:59,190
amazing you know and it kind of cracked

00:26:57,420 --> 00:27:00,930
a little tiny fissure and that you

00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:03,300
must be this smart to participate thing

00:27:00,930 --> 00:27:05,760
in my mind because you know obviously

00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:07,320
they're looking for students and you

00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:08,730
know that I'm a student so they know we

00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:10,980
don't know everything yet so maybe I'll

00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:12,270
try this you know and I applied for

00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:14,160
Drupal because I'm one of those people

00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:16,080
that goes around viewing source on every

00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:18,030
web page that I visit and they were

00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:19,080
actually powering the spread Firefox

00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:21,630
website at the time which was this

00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:23,610
really cool like grassroots marketing

00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:25,230
thing where anyone could upload a poster

00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:27,030
or like an event that was happening at

00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:28,680
their college or that kind of thing and

00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:31,260
I was like triple huh that sounds cool

00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:34,190
but I wrap my own CMS is why would I

00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:38,490
have to use that uh terrible anyway um

00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:40,650
so I applied and they accepted me turns

00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:42,690
out I was almost not accepted and at the

00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:44,880
eleventh hour robert douglas put my name

00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:47,370
so i was in the accepted list so thanks

00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:49,260
Robert that was great and then I got

00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:50,610
into this side of the contributing fence

00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:51,870
where it's like I actually had to write

00:27:50,610 --> 00:27:53,910
a module over the summer and figure out

00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:57,360
what the hell Drupal wasn't stuff and I

00:27:53,910 --> 00:27:58,950
realized oh my god like anyone can do

00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:01,860
this like and these people are like

00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:03,900
really nice like they'll help if you

00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:05,610
show a willingness to do stuff they're

00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:06,810
going to totally help you and get you

00:28:05,610 --> 00:28:09,630
wherever you need to go so I just need

00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:11,670
to go bananas and make up for ten years

00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:14,210
of lost time so I was like doing core

00:28:11,670 --> 00:28:16,920
development patch reviews documentation

00:28:14,210 --> 00:28:18,690
contributed modules I even did a theme

00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:20,580
once that was awful but you know

00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:22,260
whatever I'll try anything once I got on

00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:23,850
the security team and the webmasters

00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:25,020
team it just went like helping out with

00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:26,250
everything in they possibly could

00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:29,600
because I was so passionate about this

00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:32,340
community and the people in it and then

00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:35,940
John Van Dyke who's one of the creators

00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:39,660
of cck offered to fly me to amsterdam

00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:42,990
for drupalcon 2005 at the time and I was

00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:45,170
like what that doesn't make any sense

00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:47,460
why would someone in Iowa want to fly me

00:28:45,170 --> 00:28:49,080
from Vancouver all the way over to

00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:50,940
answer day I think was in Montreal the

00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:52,500
time anyway that did not compute and I

00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:54,330
was just like that makes no sense but

00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:58,500
have fun at your conference guys that's

00:28:54,330 --> 00:29:00,540
cool and then in vancouver in 2006 he

00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:02,880
offered to do it again and I'm like all

00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:04,260
right well be rude to say no so I'm

00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:06,210
going to take him up on his offer and so

00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:07,350
I flew out to Vancouver and I got to

00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:09,570
meet all these people I'd only known

00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:11,460
online in little blue nicknames and

00:29:09,570 --> 00:29:13,110
stuff in real life and I like had this

00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:14,580
big plan it was like going to like

00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:16,530
put on my google Summer of Code shirt

00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:17,760
and sit in the corner and really hope

00:29:16,530 --> 00:29:19,590
that someone would talk to me because I

00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:21,000
was so shy I didn't know who to talk to

00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:22,500
and this kind of thing and fortunately

00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,610
they figured out who I was pretty fast

00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:25,320
and they were super nice and all that

00:29:23,610 --> 00:29:27,059
kind of stuff so we were talking at

00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:29,100
lunch about what sessions we wanted to

00:29:27,059 --> 00:29:30,780
take in you know and I was like well

00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:32,130
there's this like beginner module

00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:34,530
development tutorial was thinking of

00:29:32,130 --> 00:29:36,960
going to and one of the other attendees

00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:39,090
Ali Mecca her name was who's like this

00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:41,340
badass chick in the in the Drupal

00:29:39,090 --> 00:29:44,040
community who I really look up to she

00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:45,809
was like what why are you going to a

00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:47,940
beginner module development session you

00:29:45,809 --> 00:29:52,200
like right core patches you don't need

00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:54,390
to do that and it was like oh yeah I

00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:55,679
guess I don't need to do that and it was

00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:58,080
interesting because it's kind of like

00:29:55,679 --> 00:30:00,120
what Megan said having somebody in your

00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:01,590
corner who like brings you out of that

00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:03,929
thought process that you're just not

00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:05,790
good enough for things is really really

00:30:03,929 --> 00:30:08,580
important and so what I try to do these

00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:11,370
days is be that person for other people

00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:13,020
because i feel like i still have

00:30:11,370 --> 00:30:14,669
impossible i still like want to throw up

00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:18,780
every time I have to give a talk like

00:30:14,669 --> 00:30:20,610
this it doesn't go away but I feel like

00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:22,500
you know I'm in a position where I can

00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:24,630
help other people like encourage you if

00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:26,220
you're thinking about ever being on a

00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:28,530
stage like this but this is too scary

00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:30,720
you know go you know give a talk at your

00:30:28,530 --> 00:30:32,520
local user group smaller you know more

00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,929
intimate kind of thing you know if

00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:35,340
you're terrified to get started

00:30:33,929 --> 00:30:36,690
contributing to patches come to the

00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:39,210
mentored sprint there's tons of people

00:30:36,690 --> 00:30:40,770
there who want to help you because it's

00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:42,450
so so difficult when you're on the

00:30:40,770 --> 00:30:44,429
outside of that you must be this smart

00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:46,230
wall to see that there's anything past

00:30:44,429 --> 00:30:48,600
that wall but if you possibly make your

00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:50,160
way in there you'll find the most warm

00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:52,049
welcoming community you could ever be

00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:55,400
part of and I would love you to join us

00:30:52,049 --> 00:30:55,400
so thank you

00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:05,510
thus ends the prepared material portion

00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:07,430
of our speech I'm like thanks everybody

00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:09,560
who came up on stage took a lot of guts

00:31:07,430 --> 00:31:10,910
and I had to beg and plead with more

00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:14,210
than a couple of people please please

00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:17,150
please come up this was sort of a little

00:31:14,210 --> 00:31:20,120
experiment I hope it went over well and

00:31:17,150 --> 00:31:23,150
we have twenty seven point three nine

00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:26,150
minutes for questions so if anybody has

00:31:23,150 --> 00:31:28,870
something to share or questions on the

00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:28,870
floor is yours

00:31:51,120 --> 00:32:00,800
hey David I have a job for you hello

00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:23,970
quite nervous standing up I just wanted

00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:26,970
to say thank you for sharing your

00:32:23,970 --> 00:32:28,590
experiences and insights I know that

00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:41,420
must have had quite uncomfortable for

00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:45,630
you but yeah thank you the mic is hot

00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:47,040
anyone else oh great there's hands this

00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:48,929
was going to get super awkward otherwise

00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:51,179
okay no no I think I think they're just

00:32:48,929 --> 00:32:58,080
pondering and taking notes about the

00:32:51,179 --> 00:33:01,710
questions they want to ask us um I just

00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:05,160
want to tell you that um ever since I

00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:08,700
came here three years ago but you know

00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:12,150
for the first doubling drupalcon I mean

00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:15,330
Drupal gun I was overwhelmed by the fact

00:33:12,150 --> 00:33:21,660
that there are so many people like like

00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:24,540
you who do all these incredible coding

00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:29,760
and and and all day it's incredible a

00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:34,140
work and still can share your fears and

00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:39,300
n and the way you overcame your failures

00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:44,280
and and and that you are not afraid of

00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:48,270
talking about it i still cannot i am

00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:54,270
amazed of this group and I really in

00:33:48,270 --> 00:33:57,330
this year I have realized that I really

00:33:54,270 --> 00:34:01,760
belong here and I am very grateful to

00:33:57,330 --> 00:34:04,860
you especially the six of you that have

00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:08,340
done this today I am

00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:11,909
really grateful and thank you very much

00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:22,020
for pouring your heart out I think

00:34:11,909 --> 00:34:24,510
that's a great thing to do so maybe we

00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:30,060
can take a moment to think about that a

00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:32,629
little bit so I know I have a physical

00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:35,250
reaction to speaking in public that

00:34:32,629 --> 00:34:38,879
involves some kind of adrenaline that

00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:44,550
flows through my body and I get really

00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:47,220
nervous but I but I still do it and for

00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:50,190
me one of the ways that I get through it

00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:52,980
is I think about the very very first

00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:55,530
thing that I have to do that I can do in

00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:58,830
any talk to start it and I always say hi

00:34:55,530 --> 00:35:00,180
I say it a lot every day all day long

00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:02,280
and so it's you know it's an easy

00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:04,680
pattern for me to repeat and so that

00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:06,570
kind of helps me with that a little bit

00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:10,109
I don't know if anybody else wants to

00:35:06,570 --> 00:35:13,320
say how they managed to do it despite

00:35:10,109 --> 00:35:15,180
their fear I tell a terrible dad joke at

00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:22,770
the beginning of my talks it breaks the

00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:25,350
ice so I wanted to join in thank you

00:35:22,770 --> 00:35:29,070
guys I learned about impostor syndrome

00:35:25,350 --> 00:35:32,190
my first day of work at Google it's part

00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:33,960
of our training like we talked about it

00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:38,730
very early on and I think one of them

00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:42,119
the best tricks i have i have come to to

00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:44,820
kind of get over it is knowing that so

00:35:42,119 --> 00:35:46,080
many other people experience it so the

00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:47,220
fact that you guys get up here and say

00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:49,740
that in front of everybody and your

00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:52,580
leaders in this community it's huge so

00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:55,950
thank you very much but also know that

00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:58,080
everyone like almost everyone in this

00:35:55,950 --> 00:36:01,530
field unless you're complete arrogant

00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:03,900
jackass has this problem so I think it's

00:36:01,530 --> 00:36:05,250
really important to like I know it

00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:06,890
doesn't help make the fear better it

00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:09,570
doesn't make that a bit of anxiety

00:36:06,890 --> 00:36:11,580
ething easier to deal with but know that

00:36:09,570 --> 00:36:14,970
everyone else thinks they're they're an

00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:16,660
imposter too and it's okay who in the

00:36:14,970 --> 00:36:22,960
room believes they

00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:30,010
are imposters I'd agree with some of

00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:42,940
those yeah my dad jerk you're bad

00:36:30,010 --> 00:36:45,250
anybody else hi guys first of all thanks

00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:47,170
again for doing this I think this is a

00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:51,400
great opportunity for the whole

00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:53,500
community here one thing I had in mind

00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:54,940
was well first I think it's so great

00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:57,220
that you guys are kind of putting a

00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:59,079
human face to the companies involved

00:36:57,220 --> 00:37:00,579
here because you know when we come to

00:36:59,079 --> 00:37:03,369
Drupal con you go to the exhibit hall

00:37:00,579 --> 00:37:04,869
and you see all these you know fancy

00:37:03,369 --> 00:37:07,539
booths and all these big name companies

00:37:04,869 --> 00:37:10,089
and that you've seen online and so it

00:37:07,539 --> 00:37:11,589
can be very intimidating to to go to the

00:37:10,089 --> 00:37:13,299
exhibit hall for example and see all

00:37:11,589 --> 00:37:15,369
these companies and you don't know who

00:37:13,299 --> 00:37:16,740
to approach so first of all it's just

00:37:15,369 --> 00:37:21,010
great that you put a human face on it

00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:22,930
and I so you guys give a few tips on on

00:37:21,010 --> 00:37:23,950
how to deal with impostor syndrome but i

00:37:22,930 --> 00:37:26,289
was thinking i don't know if we can

00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:28,869
start some kind of community initiative

00:37:26,289 --> 00:37:30,190
at some point i was thinking some kind

00:37:28,869 --> 00:37:31,960
of like mentorship program almost

00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:33,460
because we could talk about I think

00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:35,260
that's that is recurrent theme and

00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:37,150
finding a mentor I know I may be a

00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:39,240
couple of you mentioned that and I've

00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:41,589
started trying to do that now you know

00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:43,510
so maybe that's something we can start

00:37:41,589 --> 00:37:44,799
as a Drupal community initiative somehow

00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:47,589
I don't know how that will work but

00:37:44,799 --> 00:37:49,660
maybe that could be a community sprint

00:37:47,589 --> 00:37:51,460
project or something like that but if

00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:52,770
you guys have any input on that if

00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:57,130
you've ever thought about that before

00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:59,260
I'd like to hear about that so I always

00:37:57,130 --> 00:38:04,180
like to volunteer the DA to do things

00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:06,940
and and the and the DA has this really

00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:10,750
awesome um newsletter that you can

00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:12,880
subscribe to be of checking a box in

00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:15,930
your drupal.org account oh by the way

00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:20,470
you should have a drupal.org account and

00:38:15,930 --> 00:38:25,890
I don't know we could have like impostor

00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:33,760
tip of the day in the newsletter maybe

00:38:25,890 --> 00:38:35,260
impostor of the day you're awful um well

00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:37,839
yeah sorry I thought you're making a

00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:40,420
joke she said she said what about a

00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:51,190
slack channel and I was like haha that's

00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:52,809
funny yeah so um so there's a so we

00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:54,430
actually do have a couple different ways

00:38:52,809 --> 00:38:56,140
of chatting in the Drupal community one

00:38:54,430 --> 00:38:59,799
of them is IRC and one of them is slack

00:38:56,140 --> 00:39:01,900
and if you go to drupal.org at the very

00:38:59,799 --> 00:39:04,690
top of the page one of the links says

00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:06,549
community and if you click on that you

00:39:04,690 --> 00:39:09,069
go to the community page and there's a

00:39:06,549 --> 00:39:10,750
paragraph there which says chat and then

00:39:09,069 --> 00:39:13,510
there's instructions on how to get on

00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:16,539
IRC and then there's also a link to get

00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:18,930
automatically approved to be through the

00:39:16,539 --> 00:39:21,869
invitation to the Drupal slack team and

00:39:18,930 --> 00:39:25,839
what she's saying is that one of the

00:39:21,869 --> 00:39:30,339
channels in the team is the is dribble

00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:34,210
dash inclusivity diversity dash

00:39:30,339 --> 00:39:40,599
inclusion and there's a real like live

00:39:34,210 --> 00:39:54,490
meetings when are they every thursday at

00:39:40,599 --> 00:39:56,859
nine a.m. pacific time 9a Oh Pacific it

00:39:54,490 --> 00:39:58,990
time zones they're tricky we can ask the

00:39:56,859 --> 00:40:01,329
internet and it'll tell us now the other

00:39:58,990 --> 00:40:03,700
thing that you mentioned was that you

00:40:01,329 --> 00:40:05,410
heard us give a few tips as we were

00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:08,410
telling our stories and kind of on

00:40:05,410 --> 00:40:11,859
purpose I think we didn't want to

00:40:08,410 --> 00:40:14,710
include too many tips so if somebody has

00:40:11,859 --> 00:40:16,329
like a question like hey you know what

00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:18,160
would you do in this situation do you

00:40:16,329 --> 00:40:20,230
have any tips I mean we certainly have

00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:22,059
them but we just we kind of wanted to

00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:24,609
save them for the question answer period

00:40:22,059 --> 00:40:27,880
so that that we can talk about those

00:40:24,609 --> 00:40:29,349
things awesome yeah you want to talk

00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:31,660
about the one that we talked about

00:40:29,349 --> 00:40:34,440
earlier today just spending behind them

00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:40,109
and getting stuff the first step

00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:42,390
I just caught you so so uh well like

00:40:40,109 --> 00:40:45,780
Emma mentioned right how cool it was to

00:40:42,390 --> 00:40:50,640
be up here talking with people who were

00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:53,040
her her mentors right and Gabor is also

00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:55,740
one of my mentors and so he's going to

00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:57,599
talk about mentoring yeah so one of the

00:40:55,740 --> 00:41:02,700
things we discussed today when we were

00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:05,099
preparing for this pedal is is how how a

00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:07,380
big part of the first time contributor

00:41:05,099 --> 00:41:10,260
I'm entering is about getting people

00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:13,140
over the first step is to get them over

00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:14,490
their fears because people can do those

00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:17,310
changes that they want to make people

00:41:14,490 --> 00:41:20,849
can can review those patches people can

00:41:17,310 --> 00:41:23,190
can produce those screenshots but but

00:41:20,849 --> 00:41:26,010
what we see is that a lot of people are

00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:27,599
afraid to post them in public because of

00:41:26,010 --> 00:41:29,040
the fear of failure and that people

00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:31,050
would figure out that I'm not good

00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:33,420
enough for this like I've seen people

00:41:31,050 --> 00:41:35,819
who would be excelling contributors to

00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:38,099
the UX initiative but they are like some

00:41:35,819 --> 00:41:39,960
big name at some company and they don't

00:41:38,099 --> 00:41:42,359
want to publish anything until it's

00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:44,579
perfect and then we don't see those

00:41:42,359 --> 00:41:47,609
results so one of the one of the goals

00:41:44,579 --> 00:41:49,500
of the of the mentoring team and the

00:41:47,609 --> 00:41:51,869
first time contributor workshop is just

00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:53,849
to get people over that fear and not

00:41:51,869 --> 00:41:55,589
necessarily it's not it's not Drupal

00:41:53,849 --> 00:41:57,720
mentoring is just get them get them

00:41:55,589 --> 00:41:59,940
understand that it's still totally okay

00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:02,220
to post it and it may not be good but we

00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:04,980
are doing those things as well i mean i

00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:07,740
posted parse errors to Drupal core

00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:10,589
before so I I committed them to core so

00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:21,450
like if that's fine then whatever could

00:42:10,589 --> 00:42:23,460
be okay so one of the so Friday sprint

00:42:21,450 --> 00:42:26,970
day there'll be tons of mentors there

00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:29,849
and the experienced mentors will meet

00:42:26,970 --> 00:42:32,700
with the new mentors ahead of time to

00:42:29,849 --> 00:42:35,130
help them prepare and one of the things

00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:37,200
that we talked about is we want all of

00:42:35,130 --> 00:42:38,880
the mentors to help the people who are

00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:40,740
attending the sprint to have reasonable

00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:44,069
expectations of what they can accomplish

00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:47,460
that day and what I tell the mentors is

00:42:44,069 --> 00:42:48,270
that if we can get the attendees to

00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:54,090
click Save

00:42:48,270 --> 00:42:56,760
on a comment on an issue and in the

00:42:54,090 --> 00:42:59,310
process of doing that all day long they

00:42:56,760 --> 00:43:01,890
have had a good enough time that they

00:42:59,310 --> 00:43:05,340
might be willing to do it again then we

00:43:01,890 --> 00:43:07,590
win all the things and then one of the

00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:10,740
things that we do with the attendees is

00:43:07,590 --> 00:43:14,220
we tell them that as mentors like that's

00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:16,110
our measure of success for you and and

00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:18,840
we help them know that when they have

00:43:16,110 --> 00:43:21,000
done that when they've had a good enough

00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:22,890
time that they're willing to do it again

00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:26,310
and they posted a comment on an issue

00:43:22,890 --> 00:43:28,920
like they have met what they may look up

00:43:26,310 --> 00:43:33,780
to as leaders in the community they have

00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:37,020
met our expectations for them and and I

00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:41,520
think it's that you know click Save it's

00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:48,780
gonna be okay is the job of the of the

00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:51,810
mentor sometimes can I ask a provocative

00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:53,400
question possibly um I know this is

00:43:51,810 --> 00:43:55,740
totally cheating here by because I have

00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:57,330
the mic do you feel for everybody who's

00:43:55,740 --> 00:43:59,010
on the stage and this may be more

00:43:57,330 --> 00:44:01,440
applicable to the gobblers in though and

00:43:59,010 --> 00:44:05,010
the Ryan's of the world here that the

00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:08,550
bar to participate and or meaningfully

00:44:05,010 --> 00:44:11,040
contribute or succeed in Drupal

00:44:08,550 --> 00:44:13,350
professionally is higher now than when

00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:21,390
you guys had your entrée into the Drupal

00:44:13,350 --> 00:44:25,410
world yeah I think it is a lot harder I

00:44:21,390 --> 00:44:28,260
came in about 11 years ago and there

00:44:25,410 --> 00:44:29,730
were not many modules like all the

00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:33,330
documentation was written for people who

00:44:29,730 --> 00:44:36,690
knew what CBS was you know there was

00:44:33,330 --> 00:44:39,060
core was like one one-thousandth of the

00:44:36,690 --> 00:44:40,980
size that it is today you know nowadays

00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:42,080
when you are coming into the community

00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:44,580
and trying to make a name for yourself

00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:46,440
like my module that I wrote for summer

00:44:44,580 --> 00:44:48,600
code was called quiz and it's still

00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:50,010
around thankfully I have nothing to do

00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:55,200
with it anymore so I'm sure it's better

00:44:50,010 --> 00:44:56,850
now but but the at this point you know

00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:58,320
you're not going to write another views

00:44:56,850 --> 00:44:59,220
model you're not gonna write another cck

00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:00,930
maza you're not going to write another

00:44:59,220 --> 00:45:01,619
quiz module all that stuff is already

00:45:00,930 --> 00:45:04,529
written it what you're

00:45:01,619 --> 00:45:06,230
is more thankless it's like porting

00:45:04,529 --> 00:45:08,730
things from some of the eight or it's

00:45:06,230 --> 00:45:10,170
getting the thing into core which is

00:45:08,730 --> 00:45:12,960
great but you know what I mean it's not

00:45:10,170 --> 00:45:15,990
innovating new work and while you can

00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:17,279
gain a lot of like admirable respect

00:45:15,990 --> 00:45:19,950
from people for doing that kind of work

00:45:17,279 --> 00:45:22,529
like especially the insider crowd like I

00:45:19,950 --> 00:45:23,999
love when people work on core and make

00:45:22,529 --> 00:45:26,759
poor better for everyone because that

00:45:23,999 --> 00:45:28,890
just you know fixing a bug in core fixes

00:45:26,759 --> 00:45:30,960
it for like 1.5 million people which is

00:45:28,890 --> 00:45:34,230
just like great return on investment but

00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:36,089
anyway um but I think it is a lot harder

00:45:34,230 --> 00:45:38,880
core is bigger now there's a lot more

00:45:36,089 --> 00:45:41,880
people involved it's harder to you know

00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:43,619
just find trees randomly sauntering

00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:45,569
around the sidewalk at a triple con

00:45:43,619 --> 00:45:47,279
these days like I do think it's harder I

00:45:45,569 --> 00:45:49,349
think though that we have a lot better

00:45:47,279 --> 00:45:52,650
infrastructure now than we did back then

00:45:49,349 --> 00:45:54,660
because back then like the handbook was

00:45:52,650 --> 00:45:56,700
like 200 pages you could read it in one

00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:58,609
sitting we have a lot more documentation

00:45:56,700 --> 00:46:00,990
now to help people get started we have

00:45:58,609 --> 00:46:02,880
companies around Drupal training now to

00:46:00,990 --> 00:46:05,160
help people get started so to reduce the

00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:06,809
learning curve there we have things like

00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:09,359
a structured mentoring program to help

00:46:06,809 --> 00:46:11,640
new people get matched up with things to

00:46:09,359 --> 00:46:13,680
work on and that was never a thing right

00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:15,869
like it was like we gotta take our table

00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:17,400
a conference table in the hotel we all

00:46:15,869 --> 00:46:18,480
SAT around and we all just like made

00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:19,710
stuff up we didn't know what you're

00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:22,319
doing you know it's a lot more

00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:24,390
streamlined and and you know there's a

00:46:22,319 --> 00:46:27,480
lot more thoughtfulness behind it I

00:46:24,390 --> 00:46:30,180
guess for for good and for you know not

00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:31,890
so good so um but I do think it's harder

00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:34,470
i think the project application process

00:46:31,890 --> 00:46:36,210
has definitely made things harder my

00:46:34,470 --> 00:46:38,039
project application was process was like

00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:40,529
i'm in google Summer of Code I need CBS

00:46:38,039 --> 00:46:44,339
access done you know so that is

00:46:40,529 --> 00:46:45,779
unfortunate so we're working on fixing a

00:46:44,339 --> 00:46:47,489
lot of these kinds of things but yeah I

00:46:45,779 --> 00:46:49,380
think anyone who says it's not as easy

00:46:47,489 --> 00:46:53,220
to get in now as it used to be is

00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:56,099
exactly right but I think that because

00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:57,480
the community is larger and because it's

00:46:56,099 --> 00:46:59,009
a bit more structured than it was back

00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:00,720
in the day I think the entry point into

00:46:59,009 --> 00:47:02,539
the community there's a lot more of them

00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:06,269
and a lot friendlier than it used to be

00:47:02,539 --> 00:47:08,420
so it's a little bit of a you know toss

00:47:06,269 --> 00:47:08,420
it

00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:14,440
and a first ban on the works here so um

00:47:12,220 --> 00:47:17,260
like I said I was doing lots of

00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:19,680
technical things and trying to be super

00:47:17,260 --> 00:47:24,070
fantastic and then I realized that

00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:25,780
contributing not with code um I really

00:47:24,070 --> 00:47:30,660
wanted to get into that but I felt very

00:47:25,780 --> 00:47:33,250
like I was not doing about it a word

00:47:30,660 --> 00:47:37,020
equally valuable thing to contributing

00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:40,840
code and I figured out that like we can

00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:43,330
value the value we can we like basically

00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:46,510
we need to like increase the visibility

00:47:43,330 --> 00:47:50,260
of non-code contributions as well and

00:47:46,510 --> 00:47:51,690
have mentors all over the commuter

00:47:50,260 --> 00:47:54,940
Community Mental is not just

00:47:51,690 --> 00:47:58,630
contribution mentors and to support that

00:47:54,940 --> 00:48:03,610
and to help others and I have many ideas

00:47:58,630 --> 00:48:06,310
because I and now I couple of words yes

00:48:03,610 --> 00:48:08,560
so more than just code and the code base

00:48:06,310 --> 00:48:11,950
and everything like that because I just

00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:13,780
felt super uncomfortable and not feeling

00:48:11,950 --> 00:48:15,850
like I was doing enough when that she I

00:48:13,780 --> 00:48:17,730
was and I really like the things I do

00:48:15,850 --> 00:48:20,350
now to improve the community as a whole

00:48:17,730 --> 00:48:26,260
so I think I probably mess that up a

00:48:20,350 --> 00:48:29,130
headful so yeah so piggybacking on that

00:48:26,260 --> 00:48:32,410
I think that Drupal community is now

00:48:29,130 --> 00:48:34,390
maybe huge and scary so well it looks

00:48:32,410 --> 00:48:36,460
great that it's if you look at the group

00:48:34,390 --> 00:48:41,110
photo from this morning it's huge and

00:48:36,460 --> 00:48:42,700
scary but but I think if you can find

00:48:41,110 --> 00:48:45,160
that if you can find the human

00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:47,380
connections that will work for you

00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:48,970
whatever change you want to make in

00:48:47,380 --> 00:48:52,120
Drupal you will need at least one more

00:48:48,970 --> 00:48:55,720
human involved so if you can find the

00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:58,510
human connection somehow in in different

00:48:55,720 --> 00:49:00,910
communities then you can get involved

00:48:58,510 --> 00:49:03,100
you can get help and basically a thing

00:49:00,910 --> 00:49:04,630
the trick that you can do is instead of

00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:07,590
looking at your bless this big huge

00:49:04,630 --> 00:49:10,030
thing the fine you are small safe space

00:49:07,590 --> 00:49:13,180
like the Germans are organizing

00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:14,920
translation sprints that they like say

00:49:13,180 --> 00:49:16,810
what time and then people can go there

00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:18,960
and they're like 10 people and they can

00:49:16,810 --> 00:49:21,190
work together and even those who never

00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:21,470
suggested translations can work with

00:49:21,190 --> 00:49:23,660
them

00:49:21,470 --> 00:49:26,720
there's initiatives who have meeting

00:49:23,660 --> 00:49:29,240
times together and they want to get help

00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:31,490
or with fixing bugs and reviewing new

00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:33,260
patches and they will help you if you're

00:49:31,490 --> 00:49:35,450
interested in the same area and you have

00:49:33,260 --> 00:49:38,330
problems in there so I think the key is

00:49:35,450 --> 00:49:40,280
to figure out what you want to work on

00:49:38,330 --> 00:49:43,099
if you want to get involved somehow and

00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:46,340
then find the safe space the group that

00:49:43,099 --> 00:49:47,570
is related to that and then try to get

00:49:46,340 --> 00:49:50,330
involved with that group because you

00:49:47,570 --> 00:49:53,599
find the human connections you you get

00:49:50,330 --> 00:50:05,390
help and you work towards a shared goal

00:49:53,599 --> 00:50:10,580
so everybody benefits so I made you do

00:50:05,390 --> 00:50:11,660
something look I just did it so so we

00:50:10,580 --> 00:50:14,690
just want to point out that if you are

00:50:11,660 --> 00:50:16,670
looking to contribute to Drupal

00:50:14,690 --> 00:50:21,310
contribute to Drupal but not necessarily

00:50:16,670 --> 00:50:24,320
code that there is a session by rocky

00:50:21,310 --> 00:50:26,030
man Monday honey I did not say that

00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:27,859
right but rocky is her first name I said

00:50:26,030 --> 00:50:31,640
that correctly anyhow it's a really

00:50:27,859 --> 00:50:32,990
great session that talks about just how

00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:35,000
to kind of go through the process and

00:50:32,990 --> 00:50:37,430
the feelings you're going to have and

00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:39,380
talk about what's going to motivate you

00:50:37,430 --> 00:50:42,230
to move through and who can help you and

00:50:39,380 --> 00:50:44,990
so and actually she interviewed me after

00:50:42,230 --> 00:50:46,490
she saw my slides this morning so you're

00:50:44,990 --> 00:50:49,640
going to hear about my experience again

00:50:46,490 --> 00:50:51,680
there but you know just having gone

00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:53,089
through it myself and knowing how I was

00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:58,760
like anxious written during the whole

00:50:53,089 --> 00:51:03,290
process anyhow it's a good session so it

00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:10,010
might be a good follow-up for you ok

00:51:03,290 --> 00:51:16,849
it's Wednesday it is in lippy meeting

00:51:10,010 --> 00:51:18,710
three at 1045 I'm not sure whom to ask

00:51:16,849 --> 00:51:22,790
because I think it's a question to all

00:51:18,710 --> 00:51:28,520
of you I have kind of motivation

00:51:22,790 --> 00:51:31,099
question so we all know that you go to

00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:33,859
certain level of success in rupal

00:51:31,099 --> 00:51:36,840
community which causes

00:51:33,859 --> 00:51:39,930
unpleasant feelings of important or

00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:43,619
maybe something else but you still

00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:51,619
continue doing what you're doing so my

00:51:43,619 --> 00:51:55,050
question why exactly to the people and

00:51:51,619 --> 00:51:58,830
helping people and all the back good

00:51:55,050 --> 00:52:01,560
collar and stuff like this guy's like

00:51:58,830 --> 00:52:04,260
everything scares me basically but I'm

00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:06,780
like helping with you and anything else

00:52:04,260 --> 00:52:09,150
I do it's you're helping someone out and

00:52:06,780 --> 00:52:10,980
if you do get a little bit cell therapy

00:52:09,150 --> 00:52:15,900
as well I feel pretty good right now

00:52:10,980 --> 00:52:17,670
yeah that's my office for me at the end

00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:22,109
of the day I do love my wife and my

00:52:17,670 --> 00:52:24,150
children and so I work you know I'm also

00:52:22,109 --> 00:52:25,859
still curious as curious as i was

00:52:24,150 --> 00:52:27,300
whenever I you know started with Drupal

00:52:25,859 --> 00:52:29,940
and actually did everything wrong

00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:32,820
whenever I started with Drupal I rewrote

00:52:29,940 --> 00:52:36,359
an existing popular module and then I

00:52:32,820 --> 00:52:38,550
did it again and and then I got shouted

00:52:36,359 --> 00:52:40,800
out of IRC I know Angie has a similar

00:52:38,550 --> 00:52:42,450
thought you know I say yeah but I was

00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:47,369
curious enough and interested enough

00:52:42,450 --> 00:52:50,970
that I just you know kept going so there

00:52:47,369 --> 00:52:57,720
was yeah desire interest need to fix

00:52:50,970 --> 00:53:00,480
things so it's definitely about the

00:52:57,720 --> 00:53:02,849
people for me you know taking care of

00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:05,940
the staff and in the community but I

00:53:02,849 --> 00:53:08,010
also have like a like a worldview why

00:53:05,940 --> 00:53:13,109
and I feel like the world's really

00:53:08,010 --> 00:53:16,140
complex and you know this community is

00:53:13,109 --> 00:53:20,940
really special with its culture and how

00:53:16,140 --> 00:53:22,770
inclusive it is and how open it is and I

00:53:20,940 --> 00:53:24,630
feel like we're just a shining spot in

00:53:22,770 --> 00:53:26,700
this world and it needs to be protected

00:53:24,630 --> 00:53:28,680
I think the world needs more of these

00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:30,570
kinds of communities in it and I feel

00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:33,990
like I get to play a role to protect

00:53:30,570 --> 00:53:35,820
that and I feel that we can also as a

00:53:33,990 --> 00:53:38,220
community through role models for other

00:53:35,820 --> 00:53:40,080
communities out there and kind of expand

00:53:38,220 --> 00:53:42,680
what we have I think it's very special

00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:42,680
and worth protecting

00:53:44,570 --> 00:53:50,840
I think that's a great way to wrap it on

00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:54,470
thanks again for other 610 I thought I

00:53:50,840 --> 00:54:01,190
thought I saw elina had a question you

00:53:54,470 --> 00:54:03,650
were thanks for putting me on the spot I

00:54:01,190 --> 00:54:05,510
was going to ask whether any of you had

00:54:03,650 --> 00:54:21,400
any questions for each other I was gonna

00:54:05,510 --> 00:54:31,580
turn like you unto you I have a question

00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:33,860
why are you all so awesome they're not

00:54:31,580 --> 00:54:39,950
awesome let that be on the record no I

00:54:33,860 --> 00:54:45,290
know I know the answer I think I think

00:54:39,950 --> 00:54:48,880
we're all so awesome because we have

00:54:45,290 --> 00:54:52,340
been able to work with other people and

00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:55,310
recognize that there's not that much

00:54:52,340 --> 00:54:57,230
different between us and and other

00:54:55,310 --> 00:55:01,240
people in terms of perhaps like our

00:54:57,230 --> 00:55:01,240
technical skill set or whatever and

00:55:01,420 --> 00:55:11,330
those people that we work with have

00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:14,540
helped us recognize the things that that

00:55:11,330 --> 00:55:16,550
are useful about us and and they talk to

00:55:14,540 --> 00:55:17,930
us about what we want to do and why we

00:55:16,550 --> 00:55:20,900
want to do it and then and then they

00:55:17,930 --> 00:55:24,200
help us do it so if we are awesome it's

00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:26,780
because we work with other people

00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:28,670
they're just regular people that that

00:55:26,780 --> 00:55:34,010
help us do the things that that we want

00:55:28,670 --> 00:55:37,400
to do friendly yeah actually yeah so I

00:55:34,010 --> 00:55:40,400
think I feel awesome when I make other

00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:43,610
people feel awesome so i'm tryna I'm

00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:45,830
trying to work as an enabler to to make

00:55:43,610 --> 00:55:47,540
others other people's dreams happen and

00:55:45,830 --> 00:55:50,110
if that if that is successful then I

00:55:47,540 --> 00:55:50,110
feel awesome

00:55:52,270 --> 00:55:56,540
