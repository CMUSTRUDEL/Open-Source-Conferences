you may be familiar with me so far

00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:16,859
because i'd probably bugged you at least

00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:20,189
once or twice asking for you to submit

00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:22,109

sponsorship if you attended the previous

00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:33,780
webinar watched it online that was more

00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:36,380
about running through the mean potatoes

00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:39,149
of your sponsorship what it comes with

00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:40,530
how to fulfill all them this one's

00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:43,739
really going to be more about your

00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:45,480
experience there a drupalcon dublin as a

00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:48,450
sponsor and really how to take advantage

00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:52,920
of everything else that comes along with

00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:56,399
being a sponsor at this drupal centered

00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:59,640
event so as always I'm start with a few

00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:01,559
housekeeping items first off welcome if

00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:05,610

00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:07,500
this recording welcome as well and I

00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:09,270
just want to start out by thanking you

00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:12,210
guys because if you're watching this you

00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:15,420
who are a sponsor or a part of a

00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:19,140
sponsoring company and I can't say it

00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:21,000
enough without you guys this truly would

00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:23,610
not be possible we would not be able to

00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,130
put on these events around the globe we

00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:28,140
would not be able to help bring these

00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:32,430
people in the Drupal community together

00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:34,650
to celebrate Drupal and without your

00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:37,409
support your financial support none of

00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:39,869
this would be possible so from me from

00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:42,680
the entire stupa l'association by the

00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:45,420
Drupal community just want to thank you

00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:47,399

00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:51,540
have any questions you can drop them in

00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:56,430
the Q&A window you will be muted for the

00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:58,680
entirety of the of the webinar but if

00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:00,360
you have any questions do that and if

00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:02,430
you have any follow-up questions you

00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:05,280
have my email again it's tim c at

00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:08,879
association doubt drupal.org or you can

00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:11,459
skype me either way it doesn't matter so

00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:13,230
first you just want to start out by

00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:13,590
talking about what we are going to be

00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:15,629
talking

00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:19,019
during this webinar and that's basically

00:02:15,629 --> 00:02:21,540
just four steps of six success so

00:02:19,019 --> 00:02:26,000
basically four steps that you should be

00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:28,950
aware of on how to have a successful or

00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:32,220
valuable time as a sponsor I drupalcon

00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:34,170
the first thing is basically just

00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:36,349
understanding the Drupal community and

00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:39,150
understand what happens at drupalcon

00:02:36,349 --> 00:02:42,239
your sponsor and you've been doing this

00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:44,670
for a long time or if you're a agency

00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:46,410
that specifically focuses in Drupal you

00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:49,640
probably have a great understanding but

00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:53,329
many of you are new or just starting to

00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:58,860
grasp the idea of the Drupal community

00:02:53,329 --> 00:03:02,430
so do your research learn about it ask

00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:05,069
around see what you can do to put

00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:07,920
yourself out of Vantage the next step is

00:03:05,069 --> 00:03:09,720
to define your goals in your message so

00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:12,209
what do you want to come out or just

00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:15,510
knowing what you want to get out of this

00:03:12,209 --> 00:03:21,049
and knowing how you're going to achieve

00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:23,609
that goal before you arrive is going to

00:03:21,049 --> 00:03:27,450
save you not only a lot of time and

00:03:23,609 --> 00:03:31,410
hassle but most likely make your

00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:33,889
experience a more valuable and you know

00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:36,810
you see that good returner looking for

00:03:33,889 --> 00:03:38,340
next step is to be proactive so again

00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:41,430
this kind of goes into step to be

00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:43,500
proactive and prepare but be proactive

00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:45,840
while you're at rubicon and people or

00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:50,010
active after drupalcon by following up

00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:52,169
as need beam and a last step is really

00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:53,400
the one that I want to highlight here

00:03:52,169 --> 00:03:57,690
and that's just to take full advantage

00:03:53,400 --> 00:04:00,359
of drupalcon you know the first three

00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:02,400
steps you can take to any event the last

00:04:00,359 --> 00:04:07,019
step taking full advantage of true pecan

00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:11,000
is really the unique platforms mediums

00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:14,299
that we have agile pecan for you to

00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,769
maximize and take advantage of because

00:04:14,299 --> 00:04:19,410
there are a lot of things going on other

00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:21,810
than the show for so we like to kind of

00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:24,240
envisioned rubicon as a platform just

00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:27,460
like drupal itself is a platform for

00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:30,220
creating websites rubicon is a plat

00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:34,479
one for you as a sponsor to achieve your

00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:36,669
goals and you know have a good time so

00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:38,410
going into step one which is just

00:04:36,669 --> 00:04:40,389
understanding drupalcon and

00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:44,410
understanding the Drupal community I

00:04:40,389 --> 00:04:45,849
pull this quote from the website the

00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:48,759
Drupal community is one of the largest

00:04:45,849 --> 00:04:51,310
open source communities in the world we

00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:53,770
are developers designers strategist

00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:56,410
coordinators editors translators and

00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:59,110
more you know the list will probably go

00:04:56,410 --> 00:05:02,710
on because that's really what it is the

00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:07,000
Drupal community is vast it's colorful

00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:11,710
it's unique and you know that's what we

00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:13,509
take pride in and as part of the crew

00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:16,270
that organized is rupak on this is stuff

00:05:13,509 --> 00:05:19,180
we drive for we you know strive for

00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:22,150
diversity but one thing will continue to

00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:26,110
remain constant and that is Drupal is

00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:28,449
king drupalcon is literally put on to

00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:31,990
celebrate Drupal or to bring together

00:05:28,449 --> 00:05:34,509
the people that build Drupal from across

00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:37,659
the globe together face to face so they

00:05:34,509 --> 00:05:40,030
can you know meet each other and add

00:05:37,659 --> 00:05:42,630
some sort of personal touch to it or

00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:47,590
just collaborate a little bit deeper

00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:51,400
into what they are working on so that

00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:53,880
being said stick with Drupal there are a

00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:56,139
lot of other platforms and tools and

00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:58,000
case studies out there but whatever it

00:05:56,139 --> 00:06:00,479
is that you're doing stick with Drupal

00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,430
so if you're a sponsor and you're are a

00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:06,009
company that offers a piece of software

00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:07,960
that integrates with Drupal talk about

00:06:06,009 --> 00:06:11,759
how you integrate with you poor or how

00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:15,520
your integration your software can help

00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:19,300
maximize Drupal if you're a hosting

00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:22,120
company talk about how your hosting

00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:24,310
platform for Drupal will make the

00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:27,520
development process so much easier so

00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:32,199
much smoother or if you are an agency

00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:36,639
that builds websites for companies and

00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:38,889
you use a variety of tools you know talk

00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:41,260
about case studies involving Drupal it

00:06:38,889 --> 00:06:43,330
seems pretty obvious but

00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:46,870
you know is kind of important because

00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:48,880
these people are here to litter to talk

00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:52,330
about Drupal to learn about it so stick

00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:54,640
with it the next point here is kind of

00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:57,580
just the community mantra so it's come

00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:59,560
for the code stay for the community this

00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:02,110
is something always keep in mind as a

00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:04,900
sponsor because yes the code is great

00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:07,480
the platform is great and its continuing

00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:10,290
to get better and better but what keeps

00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:13,960
people around and what keeps people

00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:17,020
dedicating loads amount of time and

00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:18,910
resources is the community because as I

00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:26,800
touched on before it's unique to

00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:29,380
welcoming is diverse and so try you know

00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:32,350
try to become it don't try to stand out

00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:34,300
you know by you know interfering with

00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:37,510
their experience here or look for ways

00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:41,140
on how you can join the community or

00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:42,970
become a part of the community and you

00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:45,750
know that can really start with by

00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:47,800
asking yourself what can you do for them

00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:51,250
most of these people like i mentioned

00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:54,880
have contributed countless amount of

00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:56,890
hours or resources into drupal because

00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:58,990
they are that passionate about it or

00:07:56,890 --> 00:08:01,180
they believe it really truly is the best

00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:03,070
solution out there and so they are

00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:05,110
contributing what they have so now it's

00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:07,660
your turn to ask yourselves what you can

00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:10,960
do for them it's a good way to build

00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:13,060
credibility with them because just like

00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:17,200
they are contributing if you can

00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:19,690
contribute a bit of knowledge or a tool

00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:21,700
to make it easier for them or to make

00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:23,890
them a better drupal developer you know

00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:26,380
it's a good way to build credibility and

00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:30,250
to establish that recognition that

00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:32,169
you're looking for him you don't know or

00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:34,750
you're kind of instill confused about

00:08:32,169 --> 00:08:36,580
the Drupal community or you're confused

00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:38,460
about what's what's going to happen

00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:40,950
about at

00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:43,950
drupalcon you can find out you have

00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:46,800
drupal.org you have user groups you have

00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:49,170
your local community and as always you

00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,970
have us feel free to just email me if

00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:52,860
you're not sure or email your account

00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:54,630
manager or reach out to the drupal

00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:57,150
association in general will be happy to

00:08:54,630 --> 00:09:01,350
help help guide you along this process

00:08:57,150 --> 00:09:05,790
of understanding this this this this

00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:08,940
community next step I want to touch on

00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:16,880
is really to just define your goals and

00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:21,240
define your messaging before attending

00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:25,230
drupalcon because as basic as it sounds

00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:27,000
you know sometimes people wait until

00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:28,590
they're there to find out what their

00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,720
goals are and then you're going to lose

00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:35,090
that efficiency you're after in a waste

00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:38,700
time so we've sort of narrowed down what

00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:43,490
we've seen as the four main goals from

00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:45,480
our sponsors in the past to business

00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:47,940
acquisition and development networking

00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:50,340
and partnerships talent recruitment and

00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:52,500
team strengthening and community and

00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:55,320
thought leadership you may have other

00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:57,180
goals but again this is what we've been

00:09:55,320 --> 00:10:01,170
able to establish as the four main

00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:04,470
reasons why people are sponsoring drupal

00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:06,060
cons so just to touch on all of them a

00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:09,480
bit and you know just to add a little

00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:12,060
bit of pieces of advice so if your main

00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:13,770
goal is business acquisition meaning

00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:16,380
you're looking for new business or

00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:18,960
you're trying to tap into a new audience

00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:20,730
the first thing you want to do or the

00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:24,960
way you want to think about it is you

00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:28,050
know people are if your Drupal agency or

00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:30,060
an agency that builds websites these

00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:31,800
site owners are attending drupalcon

00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:33,870
because they're trying to learn about

00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:37,230
Drupal they're trying to see if Drupal

00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:39,110
itself is the solution they've been

00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:42,140
after so you want to start out with

00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:44,130
selling Drupal first and then yourself

00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:45,660
there's going to be a lot of other

00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:50,510
people that offer the exact same

00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:52,050
services as you you know they-they-they

00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:55,709
to

00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:58,470
build websites using Drupal or they to

00:10:55,709 --> 00:11:00,959
have software that integrates with

00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:02,730
Drupal and so what you want to start out

00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:06,240
with is what separates Drupal from the

00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:09,360
rest of the CMS market and then start

00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:12,870
talking about how you or what separates

00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:20,399
you if you're a software company that

00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:23,010
integrates with Drupal focus more on how

00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:27,810
you can enhance Drupal or how can you

00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:29,940
help these developers or these agencies

00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:33,390
move up the stack because a lot of these

00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:35,070
agencies are these developers get into

00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:38,190
business because they want to work on

00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:40,290
Drupal they don't want to focus on all

00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:42,329
the steps in between that gets their

00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:44,670
team or gets themselves working with

00:11:42,329 --> 00:11:46,470
Drupal the platform that I like so you

00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:48,120
know talk about how you can move them up

00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:52,800
the stack to get them doing what they

00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:55,740
love to do if your goal is business

00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:58,529
development meaning you are just trying

00:11:55,740 --> 00:12:01,410
to deepen the relationship with your

00:11:58,529 --> 00:12:04,649
really existing clients or you are

00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:06,779
working on moving some potential

00:12:04,649 --> 00:12:10,079
customers down that pipeline to finally

00:12:06,779 --> 00:12:12,870
make that commitment towards Drupal this

00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:15,839
is your into opportunity to be there

00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:20,180
Drupal ambassador and to really showcase

00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:22,529
firsthand what Drupal is all about and

00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:26,670
more specifically what the Drupal

00:12:22,529 --> 00:12:28,740
community is all about so I always say

00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:31,770
it's so important to just invite them in

00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:33,990
invite your clients invite your the

00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:36,839
companies that are within your working

00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:38,640
in your pipeline pipeline because them

00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:41,430
attending and drupalcon could be the

00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:45,899
difference between with them going on a

00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:47,880
different tool versus you so when you do

00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:49,440
bring them in as I mentioned you want to

00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:52,019
bring their impact you want to be there

00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:54,899
Drupal ambassador you can do this by

00:12:52,019 --> 00:12:57,329
showing off your presence within the

00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:59,220
Drupal community if you brought them

00:12:57,329 --> 00:13:01,350
along this far they've already

00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:03,810
considered Drupal so now this is your

00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:05,670
opportunity to make yourself stand out

00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:08,490
so if you're you

00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:11,550
have some team members that are

00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:13,470
presenting sessions or you're putting on

00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:15,900
some trainings or you're chaining boss

00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:18,210
you know bring them in show them that

00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:20,580
you are truly invested in that you are a

00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:25,560
leader within the community and that you

00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:28,590
are the right business to go with don't

00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:31,230
be afraid to show off this is your

00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:36,240
opportunity to stand out from the crowd

00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:41,430
and you know help them show or help show

00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:43,440
them a good time the next goal is going

00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:46,230
to be networking in partnership so

00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:48,900
networking most people know about so

00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:52,800
just do what makes it unique to

00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:54,870
drupalcon is you know a lot of the

00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:58,740
networking happening happens here is

00:13:54,870 --> 00:14:00,210
peer-to-peer networking because as I've

00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:02,720
mentioned in quite a bit of times now

00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:05,160
the Drupal community is large its global

00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:09,390
so sometimes you just need to pick the

00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:12,330
brains of your fellow Drupal agencies

00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:14,550
that are operating across the globe you

00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:18,120
know what has worked for them what's not

00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:20,940
working for them and then you can start

00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:24,530
building these relationships that may or

00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:27,780
may not lead to future potential spot

00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:31,320
partnerships we've seen this happen in

00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:34,320
this past quite a bit actually agencies

00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:36,630
partnering with other ages these to

00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:40,260
expand the reach whether it's you know

00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:44,280
to expand their reach globally or to

00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:47,370
expand the reach by increasing their

00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:50,070
product base or the resource base or if

00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:52,460
you're a software and you're really

00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:55,200
trying to tap into the market you know

00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:56,850
sometimes you need a Drupal pro or

00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:59,280
Drupal an ambassador to partner with

00:14:56,850 --> 00:15:02,040
before you go to market so this is a

00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:04,800
great opportunity to do so some have you

00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:07,680
seen who's coming are I have you looked

00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:11,310
to see who's sponsoring do your research

00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:14,670
beforehand so you know who you're so you

00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:17,850
can actively seek out these people while

00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:19,400
you're at drupalcon rather than wasting

00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:21,230
time figuring out who's there

00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:25,820
and then having to follow up in a less

00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:30,020
personal way after the fact if your goal

00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:33,200
is for talent recruitment I thank you

00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:35,180
reach the right place because the you

00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:37,070
know Drupal developers are highly

00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:41,150
intelligent you know it's a pretty

00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:43,010
unique talent base and if you are in

00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:45,850
need of Drupal developers there's really

00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:50,120
no better way or no better place to be

00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:51,650
then drupalcon because really the

00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:54,530
developers that are attending all the

00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:58,390
ones that are you know fully committed

00:15:54,530 --> 00:16:01,520
to Drupal so you're going to be not only

00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:03,890
reaching being efficient with reaching a

00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:06,620
drupal developer base but you're going

00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:09,980
to be reaching top notch base of Drupal

00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:13,940
developers so if you are hiring make it

00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:15,770
known that you're hiring this is why

00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:18,230
many people sponsors so if you're

00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:20,180
sponsoring no don't just market your

00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:22,700
company saying hey here's my brand be

00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:24,620
like in my brand and the reason why our

00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:28,310
sponsoring is because we're hiring let

00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:31,700
us talk to you and when people and they

00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:34,250
come prepared with the jobs that you're

00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:36,200
hiring so don't only make it known that

00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:38,480
you're hiring but make it known for

00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:41,080
which jobs you are hiring for because

00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:43,790
there's going to be a lot of people that

00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:48,440
already work for different agencies or

00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:50,860
work as you know independent contractors

00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:53,300
so if they just know right off the bat

00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:55,880
that you are hiring for a specific

00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:57,890
position it makes it easier for them to

00:16:55,880 --> 00:17:03,530
come to you because it's always easier

00:16:57,890 --> 00:17:05,480
for you you know to reach a new base if

00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:07,900
they are seeking you out rather than

00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:12,140
wasting time for you to come to them so

00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:14,330
keep that in mind I mean if you're there

00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:17,089
for Team strengthening which a lot of

00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:19,730
companies do because again this is a

00:17:17,089 --> 00:17:22,060
Drupal specific event so there's going

00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:26,600
to be a lot of Drupal agencies or

00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:30,530
agencies that offer Drupal out there so

00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:32,960
this is just their opportunity to show

00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:34,970
your employees that you

00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:37,159
are committed in Drupal you're committed

00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:39,380
to investing in Drupal and you're

00:17:37,159 --> 00:17:43,669
committed to investing in their personal

00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:47,080
and professional well-being so if you're

00:17:43,669 --> 00:17:47,080
bringing them in show them a good time

00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:53,270
and I always just say bring them in like

00:17:50,929 --> 00:18:01,279
bring everyone in the more people that

00:17:53,270 --> 00:18:03,679
you have the better the next goal that

00:18:01,279 --> 00:18:07,580
we see as a common reason people sponsor

00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:10,779
is to really just just demonstrate their

00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:15,409
community and thought leadership within

00:18:10,779 --> 00:18:17,240
within the Drupal atmosphere many people

00:18:15,409 --> 00:18:19,130
are sponsoring just because they want to

00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:21,909
have an opportunity to give back and

00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:24,740
show that their community that they are

00:18:21,909 --> 00:18:26,149
committed so if this is something that

00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:29,360
if this is the reason why you are

00:18:26,149 --> 00:18:31,399
sponsoring be a part of the conversation

00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:33,230
don't stand in the back and let the

00:18:31,399 --> 00:18:39,140
conversation and fold in front of you

00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:42,049
you know join in give your input join in

00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:47,809
on these sessions attend these box go to

00:18:42,049 --> 00:18:52,100
the sprint hold outings really push the

00:18:47,809 --> 00:18:55,789
conversation for words hmm and if you

00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:58,179
are new to the community but this is

00:18:55,789 --> 00:19:01,070
something that you're kind of aiming for

00:18:58,179 --> 00:19:04,250
learn how you can get involved look at

00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:06,380
the programming schedule or ask fellow

00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:08,929
community members or fellow businesses

00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:13,039
what they have done to become a

00:19:08,929 --> 00:19:19,419
community or thought leader within the

00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:23,720
Drupal atmosphere next step or the next

00:19:19,419 --> 00:19:30,930
step I want to touch on is defining your

00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:31,890
message so you want to Jay

00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:33,030
like you want to define your goals

00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:34,710
before you come in you want to define

00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:37,830
your message before you come into

00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:40,260
drupalcon so you do this by knowing

00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:42,780
first knowing who you want to talk to

00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:46,250
you know your company better than I do

00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:49,020
so have this established and then

00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:51,840
research you know learn what they want

00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:54,210
to hear if you're here to hire

00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:57,360
developers the developers want to know

00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:58,740
what's new with Drupal or how can I be

00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:01,290
better with Drupal because they're

00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:03,330
either here to see what's out on the

00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:07,560
market or they're here for a

00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:12,300
professional development them to develop

00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:14,910
their professional skills so you know

00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:17,730
cater tailor your message this you know

00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:20,490
this is what's new this is how you can

00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:24,240
be better and kind of approach it with a

00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:26,670
mindset of they are looking for what can

00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:29,100
you teach me so again going back to the

00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:30,870
whole contributing module they've

00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:32,820
contribute a lot of time and that

00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:36,480
resources to Drupal now it's your turn

00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:39,090
to contribute back to them and you can

00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:42,510
what you can contribute is resource

00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:45,510
knowledge or tools and if you're looking

00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:47,730
at higher you know why they're probably

00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:50,100
looking wondering why should I work for

00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:51,990
you so come with that mindset come with

00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:57,660
a mindset that you want to really cater

00:20:51,990 --> 00:21:00,210
to your audience if you are if your goal

00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:04,500
is to talk to Drupal agency so you are a

00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:07,830
a software integrator or a hosting

00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:11,190
company you know I can't touch on this

00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:13,710
already before but focus on how you can

00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:17,880
help move them up the stack how can you

00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:21,480
enhance Drupal how can you make it so

00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:25,290
their developers or doing what they do

00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:29,400
best and that's work on Drupal or build

00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:32,210
amazing websites for anyone and if you

00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:35,580
are an agency in your after site owners

00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:38,460
you know they want to know why Drupal

00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:41,370
they're attending Drupal because they

00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:43,040
have an idea this may be the platform

00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:47,150
that they go with

00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:49,220
build a website on but you know they are

00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:52,340
obviously invest are there obviously

00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:56,710
committed into learning more about it so

00:21:52,340 --> 00:22:02,090
speed that resource come prepared with

00:21:56,710 --> 00:22:04,550
the set of selling points on what makes

00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:06,860
Drupal better than the rest or why

00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:10,190
Drupal is a solution for their current

00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:13,310
project and then why you why are you

00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:16,040
credible why should this site owner

00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:18,350
choose you to develop their website for

00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:21,730
them and the way you can do that is just

00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:25,610
show off your credibility sort of just

00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:28,280
sort of if like when I touch on you know

00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:30,530
business development if they're

00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:34,730
attending and you meet them bring them

00:22:30,530 --> 00:22:36,290
in show that you are a leader have the

00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:38,000
mat in your sessions have them within

00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:41,930
your trainings and prove your

00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:44,630
credibility within the community last

00:22:41,930 --> 00:22:46,940
step out you to have establish who you

00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:48,340
want to talk to you've researched them

00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:51,140
you know what they want to hear

00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:55,850
determine how you will get them to hear

00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:59,840
you this means you know are you going to

00:22:55,850 --> 00:23:01,610
want to do one-on-one interactions so

00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:03,800
you just want to blast your logo out

00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:07,580
there so people remember you when they

00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:12,170
are scouring the web later on or do you

00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:14,630
want to build a lead a database so you

00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:17,690
can reach them through an email campaign

00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:20,780
later on whatever it is how these

00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:24,920
mediums in mind and create your

00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:27,170
marketing campaign around that so your

00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:28,970
marketing campaign or your your project

00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:30,830
for this drupalcon is to click leave

00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:33,230
make sure you have the necessary tools

00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:36,260
and resources to collect those leaves

00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:38,990
and to follow up with and if you're just

00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:43,610
there to for branding purposes make sure

00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:47,620
you have you no items to hand out or

00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:51,140
your logo is consistent however maybe

00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:53,360
prepare ahead of time and you know keep

00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:57,440
in mind that no one wants to really be

00:23:53,360 --> 00:24:00,660
sold to you can sell to them because

00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:02,460
obviously that's you know part of the

00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:07,200
sponsorship process but don't make it

00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:09,270
that obvious you know keep that mindset

00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:15,150
and I keep that what can you do for them

00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:18,600
mindset and play here the next step I

00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:21,090
want to touch on that will help you have

00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:23,970
a successful and valuable time at

00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:25,740
rubicon is to be proactive I made a

00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:28,440
little side note here be proactive

00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:30,450
before and after some we already touched

00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:32,370
on that you know you want to set your

00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:35,010
goals messaging before you attend

00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:38,010
drupalcon but it's important that you

00:24:35,010 --> 00:24:44,340
share these goals and messages to your

00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:46,500
team the more people you bring the

00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:49,440
larger the presence you will have a

00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:53,640
drupalcon because drupalcon expands much

00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:55,970
further beyond the exhibit hall or show

00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:58,230
floor so more people you have

00:24:55,970 --> 00:25:00,660
representing your company wearing your

00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:04,950
brand the better but this also means

00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:07,950
that the more chances that you can the

00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:10,290
more the greater the chance that there

00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:13,170
can be some inconsistencies so train

00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:15,420
your team let them know what your goals

00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:18,480
are let me know what your messages are

00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:20,820
you know you can do this by you know

00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:23,580
holding a pre conference meeting or

00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:26,340
sending out an email to them letting

00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:30,210
them know hey this is what we're doing

00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:33,450
here please keep this in mind and no

00:25:30,210 --> 00:25:35,310
train them to be an ambassador for your

00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:39,570
company have them attend the Sprint's

00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:41,610
have them attend sessions and show your

00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:45,300
company logo off with proud or show

00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:49,320
they're proud to work for you and if you

00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:53,340
don't see anyone that you want to you

00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:56,580
know talk to or you're not sure if they

00:25:53,340 --> 00:26:01,890
will be there invite them we have the

00:25:56,580 --> 00:26:04,770
community page on the event website it

00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:08,100
you know has a list of all the people

00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:09,870
have opted in to be public that you

00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:11,760
see who's coming and you can literally

00:26:09,870 --> 00:26:13,470
reach out to them directly through them

00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:16,559
and let them know that you're going to

00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:18,270
be there so it means you know it's

00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:20,970
important for you to be accessible to

00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:23,220
because sometimes you know you may be

00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:25,590
the target you may be the audience that

00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:28,410
someone is looking for it's always

00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:30,390
easier for someone to find you to

00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:32,280
establish relationships rather than you

00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:35,360
having to find them to build our

00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:38,400
relationship so BSS will be ready and

00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:42,720
have your various outlets out there that

00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:46,320
people can connect with you beforehand

00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:48,390
set up meetings this is always better to

00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:50,600
have your customers or your audience

00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:54,030
waiting for you rather than having to

00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:56,909
find them at joke on because if you find

00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:58,710
them too late you know there's nothing

00:26:56,909 --> 00:27:01,080
you can do but follow up at a later time

00:26:58,710 --> 00:27:02,820
and so if you set these meetings it's

00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:06,179
really your chance to take advantage of

00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:08,640
being in dublin in this great city and

00:27:06,179 --> 00:27:12,030
if you have other goals in mind you know

00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:14,370
team strengthening or just a community

00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:16,559
and thought leadership host of social

00:27:14,370 --> 00:27:19,140
outing or just go out explore their town

00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:23,429
bring the team show everyone a good time

00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:27,419
or show you know demonstrate that you

00:27:23,429 --> 00:27:29,429
are you know that you are a leader and

00:27:27,419 --> 00:27:31,860
that you're willing to invest in not

00:27:29,429 --> 00:27:34,440
only the educational content but you

00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:36,480
know the social well-being of people so

00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:39,000
set up these meetings or social outings

00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:41,880
beforehand reservations are going to

00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,380
start getting full here if you have any

00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:47,730
experience that ready so take the time

00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:49,530
to go ahead and do that and then lastly

00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:51,780
just know how you're going to follow up

00:27:49,530 --> 00:27:53,400
so if you're hiring know how you're

00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:56,100
going to follow up with your potential

00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:58,280
hires if you're looking for clients know

00:27:56,100 --> 00:28:01,440
how you're going to follow up with them

00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:04,080
and again build your campaign and build

00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:07,049
your tools to cater to this so you don't

00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:12,330
need a waste time scrambling together to

00:28:07,049 --> 00:28:15,750
put together a an email that you know is

00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:19,140
not as well thought as so do this all

00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:21,620
before hand and keep it in mind for

00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:21,620
afterwards

00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:30,790
alright so now I really just want to

00:28:26,890 --> 00:28:32,800
talk about taking advantage of drupalcon

00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:36,010
this is what really makes it unique

00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:37,930
again all those other steps of success

00:28:36,010 --> 00:28:39,580
you you probably have those well

00:28:37,930 --> 00:28:44,130
established you can carry those along

00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:46,930
with you to any other event but

00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:50,920
specifically at rubicon the things that

00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:54,280
we ask that you can focus our that we

00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:56,200
provide for you to focus on is one would

00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:59,770
be your booth so if you're a correspond

00:28:56,200 --> 00:29:01,390
sir diamond platinum gold silver bronze

00:28:59,770 --> 00:29:05,890
you're going to be exhibiting on the

00:29:01,390 --> 00:29:08,290
show floor we've provided or we've

00:29:05,890 --> 00:29:10,900
teamed up with a few exhibitor partners

00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:13,630
exhibiting services partners to help you

00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:18,010
really take advantage and maximize your

00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:21,730
presence there on the show for the first

00:29:18,010 --> 00:29:24,490
being a huge total Expo they're going to

00:29:21,730 --> 00:29:27,929
be your resources for renting and

00:29:24,490 --> 00:29:33,390
ordering any furniture so it's couches

00:29:27,929 --> 00:29:38,950
stands bookshelves lighting spotlights

00:29:33,390 --> 00:29:41,800
any displays so TV stands monitors they

00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:46,000
have a variety of sizes and you can even

00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:48,550
worked with him to build custom booths

00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:51,370
so you can start from the ground up and

00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:56,770
build a grand setup that will really

00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:58,870
help you stand out from the rest um and

00:29:56,770 --> 00:30:00,429
you know they're really accessible and

00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:03,670
they ask that you reach out with them

00:30:00,429 --> 00:30:06,160
directly because it's always easier to

00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:10,330
do it that way and then you can even

00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:12,700
help you with design elements so being

00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:15,250
that this e these are shell scheme

00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:17,770
boosts you can work with them to have

00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:20,620
your design elements displayed on the

00:30:17,770 --> 00:30:23,440
walls of your Bruce so you know they are

00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:28,929
great they're pros at what they do don't

00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:31,590
be afraid to reach out to them then our

00:30:28,929 --> 00:30:33,380
next partner is going to be CCD the

00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:35,840
division conventions

00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:40,010
themselves they're going to be a charge

00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:41,630
of catering or hardwired internet and I

00:30:40,010 --> 00:30:44,270
like to always point out catering

00:30:41,630 --> 00:30:46,340
because if you want people to come to

00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:48,800
your booth you know give them a reason

00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:51,470
to come most people are going to be

00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:53,510
hungry or they're going to want a drink

00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:58,700
before they go out and this is your

00:30:53,510 --> 00:31:02,600
opportunity to do so really your booth

00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:04,730
is a platform it's a frame you get a

00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:07,370
couple table or you get a table maybe a

00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:09,920
couple tables and some chairs and the

00:31:07,370 --> 00:31:13,580
freedom and flexibility to go from there

00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:16,130
is really up to you and you have these

00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:18,530
two tools you can decorate it you can

00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:20,530
use catering to really drive audience or

00:31:18,530 --> 00:31:24,110
drive the tinnies directly to your booth

00:31:20,530 --> 00:31:26,630
and the last partner we have is

00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:29,810
interflow logistics are going to be in

00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:34,270

00:31:29,810 --> 00:31:37,550
outbound shipping handling and a

00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:41,960

00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:46,280
huge whole Expo or you have your own

00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:48,770
little stacks that you want to bring in

00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:51,020
this is your opportunity to ship them

00:31:48,770 --> 00:31:54,650
you can ship them to the advanced

00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:57,560
warehouse managed by interflow so when

00:31:54,650 --> 00:31:59,600
you arrive at the event on monday to set

00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:03,500
up

00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:06,169
their designated at your booth we in the

00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:09,730
vacant we've provided your own custom

00:32:06,169 --> 00:32:13,130
shipping labels so it's all ready to go

00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:15,650
an inner flow is happy to help you with

00:32:13,130 --> 00:32:18,169
any custom shipping and handling needs

00:32:15,650 --> 00:32:21,700
just reach out to them I sent to

00:32:18,169 --> 00:32:23,990
everyone the sponsor event kit this is

00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:26,120
where you can find all the information

00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:30,530
contact information for all three of our

00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:33,919
partners next thing won't touch on

00:32:30,530 --> 00:32:36,620
already the brakes so there are various

00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:42,860
breaks throughout the conference in

00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:45,049
which traffic will be very heavy in the

00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:48,230
exhibit hall so these are the times you

00:32:45,049 --> 00:32:50,419
want to be fully staffed prepared first

00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:52,850
one is not necessarily a break but i do

00:32:50,419 --> 00:32:56,809
want to mention it's important so on

00:32:52,850 --> 00:33:00,200
monday night there will be the opening

00:32:56,809 --> 00:33:02,900
reception and this is probably one of

00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:04,490
the most highly trafficked bid events

00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:06,440
for the exhibit hall just because

00:33:04,490 --> 00:33:09,919
there's no other content of programming

00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:11,960
happening on at that time and nothing

00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:15,320
draws a crowd like free drinks and free

00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:18,650
food so this is going to be a fun event

00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:20,360
I'll touch more on it later but this

00:33:18,650 --> 00:33:24,049
means that you want to be fully staffed

00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:28,100
and fully prepared at 17 o'clock on this

00:33:24,049 --> 00:33:33,830
Monday so you're setting up on a Monday

00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:37,070
beginning at noon be ready by 17 each

00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:38,450
day on Tuesday and Tuesday through

00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:40,700
Thursday there are going to be two

00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:43,220
coffee breaks in which we provide free

00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:49,539
coffee there's me one in the morning and

00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:49,539
one in the afternoon these ones

00:33:50,179 --> 00:33:55,159
do dry quite a bit of traffic because

00:33:52,309 --> 00:33:57,619
these are long this is a long conference

00:33:55,159 --> 00:33:59,240
and people need their caffeine and then

00:33:57,619 --> 00:34:00,980
what's new this year is that we're

00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:05,320
actually going to have to lunch breaks

00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:07,940
or back-to-back so from 12 to 11 22

00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:12,230
there will be two different lunch breaks

00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:14,329
and this is to really help people pick

00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:17,990
and choose their schedules that not have

00:34:14,329 --> 00:34:21,500
to stick to a strict timeline and also

00:34:17,990 --> 00:34:23,270
helps the flow of traffic to the exhibit

00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:26,240
hall rather than having to get everyone

00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:32,480
at once and you know potentially miss an

00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:35,270
opportunity it's a your chance to you

00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:37,490
know get a little bit more personal

00:34:35,270 --> 00:34:39,470
approach to it and then there's going to

00:34:37,490 --> 00:34:44,659
be the short session delays which are

00:34:39,470 --> 00:34:53,470
only 15 minutes from 1145 to noon to two

00:34:44,659 --> 00:34:57,309
2 15 and 60 45 to 17 so essentially from

00:34:53,470 --> 00:35:04,490
if you appreciate here from about noon

00:34:57,309 --> 00:35:08,450
to 14 o'clock or 14 15 the exhibit hall

00:35:04,490 --> 00:35:10,670
is going to be pretty busy so get your

00:35:08,450 --> 00:35:13,910
lunch in determine you know you know

00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:17,359
take break shift breaks and then when

00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:20,030
the brakes aren't happening traffic will

00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:22,160
slow down but this is your chance to

00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:24,079
really network with your fellow sponsors

00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:26,930
I can't stress enough how important that

00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:29,900
is whether it's just you want to pick

00:35:26,930 --> 00:35:31,760
their brains or you know you you've done

00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:33,980
your research and you see some potential

00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:36,190
partner offers our partnership

00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:38,380
opportunities

00:35:36,190 --> 00:35:39,970
this is your chance to do so scour the

00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:44,230
exhibit hall you know learn from them

00:35:39,970 --> 00:35:46,230
it's your turn to be in attendee you can

00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:48,970
find the exhibit a whole map and

00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:51,760
exhibitor list on the website there's a

00:35:48,970 --> 00:35:59,230
URL but it's in the drop down menu as

00:35:51,760 --> 00:36:01,890
well so beyond the exhibit hall there's

00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:05,260
a wide range of programming happening

00:36:01,890 --> 00:36:08,319
for you to take advantage of as you know

00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:12,099
not only as a sponsor but as an attendee

00:36:08,319 --> 00:36:15,520
and I touched on it before but there's a

00:36:12,099 --> 00:36:17,770
lot happen mean beyond the show for for

00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:21,369
you to take advantage so the more people

00:36:17,770 --> 00:36:24,040
use in the larger presence you have and

00:36:21,369 --> 00:36:26,890
the more great are the more of an impact

00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:28,750
you can have as first thing I want to

00:36:26,890 --> 00:36:29,980
talk about are the summit's that we have

00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:34,569
happening these are going to be

00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:37,089
happening on Monday sep number 26 most

00:36:34,569 --> 00:36:40,390
of them will start at 9am some of them

00:36:37,089 --> 00:36:44,319
will start at ten a.m. and we'll have

00:36:40,390 --> 00:36:48,089
three summits this year the first one is

00:36:44,319 --> 00:36:52,569
the business summit this is really a

00:36:48,089 --> 00:36:54,430
more of a gathering of the Drupal

00:36:52,569 --> 00:36:58,270
business leaders within the communities

00:36:54,430 --> 00:37:01,569
so if you are a sponsor it's important

00:36:58,270 --> 00:37:04,930
that you senior leadership within your

00:37:01,569 --> 00:37:08,500
company to the business summit so they

00:37:04,930 --> 00:37:11,680
can not only network with the leaders

00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:13,720
within a Drupal community but I you know

00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:16,270
learn from them learn what they're doing

00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:18,880
well whether what what you know the

00:37:16,270 --> 00:37:20,800
trials and errors that they've had and

00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:24,160
for you to show off your what you've

00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:27,670
done your case studies so this is really

00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:32,020
going to be more designed for leadership

00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:35,050
within agencies consultancies or web

00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:38,890
development businesses so please try to

00:37:35,050 --> 00:37:41,319
keep that in mind you know there is no

00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:42,660
selling that happens here this is

00:37:41,319 --> 00:37:47,200
supposed to be a comfortable atmosphere

00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:49,560
and if you abuse this you will be asked

00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,560
to leave

00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:57,059
the next summit is the DevOps image

00:37:53,069 --> 00:37:59,160
which is brand new this year I mean it's

00:37:57,059 --> 00:38:01,319
pretty straightforward on what the topic

00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:04,980
is can be is going to be dead DevOps so

00:38:01,319 --> 00:38:08,069
whoever is interested in discussing how

00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:10,349
they implement their debt own develop

00:38:08,069 --> 00:38:14,240
principles or learn how other companies

00:38:10,349 --> 00:38:16,520
are doing so or learn about new tools or

00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:19,559
software out there to help their

00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:22,559
development operations run smoother this

00:38:19,559 --> 00:38:26,880
is who should attend so let's go from

00:38:22,559 --> 00:38:31,109
developers site administrators from CTO

00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:34,589
such as general technologists or nerves

00:38:31,109 --> 00:38:37,559
as I like to say I want to join in and

00:38:34,589 --> 00:38:39,119
be a part of the conversation so if you

00:38:37,559 --> 00:38:42,809
want to expand your reach you know maybe

00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:45,869
you send your CTO here or you senior

00:38:42,809 --> 00:38:48,960
developers so they can bring back this

00:38:45,869 --> 00:38:52,680
knowledge is to you the last summit

00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:56,039
happening is the community summit this

00:38:52,680 --> 00:39:01,130
is going to be for anyone who's a Drupal

00:38:56,039 --> 00:39:05,400
community manager or a camp or meet up a

00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:08,640
host or organizer or if you want to

00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:10,529
sponsor future camps or future meetups

00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:12,240

00:39:10,529 --> 00:39:14,520
how you can make a difference how you

00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:19,650
can contribute and you guys can pick

00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:21,299
each other's minds and on how you can

00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:24,569
make a large impact in your local

00:39:21,299 --> 00:39:26,430
community or your camper made up this is

00:39:24,569 --> 00:39:30,119
free to attend so you know might as well

00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:32,160
send some people the other programming

00:39:30,119 --> 00:39:35,819
feature we have or the trainings this is

00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:43,319
really your opportunity if your goal is

00:39:35,819 --> 00:39:46,529

00:39:43,319 --> 00:39:48,359
or to strengthen your developers send

00:39:46,529 --> 00:39:52,079
them to your trainings we offer

00:39:48,359 --> 00:39:54,740
something for everyone you know from

00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:57,390
beginners from intermediate to

00:39:54,740 --> 00:40:00,660
experience from front end from DevOps

00:39:57,390 --> 00:40:03,480
from symphony there's a range of

00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:04,380
opportunities there and you're going to

00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:05,880
be learning from the

00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:10,559
best because these trainings were

00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:12,380
community selected and so they had to go

00:40:10,559 --> 00:40:14,970
through a process so the people that are

00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:19,559
giving these trainings are pros they've

00:40:14,970 --> 00:40:21,630
done this before and again this is your

00:40:19,559 --> 00:40:24,289
opportunity to expand your reach even

00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:28,799
further by sending in your developers

00:40:24,289 --> 00:40:32,099
you know show them that your show the

00:40:28,799 --> 00:40:34,529
community that you're invested in Drupal

00:40:32,099 --> 00:40:39,140
by having them wary branded shirt to the

00:40:34,529 --> 00:40:41,809
training or show potential hires that

00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:44,430
you know you're willing to invest

00:40:41,809 --> 00:40:48,839
financially in their personal and

00:40:44,430 --> 00:40:50,759
professional development the next

00:40:48,839 --> 00:40:53,819
programming feature we have our boss

00:40:50,759 --> 00:40:56,190
also known as birds of feathers if

00:40:53,819 --> 00:41:03,660
you're unfamiliar with boss boss are not

00:40:56,190 --> 00:41:06,960
a presentation or a lead lead topic it's

00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:11,240
more of a conversation between people

00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:16,170
that are share similar interests in a

00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:18,509
shared topic or some topic that people

00:41:16,170 --> 00:41:22,079
are passionate about that they need some

00:41:18,509 --> 00:41:24,539
space to discuss face-to-face bout this

00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:27,210
is a great opportunity to come in and

00:41:24,539 --> 00:41:37,230
demonstrate your leadership because it

00:41:27,210 --> 00:41:39,599
is a vocal a vocal conversation I guess

00:41:37,230 --> 00:41:41,210
the best way to put it where you know

00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:44,700
this is your chance to have your input

00:41:41,210 --> 00:41:47,730
to say something or to contribute a

00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:51,630
piece of knowledge to a topic that you

00:41:47,730 --> 00:41:54,269
do care about and you know this you can

striving to increase this you know not

00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:53,590
just in Drupal but throughout the tech

00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:56,350

00:47:06,190 --> 00:47:10,930
next thing that I want to point out is

00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:13,270
really more focused on your sponsorship

00:47:10,930 --> 00:47:16,930
and that's the appreciation happy hour

00:47:13,270 --> 00:47:19,090
this is a gathering of the most

00:47:16,930 --> 00:47:23,980
influential people within the Drupal

00:47:19,090 --> 00:47:30,820
community whether their agency owners

00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:33,060
uh important contributors companies

00:47:30,820 --> 00:47:38,460
drupal association supporting partners

00:47:33,060 --> 00:47:40,990
and then there a gathering of all the

00:47:38,460 --> 00:47:43,630
leadership within the sponsorships

00:47:40,990 --> 00:47:49,470
because a part of your sponsorship you

00:47:43,630 --> 00:47:52,450
were given a couple of RSVPs to attend

00:47:49,470 --> 00:47:55,140
this is probably one of the top

00:47:52,450 --> 00:47:58,720
networking events that happen at

00:47:55,140 --> 00:48:04,210
drupalcon it's going to happen Wednesday

00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:06,400
it's going to happen at a location that

00:48:04,210 --> 00:48:09,910
is to be announced just because we try

00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:12,119
to keep it sort of exclusive there's

00:48:09,910 --> 00:48:16,810
going to be free drinks and free call

00:48:12,119 --> 00:48:18,580
snacks but if you have an RSVP dear

00:48:16,810 --> 00:48:20,260
leadership or the people that you would

00:48:18,580 --> 00:48:23,740
like to represent your company yet

00:48:20,260 --> 00:48:27,810
please do so if you go to the vent kit

00:48:23,740 --> 00:48:31,450
there's an RSVP link or web form for you

00:48:27,810 --> 00:48:34,150
I I can't stress enough how important it

00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:36,580
is that your company has some sort of

00:48:34,150 --> 00:48:41,200
presence here we've seen some major

00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:45,460
business or some you know large

00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:48,100
partnerships start from this single

00:48:45,460 --> 00:48:51,810
event and if you just want to have a fun

00:48:48,100 --> 00:48:57,220
time it is fun you're surrounded by

00:48:51,810 --> 00:48:59,260
leaders within the community and it's

00:48:57,220 --> 00:49:01,780
your chance to just meet them get to

00:48:59,260 --> 00:49:06,630
know them and pick each other brain or

00:49:01,780 --> 00:49:11,230
just relax because if you're a CEO or

00:49:06,630 --> 00:49:12,760
you're CTO is attending drupalcon they

00:49:11,230 --> 00:49:14,650
probably have a pretty busy schedule

00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:18,840
this is a chance for them to wind down

00:49:14,650 --> 00:49:21,369
and you know enjoy themselves a bit a

00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:23,410
little bit more lighter note the last

00:49:21,369 --> 00:49:28,510
thing we have is trivia night this

00:49:23,410 --> 00:49:32,260
happens on Thursday septum or 29th of

00:49:28,510 --> 00:49:34,450
the manch in a house down on Dawson

00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:37,060
Street this is free to everyone and

00:49:34,450 --> 00:49:42,220
probably the most fun event

00:49:37,060 --> 00:49:47,670
of the entire conference to open to

00:49:42,220 --> 00:49:51,550
everyone and if you've never been to one

00:49:47,670 --> 00:49:54,330
go to this one it's a chance for people

00:49:51,550 --> 00:49:59,260
to show off their Drupal knowledge and

00:49:54,330 --> 00:50:02,950
really just wind down from the the past

00:49:59,260 --> 00:50:05,370
event schedule that they've been on yeah

00:50:02,950 --> 00:50:08,560
I can't explain enough how fun this is

00:50:05,370 --> 00:50:11,200
you need to attend and this year's even

00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:13,840
more special because this originally was

00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:16,000
put together by the Drupal Ireland

00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:17,680
community and this is their time to

00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:20,400
bring it home so you know they're going

00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:23,530
to go big they're going to go bad and

00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:25,270
you should have you should come and if

00:50:23,530 --> 00:50:28,240
you don't want to come you know send

00:50:25,270 --> 00:50:30,460
your developers send your team and have

00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:33,730
them represent your team by oh you know

00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:37,180
wearing a company shirt again you know

00:50:33,730 --> 00:50:39,220
show that you're committed I can't

00:50:37,180 --> 00:50:42,040
stress enough of how important this is

00:50:39,220 --> 00:50:46,480
for you know just for your social

00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:47,920
well-being to attend this the events

00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:51,820
that we don't put on but that are

00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:55,000
happening are going to be the parties

00:50:51,820 --> 00:50:57,670
the meetups and any team outings there's

00:50:55,000 --> 00:51:02,170
sponsored parties happening throughout

00:50:57,670 --> 00:51:03,700
the event happening around Dublin if you

00:51:02,170 --> 00:51:06,940
want to see what's happening just check

00:51:03,700 --> 00:51:09,850
the social events calendar you know as

00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:11,710
much networking that happens on during

00:51:09,850 --> 00:51:13,960
the drupal con just as much happens

00:51:11,710 --> 00:51:15,370
outside of it and if you want to ensure

00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:19,120
you're in the right place at the right

00:51:15,370 --> 00:51:21,400
time you know have your company or have

00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:23,080
your employees attend these events not

00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:26,530
only is it a good time but it's your

00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:28,810
chance to meet these people in a setting

00:51:26,530 --> 00:51:34,540
that is less professional or less

00:51:28,810 --> 00:51:36,070
serious and you know in a time where

00:51:34,540 --> 00:51:40,210
people are going to be more open and

00:51:36,070 --> 00:51:42,370
having a good time and if you don't see

00:51:40,210 --> 00:51:46,810
one you know that you want to attend

00:51:42,370 --> 00:51:48,370
this is your opportunity to host one we

00:51:46,810 --> 00:51:50,900
see the same companies sponsoring

00:51:48,370 --> 00:51:54,950
parties every year because they see

00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:58,490
that it truly does make an impact on

00:51:54,950 --> 00:52:00,890
their presence and on their branding

00:51:58,490 --> 00:52:03,440
campaigns so does it have to be open to

00:52:00,890 --> 00:52:04,970
everyone you can have it small ones you

00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:07,880
can a hat you can have a large grand

00:52:04,970 --> 00:52:12,010
ones it can be specifically designed for

00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:14,930
people that you've met within the

00:52:12,010 --> 00:52:18,230
rubicon or for the clients that you've

00:52:14,930 --> 00:52:20,599
brought in whatever it is you have you

00:52:18,230 --> 00:52:23,839
know Dublin is your platform take full

00:52:20,599 --> 00:52:26,059
advantage of it the second thing are the

00:52:23,839 --> 00:52:27,740
meetups that happen the various meetups

00:52:26,059 --> 00:52:31,130
that are happening throughout drupalcon

00:52:27,740 --> 00:52:32,720
or throughout Dublin these are going to

00:52:31,130 --> 00:52:35,960
be more focused on people I want to keep

00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:38,480
the conversations going so if you were a

00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:40,970
part of the DevOps summit for example

00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:44,059
and you want to have continued this

00:52:40,970 --> 00:52:46,460
conversation on ah after drupalcon but

00:52:44,059 --> 00:52:48,680
in a more social setting you can find me

00:52:46,460 --> 00:52:54,079
