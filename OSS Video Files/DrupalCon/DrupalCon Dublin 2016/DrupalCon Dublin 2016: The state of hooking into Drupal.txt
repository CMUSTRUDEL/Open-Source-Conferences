When to alter and when to fire an event.
How to create and dispatch an Event from your module.
How to listen or subscribe to an Event from your custom Event or an event from core.
How to expose custom hooks in Drupal 8.

   After attending this session attendees will be able to:

Create their custom events in Drupal 8
Subscribe to the events from core and other modules and to their custom events too.
