Title: DrupalCon Dublin 2016: How do I Typed Data in Drupal 8
Publication date: 2016-09-27
Playlist: DrupalCon Dublin 2016
Description: 
	I was excited by the improvements and shininess in Drupal 8, but then I found the enigmatic Typed Data API lurking beneath the surface of high-level functionality including the Field and Entity APIs. The Typed Data Manager remains one of the more elusive and esoteric services in Drupal 8, and stands on its own as powerful tool to model complex data types without the storage concern of the Entity system.

Developers can leverage the Typed Data API in Drupal 8 components such as Serialization and Web Services.

In this session I will share how I leverage Typed Data covering the following topics:

What was the equivalent in Drupal 6 and 7?
What is a data type and data definition?
What are the possible uses, advantages and disadvantages of Typed Data?
How do I unit test the Typed Data Manager monster?
The session is designed for experienced developers who are interested in data modeling and integrating with external services. Some familiarity with the Drupal 8 Plugin, Form, PHPUnit or Render API is assumed.
