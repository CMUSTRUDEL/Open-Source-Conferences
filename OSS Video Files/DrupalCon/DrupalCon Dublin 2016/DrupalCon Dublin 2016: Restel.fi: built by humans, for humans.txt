Title: DrupalCon Dublin 2016: Restel.fi: built by humans, for humans
Publication date: 2016-09-27
Playlist: DrupalCon Dublin 2016
Description: 
	In the fall of 2015, Restel decided to improve its web presence. The company, Finland’s largest hospitality organization, runs a large portfolio of hotels and restaurants, including internationally-known brands such as Burger King and Holiday Inn. The primary requirements were to centralize most of Restel’s online presence to restel.fi, while at the same time redesigning it from a corporate site to a user-friendly outward-facing portal.

The project was started on Drupal 8, less than two months after it had been released. This presented us with exciting and useful new features, changes in the way we build sites because of tools like Twig, Composer, and CMI, and the occasional challenging core bug hunt.

This is a showcase covering the six-month process of building a new site that communicates with several other systems, some maintained by us, and some by third parties.

We’ll explain how sickness impacted the schedule, and how using an agile approach helped us take this hit. The Product Owner will share her experience of growing into a new role, and how Scrum smoothly facilitated the evolving requirements.

We’re looking forward to sharing our experience with those interested in taking a look in our kitchen to see what’s involved when working on more complex projects.

	00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:15,599
good morning so um let's get started

00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:19,039
welcome to our presentation our

00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:22,050
presentation is about how our team

00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:24,500
redesigned the old crystal that fi from

00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:28,050
a corporate website to a user-friendly

00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:29,400
outward facing portal but the most

00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:31,679
important thing is that this

00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:35,850
presentation that we're now having isn't

00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:41,399
actually technical it's more of a story

00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:43,520
of how the project happen but the story

00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:48,120
is more from the human point of view

00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:55,170
because this project was made by humans

00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:59,449
for humans alright so that's me my name

00:00:55,170 --> 00:01:05,970
is Jana the island and i am from finland

00:00:59,449 --> 00:01:09,659
mmm feelin um in Finland we have these

00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:12,000
all these crazy culture things that you

00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:15,270
guys might want to know about for

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:19,170
example awkward silence is more of a way

00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:21,180
of life than just an awkward silence we

00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:23,610
are taught at an early age that if you

00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:26,040
don't have anything important to say you

00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:28,590
don't say anything at all so it just

00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:32,040
keep it silent and it's better chance

00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:34,380
then that's just talk now the funny

00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:36,630
thing is that when a baby is born in

00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:40,439
Finland government gives them a box

00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:43,409
cardboard box food tools so they can get

00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:46,380
started in life and actually Finn's

00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:48,930
babies sleep in the cardboard boxes for

00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:51,329
the first months of their life and when

00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:54,000
I was born I actually slept for eight

00:01:51,329 --> 00:01:58,950
months in a cardboard box that's how my

00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:01,710
life got started there are also other

00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:06,119
funny things or quirky things about the

00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:07,950
Finns the picture on top is actually

00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:11,090
taking from Helsinki this was in the

00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:13,010
newspaper in Finland the Finns love

00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:15,349
their personal

00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:18,560
face that's why we're so far apart here

00:02:15,349 --> 00:02:23,450
I don't want part 2 near me but that

00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:26,239
does not apply when we go to sauna take

00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:28,400
off our clothes and just hanger skin to

00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:34,250
skin it doesn't matter that's the

00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:37,129
exception and we're given set of rules

00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:40,549
to live by that you have to know and

00:02:37,129 --> 00:02:43,849
obey if you are a thin and number one

00:02:40,549 --> 00:02:48,620
rule if you want to be a true and proper

00:02:43,849 --> 00:02:52,870
Finn is that you must never ever brag

00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:56,629
about what you do so me standing here

00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:59,840
just talking about this project would be

00:02:56,629 --> 00:03:02,480
bragging in a finished book so my

00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:07,310
passport will not probably work when I

00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:09,889
try to go home tomorrow but what do I

00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:14,180
actually do besides come from Finland I

00:03:09,889 --> 00:03:17,060
am a holistic agile coach a scrum master

00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:23,269
and a goat new be working with Java and

00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:26,959
JavaScript I am also a very proud who's

00:03:23,269 --> 00:03:28,639
Tinian i work at houston inc we are

00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:32,599
specialized in agile software

00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:36,470
development we are helsinki finland

00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:40,760

00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:48,859
project in a lifetime about trouble and

00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:51,079
me I've been a triple user for a year

00:03:48,859 --> 00:03:55,790
and a half and this is actually my first

00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:59,150
time ever speaking in public and me

00:03:55,790 --> 00:04:01,940
standing here with part is like would be

00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:04,010
like Luke Skywalker standing here with

00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:10,609
jar jar binks that's the difference

00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:13,519
between us I'm Jagger you so nervous i'm

00:04:10,609 --> 00:04:16,370

finished I'm Dutch I work for the am

00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:25,750
strand branch druid and I've been part

00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:28,750
of the team as one of

00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:32,440
developers that together with you on a

00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:36,370
revamp the entire estelle AG ecosystem

00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:39,520
on the web and my side of the story

00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:41,680
today will be how things like remote

00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:45,310
working and an agile approach helped us

00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:47,620
from a developer's perspective as you

00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:50,320
know to compliment her experiences from

00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:53,590
the clients point of view I'm an

00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:55,600
engineer I'm a nerd I'm a coder name it

00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:58,450
what you wanted I know a couple of

00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:00,490
languages I like them the differences

00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:03,100
the similarities they teach me a lot I

00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:05,050
like solving problems with them I love

00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:09,430
things like automation testing Quality

00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:11,320
Assurance deployments it takes the pain

00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:13,150
away from a lot of things it makes it it

00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:15,970
makes it a lot easier to do larger

00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:19,180
things with a small team which is what

00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:21,240
we're all trying to do I speak in public

00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:23,890
on occasion as you might have noticed

00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:25,030
this is a photo from the last Drupal

00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:31,150
jamming villains which is our national

00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:38,290
drupalcamp basically and my clicker

00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:39,850
doesn't work see now it does and I've

00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:42,370
been with the Drupal community for a few

00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:44,050
years now I've done some conferences in

00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:45,520
the Netherlands except until a couple

00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:47,770
hundred people I've helped with Drupal

00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:50,740
cons I've seen a lot of different size

00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:51,880
of the community of business i'm the

00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:54,250
founder of the dutch drupal foundation

00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:56,140
when we after a while realized that

00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:57,760
having several thousands of euros go

00:05:56,140 --> 00:06:00,910
through private accounts might not be

00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:03,910
the best idea in the world and step by

00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:05,620
step we all learn will grow and as

00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:07,570
someone who came to Drupal for the code

00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:11,140
I pretty much stayed with the community

00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:13,240
just like the motto says I'm also a

00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:15,100
mentor at Drupal events that basically

00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:17,710
means that someone who's been around for

00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:20,169
a few years who's worked on issues helps

00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:23,470
new people on board to an open source

00:06:20,169 --> 00:06:25,000
project in our case mainly during the

00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:27,220
Friday coats prints at drupalcon so this

00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,960
friday again we've got a couple dozen

00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:31,050
people like this group I think this is

00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:34,180
from New Orleans early this year yeah

00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:35,530
they come together and next to the main

00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:37,630
Sprint's were hundreds of experience

00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:39,310
contributors work there is space for new

00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:40,360
people and we own board them and not

00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:42,070
because we're not going to teach some

00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:43,180
things like HTML and PHP because they

00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:45,310
already know that we're going to teach

00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:47,800
them how to get navigate through the

00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:50,110
process of contribution finding an issue

00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:52,000
working on it making a patch writing a

00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:53,500
patch reviewing other people's patches

00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,480
implementing other people's feedback and

00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:58,660
eventually getting to a working solution

00:06:55,480 --> 00:07:01,690
that will be included in Drupal core and

00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:03,370
it's an extremely rewarding job mentors

00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:05,050
at this drupalcon will walk around in a

00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:07,900
purple t-shirt with the conference logo

00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:09,670
at the front give them a big thank you

00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:12,370
to see them they're all volunteers if

00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:14,380
you are one of these new people come to

00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:15,850
the mentors prints on Friday and will

00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:18,940
help you work on your first triple core

00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:23,500
commits and the button doesn't work

00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:26,710
again I am also a druid we have offices

00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:28,990
in Finland and an Amsterdam really

00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:31,840
unfortunately Dublin is distich over

00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:34,570
there somewhere we were nervously

00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:36,550
looking for a solution last night when

00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:38,260
we realized that we reuse this fancy

00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:40,870
fancy picture from an older presentation

00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:43,270
and then couldn't point a marker on the

00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:45,010
map for this particular conference we've

00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:46,480
got offices we started in Helsinki a

00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:49,330
couple years ago and last year with me

00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:51,490
and amsterdam we've got a couple of

00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:53,350
full-time remote employees and we've got

00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:57,490
a lot of employees who work remotely

00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:59,050
part-time are on an irregular basis

00:07:57,490 --> 00:08:00,910
which is partly what this presentation

00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:05,230
is going to be about our point of view

00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:09,550
on that pedestal is in this case the

00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:11,710
client that Jana was with its Finland

00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:15,010
sludge operator of hotels restaurants

00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:17,320
they run entire chains on like one-off

00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:19,990
hotels they run I think that the ice

00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:22,300
skating arena in Helsinki that a wide

00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:24,310
variety of hospitality business and

00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:27,940
their web presence reflected that at the

00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:29,260
time and because of the growth and their

00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:31,690
changes in the business model it look

00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:34,180
let's consolidate these things let's

00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:36,790
let's let's modernize our web presence

00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:40,180
and with that I want to hand it off to

00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:42,820
Jana to yeah drag you down the rabbit

00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:45,850
hole yeah so um I was the product owner

00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:48,130
in this project although I'm no longer

00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:51,130
with wrestle but I'm here to still talk

00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:52,649
about the project so let's get down to

00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:56,680
business

00:08:52,649 --> 00:09:01,960
a long time ago in a galaxy far far away

00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:06,100
at resto there was a war of the worlds

00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:08,620
going on when I talk about war of the

00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:11,680
worlds they were actually worlds that

00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:14,860
we're fighting some point a history at

00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:18,160
rest'll it was decided that having brand

00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:20,080
websites just wasn't enough but they

00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:22,720
wanted to make it easier for the

00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:24,580
customer not to have hop from another

00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,920
side to another side to look for

00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:30,310
information they wanted to build these

00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:33,100
brand distribution brands so they

00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:36,580
created actual new brands made a website

00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:40,029
and then put in a collected content from

00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:43,390
different brands and somebody get this

00:09:40,029 --> 00:09:45,430
genius idea to name them after world so

00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:47,649
there were a hotel world the way you

00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:50,800
could book a hotel nights but nothing

00:09:47,649 --> 00:09:53,380
else then they were event world where

00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:56,440
you could look for events but nothing

00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:58,390
else a restaurant world where you could

00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:01,420
look for a place to go eat but nothing

00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:03,580
else and they were also Christmas party

00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:05,800
world a couple of other worlds so the

00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:10,360
world just the universe keep on

00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:13,270
expanding and at some point it was the

00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:16,990
idea was good but it started to turn on

00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:18,630
itself the worlds were very siloed they

00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:23,170
didn't communicate there weren't

00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:25,150
integrations so it actually was the sort

00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:28,570
of war because they were ripping off

00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:33,820
resources from each other there were

00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:36,730
also the content chaos that came with

00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:39,310
different worlds because you cannot fit

00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:41,709
a whole brand website into a portal you

00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:44,230
have to take some of the information and

00:10:41,709 --> 00:10:46,779
leave something behind so there were

00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:49,180
bits and pieces of information sprinkled

00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:52,240
around these worlds and of course that

00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:54,430
is really confusing to the customers you

00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:56,829
get some of the information but not all

00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:58,690
so now you have to go to the world to

00:10:56,829 --> 00:11:01,600
the brand website and to the other

00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:05,140
worlds and suddenly you're really

00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,830
confused and it was really expensive to

00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:08,290
maintain

00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:11,170
all these worlds of course so it was

00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:14,830
decided that the end of the world's must

00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:17,290
come the big bang and it was decided

00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:19,750
that we would fusion the world's into

00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:22,780
the new rest'll that fi so we had to

00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:27,520
take all of the worlds and smash them

00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:31,210
together into one portal and the end

00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:33,610
goal was to have control content easy to

00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:36,970
get information and of course by because

00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:39,460
of that and the feeling of safety when

00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:41,350
you buy from an online store the number

00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:44,320
one thing that you have to make sure is

00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:47,080
that your customers feel safe when there

00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:50,260
is no human contact that the

00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:52,240
transactions have to feel safe and with

00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:58,570
finished people that is actually even

00:11:52,240 --> 00:12:00,610
more important well I was a new product

00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:04,240
owner when I took on this project and

00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:05,950
for my point of view when they like hand

00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:09,270
it over to me this is what you have to

00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:12,670
do it felt like entering a battlefield

00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:15,850
like looking at a battlefield well does

00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:20,770
arrows going on and worlds are fighting

00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:24,070
and what I just like to do when I go get

00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:26,800
into this situation is that I define my

00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:29,830
strategy so I took a look at it what it

00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:33,220
was what I had to do how do I get there

00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:36,250
there was a lot of roubles because of

00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:39,880
the world's so there was baggage from

00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:42,070
the previous projects but just don't

00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:45,040
mind the baggage don't my troubles just

00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:47,380
go ahead move forward and the most

00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:50,380
important thing is that if you're a new

00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:53,770
product owner or new doing big projects

00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:56,560
or i would say anything just be brave

00:12:53,770 --> 00:13:00,000
and take on the challenge even though it

00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:00,000
is really scary

00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:12,280
well so great now we are looking at a

00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:14,960
battlefield which is the projects for me

00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:18,080
but it isn't enough that there is

00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:20,870
fighting going on or arrows flying there

00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:24,790
are always surprises when entering a

00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:27,350
battle or an adventure and for me the

00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:30,980
real surprise was that there was this

00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:33,800
big green monster the Gojira meaning

00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:36,350
that I had the fear of doing this big

00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:38,630
great project for the first time ever

00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:41,120
and I think it is really important that

00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:44,690
you can say out loud the feelings that

00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:47,480
come with starting new fundamental tasks

00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:50,180
or starting a big project I feel scared

00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:54,010
but you just have to push through the

00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:57,080
fear and be willing to cage the monster

00:13:54,010 --> 00:14:02,510
you have to catch the fear in order to

00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:06,260
get things done well you cannot catch a

00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:08,480
monster by yourself Kenya nobody can you

00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:11,840
need a kick-ass sidekick like Batman has

00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:15,050
Robin right so at this point of the

00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:16,880
project I rest'll we decided that we

00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:19,490
need a partner who could do this

00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:21,140
smashing of the world together and we

00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:25,010
started looking at different software

00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:26,990
companies and we went through multiple

00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:30,230
good ones there weren't better or

00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:32,660
somewhere better or worse they were just

00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:36,440
it was about when we sit down with the

00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:38,480
Druids it was the first time ever and it

00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:41,630
just felt right we they had the right

00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:44,780
attitude the whites were I they knew

00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:47,000
about Triple A which was our one of the

00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:50,270
specs that the company had to feel that

00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:52,850
we wanted to work with them and really

00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:56,480
important was that we wanted to work at

00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:58,940
rest always scrum and move our thinking

00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:03,620
into a more agile way so the Druids

00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:08,210
offered a training for the whole

00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:12,940
corporation so the sidekicks we're

00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:12,940
choosing the Druids yay

00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:26,840
so going through a project or at the

00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:30,110
starting point of the project to me it

00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:33,340
feels like when you go rafting a river

00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:36,740
you are in the beginning of the river

00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:39,110
looking at it let's say an Amazon River

00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:40,790
a big scary river that you have to go

00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:43,190
through like you have to go through the

00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:45,440
project you have to get on that raft

00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:50,180
with your teammates and paddle through

00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:51,920
the whole hallway and the most important

00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:54,020
thing actually I have to say this

00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:56,720
painting that is behind it's pity that

00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:59,540
you cannot see but there was a laser

00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:02,330
pointer somewhere but here is bonfire

00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:05,660
and there are yeah I figures sitting

00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:08,090
next to the fire and I would actually

00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:10,190
say that this would have been a picture

00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:13,010
when we started working there was the

00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:15,560
bonfire there were the Druids with me on

00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:18,140
the bonfire I was sitting there and

00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:20,330
almost crying and they were patting my

00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:25,370
head it's going to be okay we're going

00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:28,010
to make it when I going to die and i

00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:31,190
believe them and then we started the

00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:33,980
journey and the timeline for this

00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:37,190
project was really tight it was doable

00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:41,390
but it was still really really tight so

00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:43,640
they were removed for any errors and we

00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:46,400
have to know where we were going there

00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:48,650
was also the thing that wrestle had used

00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:51,740
to be working with waterfall method I

00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:53,570
think most of you know what it is and

00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:56,150
there were different departments and

00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:58,430
different sort of waterfalls so we have

00:16:56,150 --> 00:17:02,270
to just paddle around those waterfalls

00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:05,720
or to try to sneak in scrum to those

00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:08,180
departments and the number one thing is

00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:11,390
that you have to trust your partner if

00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:13,430
you don't form the trust with your with

00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:18,920
your partner you just you cannot make it

00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:21,590
through well haha how do we get through

00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:24,050
this I was a goat at this moment that

00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:27,980
that that's like me in that specific

00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:31,710
moment how do we get through it well

00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:37,169
this is the TV shop moment the solution

00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:40,380
scrum fit so as I said before this was

00:17:37,169 --> 00:17:45,899
the first time that we started working

00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:49,950
with scrum and thinking agile and it

00:17:45,899 --> 00:17:53,570
wasn't easy at first I have you guys

00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:58,649
ever taking a break from working out

00:17:53,570 --> 00:18:01,890
yeah all right I did during the summer I

00:17:58,649 --> 00:18:05,039
didn't go to the gym or running and then

00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:06,809
I went back to the gym in the fall and I

00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:08,610
went to the dreadmill and started

00:18:06,809 --> 00:18:10,559
running like yeah I'm going to get fit

00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:14,190
and then I thought I was going to die

00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:19,679
and i looked at the clock and I had been

00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:22,740
running for 15 seconds so that is

00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:26,610
basically how it felt when I started

00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:29,700
working with scrum but how do you get

00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:33,270
through that first burn and how do you

00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:36,720
get hit again oh you just have to repeat

00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:39,990
it over and over again until you get

00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:43,679
more fit and can long run more long

00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:46,919
distances and it starts to feel natural

00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:48,750
you know it you don't even feel that

00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:51,960
you're running anymore and that's what

00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:55,669
we did with the Druids we just stick to

00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:58,649
this really strict form of scrum and

00:18:55,669 --> 00:19:01,080
repeated it although it was it was pain

00:18:58,649 --> 00:19:03,450
in the ass Bart drove me crazy so many

00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:06,510
times but I love you for it part but

00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:09,179
still it was hard in the beginning but

00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:11,250
after why we didn't even notice that we

00:19:09,179 --> 00:19:14,520
were working with scrum and that's the

00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:17,250
magic moment when you can have cake have

00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:20,100
cheat days it is the same when you're

00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:22,710
working out and you're working with

00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:24,390
scrum when it feels natural when you're

00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:28,350
like in the secure place with your

00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:30,929
exercise or eating right you can have

00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:35,279
cheat days you can start modifying the

00:19:30,929 --> 00:19:37,320
scrum process to your teams needs just

00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:39,240
like you can eat cake when you're

00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:42,480
getting fit and you're in the secure

00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:44,230
place at the steady place after about

00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:48,190
nine weeks of working out

00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:50,169
and you have to reward yourself I just I

00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:52,960
want to remind people when they start

00:19:50,169 --> 00:19:54,850
working working with new project

00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:57,820
framework that when you get to this

00:19:54,850 --> 00:19:59,830
point that you you got it you have to

00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:05,740
reward yourself and say yeah good job

00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:10,840
have some cake and then they were the

00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:13,630
last price at a critical point of this

00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:17,230
project it was make-it-or-break-it

00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:20,620
moment we got the news that one of our

00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:23,910
teammates got really really ill like ill

00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:27,070
as in we didn't know that would he make

00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:30,580
make it to the rest of the project or

00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:33,520
not at all and the first thing think

00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:38,679
that I thought when I got the news was

00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:41,919
oh my god how is doing can I do anything

00:20:38,679 --> 00:20:44,860
for him and now you might wonder like

00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:47,559
why she say that that's obvious do you

00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:51,790
think about the person first right well

00:20:47,559 --> 00:20:53,620
actually that's when it hit me if this

00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:56,530
would have happened to me a year and a

00:20:53,620 --> 00:21:00,010
half ago before I had changed my

00:20:56,530 --> 00:21:02,890
thinking to a more agile way and working

00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:04,900
with scrum I would have thought a whole

00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:09,790
bunch of different things I would have

00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:13,540
thought about the project how what will

00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:17,160
happen to this expensive project I would

00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:20,140
have thought about money but my focus on

00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:22,450
surviving I would have thought about my

00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:24,040
team member of course but it would be

00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:28,360
the first thing that I would stop

00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:32,440
because I would have been scared what

00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:35,260
will happen to the to the project but I

00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:37,510
wasn't a friend anymore and that is

00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:42,480
actually the moment of enlightenment

00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:45,870
that I had I was no longer afraid

00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:49,510
everything was under control I had

00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:52,750
adapted a new way of thinking how change

00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:55,929
should be taken if changes have been

00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:57,130
it's natural it's okay just go with the

00:21:55,929 --> 00:22:00,610
flow

00:21:57,130 --> 00:22:02,850
isn't anything special and that is like

00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:07,300
that that was the moment when I realized

00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:10,840
what this all was about it wasn't about

00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:13,060
a project framework anybody can learn a

00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:15,940
project framework and do things in a

00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:19,510
certain way but what happens inside your

00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:23,650
head that is a whole different story you

00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:25,270
can get yourself enlighten or just keep

00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:27,580
on working without changing your

00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:33,010
thinking but you can benefit so much

00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:35,530
from thinking differently and that is

00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:38,610
actually how you do it we talked about

00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:42,610
battles where you need to be not afraid

00:22:38,610 --> 00:22:44,800
and we talked about the monsters how it

00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:47,350
was a surprise that there was fear and

00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:50,470
how things changed and when you're not

00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:54,340
low longer afraid you can catch the

00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:57,580
monster you can win battles and you can

00:22:54,340 --> 00:23:01,540
get enlightened and that was basically

00:22:57,580 --> 00:23:09,430
the moment that was a really significant

00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:13,930
for me personally during this project it

00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:18,940
works so does anybody recognize this no

00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:20,620
nobody no nobody knows what this is this

00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:25,600
is the druid office some days of the

00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:27,460
week this is like you you get in you

00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:29,080
look around you look what the is

00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:32,770
everybody's everybody's still in bed no

00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:35,080
no no no no someone you know is maybe

00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:38,910
sick there's a whole team working at the

00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:41,380
University on-site people are working

00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:42,640
from home temporarily because they have

00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:46,450
to take care of their children in the

00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:48,850
meantime we've learned especially

00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:51,280
through this project because I was there

00:23:48,850 --> 00:23:52,570
the first non fin like being at the

00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:55,810
office but then the office in the other

00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:57,220
country that what remote working and

00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:59,980
what a distributed team actually means

00:23:57,220 --> 00:24:02,020
for us and that you don't have to have

00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:05,910
an office that is a buzzing with people

00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:05,910
to be able to work together really well

00:24:07,889 --> 00:24:14,259
so what it means to distribute is really

00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:16,179
just to spread out you can if you throw

00:24:14,259 --> 00:24:19,539
candy in the air you distribute it if

00:24:16,179 --> 00:24:21,309
you take a map you put a few pins on it

00:24:19,539 --> 00:24:23,950
like that's where people work it's

00:24:21,309 --> 00:24:25,480
distributed doesn't really mean a way of

00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:28,419
working necessarily be is it you're not

00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:30,880
together but it does mean that you have

00:24:28,419 --> 00:24:32,950
to have a different way of working than

00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:35,169
humanity's classically being used to

00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:36,909
like we all show up at the office at 8

00:24:35,169 --> 00:24:39,159
30 or nine in the morning we all leave

00:24:36,909 --> 00:24:41,710
at five real have we have lunch together

00:24:39,159 --> 00:24:43,389
because between those moments we all

00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:46,120
have to be at the same place at the same

00:24:43,389 --> 00:24:48,730
time and we had to reinvent ourselves a

00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:51,669
little bit we already employed some of

00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:54,970
these practices we did more it became

00:24:51,669 --> 00:24:57,519
more intense for us and that's that's

00:24:54,970 --> 00:25:00,759
basically how we learned as a

00:24:57,519 --> 00:25:02,590
development team during this project you

00:25:00,759 --> 00:25:04,929
can make any remote or distribute it for

00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:07,539
many different reasons from people

00:25:04,929 --> 00:25:09,429
actually living somewhere we've got you

00:25:07,539 --> 00:25:11,769
know the three full-time remote

00:25:09,429 --> 00:25:14,529
employees one of whom actually has a

00:25:11,769 --> 00:25:16,960
fancy-pants office share with 80 other

00:25:14,529 --> 00:25:19,149
developers other companies people can be

00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:22,450
working from home because it is a VAM a

00:25:19,149 --> 00:25:24,759
that people can be sick sick children's

00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:26,470
sake partners have to run around maybe

00:25:24,759 --> 00:25:28,480
drive their parents around in between

00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:29,649
work they could have other appointments

00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:31,240
like I'm not going to go to office on

00:25:29,649 --> 00:25:33,039
that side of town I have to be there an

00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:35,230
hour afterwards this is the ways of my

00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:36,340
time up until the point where someone's

00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:38,289
like I'm just going to sit at home and

00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:39,490
work from there today so I can just do

00:25:38,289 --> 00:25:41,230
groceries and laundry because I've been

00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:43,809
forgetting that for the longest time and

00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:47,169
that is fine it doesn't really matter

00:25:43,809 --> 00:25:48,879
why someone works remotely it is it's me

00:25:47,169 --> 00:25:51,250
it's become almost entirely irrelevant

00:25:48,879 --> 00:25:52,720
for us because the point is are you

00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:55,210
connected are you available where you

00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:57,460
have to we've we've gotten to this point

00:25:55,210 --> 00:25:59,919
where we've got a way of communicating

00:25:57,460 --> 00:26:01,509
or oh I'll be I'll be can I be out of

00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:03,759
the office for a few hours there and

00:26:01,509 --> 00:26:04,929
then because there's an that what needs

00:26:03,759 --> 00:26:07,090
to be done would it be missing anything

00:26:04,929 --> 00:26:09,190
might anyone need me during that time

00:26:07,090 --> 00:26:10,509
and that's just like a very quick bit of

00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:14,259
communication between the team members

00:26:10,509 --> 00:26:15,580
to to align to synchronize and then

00:26:14,259 --> 00:26:19,000
people call that separate ways so our

00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:20,559
work days are not entirely lined up but

00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,600
we do try to sort

00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:24,730
align ourselves with each other to make

00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:27,700
sure that when we do work with we don't

00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:29,230
walk each other accidentally and we're

00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:33,220
available to help each other out to

00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:35,710
mentor each other and because we do that

00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:39,879
we have these freedoms as development

00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:41,610
teams so these are these are a couple of

00:26:39,879 --> 00:26:44,740
very very old pretty Dutch windmills

00:26:41,610 --> 00:26:47,049
this is where I came in I was I was the

00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:48,850
weird foreigner who didn't speak Finnish

00:26:47,049 --> 00:26:52,919
even when things were written down on

00:26:48,850 --> 00:26:55,929
paper like that's not documentation

00:26:52,919 --> 00:26:58,029
quite midnight in India there might be a

00:26:55,929 --> 00:27:00,580
nursery rhyme for all I know but that's

00:26:58,029 --> 00:27:02,799
finished I have no idea what it is so

00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:03,940
things had to change and everybody was

00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:05,409
fine with that but we're trying to

00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:07,240
figure out how we were supposed to do

00:27:05,409 --> 00:27:08,590
this you know we're becoming more

00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:12,159
international we becoming more

00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:14,049
distributed and all right let's tackle

00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:15,549
this like what do we need and we're

00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:17,259
taking this one step at a time look if

00:27:15,549 --> 00:27:19,029
we need something right now and it

00:27:17,259 --> 00:27:21,340
doesn't exist on paper at all let's

00:27:19,029 --> 00:27:23,100
start creating it if it exists in

00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:26,259
Finnish let's start translating it and

00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:28,840
from that moment on based on a needs

00:27:26,259 --> 00:27:32,799
basis the company slowly gradually

00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:35,399
started modernizing a little bit to the

00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:41,019
point where we have fancy wind turbines

00:27:35,399 --> 00:27:44,519
modern green highly efficient this is a

00:27:41,019 --> 00:27:46,899
nice picture also from our Dutch water

00:27:44,519 --> 00:27:50,559
management systems in case the North Sea

00:27:46,899 --> 00:27:51,759
tries to drown is again we were speaking

00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:52,809
about waterfalls and rivers and

00:27:51,759 --> 00:27:56,019
everything like that that's how we

00:27:52,809 --> 00:27:57,309
that's how we do it it's public domain

00:27:56,019 --> 00:27:59,919
so you can copy it for your countries if

00:27:57,309 --> 00:28:01,419
you want to but the main thing we

00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:03,309
learned is that you have to modernize

00:28:01,419 --> 00:28:06,700
and essentially that means like the

00:28:03,309 --> 00:28:09,820
things that you do they usually have to

00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:11,110
be electronic as I mentioned you have to

00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:12,669
be connected you have to be available it

00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:14,889
doesn't really matter where if you want

00:28:12,669 --> 00:28:17,169
to be on a sunny beach with a cocktail

00:28:14,889 --> 00:28:18,759
in your hand while working if you have a

00:28:17,169 --> 00:28:20,139
kick-ass Wi-Fi connection and a wired

00:28:18,759 --> 00:28:22,299
connection back in the office a little

00:28:20,139 --> 00:28:23,860
further in town as a backup you're fine

00:28:22,299 --> 00:28:25,840
you can do your job if you have phone

00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:28,690
reception you can be reached you can

00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:30,820
upload to git repositories you're

00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:32,970
available for people to help if you have

00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:34,310
a quiet spot you can do conference calls

00:28:32,970 --> 00:28:36,350
so it doesn't

00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:38,090
where you are as long as things are

00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:39,820
electronic documentation has to be

00:28:38,090 --> 00:28:46,460
available electronically discussions

00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:48,590
electronically log things and it works

00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:50,450
fine without that in many cases if you

00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:51,650
don't if you're not distributed if

00:28:50,450 --> 00:28:53,870
you're at the same office you work to

00:28:51,650 --> 00:28:55,880
the other person's desk hey I'm standing

00:28:53,870 --> 00:28:57,020
this one thing nobody else in the

00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:58,280
company is going to see that maybe three

00:28:57,020 --> 00:29:01,160
other co-workers were at the same time

00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:03,500
struggling with the same problem so it

00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:06,560
creates transparency as well it it

00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:08,150
benefits more than just you and that one

00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:11,150
person you're talking to and working

00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:13,460
with at that particular time and it's

00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:16,160
been a great move it's been a struggle

00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:17,420
for us internally as well because it's

00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:19,280
quite demanding people have to change

00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:22,280
workflows you start do people start

00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:25,370
doing it the old way I can't do anything

00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:27,470
with that how do I a giant it and it

00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:29,780
works through through openness and

00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:32,600
collaboration and mentoring each other

00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:35,570
we've achieved a state where this has

00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:39,160
become a second nature to us and a more

00:29:35,570 --> 00:29:39,160
modern nature than we had a year ago

00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:46,550
another thing is that this was our

00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:48,830
second big Drupal 8 project and it was

00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:50,240
blah we started working on it less than

00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:52,100
two months after drew blade has come out

00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:54,560
when November 19 last year we started

00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:56,930
january six was a kickoff meeting I was

00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:59,930
I think we started doing the first cut

00:29:56,930 --> 00:30:01,490
the week after slowly um so it was it

00:29:59,930 --> 00:30:03,680
was really new and I'm a core

00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:06,310
contributor and then you've got you

00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:08,660
haven't even seen all of it by by far

00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:11,990
and then there were so many things that

00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:14,090
were Drupal 8 but you only see them when

00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:16,820
you you use them in a client project we

00:30:14,090 --> 00:30:18,170
start deploying larger things frizzes

00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:19,850
composer was really new to us we had

00:30:18,170 --> 00:30:21,170
multilingual issues at some point some

00:30:19,850 --> 00:30:23,330
bugs some things like oh how are we

00:30:21,170 --> 00:30:25,600
going to have to adapt our workflow like

00:30:23,330 --> 00:30:27,470
we used to do it like this in Drupal 7

00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:30,920
so that was that was really challenging

00:30:27,470 --> 00:30:34,340
for us in a really fun way but you also

00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:36,650
inevitably run into bugs like I said

00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:38,300
Drupal 8 still is Brett me when at the

00:30:36,650 --> 00:30:40,640
time was just like right off the show

00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:42,920
there wasn't even any dust on it I mean

00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:44,150
but under the surface there are always a

00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:45,680
few things wrong here and there that's

00:30:44,150 --> 00:30:46,300
fine where people work things go wrong

00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:50,620
we can

00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:52,750
we're not perfect so what do we do we

00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:55,080
need to fix them but we don't want to

00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:59,740
have the other team fix it as well so

00:30:55,080 --> 00:31:02,500
you collaborate you you contribute to

00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:03,610
fix back to the project not only so the

00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:04,930
rest of the team can use it without

00:31:03,610 --> 00:31:06,400
having to bother them because you know

00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:08,020
by the next by the time they pull in the

00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:09,580
next group will update they'll have them

00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:14,200
they won't even know there was a problem

00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:15,910
to begin with but you contribute and we

00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:18,970
realized that like all these little

00:31:15,910 --> 00:31:20,560
things that we encounter these small

00:31:18,970 --> 00:31:22,180
problems like a the little bug here as

00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:23,440
an oddity there or tiny missing check

00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:25,300
box here that won't you know a little

00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:27,880
toggle that would help us do what we

00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:30,310
need and like but but how does it make

00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:32,680
Drupal better it's actually part of a

00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:35,200
marketing a bit our company policy like

00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:37,840
you know we use this project we want to

00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:40,750
get back to it but it also shows what we

00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:44,080
can do it sometimes feels that you're

00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:46,290
walking into a wall well the people in

00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:48,850
Berlin sure felt like that a while ago

00:31:46,290 --> 00:31:50,710
and this is an old African saying I

00:31:48,850 --> 00:31:52,600
really like the German version of it

00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:55,750
though because of that wall feeling and

00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:58,240
it goes via decline alloy 2 in violent

00:31:55,750 --> 00:32:00,340
collider norton villa clannad ingatan

00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:02,200
couldn't disguise a shavette fanden when

00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:04,210
many small people in many small places

00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:06,700
do a lot of small things that can alter

00:32:04,210 --> 00:32:09,730
the face of the world you can do a few

00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:12,250
small things and it has an impact Drupal

00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:14,740
is installed on runs millions of

00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:17,620
websites it's what I said with a

00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:21,490
mentoring earlier the idea is that you

00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:23,830
that you or you contribute a small fix a

00:32:21,490 --> 00:32:26,230
small improvement which will then be

00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:28,780
used by millions of websites so how

00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:32,620
small is it really such as well change

00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:34,870
how like put a chisel on a wall hammer

00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:38,940
on it ones whatever thousand people do

00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:41,290
that walls gone before you know it and

00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:43,810
you have to collaborate you can't do it

00:32:41,290 --> 00:32:45,850
on your own we have an internal peer

00:32:43,810 --> 00:32:49,270
review process with the Druids so code

00:32:45,850 --> 00:32:51,190
is almost never committed or deployed

00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:53,110
without at least two druids looking at

00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:55,030
it sometimes even more depending on the

00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:56,500
type of problem and it's a very common

00:32:55,030 --> 00:32:59,270
process in open source software you have

00:32:56,500 --> 00:33:00,680
you have peer reviews in Drupal

00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:02,810
there is a heart requirement that at

00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:04,400
least three people look at the code

00:33:02,810 --> 00:33:05,930
before it is committed the original

00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:07,340
author at least one reviewer and then

00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:09,800
there's a core commuter doing a final

00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:12,680
global review and then that person

00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:14,000
commits it but they can be at NAPA this

00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:16,820
is this touches such fundamental

00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,350
subsystem i want at least four people to

00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:19,490
review this or I want those specific

00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:23,360
people to review it because they were

00:33:19,490 --> 00:33:25,550
the original architects so the benefit

00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:28,280
of this is that if we want to contribute

00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:32,360
problems or solutions to problems back

00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:33,950
to Drupal it's not just a district way

00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:35,750
of distributing it back to ourselves

00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:37,850
into the rest of the world but we also

00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:39,950
benefit from this highly intense

00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:41,690
collaboration process that results in a

00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:43,940
high-quality fix because if we do it

00:33:41,690 --> 00:33:44,930
ourselves we might overlook something we

00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:47,630
might not know that it is the right

00:33:44,930 --> 00:33:49,730
solution we might think it is well

00:33:47,630 --> 00:33:52,730
actually it has some side effect that

00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:55,640
the test didn't catch so when we do it

00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:58,100
in public yes we open ourselves up to

00:33:55,640 --> 00:34:02,330
scrutiny which is exactly what we want

00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:03,320
we want someone to say nice try to do it

00:34:02,330 --> 00:34:04,940
slightly differently because otherwise

00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:07,100
it's going to break that way okay cool

00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:09,740
someone has just prevented us from

00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:11,810
falling in that pit and potentially

00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:15,200
millions of other Drupal sites to follow

00:34:11,810 --> 00:34:21,710
you to get the same fate you know what

00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:26,270
that all right guns lots of them yeah in

00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:30,260
every project there is that one amazing

00:34:26,270 --> 00:34:33,409
at least one amazing team night out and

00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:37,100
left me we had a discussion with the

00:34:33,409 --> 00:34:40,130
ribs that maybe we should take that time

00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:42,440
outside the project and go and just have

00:34:40,130 --> 00:34:44,570
some fun together because we had fun

00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:46,940
working together about still do

00:34:44,570 --> 00:34:49,940
something outside the project and

00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:52,130
workplace so the Druids because I was

00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:54,560
too client asked me what do I wanted to

00:34:52,130 --> 00:34:56,630
do and I team that out and it's a fancy

00:34:54,560 --> 00:35:01,460
lady I said I want to go and shoot guns

00:34:56,630 --> 00:35:04,070
and eat get food so we went to Helsinki

00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:07,370
shooting club and they indulged me with

00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:09,980
buying this amazing gun buffet thingy

00:35:07,370 --> 00:35:11,240
that we went shooting with that off

00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:12,890
you're seeing this thank you for the

00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:16,130
gold package yeah

00:35:12,890 --> 00:35:20,420
at all and this is from the place that

00:35:16,130 --> 00:35:23,900
we went to eat and I have to say that if

00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:26,510
it's rare to have such a good time with

00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:28,460
the people that you are working with or

00:35:26,510 --> 00:35:32,089
I've had worse night with my friends

00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:33,740
that I have this to Maya it was really

00:35:32,089 --> 00:35:35,359
good because it included people that

00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:37,010
were only sideways involved in the

00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:39,440
project as well both from your

00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:41,390
assignment from our side the the core

00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:43,910
team the people who work with daily was

00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:46,789
what five people yeah we went out with

00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:50,119
eight or nine you know some support

00:35:46,789 --> 00:35:51,920
stuff on her side on our side and you

00:35:50,119 --> 00:35:54,500
get to know like the whole group of

00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:56,059
people it explains like you get to know

00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:58,519
people at oh you know you're the person

00:35:56,059 --> 00:36:00,349
we've been emailing with now I get also

00:35:58,519 --> 00:36:03,319
what you request to her but like the way

00:36:00,349 --> 00:36:06,710
that people ask things it's even though

00:36:03,319 --> 00:36:09,799
we were a remote team for the largest

00:36:06,710 --> 00:36:13,010
part that was really good because you

00:36:09,799 --> 00:36:15,440
get to know people so much better you

00:36:13,010 --> 00:36:16,640
can anticipate how they respond you

00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:20,150
understand the response is so much

00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:21,410
better which i think is if you do work

00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:24,019
remotely this is one of the requirements

00:36:21,410 --> 00:36:25,519
yeah you discover chucking details of

00:36:24,019 --> 00:36:27,680
our you call like many daily conference

00:36:25,519 --> 00:36:29,240
calls do a lot of things but yeah the

00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:34,400
shocking details are usually left out of

00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:38,299
the office so on a a wonderful wonderful

00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:40,910
monday june twenty this year after 80 a

00:36:38,299 --> 00:36:43,910
long night at like two or three a.m. at

00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:45,470
night I went to the veranda of the house

00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:48,109
the friends house and I was staying at

00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:51,200
it much real not really to enjoy the

00:36:48,109 --> 00:36:55,369
sunshine but it was the day of our lunch

00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:57,470
so so I was there enjoying the Montreal

00:36:55,369 --> 00:37:00,589
sunshine until the rest of the team came

00:36:57,470 --> 00:37:02,630
online and I was thinking this is

00:37:00,589 --> 00:37:04,819
actually hilarious cuz right the hell is

00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:08,329
Jana yes your zoom in grocery shopping

00:37:04,819 --> 00:37:10,819
in Hong Kong at the time yeah did she

00:37:08,329 --> 00:37:12,859
mention the good food and like all right

00:37:10,819 --> 00:37:16,009
now right we know where she is has

00:37:12,859 --> 00:37:19,009
anyone seen you see where where is you

00:37:16,009 --> 00:37:22,609
see you see was up in northern Finland

00:37:19,009 --> 00:37:24,890
in his holiday cabin like all right

00:37:22,609 --> 00:37:25,940
what if that goes wrong well you see

00:37:24,890 --> 00:37:26,630
what's connected you see what's

00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:30,019
available

00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:31,940
not really a problem and someone might

00:37:30,019 --> 00:37:33,680
as well stare at a lovely beautiful lake

00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:35,660
and enjoy the but birds chirping right

00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:37,430
because if something goes wrong a bit of

00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:40,970
therapy in the background is usually

00:37:37,430 --> 00:37:43,819
helpful so because we'd learned to work

00:37:40,970 --> 00:37:45,559
together remotely as a distributed semi

00:37:43,819 --> 00:37:47,359
distributed team we learned to

00:37:45,559 --> 00:37:51,380
coordinate we learned to work together

00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:52,970
remotely we plant things in advance you

00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:56,150
you tap the right person the shoulder

00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:58,430
when you're done and the process goes

00:37:56,150 --> 00:38:01,700
really smoothly at that point you don't

00:37:58,430 --> 00:38:04,099
you don't need to be at a desk to do

00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:06,890
something that could be as risky as a

00:38:04,099 --> 00:38:08,569
lunch it's it's it's worked fine we knew

00:38:06,890 --> 00:38:09,980
what we were doing when things went

00:38:08,569 --> 00:38:12,230
wrong with things were unsure we know

00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:17,150
exactly moved to contact everybody was

00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:20,839
available and then that resulted in the

00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:23,990
launch of the new Tesla website that for

00:38:20,839 --> 00:38:25,730
them as an organization marked the start

00:38:23,990 --> 00:38:27,170
of a change in their business model they

00:38:25,730 --> 00:38:28,519
could they could do the things that they

00:38:27,170 --> 00:38:31,549
really wanted to do now that they had to

00:38:28,519 --> 00:38:32,960
do and we've seen a massive increase in

00:38:31,549 --> 00:38:34,700
people booking hotels and restaurants

00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:38,450
going out for weekend's away with

00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:42,109
partners because we launched a nice

00:38:38,450 --> 00:38:44,299
product together now that is really

00:38:42,109 --> 00:38:46,190
satisfactory even at six a.m. in the

00:38:44,299 --> 00:38:48,940
morning when your deployment has finally

00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:51,049
ended and you're like I can go to bed

00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:53,240
which is the most awkward thing the

00:38:51,049 --> 00:38:54,589
thing that you haven't come home from a

00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:55,910
bar you're going to bed when everybody

00:38:54,589 --> 00:38:59,359
else is getting into the cars to get to

00:38:55,910 --> 00:39:02,660
the office but it's a good feeling it's

00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:06,170
great we've loved working together with

00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:07,730
us though I think one of the nicest

00:39:06,170 --> 00:39:10,059
things is that when we've been really

00:39:07,730 --> 00:39:13,789
open to each other that we've admitted

00:39:10,059 --> 00:39:16,160
mistakes we've stop pointing fingers

00:39:13,789 --> 00:39:17,420
we've started looking at the problems

00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:20,869
like okay as things that need solving

00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:22,190
that we need to learn from we've learned

00:39:20,869 --> 00:39:24,859
what the other people learn like how

00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:27,259
this was for them we've changed our

00:39:24,859 --> 00:39:31,670
workflow is based on on how we've seen

00:39:27,259 --> 00:39:35,230
clients do things and it has made us a

00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:37,940
richer team it has made us and

00:39:35,230 --> 00:39:40,010
appreciate communication a lot more like

00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:41,990
clear communication

00:39:40,010 --> 00:39:45,050
area for each other we had a lot of

00:39:41,990 --> 00:39:49,150
sicknesses from a couple days to long

00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:51,730
term as described and we remain human

00:39:49,150 --> 00:39:56,630
we're not we're not distant we're just

00:39:51,730 --> 00:39:58,030
physically away from each other this is

00:39:56,630 --> 00:39:59,540
the end of their are a slide deck

00:39:58,030 --> 00:40:01,100
depending on you at see another

00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:03,260
presentation if you want to look us up

00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:11,170
these are our twitter handles you have

00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:11,170
any questions about our experiences yes

00:40:13,810 --> 00:40:20,270
which gun did I like the vest I like the

00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:22,970
biggest one but I could only shoot the

00:40:20,270 --> 00:40:24,860
smallest gun because the noise was so

00:40:22,970 --> 00:40:27,590
loud that I can handle the big one but I

00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:32,000
like the big one the most it was

00:40:27,590 --> 00:40:34,520
yesterday actually the smaller ones were

00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:36,350
quite nice yeah I was also really fun I

00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:38,660
mean the big the big ones quite nice but

00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:40,190
if you're down there with sweaty hands

00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:41,510
in its kind of if you haven't been to a

00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:42,920
shooting range like a decent shooting

00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:46,010
range it's not our door in the middle of

00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:47,420
nowhere tends to be underground and

00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:49,520
you're surrounded by a lot of concrete

00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:52,100
so it's kind of a bunker this particular

00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:54,950
one was sort of a bunker inside of a

00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:56,480
bunker inside of a bunkers I'm not sure

00:40:54,950 --> 00:41:00,890
what invasion they were still ephrata

00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:02,780
but safety there with his disease long

00:41:00,890 --> 00:41:05,540
gun and sweaty hands like I'm not

00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:07,010
training this stuff but the smaller ones

00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:11,840
tend to be a little bit more fun at that

00:41:07,010 --> 00:41:14,000
point yeah yeah and the food was

00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:16,160
delicious afterwards so you forget the

00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:18,350
noise the music was so it was

00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:26,570
surprisingly soft late at night yeah

00:41:18,350 --> 00:41:28,610
yeah yeah very good one we use flow dock

00:41:26,570 --> 00:41:32,030
as a team chat we recently migrated to

00:41:28,610 --> 00:41:35,600
slack we really miss the Florrick

00:41:32,030 --> 00:41:37,160
threading features we realized and it

00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:40,910
goes all the way to things like whatsapp

00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:43,460
SMS hangouts you hang us for conference

00:41:40,910 --> 00:41:45,440
calls even one on one calls oh we just

00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:46,760
like we pick up the phone like oh I

00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:49,070
need to talk to this person right now

00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:51,530
like be it's a difficult problem so

00:41:49,070 --> 00:41:53,100
having a richer medium to describe

00:41:51,530 --> 00:41:55,680
something that you're not even sure

00:41:53,100 --> 00:42:00,140
to ask pick up the damn phone and call

00:41:55,680 --> 00:42:04,650
that person roaming charges a Europe are

00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:05,760
increasingly friendly to people so it's

00:42:04,650 --> 00:42:07,620
very accessible to just pick up the

00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:09,960
phone and call someone here's someone's

00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:11,400
voice if someone sounds like they're

00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:13,980
having a time pick up the phone

00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:15,720
like I've been in I've worked in offices

00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:17,160
where like should I should I ask this

00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:18,990
person how they do I'm not entirely sure

00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:20,100
if you're on the chat you're like all

00:42:18,990 --> 00:42:22,500
right you could either be having a

00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:25,080
 terrible time and trying to

00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:27,330
throw yourself off a building or maybe

00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:29,850
not but i'll do i'll just try that call

00:42:27,330 --> 00:42:53,010
I'll just I'll just see how it's going

00:42:29,850 --> 00:42:55,440
with you yes have you ever driven a car

00:42:53,010 --> 00:42:57,300
in the Netherlands it's a smooth as

00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:59,760
driving a car in the Netherlands like

00:42:57,300 --> 00:43:03,590
residential areas it's quite nice until

00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:06,720
you realize its full speed bumps so um

00:43:03,590 --> 00:43:08,850
yes it was it was a fairly nice process

00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:11,310
but yeah it comes and goes the little

00:43:08,850 --> 00:43:13,290
steps sometimes it was worse in the

00:43:11,310 --> 00:43:15,270
beginning a worse in the sense that more

00:43:13,290 --> 00:43:18,810
important information was at the time

00:43:15,270 --> 00:43:21,750
still in finish it hardly ever happens

00:43:18,810 --> 00:43:24,240
anymore even general meetings that I'm

00:43:21,750 --> 00:43:27,150
not a part of necessarily are just by

00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:35,760
default done in English notes are done

00:43:27,150 --> 00:43:37,320
in English so it's it's yeah bumpy yes

00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:38,670
well you think it's she's kind of

00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:40,610
representative for their stuff inland so

00:43:38,670 --> 00:43:44,360
it's it's been it's that part has been

00:43:40,610 --> 00:43:47,750
hardly a problem at all i have to say

00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:47,750
get a question yeah

00:43:48,900 --> 00:44:04,140
I think this is movie for you because

00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:06,300
Finland has some interesting

00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:09,630
multilingual things culturally yeah we

00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:14,010
started out with the English Finnish and

00:44:09,630 --> 00:44:17,490
Swedish we decided if we have time we

00:44:14,010 --> 00:44:19,500
will put Swedish version also out I

00:44:17,490 --> 00:44:23,310
don't think that there were any problems

00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:26,880
and after I've left Bristol they have

00:44:23,310 --> 00:44:29,280
added Chinese and Russian also so we

00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:33,540
have quite a lot of language versions of

00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:36,180
the customer portal well Finland has as

00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:37,740
Swedish as a Second Language it's right

00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:39,930
next to Russia so a lot of people coming

00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:42,030
in from there there's a lot of travel to

00:44:39,930 --> 00:44:45,810
Asia because it's because it's more

00:44:42,030 --> 00:44:47,580
north it's it's very well connected so

00:44:45,810 --> 00:44:49,320
hence these requirements from a

00:44:47,580 --> 00:44:52,470
technical perspective drivel it was a

00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:54,500
bliss to work with the people who worked

00:44:52,470 --> 00:44:58,350
on the multilingual features did a

00:44:54,500 --> 00:45:01,620
massive job bringing it up unifying all

00:44:58,350 --> 00:45:02,970
these features across triple the

00:45:01,620 --> 00:45:05,520
problems we had technically speaking

00:45:02,970 --> 00:45:11,730
were mostly due to immaturity like a you

00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:14,100
a bug here and there and be I think

00:45:11,730 --> 00:45:15,750
multilingual we never really had any any

00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:18,420
big issues that really fundamentally

00:45:15,750 --> 00:45:22,130
badly designed multilingual support that

00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:22,130
blocked us from doing we need to

00:45:36,290 --> 00:45:42,960
it is the same website the content on

00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:44,340
the website is just translated so the

00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:46,530
system is identical and it depends on

00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:48,270
the language that is picked and this pic

00:45:46,530 --> 00:45:49,560
based on on several criteria is an

00:45:48,270 --> 00:45:54,300
actual language selector but it depends

00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:56,550
on URL prefixes browser preferences and

00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:57,860
basically language that I picked you get

00:45:56,550 --> 00:45:59,970
a certain version of the content and

00:45:57,860 --> 00:46:02,130
then the wrestle staff they have

00:45:59,970 --> 00:46:04,080
editorial staff they are responsible for

00:46:02,130 --> 00:46:06,840
the actual translations and they very

00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:08,070
purposefully also sometimes choose not

00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:09,900
to translate a certain section of

00:46:08,070 --> 00:46:10,980
content because like we don't you know

00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:14,130
this is this is from another Department

00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:15,930
of rest they don't target to a non

00:46:14,130 --> 00:46:18,570
finish audience so they just do it in

00:46:15,930 --> 00:46:19,920
Finnish and Swedish maybe so that's an

00:46:18,570 --> 00:46:21,390
interesting balance between also

00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:23,970
business requirements and doing

00:46:21,390 --> 00:46:25,950
technically but again technically we

00:46:23,970 --> 00:46:27,660
haven't seen any problems so far with

00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:35,850
things that Drupal didn't support that

00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:36,750
we needed to do no we used for the

00:46:35,850 --> 00:46:39,570
interface we use the default

00:46:36,750 --> 00:46:43,220
translations a combined with with custom

00:46:39,570 --> 00:46:46,710
ones my thing did you hire translators

00:46:43,220 --> 00:46:48,390
we had outsourced ya laters yeah yeah

00:46:46,710 --> 00:46:50,100
but not no no automation other than

00:46:48,390 --> 00:47:05,520
pulling in the default translations from

00:46:50,100 --> 00:47:07,950
Drupal adore you a question we I think

00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:10,740
this is maybe as Croesus still here did

00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:13,320
he get out of the room I creases are

00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:14,980
like designated big boy scrum master in

00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:18,790
the company

00:47:14,980 --> 00:47:20,830
he has he trains the client's he is I

00:47:18,790 --> 00:47:24,040
think he's also a product owner and all

00:47:20,830 --> 00:47:25,810
that he sometimes checks up like is

00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:28,060
everything going that's one of the

00:47:25,810 --> 00:47:29,920
things that we deviate from actual scrum

00:47:28,060 --> 00:47:32,980
a little bit with that we don't have a

00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:35,440
permanent scrum master like semi full

00:47:32,980 --> 00:47:39,730
time on the team we very much unblock

00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:41,230
ourselves so the slightly increased

00:47:39,730 --> 00:47:43,450
independence is one of the ways that we

00:47:41,230 --> 00:47:46,060
deviate from scrum that's how we like

00:47:43,450 --> 00:47:47,200
working it does require it is a bit more

00:47:46,060 --> 00:47:49,570
intense because it does require that

00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:52,260
everybody's on their feet and recognizes

00:47:49,570 --> 00:47:54,369
this themselves to support that though

00:47:52,260 --> 00:47:56,440
eighty ninety percent of the Druids are

00:47:54,369 --> 00:47:58,750
actual certified scrum masters so they

00:47:56,440 --> 00:48:01,810
know about a lot of these things they

00:47:58,750 --> 00:48:03,820
know what to pay attention to so that's

00:48:01,810 --> 00:48:06,340
how we do it yeah maybe be modified a

00:48:03,820 --> 00:48:10,090
bit like the documentation was more

00:48:06,340 --> 00:48:11,710
specific although it is it a mainly

00:48:10,090 --> 00:48:15,550
about scrum but we did more

00:48:11,710 --> 00:48:18,640
documentation or the stories and the

00:48:15,550 --> 00:48:21,030
grooming sessions were modified so we

00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:24,420
modified we kept the frame but modified

00:48:21,030 --> 00:48:29,170
the ceremonies a bit to fit our

00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:32,710
distributed teams needs better i think

00:48:29,170 --> 00:48:33,609
the to go back to scrum actually what

00:48:32,710 --> 00:48:34,840
you said in the beginning like the

00:48:33,609 --> 00:48:36,580
intensity of sprint that you have to get

00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:37,869
used to it you decided to go with one

00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:40,150
week's prints from the beginning and

00:48:37,869 --> 00:48:41,230
we're like yeah I'm sparring in that way

00:48:40,150 --> 00:48:43,300
you're like well we have all these

00:48:41,230 --> 00:48:44,740
uncertainties we have other parties that

00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:46,650
we need to coordinate look at this point

00:48:44,740 --> 00:48:50,230
we can't commit to two weeks cycles yet

00:48:46,650 --> 00:48:52,180
in the end though because it you have so

00:48:50,230 --> 00:48:54,250
many meetings yeah it's so fast-paced

00:48:52,180 --> 00:48:56,950
you really become aware after that the

00:48:54,250 --> 00:48:58,840
need to time box it and that's why you

00:48:56,950 --> 00:49:01,180
start to understand why scrum hammers

00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:03,010
this like down like you half the time if

00:49:01,180 --> 00:49:04,810
your daily is like half a minute longer

00:49:03,010 --> 00:49:07,990
than 15 minutes you're probably doing it

00:49:04,810 --> 00:49:10,810
wrong because at a scale like this it

00:49:07,990 --> 00:49:13,090
becomes very clear that it does hurt you

00:49:10,810 --> 00:49:15,250
it does because long meetings like hurt

00:49:13,090 --> 00:49:16,570
morale people start yawning like I have

00:49:15,250 --> 00:49:20,410
other to do because that person

00:49:16,570 --> 00:49:22,090
wants me to meet this deadline it's part

00:49:20,410 --> 00:49:24,280
of what helped us do this in a much more

00:49:22,090 --> 00:49:26,410
fast-paced and intense way yeah we knew

00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:28,180
what we're coming because we had the

00:49:26,410 --> 00:49:30,460
weeks we're all the same the media

00:49:28,180 --> 00:49:33,700
is were on the same time we know what

00:49:30,460 --> 00:49:36,150
the content was so no surprises we get

00:49:33,700 --> 00:49:38,859
focused on other things that just

00:49:36,150 --> 00:49:42,010
maintaining the proud the process it was

00:49:38,859 --> 00:49:44,349
it was just rolling itself and we were

00:49:42,010 --> 00:49:48,400
just doing other stuff not focusing on

00:49:44,349 --> 00:49:50,650
the crumb scrum process itself we still

00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:53,260
actually have in this project week least

00:49:50,650 --> 00:49:56,589
like one week sprints even though like

00:49:53,260 --> 00:49:58,390
Jana doesn't is not all another part

00:49:56,589 --> 00:50:00,339
owner of this project we still do it

00:49:58,390 --> 00:50:03,760
because she said like we got into this

00:50:00,339 --> 00:50:06,220
habit of being fit of exercising weekly

00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:09,400
in this case and it's just become

00:50:06,220 --> 00:50:10,599
automatic if for instance through digit

00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:12,490
sickness or something like we miss a

00:50:10,599 --> 00:50:14,380
couple of meetings that's fine we'll

00:50:12,490 --> 00:50:16,390
organize ourselves there's another

00:50:14,380 --> 00:50:20,619
sprint next week it's it's really easy

00:50:16,390 --> 00:50:23,640
to recover from from the deviations in

00:50:20,619 --> 00:50:23,640
the scrum plan as well

00:50:32,250 --> 00:50:40,720
me but permanently yeah yeah well I was

00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:42,760
the product owner at the dedicated

00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:46,780
product owner and of course we had the

00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:49,990
online team two people plus me who are a

00:50:46,780 --> 00:50:54,820
great help of course but I was the only

00:50:49,990 --> 00:50:56,290
one that was working on solely this that

00:50:54,820 --> 00:50:57,520
was part of the fun of like had that

00:50:56,290 --> 00:51:00,670
team right out and everything we met

00:50:57,520 --> 00:51:02,650
some of the other people as well again

00:51:00,670 --> 00:51:04,780
gives you you have people in support

00:51:02,650 --> 00:51:06,310
roles yes on both sides like we have

00:51:04,780 --> 00:51:09,970
like designers are you for people like

00:51:06,310 --> 00:51:11,800
we don't need to set up servers every

00:51:09,970 --> 00:51:13,630
single day of the week and we have and

00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:15,820
with that's what scrum actually allows

00:51:13,630 --> 00:51:18,550
you to do like pull in experts from

00:51:15,820 --> 00:51:20,050
outside temporarily one of the things

00:51:18,550 --> 00:51:21,730
that the weekly Sprint's also turn out

00:51:20,050 --> 00:51:23,380
to be nice because it was much easier to

00:51:21,730 --> 00:51:25,390
platinum in for a certain set of time

00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:28,210
for a whole week like a couple hours

00:51:25,390 --> 00:51:29,410
every day because if you have a two or

00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:30,370
three weeks pray that you just need them

00:51:29,410 --> 00:51:32,650
for 10 hours like how are you going to

00:51:30,370 --> 00:51:34,840
plan that in because you can't do it for

00:51:32,650 --> 00:51:36,610
the full sprint so you have to mess a

00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:42,520
lot more with your schedule to get that

00:51:36,610 --> 00:51:45,070
to work we find we found out all right

00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:48,120
then this is a wrap i think thank you

00:51:45,070 --> 00:51:48,120
