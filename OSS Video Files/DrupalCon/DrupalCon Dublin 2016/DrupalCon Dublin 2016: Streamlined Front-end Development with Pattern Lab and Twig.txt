Title: DrupalCon Dublin 2016: Streamlined Front-end Development with Pattern Lab and Twig
Publication date: 2016-09-27
Playlist: DrupalCon Dublin 2016
Description: 
	Pattern Lab and Twig, the perfect duo to streamline your front-end development process.  

Pattern Lab (patternlab.io) is “a custom static site generator that constructs an interface by stitching atoms, molecules, and organisms together to form templates and pages.” The philosophy of Pattern Lab parallels several core tenets of OOP: Don’t Repeat Yourself and Keep It Simple, Stupid.

Twig (twig.sensiolabs.org) is a fast, secure, and flexible templating engine from Sensio Labs, the people who brought us Symfony. 

In our session we will demonstrate how to combine the power of these two technologies to streamline your front-end development workflow for Drupal 8.

The original version of  Pattern Lab uses Mustache templates, but there's been a Twig version for over a year. Using the Pattern Lab starterkit for Twig (https://github.com/pattern-lab/edition-php-twig-standard), we can create patterns that map to Drupal’s Twig templates. Atoms are fields, molecules are view modes, organisms are views themselves! Eureka!!

Questions that may be teeming in your brain:

What is this Pattern Lab you speak of and what can it do for me?
What directory structure or naming conventions are required?
How can I affect the Drupal markup (custom classes) to match my pattern markup?
Relax, it’s not magic. We’ll answer these questions and more.

In our session, we will: 

Give you a brief overview of Pattern Lab
Walk you through integrating Pattern Lab with your theme
Demonstrate proof-of-concept: we'll modify some Pattern Lab templates and see those changes immediately on the Drupal site!
"Why go to all this trouble?", you might be asking yourself. We believe the strength in this approach is threefold:

All the markup is belong to us: once again we can write the markup as we want it; no more divitis (you're welcome, Morten)!
Two birds, one stone: the Pattern Lab version is visually identical to the Drupal version, and therefore can be used for client approval prior to site development
Theme it once and done: no "negotiating" Pattern Lab's markup with Drupal's
This session will be fast paced and fun, and we guarantee you'll leave with a new sense of what's possible in Drupal 8 front-end development and beyond!

good afternoon welcome my name is well

00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:07,830
we'll get to that in a second welcome to

00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:10,860
streamline front-end development with

00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:15,590
pattern lab and twig we have the slides

00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:17,730
and it will also be on the last slide so

00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:22,439
we'll start off with the introduction

00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:24,510
Who am I it's actually who are we I

00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:27,240
originally did this session in New

00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:29,880
Orleans with my colleague Chaz Chumley

00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:34,410
who unfortunately could not hop across

00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:37,200
the pond so but a little about us we

00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:40,770
both work for forum one which is based

00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:44,850
in Alexandria Virginia we work largely

00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:47,910
with nonprofits and NGOs basically our

00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:49,620
motto is if the company does good in the

00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:51,930
world agency does good in the world and

00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:54,000
we want to work with them i'm a senior

00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:56,789
front-end developer and chaz is a

00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,149
technical architect and triple

00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:03,860
evangelist and we both have kind of fun

00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:06,570
interesting not quite hobbies but

00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:08,610
extracurriculars he's a DJ and I sing

00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:10,590
opera who is at the Opry note who got

00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:13,409
your butts and free no thank you for

00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:16,710
showing up that was fun and I also am a

00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:19,740
student of kung fu and I've been doing

00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:23,159
Drupal since about 2009 and web

00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:27,090
development in general since 1998 I've

00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:30,780
done everything from logos to database

00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:35,189
schemas and worked with some really big

00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:38,689
clients Oxfam's a project I did recently

00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:41,310
we did a facelift on their intranet

00:01:38,689 --> 00:01:44,729
while it was live kind of like

00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:46,259
open-heart surgery so a little more

00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:48,119
about forum one it's we're a

00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:49,439
full-service digital agency they craft

00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:51,720
solutions for the world's most

00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:56,610
influential organizations here's a

00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:58,740
smattering of our clients and let's just

00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:00,950
get to the heart of matter of the agenda

00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:03,060
so we're going to talk about the gist of

00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:05,729
what are we talking about with this

00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:08,160
streamlined front-end development what

00:02:05,729 --> 00:02:10,080
tools are we using how we're going to

00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:13,230
put the tools together what's our recipe

00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,680
I'm going to give you a demo it's very

00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:16,650
simple

00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,000
but it's a proof of concept and then

00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:21,900
we'll up the floor to questions and I

00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,299
imagine there might be a few so never

00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:27,269
bolt your door with a boiled carrot this

00:02:24,299 --> 00:02:34,069
is an Irish proverb and not exactly on

00:02:27,269 --> 00:02:36,329
topic but a nonetheless solid advice so

00:02:34,069 --> 00:02:39,510
let's give you a little history so back

00:02:36,329 --> 00:02:42,750
at drupalcon in LA a few years ago I had

00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:45,900
a question if Drupal 8 use twig

00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:48,510
templates and the new pattern lab use

00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:51,540
twig templates could they be the same

00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:53,970
trig templates for those of you who've

00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:55,439
used pattern lab before you probably

00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:59,400
know that the original version used

00:02:55,439 --> 00:03:01,260
mustache templates and there's been this

00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:03,299
version fitting available for about a

00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:05,280
year year and a half now that also uses

00:03:03,299 --> 00:03:09,480
twig now they're not it's not quite the

00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:12,269
same how its put together in pattern lab

00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:16,349
versus how Drupal 8 uses them but there

00:03:12,269 --> 00:03:20,849
are some similarities and there are ways

00:03:16,349 --> 00:03:23,159
to using a pattern lab twig starter kit

00:03:20,849 --> 00:03:27,810
for a theme that you can begin to

00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:31,680
parallel the two and create mappings so

00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:33,419
that atoms in pattern lab will get to

00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,250
component based design anatomic design

00:03:33,419 --> 00:03:38,639
if you haven't if you're not with me

00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:41,280
here but Adams map two fields molecules

00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:46,319
to view modes organisms to views oh

00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:49,370
excuse me and so on so what are the

00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:52,620
ramifications of this approach well

00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:56,069
first front Enders we can take full

00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:58,829
control of the mark-up who has worked so

00:03:56,069 --> 00:04:01,790
far in Drupal 8 with the all right so

00:03:58,829 --> 00:04:05,699
that you know that you're in using twig

00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:09,479
we don't have to deal with display suite

00:04:05,699 --> 00:04:11,939
or views or panel eyes or clean markup

00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:13,650
to really get control the mark-up we can

00:04:11,939 --> 00:04:14,939
do it all in the templates whether or

00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:17,280
not you choose it with that lawyer you

00:04:14,939 --> 00:04:18,989
put in configuration that is a whole

00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:22,680
other issue which we will not be dealing

00:04:18,989 --> 00:04:24,719
with today what's also great about

00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,920
pattern lab is that it can be used as a

00:04:24,719 --> 00:04:29,700
version

00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:31,950
that the client can see a version of the

00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:33,540
website that the client can see but

00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:34,800
really before and they can see and

00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:37,590
improve you can demonstrate

00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:41,330
responsiveness and this can happen all

00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:43,290
before development actually even begins

00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:45,990
later on we'll give you a little brief

00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:49,860
demo of pattern lab in action on that

00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:54,150
way who is your who here has used

00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:56,820
pattern lab all right so that's good a

00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:58,820
good chunk of you so in theory we can

00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:00,690
build a site out in pattern lab

00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:04,020
theoretically before development has

00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:07,770
even started and then you can install

00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:12,000
your theme in d 8 and then presto

00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:19,020
change-o the sites already themed so

00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:21,180
that's the gist it's fun right so it's

00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:25,470
not a delay to stop and sharpen the side

00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:27,780
and apparently scythe icons are very

00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:30,240
difficult to come by so we have a wrench

00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:33,570
so let's take a look at the tools we're

00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:36,030
going to be using many of you have used

00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:38,460
any and all of these we have twig we

00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:40,770
have Drupal 8 we have pattern lab so

00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:46,050
let's go back so as everyone of the room

00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:47,970
touch Drupal 8 so far yeah and therefore

00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:49,710
and how many of you are front enters

00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:54,960
let's get I've actually feel front

00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:57,840
enters back Enders site builders project

00:05:54,960 --> 00:06:00,600
managers full stack I do everything

00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:04,740
including take out the garbage yes all

00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:06,030
right so and then pattern lab maybe

00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:07,950
those of you who've used powder lab is

00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:10,350
like this is the smallest smallest group

00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:12,900
so I'm probably being incredibly

00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:14,790
redundant here but twig fast secure

00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:16,380
flexible templating engine from sin

00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:19,410
co.labs the people who brought a

00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:21,810
symphony Drupal 8 which we as we know

00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:23,430
adopted twig as it's a templating

00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:26,250
language to more clearly separate

00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:29,880
presentation and content layers and

00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:32,190
pattern lab which is defined as a custom

00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:34,140
static site generator that construct an

00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:37,230
interface by stitching atoms molecules

00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:38,610
and organisms together to form templates

00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:41,759
and pages

00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:42,930
what we love about it is in addition to

00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:45,840
other things i listed before is that

00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:48,710
it's a philosophy parallels several core

00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:51,330
tenets of object-oriented programming

00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:57,180
don't repeat yourself and keep it simple

00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:58,710
stupid bizarro OPD ry and k is s so

00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:00,449
since pattern lab is the least

00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:03,409
well-known we're going to go okay this

00:07:00,449 --> 00:07:07,949
is going to be fun if i can figure out

00:07:03,409 --> 00:07:12,870
how to on mirror maybe that's what i

00:07:07,949 --> 00:07:16,849
need to do here if i do this i can go

00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:23,180
back wow that's really small to me

00:07:16,849 --> 00:07:26,699
escape pattern lab can you all see this

00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:29,400
so this is the pattern lab which we did

00:07:26,699 --> 00:07:31,110
for forum 1.com which is in Drupal 8 and

00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:34,349
we launched the earlier this year I'm

00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:36,539
going to give you a rundown of what we

00:07:34,349 --> 00:07:41,189
have here so this is the all page this

00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:42,360
is what it defaults to and we have I'm

00:07:41,189 --> 00:07:43,650
just going to scroll for a little bit

00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:46,469
and then I'm going to show you some of

00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:50,550
the more fun things in pattern lab we

00:07:46,469 --> 00:07:52,680
have color palette fonts headings this

00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:54,300
is how you can go ahead it's a kind of

00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:59,159
at this point looks just like a style

00:07:54,300 --> 00:08:05,190
guide blockquote but it going further

00:07:59,159 --> 00:08:09,719
down you can get dates you can do image

00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:13,110
tiles image formats and then start to

00:08:09,719 --> 00:08:16,800
put those together into article by line

00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:18,719
you can do teasers you can do like

00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:21,000
literally every element of your website

00:08:18,719 --> 00:08:22,080
can be pattern labs and then put

00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,969
together i'm going to show you how that

00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:30,289
works so over here we're looking at all

00:08:23,969 --> 00:08:33,589
base you can like I was talking about

00:08:30,289 --> 00:08:37,669
team image this is what the team image

00:08:33,589 --> 00:08:37,669
is not there that's fun

00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:46,029
there we go there's an image but the

00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:53,510
that's not as that's not interesting

00:08:46,029 --> 00:08:55,040
just like intro a little bit of text

00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:58,130
also not interesting but when you put

00:08:55,040 --> 00:09:01,310
atoms together and you can look at

00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:04,940
what's a sample you can start to put

00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:11,209
view modes together right that's the

00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:13,790
event hero you have an event teaser we

00:09:11,209 --> 00:09:22,970
got call them postcards that's not

00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:30,560
showing it for some reason oh haha

00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:32,120
that's fancy this is book this is all on

00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:34,060
panel this has all been themed and now

00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:38,110
we can go just to give you some context

00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:41,209
this is the actual form one website and

00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:43,459
we go for example to events and you can

00:09:41,209 --> 00:09:50,029
look at the event teaser let's go back

00:09:43,459 --> 00:09:52,970
to the event teaser you modes Taser

00:09:50,029 --> 00:09:57,140
aside from the fact that you don't have

00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:59,029
the margin over here that's exactly what

00:09:57,140 --> 00:10:00,730
it looked like this was done first

00:09:59,029 --> 00:10:04,310
before there was any drupal install

00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:07,430
before there was any data this got done

00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:09,440
and one of you can do all sorts of fun

00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:17,740
things we can I really can't save this

00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:21,080
small don't get old people it's terrible

00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:23,020
it's annotated keyboard shortcuts page

00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:27,200
that's not what I want on with the code

00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:28,730
code there it is so down here we now if

00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:33,529
you can see that low this is actually

00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:40,070
the markup that's the markup that was

00:10:33,529 --> 00:10:42,770
created and it shouldn't say that

00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:47,510
because this wasn't this was actually

00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:49,430
done in the version no the with the

00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:51,529
mustache this was actually done before

00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:52,430
the we started using another one in any

00:10:51,529 --> 00:10:55,010
case

00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:58,520
what's also fun about pattern lab is you

00:10:55,010 --> 00:11:01,310
can test responsiveness let's go back

00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:04,550
actually to page pick a page you can

00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:07,660
actually play around make sure

00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:11,080
everything works well and responsively

00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:15,500
this can all happen outside of drupal

00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:23,290
right questions about pattern lab yes

00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:32,120
sir no is this is a pattern lab I oh

00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:34,430
that's where it lives it's free it's a

00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:37,190
basically a templating engine that you

00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:41,720
can set up to mimic the mark-up of a

00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:53,089
Drupal site or any site really to help

00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:57,980
practice component based design yeah uh

00:11:53,089 --> 00:12:01,730
you you look I will demonstrate the

00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:04,100
templates when I do my demo for this

00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:13,790
streamlined part later okay there's

00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:15,920
another question back here yes sir yes i

00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:24,140
will i will show you the we get to that

00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:31,190
yeah all right let's see you can get

00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:34,029
back to presenting that's why i like to

00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:34,029
go up america sorry

00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:48,340
you know like that bar dear sorry that's

00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:34,730
this fun I do this wrong this one over

00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:37,779
there and my presenter view for goodness

00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:37,779
sakes sorry

00:13:50,230 --> 00:14:07,090
no I should have rehearsed this part hey

00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:09,950
we're getting somewhere all right so

00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:12,410
many of you and myself have used pattern

00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:16,760
lab and let's say triple seven where you

00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:18,710
parallel and Drupal but without twig but

00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:20,720
the catch is that any time you get a

00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:23,000
design change any change you make in

00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:29,360
pattern lab or in Drupal has to be done

00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:30,770
in both right and this is fine it's just

00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,830
you're doing everything twice in

00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:36,980
addition it's harder to keep track of

00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:38,960
greater chance of error in Drupal 7 if

00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:41,530
you're making this kind of a change if

00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:45,020
you were making this kind of a change

00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:47,180
you are doing the change in either

00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:49,040
display sweet the mark-up in Drupal

00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:53,810
you're changing in display sweet or

00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:56,900
panel eyes or any number of places and

00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:58,790
it's really hard to keep track you're

00:14:56,900 --> 00:15:00,200
practicing practically playing front-end

00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:03,470
developer and site builder at the same

00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:08,110
time not impossible but it can get more

00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:11,450
complicated but if you think about what

00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:14,930
if you think about having twig in common

00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:17,230
between pattern lab and Drupal that

00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:20,030
would be kind of amazing that would be

00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:22,610
kind of delicious which is why it brings

00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:26,120
us to the recipe who here is enjoying

00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:28,910
the Irish rude irish to like my favorite

00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:33,980
go to mail that and guinness really good

00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:38,420
stuff all right so it could fire makes a

00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:41,240
speedy cook so what if i told you that

00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:42,920
pattern lab and ruble can in fact share

00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:46,400
templates that you could phim it once

00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:50,210
and be done not repeat yourself keep it

00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:54,860
simple that you can own all the mark-up

00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:56,840
you don't have to negotiate a markup

00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:58,550
with your developers how many of you

00:15:56,840 --> 00:16:01,830
ever had to like sit down with your

00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:04,020
developer and hash out the markup

00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:09,480
you wanted interview mode versus what

00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:13,260
they were able to give you you guys are

00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:16,230
really only just a few of you it I had

00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:20,810
some stubborn developers you're lucky so

00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:23,340
or will paraphrase more for us over here

00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:25,470
you take the blue pill in the story ends

00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:27,240
you wake up in your bed and believe

00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:30,240
whatever you want to believe or you take

00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:34,130
the red pill and stay at drupalcon and I

00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,130
show you how deep the Twiggy hole goes

00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:40,230
so these are the ingredients so this is

00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:42,540
what we're working with today we have a

00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:45,360
pattern lab integrated Drupal 8 theme

00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:51,170
out of the box there's a gentleman named

00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:51,170
Alexi peoples who we owe a great debt to

00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:58,650
most of the work this session is

00:16:55,560 --> 00:17:01,650
inspired by his work and indebted to his

00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:05,910
work form one is also we have our own

00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:08,430
theme gesso which we're working on

00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:10,410
updating into this method it's not quite

00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:14,250
ready yet other things you need to be

00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:16,230
comfortable using NPM and composer Bauer

00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:22,230
used to be involved these are all

00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:25,050
packaging dependency managers in the the

00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:28,110
shila theme uses gulp as the task runner

00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:30,180
at form one and gesso we use grunt lots

00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:32,130
of battles have been fought over the two

00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:36,480
they both do the basically the same

00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:39,420
thing they they run JavaScript tasks in

00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:43,280
order or call on each other and so on

00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:45,930
etc they can compile SAS build out

00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:50,520
build-out templates clear the dribble

00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:53,400
cache etc and the piece of magic here

00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:59,160
also from Alexei is this data transform

00:17:53,400 --> 00:18:03,180
plugin that the gist of what it does is

00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:04,560
this so we're used to in twig we have

00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:06,350
the dot notation now it doesn't matter

00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:10,650
whether it was an object or an array

00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:13,230
content dot field name dot length or or

00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:15,720
however down the chain you want to go

00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:19,340
right well in pattern

00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:23,159
there's also a similar setup using JSON

00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:27,750
one JSON file / twig file such that you

00:18:23,159 --> 00:18:30,150
can also inject content into your into

00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:32,280
your pattern lab files to have certain

00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:35,700
content show up and not necessarily hard

00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:38,070
code at all in the template but with

00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:42,510
this data transform plugin allows for is

00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:45,510
it allows the pattern lab variables to

00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:48,960
mimic the twig how to lab twig variables

00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:52,370
merit mat or a mirror of the Drupal twig

00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:55,429
variables so it's the exact same

00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:58,200
variable names one pulling in Drupal

00:18:55,429 --> 00:19:00,240
from PHP into the template the other

00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:01,980
pulling from pattern lab and JSON into

00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:06,870
the twig template so there can be the

00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:09,150
same trick template and so this is the

00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:13,440
special sauce and it's like get us but

00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:18,510
not as delicious so again thanks to

00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:20,580
Alexei we really this this next

00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:22,049
generation of streamlined front-end

00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:23,760
development is really really thanks to

00:19:22,049 --> 00:19:28,559
him that's his blog and you should visit

00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:30,150
it so now it's tea time and another

00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:33,210
Irish proverb life is like a cup of tea

00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:37,320
it's all in how you make it so now we'll

00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:56,270
take a look at what is possible and we

00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:56,270
will unmute yet again since exciting so

00:19:56,809 --> 00:20:05,580
here is a pattern lab of a very simple

00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:08,750
homepage this is a site nav this is a

00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:11,110
pattern for a teaser view for speaker

00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:17,780
which

00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:20,270
you can simply see here node speaker and

00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:23,810
I have an image in another div then h4

00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:25,970
and the company name it is super basic

00:20:23,810 --> 00:20:29,990
because like I said before this is just

00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:37,040
a proof of concept in the folks I need

00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:40,090
to switch teams so we're going to make

00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:40,090
bartek our default

00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:51,919
they're out of the box this is Drupal

00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:59,390
with I have speakers of the speaker name

00:20:51,919 --> 00:21:04,970
company name and a picture no I get this

00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:08,690
stop doing this I really want I should

00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:17,929
not be mirroring why are you Mary gather

00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:24,950
winter this house that you this is what

00:21:17,929 --> 00:21:29,510
I want to show you all so this is my

00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:34,280
entrance here running on a vm keep

00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:41,299
things simpler so streamlined is it

00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:44,720
bigger here see if I can but you want

00:21:41,299 --> 00:21:49,870
bigger over here as well working is this

00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:49,870
legible now not quite

00:21:57,059 --> 00:22:01,510
no I know I'm trying to figure out how

00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:04,600
to make that bigger as well but I'm not

00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:10,020
sure I can I'm going to describe it as I

00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:15,549
go so this is the public folder public

00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:19,590
themes shyla dist is the folder from the

00:22:15,549 --> 00:22:23,440
starter kit this is basically where

00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:27,340
pattern lab is living the rest of the

00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:32,470
theme is normal templates and your

00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:37,600
normal theme files over here we go to

00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:39,460
patterns organisms node I created a new

00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:43,330
folder called node dash dash speaker

00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:50,289
dash dash teaser and there's a little

00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:52,600
style that goes with it this is this is

00:22:50,289 --> 00:22:55,059
that the new template this is what's

00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:58,419
different than the default article

00:22:55,059 --> 00:23:00,720
teaser or default teaser template I've

00:22:58,419 --> 00:23:02,980
already made it different but this is in

00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:05,740
please look here I don't know if you'll

00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:08,620
be able to see this this is in themes

00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:11,799
shyla dist patterns Oh to dash organisms

00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:16,330
nodes this isn't pattern lab this is a

00:23:11,799 --> 00:23:19,210
pattern lab template yeah here's the

00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:26,080
JSON which I'm telling you what classes

00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:27,549
to have no title for the title this is

00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:33,760
just for the pattern lab side you won't

00:23:27,549 --> 00:23:37,870
see this on the triple side in this to

00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:40,950
you and one kiss we're extending note

00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:45,789
speaker teaser HTML twig that's how

00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:50,010
pattern lab and Drupal get the same same

00:23:45,789 --> 00:23:50,010
thing so

00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:58,650
back over here in Pat our lab right

00:23:57,270 --> 00:24:00,240
let's say you get a request from the

00:23:58,650 --> 00:24:04,200
client they want to change the speaker

00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:10,370
name which is currently in H for let's

00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:10,370
say they want to make it at age three so

00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:30,450
there we go so we're going to go over

00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:32,480
here change it to h3 and run gulp I can

00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:34,920
show you the gulp file in a little bit

00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:38,580
but all it's doing is it's compiling

00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:41,480
sass it's really small isn't it we can

00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:41,480
make the bigger as well

00:24:45,929 --> 00:24:49,639
what is going on there where's my cursor

00:24:54,420 --> 00:25:05,460
basically a compiled SAS did a PL

00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:05,460
generate now we're going to go back here

00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:21,450
now it's an h3 right but you say what

00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:21,450
about drupal it's going to go back to

00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:26,760
terminal we also have to do for CR

00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:37,909
it's low I know

00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:51,100
there we go go to the dribble version

00:25:47,890 --> 00:25:52,570
and here you actually want to see any

00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:57,940
change because this is barczak and not

00:25:52,570 --> 00:26:01,480
shyla but never changed because this is

00:25:57,940 --> 00:26:05,440
actually still an h2 like it was in the

00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:07,900
other kind of template right there it's

00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:11,080
an h2 because this is not shyla this is

00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:13,690
the default teaser you're getting with

00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:18,789
any theme out of the box but we're going

00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:28,200
to go back to appearance we're going to

00:26:18,789 --> 00:26:28,200
make shyla our default back to the site

00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:33,669
you can see here that's an h3 we know

00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:39,520
because it's blue that's all I themed it

00:26:33,669 --> 00:26:40,990
right 823 to make this point I'm going

00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:43,630
to go back let's say the client changes

00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:51,010
their mind again because that never

00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:53,789
happens back to h4 right so we're going

00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:53,789
to rerun gulp

00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:06,620
all right then rerun drush

00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:28,660
there we go refresh here will expect it

00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:33,880
to be an h4 and grey again and there it

00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:37,240
is and the same thing here and that is

00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:43,090
what we're talking about dimming it once

00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:44,800
and done it's not as simple as just

00:27:43,090 --> 00:27:48,400
taking a theme out of the box there's

00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:53,560
definitely some setting up to do we can

00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:55,960
I can talk briefly about that but who

00:27:53,560 --> 00:28:00,640
here seize the power that's possible

00:27:55,960 --> 00:28:02,440
with this yeah who is who here is as

00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:23,710
excited as I am about the possibilities

00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:25,330
here yeah okay yes sir that's fine but

00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:27,760
if you have a thing that you do not have

00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:31,270
a pattern lab instance for to go ahead

00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:33,670
to go back ooh sorry keep doing that to

00:28:31,270 --> 00:28:37,450
go back and put a to create a pattern

00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:44,620
lab instance of existing site is a lot

00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:46,060
of work and not necessarily I'm think

00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:49,780
you might have some trouble convincing a

00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:51,640
client there's value in that and it

00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:53,140
depends on if the client understands

00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:57,520
component based design if they're a

00:28:53,140 --> 00:29:02,160
long-term client and that all of the lot

00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:02,160
of factors involved sir

00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:30,750
so that is that's the structure that

00:29:25,299 --> 00:29:35,230
Alexei has in his shyla theme there are

00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:37,030
several major differences in how we're

00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:40,960
going to be implementing things with our

00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:42,460
Jessa theme I don't think that you

00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:46,600
should it's one way to keep things

00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:51,490
organized to have a per component 1 s 1

00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:55,929
s CSS file on task file and do it that

00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:58,900
way in general we also have one sass

00:29:55,929 --> 00:30:02,620
file per component but we like to keep

00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:04,960
them separate so I me personally that's

00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:07,210
not how I would do it but we're not the

00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:10,150
the gesso theme isn't as far along in

00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:12,010
this in getting it set up for production

00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:14,260
so which is why I chose to use the

00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:16,030
shower theme today so it's an excellent

00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:22,960
point and I don't have a great answer

00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:31,270
for you just that it's a choice anymore

00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:32,710
questions on that yeah no it's not it's

00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:35,260
actually it's a it's a starter theme

00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:38,919
it's really really out of the box is

00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:43,240
incredibly minimal it doesn't even like

00:30:38,919 --> 00:30:48,039
that background color I did or is it

00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:51,150
here I basically threw together the

00:30:48,039 --> 00:30:53,950
background color up here and it's here

00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:56,950
let's actually just aside from that I

00:30:53,950 --> 00:31:00,880
can take you look at some of his other

00:30:56,950 --> 00:31:03,250
templates like a page article it's super

00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:05,650
super basic it's I put this together

00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:07,960
just as a to show you what's possible

00:31:05,650 --> 00:31:14,620
not to show you how fancy my theming

00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:15,980
skills are ya so yeah this is it's a

00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:27,559
very very basic theme

00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:33,530
let's sing so that was the demo which

00:31:27,559 --> 00:31:34,820
was awesome so we're coming up to lots

00:31:33,530 --> 00:31:37,690
of more questions so if you guys have

00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:41,270
them but this is these are some links

00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:45,020
you can also the you can take picture or

00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:47,690
the link to the slides is available

00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:48,799
it'll be on the last slide but here are

00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:50,750
some if you want to get involved in

00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:52,549
pattern lab one more information about

00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:54,530
the shila theme the jessica theme and

00:31:52,549 --> 00:31:59,240
there's a pattern lab chat room on

00:31:54,530 --> 00:32:09,320
guitar IM so anyone else want to take

00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:13,040
picture do that y'all second once all

00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:16,280
right um for those of you interested in

00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:18,230
going to greece in may I front head

00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:22,340
United I think we never been to a

00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:28,490
front-end United conference yeah what

00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:31,160
was that no duh I think we had this logo

00:32:28,490 --> 00:32:35,720
first but and also our ours has a little

00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:38,510
chunk out of it I'm not the creative

00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:41,270
brains at forum one I just I just make

00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:42,799
things look pretty someone else makes it

00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:45,140
someone else thinks up the pretty stuff

00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:47,690
and I put her on a website it's really

00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:50,240
simple so but anyway yes does it as I

00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:52,820
guess it is kind of similar so but any

00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:57,080
front front end United it is in next May

00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:59,120
in Greece it should be great and very

00:32:57,080 --> 00:33:02,030
warm and I don't know if I can get there

00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:07,340
but I would love to go because you know

00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:11,230
Greece now now we can go back and are

00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:11,230
there more questions sir

00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:38,940
I think I think that would totally be

00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:41,950
possible i've not done it that way but

00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:45,220
the you know the generic field markup

00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:47,160
for a drupal field not that different

00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:52,390
you know if you have your extending

00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:54,970
drupal you know twig drupal field twig

00:33:52,390 --> 00:33:57,250
templates then yeah you just add an

00:33:54,970 --> 00:33:59,020
extra class and you could make you know

00:33:57,250 --> 00:34:01,260
your orange background field or however

00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:04,600
you're you're doing it and of course you

00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:07,030
the third time's the charm adam and of

00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:09,130
course you could use it from one project

00:34:07,030 --> 00:34:10,929
to the next because a lot of these the

00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:13,330
templates the mark of itself isn't

00:34:10,929 --> 00:34:15,429
necessarily changing its the the CSS

00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:17,200
you're applying and you could choose to

00:34:15,429 --> 00:34:18,880
do it like Alexei and group them

00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:23,200
together in a directory and copy it over

00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:25,630
I mean that's that's your you're fully

00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:27,399
capable of choosing to do it that way

00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:29,290
and I don't it might even be a great way

00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:30,730
to do it I've not tried it that way but

00:34:29,290 --> 00:34:33,130
yeah that is one of the things that's

00:34:30,730 --> 00:34:36,909
possible is you can really component

00:34:33,130 --> 00:34:38,980
eyes you've the way you choose to use a

00:34:36,909 --> 00:34:41,020
search bar with you click it and it

00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:42,610
slides into the animation why would you

00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:47,730
choose to like redo that from scratch

00:34:42,610 --> 00:34:47,730
every single time yeah sir

00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:22,620
I think that there's different shops

00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:25,380
deal with the division of labor in

00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:27,510
different ways some a forum one we have

00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:29,910
some famers who are not capable of site

00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:31,410
building you have some famers who are

00:35:29,910 --> 00:35:34,380
capable I also do back-end work

00:35:31,410 --> 00:35:38,910
sometimes depends on what a project

00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:42,810
needs so in some shops choose to keep

00:35:38,910 --> 00:35:44,970
them separate to to keep the femurs out

00:35:42,810 --> 00:35:47,130
of the site building and that's one way

00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:49,860
of doing it and that's totally it's

00:35:47,130 --> 00:35:51,360
possible with pattern lab it's one of

00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:53,370
the things that pattern lab really helps

00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:55,230
make easy the Pat the femur can just say

00:35:53,370 --> 00:35:57,240
here I've done it in pattern lab here's

00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:58,680
the mark-up I want give it here the

00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:01,830
developer this is where it is in pattern

00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:05,310
lab go make it you build it this is the

00:36:01,830 --> 00:36:08,190
pattern this is the markup I need or you

00:36:05,310 --> 00:36:12,240
can go and do it all yourself like I do

00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:14,570
sometimes both are possible over there

00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,570
in the blue

00:36:40,769 --> 00:36:44,799
yeah there has to be communication

00:36:43,029 --> 00:36:47,109
between the front end are in the back

00:36:44,799 --> 00:36:49,839
end or about what what are the field

00:36:47,109 --> 00:36:54,400
names what are the variables and if

00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:55,869
they're going to be doing the making

00:36:54,400 --> 00:37:20,499
sure that on the drupal side everything

00:36:55,869 --> 00:37:22,150
looks right so this is I don't know if

00:37:20,499 --> 00:37:26,410
you can read this this is for and 1.com

00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:31,150
/ theme / gesso / pattern dash lab /

00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:35,950
public ? p equals whatever the pattern

00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:40,210
is and you can send them like for the

00:37:35,950 --> 00:37:43,749
home page you just send them this link

00:37:40,210 --> 00:37:49,719
and they can review it this is not the

00:37:43,749 --> 00:37:52,180
live site this is just pattern lab it's

00:37:49,719 --> 00:37:55,210
hose it for us we place pattern lab

00:37:52,180 --> 00:38:03,190
inside the theme because we want them to

00:37:55,210 --> 00:38:14,640
share CSS but that's a choice also sir

00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:14,640
I'll get to you next yes

00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:26,790
on so that the question is is it a

00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:28,200
little more time consuming to do things

00:38:26,790 --> 00:38:30,900
in padded lab first rather than just

00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:32,820
theme the Drupal site it is but the

00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:34,650
things that allows you to do for example

00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:37,530
pattern lab loads faster than a Drupal

00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:39,300
page you know it doesn't you don't we're

00:38:37,530 --> 00:38:41,550
not waiting seconds so it's I mean I'm

00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:43,400
just gonna refresh this and the only hit

00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:57,300
is the is the only hit is the image

00:38:43,400 --> 00:39:00,960
whereas you know what was a little

00:38:57,300 --> 00:39:04,470
slower actually not that slow but but

00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:06,750
the point is yes it does it does take a

00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:08,730
little longer but you are building out

00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:11,820
components that can be reused that

00:39:08,730 --> 00:39:13,440
already work responsibly I that don't

00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:17,460
have to be tested again once they're

00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:19,610
used as part of Drupal just question

00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:19,610
back here

00:39:58,550 --> 00:40:05,640
so to keep costs down minimal overhead

00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:09,240
instance of pattern lab that's an

00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:12,420
excellent question I'm not sure that

00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:18,060
that's a necessarily the best solution

00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:20,640
for a smaller Client it you know if

00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:21,810
there are certain for and I don't even I

00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:23,100
couldn't even come up with a number i

00:40:21,810 --> 00:40:25,020
could make something up I don't know

00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:26,400
less than 50,000 less than a hundred

00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:28,380
thousand it wouldn't make sense so be

00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:31,200
too much of a take too much of the

00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:33,510
project but yeah it's definitely

00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:39,080
definitely a concern that I'm sure some

00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:39,080
clients or shops might have yes Tom I

00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:59,250
can't speak for other themes gesso was

00:40:56,910 --> 00:41:01,950
designed by Dan new yard who is if i'm

00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:05,520
not mistaken both legally blind and

00:41:01,950 --> 00:41:13,050
legally deaf he is one of the champions

00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:14,730
of accessibility and he is brilliant

00:41:13,050 --> 00:41:17,490
it's an honor one of the things i like

00:41:14,730 --> 00:41:19,500
about form one is I'm by far not the

00:41:17,490 --> 00:41:21,330
smartest person at this company he's

00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:24,390
he's one of my he's ahead of the front

00:41:21,330 --> 00:41:26,250
end development and he's he's super

00:41:24,390 --> 00:41:29,730
knowledgeable and yes so just so our

00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:36,330
version is completely accessible like

00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:37,980
one hundred percent the it touch totally

00:41:36,330 --> 00:41:41,340
capable of supporting pattern lab can

00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:45,240
support any theme you know it's just

00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:46,980
it's a tool that you can we took gesso

00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:50,550
and we put it in a pattern lab for

00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:52,530
drupal we have gesso for wordpress you

00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:54,720
uses pattern in lab to the three are

00:41:52,530 --> 00:41:57,150
it's kind of like a triangle that they

00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:59,600
don't necessarily all lean on each other

00:41:57,150 --> 00:42:03,080
but they they do support each other

00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:03,080
question sir

00:42:21,410 --> 00:42:25,529
the data transform plugin isn't

00:42:23,759 --> 00:42:28,109
providing the variables it's pulling the

00:42:25,529 --> 00:42:29,700
variables from the JSON file that is

00:42:28,109 --> 00:42:33,049
associated with the twig template and

00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:36,660
pulling them in to pattern lab just like

00:42:33,049 --> 00:42:39,839
so that the template is the same as the

00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:43,849
drupal one which is getting its

00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:47,869
variables from PHP from symphony so the

00:42:43,849 --> 00:42:52,789
it's the basically they let me show you

00:42:47,869 --> 00:42:52,789
again the JSON file

00:42:56,710 --> 00:43:03,130
yeah so this is filled speaker image and

00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:04,720
I just hard coded it here in pattern lab

00:43:03,130 --> 00:43:07,150
you could easily just create just as

00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:09,760
easily create another component and call

00:43:07,150 --> 00:43:11,080
it to be pull in here I was trying to

00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:13,330
save myself time but this is filled

00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:15,940
speaker image this is filled company and

00:43:13,330 --> 00:43:25,960
here we have content filled speaker

00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:27,520
image and content filled company yes no

00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:29,380
you're not using them in Drupal you're

00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:31,570
just using them you're using powder the

00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:33,790
variables that you're from json to

00:43:31,570 --> 00:43:38,260
display in pattern lab so that you have

00:43:33,790 --> 00:43:40,980
dummy data to show which which would

00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:43,330
lower MIPP some text or or whatever to

00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:50,680
because if you up site on need to open

00:43:43,330 --> 00:43:58,740
viber nice Adam because if no I wanted

00:43:50,680 --> 00:44:01,180
that because if you look each home page

00:43:58,740 --> 00:44:02,890
because if you look here this is all

00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:05,530
dummy text this is all speaker name

00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:09,339
company name this is the same image this

00:44:05,530 --> 00:44:25,089
is the same teaser paddle napkin hundred

00:44:09,339 --> 00:44:29,080
four times yeah no no you could pull in

00:44:25,089 --> 00:44:31,839
you can yeah this example I chose not to

00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:33,940
do that just keep it simpler for me but

00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:39,510
yeah you can totally that is basically

00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:39,510
what pattern lab does let me

00:44:41,890 --> 00:44:47,340
just to give you I can I'm really blind

00:44:47,910 --> 00:44:53,410
speaker listing the speaker listing just

00:44:50,260 --> 00:44:55,390
it it's pulling in my organisms node

00:44:53,410 --> 00:44:57,370
speaker teaser four times that's why

00:44:55,390 --> 00:44:59,050
it's showing up four times if I took the

00:44:57,370 --> 00:45:01,030
one of these out it would show three

00:44:59,050 --> 00:45:03,700
times that's just how pattern that works

00:45:01,030 --> 00:45:19,180
if I put an extra one in there 0 4 times

00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:22,810
5 times question yes yes it's actually

00:45:19,180 --> 00:45:29,920
so it's it's Drupal's using the same

00:45:22,810 --> 00:45:34,750
file because of that extra so here is

00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:38,920
the dot HTML twig which both which are

00:45:34,750 --> 00:45:42,160
which is what Drupal is using and this

00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:44,500
which extends it is what twig is using

00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:46,780
but it's basically saying use the same

00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:48,610
one so you're only you only have making

00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:54,970
the change once you're making the change

00:45:48,610 --> 00:45:57,220
here because it drupalcon dribble can

00:45:54,970 --> 00:45:59,410
find any tweaking template inside your

00:45:57,220 --> 00:46:05,860
theme directory because that's what

00:45:59,410 --> 00:46:09,640
dribble does just searches it sir yes

00:46:05,860 --> 00:46:14,320
actually that I was about to go there is

00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:23,020
a way to is it no that's I had it up

00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:24,670
before um triple ponens i have not yet

00:46:23,020 --> 00:46:27,660
gotten to play much with this component

00:46:24,670 --> 00:46:30,220
libraries but this is something else

00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:32,970
which basically it kind of does the

00:46:30,220 --> 00:46:35,830
opposite allows you to pull drupal

00:46:32,970 --> 00:46:39,790
actual content in drupal into pattern

00:46:35,830 --> 00:46:43,650
lab using twig namespaces and I don't

00:46:39,790 --> 00:46:43,650
conclude I do not come

00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:50,759
ah like I said I don't completely

00:46:49,229 --> 00:46:52,739
understand how this one works have not

00:46:50,759 --> 00:46:54,180
used it yet but apparently it pulls the

00:46:52,739 --> 00:46:59,039
data from pattern lab and pulls it into

00:46:54,180 --> 00:47:00,869
Drupal is definitely Chaz brought this

00:46:59,039 --> 00:47:03,869
to my attention last week I've not had

00:47:00,869 --> 00:47:05,759
time to fully digest it but it looks

00:47:03,869 --> 00:47:07,079
very promising and it's entirely

00:47:05,759 --> 00:47:09,119
possible that the way what I've

00:47:07,079 --> 00:47:10,380
demonstrated today won't be the way the

00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:11,880
forum one does it maybe we'll use

00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:15,960
component libraries we're going to find

00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:20,960
the best solution that allows us to

00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:20,960
theme it once and be done in the back

00:47:22,430 --> 00:47:43,130
I'm very familiar with them they're

00:47:24,599 --> 00:47:43,130
doing very similar work as well yes

00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:55,259
they're really good they're the same

00:47:53,819 --> 00:47:58,469
that there's one instance of the

00:47:55,259 --> 00:47:59,880
template and whether you do it one way

00:47:58,469 --> 00:48:02,219
or the other I don't know which way is

00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:04,349
ultimately the best way I think they

00:48:02,219 --> 00:48:06,450
both have strengths I know that my

00:48:04,349 --> 00:48:07,650
supervisor one of the things he really

00:48:06,450 --> 00:48:10,170
likes about the way we're doing it now

00:48:07,650 --> 00:48:13,440
is that doing theming something in

00:48:10,170 --> 00:48:16,289
pattern lab only like a gentleman over

00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:17,940
here was was mentioning you don't need

00:48:16,289 --> 00:48:19,140
to actually have any real Drupal

00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:22,200
knowledge you can really just be a

00:48:19,140 --> 00:48:24,269
front-end on your own and depending on

00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:26,279
what your team is like that might be a

00:48:24,269 --> 00:48:31,769
good solution if you're doing everything

00:48:26,279 --> 00:48:35,910
maybe you want really gotta step step

00:48:31,769 --> 00:48:39,089
back if if you do if you are a full

00:48:35,910 --> 00:48:41,190
stack developer maybe you want to have

00:48:39,089 --> 00:48:43,619
the control maybe you want to be pulling

00:48:41,190 --> 00:48:46,039
the Drupal stuff into patent lab or vice

00:48:43,619 --> 00:48:47,880
versa but when you have junior

00:48:46,039 --> 00:48:49,559
developers who are just wrapping their

00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:51,809
heads around pattern lab and that's how

00:48:49,559 --> 00:48:55,469
we do things at forum won the junior

00:48:51,809 --> 00:48:59,470
developer maybe needs to be not confused

00:48:55,469 --> 00:49:01,570
by anything Drupal so they can just

00:48:59,470 --> 00:49:02,380
have the design the half pad in the lab

00:49:01,570 --> 00:49:03,940
and they're going to build it out

00:49:02,380 --> 00:49:05,349
they're going to say to the developer

00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:07,480
here's the pattern lab here's the

00:49:05,349 --> 00:49:09,790
mark-up we need please go make that

00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:11,349
happen it really just really depends on

00:49:09,790 --> 00:49:13,330
your team it's never I don't think you

00:49:11,349 --> 00:49:15,160
could ever be completely cut cut and dry

00:49:13,330 --> 00:49:18,780
it's going to depend on who you have on

00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:30,520
your team what their skill sets are etc

00:49:18,780 --> 00:49:33,190
sir um I don't you know I would assume I

00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:36,220
don't see why not you might have to have

00:49:33,190 --> 00:49:38,109
a separate instance for each theme it

00:49:36,220 --> 00:49:40,000
would depend on how you architect it i

00:49:38,109 --> 00:49:44,070
just-i can't-- to top my head I don't

00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:44,070
know yes sir

00:50:23,469 --> 00:50:28,279
so using your saying I just repeating

00:50:26,239 --> 00:50:30,739
this so I understand so using this this

00:50:28,279 --> 00:50:33,650
phase 2 it's the component libraries or

00:50:30,739 --> 00:50:36,349
it's something else only their starter

00:50:33,650 --> 00:50:39,349
kit so it's actually using their starter

00:50:36,349 --> 00:50:41,779
kit is keeps pattern lab separate and

00:50:39,349 --> 00:50:44,529
the Drupal templates pull in the pattern

00:50:41,779 --> 00:50:44,529
interesting

00:51:06,530 --> 00:51:15,180
yes you can actually do this to do that

00:51:13,830 --> 00:51:16,770
same thing here you I didn't do it in

00:51:15,180 --> 00:51:29,970
this particular case but you can extend

00:51:16,770 --> 00:51:31,530
you can use hmm yeah you could no but

00:51:29,970 --> 00:51:33,900
you could also break it down that way

00:51:31,530 --> 00:51:37,380
you could have just content and then

00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:39,930
pull in there's ways in JSON Ted to pull

00:51:37,380 --> 00:51:41,850
in into your content variable lots of

00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:44,220
different things just not how I chose to

00:51:41,850 --> 00:51:45,870
do it Jessica because I wanted to

00:51:44,220 --> 00:51:48,090
demonstrate some custom markup which

00:51:45,870 --> 00:51:51,410
sometimes because if you're not doing

00:51:48,090 --> 00:51:53,640
the markup changes in your twig template

00:51:51,410 --> 00:51:55,860
where are you doing them if you're just

00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:57,500
trying to pull in variables that's one

00:51:55,860 --> 00:52:00,540
thing but if you're actually trying to

00:51:57,500 --> 00:52:05,400
do some sort of special markup which is

00:52:00,540 --> 00:52:08,240
what the power of twig is then where do

00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:10,350
you do that now I mean do you do it in

00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:12,360
where do you change the market where do

00:52:10,350 --> 00:52:23,090
you what if you need to have a special

00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:23,090
class on a div yes you can

00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:47,750
it's interesting you should write a

00:52:41,610 --> 00:52:47,750
session on it I go I'll go I'll attend

00:52:52,250 --> 00:52:55,250
yeah

00:53:05,390 --> 00:53:09,900
got it I don't completely follow that

00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:11,660
but i've been up since five-thirty so

00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:14,130
we'll have to have another conversation

00:53:11,660 --> 00:53:17,089
