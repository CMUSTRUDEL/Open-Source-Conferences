Title: DrupalCon Dublin 2016: Leading Healthy Teams
Publication date: 2016-09-27
Playlist: DrupalCon Dublin 2016
Description: 
	The knowledge economy has changed the very nature of work, in a way which will prove to be even greater than the Industrial Revolution. Yet so many organisations attempt to apply industrial management approaches to creative knowledge workers. This leads to unhappiness, lower productivity, and even breakdown. It's not good for the organisation, it's clients, and especially for the team members. So let's change it.

Steve Parks has been leading creative teams in companies large and small since 1997. Before that he was a BBC reporter and producer managing teams in the production of radio programmes. He learned a lot from how creative people work at the BBC, and has been developing this knowledge through his career. He consistently achieves high feedback scores and loyalty from people in teams he leads.

The session will include how leaders can:

Build the foundations of trust and respect
Set the mission, and momentum
Help people be the best they can be, with continuous improvement, even if that means they will leave you one day
Set up organisational structures that support creative work rather than stifle it
Enable communications to build teams
Ensure there is emotional support for the ups and downs
Deal with problems

good afternoon everybody welcome thank

00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:08,639
you for coming along this is the session

00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:11,490
if this isn't what you're expecting then

00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:13,290
feel free to wander but if it is then

00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:15,179
for the next 45 minutes I'm going to

00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:18,210
talk about some of my experiences with

00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:19,650
teams healthy and otherwise and some of

00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:21,630
the things I've learned along the way

00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:24,390
it's also going to be some of the key

00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:27,869
slides retweeted by we are convivio

00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:29,189
that's the twitter handle there so if

00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:30,599
there's any points you particular want

00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:32,850
to pick up on they could well be on

00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:35,850
there and then the video will be live on

00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:38,309
the droop con website at the end of the

00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:39,989
session within a couple of hours and

00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:42,059
this is part of the being human track I

00:00:39,989 --> 00:00:44,250
first of all want to just take a moment

00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:47,129
to congratulate the drupal association

00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:50,370
for having this track and to thank Emma

00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:52,469
who ran this track so brilliantly it's a

00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:54,480
really great addition to drupal and a

00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:56,190
really good part of improving the

00:00:54,480 --> 00:01:00,030
culture that we have in the community

00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:02,460
and the companies and I want to talk a

00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:08,220
little bit about what i mean by healthy

00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:11,610
teams I don't mean perfection that there

00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:14,040
just isn't any such thing in teams where

00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:17,070
you have a group of human beings working

00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:21,750
together towards something we are sadly

00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:24,479
all imperfect creatures healthy teams

00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:27,290
are about recognizing that and replacing

00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:29,670
it instead with this kind of approach

00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:31,860
instead of constantly expecting

00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:34,520
perfection what we expect from team

00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:39,360
members is listening understanding

00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:43,470
thinking forgiveness and learning this

00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:46,770
culture is really important but it's

00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:49,439
really hard really hard there's probably

00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:53,579
not one single person in this room

00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:55,799
including me who is perfect at that but

00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:58,530
let remote let me remind you it's not

00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:00,680
about perfection this is what we're

00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:04,280
working towards

00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:05,990
now if this was a TED talk or I was a

00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:07,730
kind of top management consultant or

00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:10,550
something this would have a handy

00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:13,820
acronym unfortunately I'm not so the

00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:15,800
acronym is what phul so remember that if

00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:17,900
you can but listening understanding

00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:20,510
thinking forgiveness and learning are

00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:22,190
what's key now those are kind of the

00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:24,320
underlying principles but the steps

00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:26,510
towards healthy teams that we're going

00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:29,060
to work through today are these I'm

00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:30,980
going to have to go pretty quickly as

00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:32,360
you can tell but we're going to talk

00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:35,480
about leadership we're going to talk

00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:38,980
about purpose being real people self

00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:42,040
managing communication problem solving

00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:45,590
pulse and momentum in a team and

00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:48,110
continuously improving these are some of

00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:52,100
the elements that make up the idea of

00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:53,840
healthy teams a start with leadership

00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:56,209
this is how it used to be very

00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,620
traditional company you've got the

00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:59,840
leader at the top you've got some of the

00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:03,290
senior staff and they manage the teams

00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:06,230
and instructions come down reporting

00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:10,340
goes up and that hopes perfectly doesn't

00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:12,650
it Union that doesn't work perfectly of

00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:16,580
course it doesn't this was devised in

00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:18,350
the 1920s for manufacturing where they

00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:20,060
developed this idea of the production

00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:22,250
line it was revolutionary it was

00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:25,040
changing business people just needed to

00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:27,320
do repetitive tasks same thing and again

00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:29,000
and again and products would roll out an

00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:31,160
all management had to do was sit at the

00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,340
top and perfect those bits the process

00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:36,290
and tell the low-paid low-skilled people

00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:38,299
down at the bottom do that do that do

00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:40,970
that do that faster do more of that do

00:03:38,299 --> 00:03:42,530
that faster and that's all that needed

00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:45,100
to happen there and then they would

00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:49,190
mount monitor the statistics going up

00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:52,430
but the organizations that we run aren't

00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:55,400
production lines they're just not that

00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:59,630
kind of business the organizations that

00:03:55,400 --> 00:04:02,209
we run our creative teams what we hire

00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:05,600
people for our their skills and their

00:04:02,209 --> 00:04:07,820
experience not their ability to

00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:10,790
constantly and rapidly repeat exactly

00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:12,500
the same thing minute to minute hour to

00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:15,320
hour day to day

00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:18,109
this management structure no longer

00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:20,420
works for creative teams and the pain we

00:04:18,109 --> 00:04:23,060
feel in this industry is in large part

00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:26,630
down to trying to force creative work

00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:29,060
into this management structure instead

00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:31,760
management is more like this these days

00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:33,980
leadership and what that means is we've

00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:36,260
got this this is the organization or our

00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:38,300
team and I want to make clear actually

00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:39,980
in win this session that I'm not just

00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:41,900
talking about company leadership here

00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:44,480
I'm talking about team leadership this

00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:47,720
could be on projects and leadership

00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:49,070
isn't down to only one person all of the

00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:51,080
time and I'll come on to that in a

00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:53,990
moment but what you have here is the

00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:56,030
team or the organization as the one big

00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:57,740
circle and you've got the client on the

00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:59,990
outside who's coming along to this team

00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:01,880
and saying hey I've got problems can you

00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:04,970
help me with them and the whole team is

00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:08,570
providing the solutions back now in an

00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:10,580
organization like this is closest to the

00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:12,440
client who knows most about what the

00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:15,590
client problem is and what the client

00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:17,840
circumstances are it's the people on the

00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:19,760
perimeter the people doing the

00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:23,440
day-to-day work with clients who know

00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:26,990
the most and if we've hired smart people

00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:30,800
grown-up people responsible people

00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:33,860
caring people then we should just get

00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:37,310
out their way and let them do what they

00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:39,440
need to do and that perimeter is the

00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:41,510
closest point to the client and we need

00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,940
to have as many decisions happening

00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:46,130
there as possible but on the other hand

00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:47,630
the organization needs some glue the

00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:49,880
organization needs to be held together

00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:52,400
this perimeter needs to be defined you

00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:54,620
know what is our organization and what

00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:57,470
isn't it and that's part of the role of

00:05:54,620 --> 00:06:00,020
leadership but leadership is also there

00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:02,180
for coaching development support and so

00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:03,500
on so just like you have a client on the

00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:05,570
perimeter coming with problems and

00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:07,280
solutions you have the team here who may

00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:09,350
have questions and want answers or they

00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:11,750
may have feedback or ideas to change the

00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:14,090
organization and sometimes they request

00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:15,830
help from the leadership from the center

00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:18,440
of the organization it's not the top

00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:21,500
it's the center

00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:25,490
but other times because leadership isn't

00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:27,950
the job of any one person people need to

00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:31,640
move into that center and that can be

00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:33,650
anyone in the organization and that can

00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:36,650
be for a project basis it can just be

00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:39,590
for a small task and what I'm going to

00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:42,170
talk about today is how whatever level

00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:45,050
you're at in your organization you have

00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:47,660
some power to change it even if you

00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:51,230
don't think you have leadership is a

00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:53,900
mantle to be taken on by those who want

00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:56,050
to bring about change be the change you

00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:58,070
want in your organization and your

00:06:56,050 --> 00:07:00,800
organization will steadily change

00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:03,620
convince others around the perimeter and

00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:06,590
the organization will steadily change be

00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:08,060
the change that you want take on some

00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:10,490
level of leadership it can be a very

00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:13,640
small level but it makes a real

00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:17,060
difference so once you have leadership

00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:18,830
you need purpose and that's one of the

00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:21,200
key jobs of the leader is helping the

00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:24,020
team define what the organization is and

00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:25,280
what its purpose is and one of the

00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:27,230
things that we've developed for building

00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:30,169
up our small little organization and

00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:31,669
team is this idea of a pyramid of

00:07:30,169 --> 00:07:33,560
purpose and it's the things that build

00:07:31,669 --> 00:07:35,840
up in the layers you don't have to have

00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:37,100
exactly this number on each level but

00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,169
it's roughly that you're probably more

00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:40,880
like to have values and I'm sure we've

00:07:39,169 --> 00:07:42,950
all in organizations seen this kind of

00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,930
defining the values and how we going to

00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:47,510
work together its collaboration or

00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:49,820
whatever it is those will be specific to

00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:52,490
your organization working up towards

00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:54,080
purpose on the top there's a couple of

00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:57,050
things i'm going to pick out here about

00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:59,140
how to define them and remember this

00:07:57,050 --> 00:08:03,350
apply is not just the whole organization

00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:04,970
but also to project teams so think about

00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:07,250
this is something you could perhaps it

00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:09,950
down on a big project and work through

00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:12,550
with clients all as one team your team

00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:15,169
the clients team round one table

00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:17,630
collaborating on defining this and then

00:08:15,169 --> 00:08:20,840
reviewing it every few sprints how we

00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:22,430
doing on this now the values are the way

00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:25,340
the organization behaves and the team

00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:28,340
members within it behave the motivations

00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:30,050
are and I think it's important to get to

00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:32,539
the underlying thing of

00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:34,580
why we're doing this so the values of

00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:36,169
the way we behave the motivation is why

00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:38,330
we're doing this and when we were

00:08:36,169 --> 00:08:40,130
defining our little organization this is

00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:43,580
what we came up with for the four

00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:45,980
motivations these were the things why we

00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:48,140
were going to go to work every day why

00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:51,140
we were going to do the projects we were

00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:54,079
doing and we can sense check ourselves

00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:56,959
against this on a regular basis to see

00:08:54,079 --> 00:08:59,089
how we are doing in this direction but

00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:01,790
understanding that motivation is key and

00:08:59,089 --> 00:09:04,370
also surfacing it because if you don't

00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:05,570
have this conversation you end up with

00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:07,760
people in the organization with

00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:09,260
different motivations if when you're

00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:11,870
bringing people together you have this

00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:13,790
discussion you will find that someone

00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:15,140
says oh actually I don't want that I

00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:17,450
just want to get paid go home watch

00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:19,670
telly or I just want to I'm only earning

00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:21,829
money to save up so I can do around the

00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:24,100
world trip or whatever it is so it's a

00:09:21,829 --> 00:09:26,810
it's worth having this conversation

00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:28,940
really important so these the

00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:32,329
motivations why we're doing what we're

00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:34,339
doing then you build up to the focus now

00:09:32,329 --> 00:09:38,180
you may ask it first how can you have

00:09:34,339 --> 00:09:39,980
three focuses but focus is a

00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:42,829
triangulation because successful

00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:44,990
organizations have such a key focus on

00:09:42,829 --> 00:09:48,649
what it is that they are going to do

00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:52,550
that it can be so precisely specified by

00:09:48,649 --> 00:09:54,410
triangulation points so by focusing on

00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:56,029
this and that and that this is where

00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:59,300
we're aiming sometimes this bit is

00:09:56,029 --> 00:10:00,920
really difficult to describe it's really

00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:03,230
difficult to capture but if you can

00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:04,940
think of three things to focus in on one

00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:07,399
might be a sector that you're going to

00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:09,260
work in one might be a way in which

00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:12,140
you're going to work one might be a

00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:14,120
technology or an approach to work so

00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:18,560
those three things can really help you

00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:20,870
find that center point so bring it back

00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:23,600
together you end up with this pyramid

00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:25,640
building up and then your ambitions so

00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,079
these are our focuses and this is the

00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:28,910
way will behave and this is why we're

00:10:27,079 --> 00:10:30,920
doing it what are our big ambitions and

00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:33,320
there are two here because it's good to

00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:35,529
have an external I'm mission and an

00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:37,540
internal ambition

00:10:35,529 --> 00:10:39,220
so you know how do we want to change the

00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:40,569
outside world how do we want to improve

00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:42,670
things there and what are we going to do

00:10:40,569 --> 00:10:45,009
there what's our big ambition and it

00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:46,360
could be something massive or it could

00:10:45,009 --> 00:10:49,420
be something achievable in the next few

00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:51,970
years and internally what's our ambition

00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:53,860
for our organization for our team or for

00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:56,410
our project team what are the ambitions

00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:59,050
there and then those mount up so that on

00:10:56,410 --> 00:11:02,199
top you have this core purpose what is

00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:05,079
the one thing that your organization can

00:11:02,199 --> 00:11:08,350
be the best at in the world and really

00:11:05,079 --> 00:11:11,519
really focused on and for your projects

00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:14,740
why are you doing this what is the big

00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:16,600
overriding purpose it's really important

00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:19,569
to have that discussion this is how we

00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:21,399
did it for hours and a small print but

00:11:19,569 --> 00:11:22,839
the slides will be up later on and you

00:11:21,399 --> 00:11:25,029
can see just how we built up from the

00:11:22,839 --> 00:11:26,350
bottom and we're actually leaving the

00:11:25,029 --> 00:11:28,029
top two for now because we're going

00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:30,939
through a full branding exercise and

00:11:28,029 --> 00:11:32,439
those we wanted to define through a

00:11:30,939 --> 00:11:34,209
process of evolution we didn't want to

00:11:32,439 --> 00:11:35,649
just sit in a meeting room and say yeah

00:11:34,209 --> 00:11:36,910
that's what they're going to be we

00:11:35,649 --> 00:11:39,009
wanted to discover them through

00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:41,500
conversations with clients and so on so

00:11:39,009 --> 00:11:43,870
that's what we've defined there so

00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:46,839
that's purpose so you have leadership

00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:50,889
you have purpose the next you need to

00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:53,230
allow people to be real people and that

00:11:50,889 --> 00:11:55,300
in so many organizations is very

00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:57,459
difficult particularly if you're in a

00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:59,980
very large corporate and you're a small

00:11:57,459 --> 00:12:02,079
project team it can be very difficult to

00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:05,290
get your team to be real or for you

00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:06,699
yourself to be real and what does it

00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:07,990
mean I mean first of all you've got to

00:12:06,699 --> 00:12:09,819
be open and frank you've got to be able

00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:11,199
to raise those problems things that

00:12:09,819 --> 00:12:13,420
you're unhappy about things you think

00:12:11,199 --> 00:12:15,639
are wrong you got to just say what's on

00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:18,129
your mind you've also got to be free to

00:12:15,639 --> 00:12:21,250
be weird I think that's an important

00:12:18,129 --> 00:12:24,250
part tickling creative teams it's okay

00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:26,829
to be a bit weird it's okay to express

00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:28,809
yourself and be a bit random and if you

00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:30,519
look around some healthy organizations

00:12:28,809 --> 00:12:33,540
you find some really weird people and

00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:35,829
they're great I like the weird people

00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:38,230
hopefully they like me being weird too

00:12:35,829 --> 00:12:39,850
but it doesn't always and so you then

00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:42,220
need to get to know each other properly

00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:44,379
I'll talk a bit more about this in a

00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:45,790
moment but it's not enough just to you

00:12:44,379 --> 00:12:47,889
know when you bring a team together on

00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:49,930
organization together or recruit someone

00:12:47,889 --> 00:12:52,570
onto a team just go are high

00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:54,700
is Frank this is sooo T's over their

00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:56,740
kitchens their cetera et cetera that's

00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:58,600
not enough you need to get to know each

00:12:56,740 --> 00:13:01,180
other properly then you need to

00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:03,430
appreciate the differences and those

00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:05,500
differences are vital because a team is

00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:08,260
you know really is the sum of its parts

00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:10,480
and you want as many differences brought

00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:13,180
to the team as possible diversity is so

00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:16,570
important and within that equality is

00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:19,899
good sameness is bad quality does not

00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:21,459
equal sameness ok equality cuz everyone

00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:24,250
being treated fairly everyone having

00:13:21,459 --> 00:13:25,899
equal opportunities you should not try

00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:27,940
and force everyone to be exactly the

00:13:25,899 --> 00:13:30,399
same and that's not just in terms of

00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:32,230
their skill set or their clothes or

00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:34,300
whatever it is it's in terms the way

00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:37,270
they express themselves the things that

00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:38,770
make them happy and unhappy you have to

00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:41,440
allow that to come through and value

00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:43,300
that for what it brings to the team then

00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:46,690
sharing thoughts and feelings I know

00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:49,510
soft stuff but it's drupalcon it's the

00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:51,700
being human track this is vital and too

00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:52,990
often in the tech industry it's like not

00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:54,550
just got to get it done don't talk about

00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:57,190
how you feel whatever it is just got to

00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:58,779
get it done and actually what you can

00:13:57,190 --> 00:14:00,970
surface here is some really important

00:13:58,779 --> 00:14:03,430
stuff here when people are feeling a bit

00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:05,800
unhappy about something it's often a

00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:07,900
precursor to a bigger problem that's

00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:09,790
coming down the line different people

00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:12,550
have different gut feels different

00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:14,170
radars and if there have been unhappy if

00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:15,880
they want to share that that can be

00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:17,529
really important that success the

00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:19,600
project and the success of the

00:14:17,529 --> 00:14:20,830
organization I remember this thing we

00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,540
talked about the start the culture of

00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:25,420
listening understanding thinking

00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:26,980
forgiveness and learning practice what

00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:29,320
you preach take that back to your team

00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:31,270
and just think all the time how can I

00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:32,920
listen more to what's going on in the

00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:34,300
team how can I make sure that I'm

00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:36,520
understanding different people's

00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:38,200
viewpoints how can I I'm going to take

00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:40,420
myself away and have some quiet time to

00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:42,640
think and reflect on that maybe read

00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:45,310
around it or try and understand it more

00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:48,610
and then forgiveness because remember

00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:50,470
that thing there is no perfection so

00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:53,250
there'll be times you get really wound

00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:57,850
up with someone on your team that is

00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:58,720
normal sameness bad and it's going it's

00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:00,670
natural to get in

00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,259
so what you do is you express that and

00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:04,240
you look for ways that you can come to a

00:15:02,259 --> 00:15:06,310
forgiveness of each other and make that

00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:09,490
work and then all the time what can you

00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:12,430
learn what can you improve in your team

00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:13,930
and in the organization so I want to

00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:15,850
talk a little bit more about getting to

00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:17,860
know each other properly and in our team

00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:21,819
when we first got together one of the

00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:24,040
first things we did was to just pair up

00:15:21,819 --> 00:15:25,660
and have a conversation about what kind

00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:28,149
of person we are what mattered to us

00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:36,579
won't be liked what we didn't and then

00:15:28,149 --> 00:15:39,399
we drew each other this is me so I have

00:15:36,579 --> 00:15:40,990
a beard a small beard I like to write I

00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:42,759
have the pen and paper and I'm not a

00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:46,209
morning person so I'm in my dressing

00:15:42,759 --> 00:15:47,949
gown so that was a brief expression but

00:15:46,209 --> 00:15:49,689
it was just a fun way of getting the

00:15:47,949 --> 00:15:50,860
conversation going but it was the

00:15:49,689 --> 00:15:52,810
precursor to doing something a little

00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:54,939
bit more which was a bit of a map of

00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:57,370
what are our work skills and this is

00:15:54,939 --> 00:15:59,889
someone else in the team prepared mine

00:15:57,370 --> 00:16:02,410
and talking amongst themselves it's well

00:15:59,889 --> 00:16:04,329
what is was he good at was he not so

00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:06,790
good at how we going to do use those

00:16:04,329 --> 00:16:09,639
skills within the team and that's a

00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:11,439
starting point just mapping out what are

00:16:09,639 --> 00:16:13,000
people's strengths and weaknesses and so

00:16:11,439 --> 00:16:15,069
on what are they good at and what are

00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,319
their specialisms but I want to take

00:16:15,069 --> 00:16:18,639
that a bit further and we haven't done

00:16:17,319 --> 00:16:20,290
it yet but I want to take it further

00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:22,420
into something called personal mapping

00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:23,889
and if you google you can find out lots

00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:25,959
of other people's personal maps it's a

00:16:23,889 --> 00:16:28,649
common thing but it's essentially like a

00:16:25,959 --> 00:16:32,199
mind map where you get to know somebody

00:16:28,649 --> 00:16:35,050
through talking with them and mapping

00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:36,819
out a mind map of what they're like so

00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:38,740
you know talk about their life dreams

00:16:36,819 --> 00:16:40,420
and goals talk about their work skills

00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:42,339
interests and goals talk about their

00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:44,319
leisure and personal interests you know

00:16:42,339 --> 00:16:45,990
who knows some new recruit comes in and

00:16:44,319 --> 00:16:48,160
you show them the existing teams

00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:50,230
personal maps and get them to map out

00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:52,329
there's one of the first tasks you go

00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:53,769
all right you like so and so too are we

00:16:52,329 --> 00:16:55,540
like this why don't you come and join in

00:16:53,769 --> 00:16:58,180
with that and you just instantly help

00:16:55,540 --> 00:17:00,279
people have become a more cohesive team

00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:02,709
what they love and hate what's this

00:17:00,279 --> 00:17:05,289
style of working and you know there's

00:17:02,709 --> 00:17:07,329
all sorts of little weird niggles that

00:17:05,289 --> 00:17:09,510
people have about I hate it when people

00:17:07,329 --> 00:17:12,480
do this or I love it when people do that

00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:14,069
and what more can you think of

00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:16,230
so maybe with your team one of the

00:17:14,069 --> 00:17:19,530
takeaways is to go back and think about

00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:21,540
doing this kind of personal map how

00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:22,829
could you express yourselves and make it

00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:25,410
so that people can get to know each

00:17:22,829 --> 00:17:27,419
other through talking about their

00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:29,460
interests and what motivates them and so

00:17:27,419 --> 00:17:31,950
on because it all adds up towards

00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:35,610
allowing people to be real people and

00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:37,350
that is really important so you want

00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:39,120
leadership you've got purpose you've got

00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:41,460
real people on the team who you're

00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:43,950
allowing to be real people then you need

00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:46,620
to set them a bit freer and it's self

00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:49,500
managing that's the name of the game now

00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:52,080
this is so important because you've

00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:55,860
hired these smart people you've hired

00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:59,160
creative people you've hired adults I

00:17:55,860 --> 00:18:00,330
presume you know but I'm the thing is

00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:02,760
then why do you put so much

00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:04,559
micromanagement in an organization why

00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:07,799
do you tie their hands with so many

00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:09,690
rules and forms and whatever else why do

00:18:07,799 --> 00:18:13,070
you make them get permission for even

00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:15,900
the tiniest of things set them free

00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:17,850
create a culture of self managing and

00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:21,059
what you'll find is an organization that

00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:22,919
takes responsibility team members that

00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:24,600
take responsibility for supporting each

00:18:22,919 --> 00:18:27,660
other for looking after each other and

00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:29,850
it bonds a team together so tightly that

00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:31,980
they can weather even the largest of

00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:34,380
problems because they are addressing

00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:35,460
them together now how do you do this

00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:38,309
well first of all you plan everything

00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:40,230
together there's not the concept of the

00:18:38,309 --> 00:18:42,090
leader going and sitting in a darkened

00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:44,610
room and going right what am I going to

00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:46,530
tell everyone to do that just doesn't

00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:48,990
work you plan to gathering your planned

00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:51,059
reopening transparency of key

00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:52,890
information is important because if

00:18:51,059 --> 00:18:55,380
you're going to expect people to make

00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:56,850
decisions like about when they're going

00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:58,169
to take holiday how much holiday going

00:18:56,850 --> 00:19:00,390
to take what expenses are going to spend

00:18:58,169 --> 00:19:01,890
on what conference is to go to what

00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:02,970
they're going to buy for the team what

00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:05,220
they're going to both the client what

00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:06,270
they're going to do etc then they need

00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:08,190
to have the information at their

00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:10,470
fingertips that you would have as a

00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:13,890
leader if you were making the same

00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:15,960
decision that means opening up the

00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:17,730
finances the team should know what's

00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:19,980
going on how can you make some kind of

00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:22,530
dashboard available means opening up

00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:24,930
other key data pipeline things like that

00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:27,120
what can you open up about

00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:29,280
to make your organization very

00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:31,770
transparent radically transparent

00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:34,980
because that will also bind the team

00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:37,410
together then this is often the most

00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:40,200
difficult one making problems very

00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:42,600
visible and solving them together it's a

00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:45,870
very human thing when something's going

00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:48,090
wrong or there's some kind of big stress

00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:50,670
in the organization to kind of put it

00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:51,810
under the carpet you go wow I'm sure

00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:53,280
it'll be alright in a month or two I

00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:55,140
don't want to just have to raise it have

00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:57,690
a big conversation and all that sort of

00:19:55,140 --> 00:20:00,420
thing I bet it just grows that way you

00:19:57,690 --> 00:20:03,450
have to make problems visible amongst

00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:05,910
the team and solve them together because

00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:08,520
you have the power of these multiple

00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:11,130
brains and different backgrounds

00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:13,110
different experiences and you can make

00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:16,080
the most of that in your organization if

00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:20,130
you allow it to be free and the team

00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:21,330
solve problems together and then put you

00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:23,340
know take all the decisions that are

00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:25,050
managed with making an organization how

00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:26,820
can you make those decisions by peer

00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:28,800
review instead why do you need a manager

00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:30,210
always why do you have to wait for

00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:32,580
someone to be available to get

00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:34,410
permission for this that or the other so

00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:35,760
one of the really powerful things to do

00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:37,650
is say look for something that's a

00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:40,530
really small expense just sort of

00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:42,300
doubting yourself it's fine it's

00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:44,790
absolutely fine you know just sort it

00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:48,060
out but for something bigger talk to any

00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:49,860
sensible colleague any sensible

00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:51,810
colleague and if they approve then

00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:54,330
that's it because as long as they know

00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:57,210
the key information they can make key

00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:59,100
decisions and they have to have that

00:20:57,210 --> 00:21:01,380
available so peer review is something we

00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:03,570
find works really well that's also

00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:06,330
partnered with the buddy system for

00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:08,610
support and growth so whenever anyone

00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:13,020
joins we budding them together with

00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:15,270
somebody and they then and take time on

00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:18,300
a regular basis every couple of weeks to

00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:20,040
just talk stuff over how are things

00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:21,660
going what have you been working on what

00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:23,910
have you learned this week what's a

00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:26,460
problem that you're facing and a regular

00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:28,860
basis and if something comes up they can

00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:31,110
talk about it then one on one and it's

00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:34,770
just a very safe place where you can

00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:36,720
just vent if you need to or boast if you

00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:38,130
want to and just have someone who

00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,830
understands you and has worked with you

00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:42,039
for a while

00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:44,640
and can make it happen then another

00:21:42,039 --> 00:21:47,230
important thing is working out loud if

00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:49,149
you're going to be a self managing team

00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:51,190
everybody needs to know what everyone

00:21:49,149 --> 00:21:52,899
else is doing because otherwise you're

00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:54,580
in the dark so everyone all the time

00:21:52,899 --> 00:21:56,740
whenever they're starting on you know

00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:59,350
doing a particular feature or issue or

00:21:56,740 --> 00:22:00,820
something in a meeting whatever just be

00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:03,130
chatting about it in the chat channel

00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:04,600
just have one place where people know

00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:06,580
they can go and find out whatever is

00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:08,470
going on in the organization work out

00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:10,149
loud say what you're working on say when

00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:13,860
you finish say what's going well and

00:22:10,149 --> 00:22:17,049
just the maximum communication possible

00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:20,769
micromanagement kills self management

00:22:17,049 --> 00:22:23,980
and teams and so many agencies have got

00:22:20,769 --> 00:22:25,419
into this over doing time tracking it's

00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:27,429
a whole different subject but really

00:22:25,419 --> 00:22:29,769
agencies shouldn't be selling by the

00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:31,960
hour these days it's just not a

00:22:29,769 --> 00:22:34,539
productive way of working but so many of

00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:37,179
them have these incredibly over-the-top

00:22:34,539 --> 00:22:39,460
time tracking systems where it's in six

00:22:37,179 --> 00:22:40,929
minute blocks or it's this or it's 15

00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:42,549
minute blocks and you've got all these

00:22:40,929 --> 00:22:45,789
categories you've got to choose from and

00:22:42,549 --> 00:22:47,860
so on and it drives people nuts it

00:22:45,789 --> 00:22:50,559
really drives people nuts how can you

00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:53,350
free them up from that and still have

00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:56,200
that relationship with clients and be

00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:58,510
selling by the days or be selling value

00:22:56,200 --> 00:23:01,450
by the Sprint's or whatever and release

00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:04,059
people from this time tracking burden so

00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:06,880
that's self managing communications is

00:23:04,059 --> 00:23:11,380
the next thing and I mention it briefly

00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:14,620
there but it's really really key to

00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:16,330
consider communications actively too

00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:18,760
often in organizations they kind of

00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:20,230
happened passively you know its just oh

00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:22,210
yeah that meeting happen and this will

00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:25,000
happen and rob a bar and you don't

00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:27,519
really think through what your

00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,960
communications are at all and have the

00:23:27,519 --> 00:23:32,289
principles and you don't make the most

00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:34,870
of them I know it's all too easy and so

00:23:32,289 --> 00:23:36,399
impersonal on the wall is a really key

00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:39,909
thing if you are going to get together

00:23:36,399 --> 00:23:42,130
and this is vital even for distributed

00:23:39,909 --> 00:23:44,590
teams where a distributed team but we

00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:46,870
get together for a whole day every two

00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:48,850
weeks and we just go work together

00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:50,649
sometimes we have a workshop session

00:23:48,850 --> 00:23:52,010
together whatever it is but every two

00:23:50,649 --> 00:23:53,930
weeks we're together

00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:55,520
if you're in the same office it's even

00:23:53,930 --> 00:23:57,620
easier but you have these kind of

00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:59,960
sessions where either you're doing a

00:23:57,620 --> 00:24:01,460
retrospective or you're doing a planning

00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:03,860
for the next quarter or whatever it is

00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:05,690
do it on the wall make it very visual

00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:08,450
make it active have people moving around

00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:10,280
and as well as being very visual for

00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:14,960
in-person meetings have some core

00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:17,810
principles what are your core principles

00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:20,720
for meetings you know are they defined

00:24:17,810 --> 00:24:22,780
do people know what to do for us it's

00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:24,950
things like showing up on time is late

00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:26,960
because if you should have meetings at

00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:28,640
four you show up at four then you've got

00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:31,400
a bit of time getting a laptop open etc

00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:33,470
etc show up in time for the meeting to

00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:35,330
start at four you can get all the

00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:39,500
chitchat out of the way first have a

00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:41,390
coffee etc on time is late then also

00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:43,400
every meeting has to have someone who's

00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:45,860
leading it even if it's you know just a

00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:47,630
team thing someone is leading the

00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:49,460
meeting making sure that there's a

00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:51,560
structure making sure there's a time box

00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:53,090
making sure the meeting is productive

00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:54,410
make sure different people are getting

00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:57,020
their chance for their voices and

00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:58,970
there's other meeting culture things as

00:24:57,020 --> 00:25:00,860
well meeting principles but what would

00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:03,590
yours be perhaps you as a team could

00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:05,060
define what your meeting principles are

00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:08,180
how are you going to make meetings

00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:10,400
better for everybody because all too

00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:12,880
often in agencies are here people say

00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:16,760
I've got to go to another meeting our

00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:20,540
meetings I tell you something in the

00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:22,280
creative industries meetings are one of

00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:25,790
the things we do because they're a key

00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:27,920
form of communication if you heard your

00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:30,310
surgeon say I've got to go into the

00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:33,440
bloody operating theatre again oh god

00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:35,840
then you'd be a bit worried what we do

00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:37,610
is meetings we meet with clients we meet

00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:39,080
with each other that's where we catch up

00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:40,820
on information that's where we share

00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:44,870
things that's where we make key

00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:47,540
decisions and we plan meetings are key

00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:50,660
to what we do not an annoyance that gets

00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:52,430
in the way so make them work in terms of

00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:54,890
other forms of communication they've

00:25:52,430 --> 00:25:57,440
covered in person also virtual meetings

00:25:54,890 --> 00:25:59,540
has anyone ever had that Google Hangouts

00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:02,270
think of your microphones not working

00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:05,100
can you hear me you know I can't hear

00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:07,140
you still try another browser everyone

00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:09,270
has that Skype a whole hangouts or

00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:11,280
whatever it is so have the same

00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:13,440
principles start early get that figured

00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:15,900
out have everyone have the same headset

00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:18,240
or speaker or something like that what

00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:20,400
are the things you can do that will just

00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:23,160
make virtual meetings work better for

00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:25,230
you I've even done things where take an

00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:26,970
iPad along to a meeting where one person

00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:29,340
is going to be on a virtual meeting and

00:26:26,970 --> 00:26:31,950
put them at the end of the table in an

00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:34,200
actual place so that people turn speak

00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:36,840
to them and they can have a person's eye

00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:38,789
view of the meeting and just think what

00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:41,640
can you do to make a virtual meeting

00:26:38,789 --> 00:26:42,990
more productive as well one of the

00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:45,120
things we do is because we're a

00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:46,530
distributed team we put more effort into

00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,960
this but you can do the same in an

00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:51,419
office too is the tea break culture

00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:53,250
maybe it's just an English thing but we

00:26:51,419 --> 00:26:55,200
like tea breaks you know it's good to

00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:58,110
have a cup of tea and a biscuit and it's

00:26:55,200 --> 00:27:00,030
a great chance just to relax with your

00:26:58,110 --> 00:27:02,370
team relax with your colleagues catch up

00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:04,740
talk about other stuff and that's where

00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:06,090
serendipity happens when you've got a

00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:09,270
couple of people get together and have a

00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:12,419
cup of tea so we're distributed so or

00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:13,799
free-range as we call Anjali its and we

00:27:12,419 --> 00:27:15,240
just say in the chat Channel hey I'm

00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:17,820
going to put the kettle on does anyone

00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:19,470
fancy a tea break in five minutes and we

00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:21,570
just get on for the length of our cup of

00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:23,520
tea have a chat in the ketchup and it

00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:26,280
really helps that team spirit really

00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:28,230
helps bonding together and on that note

00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:30,929
chat channels whether it's in a slack

00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:33,809
HipChat sky whatever you use to chat to

00:27:30,929 --> 00:27:35,490
others think about how you do it how can

00:27:33,809 --> 00:27:37,110
you make it more effective what are the

00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:39,780
principles that you're going to do there

00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:43,350
because having a healthy team that

00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:46,289
constant day-to-day communication is key

00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:48,030
to it and so do it consciously mindful e

00:27:46,289 --> 00:27:51,090
rather than just doing our randomly

00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:53,100
whatever I feel like key one for us is

00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:55,140
eating together we're a company that's

00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:57,090
all about kind of good food good times

00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:58,530
getting around a table together but

00:27:57,090 --> 00:28:00,780
actually it's really important for human

00:27:58,530 --> 00:28:02,789
beings generally particularly when

00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:05,010
you're celebrating something or there's

00:28:02,789 --> 00:28:06,720
a big milestone whatever it is get

00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:09,510
together whether it's just lunch or

00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:11,690
dinner and hey tech industry we could

00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:14,010
try something other than pizza

00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:16,290
revolutionary you know get imaginative

00:28:14,010 --> 00:28:18,240
and do something nice I've had you know

00:28:16,290 --> 00:28:20,730
team round to mine from Cook's

00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:22,380
that kind of thing so do whatever it is

00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:24,030
that works for your company in your

00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:27,030
culture but get together share a meal

00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:28,470
talk about stuff and that leads on to

00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:31,650
this final one appreciating and

00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:34,350
celebrating it's not just enough to just

00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:35,790
do the same thing day in day out and you

00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:38,880
know just on to the next on to the next

00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:42,510
on to the next you have to take that

00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:44,790
time to stop recognize what people are

00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:47,160
doing appreciate it and actually thank

00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:49,440
them one of the things that my colleague

00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:50,910
Joe Baker came up with is you know what

00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:53,670
these days all that comes through the

00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:55,410
post box is bills wouldn't it be nice

00:28:53,670 --> 00:28:57,450
every now and then just to get a thank

00:28:55,410 --> 00:28:58,800
you card or something so one of the

00:28:57,450 --> 00:29:01,260
things that we've started doing ad-hoc

00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:03,540
is no sort of schedule it's just when

00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:06,450
something good happens just get a card

00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:08,490
send a card and say thanks and you know

00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:09,990
how nice it is in the morning to pick

00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:11,940
that up the doormat and just get ha

00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:14,730
someone actually went to one of those

00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:16,410
old farts old-style post boxes it's

00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:18,590
better than an email and just think of

00:29:16,410 --> 00:29:22,470
what you can do for appreciation and

00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:25,429
celebration so you've got all of those

00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:27,960
elements leading towards problem solving

00:29:25,429 --> 00:29:29,610
spoiler alert there will always be

00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:30,900
problems remember that thing I said at

00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:34,080
the beginning there's no perfection

00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:35,520
there really isn't even in a team that's

00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:37,740
worked together well for a long time

00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:40,679
problems will come up problems will come

00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:43,320
up day to day that is what we do we are

00:29:40,679 --> 00:29:45,720
problem solvers so we need to do it

00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:47,370
within our own teams as well as for the

00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:50,700
clients so if there are going to be

00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:52,500
always problems why do we tend to wait

00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:54,570
until they come up and then just

00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:56,160
randomly go ah and generally when it's

00:29:54,570 --> 00:29:57,470
too late oh god we've got to do

00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:59,400
something about it must have a meeting

00:29:57,470 --> 00:30:02,040
what you should be thinking about is how

00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:05,130
can we actively seek out those problems

00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:06,570
at an early stage and what are we going

00:30:05,130 --> 00:30:09,170
to have as a framework for dealing with

00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:11,460
them so these are the seven steps and

00:30:09,170 --> 00:30:13,890
first of all you have to actively gather

00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:15,870
problems it's not just enough to wait

00:30:13,890 --> 00:30:19,050
until something comes up as a big

00:30:15,870 --> 00:30:23,010
problem you have to actually actively

00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:24,720
gather it and that means perhaps you

00:30:23,010 --> 00:30:26,070
have regular meetings maybe you're

00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:27,630
having retrospectives and you're

00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:29,610
gathering problems that come up there

00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:31,530
maybe you have in your weekly team

00:30:29,610 --> 00:30:31,870
meeting what problems have win countered

00:30:31,530 --> 00:30:34,030
this

00:30:31,870 --> 00:30:35,740
week and raise those maybe it comes out

00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:37,450
of the buddy system and this isn't just

00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:39,820
problems in the way the team works it

00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:44,200
can be really small things like you know

00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:46,600
we need a better way of you know holding

00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:48,130
this kind of meeting or you know we find

00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:49,990
that it's really difficult to get this

00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:52,450
client to do retrospectives or whatever

00:30:49,990 --> 00:30:54,460
it is raise it as a problem then you

00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:56,710
study it you look into it or what might

00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:58,870
be the root causes of this you dig down

00:30:56,710 --> 00:31:00,430
into it then you generate multiple ideas

00:30:58,870 --> 00:31:02,710
well how could we address those root

00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:05,170
causes you select a couple of ideas that

00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:07,990
look likely you test them you then

00:31:05,170 --> 00:31:10,090
review those tests and what's worked you

00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:12,640
adopt as your standard practice across

00:31:10,090 --> 00:31:15,040
the organization so if you think about

00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:17,200
this that's just the agile process isn't

00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:18,340
it you're just working through you're

00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:20,470
looking at what's going on you're

00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:22,840
planning your testing stuff out your

00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:24,670
prototyping and you're learning and then

00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:28,929
you're adopting it and deploying it to

00:31:24,670 --> 00:31:31,420
production so that's all part of

00:31:28,929 --> 00:31:35,200
building towards a pulse and a momentum

00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:36,940
in the organization because it's not

00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:38,920
enough just to have that cycle of

00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:40,750
projects you also feel that you need to

00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:42,910
build somewhere and I don't know if

00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:44,710
you've ever felt in your agency that it

00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:46,330
just feels like it's that relentless ah

00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:47,650
we finished this project for this client

00:31:46,330 --> 00:31:49,179
now we've got to go into this project

00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:51,670
for this client now we've got to run to

00:31:49,179 --> 00:31:54,040
this project for this client but how is

00:31:51,670 --> 00:31:57,960
the organization developing how is the

00:31:54,040 --> 00:32:00,490
team developing through that it feels

00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:03,130
relentless it feels like you're on a

00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:06,790
treadmill and you know where is the end

00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:08,980
in sight so if you can have a pulse to

00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:11,080
your business and that feeling of a

00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:12,940
momentum it can feel like your

00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:14,380
organization is making more progress and

00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:17,470
maybe it already is but people just

00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:19,059
don't recognize but that pulse so one of

00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:21,730
the things that we take as an approach

00:32:19,059 --> 00:32:23,770
is we work on a quarterly basis and

00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:26,200
beginning of each quarter we define what

00:32:23,770 --> 00:32:28,360
our big rocks are now as anyone I've

00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:29,950
seen the talk by Stephen Covey about

00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:31,929
where he puts different rocks in a jar

00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:33,910
don't know if anyone has but what he

00:32:31,929 --> 00:32:36,160
does he takes a couple of two jars and

00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:38,630
he's got pile of big rocks pile of

00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:41,360
smaller rocks and a pile of gravel

00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:42,710
and what he shows is that if you start

00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:44,330
with the gravel all the little small

00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:46,280
jobs that need doing or a little bits

00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:48,530
and pieces and you put that gravel in

00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:50,330
the jar and then you take the medium

00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:52,520
sized rocks and you put them in the jar

00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:54,860
then you come to put the bigger rocks in

00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:57,500
and there isn't room because you know

00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:59,480
it's all kind of compacted together but

00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:01,730
if you start with the big rocks put

00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:03,980
those in they all fit in the medium

00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:06,050
sized rocks they all fit in and they

00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:08,120
fall among the big rocks and then the

00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:09,740
gravel and it pours in amongst all the

00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:12,560
cracks all the little jobs fit in

00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:14,360
amongst everything else so if you don't

00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:17,330
take those big rocks and put them into

00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:19,700
your planning first for your team or

00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:21,620
your organization then they don't happen

00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:25,850
they don't get done you don't get that

00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:27,890
feeling of forward motion of momentum so

00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:29,450
we start each quarter with the big rocks

00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:31,040
what are the you know we tend to have

00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:34,370
about three things what are the three

00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:36,050
things that must happen this quarter to

00:33:34,370 --> 00:33:40,010
make us feel that our business has

00:33:36,050 --> 00:33:41,780
momentum and we make sure those are done

00:33:40,010 --> 00:33:44,510
in the quarter and we have a monthly

00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:46,610
review of all of those what actions have

00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:51,110
been done towards them what need to be

00:33:46,610 --> 00:33:53,150
done what can we shed Yulin so that is

00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:55,220
the pulse it's the quarterly to monthly

00:33:53,150 --> 00:33:56,840
and then that falls down to a weekly

00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:58,340
thing we have management Monday's where

00:33:56,840 --> 00:34:00,380
a couple of us get together and just

00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:03,170
work through all the smaller tasks so

00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:05,330
it's big rocks smaller rocks gravel you

00:34:03,170 --> 00:34:07,880
work through that pulse what is your

00:34:05,330 --> 00:34:10,250
organizational pulse what keeps things

00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:12,320
ticking what is that momentum that you

00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:15,409
can build up to go forward because of a

00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:18,860
team feels that it has that momentum it

00:34:15,409 --> 00:34:21,080
feels like it can do anything and that

00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:22,879
is a key thing of a healthy team that

00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:26,090
feeling of wow together we can do

00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:29,629
anything we can overcome any problem and

00:34:26,090 --> 00:34:33,659
that comes from that feeling of momentum

00:34:29,629 --> 00:34:35,070
and then that follows on to continuously

00:34:33,659 --> 00:34:39,119
improving now you'll know about this

00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:41,520
from the agile process and I'm sure many

00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:44,129
of us do it on projects you have that

00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:45,270
retrospective every couple of Sprint's

00:34:44,129 --> 00:34:48,419
or make me know maybe if you're good

00:34:45,270 --> 00:34:52,530
every sprint so many projects don't know

00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:56,129
and very few agencies do them for

00:34:52,530 --> 00:34:58,800
themselves when was the last time you've

00:34:56,129 --> 00:35:00,869
got everybody together and you just did

00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:02,670
a complete retrospective of however the

00:35:00,869 --> 00:35:04,940
last three months gone what problems

00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:08,460
have we had what can we learn from them

00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:10,530
when was that time and if it wasn't

00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:12,930
recently when could you shed electrode

00:35:10,530 --> 00:35:15,540
ulit for again because just like an

00:35:12,930 --> 00:35:18,270
agile process you want to continually

00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:21,300
learn from everybody and have everybody

00:35:18,270 --> 00:35:23,490
feeding in ideas for improvement feeding

00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:26,310
problems that came up and continuously

00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:28,859
improving the organization now on this

00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:33,060
I'd really recommend a book it's by the

00:35:28,859 --> 00:35:35,280
founder of Pixar and in it he is called

00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:37,920
creativity inc and in it he describes

00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:39,930
their notes process in the creative

00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:42,210
industry there's a lot of delicate

00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:45,320
people which of course in in tech were

00:35:42,210 --> 00:35:47,880
much much tougher as an instrument we

00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:49,920
okay in work there's a lot of delicate

00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:53,010
people all of us are delicate to some

00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:56,430
degree and so giving feedback and in

00:35:53,010 --> 00:35:58,440
asking people to improve is tough it is

00:35:56,430 --> 00:36:00,720
really tough so Pixar have developed

00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:02,490
their notes process and principles and

00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:04,770
if you google out you can find out a bit

00:36:02,490 --> 00:36:06,810
more as well but they have a note stay

00:36:04,770 --> 00:36:08,130
on a regular basis where they get

00:36:06,810 --> 00:36:10,010
together and do that not just for the

00:36:08,130 --> 00:36:14,730
films but for the way the organization

00:36:10,010 --> 00:36:17,070
runs and having a note stay or a notes

00:36:14,730 --> 00:36:19,440
afternoon or whatever you can do will

00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:22,130
really help to continuously improve your

00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:22,130
organization

00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:28,319
so these are some of the key points that

00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:30,599
we've considered their leadership

00:36:28,319 --> 00:36:33,619
purpose allowing people to be real

00:36:30,599 --> 00:36:37,470
people self managing set people free

00:36:33,619 --> 00:36:40,079
communication constantly problem-solving

00:36:37,470 --> 00:36:41,849
expects the problems welcome the

00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:45,510
problems because they are your chance to

00:36:41,849 --> 00:36:50,130
improve pulse and momentum and then

00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:52,380
continuously improving I mentioned

00:36:50,130 --> 00:36:55,010
earlier this concept of if you want to

00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:57,180
change the organization be the change

00:36:55,010 --> 00:36:59,819
that's really important because there'll

00:36:57,180 --> 00:37:01,589
be people in this room who aren't a CEO

00:36:59,819 --> 00:37:04,950
of the organization or aren't the leader

00:37:01,589 --> 00:37:07,020
of their team but that doesn't mean you

00:37:04,950 --> 00:37:09,240
can't bring about change in your team in

00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:13,290
your organization and steer it towards a

00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:16,260
healthier approach everybody in the

00:37:13,290 --> 00:37:18,210
organization so we discussed here can

00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:20,460
move to the center some point even if

00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:23,280
they put that hat on themselves quietly

00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:24,720
and never say I am now a leader they

00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:26,730
could just get people together for a

00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:28,920
meetup what if you started getting

00:37:26,730 --> 00:37:30,960
people together for a you know better

00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:33,060
project teams meet up and sharing

00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:35,849
experiences and you started filtering

00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:37,920
out these ideas and other ideas to your

00:37:35,849 --> 00:37:40,260
ganization just through a peer group

00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:42,060
meetup it's not you know big serious

00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:44,339
thing but it's a demonstration of

00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:46,230
leadership to organize that and bring

00:37:44,339 --> 00:37:48,990
those people together and seed those

00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:51,690
ideas in the organization what are the

00:37:48,990 --> 00:37:55,339
things that you could do in order to

00:37:51,690 --> 00:37:55,339
make that happen within your team

00:37:55,760 --> 00:38:01,650
so step to the center and take on some

00:37:58,650 --> 00:38:03,359
leadership mantle there's a couple of

00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:05,819
points I want to make in general about

00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:09,770
organizations that lead to unhealthy

00:38:05,819 --> 00:38:13,980
culture our people are our greatest

00:38:09,770 --> 00:38:16,170
asset you hear that sending you big

00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:17,730
companies the chief executive will go to

00:38:16,170 --> 00:38:19,530
a conference and I'll stand at the front

00:38:17,730 --> 00:38:21,480
and you know he'll be making

00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:23,640
announcements about the quarter and

00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:25,790
that's something yeah so I want to make

00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:30,059
clear that our people are our greatest

00:38:25,790 --> 00:38:32,790
asset and I I mean I just hate that

00:38:30,059 --> 00:38:36,150
assets of stuff that bought and sold

00:38:32,790 --> 00:38:38,579
their things you know it's just terrible

00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:40,890
you can't do that we are creative

00:38:38,579 --> 00:38:44,190
organizations that come together and

00:38:40,890 --> 00:38:45,420
work and we have to realize that this is

00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:49,349
the way things are now our

00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:51,839
organizational team is simply as all of

00:38:49,349 --> 00:38:54,990
us choosing to work together for a

00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:59,069
shared purpose now we covered this thing

00:38:54,990 --> 00:39:01,440
of shared purpose and a little earlier

00:38:59,069 --> 00:39:03,839
on but it is absolutely keely there has

00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:05,339
to be alignment if you got one person

00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:06,930
saying I want a fancy new house and

00:39:05,339 --> 00:39:07,950
that's all I care about and other people

00:39:06,930 --> 00:39:09,980
saying we want to build an organization

00:39:07,950 --> 00:39:12,839
we want to be part of for a long time

00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:14,730
things fail things fall down you have to

00:39:12,839 --> 00:39:18,299
get people together for that shared

00:39:14,730 --> 00:39:19,859
purpose and the choosing word is really

00:39:18,299 --> 00:39:21,390
important here too because it's

00:39:19,859 --> 00:39:26,160
something we have to come to terms with

00:39:21,390 --> 00:39:29,720
in our industry is that good talent can

00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:32,849
move anywhere at the drop of a hat

00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:35,220
people are choosing to work together and

00:39:32,849 --> 00:39:37,410
if you don't consider them in what

00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:39,180
you're doing in your organization if you

00:39:37,410 --> 00:39:41,970
don't put them at the heart of decisions

00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:44,549
if you don't work openly transparently

00:39:41,970 --> 00:39:49,320
collaboratively with them they will

00:39:44,549 --> 00:39:52,180
choose to do something else and they can

00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:55,210
that perimeter that I showed around the

00:39:52,180 --> 00:40:00,700
organization that circle that is not a

00:39:55,210 --> 00:40:04,930
wall that is not hard solid line it's

00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:07,420
not a line that cannot be crossed it's a

00:40:04,930 --> 00:40:09,490
dotted line it's temporary you've

00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:11,650
brought people together like magnetism

00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:14,320
to work on something that they believe

00:40:11,650 --> 00:40:16,720
in in a way that they believe in they

00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:19,869
can choose to be there and you can

00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:22,900
appreciate that or not and if you don't

00:40:19,869 --> 00:40:25,210
that circle changes shape and teams move

00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:26,890
elsewhere so that's really important

00:40:25,210 --> 00:40:31,570
that choosing word and that shared

00:40:26,890 --> 00:40:33,730
purpose word are absolutely key so in

00:40:31,570 --> 00:40:36,520
wrapping up what I want to say is there

00:40:33,730 --> 00:40:37,990
are sprints on Friday and there's a lot

00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:40,990
of things there that are code

00:40:37,990 --> 00:40:42,400
traditionally but it's not all code and

00:40:40,990 --> 00:40:44,410
if we're going to build this kind of

00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:45,850
shared purpose and healthy teams we a

00:40:44,410 --> 00:40:47,950
need to understand what's going on

00:40:45,850 --> 00:40:50,050
amongst all teams but we need people

00:40:47,950 --> 00:40:53,290
there who are interested in the way that

00:40:50,050 --> 00:40:55,000
teams work and working on those kind of

00:40:53,290 --> 00:40:57,040
issues how can we bring together people

00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:59,590
together around stuff how can we manage

00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:01,690
call contributions better or module

00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:03,850
development so even if you're not a

00:41:01,690 --> 00:41:05,590
coder there will be things that you can

00:41:03,850 --> 00:41:08,200
do at these Sprint's and it's really

00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:11,350
important to go to those the other thing

00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:14,590
to mention is and there's feedback on

00:41:11,350 --> 00:41:16,330
the sessions we want to know what you

00:41:14,590 --> 00:41:17,740
think of all of the sessions you go to

00:41:16,330 --> 00:41:19,960
it's really important for the drupal

00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:22,390
association to know what to schedule in

00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:24,670
beauty in future years and as this is

00:41:22,390 --> 00:41:26,920
the first year of this track the being

00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:28,510
human track we really want to know what

00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:30,550
you think of the sessions on this is

00:41:28,510 --> 00:41:34,600
this a useful track are you learning

00:41:30,550 --> 00:41:36,160
things to take away and if you want to

00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:38,530
follow us on twitter we're blogging

00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:40,900
about a lot of this as well as we have

00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:43,060
our journey from very small start-up

00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:44,590
we're blogging very transparent in

00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:46,660
opening and sharing a lot of these tools

00:41:44,590 --> 00:41:49,000
and i'll share some of these notes and

00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:52,600
slides as well so feel free to follow or

00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:55,660
on the blog or on twitter now it is

00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:57,790
half-past four there's 15 minutes left

00:41:55,660 --> 00:42:00,550
of the session we have an audience Q&A

00:41:57,790 --> 00:42:02,170
Mike I can't promise great answers to

00:42:00,550 --> 00:42:02,650
every question but we can have a

00:42:02,170 --> 00:42:04,780
discussion

00:42:02,650 --> 00:42:06,700
and we can see who has the great answers

00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:08,320
in the room because that's one of the

00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:10,390
key things that Center person doesn't

00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:12,730
have all the answers they just create

00:42:10,390 --> 00:42:15,490
the right structure the right place for

00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:17,140
the the magic to happen that's the key

00:42:15,490 --> 00:42:19,180
part of their job so consider me at the

00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:20,920
center of that circle for now creating

00:42:19,180 --> 00:42:22,840
the right space not providing all the

00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:23,890
answers so we have time some questions

00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:25,930
if you like to line up on this

00:42:23,890 --> 00:42:28,060
microphone here if you have questions

00:42:25,930 --> 00:42:32,170
you'd like to ask please feel free and

00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:34,210
we can put them out to the rim no I see

00:42:32,170 --> 00:42:37,480
if regarding openness and transparency

00:42:34,210 --> 00:42:40,030
what's your opinion about sharing wages

00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:41,680
what the staff urns and and how much

00:42:40,030 --> 00:42:44,620
people shouldn't should increase on a

00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:45,850
yearly basis decisions on their doing

00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:48,280
together with the staff what's your

00:42:45,850 --> 00:42:50,200
opinion about it yeah that's a great

00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:52,990
question because it comes down to real

00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:55,900
deep-seated cultural issues a lot the

00:42:52,990 --> 00:42:58,240
time and also different laws in

00:42:55,900 --> 00:43:01,330
different countries about opening up

00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:03,370
that data we've chosen to be very open

00:43:01,330 --> 00:43:05,680
with it and you know my team members

00:43:03,370 --> 00:43:09,040
know what I'm paid and what each other's

00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:11,530
paid and we like that openness but we're

00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:13,300
a relatively small team how it works

00:43:11,530 --> 00:43:15,730
when you scale up is a more difficult

00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:20,040
question I've seen salary certainly be a

00:43:15,730 --> 00:43:25,210
divisive issue before when it wasn't

00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:27,040
opened up at the right times so yeh can

00:43:25,210 --> 00:43:29,410
be I think with everything if you try

00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:31,240
and put a lid on things you know what's

00:43:29,410 --> 00:43:33,400
the reason we don't want people to know

00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:34,420
what what people are paid if your CEOs

00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:35,950
being paid something that he doesn't

00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:37,960
want the rest of the company to know

00:43:35,950 --> 00:43:40,690
about there should probably be alarm

00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:42,250
bells ringing there um but how do you do

00:43:40,690 --> 00:43:44,920
that because then how do you explain

00:43:42,250 --> 00:43:46,390
what the journey is up through pay and

00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:49,000
one of the things we've really got solve

00:43:46,390 --> 00:43:50,950
in our industry is how do you have

00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,990
career progression in very flat

00:43:50,950 --> 00:43:55,030
organizations and you've got to find

00:43:52,990 --> 00:43:56,890
other ways for people to be earning more

00:43:55,030 --> 00:43:58,540
and that's through their professional

00:43:56,890 --> 00:44:00,280
development so they can move on to

00:43:58,540 --> 00:44:02,950
higher day rates that's through more

00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:06,070
specialism through supporting teams in

00:44:02,950 --> 00:44:07,330
their specialism and but very often it's

00:44:06,070 --> 00:44:09,070
not about moving into management

00:44:07,330 --> 00:44:10,420
positions or leadership positions

00:44:09,070 --> 00:44:13,210
because they're not the right people for

00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:14,620
those all the time so how do you I think

00:44:13,210 --> 00:44:16,210
it's good to open it up because it then

00:44:14,620 --> 00:44:18,700
has forces that conversation

00:44:16,210 --> 00:44:20,530
how are we going to ensure people's

00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:22,720
professional development takes them up

00:44:20,530 --> 00:44:24,609
that pay scale without cramming them

00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:26,830
into jobs that they don't want to do and

00:44:24,609 --> 00:44:28,750
might not be right for and if you want

00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:30,820
to read more widely about this buffer is

00:44:28,750 --> 00:44:32,920
famous for having blogged about this

00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:35,170
very openly you know buffer the Twitter

00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:37,180
sharing app their blog is great if you

00:44:35,170 --> 00:44:39,070
search for buffer open salaries or

00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:41,230
something you'll find their blog post

00:44:39,070 --> 00:44:43,960
and they share everything and what they

00:44:41,230 --> 00:44:46,030
they have is a formula for the way that

00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:48,040
salaries are calculated so that it's

00:44:46,030 --> 00:44:50,770
very open and egalitarian for

00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:52,869
calculating and stuff but maybe you know

00:44:50,770 --> 00:44:54,940
you could take first step create that

00:44:52,869 --> 00:44:56,680
formula which is based on you know we

00:44:54,940 --> 00:44:58,660
will look at market salaries and we will

00:44:56,680 --> 00:45:02,050
wait based on experience and we'll wait

00:44:58,660 --> 00:45:04,599
based on day rate and so on that can be

00:45:02,050 --> 00:45:06,240
a key thing one of the key things I talk

00:45:04,599 --> 00:45:09,640
about some time is the rule of thirds

00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:12,310
it's like in restaurants when you buy a

00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:15,190
meal a third of what you pay for the

00:45:12,310 --> 00:45:16,690
food goes on actual ingredients a third

00:45:15,190 --> 00:45:18,550
is on the people that prepare it and

00:45:16,690 --> 00:45:20,230
bring it to your table and a third

00:45:18,550 --> 00:45:23,140
towards goes towards general overheads

00:45:20,230 --> 00:45:24,670
and profit so that rule of thirds is in

00:45:23,140 --> 00:45:26,680
the restaurant trade and it's a very you

00:45:24,670 --> 00:45:28,030
know well known thing but in our

00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:29,830
industry again you know it's roughly

00:45:28,030 --> 00:45:31,599
about a third that will go on the

00:45:29,830 --> 00:45:33,820
salaries a third of people's day rates

00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:35,320
goes on salaries of third goes into the

00:45:33,820 --> 00:45:37,180
organization professional development

00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:39,880
and all the tools and so on and a third

00:45:37,180 --> 00:45:41,770
to either overheads and profit so yeah

00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:43,510
you can open up a formula and then maybe

00:45:41,770 --> 00:45:45,550
that could be a step towards opening up

00:45:43,510 --> 00:45:48,339
more widely blind tend to be in favor of

00:45:45,550 --> 00:45:50,520
being pretty open about it okay next

00:45:48,339 --> 00:45:50,520
question

00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:58,200
hi it sounds good with the healthy and

00:45:55,650 --> 00:46:03,050
diverse team but doesn't it mean that

00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:05,820
you have to say no to talent that you

00:46:03,050 --> 00:46:07,680
that you can't bring on to the team if

00:46:05,820 --> 00:46:09,840
you want to maintain the health and you

00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:12,720
won't want to maintain the culture even

00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:16,470
though your talk about diversity I mean

00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:19,320
there's a clash or yeah there can be

00:46:16,470 --> 00:46:21,780
because talent isn't just about what you

00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:24,630
can do at the keyboard with code or

00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:26,849
design or report writing or sales pitch

00:46:24,630 --> 00:46:29,220
writing or whatever talent is kind of a

00:46:26,849 --> 00:46:31,470
deeper thing also encompasses your

00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:33,240
communication skills your ability to

00:46:31,470 --> 00:46:35,460
work in teams with others and so on and

00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:37,109
you have to recognize and bring on

00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:39,599
individuals that are right for that

00:46:37,109 --> 00:46:41,520
culture in your team and if they're not

00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:43,590
then you have to have that conversation

00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:45,210
and it may be that they leave themselves

00:46:43,590 --> 00:46:47,520
it may be that you have that

00:46:45,210 --> 00:46:50,340
conversation and you work out ways that

00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:52,080
they can try and fit in and if not move

00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:53,520
them out of the organization but yeah

00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:55,890
you will sometimes have to say no to

00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:58,050
talent I've had to do it really talented

00:46:55,890 --> 00:47:00,540
people who perhaps were very very

00:46:58,050 --> 00:47:03,000
lacking on the communication site and we

00:47:00,540 --> 00:47:05,040
primarily hire for communication skills

00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:07,020
there isn't a member of our team I

00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:10,349
wouldn't put solo in a meeting with the

00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:12,810
CEO of an enormous client that's so

00:47:10,349 --> 00:47:15,450
important to us because that ability to

00:47:12,810 --> 00:47:18,839
communicate with each other with clients

00:47:15,450 --> 00:47:21,540
and so on it makes a real difference so

00:47:18,839 --> 00:47:24,050
yeah you you have to find what is our

00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:27,270
kind of person but that is not about

00:47:24,050 --> 00:47:28,740
their genetic characteristics or

00:47:27,270 --> 00:47:31,710
anything it's not about their background

00:47:28,740 --> 00:47:34,230
or any of that it's about their skills

00:47:31,710 --> 00:47:36,540
and their fit with the culture so you

00:47:34,230 --> 00:47:39,330
choose on fit the culture and everybody

00:47:36,540 --> 00:47:43,020
has an equal opportunity to try and fit

00:47:39,330 --> 00:47:44,609
in with that culture but okay next

00:47:43,020 --> 00:47:46,349
question would you care to come through

00:47:44,609 --> 00:47:49,260
to the mic because it's good it's being

00:47:46,349 --> 00:47:51,089
recorded and is going to be put out

00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:52,950
later on so we've been asked to bring

00:47:51,089 --> 00:47:54,540
everyone up to this mic well I could go

00:47:52,950 --> 00:47:56,880
around jerry springer style I mean that

00:47:54,540 --> 00:47:59,140
kind of appeals if you don't track times

00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:02,980
how do you then see if a project runs

00:47:59,140 --> 00:48:05,470
of a budget okay so and if you're using

00:48:02,980 --> 00:48:07,300
agile then you're working in sprints and

00:48:05,470 --> 00:48:09,520
you know at the end of each spring helen

00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:12,430
is not a job well I'd get a different

00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:14,260
client so unless it's a very small

00:48:12,430 --> 00:48:16,750
project I mean there are certain small

00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:19,180
budget projects that it's fine not to

00:48:16,750 --> 00:48:21,010
use agile file but for larger projects i

00:48:19,180 --> 00:48:24,160
mean the UK government published a

00:48:21,010 --> 00:48:27,700
report yesterday one of their government

00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:30,130
agencies has adopted agile and in the

00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:31,600
last two years have delivered something

00:48:30,130 --> 00:48:33,400
like I'm trying off that on my head you

00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:35,710
think I think it's my eight successful

00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:39,100
live projects and the previous 10 years

00:48:35,710 --> 00:48:41,050
that delivered to that had succeeded and

00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:43,150
you know they've just seen this change

00:48:41,050 --> 00:48:45,580
momentum and transparency and visibility

00:48:43,150 --> 00:48:48,220
and it doesn't this have to be about all

00:48:45,580 --> 00:48:50,620
about just scrum let's not get religious

00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:52,710
about it but it's agile principles about

00:48:50,620 --> 00:48:55,330
openness transparency collaboration

00:48:52,710 --> 00:48:57,850
regular you know checkings regular

00:48:55,330 --> 00:49:01,900
planning rather than big planning big

00:48:57,850 --> 00:49:04,660
delivery big ah which tended to 25

00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:07,060
projects before okay but like could you

00:49:04,660 --> 00:49:08,470
like say an example you know I imagine

00:49:07,060 --> 00:49:09,850
you have a team of five people they all

00:49:08,470 --> 00:49:11,500
work remote you don't know what they're

00:49:09,850 --> 00:49:13,450
doing or what you see in spring board or

00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:14,920
whatever right yeah you don't know if

00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:17,110
they spend enough force on a toy eight

00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:18,610
hours on it and you know and our body

00:49:17,110 --> 00:49:20,260
isn't building in the end if you want to

00:49:18,610 --> 00:49:22,120
send a bill you need to somehow say okay

00:49:20,260 --> 00:49:23,950
we spent X hours on your project and

00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:26,500
here's your bill so what we do is we

00:49:23,950 --> 00:49:28,450
work in sprints and people are booked on

00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:30,250
two sprints when a project starting it

00:49:28,450 --> 00:49:31,920
might be so you know ten two weeks

00:49:30,250 --> 00:49:34,300
prints or something for a team of five

00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:36,490
and at the beginning that project you're

00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:38,320
agreeing the teams and their presence

00:49:36,490 --> 00:49:42,580
and so on and at the end of each sprint

00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:44,680
all it is is person days and so it's a

00:49:42,580 --> 00:49:47,140
much loose way if you've got a very

00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:48,730
short project hourly is probably going

00:49:47,140 --> 00:49:50,620
to be what you have to do but for

00:49:48,730 --> 00:49:53,350
anything bigger we encourage this move

00:49:50,620 --> 00:49:56,290
towards sprint thinking and at the very

00:49:53,350 --> 00:49:58,270
least person days and all that matters

00:49:56,290 --> 00:50:00,370
is someone was booked on something it's

00:49:58,270 --> 00:50:02,290
you know it's not something where the

00:50:00,370 --> 00:50:03,730
client suddenly says oh yeah yeah

00:50:02,290 --> 00:50:05,410
marketing department haven't got the

00:50:03,730 --> 00:50:06,730
brand guidelines yet you'll have to send

00:50:05,410 --> 00:50:09,369
your design guy home

00:50:06,730 --> 00:50:11,740
that guy's booked and needs to be booked

00:50:09,369 --> 00:50:13,869
on something else you know or you know

00:50:11,740 --> 00:50:15,190
the API documentation is ready your

00:50:13,869 --> 00:50:17,859
develop I have to go home and she can

00:50:15,190 --> 00:50:19,750
come back tomorrow that doesn't work you

00:50:17,859 --> 00:50:23,670
can't do that kind of thing because you

00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:26,080
have a team approach so that kind of

00:50:23,670 --> 00:50:27,970
agile process that kind of sprint base

00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:30,280
really helps you get out of that hourly

00:50:27,970 --> 00:50:32,230
culture which is punishing for everybody

00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:34,270
and doesn't deliver real value and you

00:50:32,230 --> 00:50:36,310
monitor progress instead through the

00:50:34,270 --> 00:50:37,600
delivery of story points and in fact

00:50:36,310 --> 00:50:39,220
there's even a culture there's a really

00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:41,590
interesting thread if you look up hash

00:50:39,220 --> 00:50:43,390
no estimates and google it as well

00:50:41,590 --> 00:50:45,160
there's a site that supports the hashtag

00:50:43,390 --> 00:50:46,930
and there's a really interesting culture

00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:48,550
around it's a waste of time to estimate

00:50:46,930 --> 00:50:50,500
at all because you know it's always

00:50:48,550 --> 00:50:52,390
wrong isn't it because we're doing

00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:55,150
really complex stuff it's almost

00:50:52,390 --> 00:50:56,650
impossible to know the solution at the

00:50:55,150 --> 00:50:58,540
beginning the entire solution and how

00:50:56,650 --> 00:50:59,950
long it will take so recognize that and

00:50:58,540 --> 00:51:02,470
just try and get things to roughly the

00:50:59,950 --> 00:51:04,330
same size and study the number of things

00:51:02,470 --> 00:51:05,560
that go through the system but if

00:51:04,330 --> 00:51:07,480
otherwise for their different sized

00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:08,800
stories you can do rough story pointing

00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:11,260
and you can then look at the velocity

00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:12,760
that you deliver through a project and

00:51:11,260 --> 00:51:15,280
that helps get that team away from that

00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:19,270
curse of micromanagement than time

00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:20,580
tracking okay next question just

00:51:19,270 --> 00:51:23,740
wondered if you've got any sort of

00:51:20,580 --> 00:51:25,240
thoughts or advice for we're very small

00:51:23,740 --> 00:51:28,840
company for people we've just gone

00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:31,810
distributed and it's working pretty well

00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:33,700
with the communications all you know is

00:51:31,810 --> 00:51:34,619
kind of working well and everything and

00:51:33,700 --> 00:51:38,069
we're

00:51:34,619 --> 00:51:40,230
very pleased of it one sort of issue i'm

00:51:38,069 --> 00:51:43,349
looking for to the future is taking on

00:51:40,230 --> 00:51:45,539
new members of staff now we're not we're

00:51:43,349 --> 00:51:47,400
not a particularly wealthy company so

00:51:45,539 --> 00:51:48,690
you know we're not going to be we're not

00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:51,599
going to be in a position type sort of

00:51:48,690 --> 00:51:53,249
higher venues or anything so if i was to

00:51:51,599 --> 00:51:54,329
take on an experienced member of stuff i

00:51:53,249 --> 00:51:55,410
don't think that would be too much of a

00:51:54,329 --> 00:51:57,390
problem because they might have worked

00:51:55,410 --> 00:51:58,799
distributed before you know you might

00:51:57,390 --> 00:52:00,359
have a couple of face-to-face meetings

00:51:58,799 --> 00:52:03,359
with them in a cafe and then the way

00:52:00,359 --> 00:52:06,599
they go but what about somebody in

00:52:03,359 --> 00:52:08,700
experienced or a junior or you know are

00:52:06,599 --> 00:52:11,759
there any anything I could possibly do

00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:13,980
mmm I'm it's a challenge that all

00:52:11,759 --> 00:52:15,749
distributed teams face and in fact it's

00:52:13,980 --> 00:52:17,309
even a problem in other organizations

00:52:15,749 --> 00:52:19,049
because you know even if you're in the

00:52:17,309 --> 00:52:21,299
same office people are busy they've got

00:52:19,049 --> 00:52:22,890
their own jobs to do so bring in junior

00:52:21,299 --> 00:52:25,650
staff is something that's often done

00:52:22,890 --> 00:52:27,359
very badly in our industry it's kind of

00:52:25,650 --> 00:52:29,999
like yo here's your induction day grub

00:52:27,359 --> 00:52:32,490
do this good do that you know here's an

00:52:29,999 --> 00:52:35,160
email and go to lunch with them done

00:52:32,490 --> 00:52:37,650
yeah that kind of thing and we really

00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:40,619
need to look at better onboarding for

00:52:37,650 --> 00:52:42,569
particularly junior staff and but if you

00:52:40,619 --> 00:52:45,239
doing that in a distributed environment

00:52:42,569 --> 00:52:47,579
I think the face-to-face time is so

00:52:45,239 --> 00:52:49,769
valuable to those who are new and young

00:52:47,579 --> 00:52:51,150
in the industry and so it could be a

00:52:49,769 --> 00:52:53,099
question just pairing them up with

00:52:51,150 --> 00:52:55,079
someone who lives not too far away and

00:52:53,099 --> 00:52:57,799
maybe that pair could meet up in a cafe

00:52:55,079 --> 00:53:01,769
two days a week for the first few weeks

00:52:57,799 --> 00:53:04,499
what can you do there and also maybe a

00:53:01,769 --> 00:53:06,450
few of you could meet up once a month or

00:53:04,499 --> 00:53:09,180
something and just support them through

00:53:06,450 --> 00:53:10,980
that and otherwise the next best

00:53:09,180 --> 00:53:12,989
fullback is have someone just have a

00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:14,369
daily 15-minute hanging out with them

00:53:12,989 --> 00:53:16,019
how you're doing what you're doing there

00:53:14,369 --> 00:53:17,849
and checking in with them on chat

00:53:16,019 --> 00:53:19,829
regularly you just need to be very

00:53:17,849 --> 00:53:22,859
present very active so they're not

00:53:19,829 --> 00:53:25,230
sitting there at home going hmm nobody's

00:53:22,859 --> 00:53:26,460
talking to me what do I do next I don't

00:53:25,230 --> 00:53:28,980
want to make fool of myself by saying

00:53:26,460 --> 00:53:30,509
something in the chat Oh what do I do so

00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:32,609
you've got to really support them

00:53:30,509 --> 00:53:35,009
through it because they it would be very

00:53:32,609 --> 00:53:36,839
stressful for them so do it remotely or

00:53:35,009 --> 00:53:39,029
in person however you can but do it very

00:53:36,839 --> 00:53:40,619
mindful II think of what are they

00:53:39,029 --> 00:53:41,280
thinking now what might they be worrying

00:53:40,619 --> 00:53:43,440
about how

00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:44,790
we help them through that there's no

00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:47,340
perfect answer I'm afraid remember that

00:53:44,790 --> 00:53:51,810
slide with perfection cross out there

00:53:47,340 --> 00:53:54,270
you go thanks for a great session we're

00:53:51,810 --> 00:53:57,090
in norwegian company with eight eight

00:53:54,270 --> 00:53:59,160
nine people and we're looking to grow to

00:53:57,090 --> 00:54:03,330
the double size within the 23 couple of

00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:05,160
years could you just elaborate on where

00:54:03,330 --> 00:54:08,400
you were when you started this process

00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:10,020
and where you're now and where you going

00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:12,660
in terms of scaling and how you're gonna

00:54:10,020 --> 00:54:14,970
do that sure yeah we're pretty young

00:54:12,660 --> 00:54:17,070
company and we'd come out of a very

00:54:14,970 --> 00:54:19,200
difficult situation but the team you

00:54:17,070 --> 00:54:21,150
know and had gone off in different you

00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:26,280
know come from all sorts of different

00:54:21,150 --> 00:54:28,620
directions but decided to link up and so

00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:29,910
we started non day one we blogged so you

00:54:28,620 --> 00:54:32,610
can look at our blog and just think what

00:54:29,910 --> 00:54:34,560
we were thinking day one and we wrote

00:54:32,610 --> 00:54:36,930
about that kind of stuff and we're

00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:39,180
sharing weekly throughout throughout the

00:54:36,930 --> 00:54:43,230
process so we've got to the stage now

00:54:39,180 --> 00:54:45,660
where there's seven of us and we work

00:54:43,230 --> 00:54:47,670
together regularly we're on you know few

00:54:45,660 --> 00:54:49,440
of us on different projects and so on so

00:54:47,670 --> 00:54:52,170
we have to work to actively keep that

00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:54,810
cohesion even on such a small team when

00:54:52,170 --> 00:54:57,690
it's distributed and we're great not

00:54:54,810 --> 00:55:00,030
going for huge growth what we're doing

00:54:57,690 --> 00:55:02,550
is partnering with other agencies to

00:55:00,030 --> 00:55:04,710
deliver larger projects and a bit that

00:55:02,550 --> 00:55:06,990
we specialize in is the kind of the

00:55:04,710 --> 00:55:08,760
consultancy and the project guidance

00:55:06,990 --> 00:55:10,920
through a process sort of a program

00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:13,560
management approach and we support a

00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:15,690
small team of other agencies to deliver

00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:18,270
very big projects like that by providing

00:55:15,690 --> 00:55:20,490
that wrapper that allows them to work

00:55:18,270 --> 00:55:22,260
with enterprise clients we're very

00:55:20,490 --> 00:55:24,180
selective about those partners that we

00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:26,580
take on so we know they can deliver

00:55:24,180 --> 00:55:28,650
those projects so we would rather than

00:55:26,580 --> 00:55:30,120
growing really big what we're seeking to

00:55:28,650 --> 00:55:32,100
do is get the best in the industry so

00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:34,680
rather be a supermarket we're a group of

00:55:32,100 --> 00:55:36,480
local independent traders who are owned

00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:38,490
and managed a passionate about what they

00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:40,380
do have well trained well supported

00:55:38,490 --> 00:55:42,480
staff and so on and that's kind of a

00:55:40,380 --> 00:55:44,910
different approach that we're taking now

00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:46,740
but yeah that growth is hard you'll find

00:55:44,910 --> 00:55:49,410
that getting into double digits is a

00:55:46,740 --> 00:55:50,520
really tough phase and then the next

00:55:49,410 --> 00:55:51,310
thing you'll hit is somewhere around

00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:52,990
about 30

00:55:51,310 --> 00:55:54,900
and we've said we probably don't want to

00:55:52,990 --> 00:55:57,130
grow beyond about 25 or 30 people

00:55:54,900 --> 00:55:58,660
because that's the you know that makes

00:55:57,130 --> 00:56:01,180
it easy to just get together regularly

00:55:58,660 --> 00:56:03,490
and do things regularly and you know

00:56:01,180 --> 00:56:05,620
great when you're at that 11 if you

00:56:03,490 --> 00:56:06,970
decide not to grow beyond that what you

00:56:05,620 --> 00:56:09,250
do is you look for the higher value

00:56:06,970 --> 00:56:11,470
product projects you look for the better

00:56:09,250 --> 00:56:13,050
clients you get more selective and you

00:56:11,470 --> 00:56:15,010
put some limit on the organization

00:56:13,050 --> 00:56:18,640
that's a good thing from our child as

00:56:15,010 --> 00:56:20,820
well you've got the concept in a Kanban

00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:23,290
and so on of this work-in-progress limit

00:56:20,820 --> 00:56:25,090
and that's really really helpful in

00:56:23,290 --> 00:56:27,100
delivering projects it's also really

00:56:25,090 --> 00:56:29,020
really helpful in delivering successful

00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:31,570
organizations you look for the highest

00:56:29,020 --> 00:56:33,550
value thing to do all the time the best

00:56:31,570 --> 00:56:35,650
client to work with you don't just take

00:56:33,550 --> 00:56:37,630
on every project you can get to grow

00:56:35,650 --> 00:56:39,340
bigger and I think it's important to be

00:56:37,630 --> 00:56:40,840
to think about what direction do you

00:56:39,340 --> 00:56:42,580
want to go do you want to be really big

00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:45,130
or do you want to be kind of owned and

00:56:42,580 --> 00:56:46,930
managed a real team feeling and consider

00:56:45,130 --> 00:56:50,890
what the culture is that you want to

00:56:46,930 --> 00:56:53,260
maintain but always I favor higher value

00:56:50,890 --> 00:56:55,240
go for the higher day rates go for the

00:56:53,260 --> 00:56:59,230
projects that are more fun more exciting

00:56:55,240 --> 00:57:01,030
be selective or reject most rfps one of

00:56:59,230 --> 00:57:03,220
my colleagues yesterday and one of our

00:57:01,030 --> 00:57:04,750
overheard at convivio things was these

00:57:03,220 --> 00:57:07,810
rfps we're going to need to get a bigger

00:57:04,750 --> 00:57:10,000
bin because we're really selective and

00:57:07,810 --> 00:57:12,340
there's some really bad RFP is out there

00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:13,810
that we get sent and so on so you've

00:57:12,340 --> 00:57:15,250
just got when you're small you can

00:57:13,810 --> 00:57:16,810
afford to be really selective and just

00:57:15,250 --> 00:57:19,360
take on things that are absolutely

00:57:16,810 --> 00:57:21,340
remember the three points of focus once

00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:22,810
you've got that figured out you know you

00:57:21,340 --> 00:57:24,550
can reject anything that isn't at the

00:57:22,810 --> 00:57:28,720
triangulation of those and that will

00:57:24,550 --> 00:57:31,210
define your organization saying no will

00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:33,370
define what your team is like and what

00:57:31,210 --> 00:57:36,700
your organization is like that no is

00:57:33,370 --> 00:57:38,350
very very powerful okay thank you very

00:57:36,700 --> 00:57:40,630
