Title: DrupalCon Dublin 2016: Bridging the PhoneGap: Getting Started Creating Hybrid Mobile Apps
Publication date: 2016-09-27
Playlist: DrupalCon Dublin 2016
Description: 
	You are a Drupal developer. You are a frontend developer. You like PHP and CSS and HTML and JavaScript and since Drupal 8 is here, you like Twig (though we won't be talking Twig in this session!). You have an idea for an app, but you don't have the time to learn Swift and Objective C and Java and ...

With the advent of hybrid mobile apps, you can continue being a Drupal frontend developer and also build apps without needing to learn new technologies. The mobile web is quickly catching up with native apps. The mobile web is free, and open, and available to all of us right now and doesn't bind us to proprietary systems. With the many advances being made in this area, we can create great mobile experiences for users.

In this session, we will look at three things:

Using Drupal as a RESTful web service to store app data
A brief introduction to Ionic Framework and AngularJS
How we can bridge Drupal and Ionic to create native look and feel hybrid web apps
Attendees will be excited to hear about this because they will learn a little about a lot of topics:

Hybrid App development (basically apps that can run on any operating system - all you need to know is HTML, CSS, and JS - or at least a willingness to learn them)
RESTful Drupal (don't want to build an app? We can use this knowledge to develop headless Drupal websites!)
AngularJS directives, controllers, services, and more (e.g. display a live feed of the weather in Dublin via Forecast.io)
Built-in features of Ionic Framework (JS and CSS components, custom directives, and how you can extend them)
Packaging apps for iOS and Android (and running them through an emulator)
Before attending this session, all you need is a positive and inquisitive mind (perhaps a little JavaScript knowledge as well). You don't need to know about how to create RESTful services (I'll show you), you don't need to understand AngularJS (we'll have a live demo of how easy it is), and you don't have to have built an app before.

Questions that often pop up when I give this talk:

Can it use push notifications? Yes
Can it use geo-location? Yes, yes
Can it use your phone's camera? As the last line in James Joyce's Ulysses says, 'yes, yes, yes'!
When this session is complete, you will

have the confidence to build a news-reader style app
be able to add content to any page of it
be able to update your app's content via your present Drupal website
see how to integrate external services into your app
chat with me over a nice pint of Guinness.
This session will be an expanded version of my talk at Frontend United in Ghent this year.

00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:15,960
hello welcome to drew pecan 10 16 and

00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:19,039
I'm i crack myself as a 2016 that's

00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:21,109
sweet had thousand years in the past and

00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:25,140
okay we're going to look today at

00:00:21,109 --> 00:00:29,060
getting started with ionic framework and

00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:32,880
Drupal for creating hybrid web apps and

00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:34,140
and it is a getting started this is an

00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,000
advanced tutorial it's hard even an

00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:38,520
intermediate tutorials it's it's the

00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,239
basic idea of how you create api's but

00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:43,649
with triple and then how you expose that

00:00:41,239 --> 00:00:44,850
information to an external service and

00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:47,579
how you use an external service to

00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:51,809
render a dis data and then how you

00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:54,690
package that up as an iOS app and or a

00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:56,010
an Android app my name is Mark

00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:58,170
honorarium lead front-end developer to

00:00:56,010 --> 00:01:00,329
an attack where ireland's leading Drupal

00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:01,980
agency basically if something happens in

00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:04,229
Ireland that's capital with Drupal you

00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:06,119
can be pretty sure that an attack have

00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:10,920
been involved if not been taking the

00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:13,710
lead on it and we're going to talk today

00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:15,930
about some background about myself let's

00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:19,619
say and the reason I decided I needed a

00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:20,610
nap what makes me a megalomaniac if you

00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:23,640
don't speak english as a first language

00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:25,799
that's Donald Trump basically we're

00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:27,780
going to look at Drupal as a RESTful API

00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:30,780
service and what you might do with that

00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:33,299
we have a brief look at what is ionic

00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:34,409
framework we've corrected me for not

00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:36,750
having a question mark at the end of

00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:38,820
that and i gotta stop bike shedding and

00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:40,079
we just get on with the information so i

00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:41,310
didn't put in a question mark then we

00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:43,229
look connecting the dots that means

00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:46,200
looking at how we connect drupal to

00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:47,729
ionic framework and used f10 to a to

00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:51,090
create our apps or create web apps or

00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:53,369
create some sort of a decoupled website

00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:55,620
based on drupal as a data store and they

00:01:53,369 --> 00:01:58,080
will have questions and answers

00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:59,430
I said go easy on me does for the first

00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:01,230
time I gave this presentation so you can

00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:02,430
go with it but harder now but still go

00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:05,610
easy on hits a getting started

00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:07,020
presentation so some background I

00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:09,090
decided to run as a candidate in the

00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:10,950
elections in Ireland about six maybe

00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:12,870
eight months ago we had elections at the

00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:14,220
national elections and i said i was

00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:18,810
going to be a candidate and i was going

00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:22,110
to get elected and i'm still working as

00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:24,890
a web developer so i told i had

00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:28,220
everything in place you know i had a

00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:30,240
poster campaign i'm gonna sort out

00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:33,390
who does someone I work right so when

00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:34,890
he's got a sword out I was about

00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:37,470
making Ireland great again it was just

00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:43,770
about certain stuff out don't I get a

00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:48,500
started at a Facebook page my wife tried

00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:48,500
to stop me so I ran over her in a tank

00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:56,060
you know she is actually as it happens

00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:59,910
but we'd sleep in separate rooms now

00:02:56,060 --> 00:03:02,220
it's tea from Pine two houses so we had

00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:04,260
some hashtags mark for king galway beast

00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:05,580
my constituency was go away east so i

00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:09,420
said we're going to be the goal with

00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:11,670
beasts and I thought her hashtag to go

00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:15,840
away beast as well one person retweeted

00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:18,750
one tweet once again the campaign wasn't

00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:22,020
going great it's good i had a job to

00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:27,300
follow back on I got an endorsement from

00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:29,250
a fellow megalomaniac don don Trump said

00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:32,489
there's only one credible candidate in

00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:34,739
go away east for general election 16 and

00:03:32,489 --> 00:03:37,290
that's markaana in that got lots of

00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:38,430
retweets and favorites so he's good for

00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:40,739
something you know he's good for someone

00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:42,120
else's branding or marketing and I got

00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:44,790
an endorsement from somebody that I

00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:46,560
never heard of before Hillary Clinton

00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:48,480
said that if Donald Trump is voting from

00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,760
our con rally and she's voting from our

00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:54,269
conroy that don't seem very many

00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:56,730
differing ideas um so that sounded

00:03:54,269 --> 00:03:59,370
fairly okay

00:03:56,730 --> 00:04:01,709
I decided under what I need is an app I

00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:03,540
want to make sure that if somebody is

00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:07,080
involved in the mark Conroy campaign

00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:08,849
data I can spam them you know that if

00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:11,610
they got a phone in their pocket I want

00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:13,980
to send my newsletters I want to send

00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:15,420
them text messages I want to send them

00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:16,919
push notifications I want to make sure

00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:19,019
that every single time to put out her

00:04:16,919 --> 00:04:20,970
phone to see me and that's going to get

00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:23,699
me elected if I don't have this kind of

00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:27,110
spanning infrastructure I'm not going to

00:04:23,699 --> 00:04:29,910
get elected so I said I'd build an app

00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:33,419
so that's basic background of why I was

00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:35,880
her what I was hoping to witness both

00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:37,410
win an election Todd okay Drupal is a

00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:39,110
perfect framework for me to build a

00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:41,340
content management system for this and

00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:42,990
not least because the only content

00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:47,039
management system that I understand how

00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:48,419
to use and so I was kind of stuck so we

00:04:47,039 --> 00:04:49,889
look at ropa we say it's a content

00:04:48,419 --> 00:04:53,280
management framework from we say we use

00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:55,229
this to create a lots of things one

00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,690
thing we use it mostly for us to create

00:04:55,229 --> 00:04:59,639
content management systems it can be

00:04:57,690 --> 00:05:01,800
used to and i put in a few blahblahblah

00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:03,300
as I've got a feeling if you got as far

00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:05,970
as drupalcon you got a fair idea what

00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:07,229
rupal is at least know it that kind of

00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:10,169
things that does so we skip these boring

00:05:07,229 --> 00:05:13,200
parts let's look at creating a RESTful

00:05:10,169 --> 00:05:14,010
API using Drupal there was another slide

00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:17,490
in this from when I gave this

00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:19,410
presentation a few months ago and it was

00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:21,210
how to do this with Drupal 7 as well a

00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:22,830
trooper 7 was quite complex you need

00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:24,150
maybe six or seven different modules and

00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:26,070
you kind of patch web services together

00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:28,229
and restful api to get her and different

00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:30,599
things and it wasn't difficult but it

00:05:28,229 --> 00:05:33,870
was more involved let's say in Drupal 8

00:05:30,599 --> 00:05:35,760
this is simple this is this I couldn't

00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:37,349
believe how simple this was when I when

00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:40,110
I try to do this you enable the

00:05:37,349 --> 00:05:42,510
serialization module you enable the

00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:43,560
restful webservices module and you

00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:46,169
probably should have some authentication

00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:47,520
now to create a prototype a poor very

00:05:46,169 --> 00:05:48,900
simple app for yourself just to say

00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,370
everything's work you don't need to

00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:52,320
authenticate it really but you should

00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:54,660
have some authentication and the HTTP

00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:56,340
basic authentication module comes in

00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:58,380
core after that then you're going to

00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:59,880
need to create some views to list the

00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:01,949
data that you want to consume in your

00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:03,720
app and my suggestion would be that you

00:06:01,949 --> 00:06:05,280
create a view to list all the listing

00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:07,140
pages you'll need so in my case I need

00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,320
one for my press releases one for my

00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:11,560
news one

00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:13,210
I campaigns I was involved in things

00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:14,470
like that I should probably mention here

00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:19,720
I didn't actually run the election dubs

00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:22,360
that's just a backstory and then I would

00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:24,430
say maybe create one view that lists

00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:29,020
every node on your website where a part

00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:31,660
of example.com / note / node ID / JSON

00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:33,310
or / feed or something whatever you want

00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:35,560
you want to call it so then you have all

00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:38,530
your lists and all of your nodes

00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:40,000
individualized as as JSON entities now

00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:42,160
to do this you get these three modules

00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,660
HTTP basic authentication restful web

00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:47,230
services and civilization and you click

00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:48,640
install it is as simple as that to get

00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:50,590
the infrastructure that you're going to

00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:53,680
need to create a restful api with Drupal

00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:54,880
8 then you create a view so normally

00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,500
when we create use we got two options

00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,900
you want to create a page or you want to

00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:00,370
create a block in this instance when you

00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:02,290
enable these modules you get a third

00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:05,920
option and that is to create a rest

00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:07,990
export view so you take your little box

00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:10,210
to say yes provide a rest export and

00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:13,740
then you enter a path for this so if you

00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:16,120
have example I come / articles as your

00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:17,830
your your listing page for your articles

00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:20,110
then you can have example.com such

00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:22,180
articles last JSON or XML or whatever

00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:24,580
path you want and that will give you the

00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:26,860
exact same list except with a in a JSON

00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:28,360
output click save and edit and you get

00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:30,820
to your view page and then you can

00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:32,620
choose here and the format will be

00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:34,030
serializer and the settings you can

00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:35,230
leave this as default if you leave it as

00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:38,020
default it will automatically create

00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:39,580
JSON feed and an XML feed if you don't

00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:42,220
leave it as default you choose which you

00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:44,440
want JSON or XML I'm not sure about but

00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:47,820
other formats and so if you leave that

00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:50,410
blank and touch just don't touch it and

00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:51,760
you can click Save and you will start

00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:52,720
getting data actually you will need one

00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,980
thing you need to add the fields that

00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,210
you need so you're going to need to add

00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:56,710
your title field your body feed your

00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:57,910
image field you might add the image

00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:59,670
field three or four different times

00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:01,690
because you might want it with different

00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:02,980
different image settings so you might

00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:04,240
have square image and a long image and a

00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:06,850
short image and these are image and

00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:08,230
things like that and and then whatever

00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:10,240
filter criteria you need and then you

00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:12,160
get some uglify json now depending on

00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,510
your PHP setup and your Apache setups

00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:16,080
and things like that you can have that

00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:18,520
printing a bit better so that is there

00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:20,980
that's listing all articles inside a

00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:25,780
JSON array with each article being an

00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:26,950
object so with that we've got restful

00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:29,260
doubt and that's that's it that's it

00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:31,030
that's a that's a restful api in drupal

00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:33,460
8 it's it's that easy so your navel

00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:35,500
modules takes 15-20 seconds you create a

00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:37,780
view it takes maybe one minute and

00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:40,060
you're ready to at least get started or

00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:42,610
start prototyping so we can consume to

00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:44,470
start it and anyway we want we can

00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:46,089
create a headless triple website so you

00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:48,040
you have your information in one place

00:08:46,089 --> 00:08:51,700
and you've got your your presentation in

00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:53,530
another place and we can create it as a

00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:56,650
canonical source of information so you

00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:57,700
might have a large website it has all of

00:08:56,650 --> 00:08:59,650
your news which might have some sub

00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:01,060
sites and these sub sites just promote

00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:02,050
the news thats related to droop account

00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:03,610
so you might have a troop accounts

00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:05,290
website for yourselves and dissing you

00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:06,490
can filter it out and not have to

00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:08,650
install the whole of drupal and not have

00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:10,150
to have the whole database and stuff

00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:13,360
that goes with that just have a

00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:16,900
front-end that uses the drupal data and

00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:20,050
is pulled in via react or angular or

00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:21,460
ember and I think Amber's probably what

00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:23,589
we should be looking towards I've got a

00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:25,839
feeling that that's going to be flavor

00:09:23,589 --> 00:09:29,950
of the month when Therese makes his

00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:32,050
decision and you can use it create

00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:33,580
differentiate a great editor experience

00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:35,620
from a great front end experience so you

00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:38,020
can you can let their back Enders and

00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:40,990
maybe from tenders focus on here is a

00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:43,540
beautiful editing experience for your

00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:45,550
website that we don't have the big long

00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:47,770
boring forms that we have presently from

00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:49,570
the seven-team we can have a really nice

00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:51,850
back-end team and then you have a really

00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:53,560
nice front end theme or as a really nice

00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:55,150
front end that's that's independent of

00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:57,100
trooper because it's a headless site

00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:59,410
basically or you can pull the

00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:00,760
information into your app and consume it

00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:01,660
that way and that's that's the goal

00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,800
today so there's there's lots of

00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:06,910
different things you can do once you

00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:08,470
have your data in this in this manner so

00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:10,780
let's have a quick look at what is ionic

00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:11,860
framework ionic framework the first

00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:13,180
thing dimension I suppose that it

00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:15,250
doesn't say it here is that it's free

00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:17,620
and open source so I think it's very

00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:18,700
good to have that if you're using you

00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:20,100
know free open-source software like

00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:22,170
drupal and

00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:25,589
it's going to try work whatever for you

00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:27,300
and open-source products it's a hybrid

00:10:25,589 --> 00:10:30,300
web app development kit that means it

00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:31,529
makes more than just the app that you

00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,819
might be developing first or you might

00:10:31,529 --> 00:10:36,000
be developing an iOS app well it's

00:10:32,819 --> 00:10:39,389
hybrid or make iOS and Android ionic one

00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,190
does not make windows apps but ionic 2

00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:42,839
does and the beta version of it

00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:44,399
presently does and it's I'd say in the

00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:46,980
next week we're going to be released as

00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:49,850
a full stable ionic 2 that will make

00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:52,740
their will build Windows apps for you

00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:56,100
what you do really is you use the open

00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:57,540
web standards and technologies that we

00:10:56,100 --> 00:11:00,810
all know and love and that is basically

00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:03,180
HTML CSS and JavaScript and you don't

00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:04,529
need to worry about lots of really fancy

00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:06,240
stuff and you don't need to worry about

00:11:04,529 --> 00:11:08,550
the wall gardens of using Swift or use

00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:12,079
an objective C or using Java and long

00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:14,610
times for Android and run times for for

00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:16,949
iOS you're busy building a little

00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:19,110
website that uses HTML CSS and

00:11:16,949 --> 00:11:22,500
JavaScript that we can all know and love

00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:23,910
and this will let us then create web

00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:25,589
apps basically and the web app then gets

00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:26,939
packaged up into a web view and that web

00:11:25,589 --> 00:11:29,699
view is what's used and inside the

00:11:26,939 --> 00:11:33,060
inside the Android or I on Android or

00:11:29,699 --> 00:11:34,829
iOS device if you want to create mac

00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:37,410
apps so if you want to create an iOS you

00:11:34,829 --> 00:11:38,850
you do need to have a Mac computer the

00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:44,430
reason being that when you when you

00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:46,439
package your app it packages and what's

00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:48,120
the format for xcode is a tech squad or

00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:49,319
whatever it is it packed is that and

00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:51,180
then you need Xcode which is only

00:11:49,319 --> 00:11:53,279
available on Mac computers you need exco

00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:55,470
to actually package that into the iOS

00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:57,420
app for you and so if you're on a Linux

00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:59,040
machine you will only be able to you can

00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:00,540
develop the hybrid app but you need to

00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:03,600
get a friend that has a mac computer to

00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:06,529
package it the I us / to refer you you

00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:09,240
can only do the Android apart and and

00:12:06,529 --> 00:12:11,579
yeah that's that page I suppose it comes

00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:13,889
with lots of built-in features so if

00:12:11,579 --> 00:12:17,399
you're used to framework likes a Twitter

00:12:13,889 --> 00:12:19,500
bootstrap are a foundation you know how

00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:21,120
to create menus and give them menu

00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:22,110
classes and by just adding all the

00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,509
different classes you want into your

00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:26,189
HTML you get you get your Jumbotron you

00:12:24,509 --> 00:12:27,839
get your slider you get your drop-down

00:12:26,189 --> 00:12:30,420
menus and things like that it comes with

00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:32,259
all those kinds of things built into it

00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:34,779
that you might need for

00:12:32,259 --> 00:12:36,819
apps such as your class call card and a

00:12:34,779 --> 00:12:38,319
class call list and these kind of things

00:12:36,819 --> 00:12:40,059
and these automatically build in the

00:12:38,319 --> 00:12:43,029
front end that looks like a material

00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:45,509
design type front end and it comes with

00:12:43,029 --> 00:12:47,889
supports for SAS so you can very easily

00:12:45,509 --> 00:12:49,449
not write CSS you can write SAS and you

00:12:47,889 --> 00:12:51,309
can recompile it and it has live reload

00:12:49,449 --> 00:12:54,369
and things like that once once you type

00:12:51,309 --> 00:12:56,199
ionic serve in to your terminal it every

00:12:54,369 --> 00:12:57,699
page every javascript file like it's

00:12:56,199 --> 00:12:59,769
changed every HTML file gets changed

00:12:57,699 --> 00:13:01,479
every CSS file every satisfied exchange

00:12:59,769 --> 00:13:02,799
automatically live real able to throw

00:13:01,479 --> 00:13:06,579
you and you can you can watch it in your

00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:09,129
browser and so that's an overview of the

00:13:06,579 --> 00:13:11,439
of the built-in features page from ionic

00:13:09,129 --> 00:13:12,549
framework calm there's a couple of

00:13:11,439 --> 00:13:15,929
websites you could look at ionic

00:13:12,549 --> 00:13:19,209
framework calm is is will say drupal.org

00:13:15,929 --> 00:13:20,679
ionic do is google com in terms of its

00:13:19,209 --> 00:13:22,449
the marketing side of it and then

00:13:20,679 --> 00:13:24,399
there's one called create organic do

00:13:22,449 --> 00:13:26,289
which allows you to have a drag-and-drop

00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:27,579
interface or prototype what the app

00:13:26,289 --> 00:13:29,499
might be like and you can package it up

00:13:27,579 --> 00:13:32,189
and then download that and use that as

00:13:29,499 --> 00:13:34,569
your as your starting starting a place

00:13:32,189 --> 00:13:38,799
so if for an example you're going to

00:13:34,569 --> 00:13:41,079
create a list usually it's as simple

00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:42,939
here as you can see you can find a CSS

00:13:41,079 --> 00:13:45,399
class components on the ionic framework

00:13:42,939 --> 00:13:48,309
website and you need to class for a list

00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:49,689
one is list and that automatic says then

00:13:48,309 --> 00:13:52,509
it is a list and it gives it whatever

00:13:49,689 --> 00:13:54,579
margins and padding's and you would

00:13:52,509 --> 00:13:56,230
expect on a list item and then the class

00:13:54,579 --> 00:13:58,089
card and Kara daughter Maggie then puts

00:13:56,230 --> 00:14:00,160
it in little davis with border shadows

00:13:58,089 --> 00:14:01,899
and things like that the same thing you

00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:04,660
can see later on you've got a hit ref

00:14:01,899 --> 00:14:06,459
and the classes item item icon left you

00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:08,019
say item icon left automatically the

00:14:06,459 --> 00:14:14,799
icon that stair comes in on the left and

00:14:08,019 --> 00:14:16,089
in the ID end at an icon element the

00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:17,409
same as if you use font awesome or

00:14:16,089 --> 00:14:19,539
something but it has what's called iono

00:14:17,409 --> 00:14:22,449
cons so these are icons built by ionic

00:14:19,539 --> 00:14:24,339
guys so here we got an icon and it's I

00:14:22,449 --> 00:14:25,179
on homes it's the Home icon and the same

00:14:24,339 --> 00:14:26,409
then you can see on the next one is

00:14:25,179 --> 00:14:28,859
telephone the next one is Wi-Fi and the

00:14:26,409 --> 00:14:31,389
next one is current for credit card so

00:14:28,859 --> 00:14:33,249
without knowing how to create all these

00:14:31,389 --> 00:14:36,249
apps not only much HTML and things like

00:14:33,249 --> 00:14:38,559
that you can just use these cards use

00:14:36,249 --> 00:14:40,059
these are easy classes to get a look and

00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:41,439
feel of it of a native app and then you

00:14:40,059 --> 00:14:43,290
can change.just or colors yourself to

00:14:41,439 --> 00:14:45,389
make it look and feel like you're you're

00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:48,420
branding colors or you can go for you

00:14:45,389 --> 00:14:50,089
know the full on experience of your skin

00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:52,110
the whole thing from start to finish and

00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:54,240
send them a JavaScript if you go to the

00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:56,329
JavaScript section of ionic framework

00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,019
calm you can see all the different

00:14:56,329 --> 00:15:00,870
interaction features that will be

00:14:58,019 --> 00:15:02,759
available to you so if if you want a

00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:05,310
feature such as modal so you want you

00:15:02,759 --> 00:15:07,819
click on login button and you want to

00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:10,949
pop up in a form not to go to a new page

00:15:07,819 --> 00:15:14,250
well that's very very simple to do so

00:15:10,949 --> 00:15:15,750
you find the service that would be

00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:17,519
needed and in this case here it's called

00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:19,290
ionic modal and you can see here then

00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:22,230
that we've got an angular module called

00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:23,579
test app it's got a controller called my

00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:25,889
controllers that the controller is going

00:15:23,579 --> 00:15:27,750
to go to determine what functionality is

00:15:25,889 --> 00:15:29,160
available when this controller is called

00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:31,940
on a page and in this case we've

00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:35,459
injected scope and injected ionic modal

00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:38,130
into the into the parameters after of my

00:15:35,459 --> 00:15:39,269
controller so that's just the basic

00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:41,160
dependency injection thing that every

00:15:39,269 --> 00:15:42,420
time this gets loaded diskettes this

00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,589
gets used and that's how easy it is to

00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:44,970
add new features so if you want to add

00:15:43,589 --> 00:15:47,930
in geolocation you want to add and push

00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:51,240
notifications or you want to add in and

00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:53,430
something else that's that's kind of as

00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:54,930
easy as it is so if we're going to

00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:57,060
create a basic app sort of the very

00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:59,279
first app we're gonna create you've

00:15:57,060 --> 00:16:00,990
installed node and you've installed goat

00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:02,699
and whatever you need that goes it goes

00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:05,459
along with it I will talk about those

00:16:02,699 --> 00:16:08,430
but in your terminal then you run this

00:16:05,459 --> 00:16:09,660
command ionic start and then you give

00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:12,060
the app a name and then you say the

00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:14,519
style of the app you want so you can say

00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:16,529
our next arrow click on blank or ionic

00:16:14,519 --> 00:16:18,839
starrett rubicon tabs or ionic start

00:16:16,529 --> 00:16:20,279
rubicon side menu and depending on which

00:16:18,839 --> 00:16:24,060
style you want to get a different set of

00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:25,350
files to show you or to pre-build what

00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:27,449
the shell of the website or what the

00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:28,620
shell of the app is going to be like so

00:16:27,449 --> 00:16:30,149
if you choose blank you get a blank

00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:31,800
slate you stare start from scratch if

00:16:30,149 --> 00:16:33,630
you choose tabs you get what you see

00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:35,430
here on the left and if you choose side

00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:37,170
menu you get what you see on there on

00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:38,490
the right so if you look at on the left

00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:41,279
at the bottom of the screen you can see

00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:43,350
there's a status button and use a chat

00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:45,449
tab and there's an account tab for

00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:46,980
settings so that's where the tabs go and

00:16:45,449 --> 00:16:48,750
then you can change them if you want for

00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:50,130
iOS you might say you want the tabs on

00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:53,490
the bottom and for Android you might say

00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:55,199
you want the tabs on the top and if you

00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:56,889
choose side menu you can see the stuffer

00:16:55,199 --> 00:17:00,069
says reggae chill dubstep in

00:16:56,889 --> 00:17:02,709
rap and cowbell dasa default playlist

00:17:00,069 --> 00:17:04,209
list that comes with ionic if you choose

00:17:02,709 --> 00:17:06,429
side menu and then if you click the

00:17:04,209 --> 00:17:07,510
hamburger the left slides across and you

00:17:06,429 --> 00:17:10,809
can see there that you get a login

00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:13,689
search browse and playlists menu items

00:17:10,809 --> 00:17:15,549
so if we were to look down at the

00:17:13,689 --> 00:17:18,250
directory in a file structure of ionic

00:17:15,549 --> 00:17:19,839
on the left-hand side and it's a side

00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:21,760
menu at that we're creating here for

00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:23,559
getting started tutorial you've got a

00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:27,189
few directories hooks platforms plugins

00:17:23,559 --> 00:17:28,899
s ESS www and some files you can ignore

00:17:27,189 --> 00:17:30,460
everything in there that's all ionic

00:17:28,899 --> 00:17:32,110
stuff and you were not interested in it

00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:33,429
except you might want to look to see how

00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:35,860
it actually works let's say but you

00:17:33,429 --> 00:17:37,899
don't need to interfere with those the

00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:40,240
only directory we're interested in is

00:17:37,899 --> 00:17:42,340
the www once that's our actual web app

00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,630
so if we look inside a web app then it's

00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:45,850
fairly easy to understand the structure

00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:48,190
there's a CSS directory and images

00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:51,190
directory a JavaScript directory library

00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:52,720
of helper functions and things that come

00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:55,389
with ionic and then a templates

00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:56,919
directory and I would change this

00:17:55,389 --> 00:17:58,630
structure around if I were you I'd go

00:17:56,919 --> 00:18:01,870
for the more component based approach

00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:04,690
and if you got a home page let's say I

00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:06,730
would create a home directory and inside

00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:08,799
I have a j/s directory so that my home J

00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:10,570
yes I have my home that s CSS from my

00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:14,950
sass and I have my home that HTML for my

00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:16,659
home page and HTML so that you keep each

00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:18,789
component in its own kind of modular

00:18:16,659 --> 00:18:20,260
modular place rather than all the

00:18:18,789 --> 00:18:21,789
JavaScript's in one file and all the CSS

00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:24,970
in one file and all the templates in 15

00:18:21,789 --> 00:18:26,919
because they could get a bit and a bit

00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:30,519
messy or a bit kind of hard to remember

00:18:26,919 --> 00:18:32,590
what goes where and ok so we're add a

00:18:30,519 --> 00:18:34,029
new page to our app so what we have back

00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:35,289
there was that's what you get default

00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:38,889
with the home page to add a new page

00:18:35,289 --> 00:18:40,779
then you go to www for you go to your JS

00:18:38,889 --> 00:18:43,389
folder and then you go to the apt at GS

00:18:40,779 --> 00:18:44,919
and file now like I said a moment ago I

00:18:43,389 --> 00:18:47,080
would have a home that is here and I'd

00:18:44,919 --> 00:18:49,149
have a news that is a news item jes and

00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:50,769
things like that but what comes is just

00:18:49,149 --> 00:18:53,470
an app that yes and all the app store

00:18:50,769 --> 00:18:56,880
gets lumped in there together and kind

00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:56,880
of like a wordpress team

00:18:57,299 --> 00:19:02,859
so you go to that you edit the states

00:19:00,129 --> 00:19:05,109
the states that you find are the default

00:19:02,859 --> 00:19:08,049
behavior the default state that each

00:19:05,109 --> 00:19:11,950
item is is in when you load the app and

00:19:08,049 --> 00:19:13,690
and then you edit a menu entry so you

00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:16,629
Adam at your menu entry so you find a

00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:18,789
HTML file menu HTML it'll have five

00:19:16,629 --> 00:19:20,889
items in it you add one more item to it

00:19:18,789 --> 00:19:22,659
then if you want a template for this so

00:19:20,889 --> 00:19:25,629
you can share templates you can say that

00:19:22,659 --> 00:19:26,979
the stage for this is that it's a news

00:19:25,629 --> 00:19:28,089
item but a news item is the exact same

00:19:26,979 --> 00:19:29,559
as a blog item so they can both share

00:19:28,089 --> 00:19:31,389
the same template and we call that

00:19:29,559 --> 00:19:32,469
article or something like that or you

00:19:31,389 --> 00:19:33,639
might need a new template because you

00:19:32,469 --> 00:19:35,109
might be creating a homepage and you

00:19:33,639 --> 00:19:36,129
might say okay for the homepage we're

00:19:35,109 --> 00:19:38,139
going to create a new template and then

00:19:36,129 --> 00:19:39,999
you create a controller if you need one

00:19:38,139 --> 00:19:41,349
so if there's interactivity on this page

00:19:39,999 --> 00:19:42,729
of the website that you want when you

00:19:41,349 --> 00:19:44,379
click on it it pops up in a modal or

00:19:42,729 --> 00:19:45,399
when you click on it it allows your

00:19:44,379 --> 00:19:46,899
camera to open up so you can take a

00:19:45,399 --> 00:19:49,269
picture and things like that if you need

00:19:46,899 --> 00:19:54,309
a controller you you create one so the

00:19:49,269 --> 00:19:56,229
state's we get here on first looking at

00:19:54,309 --> 00:19:57,580
ionic there's the playlist it's that's

00:19:56,229 --> 00:19:59,019
the homepage that you saw a moment ago

00:19:57,580 --> 00:20:01,719
to had a reggae and dub step and

00:19:59,019 --> 00:20:03,669
whatever else was on it so you can copy

00:20:01,719 --> 00:20:05,889
and paste that and start again and so

00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:07,809
we're gonna call apt about we're going

00:20:05,889 --> 00:20:09,999
to say the URL for this is / about so

00:20:07,809 --> 00:20:11,619
the URL for the first one there is none

00:20:09,999 --> 00:20:13,359
because of the default state and default

00:20:11,619 --> 00:20:14,739
state would be / playlist playlist so

00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:16,389
the home will always go back to that

00:20:14,739 --> 00:20:19,019
page so we'll see the URL for this is

00:20:16,389 --> 00:20:22,479
going to be / about it's going to use

00:20:19,019 --> 00:20:23,559
the template called about HTML and it's

00:20:22,479 --> 00:20:25,749
going to use a controller called about

00:20:23,559 --> 00:20:26,589
controller and we probably don't need

00:20:25,749 --> 00:20:27,999
that here because we're just going to

00:20:26,589 --> 00:20:29,019
create static content but if we were

00:20:27,999 --> 00:20:30,190
going to create something that was

00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:31,899
dynamic or something that needed

00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:33,759
interactivity that's that's the

00:20:31,899 --> 00:20:36,519
controller that would start kicking in

00:20:33,759 --> 00:20:39,609
so to add a menu item then you can see

00:20:36,519 --> 00:20:40,659
you got I on item open iron clothes and

00:20:39,609 --> 00:20:43,269
then there's closed near the bottom

00:20:40,659 --> 00:20:45,159
called I on list in ionic we don't use

00:20:43,269 --> 00:20:47,589
the elements that we have normally in

00:20:45,159 --> 00:20:50,259
HTML such as ul and alight for an

00:20:47,589 --> 00:20:52,059
unordered list and a list item ionic

00:20:50,259 --> 00:20:53,589
hazard zone directives that do its own

00:20:52,059 --> 00:20:58,149
special thing and presented this way so

00:20:53,589 --> 00:20:59,490
and I on list is a list as an UL and I

00:20:58,149 --> 00:21:02,790
on item is a list item

00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:04,200
in a lie but besides that it's basic

00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:06,120
HTML that you're you're right in there

00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:08,400
and so you give it a class called menu

00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:09,900
clothes which means it's presently

00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,910
closed and if it's clicked on it you get

00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:15,059
a class of men you open you give it a

00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:16,590
href to say it goes it / app / about so

00:21:15,059 --> 00:21:18,059
it'll bring us to our belt h and then

00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:20,220
you put in a title and we call it about

00:21:18,059 --> 00:21:25,500
me me me because I'm a megalomaniac

00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:28,260
apparently so this is a template and

00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:30,809
further this one here was the menu HTML

00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:33,120
template and this is the template we

00:21:30,809 --> 00:21:34,740
created called about that HTML and it's

00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:36,420
very simply because I own view title

00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:38,130
says about me me me just the very top of

00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:39,600
the page that's the type you get there

00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:41,190
and then we got a hitch one that says

00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:43,050
this is the about page and then we got a

00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:46,050
paragraph that says this content is so

00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:47,490
static why can't I be dynamic so what

00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:48,510
this is going to create an is on the

00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:50,550
left hand side you can see there's a new

00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:52,350
menu item and on on the bottom you can

00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:54,660
see this is the page that if you had

00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:56,940
clicked on about me me me yet see that

00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:59,910
word says discounted is so static why

00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:00,990
can't I e be dynamic and that's it

00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:02,880
really that's that's how you create

00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:04,410
pages for your for your apps that's

00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:07,290
that's fairly simple it's fairly basic

00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:09,690
HTML and you're even someone like me

00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:11,100
Chris get to grips with it so you want

00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:12,540
to create more pages well again you just

00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:15,090
going to repeat what you've seen above

00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:16,650
you're going to create a new state read

00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:17,910
it for a new page you're going to add a

00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:19,950
notice or you want to reuse an existing

00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:21,510
template you're going to add a menu

00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:25,590
Iseman to it and then you can eat some

00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:27,360
cake and it's it's not difficult but it

00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:29,780
does only create static content and we

00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:32,820
want more than static content because if

00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:34,350
we've only got static content and you

00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:37,920
want to change something for example you

00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:39,780
might have the word form f or m but you

00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:41,910
might have spelled it FR om from by

00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:42,929
accident well you gotta submit your app

00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:44,490
to the app store again because now you

00:22:42,929 --> 00:22:47,190
made a change to your app and that one's

00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:49,350
going to take maybe three weeks to

00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:50,300
accept your app or to refuse your app

00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:52,250
and

00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:54,530
you got to go to true that that system

00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:55,850
again so if we got dynamic content and

00:22:54,530 --> 00:22:56,810
that's that's that's degrading but using

00:22:55,850 --> 00:22:58,670
something like this and using something

00:22:56,810 --> 00:23:00,890
like drupal every time you add a news

00:22:58,670 --> 00:23:02,510
page to your website every time you had

00:23:00,890 --> 00:23:03,770
a blog post you don't have to resubmit

00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:05,360
or after the app store again I mean if

00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:07,220
that was the New York Times maybe 500

00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:09,860
articles a day they can't submit 500

00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:11,750
submissions of their app a day and wait

00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:13,790
for three weeks reach submission to come

00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:15,380
true so we need to dynamic we need to

00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:21,020
get these listing views and we need we

00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:23,150
need to pull these into our app so we

00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:25,310
can connect the dots we can take ionic

00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:26,660
framework which can do the Appy stuff we

00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:29,690
can take Drupal which can do the content

00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:31,100
management II stuff and we'll connect

00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:33,170
the children together to make a new

00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:34,310
service for ourselves so any content

00:23:33,170 --> 00:23:36,740
that's updated on the website and

00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:38,270
automatically gets updated on the app so

00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:40,610
if you change the spelling it's updated

00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:42,710
if you add a new blog post it's updated

00:23:40,610 --> 00:23:44,390
and you can go as far as adding new

00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:46,430
features to your website here to your

00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:49,070
app sorry and they would be

00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:51,020
automatically available on the app for

00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:52,730
for users as long as they're not adding

00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:53,900
new JavaScript functionality so for

00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:55,460
example if you don't have any mortal

00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:57,380
pop-ups but now a new version of your

00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:59,360
app once mortal pop ups then you got to

00:23:57,380 --> 00:24:00,830
resubmit that one again but if it's able

00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:03,250
to use the JavaScript is already there

00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:05,240
it's it's free game two stairs

00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:09,320
improvising doing doing what you're

00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:11,060
doing and okay so we're going to create

00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:12,290
something like this so this is this is

00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:14,330
the mark on rape at the top it says

00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:16,640
americano right EDT d stands for Chuck

00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:18,200
the dollar which is Irish for at houses

00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:20,030
of parliament so every every elected

00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:22,070
member of our Parliament is whatever her

00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:25,400
name is TD decisions you'd have MP in

00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:26,510
the United Kingdom and that it was an

00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:29,720
image there and that will come from a

00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:32,120
website actually and then it says hi my

00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:34,580
name is Mark Conroy and the mark Connery

00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:37,370
section of my name is comes from the

00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:38,600
data in Drupal the hi my name is dozen

00:24:37,370 --> 00:24:40,460
so this could be very generic that any

00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:41,750
politician could purchase this app for

00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:43,730
me and they've just got to fill out a

00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:44,990
form under a trooper website and will

00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:48,700
suck in the debt and have the nice

00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:51,230
friendly hello my name is items around

00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:53,420
the content only that then I was elected

00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:54,620
to the doll in 2016 etc that comes from

00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:56,660
Drupal

00:24:54,620 --> 00:25:00,320
and my constituency office is hard-coded

00:24:56,660 --> 00:25:02,530
into the app but the address I won't

00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:07,070
tell you it's actually my home address

00:25:02,530 --> 00:25:08,510
we shouldn't be there the address that

00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:10,790
comes down again from filling out a form

00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:12,110
on a drupal website so we create

00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:15,400
something that it's very simple app but

00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:15,400
that's just a simple home page first

00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:27,140
it's just add some tension you know

00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:29,000
create excitement okay so we're going to

00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:32,770
use data like this this is just a JSON

00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:36,050
object the data comes out as nodes and

00:25:32,770 --> 00:25:38,300
we got the first node then has a title

00:25:36,050 --> 00:25:40,700
has an image the source of the image

00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:43,370
then comes from sample content / images

00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:44,929
/ news / marc-andre web.jpg so what I've

00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:46,220
actually done here has taken the JSON

00:25:44,929 --> 00:25:47,720
from my websites or to be able to

00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:50,720
preview it live and so what's happening

00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:52,100
and just put it into a JSON file I'm not

00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:53,390
going to show life because when I try to

00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:55,370
give this presentation again for

00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:57,140
front-engine later it just kept my

00:25:55,370 --> 00:25:58,610
computer kept crashing so I've just

00:25:57,140 --> 00:26:00,440
taken screenshots instead but that's

00:25:58,610 --> 00:26:02,140
just sample content coming from coming

00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:04,160
from a directory inside inside ionic

00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:06,320
then we got a feel for phone number

00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:08,179
email constituency office short bio

00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:12,290
about me and then some social media

00:26:08,179 --> 00:26:14,720
links so using data like this we did i

00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:15,950
do something rounder yeah using data

00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,480
ladies were going to create a single

00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:18,590
page so we're going to have a template

00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:20,420
that we'll see in a minute and this

00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:22,250
template will say ng-controller sort of

00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:25,280
controller that we are using via angular

00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:26,120
ng-controller equals personal control so

00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:27,679
it's gonna use a controller called

00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:29,740
personal controller to be able to get

00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:32,600
this data and pull it into angular

00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:33,920
expressions we're going to use the HTTP

00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:35,809
service from that so we're going to

00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:39,200
dependency injection to set it as a

00:26:35,809 --> 00:26:42,190
dependency on this service HTTP every

00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:44,990
time this this this page is called

00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:47,660
injective service as a dependency into

00:26:44,990 --> 00:26:49,730
the into the app and we're going to use

00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:51,290
this to get the JSON data and then we're

00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:52,970
going to use an expression expression in

00:26:51,290 --> 00:26:55,550
angular the same as an expression in

00:26:52,970 --> 00:26:58,700
twig it's just too curly braces and we

00:26:55,550 --> 00:26:59,870
pop whatever we want inside there so

00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:01,350
here's the personal controller we've

00:26:59,870 --> 00:27:04,770
already created

00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:06,270
app equals angular app that my app or

00:27:04,770 --> 00:27:08,280
whatever it is an inside if we're going

00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:10,039
to have a duck controller and it's going

00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:13,890
to be called personal ctrl that's

00:27:10,039 --> 00:27:16,350
general accepted angular names for

00:27:13,890 --> 00:27:19,230
controller ctrl and it's got a function

00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:21,390
needs to serve the scope and HTTP so

00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:23,340
that's going to get at the set the

00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:25,710
directory called sample content in and

00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:27,630
then the file called personal info JSON

00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:31,070
in your case your drupal site this will

00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:33,630
be getting note / 1230 with the / user /

00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:35,990
admin or whatever whatever page you have

00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:38,549
the personal information on your website

00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:39,690
and then it's got two promises or

00:27:38,549 --> 00:27:42,500
returns a problem is really that if

00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:45,240
we're successful we'll sit and

00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:48,120
personalized erm will be equal to data

00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:50,130
nodes 0 and if there's an error well get

00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:52,620
the data printers to the console log and

00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:53,850
tell me in fairly good detail what the

00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:55,049
error is and where I need to go to fix

00:27:53,850 --> 00:27:57,240
it it even gives suggestions that if you

00:27:55,049 --> 00:28:01,730
try this this should fix it for you and

00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:05,039
so we can see data nodes 0 is here so

00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:08,970
nodes and then the first item in the in

00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:11,640
this array is node celebrities that's 20

00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:13,559
so using this then we will attach it

00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:16,080
with HTML that looks like this so we've

00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:17,880
got an eye on nav title that says genji

00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:20,190
controller for this so any place you you

00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:22,110
you find this stuff here use the

00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:24,270
personal controller and we got personal

00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:26,429
item know that title so again goes back

00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:28,559
to Jason finds no it finds that title

00:28:26,429 --> 00:28:31,020
and that will use that for the for the

00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:32,640
main title versus mark Conroy and then

00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:35,490
outside of that we got the letters TD so

00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:36,780
they're hard coded into this and I'm not

00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:38,929
very ambitious I could never use this

00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:42,720
app for anybody outside of Ireland and

00:28:38,929 --> 00:28:44,820
then we've got a second directive here

00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:47,280
so this is ion content so this is our

00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:48,299
body tag basically and that also use the

00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:50,700
same controller called personal

00:28:48,299 --> 00:28:52,080
controller and it initializes as being

00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:54,210
emptied at it and it should probably be

00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:55,980
in your javascript file and we give

00:28:54,210 --> 00:28:58,710
their class of header and we got an

00:28:55,980 --> 00:29:00,299
image source now we don't use image SRC

00:28:58,710 --> 00:29:03,059
equals when we're talking angular

00:29:00,299 --> 00:29:04,350
because if you try to do that what would

00:29:03,059 --> 00:29:06,539
happen is the image will try to load

00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:07,470
before the before the page is ready and

00:29:06,539 --> 00:29:09,480
if it does that we're going to get a

00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:11,010
blank so we use energy source so we know

00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:13,380
that angular says hang on there

00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:14,880
an image tag let me go fetch the data I

00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:16,620
want to find it bring it back and we'll

00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:18,090
take the image in we're supposed to be

00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:20,250
and then we've got the other information

00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:22,590
era hi my name is and person short bio

00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:24,930
and constituency office so if we look at

00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:26,910
the rendered app that we saw a second

00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:28,290
ago we can see then that the the page

00:29:26,910 --> 00:29:31,230
title or the apt title gets personal

00:29:28,290 --> 00:29:33,480
know that title the image source comes

00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:35,790
from personal note main image source and

00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:37,980
then the rest of it is the short bio and

00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:39,540
constituency office information and

00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:40,650
again it's it's fairly simple HTML that

00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:43,500
we're writing there's there's nothing

00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:46,910
very complex in it and if you want to

00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:50,270
create a listing page then so you've got

00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:52,080
elected or got a new cycling jersey

00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:55,770
something that's worth having a news

00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:56,910
post about and the distal that this will

00:29:55,770 --> 00:29:58,440
have a title than would have an image

00:29:56,910 --> 00:30:00,060
and maybe I read more link and we have

00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:02,100
maybe three of dollars at top of the

00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:04,590
page and on it up maybe seven just

00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:06,630
titles of the latest seven news articles

00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:10,220
or something like that and I put the

00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:13,260
date the time 24 to tree in the corner

00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:15,990
because I'm a badass and here's as

00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:17,430
complex as I could get at a time so

00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:19,050
we're gonna use data like this this is

00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:22,230
very similar what we saw a second ago

00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:25,560
except this is a JSON array with Jason

00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:28,050
objects inside of each node so we've got

00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:29,310
a node 1 47 at the top title mark

00:30:28,050 --> 00:30:31,410
Connery came for the code and stated for

00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:33,420
the community we got node with an idea

00:30:31,410 --> 00:30:35,760
of 2 260 at Marikana was reelected as TD

00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:37,980
for go away east and then we've got a

00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:40,730
node 147 again which is going to break

00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:42,990
the website so we can make a hard hat as

00:30:40,730 --> 00:30:44,580
marc-andre becomes the first ever TD

00:30:42,990 --> 00:30:46,620
elected from portumna that's the little

00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:48,810
village I come from so using that kind

00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:50,070
of data we create a listing page it's

00:30:48,810 --> 00:30:52,140
pretty much the exact same is what we

00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:53,730
did a moment ago in terms of you put in

00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:55,320
your title you put in your iron content

00:30:53,730 --> 00:30:57,180
and you give it a controller called news

00:30:55,320 --> 00:31:00,960
control or whatever it is except we're

00:30:57,180 --> 00:31:03,090
going to use a new angular and property

00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:05,810
notice called ng-repeat and this is

00:31:03,090 --> 00:31:08,390
basically your fur loop in in a in

00:31:05,810 --> 00:31:11,840
PHP and that says that it you know

00:31:08,390 --> 00:31:13,310
repeat this little template here over

00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:14,710
and over again each time for each item

00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:17,180
that you find that matches the

00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:18,860
parameters that we give it and then

00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:20,450
we're going to add a click function that

00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:22,490
says that if you click on this up here

00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:23,990
don't open the stock browser it comes

00:31:22,490 --> 00:31:25,640
with the app so don't open Safari or

00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:27,830
don't open Chrome or don't open whatever

00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:29,570
apps come instead open the link inside

00:31:27,830 --> 00:31:31,490
the app so that it looks like a nap

00:31:29,570 --> 00:31:32,960
because remember this is this is a small

00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:34,130
website in this idea as opposed to an

00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:36,260
actual app it's wrapped up inside a

00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:39,080
webview so if we've gotta tell it don't

00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:40,970
open up the external browser so this

00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:42,620
it's a slight bit longer here but it's

00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:44,540
it's not much more detailed really than

00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:47,000
than the personal controller so we're

00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:49,010
again going to say use HTTP service to

00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:52,220
get sample content / news / JSON so

00:31:49,010 --> 00:31:53,840
that's the news listing page data that

00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:56,150
nodes is going to be our scope here and

00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:58,160
then scope that brow so if you do want

00:31:56,150 --> 00:31:59,960
to browse something if you do click on

00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:03,050
whatever it is and you want to use the

00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:04,310
browser and then it's going to say stay

00:32:03,050 --> 00:32:06,670
inside our own system don't use the

00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:09,440
don't use the systems that come with the

00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:11,150
with with the with the phone or did the

00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:15,050
tablet that you're that you're presently

00:32:11,150 --> 00:32:16,130
using and then we got a local storage

00:32:15,050 --> 00:32:17,770
stuff there that's going to stringify

00:32:16,130 --> 00:32:20,270
stuff so this will allow us to actually

00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:22,670
store stuff on people's phones or

00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:24,020
people's tablets for offline use and

00:32:22,670 --> 00:32:25,760
then if there's an error well same as

00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:27,290
usual really print out here will you

00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:29,420
tell us what it was and give us as much

00:32:27,290 --> 00:32:31,670
details as you can and it will and then

00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:34,400
the list and is we we saw from early

00:32:31,670 --> 00:32:37,430
round I on list creates a list instead

00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:39,140
of UL I on item creates a list item

00:32:37,430 --> 00:32:41,810
instead of Li and there because the

00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:43,700
ng-repeat node in nodes so it's clean

00:32:41,810 --> 00:32:45,530
for each key as value so we're going to

00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:48,920
say for each item in nodes will call

00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:51,200
them node and ng if so if the index is

00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:52,430
less than three says that only give you

00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,630
back the first three options over the

00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:55,520
first three options i'm going to use

00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:57,020
this template and under this i can have

00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:59,420
the same thing and say for anything post

00:32:57,020 --> 00:33:01,580
tree options give me a slightly amended

00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:05,710
view so on this one here give me an the

00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:07,700
no title and h2 element and give me a

00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:09,350
dividend that has a class of image

00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:11,540
holder and has an image and then after

00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:14,720
that i have just h2 is just for my list

00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:16,240
and that's basically your news listing

00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:18,400
page so we've got the ng-repeat

00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:20,679
no the nodes we got to know that know

00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:22,390
the title at the top and image energy

00:33:20,679 --> 00:33:25,120
source at the bottom and that repeats

00:33:22,390 --> 00:33:26,559
two or three times and that's that's

00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:29,770
that's your static pages that your

00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:31,660
dynamic about us page that are managed

00:33:29,770 --> 00:33:32,800
in one management system and presented

00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:35,380
here and this is now your listing pages

00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:36,910
that's a lot of what you really need I

00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:38,770
suppose from a nap without starting to

00:33:36,910 --> 00:33:41,470
get into the not getting started with

00:33:38,770 --> 00:33:43,570
ionic framework presentation so if you

00:33:41,470 --> 00:33:44,910
need more app in more data in your app

00:33:43,570 --> 00:33:47,320
you're going to just repeat the above

00:33:44,910 --> 00:33:48,220
again and again and again so whatever

00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:50,500
you want to do if you're creating a

00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:52,120
single page or a listing page that's the

00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:54,340
things that you need to get those going

00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:56,920
and then you got to build the app so we

00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:58,600
keep going through these we add our CSS

00:33:56,920 --> 00:34:01,720
we add our SAS or whatever it is we make

00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:03,040
it look the way we want it to look so to

00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:05,080
build the up then you go back to your

00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:06,790
terminal UCD to the directory where your

00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:08,830
app is in your room and ionic build

00:34:06,790 --> 00:34:10,419
Android and that takes maybe 30 seconds

00:34:08,830 --> 00:34:12,070
or a minute or so it builds you an

00:34:10,419 --> 00:34:14,470
Android app and then you're in a second

00:34:12,070 --> 00:34:15,760
command ionic build iOS and again takes

00:34:14,470 --> 00:34:18,369
another charger seconds or a minute and

00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:20,320
it builds you an iOS app and then you

00:34:18,369 --> 00:34:22,389
can test them so presume you've got an

00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:24,580
android emulator and presume you've got

00:34:22,389 --> 00:34:26,679
an iOS emulator on your on your on your

00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:28,540
computer's you just ruin ionic emulate

00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:30,070
Android it powers up the Android and it

00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:32,770
shows you what it's going to look like

00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:34,119
ionic emulate iOS and it shows that for

00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:36,850
that looks what's going to look like in

00:34:34,119 --> 00:34:38,260
your iOS simulator or what I think is

00:34:36,850 --> 00:34:40,270
brilliant if you have an ionic cloud

00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:41,770
account you can upload your app to lie

00:34:40,270 --> 00:34:44,200
on a cloud you can download an app

00:34:41,770 --> 00:34:45,429
called ionic view and then you can see

00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:46,690
your app in real time on your phone

00:34:45,429 --> 00:34:49,030
that's not even connected to your

00:34:46,690 --> 00:34:50,919
computer and you can send a link to your

00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:52,840
friends or whatever or associates in

00:34:50,919 --> 00:34:53,859
your company and everyone can run in the

00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:55,119
app as well so you're not just using an

00:34:53,859 --> 00:34:57,430
emulator you're actually testing the app

00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:58,930
on a real device in real time and seen

00:34:57,430 --> 00:35:03,910
exactly what happens and how it works

00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:05,770
and that part of ionic is free and so

00:35:03,910 --> 00:35:08,170
then we deploy the apt into the clarity

00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:11,290
you set up an account on ionic I on a

00:35:08,170 --> 00:35:12,400
cloud and you register your app and then

00:35:11,290 --> 00:35:13,990
you can come out

00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:15,700
commanders I think this ionic upload and

00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:17,410
that just uploads the app and whatever

00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:18,490
new features you've built into it other

00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:20,890
people will downloads when you click on

00:35:18,490 --> 00:35:28,420
ionic view app inside your phone you can

00:35:20,890 --> 00:35:30,400
you can use use that and and yeah so the

00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:32,140
only cloud is this is this is where it

00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:34,720
just becomes not free so this is this is

00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:39,039
the we said the Acquia part of Drupal

00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:50,380
just for one second my alarm protect my

00:35:39,039 --> 00:35:52,660
kids in school ok so this where we've

00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:54,190
used a free open-source version of ionic

00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:56,410
and we've created yep that we want and

00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:57,789
now we need to install our app somewhere

00:35:56,410 --> 00:36:00,069
so you can submit it to the App Store

00:35:57,789 --> 00:36:01,480
you can submit to google play store or

00:36:00,069 --> 00:36:04,029
you can submit it to the eye on a cloud

00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:06,700
and that's the store i would be using

00:36:04,029 --> 00:36:09,549
because when you when you upload it to

00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:11,109
their even upload your updates as well

00:36:09,549 --> 00:36:12,400
without submitting anything back into

00:36:11,109 --> 00:36:14,200
the app store again on esters an appt a

00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:16,990
new feature coming on that these new

00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:18,760
Java scripts and and it's very cheap and

00:36:16,990 --> 00:36:20,260
they have push notification built into

00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:21,549
it and they have authentication both

00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:23,289
built into it and they have lots and

00:36:21,549 --> 00:36:25,480
lots of service to give you know do all

00:36:23,289 --> 00:36:26,770
the all the server admins dough from the

00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:28,990
service that you might want from a nap

00:36:26,770 --> 00:36:31,180
to make it a proper app app not just

00:36:28,990 --> 00:36:34,930
something as simple as listing pages and

00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:36,849
details pages and and it's as cheap as i

00:36:34,930 --> 00:36:37,990
think twenty dollars per month per app

00:36:36,849 --> 00:36:42,430
and that will give you something like a

00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:44,319
million push notifications ok so de

00:36:42,430 --> 00:36:45,730
plane into Apple and Google you got a

00:36:44,319 --> 00:36:47,529
creator developer counts you gotta jump

00:36:45,730 --> 00:36:49,630
through some hoops you got to upload

00:36:47,529 --> 00:36:51,970
your app you gotta wait and then you

00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:53,140
will have your app accepted hopefully

00:36:51,970 --> 00:36:54,640
now you would have to go to that stage

00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:56,200
you do have to submit it to the App

00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:57,369
Store's to be able to be used on the app

00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:59,470
store maybe not with Google because

00:36:57,369 --> 00:37:01,630
Android allow you to install external

00:36:59,470 --> 00:37:03,970
apps but you will have to submit at

00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:06,760
least once to your to the apple app

00:37:03,970 --> 00:37:08,190
store and just so it's verified and then

00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:12,480
you can you can maintain it will say

00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:23,910
from the ionic cloud infrastructure and

00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:26,790
oh that's it there i told i had another

00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:28,440
slice or two please I've been asked to

00:37:26,790 --> 00:37:30,660
mention this do join us for contribution

00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:31,619
sprints if you've never contributed

00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:33,000
before it's a great way to get started

00:37:31,619 --> 00:37:35,060
if you have contributed before it's a

00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:38,790
great way to continue contributing and

the experience for people and get better

00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:48,660
presentations or presentations of equal

00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:50,160
quality each year and thirdly front end

00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:52,170
United which i think is absolutely

00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:53,430
brilliant and great great value for

00:37:52,170 --> 00:37:57,780
money it's done and happens next year

00:37:53,430 --> 00:38:00,420
26th 27th of May and come listen to me

00:37:57,780 --> 00:38:07,320
again and that is this thanks for

00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:08,550
listening honey questions okay i can

00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:11,900
just a microphone here it's probably

00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:11,900
turned on if that's easier

00:38:18,650 --> 00:38:23,180
hi Thanks I saw it on one of the

00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:24,380
templates you had done something where

00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:27,530
it's supposed to use the internal

00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:30,500
storage on the phone yes is store the

00:38:27,530 --> 00:38:32,450
data yep how does it work with that like

00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:34,250
when you first connect to the app if

00:38:32,450 --> 00:38:36,800
they don't have internet access to they

00:38:34,250 --> 00:38:38,960
not see anything does it wait until they

00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:40,640
view a page first before it stores is if

00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:44,570
they have no internet access they won't

00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:45,680
see anything yes okay and you see what's

00:38:44,570 --> 00:38:46,850
already stored that's it but if you've

00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:49,190
never got the app in the first place

00:38:46,850 --> 00:38:50,390
you're going to get it okay I guess just

00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:52,550
a shell of a listing page I won't have

00:38:50,390 --> 00:38:54,110
won't have data in it okay thanks

00:38:52,550 --> 00:38:55,670
because all the dad has stored

00:38:54,110 --> 00:38:57,260
externally unless you can actually go

00:38:55,670 --> 00:39:02,530
and get that stuff it's not gonna not

00:38:57,260 --> 00:39:02,530
gonna come back for you just one second

00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:18,920
yeah I was ready for some questions so

00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:20,390
if you need to extend that that's what

00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:22,610
you're saying here basically you can

00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:23,840
create your own plugins and if you can't

00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:25,370
create the plugin that you wanted to do

00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:27,770
so if you want this kind of offering

00:39:25,370 --> 00:39:29,750
type stuff and that any card over

00:39:27,770 --> 00:39:32,230
plugins that are available then you can

00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:37,280
you can use those in inside your app

00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:39,920
alright so my question is when you

00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:44,300
mention like you can compile on Android

00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:47,900
or iOS you have to have these channels

00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:51,050
of distributions based on the and iOS or

00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:52,970
Android or you can create your own kind

00:39:51,050 --> 00:39:56,650
of a channel of distribution so you can

00:39:52,970 --> 00:39:56,650
wrap your own apps

00:39:56,740 --> 00:40:01,840
so I don't understand the question the

00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:05,770
question is if if it's possible with

00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:09,580
this process to create your own app

00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:11,440
store I don't see why not yeah the app

00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:13,119
is just getting served from somewhere so

00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:15,640
you can upload observed from the App

00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:16,990
Store and even served from iCloud you

00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:19,240
can serve from google play or you can

00:40:16,990 --> 00:40:20,920
serve it from your own server what what

00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:21,940
I on a cloud is setting up is based like

00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:23,770
what a qui I do but you don't have to

00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:24,790
host a troop website what area is we

00:40:23,770 --> 00:40:27,130
look after all the infrastructure and

00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:28,360
maintenance and it's a the website is

00:40:27,130 --> 00:40:29,860
available there so it's the same thing

00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:31,720
you could even host where you want to

00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:33,250
host as far as i know i might be wrong

00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:34,300
but as far as i know that's that's what

00:40:33,250 --> 00:40:35,670
you can do and then you can set up

00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:38,190
america through our other people host

00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:41,280
their apps from your marketplace as well

00:40:38,190 --> 00:40:41,280
thank you

00:40:50,530 --> 00:40:55,220
okay so the question is if you have push

00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:56,450
notifications to your app can that be

00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:58,099
managed from Drupal erdas that happy

00:40:56,450 --> 00:40:59,090
management somewhere else my

00:40:58,099 --> 00:41:01,580
understanding is you can manage that

00:40:59,090 --> 00:41:03,200
from Drupal but I haven't implied push

00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:05,900
notifications but I don't see why it

00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:07,369
will be any problem with having a an

00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:09,109
entity type called push notifications

00:41:07,369 --> 00:41:12,230
and you type in one and it just goes and

00:41:09,109 --> 00:41:18,050
sends to your ionic there is a module

00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:22,270
indeed oh there you yep simple yep dumb

00:41:18,050 --> 00:41:25,760
question that you recommend using say

00:41:22,270 --> 00:41:29,330
module in Drupal I self as a custom

00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:31,849
functionality you said most of you most

00:41:29,330 --> 00:41:33,530
of the dynamic information be limited in

00:41:31,849 --> 00:41:35,359
your app to a view but is it possible

00:41:33,530 --> 00:41:38,000
for it to be also like through a custom

00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:40,849
modules you have to do do you recommend

00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:42,170
that or use Cordova or other things to

00:41:40,849 --> 00:41:43,520
bring everything like a mousse because

00:41:42,170 --> 00:41:44,930
it's so simple and because it's the

00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:46,730
Drupal way of doing things it you can

00:41:44,930 --> 00:41:48,590
write a custom modular custom SQL query

00:41:46,730 --> 00:41:51,099
or whatever you wants to yourself to

00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:54,230
extract that and make it available and

00:41:51,099 --> 00:41:55,910
I'd be nervous of creating technical

00:41:54,230 --> 00:41:59,210
debt by having all your own custom

00:41:55,910 --> 00:42:00,440
queries that do things and somebody else

00:41:59,210 --> 00:42:02,720
might have to look after a similar stage

00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:04,160
and when it's a simple this creative

00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:06,140
view that lists what you want i don't i

00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:09,170
don't see reason not to do that okay

00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:11,240
yeah could that i was i get to fill in

00:42:09,170 --> 00:42:14,270
the question more was looking for a

00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:16,700
javascript timer and javascript timer

00:42:14,270 --> 00:42:18,290
and drupal and then that would that be

00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:21,320
pulled into the app or they'd be better

00:42:18,290 --> 00:42:23,450
to use a timer and / cordova or part of

00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:29,160
in that case I think you'd use a timer

00:42:23,450 --> 00:42:33,180
start of Cordova thank you yep

00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:35,400
and I creating those through the app so

00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:37,690
was it difficult to do

00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:56,950
the question is can you edit or create

00:42:37,690 --> 00:42:58,390
new nodes Trudy up I don't know yeah I

00:42:56,950 --> 00:43:00,370
guess if you're using the HTTP service

00:42:58,390 --> 00:43:02,470
that's what's getting json you're going

00:43:00,370 --> 00:43:15,180
to say post dear son really and consume

00:43:02,470 --> 00:43:15,180
data that was a good question yeah yes

00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:24,510
div III haven't looked at a drupal gap

00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:26,369
very much phonegap for this was actually

00:43:24,510 --> 00:43:29,010
built on phonegap originally and I'm

00:43:26,369 --> 00:43:30,180
Cordova the guys at ionic and I don't

00:43:29,010 --> 00:43:31,589
want to speak furthermore I don't know

00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:34,109
them and I don't know a huge amount

00:43:31,589 --> 00:43:35,400
about phonegap or that either but my

00:43:34,109 --> 00:43:37,290
understanding was they decided what they

00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:39,630
were building was like throwing up but

00:43:37,290 --> 00:43:41,130
was so much more better and adding

00:43:39,630 --> 00:43:43,559
better features and better way of doing

00:43:41,130 --> 00:43:46,230
things that they decided to busy for

00:43:43,559 --> 00:43:49,740
phonegap and this is in their view an

00:43:46,230 --> 00:43:52,730
enhanced version of phonegap if that

00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:52,730
makes it better I'm not sure

00:44:00,150 --> 00:44:05,180
okay the websites there's basically tree

00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:17,330
oh I didn't have a website it's just my

00:44:13,290 --> 00:44:17,330
own playing around on localized version

00:44:19,070 --> 00:44:22,670
it looks similar to

00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:29,869
yeah I don't see why not you're just

00:44:27,380 --> 00:44:31,970
building a web app that uses angular 2

00:44:29,869 --> 00:44:33,950
to render your content so it's it's

00:44:31,970 --> 00:44:36,589
pretty much the exact same if i was to

00:44:33,950 --> 00:44:38,829
an ionic serve now inside we go try do

00:44:36,589 --> 00:44:38,829
that

00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:46,859
terminal

00:45:00,010 --> 00:45:03,830
absolutely yeah yeah because all you're

00:45:02,750 --> 00:45:05,120
doing is taking the data you're not

00:45:03,830 --> 00:45:08,060
taking on you to CSS from your drupal

00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:09,230
website so you're going invariably at

00:45:08,060 --> 00:45:11,390
the same you get a very ugly true but

00:45:09,230 --> 00:45:12,710
when you turn it on first but the two

00:45:11,390 --> 00:45:14,570
templates that you're using are

00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:15,890
different and the CSS that you use is

00:45:14,570 --> 00:45:18,650
going to be different you could maybe

00:45:15,890 --> 00:45:21,260
share CSS by using an external CSS file

00:45:18,650 --> 00:45:23,720
but in general yes it's going to be

00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:25,100
totally different unless I presume you'd

00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:29,530
want to make it look similar to your

00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:34,160
whatever your branding is if I cd2

00:45:29,530 --> 00:45:37,760
squiggly things less HD taxes Bionic

00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:43,010
getting started getting started site

00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:45,080
menu and ionic serve so justjust will

00:45:43,010 --> 00:45:47,740
load up the website first or should load

00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:47,740
up the website for us

00:45:54,370 --> 00:46:01,000
sorry serve ionic serve so it served

00:45:59,650 --> 00:46:02,530
website said that should open up in

00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:05,770
Firefox and then if you change any files

00:46:02,530 --> 00:46:07,840
inside and here comes out so does her

00:46:05,770 --> 00:46:11,230
home page and this is our login and

00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:13,480
here's our about me make a bit small to

00:46:11,230 --> 00:46:15,160
make a look more like a nap and if you

00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:17,290
change anything down any files reddit or

00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:19,360
CSS or javascript or HTML inside your

00:46:17,290 --> 00:46:22,990
www folder this will live reload

00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:24,070
automatically and show your preview it

00:46:22,990 --> 00:46:25,060
doesn't do some of the things you want

00:46:24,070 --> 00:46:26,890
like that doesn't it doesn't have the

00:46:25,060 --> 00:46:28,510
native capabilities of you know using

00:46:26,890 --> 00:46:31,210
camera using geolocation and using that

00:46:28,510 --> 00:46:33,640
kind of phone features so you're better

00:46:31,210 --> 00:46:36,570
to serve this inside the iOS emulator or

00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:36,570
the Android emulators

00:46:41,770 --> 00:46:48,970
when you get an xserve like nothing yep

00:46:52,369 --> 00:47:01,630
oh very good I wish you give this

00:46:56,089 --> 00:47:01,630
presentation dude it's not a club

00:47:05,109 --> 00:47:12,369
excellent okay we believe it at that

00:47:09,279 --> 00:47:12,369
