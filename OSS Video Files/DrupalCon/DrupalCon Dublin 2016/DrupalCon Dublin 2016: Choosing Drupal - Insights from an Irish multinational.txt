um okay we'll make a start so welcome

00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:07,410
along to our presentation choosing

00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:09,630
Drupal inside some an Irish

00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:11,070
multinational so a bit about myself my

00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:12,929
name is Alan Burke would honor tech were

00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:14,400
going to sponsors here where the main

00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:16,830
Irish Drupal development company in our

00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,660
own minds in any case and I've been

00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:20,970
doing doable for far too long this is

00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:22,230
about ten years at rubicon I was a

00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:24,810
trooper ton of Brussels and have been at

00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:28,170
almost every European drupalcon and be

00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:29,640
involved in various core things over the

00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:32,640
years primarily at the front end and

00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:34,829
some testing and in terms of an attack

00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,090
where full service doable agency do not

00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:37,710
to work for various organizations with

00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:41,309
Ireland little bit of stuff in the UK

00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:43,829
and beyond as well and so that's my

00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:46,350
backstory here tuple and aisling yeah

00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:47,820
sure so hey everyone I'm Aisling I work

00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:50,399
as a technical associate with in the

00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:53,430
digital media team in Gambia my role is

00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,989
quite broad and so I work with the build

00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:57,000
of sites from a day of and PM

00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:58,590
perspective this all depends on the

00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,199
resource and scale of the project itself

00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:03,449
I would also work a lot with glam be as

00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:06,060
current sites o'clock across platforms

00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:08,939
just everyday maintaining content

00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:10,439
uploads etc and and because of this i

00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:12,119
was highly involved in choosing a

00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:13,979
platform within Glanbia just to

00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:16,920
standardize and just to give some

00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:19,170
context digital media almost sits like

00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:20,759
an agency within glam beer so the

00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:23,330
business would come to us for sites

00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:25,740
campaigns social analytics you name it

00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:28,350
sometimes we may even actually have to

00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:30,329
compete against external agencies and

00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:31,979
that is because the vast size of our

00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:34,500
organization but we are constantly

00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:36,600
trying to improve and set standards and

00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:39,060
processes so our main goal within

00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:41,130
digital media is to create a set of

00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:43,890
standard platforms and processes to work

00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:45,780
with and maintain digital excellence so

00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:48,240
just to give a quick overview of Google

00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:51,750
ambia air Columbia are a global

00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:54,210
performance nutrition group and we

00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:56,460
employ over 6,000 people across 32

00:01:54,210 --> 00:02:00,509
countries we distribute and sell

00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:03,240
products across 130 and countries so we

00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:05,880
have four main sectors and number one

00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:07,380
being glam beer performance nutrition so

00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:09,720
glanbia performance nutrition is the

00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:12,270
number one global grand brand

00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:13,840
performance nutrition and it's a

00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:16,510
portfolio made of

00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:19,420
BSN option nutrition are you so pure

00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:20,620
nutri me know kington ABB you may have

00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:22,989
heard of some of these protein brands

00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:24,610
before and although the product makeup

00:02:22,989 --> 00:02:28,209
is quite similar each brand has a

00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:30,849
specific target market and we then move

00:02:28,209 --> 00:02:32,019
on to glam be and nutritionals and we'll

00:02:30,849 --> 00:02:34,090
be talking quite a bit about this

00:02:32,019 --> 00:02:36,489
business sector as it is one of our

00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:38,769
recent go lives within Drupal ish so

00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:40,870
it's quite a complex business unit it's

00:02:38,769 --> 00:02:43,360
made up of three business business units

00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:46,060
which amanda gated this year so we have

00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:49,840
customized solutions glam ingredients

00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:52,209
technologies and along with many of our

00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:54,220
cheese businesses so the main thing with

00:02:52,209 --> 00:02:56,200
lambier nutritionals is that it is a

00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:58,480
source of raw ingredient from dairy

00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:00,250
non-dairy nutritional and functional

00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,049
ingredients so as you can imagine there

00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:03,879
is a lot of content around all those

00:03:02,049 --> 00:03:07,420
different products and ingredients it's

00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:09,579
a b2b business so and customers and

00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:10,900
businesses businesses would reach out to

00:03:09,579 --> 00:03:13,209
glam be nutritionals if they were

00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:15,010
thinking to develop a new product and

00:03:13,209 --> 00:03:18,010
needed the ingredients and innovation to

00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:20,530
do so we then have some joint ventures

00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:23,500
that's our turret section so we treat

00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:26,650
redic joint ventures & Associates we to

00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:28,810
cheese companies and Glanbia ingredients

00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:30,430
Ireland which is also another Drupal

00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:33,180
site one of the first sites we went live

00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:36,790
with last year again in the b2b space

00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:40,690
and lastly we have dairy Ireland so this

00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:43,180
compromises of two business units and in

00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:44,889
here we have branded consumer products

00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:47,590
from a dairy perspective such as

00:03:44,889 --> 00:03:49,720
avonmore you may heard of and also the

00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:52,859
indie irish agricultural space so more

00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:55,389
so the inputs such as animal feed and

00:03:52,859 --> 00:03:57,040
agriculture so that's just a very very

00:03:55,389 --> 00:04:00,010
quick overview of what you'd of what we

00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:02,889
do you can see it's quite complex as you

00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:04,540
can imagine we have numerous sites new

00:04:02,889 --> 00:04:08,230
sites in there so going to give an

00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:10,030
overview of the talk itself so first

00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:11,380
four seconds sorry I just talk itself so

00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:13,389
what I'm going to talk about is why

00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:14,709
lumbia came to Drupal so this was

00:04:13,389 --> 00:04:17,380
interesting from our perspective as an

00:04:14,709 --> 00:04:21,519
architect because we I suppose to our

00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:23,590
existing on Malaysia so to our I don't

00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:24,820
know um detriment we only became

00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:26,650
involved in this project at the very

00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:27,490
very end and a reality we would have

00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:29,620
liked to be involved in the

00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:32,380
very start so that led us to ask why was

00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:33,610
that how come at lumbia global

00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:36,009
multinational based here in ireland

00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:37,720
weren't talking to the main irish drupal

00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:39,310
company so we want to find out a bit

00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:41,380
about that so this this presentation is

00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:43,090
about that process what log be a went

00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:44,650
through and their process in choosing

00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:45,880
drupal and and it led us to understand

00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:47,979
why it was they weren't knocking on our

00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:50,110
door so logically speaking we're a small

00:04:47,979 --> 00:04:51,610
company this 15 of us columbia air mass

00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:53,289
of multinational thousands and thousands

00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:56,259
people buying and selling business units

00:04:53,289 --> 00:04:57,819
day by day almost so the context there

00:04:56,259 --> 00:05:00,009
is that we're very much a small fry in

00:04:57,819 --> 00:05:01,270
those eyes and their eyes but still we

00:05:00,009 --> 00:05:04,750
were still perplexed by this so this

00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:06,970
talk explains why that came to be and so

00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:08,650
we'll start off with so we have a back

00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:10,900
story about columbia and and their

00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:12,220
business and what they do but i want to

00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:15,159
talk about the situation that was in

00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:16,630
place in columbia before drupal so i

00:05:15,159 --> 00:05:18,069
actually mentioned that the digital

00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:20,259
media team within lumbia is a

00:05:18,069 --> 00:05:22,330
semi-autonomous business unit so they

00:05:20,259 --> 00:05:24,940
have to fight for projects from various

00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:26,680
other columbia divisions so that they

00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:28,659
you know they don't win them all they

00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:29,949
got to compete against our agencies it

00:05:28,659 --> 00:05:31,419
hasn't happened yet but in theory we

00:05:29,949 --> 00:05:33,550
could be competing with the digital

00:05:31,419 --> 00:05:34,990
media team on a very on a project where

00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:36,490
a business unit might come to us is hey

00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:40,000
can you build our project and that kind

00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:41,380
of stuff however and before the didn't

00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,880
immediately and came into existence what

00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:44,800
happened was all the individual business

00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,360
units they're relatively autonomous

00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,070
within the context of global

00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:49,360
multinationals the individual business

00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:50,919
units and in particular the marketing

00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,870
departments within those business units

00:05:50,919 --> 00:05:54,310
had a lot of autonomy they could go and

00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:55,960
do whatever they pleased they didn't

00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:57,849
have to worry about i.t in terms of hey

00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:59,199
I t we need another website they just

00:05:57,849 --> 00:06:01,389
went off and got it done themselves and

00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:05,110
a lot of them a lot of them are

00:06:01,389 --> 00:06:06,340
marketing sites but there's a couple of

00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:07,900
sites out there with an intriguing

00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:10,539
amount of functionality in terms of

00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:12,789
relationships with suppliers and there

00:06:10,539 --> 00:06:14,380
is certain amount of b2c stuff but not a

00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:15,969
whole ball predominately b2c marketing

00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:18,400
and that's the context in which a lot of

00:06:15,969 --> 00:06:20,560
these at least this this phase we're

00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,759
talking about takes place so those

00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,900
independent units they would after

00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:25,030
whatever agency they were dealing with

00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:27,099
for the last ten years got some website

00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:29,530
builds and it did its job and it's up

00:06:27,099 --> 00:06:31,719
there and it's running and but then the

00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:33,219
digital media team was formed and their

00:06:31,719 --> 00:06:34,690
role within Llambias they should be the

00:06:33,219 --> 00:06:36,729
first point of contact for all of these

00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:39,339
websites so what should happen is that

00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:40,990
all these websites should be supported

00:06:39,339 --> 00:06:43,390
maintained developed improve

00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:45,160
patched whatever you might say by that

00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:47,080
digital media team and they should be

00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:49,180
the first point of contact for lumbia

00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:50,050
business units and I since acting said

00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:51,460
that doesn't know what's happened

00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:54,130
sometimes they go to external agencies

00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:56,560
but what the digital media team found

00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:58,570
was suddenly they were being landed with

00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:01,630
an absolute s'mores board as the word I

00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:03,910
used of technologies to support so when

00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:05,290
they started doing you know maybe not as

00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:06,910
far as an ordered but they had a look

00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:10,270
around and go okay what do we got here

00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:13,810
so they had WordPress of various hues in

00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:15,640
terms of customization age and how well

00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:17,500
it was kept up to date that was a common

00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:18,520
platform for various marketing sites but

00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:22,210
then at the other level there was

00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:24,820
various things like Sitecore and it was

00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:26,320
in play hybris is an essay p product to

00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:27,940
use for ecommerce stuff so that was a

00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:30,940
very that was in use and is still in use

00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:32,980
and beck city is a very big part of how

00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:34,420
lumbia run their business internally so

00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:36,430
hybrids was a natural extension of that

00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:37,990
obviously they would have evaluated

00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:39,400
adobe for various products and we'll

00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:42,310
talk about adobe a little bit more later

00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:44,170
on in the in the presentation as well so

00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:46,540
then you'd various custom platforms I

00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:49,000
talked about some of the services where

00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:50,740
they do you know semi complex web sites

00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,120
for partner relationship so some of

00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:54,700
those were built with custom platforms

00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:56,230
using who knows they're just sitting

00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:58,060
there working away doing their job and a

00:07:56,230 --> 00:08:00,040
day to day basis with somebody somewhere

00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:01,660
praying that they don't fall down then

00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:03,670
they've got obviously they're going to

00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:04,930
have some static sites as well and I

00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:06,280
don't know if you guys had any joomla

00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:08,170
but because I know Jim I got evaluated

00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:10,540
later on but so you're left with this

00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:12,640
vast array of technologies that the

00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:15,190
digital media team was then expected to

00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:16,810
support so did this start led to a

00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:18,670
problem it's it's not that it's

00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:20,080
impossible to support every single

00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:22,120
platform on the planet but it's not

00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:24,430
realistic and it's not realistic within

00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:26,140
the budgets and working as a competitive

00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:27,370
business unit so the business you will

00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:29,650
have to decide okay how we're going to

00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:31,990
handle this so the decision was we need

00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:34,210
to standardize on some platforms some

00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:37,180
CMS that will help us run a wide variety

00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:39,880
of different websites across across the

00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:43,180
globe so that that's the situation they

00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:45,190
were in and you know they're still in

00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:46,990
this a hybrid situation whereby you know

00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:48,790
an independent business our business

00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:50,410
units can still come from tell you look

00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:52,690
pierce this wordpress site we did six

00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:54,320
months ago can you guys just make sure

00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:56,180
it lives

00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,470
like that that's an awkward position

00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:58,490
with them to be in but that's currently

00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:00,530
where things are they're not in a

00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:01,880
position to dictate and go hey yeah you

00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:03,620
can go independent and go to your own

00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:04,550
agencies but you've got to use Drupal

00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:05,990
and that's something that might change

00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:10,490
over time but you know that hasn't

00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:12,080
happened just yet so yeah so too much

00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:14,450
cheese so this this was the problem this

00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,800
disparity much stuff and far too much

00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:17,450
stuff that they needed to deal with I'm

00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:19,160
just make sure covered them all oh yeah

00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:23,630
so the other the other issues that they

00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:25,400
they had to deal with were hosting so

00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:27,440
and this this have a little bit is

00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:29,030
interesting because and within the

00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,650
context of these websites how the

00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:32,810
application and the hosting platform

00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:35,570
we're very much considered and in a

00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:36,590
single entity and or at least consider

00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:37,910
that you know if you're going to look

00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:39,530
after this website you're looking after

00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:41,120
the hosting as well it's not something

00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:42,320
you can say oh well we looking after the

00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:45,020
application we look up the website and

00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,550
somebody else looks after the hosting so

00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:48,650
again when they did their they did their

00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:50,210
ordered so to speak it wasn't a formal

00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:51,800
order so don't like this network but

00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:53,090
they did the review of everything that

00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:55,970
was there they found that it was hosting

00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:57,710
with things like Rackspace various

00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:58,790
independent hosting vendors with in

00:09:57,710 --> 00:10:01,850
Ireland the reason from the club black

00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:04,850
knights and so again a wide variety and

00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:06,080
a wide range of of supporter platforms

00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:07,310
that they had to deal with and different

00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,900
hosting companies that they had to deal

00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:10,220
with so this this type of situation

00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:12,650
where if there was ever a problem with a

00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:14,240
website most of the problem was finding

00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:15,980
it well okay what does it actually built

00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,480
with where is it hosted who's our

00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:19,640
contact how do we get in touch with them

00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:21,700
so this wasn't a valuable business

00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:23,690
process certainly not in the long run so

00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:27,080
something had to be done so I've talked

00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:30,140
about and make sure got it all here yeah

00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:31,520
so what the overriding target of this

00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:33,620
process for Columbia was to come up with

00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:35,060
a single nectar ring somebody whose job

00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:36,410
was to say hey this website is not

00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:38,000
working or hey we need to get some work

00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:40,550
done this website who's the person we

00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,230
can talk to so that that was the process

00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:43,930
that's the so i guess the backstory to

00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:48,560
how this process needed to be and

00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:50,720
conducted so we'll move on sure so as

00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:52,400
alan said we were working with numerous

00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,500
different platforms we needed to gain

00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:56,660
some sort of control and create a

00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:59,120
standard for a current sites and most

00:10:56,660 --> 00:11:00,890
importantly for future bills and just to

00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:04,070
have that standard in place and a

00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:05,780
process to display to the business so as

00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:07,640
part of this we had to review all

00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:09,080
current platforms and if

00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:11,300
you other platforms that the businesses

00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:14,240
may have heard from other businesses etc

00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:17,210
so just to name a few which some we do

00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:19,370
still currently use so adobe joomla site

00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:21,680
core magento Hybris high versus Allen

00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:23,390
said as well we still use within Glanbia

00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,430
but more for the complex fighter things

00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:28,730
where we're displaying information from

00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:30,800
sa p for example so as part of this

00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:33,320
literally we went back to basics

00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:35,360
creating comparison tables going back to

00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:37,820
the business showing what what each

00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:40,820
platform could do along with demos in

00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:42,410
some cases then we could then we created

00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:44,390
a list of requirements okay so for a

00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:46,580
multinational company what did we

00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:49,790
require as a standard as a standard

00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:52,370
platform for a CMS capability and also

00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:54,830
we needed to ensure that it would be

00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:56,950
evolving with glanbia so as you can see

00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:59,660
Colombia is quite a large organization

00:11:56,950 --> 00:12:02,180
sites are being built left right and

00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:04,610
center so we need some control over that

00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:07,490
and sites are constantly being being

00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:10,400
requested and as they were previously as

00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:12,860
the air now and so we jumped on board so

00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:15,230
one we need a scalable platform that

00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:16,880
again was ever evolving we had to we had

00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:18,620
to future-proof it somewhere we had to

00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:21,710
see that it that it would evolve with

00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:23,810
Glanbia as well and again just little

00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:27,380
things like multilingual and just moving

00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:30,050
forward constantly and also very

00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:31,880
importantly it had to be intuitive so we

00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:33,560
were tired of dealing with all numerous

00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:36,500
agencies and having such restricted

00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:38,330
access and to make such a small amend

00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:40,850
having to raise a change request to do

00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:43,100
something so simple and we needed more

00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:44,900
control here we needed some some

00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:46,070
intuitive CMS where it could be handed

00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:47,660
over to the business if they needed to

00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:49,400
make a small content immense which an

00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:51,650
image we wanted that to be an easy

00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:53,210
process and also within our own team

00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:55,310
digital media to have the capability to

00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:58,100
carry out certain requests and Drupal

00:12:55,310 --> 00:13:00,290
gave that intuitiveness and simplicity I

00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:04,730
thought Drupal was a very transparent

00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:07,880
area and so as a scalable intuitive and

00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:09,830
also as I mentioned as well we were

00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:11,810
looking towards the hosting so we want

00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:14,360
to implement it we want to implement a

00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:17,960
treat here environment so a dev a quoz

00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:20,900
and a production so lots of our previous

00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:21,590
CMS platforms it was very unclear how it

00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:24,050
all worked it

00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:25,730
very blurred of how the hosting and the

00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:27,140
site worked where did you make a change

00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:29,210
you'd have to make a change on test

00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:30,800
first and then move it to prod there was

00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:35,000
no process there we really needed a

00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:37,100
clear and structure path there so true

00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,290
out the review Drupal did match all of

00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:41,840
those qualifications plus more and as I

00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:44,240
said it seemed a lot more simplistic and

00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:47,720
clear on what to do just in terms of

00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:49,610
modules and configuration and also the

00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:51,350
ability to create further modules if

00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:54,020
there was something complex required and

00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:56,360
the CMS was of particular interest

00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:58,910
especially from the business just for

00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:01,160
the ease of content men's etc and also

00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:02,870
that multilingual capability which was

00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:04,490
also very easy to maintain and the back

00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:06,980
end it could easily be handed over the

00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:09,170
business with minimal training and but

00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:11,990
however Drupal did match everything but

00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:13,580
what it lacked was visibility so in a

00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:15,830
corporate world where decisions are

00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:19,190
actually signed off no one had heard of

00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:20,810
Drupal I feel like people thought it was

00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:23,060
something like WordPress is it even

00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:25,130
enterprise-e who uses it we would not

00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:28,310
just use something we already have we

00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:31,010
can manipulate current platforms etc and

00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:33,020
it was extremely extremely hard just to

00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:34,790
get the visibility and credibility out

00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:36,950
there even though it was so obvious it

00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:38,690
could do all these amazing things the

00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:40,190
business were even happy with it they

00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:41,990
could they could see they could make

00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:44,510
amends clearly they understood the

00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:47,900
process and so we then dog a bit further

00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:49,550
and we looked into the hosting so Aria

00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:52,880
came up with which essentially

00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:55,490
bubble-wrapped and Drupal itself and so

00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:58,310
Acquia did implement that and build test

00:14:55,490 --> 00:15:00,470
deploy approach it had that corporate

00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:02,150
feel maybe it was just down to marketing

00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:05,210
but it did have that corporate field

00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:06,920
which just signed off Drupal that that's

00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:09,370
really what the selling point was it

00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:12,650
bubble wrapped all of Drupal as well

00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:14,300
aquia was also very intuitive like like

00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:16,400
drupal very transparent of what was

00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:17,930
going on so a lot of us working on the

00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:20,030
digital media team and even within glam

00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:23,540
beer not all of us would be that

00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:25,370
technical so it was very easy to see how

00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:27,320
things worked and we were able to

00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:30,140
understand the process and end of how it

00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:32,060
would work and Acquia just in terms of

00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:34,760
creating the environment environment

00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:35,390
itself uploading an ssl cert it all just

00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,980
took a number

00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:39,020
of minutes and we could do that all

00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:42,260
internally which is a very very

00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:44,570
simplistic approach so that really did

00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:46,250
speak volumes and it signed off the

00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:49,700
process for Drupal which we have created

00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:50,960
as a standard so when I guess sort of

00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:52,730
slide segue to the presentation itself

00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:53,960
and talk about Acquia and drupal so I

00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:56,090
don't know if anyone's here from a

00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:57,410
career in the room and I was unlikely a

00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:58,640
partner day yesterday and I thought

00:15:57,410 --> 00:16:00,410
mentioned this talk is like an

00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:01,850
accidental sales pitch for a career and

00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:03,500
I wasn't meant like that and to dance

00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:05,120
with you the lessons that you can take

00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:07,400
away from this can be applied to to

00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:09,560
various other large supporting platforms

00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,730
but in it the point I'm trying to make

00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:12,110
here is that from a glum be your

00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:14,090
perspective there is no differentiation

00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:17,570
between our three and rupal there is

00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:19,250
just there one thing like we had very

00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:20,930
interesting conversations early on our

00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:22,340
engagement with Zambia what we're here

00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:24,500
for oh yeah we were speaking to Drupal

00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:27,560
yesterday and they said I was like who

00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:28,730
who you talking to and no we're talking

00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,900
the Drupal they said yeah this is no

00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:32,900
problem you can just you know blow the

00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:35,210
ssl certain and eventually over time

00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:36,050
become to learn that as far as zombie

00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:38,570
are concerned there is no

00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:40,610
differentiation between our quadruple so

00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:42,080
as part of their research process and as

00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:44,570
part of basically how they do business

00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:46,970
they will not buy Drupal on its own they

00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:48,890
will only deal with a large corporate

00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:50,090
vendor and this is probably the biggest

00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:52,430
take on point from this entire

00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:54,140
presentation so this this is something

00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:55,130
you know it took us as a small group of

00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:56,840
company and as far as we're concerned

00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:58,520
we're the face of Drupal in Ireland this

00:16:56,840 --> 00:17:00,080
is a bit of a wake-up call to go well

00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:01,280
hang on yeah you're the weird the face

00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,900
of Drupal Ireland you've got you know

00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:04,940
core maintainer security team members

00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:06,949
etc etc but from a line to be a bear

00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:09,020
perspective that does not matter they do

00:17:06,949 --> 00:17:10,970
not care they want to deal with a large

00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:13,640
corporate entity that are going to be

00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:15,560
around in ten years time that are that

00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:17,480
are backed that are financially viable

00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:20,270
stable huge that deal with big companies

00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:23,510
and yeah this was a bit of a wake-up

00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:25,280
call first and so yeah it's the idea

00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:28,550
that that there it's all about dealing

00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:30,500
with a vendor not just a product I like

00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:32,570
we've got a really good product you know

00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:33,980
as a nanotech we sell Drupal we do a

00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:36,140
really good job of it but we're not a

00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:38,240
big vendor and what's interesting is

00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:40,910
that for this phase of the product ack

00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:42,620
we did a really good job and the scale

00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:44,990
that aqua iraq was just what the

00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:46,310
business needed as I sort of a okay yeah

00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:48,790
this there's a big company behind this

00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:49,930
they're dealing with bigger a bigger

00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:53,170
projects they know what they're doing

00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:55,440
it'd give a sense of extensive scale a

00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:57,640
sense of permanence importance that

00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:59,380
tambien needed in order to get Drupal

00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:00,880
over the line but what's interesting we

00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:02,920
look later on down the line is that a

00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:05,020
key themselves and by extension the

00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:07,240
Drupal community have a job to do in

00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:08,650
terms of still reaching the corporate

00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:11,200
boardroom level within a lot of agencies

00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:12,130
because well I monkey away the rest of

00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:16,420
my slides actually so we'll talk about

00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:21,220
that later on okay so yeah how do drupal

00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:24,190
nearly lose out and so make sure I've

00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:25,930
got all this right here yeah so yeah the

00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:27,910
difference is that when it came to make

00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:30,880
a decision one of the questions actually

00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:32,650
why aren't we just using Sitecore or why

00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,030
aren't we just using Adobe I don't get

00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:36,520
it why are we taking this product this

00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:38,410
platform acquia that I've never heard of

00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:40,210
that you know yeah okay they're dealing

00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:41,920
with NBC or whatever like that but you

00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:43,420
know the guy down the road in the other

00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:46,270
large multinational food companies

00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:47,740
they're not using this so why are we

00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:50,770
switching over to it and this this

00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:53,230
genuinely was a big problem so you know

00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:54,220
this I guess is a takeaway for a lot of

00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:55,810
different people but certainly within

00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:58,360
the people who are pitching to

00:18:55,810 --> 00:19:00,760
enterprise level clients this is far

00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:02,530
bigger a deal like thought that the role

00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:06,670
that emotion plays in making a decision

00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:07,750
I mean you know psychology and majors

00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:09,340
know all about this kind of stuff but

00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:10,810
for us it was still like well you know a

00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:11,950
lot of people here in the room come from

00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:13,960
a development background or at least I

00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:16,540
did and you know everything was

00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:18,010
evaluated based on the the capabilities

00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:19,900
of the product on water can do or the

00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:22,750
hosting platform or water can do but

00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:24,490
that that isn't enough I at a top level

00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:26,920
boardroom they're going on go to an

00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:28,270
emotion and if you can't play to that if

00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:29,980
you can't reassure people that they're

00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:31,690
making the right decision so you know

00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:34,270
the line that no one ever got fired for

00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:35,920
buying IBM was thrown around for years

00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:38,050
and you know that's kind of inertia

00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:42,880
still exists within a boardroom level

00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:45,190
and but what Drupal had in terms of its

00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:46,780
secret sauce you know it is a very good

00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:48,250
platform and it's just as good as the

00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:50,530
other platforms that are available and

00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:53,760
this you know can't be underestimated

00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:56,230
you know in terms of say the likes of I

00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:58,060
don't know wordpress joomla you know

00:19:56,230 --> 00:20:00,460
drupal at a corporate level still seen

00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:02,080
as a more reliable platform to deal with

00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:02,320
these kind of deal with problems that

00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:05,019
multi

00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:07,450
actions are playing are working with on

00:20:05,019 --> 00:20:09,490
a daily basis but I actually mentioned

00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:11,919
the idea that a clear command and bubble

00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:13,720
wrap Drupal this essentially was what

00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:16,960
the difference was in winning over drew

00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:18,700
pizazz a platform and yeah like I said

00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:21,130
an eye-opener for us but the idea that

00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:22,960
they can deal with a single vendor that

00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:25,620
looks after their hosting looks after

00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:29,230
their staging and QA environments and

00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:30,580
looks after the git repository hosting

00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:32,139
for example so all these little things

00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:33,669
are abundant as part of that platform

00:20:32,139 --> 00:20:36,009
this is very appealing from a corporate

00:20:33,669 --> 00:20:37,360
level perspective and it was it was

00:20:36,009 --> 00:20:39,370
definitely a huge part of the

00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:41,320
decision-making process use it was like

00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:42,580
a key thing to see is well that's what

00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:47,620
drupal's got that the other ones don't

00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:49,299
have and the what Drupal 8 I like we're

00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:50,769
using it a lot and we intend to make

00:20:49,299 --> 00:20:52,149
even more usable but there's a couple of

00:20:50,769 --> 00:20:53,440
things with in Drupal 8 that the other

00:20:52,149 --> 00:20:55,720
platforms haven't quite caught up with

00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:57,639
yet or at least not as well is certainly

00:20:55,720 --> 00:21:00,700
a configuration management Drupal's in a

00:20:57,639 --> 00:21:02,139
much better job of now and I won't say

00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:04,269
it was part of this evaluation because

00:21:02,139 --> 00:21:06,100
it wasn't but it's something that that's

00:21:04,269 --> 00:21:07,059
the kind of thing that a corporate level

00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:09,039
vendor is going to look for

00:21:07,059 --> 00:21:10,600
configuration management content staging

00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:12,519
again not part of this particular

00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:14,470
decision level process but that's a huge

00:21:12,519 --> 00:21:17,980
thing we were asked for content staging

00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:19,710
as long ago as six years ago or business

00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:23,159
partners and rooms you might remember

00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:25,450
yeah six years ago unlike you know

00:21:23,159 --> 00:21:26,620
meetings that go yeah we look into that

00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:28,929
and you run away and find out what the

00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:30,039
hell does content staging me so you find

00:21:28,929 --> 00:21:31,720
out what it means and then you find out

00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:32,830
yeah it can be done but it's really

00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:34,360
really tricky and really really

00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:35,620
complicated and does your budget stretch

00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:38,049
that far it is running the sort of time

00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:39,789
on it no okay that's parked we'll look

00:21:38,049 --> 00:21:41,080
at in later phase but that's something

00:21:39,789 --> 00:21:42,549
that's cropping up more and more again

00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:44,620
and a corporate level perspective to

00:21:42,549 --> 00:21:46,779
have that ability to have not just the

00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:48,309
configuration not just the functionality

00:21:46,779 --> 00:21:50,409
on a staging version but to have the

00:21:48,309 --> 00:21:52,450
content stage ready to go for a big

00:21:50,409 --> 00:21:55,299
meaty launch click the switch we're

00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:57,159
going live with a new platform a new set

00:21:55,299 --> 00:21:59,889
of content that's very appealing to a

00:21:57,159 --> 00:22:05,220
large corporates so we've been looking

00:21:59,889 --> 00:22:09,100
at projects like the deploy model and

00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:10,960
what's the Dixon season there's a pfizer

00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:13,120
in the UK or doing a lot of work on this

00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:14,830
so basically they this is some day they

00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,150
really need as well again another large

00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:17,680
multinational with thousands

00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:19,570
and thousands of sites but the ability

00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:21,250
to push content like that is seen as it

00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:22,480
as a big deal for them so they've been

00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:24,820
working very hard on that and there's

00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:26,650
been various additions to the Drupal and

00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:28,120
so the walls just the module called

00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:29,470
deploy now there's like a suite of five

00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:30,670
or six modules that work together things

00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:33,010
like multi version and things like that

00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:34,840
so that's something we see has been very

00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:36,250
important we're trying to get to grips

00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:38,140
with it gets stuck in with that kind of

00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:39,550
work so that when requests come up the

00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:41,590
next time from a corporate lincoln hey

00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:43,540
what about content engine yet no problem

00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:44,650
here's how we don't so that's where

00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:46,000
we're moving to and that's the kind of

00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:47,020
thing if you want to make sure these

00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,610
things this the kind of stuff that

00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:49,930
people are looking for and the point is

00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:51,610
the tuple can do it I'm going to do it

00:22:49,930 --> 00:22:58,450
really really well especially in the

00:22:51,610 --> 00:23:00,300
newest version so yeah and so after a

00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:03,220
lot of research numerous meetings

00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:05,290
comparison tables having plenty of

00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:07,780
meetings with a CLIA and allen and his

00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:10,330
team and we took about three months all

00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:13,180
in all to select drupal and aquia as a

00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:15,060
platform to go with with in colombia so

00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:18,130
at that point we had made two decisions

00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:20,620
we were going to have we're going to

00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:23,050
have drupal and aqua as our standard CMS

00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:25,270
platform but also stick with Hybris just

00:23:23,050 --> 00:23:27,100
for are more complex side of things in

00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:28,780
the in the house for example we have a

00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:31,660
cycle Glanbia connect with which

00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:33,550
displays all milk data from sa p so we

00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:36,370
would stick with hybrids for that sector

00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:38,440
okay so within three months that's not a

00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:40,540
long time we already had two sites in

00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:42,490
the backlog within digital media which

00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:44,500
we which we knew we're going to be built

00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:46,240
on Drupal and at this point what we were

00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:47,980
saying to the businesses this is the

00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:49,810
only option this is a standard we have

00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:52,330
said in place and this is this is the Y

00:23:49,810 --> 00:23:54,760
which was much appreciated by the

00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:56,440
business and there was no there was no

00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:58,270
conflict or queries both switching

00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:59,740
platforms once we provided everything

00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:02,290
that was there and was signed off as

00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:04,270
well by corporate so the first site we

00:24:02,290 --> 00:24:06,430
went live with Drupal was both this time

00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:10,120
last year Glanbia ingredients Ireland

00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:12,850
and we built that on Drupal 7 so that is

00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:15,190
a b2b space and just to give a small bit

00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:17,290
of context and Glanbia ingredients

00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:20,170
Ireland is Ireland's largest dairy

00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:22,660
provider so it processes about 2 billion

00:24:20,170 --> 00:24:24,490
litres of milk annually and that's

00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:26,260
converted into numerous dairy products

00:24:24,490 --> 00:24:28,540
for the sports performance nutrition

00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:29,400
sector and also clinical it ranges from

00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:33,050
me

00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:35,910
tube or sure to cheese again and also to

00:24:33,050 --> 00:24:37,620
nutrition products and so glam beer

00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:40,530
ingredients Ireland had little to no

00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:42,870
online presence previously the business

00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:46,320
really wanted a content-rich site and

00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:47,700
also how that corporate feel and as well

00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:49,950
the business one to the capability to

00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:52,290
amend and edit content simple things

00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:55,020
like switcher images which wasn't so

00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:57,900
simple in the past and Drupal was able

00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:59,690
to handle all of these capabilities as

00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:02,100
well they wanted to future-proof

00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:03,390
future-proof the site as we know as we

00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:05,220
know that this site is going to grow

00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:07,620
just into further markets such as China

00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:09,300
etc so we knew that Drupal could cater

00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:12,150
for this in the future when we get to it

00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:13,380
that was the first site and the second

00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:15,390
site with which we were actually

00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:17,700
building pretty much in parallel was

00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:19,710
also built on Drupal 7 called food

00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:21,930
escapes nutrition this is a company

00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:23,850
based in the US and it was a new

00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:27,300
business unit and that just set up

00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:29,910
recently last year and basically it is a

00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:32,040
lunchtime school program for primary

00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:34,110
schools within the US the main objective

00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:36,030
of of this site really was just have a

00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:39,180
point of reference for the primary

00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:41,130
schools themselves and the this site was

00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:44,040
to display a relatively small portfolio

00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:45,900
of products launches and recipes now

00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:47,850
this site was particularly interesting

00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:49,620
as we worked very closely with ana tech

00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:51,540
who actually trained you'll see an end

00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:53,580
to end just with the build and

00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:55,440
configuration of the site so that was

00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:58,560
absolutely excellent cause us as a team

00:25:55,440 --> 00:26:01,740
we got to see how Drupal was configured

00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:03,900
how to download upload modules etc even

00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:06,960
just from the environment perspective

00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:09,030
using gish version control it was very

00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:11,190
clear the standards and processes even

00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:13,560
from a coding perspective that had to be

00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:15,150
set in place so that has been a huge

00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:17,160
learning curve and also makes it easier

00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:18,990
to go back and explain to the business

00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:21,120
say for example if change request comes

00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:23,190
in we have a rough idea of what's

00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:25,920
feasible or not and then we we work

00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:29,310
together to resolve and so that was a

00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:31,800
very very exciting opportunity and then

00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:33,810
our most recent and go life is Glanbia

00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:36,870
nutritionals that was built this year

00:26:33,810 --> 00:26:38,940
went live about July and was built on

00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:40,590
Drupal 8 so as I was talking earlier

00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:43,270
just in the back story of Lambie

00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:45,250
nutritionals it is a very very complex

00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:47,200
business unit and as I said it's

00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:49,030
compromised of tree business units which

00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:51,430
actually joined together around the time

00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:53,140
of goal life so there was an enormous

00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:55,270
amount of content that had to be

00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:57,310
displayed along with numerous different

00:26:55,270 --> 00:26:59,740
and business units and points of

00:26:57,310 --> 00:27:01,720
contacts that would all require certain

00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:04,180
permissions on the site to edit and

00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:08,230
amend their areas so rule permission was

00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:09,640
a big thing here again I think the main

00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:11,830
challenge with this site it was that it

00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:13,870
would have to be a content-rich site but

00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:16,030
it was more offline so there was so much

00:27:13,870 --> 00:27:19,500
content we needed to find a way to

00:27:16,030 --> 00:27:22,450
display that and in an intuitive way and

00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:24,700
again with an Drupal one of our key

00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:27,100
points within a CMS was that we wanted a

00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:28,870
flexible platform we don't want all of

00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:30,700
our future glanbia sites to look the

00:27:28,870 --> 00:27:31,780
same and have the same template but

00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:34,540
Drupal allows us to have that

00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:36,550
flexibility so say for example within

00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:40,030
this site we have numerous product

00:27:36,550 --> 00:27:41,710
solutions and categories and each each

00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:43,600
category solution would have a detail

00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:45,040
page we didn't want all these pages to

00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:47,800
look the same because the content would

00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:49,450
have varied such a huge amount so within

00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:51,610
this and drupal gave us the capability

00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:52,840
to have different different content

00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:55,060
types on different pages so say for

00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:57,130
example we'd use the accordion we'd use

00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:59,080
the lids the list approach the tabbing

00:27:57,130 --> 00:28:02,200
approach and again we could add and

00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:03,700
subtract this as we went along and say

00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:05,500
for example this week if a new park are

00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:06,820
added a new tab needed to be amended new

00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:10,450
accordion it is very very

00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:13,330
straightforward to add in and so Drupal

00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:15,790
really did give us a lot of flexibility

00:28:13,330 --> 00:28:17,560
here just to have a nicely designed and

00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:19,630
intuitive site for the business we've

00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:22,650
nice little mega menu drop-down with

00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:24,580
some icons it was it was in pretty

00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:27,100
intuitive site so the business were

00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:29,440
extremely happy and again with three new

00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:32,710
business units joining together the

00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:35,350
royal permission was was was very very

00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:37,210
important so the business are extremely

00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:39,280
happy that they have they still have

00:28:37,210 --> 00:28:41,790
their ownership of their content and

00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:45,640
they can change things as they go and

00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:47,560
then just the next course so future

00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:49,000
plans for Drupal even though we just

00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:50,170
went through a few bits about the Lumbee

00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,970
and green such as I'll just add to that

00:28:50,170 --> 00:28:53,320
so it's been extremely an extremely

00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:55,270
successful project and there's a couple

00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:56,870
of reasons why so the first one is it

00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:58,280
was built in Drupal 8 so it

00:28:56,870 --> 00:29:00,080
most much better platform to work with

00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:01,940
in terms of meeting some of the

00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:03,080
requirements of Columbia but a few of

00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:04,640
the things that we learned then over the

00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:06,440
course the year as to how lumbia

00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,970
functions as the business we will put

00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:09,770
that into practice in terms of

00:29:07,970 --> 00:29:12,280
developing that site so learning how

00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:14,180
like roles and report roles permissions

00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:15,770
segmented sections of the site that

00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:17,210
different people could edit you know

00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:18,920
these kind of requirements as we've

00:29:17,210 --> 00:29:20,750
learned as we worked with them just

00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:21,830
within the third large project so

00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:23,120
learning these things over the course

00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:24,710
the air meant that we could put solution

00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:26,180
to place now rather than stuff that we

00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:28,460
say I don't on a various points in time

00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:30,140
as various change requests came true so

00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:31,970
we're you know that was a really good

00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:33,710
project from our perspective as well you

00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:35,660
know things that we learned both about

00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:37,580
about about Columbia and how it does

00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:40,070
things or large corporates and how do

00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:42,020
they do things how Drupal 8 will let us

00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:43,160
do better things and these things came

00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:45,110
together produce a really really good

00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:47,110
side and when we're very proud of and is

00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:50,000
up for an award tomorrow night at the

00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:51,110
what the Irish Web Awards I know I think

00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,130
it's been nominated for a few different

00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:53,720
but the Irish were wars on tomorrow

00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:55,460
night so we're hopefully will come away

00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:56,900
with something from Nash so yeah we're

00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:59,600
very happy with that and I think it also

00:29:56,900 --> 00:30:00,770
lets us you know from a from analytics

00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,030
perspective it puts it in a very good

00:30:00,770 --> 00:30:03,950
place now an extremely successful

00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:06,230
project they'll turn a modern CMS

00:30:03,950 --> 00:30:08,330
platform that we can use as at the

00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:10,160
inside sales point for various other

00:30:08,330 --> 00:30:12,920
projects with within the organization

00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:14,840
and as well just to note this is the

00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:16,880
first time that the business actually

00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:19,429
have controlled to amend their content

00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:21,470
so usually our platforms are so I saw

00:30:19,429 --> 00:30:22,910
bespoke that they'd have to hand it over

00:30:21,470 --> 00:30:25,070
to us to make a change or they just

00:30:22,910 --> 00:30:27,020
asked us to take care of it but now the

00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:29,179
business can actually go in and make the

00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:31,010
changes themselves I think with Drupal

00:30:29,179 --> 00:30:33,320
they do feel a lot more included with

00:30:31,010 --> 00:30:35,090
the process because we do have a process

00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:37,490
to explain to them end to end of how it

00:30:35,090 --> 00:30:39,320
works even from the dev testing and

00:30:37,490 --> 00:30:41,540
production environment when we were in

00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:43,520
the middle of you 80 and they were very

00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:46,130
much so involved and are extremely happy

00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:47,840
to be involved in just simple things

00:30:46,130 --> 00:30:51,410
like the updating process which wasn't

00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:54,410
done before and so then the next course

00:30:51,410 --> 00:30:56,540
just the future of Drupal within glanbia

00:30:54,410 --> 00:30:58,670
so even though glanbia nutritionals has

00:30:56,540 --> 00:31:01,010
just gone live we are already kicking

00:30:58,670 --> 00:31:04,130
off into phase 2 so it is an

00:31:01,010 --> 00:31:05,929
international b2b site so far phase two

00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:08,570
which we are currently smoking out

00:31:05,929 --> 00:31:10,250
offline and we will have to incorporate

00:31:08,570 --> 00:31:10,370
that internationalization which is going

00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:12,230
to

00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:15,830
quite big so we'll have a multilingual

00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:18,290
capability geolocation and also we'll

00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:20,600
need to have some sort of products which

00:31:18,290 --> 00:31:22,610
are cuz not all products are going to be

00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:24,590
available in certain regions so that's a

00:31:22,610 --> 00:31:29,059
pretty big project which we are fleshing

00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:31,130
out at the moment and then also which we

00:31:29,059 --> 00:31:34,040
are looking into extremely closely for

00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:36,590
our future b2c and b2b projects is the

00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:39,800
recent am Drupal to Hybris integration

00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:41,870
so this is extremely attractive so as I

00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:43,520
said we do use Hybris just for the more

00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:46,090
complex sites at the moment that are

00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:48,530
feeding in from our main system sap and

00:31:46,090 --> 00:31:50,540
but with that Drupal to hybrids

00:31:48,530 --> 00:31:52,610
integration what we are thinking as a

00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:54,920
company is that we could use Drupal as

00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:57,559
the presentation there again given that

00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:59,450
flexibility as we don't have to stick to

00:31:57,559 --> 00:32:01,460
a number of templates etc so just from

00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:03,380
moving forward again for fear of all our

00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:04,820
sites looking the same and just adhering

00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:06,920
to business requirements as closely as

00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:08,630
possible this is proving very attractive

00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:10,010
which we are looking into a lot and

00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:12,470
doing a lot of research into at the

00:32:10,010 --> 00:32:14,240
moment yeah so this this is very

00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:16,220
interesting again from a Drupal

00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:18,230
community perspective so when I first

00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:19,970
talked to Don be about maybe 18 months

00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:21,500
ago when they were evaluating Drupal it

00:32:19,970 --> 00:32:23,360
was very much oh no this is just for a

00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:25,340
brochure where sites you know we've got

00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:26,600
asap we've got hybrids that's we're

00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:28,040
going to use for the complex sites for

00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:30,500
the ecommerce sites it wasn't even

00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:31,970
considered and I know this took me back

00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:33,710
a bit because we would see drupal's

00:32:31,970 --> 00:32:35,840
expertise as being in the corporate in

00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:37,190
the complex I'd spaces and and we would

00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:38,750
be surprised that it would be even

00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:40,010
competitive within the brochure where

00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:41,690
sites but then you know we dig a bit

00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:43,160
deeper and it turns out that behind the

00:32:41,690 --> 00:32:44,780
scenes even the brochure sites within

00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:48,230
the corporate context have an awful lot

00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:49,490
of functionality they require so and you

00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:51,800
know Drupal is proven it's worth it's a

00:32:49,490 --> 00:32:53,870
reliable platform a couple of successes

00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:56,000
within the company and you know perhaps

00:32:53,870 --> 00:32:57,710
at one level we'd like to build a couple

00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,630
of more projects at this level so

00:32:57,710 --> 00:33:00,800
complex corporate marketing sites so we

00:32:59,630 --> 00:33:02,510
can learn more and more about the

00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:03,620
business get a bit more traction within

00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:06,110
the site but it's been so successful

00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:08,540
that it's now been evaluated at a you

00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:10,610
know what the truth is a level above the

00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:12,290
digital media team are now deciding hey

00:33:10,610 --> 00:33:14,720
that's are we going to go with Drupal or

00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:16,850
are we going to go with sitecore or

00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:18,770
Adobe and this is a big corporate level

00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:20,630
decision that they will be dealing with

00:33:18,770 --> 00:33:22,730
large vendors in terms of multi-year

00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:24,490
contracts and all this kind of stuff so

00:33:22,730 --> 00:33:26,870
this you know

00:33:24,490 --> 00:33:30,140
this is not a game that I know tech can

00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:32,570
play you know we don't have 1.5 million

00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:34,130
in a marketing budget or seven million

00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:35,900
or whatever the hell it is that Adobe

00:33:34,130 --> 00:33:38,600
have in a marketing budget you know we

00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:40,760
can't fly people over to Wisconsin to

00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:42,890
meet the various executives in Colombia

00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:45,049
USS USA cheese division you know we're

00:33:42,890 --> 00:33:46,549
just not have that scale so we're this

00:33:45,049 --> 00:33:47,570
but but at the same point and the point

00:33:46,549 --> 00:33:50,390
I'm trying to make is Drupal is

00:33:47,570 --> 00:33:52,580
competing at this level and Drupal chops

00:33:50,390 --> 00:33:54,320
at our level can be involved in those

00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:55,909
processes as well if you choose the

00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:57,590
right partners so from our perspective

00:33:55,909 --> 00:34:00,080
you know we can't scale up to be a

00:33:57,590 --> 00:34:02,149
massive 500 company 500-person company

00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:03,860
overnight but what we can use is that we

00:34:02,149 --> 00:34:05,390
have appropriate partners for

00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:08,030
appropriate projects we can get involved

00:34:05,390 --> 00:34:09,500
in those projects as well so it's a very

00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:12,139
complex scenario from our perspective

00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:13,790
because a woman's we are working with

00:34:12,139 --> 00:34:16,520
lumpy on a closed space were not their

00:34:13,790 --> 00:34:17,869
only vendor available for them to get

00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:20,480
web sites built out like essentially

00:34:17,869 --> 00:34:22,099
mentioned and they will go directly to

00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:23,690
other agencies they get still get

00:34:22,099 --> 00:34:24,919
wordpress site spun up because the

00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:26,540
independent business units will go to

00:34:24,919 --> 00:34:28,730
them or even if they don't have the

00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:30,109
capability and house they're going to do

00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:32,300
it as well but we're working closely

00:34:30,109 --> 00:34:33,589
that the term is an in-house business

00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:36,290
partner so we're trying to work with

00:34:33,589 --> 00:34:38,210
them to develop new projects because the

00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:40,070
digital media team is almost like an

00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:41,629
agency they see requirements they see

00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:43,250
needs for different units to have

00:34:41,629 --> 00:34:44,839
different problem solved or sites

00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:46,310
updated so they're working with us hey

00:34:44,839 --> 00:34:47,659
do you think we could solve something

00:34:46,310 --> 00:34:49,220
for these guys what would you recommend

00:34:47,659 --> 00:34:51,020
have you got some ideas and we work with

00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:52,790
them to put together they're not quite

00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:56,179
joint proposals but they're there in the

00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:58,609
same area and but then at the corporate

00:34:56,179 --> 00:35:01,010
level it's different you know you know

00:34:58,609 --> 00:35:02,270
we're just not at that level just yet so

00:35:01,010 --> 00:35:03,650
what we're trying to do is get involved

00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:05,599
with a qui and support them as much as

00:35:03,650 --> 00:35:07,760
we can in terms of that particular pitch

00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:09,109
for the next level product so this is a

00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:10,520
bit of a catch-22 for us because you

00:35:09,109 --> 00:35:11,660
know we're not actually as only partner

00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:14,180
they could choose to go off to another

00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:16,550
company if they do win that that large

00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:18,500
and long term project to provide

00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:20,300
corporate level stuff but I mean our

00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:23,300
take on ax was this that basically it's

00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:25,820
better Drupal than into the adobe number

00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:28,280
one so it was worth helping out Acquia

00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:30,380
for just that because if it is one if

00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:32,180
it's another big Irish brand choosing

00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:33,530
Drupal we will eventually Bennifer

00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:35,710
benefit from but one way or the other

00:35:33,530 --> 00:35:37,580
but the other way to look at is that

00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:39,710
ultimately a free ad oh

00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:41,480
get other partners to work on them in

00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:43,040
various projects and we'd like to think

00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:44,270
that if we're able to help seal a deal

00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:46,160
like that that we're going to get some

00:35:44,270 --> 00:35:48,860
of that work as well so that's our

00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:50,930
that's our approach honest and we're

00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:52,100
happy that it's well that thought

00:35:50,930 --> 00:35:54,230
process is ongoing it's going to take

00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:55,730
quite a while for lumbia to make that

00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:56,900
decision and you know even the fruits of

00:35:55,730 --> 00:35:59,600
it in terms of the first sides been

00:35:56,900 --> 00:36:00,890
rolled out and that's a bit away yet but

00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:02,240
we're quite hopeful but and hopefully in

00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:04,280
the meantime we can get more and more

00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:06,110
sites built and demonstrate more success

00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:09,530
with it with Drupal as a platform within

00:36:06,110 --> 00:36:11,090
the glum BIA and site itself so that

00:36:09,530 --> 00:36:14,750
pretty much wraps up the talking part of

00:36:11,090 --> 00:36:15,890
the presentation and the standard slides

00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:18,740
they want us to talk about is this

00:36:15,890 --> 00:36:20,660
contribution Sprint's on friday at

00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:22,820
various places though basically the

00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:24,170
point that and you know how somebody's

00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:25,310
been involved in these prints there is

00:36:24,170 --> 00:36:27,260
room for everybody these prints

00:36:25,310 --> 00:36:29,420
regardless of your level or knowledge of

00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:30,860
Drupal and if there is anything at all

00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:32,480
that has annoyed you about Drupal and

00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:34,280
you can explain the problem to somebody

00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:36,590
that's a huge contribution in and of

00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:38,990
itself so you know something as simple

00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:40,730
as I really really hated the first time

00:36:38,990 --> 00:36:42,440
you install Drupal that that standard

00:36:40,730 --> 00:36:44,660
landing pages that's there and suddenly

00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:46,340
disappears as soon as you add an item a

00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:48,290
content that I don't get so even be able

00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:49,940
to explain something small like that you

00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:52,130
know it is a huge contribution this room

00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:53,300
for everybody and the very bottom I'd

00:36:52,130 --> 00:36:54,710
like to invite you all on to trivia

00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:56,540
night and Harry's noise I'll be the

00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:59,450
emcee for trivia night the quiz masters

00:36:56,540 --> 00:37:00,710
in there in the fourth row I shall put

00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:03,530
together all the questions so that's a

00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:05,060
lot of fun very informal I so come along

00:37:03,530 --> 00:37:06,350
and say hello to have a bit of fun under

00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:07,760
thurs night it's and for those who are

00:37:06,350 --> 00:37:09,590
from dumb it's going to be in the

00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:11,630
mansion house so it's a fantastic venue

00:37:09,590 --> 00:37:14,230
and if nothing else is worth going along

00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:17,000
to have a look at the venue itself and

00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:18,560
yeah next things will you do need we do

00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,780
need you guys to evaluate this session

00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:22,850
so a good batter and different learns

00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:24,650
know what you thought is there something

00:37:22,850 --> 00:37:25,910
that you would like to see more of is

00:37:24,650 --> 00:37:27,920
there stuff you felt was lacking from

00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:31,460
this presentation obviously prefer for

00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:32,900
maybe told us that face-to-face and yeah

00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:34,100
that's pretty much it so thanks very

00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:35,810
much for your time we're going to take

00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:37,040
questions there is a microphone here in

00:37:35,810 --> 00:37:38,540
the middle so if you just want to stand

00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:40,280
up in the microphone because they're

00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:41,930
going to record the audio and playback

00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:44,690
so that's why we want people at the

00:37:41,930 --> 00:37:47,510
microphone thank you for everything and

00:37:44,690 --> 00:37:49,760
just a real quick one that award-winning

00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:51,560
Drupal 8 site that you mention was this

00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:54,480
glanbia new

00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:56,250
yep okay so that was that was what World

00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:58,050
War did it win Oh didn't win the words

00:37:56,250 --> 00:37:59,670
in nomination it's examine okay that's

00:37:58,050 --> 00:38:01,109
great the wards are tomorrow night yeah

00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:02,670
okay let's create a nice tank maybe

00:38:01,109 --> 00:38:04,770
maybe an award-winning website by

00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:06,359
Thursday morning it's good it's good

00:38:04,770 --> 00:38:15,570
it's good progress in either case enter

00:38:06,359 --> 00:38:17,339
Thanks any other questions JP cycled all

00:38:15,570 --> 00:38:19,890
the way here I saw any breath left

00:38:17,339 --> 00:38:22,800
that's why I'm walking for me haven't

00:38:19,890 --> 00:38:24,660
recovered yet and so I'm aware that

00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:26,130
anateck were a very early adopter of of

00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:29,430
Drupal 8 that put you in a good position

00:38:26,130 --> 00:38:32,040
to use that as a as a platform for this

00:38:29,430 --> 00:38:33,420
I guess that you were quite early to it

00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:35,790
with this we were there was a lot of

00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:38,790
customizations and was that do you say

00:38:35,790 --> 00:38:39,930
within this print button okay so there's

00:38:38,790 --> 00:38:42,210
two different sort of questions here so

00:38:39,930 --> 00:38:44,160
if the first question is did our use of

00:38:42,210 --> 00:38:45,750
Drupal 8 helpers for this particular

00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:50,550
project I'm gonna be honest here

00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:53,310
probably not you know as a project um it

00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:54,300
may it's not fair I look at how to help

00:38:53,310 --> 00:38:55,800
and so wat you know we've been using

00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:57,810
Drupal 8 for a couple years now we've

00:38:55,800 --> 00:39:00,210
had our own website on Drupal 8 since I

00:38:57,810 --> 00:39:04,260
also to Amsterdam so almost two years

00:39:00,210 --> 00:39:05,580
now we've had um you know with people

00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:06,960
who've been involved in developing

00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:08,130
Drupal 8 for quite a long time now so

00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:10,260
when it came to switching over to that

00:39:08,130 --> 00:39:12,060
project it wasn't something new to them

00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:13,710
I was like okay great I finally get to

00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:16,410
build a website with this thing so there

00:39:13,710 --> 00:39:18,720
was a level of enthusiasm and you know I

00:39:16,410 --> 00:39:20,910
i guess the few kinks that were there at

00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:23,280
the time and they were already a

00:39:20,910 --> 00:39:25,650
familiar with them and be you had to

00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:27,300
deal with them so yeah maven bit unfair

00:39:25,650 --> 00:39:28,770
maybe it was a bit of an advantage to be

00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:30,060
able to go with a website on Drupal 8

00:39:28,770 --> 00:39:32,820
that early because we had you know

00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:34,320
knowledge of the platform actually maybe

00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:36,780
not for real website short of our own

00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:38,430
website but yeah I definitely i guess it

00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:40,380
would have helped you guess contrib was

00:39:38,430 --> 00:39:42,300
quite sparse quite early on as well so

00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:44,310
do you know okay well I mean ok so we're

00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:45,570
definitely a good space there at least

00:39:44,310 --> 00:39:47,420
within an Irish context with plenty of

00:39:45,570 --> 00:39:49,740
people on board who when it comes to a

00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:51,119
module that isn't ready we can jump in

00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:53,550
and write the patches right the upgrade

00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:55,109
path or whatever it takes so that didn't

00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:57,240
scarce and citizens carriers in terms of

00:39:55,109 --> 00:39:59,070
projects with to appellate because we've

00:39:57,240 --> 00:40:00,510
we've we've got some pictures of the

00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:01,800
moment where we going I don't know have

00:40:00,510 --> 00:40:03,119
we pitched tuple seven but certainly

00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:04,690
it's been approached to us say hey we

00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:06,550
want you to build a sand Rupert seven

00:40:04,690 --> 00:40:08,290
and and we're we're already and i

00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:09,520
genuinely mean we're already scared at

00:40:08,290 --> 00:40:12,160
the thought of building a site in Drupal

00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:14,500
7 because for us we moved on you know

00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:16,690
we're warts-and-all Drupal 8 is fire in

00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:17,829
a way better as a platform and I would

00:40:16,690 --> 00:40:20,079
encourage anyone we're still sort of

00:40:17,829 --> 00:40:23,560
sticking sticking with the happy safe

00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:24,910
space of a Drupal 7 site that they know

00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:26,950
inside out they can spin up sides really

00:40:24,910 --> 00:40:28,900
quickly that's going to that'll work for

00:40:26,950 --> 00:40:31,119
a certain amount of time but you know

00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:32,950
the learning curve that is there you'll

00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:34,780
have to overcome eventually and i

00:40:32,950 --> 00:40:36,550
genuinely think that once you get there

00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:38,109
you're in a much better space because

00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:39,730
like even i'll give you good example

00:40:38,109 --> 00:40:42,250
where that was a huge thing for us so

00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:44,079
within the Columbia project they're

00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:45,880
talking about okay we want our websites

00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:47,950
now you know can Drupal talk to hybrids

00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:49,810
and you know okay yeah course you can

00:40:47,950 --> 00:40:51,730
and now we know that because we got a

00:40:49,810 --> 00:40:53,410
much better API layer we've got restful

00:40:51,730 --> 00:40:54,670
services within core all these things

00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:56,530
are available that we can start using

00:40:54,670 --> 00:40:58,180
straight away so like without having

00:40:56,530 --> 00:40:59,829
like you know a hybrids module we can

00:40:58,180 --> 00:41:00,940
drag and drop and off you go we just

00:40:59,829 --> 00:41:03,069
know that in terms of writing some

00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:05,109
custom code or a custom service and

00:41:03,069 --> 00:41:06,130
interacts with that those things we just

00:41:05,109 --> 00:41:07,450
know that that's something that's going

00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:09,520
to be much more available out of the box

00:41:07,450 --> 00:41:11,290
without going okay to be as a service

00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:13,359
module or the rest of the u.s. module or

00:41:11,290 --> 00:41:14,650
the RESTful API module we just know we

00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:17,650
know that we can do it with Drupal core

00:41:14,650 --> 00:41:19,540
if we add on our own custom module stuff

00:41:17,650 --> 00:41:21,130
and look the nature of these projects is

00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:22,720
this custom code involved anyway like I

00:41:21,130 --> 00:41:24,280
actually talked about the way that the

00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:25,839
end of business the independent business

00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:27,700
units are very independent they want

00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:29,380
their own look and feel this isn't quite

00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:30,700
the same as i mentioned pfizer and

00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:32,140
people like that where they've got a

00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:33,940
corporate look or johnson Johnson

00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:35,380
downstairs there another example where

00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:36,970
there's a corporate look that has to

00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:39,760
adhere to across the whole platform and

00:41:36,970 --> 00:41:41,200
then the whole family this this is quite

00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:42,670
different these guys like they're

00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:44,859
competing with each other actually into

00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:46,960
three or four protein brands they're

00:41:44,859 --> 00:41:48,430
competing you know there's a lot of

00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:50,410
overlapping competition there you know

00:41:48,430 --> 00:41:51,430
they're in different spaces but there's

00:41:50,410 --> 00:41:53,589
a lot of overlap and they'll compete

00:41:51,430 --> 00:41:55,089
viciously so if you're told all your

00:41:53,589 --> 00:41:57,579
website's gonna look the same as this

00:41:55,089 --> 00:41:59,079
one that's just not going to fly suggest

00:41:57,579 --> 00:42:00,609
yeah yeah yeah it's a different space

00:41:59,079 --> 00:42:01,569
yeah you know different corporates will

00:42:00,609 --> 00:42:03,010
handle these things differently and

00:42:01,569 --> 00:42:05,020
that's that's currently I was going on

00:42:03,010 --> 00:42:06,250
you know the way things go over the

00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:07,420
corporate world it made my change over

00:42:06,250 --> 00:42:08,440
time they might decide to go you know

00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:09,369
what let's bring all these people in

00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:10,839
house let's come up with a single

00:42:09,369 --> 00:42:12,880
nutrition brandon and get rid of the

00:42:10,839 --> 00:42:14,470
other part are standardized on a single

00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:16,510
one these are decisions that you know

00:42:14,470 --> 00:42:17,829
people who look at spreadsheets and cash

00:42:16,510 --> 00:42:18,609
flow projections not kind of stuff they

00:42:17,829 --> 00:42:21,220
can make better

00:42:18,609 --> 00:42:27,519
that than I ever would cool oh jeez

00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:29,289
thanks to p.o the boss so I don't really

00:42:27,519 --> 00:42:32,259
have a question I just wanted to answer

00:42:29,289 --> 00:42:33,700
a point that you had tricky and in terms

00:42:32,259 --> 00:42:35,799
of custom developments in that site

00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:37,029
there wasn't a huge amount there is one

00:42:35,799 --> 00:42:38,710
custom module that we're going to

00:42:37,029 --> 00:42:41,109
contribute back to the community for the

00:42:38,710 --> 00:42:43,059
decision tree that's on the homepage I

00:42:41,109 --> 00:42:47,140
just haven't had time with Rupert on to

00:42:43,059 --> 00:42:48,309
to do that yet yeah so yeah there's a

00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:50,200
decision tree engine which is pretty

00:42:48,309 --> 00:42:53,829
nifty and it was built in such a way

00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:55,480
that a it can be contributed back as a

00:42:53,829 --> 00:42:57,880
computer module it's just the engine

00:42:55,480 --> 00:43:00,099
behind it works really well and be we're

00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:02,440
already planned user in the next site

00:43:00,099 --> 00:43:03,849
that we're going live with so that that

00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:05,499
functionality has you know it's been

00:43:03,849 --> 00:43:07,329
seen within the business units are sorry

00:43:05,499 --> 00:43:08,589
would buy another business econ hey that

00:43:07,329 --> 00:43:10,480
looks really cool could we use it for

00:43:08,589 --> 00:43:18,999
something on our site yeah we can do

00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:21,400
that my question is about the design

00:43:18,999 --> 00:43:24,849
part did you provide a design or there

00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:27,069
was another vendor so the digital media

00:43:24,849 --> 00:43:28,809
team yeah on top of that we have we have

00:43:27,069 --> 00:43:30,249
two ux and we also have a graphic

00:43:28,809 --> 00:43:32,559
designer within the digital media team

00:43:30,249 --> 00:43:34,630
so we worked very closely with an attack

00:43:32,559 --> 00:43:36,400
on the designs just to ensure it because

00:43:34,630 --> 00:43:37,900
we wore under tight deadlines with this

00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:40,210
project so we worked on the under

00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:41,349
designs internally or in Sprint's with

00:43:40,210 --> 00:43:43,720
an attack because if something was a

00:43:41,349 --> 00:43:45,880
 to complex under the deadline we

00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:47,499
just amended it slightly yeah this was

00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:49,599
my second question if there was no

00:43:47,499 --> 00:43:51,220
collaboration with it that's good yeah

00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:52,420
so the design process is just been

00:43:51,220 --> 00:43:54,069
fantastic for our perspective because

00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:55,390
this nut has not been a here's the

00:43:54,069 --> 00:43:56,499
designs throw them over the wall go

00:43:55,390 --> 00:43:58,960
billet it has not in our process

00:43:56,499 --> 00:44:00,220
whatsoever from the wireframe stage from

00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:01,839
the user requirement stage we've been

00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:03,670
involved so why we haven't actually been

00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:05,230
produced in the visuals ourselves we've

00:44:03,670 --> 00:44:07,239
been heavily involved to make sure that

00:44:05,230 --> 00:44:08,859
you know we you know a lot of times a

00:44:07,239 --> 00:44:10,210
design can go to different ways of one

00:44:08,859 --> 00:44:11,440
is going to be a very long way and very

00:44:10,210 --> 00:44:13,119
complex to implement one's gonna be

00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:15,130
trivial and we can just steer things in

00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:16,119
the right direction because I mean I

00:44:15,130 --> 00:44:18,640
don't know maybe all business are the

00:44:16,119 --> 00:44:21,609
same but the deadlines are challenging

00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:22,720
and you know how I've been challenging

00:44:21,609 --> 00:44:23,920
to deal with but you know we've got

00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:25,630
there but only because of the

00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:27,519
cooperation we've had you know I don't

00:44:25,630 --> 00:44:28,779
think that if we I mean short of doing

00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:30,549
the whole design process ourselves in

00:44:28,779 --> 00:44:32,380
house could we have met those because

00:44:30,549 --> 00:44:35,470
you know if we have to deal with another

00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:37,089
see who were very fixed on their design

00:44:35,470 --> 00:44:38,829
approach it wouldn't have worked but

00:44:37,089 --> 00:44:40,119
because we've had this cooperation this

00:44:38,829 --> 00:44:42,640
in-house business partnering that we've

00:44:40,119 --> 00:44:44,170
had in place it has worked and you know

00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:46,089
we've got the fruits to show for it to

00:44:44,170 --> 00:44:48,039
know you're lucky yeah we are an humble

00:44:46,089 --> 00:44:49,630
genuine and we sail all the time we know

00:44:48,039 --> 00:44:51,130
we're lucky you know we know that

00:44:49,630 --> 00:44:52,450
because look we've got other projects

00:44:51,130 --> 00:44:54,009
where that isn't the case where stuff is

00:44:52,450 --> 00:44:55,240
thrown over the wall and we're going

00:44:54,009 --> 00:44:57,700
well what does this do we've never seen

00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:58,809
this before you know have you any clear

00:44:57,700 --> 00:44:59,829
how this should work and then it goes

00:44:58,809 --> 00:45:01,509
back to something about I don't know

00:44:59,829 --> 00:45:02,980
I've never seen that and it's just it's

00:45:01,509 --> 00:45:05,140
entirely different process and we much

00:45:02,980 --> 00:45:07,569
prefer that the cooperative approach

00:45:05,140 --> 00:45:09,430
it's definitely I mean I think it'll be

00:45:07,569 --> 00:45:10,660
something we can in terms of future

00:45:09,430 --> 00:45:12,430
projects is going to work because we can

00:45:10,660 --> 00:45:14,470
show the timelines we can show this is

00:45:12,430 --> 00:45:16,029
how this went like that fast and it's

00:45:14,470 --> 00:45:17,890
only because it was a collaboration that

00:45:16,029 --> 00:45:19,269
what you know if we had to go okay here

00:45:17,890 --> 00:45:20,710
the designs are done and here's our spec

00:45:19,269 --> 00:45:23,019
and now it's over it just wouldn't

00:45:20,710 --> 00:45:26,289
worked we had a lot of certainly for and

00:45:23,019 --> 00:45:27,700
can be nutritious the lot of the

00:45:26,289 --> 00:45:29,349
functionality that site a lot of the

00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:31,809
count of that site was written before

00:45:29,349 --> 00:45:33,880
the designs were finalized because we

00:45:31,809 --> 00:45:35,500
knew that we could work with them in

00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:36,339
terms of finalizing the designs and

00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:38,470
making sure that they were quick to

00:45:36,339 --> 00:45:40,720
finish off and get that site life and we

00:45:38,470 --> 00:45:42,309
always yeah I'm but we always knew there

00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:44,289
was going to be phase two so no we were

00:45:42,309 --> 00:45:46,809
able to like take certain elements and

00:45:44,289 --> 00:45:48,400
go look can we is that a feasible thing

00:45:46,809 --> 00:45:50,470
for Phase two oh yeah no problem you

00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:52,210
know we don't need that now at all and

00:45:50,470 --> 00:45:53,980
on this kind of it wasn't a case of all

00:45:52,210 --> 00:45:55,720
here's the here's a shopping list get

00:45:53,980 --> 00:45:56,769
everything on us it was it was very

00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:58,750
clever approach and we're very happy

00:45:56,769 --> 00:46:00,609
with like the content as well we do that

00:45:58,750 --> 00:46:03,579
in parallel so it was the first time

00:46:00,609 --> 00:46:05,019
that we actually oh yeah sorry so just

00:46:03,579 --> 00:46:06,130
to know like I know where some of our

00:46:05,019 --> 00:46:08,049
other sites that we went live wit

00:46:06,130 --> 00:46:10,299
initially I think content is always the

00:46:08,049 --> 00:46:12,430
hardest piece at the very end just to

00:46:10,299 --> 00:46:13,990
get it across the deadline and so this

00:46:12,430 --> 00:46:16,210
was the first project that we actually

00:46:13,990 --> 00:46:18,339
managed to get all that in parallel just

00:46:16,210 --> 00:46:19,630
to get to that deadline so again as

00:46:18,339 --> 00:46:21,700
Island said it's completely

00:46:19,630 --> 00:46:22,990
collaboration once everyone's on the

00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:25,119
same page and knows what has to be done

00:46:22,990 --> 00:46:30,059
and work together it can it can be done

00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:30,059
pretty fast cool thanks very much

00:46:33,580 --> 00:46:40,190
and I work for regulator so our content

00:46:37,340 --> 00:46:42,140
is unique and and we've really struggled

00:46:40,190 --> 00:46:43,580
with dev agencies to get them to fully

00:46:42,140 --> 00:46:45,410
understand what we do in a thought

00:46:43,580 --> 00:46:46,700
environment we work in as well if you've

00:46:45,410 --> 00:46:49,280
got any tips about how you talk about

00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:51,020
collaboration about how to get how

00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:53,000
working with agencies and how to get

00:46:51,020 --> 00:46:54,620
them to understand the salt pressures

00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,730
that we have and also what's worked well

00:46:54,620 --> 00:46:57,110
in your collaboration and what hasn't

00:46:55,730 --> 00:47:00,080
worked well what you might have done

00:46:57,110 --> 00:47:02,420
differently and I think a lot of the

00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:04,370
time the business especially if a

00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:06,170
business unit is dealing with say two

00:47:04,370 --> 00:47:07,610
different agencies which which they

00:47:06,170 --> 00:47:09,620
generally are in terms of development

00:47:07,610 --> 00:47:11,180
design and content for some reason the

00:47:09,620 --> 00:47:13,190
business seem to be afraid to bring all

00:47:11,180 --> 00:47:14,990
those people into one room and to have

00:47:13,190 --> 00:47:16,550
those daily calls and daily meetings and

00:47:14,990 --> 00:47:17,990
say they tend to assign one person the

00:47:16,550 --> 00:47:19,700
business to communicate between our tree

00:47:17,990 --> 00:47:21,560
but it really is necessary to have

00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:24,170
everyone in the room again like with

00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:27,770
with Alan and I nanotech like we we

00:47:24,170 --> 00:47:30,260
operate very closely and we did have our

00:47:27,770 --> 00:47:32,420
daily calls weekly calls all in the one

00:47:30,260 --> 00:47:36,250
room I think that is the main thing Yuri

00:47:32,420 --> 00:47:36,250
just have to bring everyone together

00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:42,590
like like sorry I'll get told out of it

00:47:40,130 --> 00:47:45,500
you into agency embedded within your

00:47:42,590 --> 00:47:47,630
office so essentially and our digital

00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:49,640
media team is like an agency right and

00:47:47,630 --> 00:47:51,470
similar to an attack as an agency I

00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:53,570
don't want to refer to an attorney as an

00:47:51,470 --> 00:47:55,400
agency so that that was two of us and

00:47:53,570 --> 00:47:58,280
dealing together very closely and then

00:47:55,400 --> 00:48:00,350
we'd work say with the point of contact

00:47:58,280 --> 00:48:01,910
for sign off within the business and

00:48:00,350 --> 00:48:03,680
we'd have everything communicated back

00:48:01,910 --> 00:48:05,540
but I think because I think we were

00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:07,730
locally because we were designed and

00:48:05,540 --> 00:48:09,590
then we just a manga late the the dev

00:48:07,730 --> 00:48:11,990
and the design together we were able to

00:48:09,590 --> 00:48:13,220
have that collaboration yeah we weren't

00:48:11,990 --> 00:48:14,480
all in the same room I don't know we're

00:48:13,220 --> 00:48:15,980
not in the same room it wasn't really

00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:17,270
possible because a lot of the business

00:48:15,980 --> 00:48:19,160
unit air base in the States yeah so we

00:48:17,270 --> 00:48:20,810
were in the US for majority of this

00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:22,400
project but we did have regular touch

00:48:20,810 --> 00:48:24,440
points and made sure that we bought

00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:26,900
understood exactly what what point we

00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:28,040
were at in the project so I think I

00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:29,570
think that that's the main thing like

00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:31,760
bought like when we were in meetings

00:48:29,570 --> 00:48:34,010
with Alan for example we'd have our

00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:35,420
designers in that meeting as well we

00:48:34,010 --> 00:48:38,060
were just lucky that they were also on

00:48:35,420 --> 00:48:40,580
our team yes I think sometimes if that

00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:42,620
isn't the case then it tends to get a

00:48:40,580 --> 00:48:44,870
bit complex the same a content the

00:48:42,620 --> 00:48:45,140
content was also within our team so they

00:48:44,870 --> 00:48:46,519
crawl

00:48:45,140 --> 00:48:49,039
to jump into meetings if they felt

00:48:46,519 --> 00:48:50,839
something wasn't working I think the big

00:48:49,039 --> 00:48:52,760
thing is a bit of give and take what we

00:48:50,839 --> 00:48:53,930
found was that let you know we would you

00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:55,730
know there might be 10 things presented

00:48:53,930 --> 00:48:57,289
as the might be challenging and we just

00:48:55,730 --> 00:48:58,250
go through them all you know half of

00:48:57,289 --> 00:49:00,380
them could be approached and slightly

00:48:58,250 --> 00:49:02,089
different way to make it easy another

00:49:00,380 --> 00:49:03,799
three or four could be put off to a

00:49:02,089 --> 00:49:05,450
later date but then final two and the

00:49:03,799 --> 00:49:07,130
business no no we really need that and

00:49:05,450 --> 00:49:08,180
then to get because there was a given

00:49:07,130 --> 00:49:09,589
take from the business you we can go

00:49:08,180 --> 00:49:11,510
okay fair enough we'll make sure that

00:49:09,589 --> 00:49:12,829
gets done you know and that that was

00:49:11,510 --> 00:49:13,910
huge you know because often times it

00:49:12,829 --> 00:49:16,309
doesn't work like that it's like no no

00:49:13,910 --> 00:49:17,990
that's it those are the deadline just

00:49:16,309 --> 00:49:20,150
changed that's but there the list things

00:49:17,990 --> 00:49:22,190
we need and the phased approach was huge

00:49:20,150 --> 00:49:23,630
as well because oftentimes certainly

00:49:22,190 --> 00:49:24,859
with marketing projects like this people

00:49:23,630 --> 00:49:26,420
are very afraid of a phased approach

00:49:24,859 --> 00:49:27,920
because they feel that oh well I won't

00:49:26,420 --> 00:49:29,930
get the budget next year you know are

00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:31,190
you know i'll be on to something x next

00:49:29,930 --> 00:49:32,359
year but it was a very committed

00:49:31,190 --> 00:49:34,099
decision that this is a living breathing

00:49:32,359 --> 00:49:35,569
website it's going to evolve it's going

00:49:34,099 --> 00:49:36,859
to change it's going to grow legs

00:49:35,569 --> 00:49:38,269
because the business unit itself is

00:49:36,859 --> 00:49:39,799
actually mentioned with three different

00:49:38,269 --> 00:49:41,450
units coming together so there's gonna

00:49:39,799 --> 00:49:43,220
be this initial phase of well okay you

00:49:41,450 --> 00:49:44,480
know you know bumping shoulders and

00:49:43,220 --> 00:49:46,369
knocking heads together to try to work

00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:47,930
out with their best approaches at a

00:49:46,369 --> 00:49:48,980
business level but eventually that's

00:49:47,930 --> 00:49:50,240
going to come together and it's going to

00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:51,650
filter down into direction on the

00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:54,230
website and the marketing materials as

00:49:51,650 --> 00:49:55,970
well so we knew that we weren't going to

00:49:54,230 --> 00:49:57,200
get nail at all and day one because the

00:49:55,970 --> 00:49:58,460
business hasn't got it nailed and they

00:49:57,200 --> 00:50:01,009
won't they're going to evolve and the

00:49:58,460 --> 00:50:01,819
website's got to evolve with it and so

00:50:01,009 --> 00:50:03,440
in terms of dealing with regulatory

00:50:01,819 --> 00:50:04,369
agencies yeah like I mean I know some of

00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:05,809
the stuff we talked about there would be

00:50:04,369 --> 00:50:07,279
interest to you guys in terms of my

00:50:05,809 --> 00:50:10,460
content staging is a big thing you know

00:50:07,279 --> 00:50:12,500
yes so and yeah I mean just to

00:50:10,460 --> 00:50:13,849
understand like as much as possible like

00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:14,930
I talked about how we did a better job

00:50:13,849 --> 00:50:16,400
in this project cuz we were a year

00:50:14,930 --> 00:50:18,529
working with the business and we knew a

00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:19,789
bit more about how they worked I think

00:50:18,529 --> 00:50:21,200
that's a big thing if you're working

00:50:19,789 --> 00:50:23,299
with an agency for a longer time and

00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:24,890
it's a good relationship certain things

00:50:23,299 --> 00:50:26,539
that are pressures to you that might

00:50:24,890 --> 00:50:28,460
seem like incidentals to an agency

00:50:26,539 --> 00:50:29,930
eventually you learn oh wait that really

00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:31,910
is a big deal and we better put a lot of

00:50:29,930 --> 00:50:33,349
effort into that and something else that

00:50:31,910 --> 00:50:35,299
we think is a big deal that can be left

00:50:33,349 --> 00:50:37,130
onto later or they don't care like you

00:50:35,299 --> 00:50:38,839
know like for your perspective I'd

00:50:37,130 --> 00:50:40,099
imagined that the ability to get content

00:50:38,839 --> 00:50:41,660
live at a certain date in a certain time

00:50:40,099 --> 00:50:43,970
with certain wording trumps everything

00:50:41,660 --> 00:50:45,049
yeah it does adachi first it's been a

00:50:43,970 --> 00:50:46,700
real difference from working on the

00:50:45,049 --> 00:50:48,740
project to exiting the clutch in moving

00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:50,390
in to be a you and we focus too much on

00:50:48,740 --> 00:50:52,490
the project and not on to actually

00:50:50,390 --> 00:50:54,019
working in the live environment or be a

00:50:52,490 --> 00:50:55,620
you and that was been a big lesson

00:50:54,019 --> 00:50:59,070
learned for us

00:50:55,620 --> 00:51:00,870
yeah I like yeah so I guess that's the

00:50:59,070 --> 00:51:02,160
thing to learn there is like whatever

00:51:00,870 --> 00:51:03,630
whatever makes you take or whatever your

00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:05,730
real pain point is to get try and get

00:51:03,630 --> 00:51:07,830
that across over and over again and then

00:51:05,730 --> 00:51:09,750
to understand that if the the agency is

00:51:07,830 --> 00:51:10,980
able to solve that problem that you know

00:51:09,750 --> 00:51:12,840
maybe cut them some slack on some other

00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:14,070
stuff I don't know maybe because it is

00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:16,560
give and take you know and if you can do

00:51:14,070 --> 00:51:17,670
like that you know like and yeah we've

00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:19,230
definitely come across the content

00:51:17,670 --> 00:51:20,630
staging and the revisionist offer for

00:51:19,230 --> 00:51:28,290
regulatory stuff and government stuff

00:51:20,630 --> 00:51:31,560
yeah and we gather and key any other

00:51:28,290 --> 00:51:33,690
questions okay we'll wrap it up with

00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:36,060
that and we're going to be with the

00:51:33,690 --> 00:51:37,740
stand downstairs boo the 901 I think it

00:51:36,060 --> 00:51:38,670
is downstairs on the coronaries you go

00:51:37,740 --> 00:51:40,020
in there or so if you've any other

00:51:38,670 --> 00:51:42,000
questions about the project or anything

00:51:40,020 --> 00:51:44,580
else just come up and say hello we won't

00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,690
bite and so yeah we'll see how the

00:51:44,580 --> 00:51:47,430
