Title: DrupalCon Dublin 2016: Structure for Creativity
Publication date: 2016-09-27
Playlist: DrupalCon Dublin 2016
Description: 
	You are probably familiar with collaboration across different skills, and we all know our good intentions to include as many perspectives as possible.
We all know we should communicate as much as possible, but sometimes sharing your thoughts is not enough – you have to find a way to actually work together.

So how do we collaborate to create quality digital products? 

In our work as respectively frontend developer and UX designer, we have discovered several approaches and tools to support valuable development. Come join our co-presentation of how we structure our work (and code) for a creative and smart development phase.

Do you want to do more than talk about creativity?

We will share stories of how design can keep evolving in the development phase, and how we use our differences to ensure creation of valuable digital products. 
How do we bring findings from the analysis phase through the design and development phase, and keep challenging our own knowledge of creative development with prototyping, user stories, Post CSS etc.

A conversation where we share examples, tools and tips from our daily initiatives to create valuable digital products and how we structure our work to keep learning and ensuring quality.

okay I think we hit the mark it's 14 15

00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:10,469
and I'm really happy to see all of you

00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:13,849
thanks for coming out we're really been

00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:18,300
looking forward to talk to you today

00:00:13,849 --> 00:00:24,949
first of all I am yin and I'm a UX

00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:26,730
designer at adapt I spent my work life

00:00:24,949 --> 00:00:30,359
designing the best user experience

00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:34,140
possible and in the when I have any time

00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:36,600
off I love people watching I love going

00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:39,840
around enjoying street life I live in

00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:41,730
Copenhagen so obviously I bike but not

00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,070
because our own too much about the

00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:46,260
climate but actually because it's the

00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:49,170
easy way to transport yourself in

00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:51,329
Copenhagen and that actually shows you a

00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:54,930
bit on my perspective on my work in

00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:57,840
general making it as concrete as

00:00:54,930 --> 00:01:02,039
valuable for the user as possible so

00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:04,250
that was me with me today hello my name

00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:08,010
is Matt cmas I'm a front-end developer

00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:12,860
and I also work at adapt we work in the

00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:15,420
same team in my spare time I bike

00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:17,729
because it's very good transportation in

00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:20,580
Copenhagen it's very efficient and also

00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:22,830
I play music I play in a band should go

00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:26,070
check it out it's really cool no

00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:27,390
advertisement just saying and yeah I'm

00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:29,689
just going to talk about adapt very

00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:32,780
quickly adapt this a digital agency

00:01:29,689 --> 00:01:35,729
which is located in Copenhagen Denmark

00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:38,670
if anybody didn't you and it was

00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:41,220
established back in 1998 and since then

00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:44,640
it has published over 2,000 digital

00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:48,119
solutions and there's around 100

00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,560
employees who said earlier we work in

00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:51,810
client seems which means that we have

00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:53,909
want different roles in the team's may

00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:55,890
be multiple we work together and we have

00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:57,540
like the same role to to communicate

00:01:55,890 --> 00:02:04,829
with and that leaves a very strong bond

00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:06,689
internally um yeah and today we are

00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:10,440
going to talk about structure for

00:02:06,689 --> 00:02:13,350
creativity and the reason why we are so

00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:16,500
passionate about this topic is base

00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:20,550
how do we link the innocent ish initial

00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:23,760
vision the initial enthusiasm and

00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:30,180
passion for product to the actually end

00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:32,160
result yeah and to just give you a bit

00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:35,640
of an idea of what we're going to go

00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:37,650
over so you know what to expect first

00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:40,170
off I'm going to take you through how to

00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:43,350
structure your vision and your user

00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:44,730
insights and then afterwards I'm going

00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:48,080
to be talking about how to structure

00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:51,050
your design and you user experience and

00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:53,670
after that mass will take you through

00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:57,120
I'm going to talk about how you make a

00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:58,800
project structure more practically same

00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,990
way workflow and i'm going to give some

00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,100
a few tips oh i'm going to press this

00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:04,350
button so you can see what i'm talking

00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:06,690
about and give some tool tips and

00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:09,990
examples on how I work everything has a

00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:11,550
front under and as we said we think a

00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:13,560
structure is so important if you want to

00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:16,830
click create a product of high quality

00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:19,500
because you remain and with a great

00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:21,870
overview and but what is quality really

00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:25,910
we asked to sell this is it the material

00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:28,200
is it the design so the refinement and

00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:29,700
often it's very subjective what what

00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:32,910
quality really is because it could be

00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:35,550
very different from different different

00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:38,070
cases if you want the product to be

00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:40,800
cheap you don't want it to be leather or

00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:42,960
something a very a very rich material so

00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:44,790
this way the quality could also be

00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:46,650
something of real exclusive material and

00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:48,990
so we can really depend but what really

00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:50,820
quality is very shortened is if when you

00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:52,770
use when the company uses their common

00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:55,530
senses as knowledge to create a product

00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:57,240
which adds value to the end user that's

00:03:55,530 --> 00:04:05,520
really what what is what quality is

00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:08,730
about so what is creativity then it's a

00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:12,300
matter of creating a disruptive product

00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:18,299
creating a unique experience or is it

00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:21,239
about aesthetics well for me creativity

00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:23,970
is when you see an opportunity for a

00:04:21,239 --> 00:04:28,169
product or service that has the ability

00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:31,440
to change user behavior and the and

00:04:28,169 --> 00:04:34,020
introduce new possibilities for the end

00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:38,040
user or for the market so it's a matter

00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:43,530
of pushing yourself and your ideas

00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:46,860
forward and how do you do this and that

00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:50,610
is where structure comes in to play why

00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:55,560
should be structure it is because if you

00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:58,169
want to create with creativity and you

00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:00,450
want the high quality for your product

00:04:58,169 --> 00:05:06,780
you need a structure to work with them

00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:10,050
and there is an kind of a conflict in

00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:12,600
this because for for me at least when I

00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:15,000
think about creativity there's also an

00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:17,340
element of chaos into that you need to

00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,250
be able to spin off of ideas and don't

00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:24,510
lock yourself in too fast in a certain

00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:29,460
direction or a certain user group or a

00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:31,740
certain context but if you don't create

00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:35,250
some kind of structure you can actually

00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:38,310
end up being lost in your chaos because

00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:42,450
when you start out with a product it

00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:44,340
might work as in right now with a little

00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:48,600
bit of chaos built into it and we

00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:50,370
probably all try this and but if you

00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:52,680
want to keep on building on it and

00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:54,780
actually take your product further you

00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:57,419
need some kind of structure and I don't

00:05:54,780 --> 00:06:00,540
mean just in code as a user experience

00:05:57,419 --> 00:06:03,810
designer I also mean it when I look at

00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:06,030
the user insights how I structure the

00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:08,280
vision how do I make sure that this is

00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:11,640
actually a format that people can keep

00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:13,650
on working with and where it's that it's

00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:16,560
not set in stone and it's not

00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:18,720
determining a path for a product I think

00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,580
the most beautiful thing is when user

00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,470
actually does something you do not

00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:25,500
expect them to do with your product and

00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:28,500
in that sense actually open up for a

00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:35,820
creative loop that can keep you going

00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:39,480
forward so yeah one last point about

00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:41,400
this when you when you have a straw

00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:43,860
sure that actually gives you the

00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:46,140
opportunities to navigate your different

00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:50,300
choices and map them out you can also

00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:52,920
then prioritize in what you focus on and

00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:57,000
to quote a guy who has a lot of

00:06:52,920 --> 00:07:00,930
decisions to make every day I would say

00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:04,470
and he really inspires me in in simple

00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:07,590
ways that Princeton he only has a blue

00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:09,570
and gray suits because he actually don't

00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:12,140
want to spend his time making the

00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:14,670
decision of what he wears every day and

00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:16,920
that is because you need to focus your

00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:19,170
decision-making energy you need to ruin

00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:22,200
eyes yourself you can't be going through

00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:24,450
the day distracted by trivia and to

00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:28,560
actually implement that in your work you

00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:33,270
need some structure so how do we do this

00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:35,310
this is all good good ideas on paper but

00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:38,100
how do you actually practice that in

00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:39,540
your everyday life and this is what

00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:43,440
we're going to be talking about for the

00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:46,110
next 40 minutes where first I want to

00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:49,520
show you this you probably all seen some

00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:52,290
sort of variation of this model before

00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:54,810
but it just to give you a highlight of

00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:57,480
on what we are going to focus on so you

00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:59,670
start up understanding the vision and

00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:02,310
making it yours I'm going to elaborate

00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:04,830
slightly on this a bit later and then

00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:07,770
you need to determine the desire uses

00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:10,260
and what experience it is you want to

00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:12,180
create then you need to break it down

00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:14,820
and structure it into user stories

00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:18,660
making it more clear what it is we're

00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:20,970
actually building and then you want to

00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:23,030
start experimenting in prototype and if

00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:26,370
this is not to say that this loop is

00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:30,810
timely necessarily in this order these

00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:32,760
can go they can be how do you say that

00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:35,190
parallel to each other as well in

00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:38,099
processes but the reason why I've

00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:40,349
highlighted this part of the circle is

00:08:38,099 --> 00:08:43,020
actually because this is where from my

00:08:40,349 --> 00:08:46,920
point of view a lot of knowledge gets

00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:49,920
get lost a lot of misunderstandings and

00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:51,180
this is kind of one of the weak spots in

00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:53,430
the loop so that's what I'm going to

00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:55,649
talk about and then afterwards

00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:57,330
mass is going to elaborate further on

00:08:55,649 --> 00:09:00,540
how you structure your prototype to

00:08:57,330 --> 00:09:02,760
actually have it going in to your

00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:04,920
actually development and your test phase

00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:11,339
and so forth so this is what we're going

00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:13,470
to be focusing on for this talk okay you

00:09:11,339 --> 00:09:16,140
probably all met a client that have a

00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:19,980
pretty certain idea or vision for their

00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:23,040
product and you sit there thinking okay

00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:28,680
I actually see a completely different

00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:31,770
perspective or idea for this product to

00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:34,890
evolve what it is you set out to do so

00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:37,920
how do you actually meet this client and

00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:42,120
make it a vision that you can work on

00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:44,279
together you need to understand the

00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:46,470
vision and I set this a couple of times

00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:48,570
but what do I mean by that I don't mean

00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:51,839
that you just have to listen and listen

00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:55,380
carefully but that you actually have to

00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:59,000
make it your own you have to engage with

00:09:55,380 --> 00:10:01,440
it and how do you do this how do you

00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:04,620
become so close to your client and

00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:06,420
believe it as well as they do well you

00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:10,080
take your skill sets and then you start

00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:13,200
to challenge it because a client

00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:15,570
preferably came to you because you have

00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:19,110
something they do not have so you want

00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:21,540
to activate that and some of the ways

00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:24,660
that we do that is asking the questions

00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:27,300
from the user perspective a lot of

00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:30,420
clients have a pretty clear expectation

00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:33,209
on okay I have this idea this vision

00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:35,910
this is how I expected to be met by the

00:10:33,209 --> 00:10:38,730
client this is how I think it's going to

00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:41,279
do on the market and so forth but the

00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:43,290
reality might be completely different

00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:47,400
and this is where you can really come

00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:49,980
into play by doing your analysis finding

00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:52,950
the user insights for the user groups

00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:55,110
that they have identified or maybe find

00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:58,440
out that it's not the right user groups

00:10:55,110 --> 00:11:01,170
for this product after all but you go

00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:04,430
into the market you look at the business

00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:06,720
context you do a competitor analysis and

00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:07,050
obviously you have in the back of your

00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,050
mind

00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:12,269
your knowledge about new digital

00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:17,279
opportunities that could come in to play

00:11:12,269 --> 00:11:21,060
to actually realize this product so what

00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:24,839
you can give a client by actually

00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:27,690
spending time on making the vision yours

00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:30,360
is a more clear definition that will

00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:36,329
make it easier for you to actually build

00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:39,690
what it is they want because if you if

00:11:36,329 --> 00:11:41,730
you if you keep standing on the outside

00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:43,769
of the vision and saying okay so this is

00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:47,579
your vision and I'm just here to make

00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:49,860
that a reality for you there will be

00:11:47,579 --> 00:11:52,140
limits to how far you can get if you

00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:56,310
don't get in to the mindset and as an

00:11:52,140 --> 00:12:00,750
example we worked with a game industry

00:11:56,310 --> 00:12:02,339
player who were looking we were

00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:05,519
collaborating with us to create a

00:12:02,339 --> 00:12:08,519
product for game developers to promote

00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:11,820
and share their games and they identify

00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:13,560
a variety of user groups up in the

00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:17,040
corner we have the typical game

00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:20,670
developer from a small size medium sized

00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:23,430
game developer brand and we have in the

00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:26,130
middle of the consumer who could for

00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:28,920
instance be your mom on a smartphone we

00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:32,220
have journalists who will share and

00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:34,860
write about gaming news and so forth and

00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:37,829
then obviously we have the big brands

00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:39,930
who all the game developers are keen to

00:12:37,829 --> 00:12:42,870
hook up with for them to realize their

00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:45,300
dreams basically so how do you create a

00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:47,520
product that actually meet all of these

00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:49,649
at one point well we sat down with our

00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:53,910
client and we really talked this through

00:12:49,649 --> 00:12:58,380
and which a user group did they actually

00:12:53,910 --> 00:13:01,290
believe had the power to realize this

00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:04,410
product and who would they prioritize

00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:09,089
and that this is where this come in you

00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:11,820
need to make some roadmap for how you're

00:13:09,089 --> 00:13:14,850
going to build your product so you don't

00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:16,709
end up shooting in 10,000 different

00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:20,370
directions and not really hitting

00:13:16,709 --> 00:13:23,190
anybody and prioritizing I don't mean

00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:26,460
that that means that ok if we prioritize

00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:29,339
one we do not prioritize the other but

00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:32,190
if you're clever about what how you

00:13:29,339 --> 00:13:35,070
prioritize you use a group you actually

00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:37,529
end up hitting hitting them in the right

00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:39,990
order or maybe understanding the

00:13:37,529 --> 00:13:43,670
relationships between the different user

00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:45,839
groups and in this case we ended up

00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:49,290
identifying together with the client

00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:51,510
that ok our main user group was the game

00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:53,970
developer and we actually figured out

00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:57,900
that ok if we make it easier for games

00:13:53,970 --> 00:14:00,029
developers to share more knowledge about

00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:01,950
their games and the game development it

00:14:00,029 --> 00:14:05,400
was more likely for journalists to write

00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:08,220
about them if journalist wrote about

00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:11,430
these game developers the big brands

00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:14,910
were more likely to notice it and we end

00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:16,770
up with the consumer that really don't

00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:19,050
care about game development they just

00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:21,690
want to have it easy and fast right in

00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:25,860
the app store right so when you

00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:28,500
prioritize you also make the roadmap for

00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:31,790
yourself to say ok which one are we

00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:36,510
going to take off first and who are we

00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:38,430
testing the solution for and so in that

00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:41,700
manner you make it easier for yourself

00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:44,880
to take decisions later on you limit

00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:47,100
your choices by saying okay I have this

00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:49,740
priority and that I've done this

00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:51,510
priority with my open eyes and it's not

00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:53,400
to say that anything is said in set in

00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:55,740
stone because obviously we know that

00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:57,420
that can change but as long as you clear

00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:59,370
on where you are right now you also have

00:14:57,420 --> 00:15:03,810
the ability to change and actually

00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:07,290
change in a matter where you have where

00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:11,250
you know what you're doing so we know

00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:14,160
our main target group then you start to

00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:18,720
look into the different user sites for

00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:21,089
user sorry user insights for this main

00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:23,640
target group you identify and that can

00:15:21,089 --> 00:15:26,160
be all over the place I mean that can be

00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:28,950
the data format oolitic that can be

00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:31,920
qualitative or quantitative data that

00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:34,200
you pulled out from your analysis I'm

00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:36,630
not going to dive into the details

00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:38,910
you but in terms of structure there's

00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:40,830
just a really important step that I want

00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:44,010
to highlight here and that is to take

00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:48,540
your analysis and then make a top free

00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:51,870
or top five of okay this is our my main

00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:55,050
insights that I want to focus on solving

00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:57,990
with the solution i'm creating because

00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:59,880
also when you work in teams it can be

00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:02,340
quite messy to stay down here and

00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:05,010
communicate all of this to your team but

00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:07,980
if you have a top 35 whatever makes

00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:10,380
sense that can be easily translated and

00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:12,960
communicated all along both to your

00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:15,090
client and to your team another way to

00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:17,220
structure it could be in personas where

00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:21,270
you say okay these insights I've

00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:23,790
transformed into two parts of my main

00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:25,800
user group where I can identify that to

00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:30,110
a person that can sometimes be easier

00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:34,040
for somebody to actually have Brad or

00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:39,650
Christina to reference to in day-to-day

00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:42,240
work so that's another way to do it and

00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:45,420
now we come into the funny part of

00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:47,970
breaking it down and structuring it in

00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:50,550
user stories I don't know how many of

00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:54,060
you have actually started out creating a

00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:56,490
backlog for a new product and but it can

00:16:54,060 --> 00:17:00,540
seem a bit overwhelming of where do I

00:16:56,490 --> 00:17:03,420
actually start with this and the reason

00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:06,240
why I've spent a couple minutes

00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:08,699
highlighting the user groups and the

00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:12,810
user insights is because if you don't

00:17:08,699 --> 00:17:15,990
know these things just at least on the

00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:18,240
surface to some degree then it can be

00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:21,120
really hard to start writing the user

00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:24,150
stories then it will probably be what's

00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:27,690
on top of mine for you so if you have

00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:29,850
your user group prioritize and you have

00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:32,160
your user insights they are actually

00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:38,390
tools you can really use when you start

00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:42,030
to create a backlog and use the stories

00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:45,000
it's a beautiful format that many of you

00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:46,610
probably work with on a day-to-day basis

00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,750
just to

00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:53,299
wrap it up it's actually a format that

00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:55,309
gives you the possibility to describe an

00:17:53,299 --> 00:17:58,970
experience instead of simply a

00:17:55,309 --> 00:18:02,900
specification the format here is as a

00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:09,950
user type I want to do something so I

00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:12,470
can experience or achieve a goal and by

00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:15,260
define defining it like this you can

00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:17,299
easily link this to your user insights

00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:19,820
because you have the different types

00:18:17,299 --> 00:18:23,270
already planned out in for instance your

00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:28,309
personas or you have you structure your

00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:30,679
user insights and already there in the

00:18:28,309 --> 00:18:33,110
first leg you help both your client and

00:18:30,679 --> 00:18:35,240
developers identifying what who are we

00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:41,330
actually building this specific part 4

00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:44,660
and and so forth and the reason why this

00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:47,660
is as strong is obviously because it

00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:50,570
puts the user in the center but it also

00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:58,120
gives the client opportunity to

00:18:50,570 --> 00:19:01,490
prioritize between them and to start off

00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:03,950
you have the epics where you start

00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:06,380
prioritizing and by an epic I mean and

00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:09,530
overall use a story that is to be

00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:13,340
typically a feature or area of a

00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:16,880
solution and that can be identified by

00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:18,950
saying it can't be built in a day so we

00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:21,200
are in an overall perspective but by

00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:23,600
actually creating these at first hand

00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:27,080
you give the client a possibility to say

00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:31,220
okay I I i would i would suggest as this

00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:33,410
one goes on top and you have a structure

00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:35,720
that gives you the pipe the possibility

00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:38,900
to challenge that by saying but actually

00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:41,000
if this user group is your main one this

00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:43,360
should go on top and so forth and then

00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:46,790
again as structure for communication

00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:49,610
when you have the epics you identify the

00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:51,890
overall scope of what you're doing you

00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:56,090
break it down in to user stories and

00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:58,280
these are what will hit development and

00:19:56,090 --> 00:20:00,249
take you all the way through until the

00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:03,889
end result

00:20:00,249 --> 00:20:06,019
so they become way more specific and

00:20:03,889 --> 00:20:08,840
they can be built in a day compared to

00:20:06,019 --> 00:20:11,299
the epics so here we actually specify

00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:16,519
with acceptance criteria and so forth

00:20:11,299 --> 00:20:20,119
what it is we are building but but my in

00:20:16,519 --> 00:20:21,950
but in my experience this seems like the

00:20:20,119 --> 00:20:23,899
clear way to do it but that's just never

00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:26,840
what's happening when you work with a

00:20:23,899 --> 00:20:29,600
backlog you usually get stuck a bit in

00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:31,909
between where you either broken it all

00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:33,799
down to user stories and you have you

00:20:31,909 --> 00:20:35,659
figure out okay this user story is

00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:37,429
actually quite an epic because it was

00:20:35,659 --> 00:20:40,070
way more complex than I initially

00:20:37,429 --> 00:20:42,470
thought so you have to break it down

00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:45,409
again or the other way around you maybe

00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:47,240
sit there as a sit with the client and

00:20:45,409 --> 00:20:49,549
said okay we are going to prioritize

00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:54,169
these epics and some minor details

00:20:49,549 --> 00:20:56,749
ending up being mixed up with like huge

00:20:54,169 --> 00:21:00,529
initiatives so they are not quite on the

00:20:56,749 --> 00:21:04,399
same level and that's the beauty of this

00:21:00,529 --> 00:21:08,600
you can't foresee it all so don't stress

00:21:04,399 --> 00:21:11,330
about not having the overview at the

00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:12,799
first hit because this is just a

00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:15,019
structure for you to be able to

00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:19,100
communicate and as as you move along

00:21:15,019 --> 00:21:22,369
into the process you can easily easier

00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:24,769
and transform these if you do not set

00:21:22,369 --> 00:21:26,960
them in stone and this you need to

00:21:24,769 --> 00:21:29,840
communicate obviously with the client

00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:32,029
and with the team because it's really

00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:38,740
really important that you keep updating

00:21:32,029 --> 00:21:41,749
the backlog so how do you structure your

00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:46,100
updating of backlog because a lot of

00:21:41,749 --> 00:21:48,169
information can be in this long list of

00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:51,200
use of stories so how do you make sure

00:21:48,169 --> 00:21:55,340
that none of the decision you made along

00:21:51,200 --> 00:22:00,049
the way get lost or it's not clear for

00:21:55,340 --> 00:22:01,999
the client or for the team there's a few

00:22:00,049 --> 00:22:04,429
things that I've learned as I work with

00:22:01,999 --> 00:22:06,799
this and I want to share with those with

00:22:04,429 --> 00:22:09,259
you and that one thing is that you need

00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:12,590
to keep you epic cyl I've and what I

00:22:09,259 --> 00:22:14,000
mean by that is don't get too far into

00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:17,270
the details

00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:21,980
without knowing why why are we building

00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:25,070
this exact user story so on up on up

00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:28,420
sorry that was a different one and so

00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:31,790
there's different tools that we work to

00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:34,040
work with that adapt to do this it's

00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:36,230
tools like easy backlog simply for

00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:39,200
writing up your user stories it's an

00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:41,450
easy and quick format to to write them

00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:43,760
and then when we start to work together

00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:45,650
as a team we work in a tool called JIRA

00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:48,760
I know there's a lot of other great

00:22:45,650 --> 00:22:53,480
tools out there to actually handle this

00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:55,520
but for instance you have the

00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:58,940
possibility to actually link your

00:22:55,520 --> 00:23:01,400
information together and that can be by

00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:05,090
identifying different user type make

00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:06,800
sure that that the logic of your user

00:23:05,090 --> 00:23:09,950
types in your user stories is quite

00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:13,220
clear for the team have a introduction

00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:16,280
of how you structured it and so they

00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:18,710
know for instance with this client we

00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:21,050
work with we had like the game developer

00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:25,310
who has locked into the solution a game

00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:27,140
developer who hasn't a journalist and so

00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:31,340
forth so we had the representation of

00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:43,280
the different user types and then you

00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:46,070
want to link yeah and as I said you want

00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:48,290
to create the clear link between the

00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:51,830
epic and the user stories it broken down

00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:54,260
to and honor practically that could be

00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:56,870
done with a label that highlights with

00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:59,420
which epics are you working towards

00:23:56,870 --> 00:24:02,530
achieving at the moment with the issues

00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:05,810
of stories making it again clear for the

00:24:02,530 --> 00:24:11,870
for both the client and your team what

00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:14,450
is going on and then you can group the

00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:16,700
different user stories by components and

00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:19,100
I'm what I mean by that is that I've

00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:22,490
tried several times when we start to

00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:26,020
build we start to form the backlog from

00:24:22,490 --> 00:24:27,830
the epics it becomes clear that some

00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:30,980
some of what we're building

00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:33,700
Mike might overlap and you want to make

00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:36,500
that clear so instead of having web

00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:39,049
repetitions of features you're building

00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:41,210
you want to actually make it one and

00:24:39,049 --> 00:24:44,289
then label it with all the different

00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:47,179
epochs that you're trying to achieve so

00:24:44,289 --> 00:24:50,179
keep on revising and as you learn more

00:24:47,179 --> 00:24:54,039
about what it is you're building and you

00:24:50,179 --> 00:24:57,820
become smarter and smarter and then

00:24:54,039 --> 00:25:04,130
mirror that into your structure so

00:24:57,820 --> 00:25:06,350
you're always have as much as possible

00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:10,010
and up to date back lot that actually

00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:14,360
mirrors where you are in the process so

00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:16,760
keep your epochs alive and just to give

00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:21,740
you an example of the benefit of this in

00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:25,429
the project I was referring to before we

00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:31,120
had identified our main target group as

00:25:25,429 --> 00:25:34,340
the game developer from that we took on

00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:36,740
we could prioritize some epics and break

00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:39,940
them down that was actually essential to

00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:44,240
this user group and in the product that

00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:47,029
ended up in a focus on a creation

00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:50,090
creation flow for the game developer

00:25:47,029 --> 00:25:52,789
that this unboring part of the product

00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:56,690
needed to be as clear and as simple as

00:25:52,789 --> 00:26:00,230
possible because our main user group

00:25:56,690 --> 00:26:03,940
actually had a few barriers to watch

00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:08,149
writing about their own games sharing

00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:10,610
photos that were presenting their games

00:26:08,149 --> 00:26:12,620
in the best manner and so forth so this

00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:15,289
was actually a part of the product that

00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:17,419
needed a lot of attention and we could

00:26:15,289 --> 00:26:20,149
see that because we had gone through the

00:26:17,419 --> 00:26:22,690
process of say is saying okay this is

00:26:20,149 --> 00:26:26,750
the main user group that we're actually

00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:29,090
building to achieve we're building this

00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:32,299
solution for your building this product

00:26:29,090 --> 00:26:37,100
for and in that sense it become became

00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:41,170
very clear and this gives you a chance

00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:43,000
also to always have in mind what

00:26:41,170 --> 00:26:47,680
happened throughout your development

00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:49,840
that link the vision to the UN sites to

00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:52,480
the user story so you can always see

00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:58,020
that line making it way clear for

00:26:52,480 --> 00:27:02,230
everybody involved so on the last note I

00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:05,890
want to say that all of this can seem a

00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:10,660
bit dry if you don't validate it with

00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:13,120
prototyping and mass is going to die way

00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:15,430
further into the prototyping aspect of

00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:18,700
this I just want to say that for me

00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:21,250
remember that prototyping doesn't have

00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:23,620
to be that complex pen and paper is your

00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:26,170
best friend to simply visualize what

00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:27,940
you're talking about visualize what part

00:27:26,170 --> 00:27:32,860
of the solution you are talking about

00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:37,260
and testing it and by testing it there's

00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:41,650
obviously a big initiative you can take

00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:43,990
and have a formal user test which can be

00:27:41,650 --> 00:27:48,100
very beneficial but already early on

00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:50,350
it's really valuable to test your ideas

00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:53,590
on your colleagues if you have access to

00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:57,880
some game developers try that out in the

00:27:53,590 --> 00:28:00,190
in this case and don't be afraid to show

00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:02,860
your work even though it might not be

00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:05,560
done at all because that is where you

00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:08,920
get the most honest input from your

00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:10,870
colleagues your your user group and so

00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:13,270
forth when they actually see a

00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:18,550
possibility to affect the product that

00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:24,250
you're making so yeah yes to sum up

00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:26,050
before mess is going to take over you

00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:29,500
need to structure your vision a user

00:28:26,050 --> 00:28:32,890
insights and you do that by

00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:36,160
understanding the vision make it yours

00:28:32,890 --> 00:28:40,540
remember to challenge it with your

00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:42,520
knowledge with your mindset and and then

00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:46,120
you need to prioritize your user groups

00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:50,890
and your user insights remember to sum

00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:53,080
it up and share it with your team so so

00:28:50,890 --> 00:28:55,280
the knowledge doesn't get stuck in some

00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:57,440
analysis and that

00:28:55,280 --> 00:29:00,890
actually end up affecting the product

00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:04,430
and then keep coming back for validation

00:29:00,890 --> 00:29:07,880
to these insights having have it in tub

00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:10,790
of your mind it can be on your wall it

00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:13,820
can be in your head it could be as your

00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:17,000
screensaver just remember to always come

00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:22,760
back and then you need to structure your

00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:25,760
design and user experience you highlight

00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:31,550
the the logic of your different user

00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:35,900
types and and how your epics are linked

00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:38,270
to the different user stories and this

00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:41,000
gives you a chance to always revise and

00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:44,090
prioritize your back luck with your

00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:46,520
client and with your team because we

00:29:44,090 --> 00:29:50,150
actually know which part we are talking

00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:54,650
about at all times and then you need to

00:29:50,150 --> 00:29:58,220
do prototyping at all times both from

00:29:54,650 --> 00:30:00,650
loaf i but obviously taking it to code

00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:03,140
as soon as it makes sense and this is

00:30:00,650 --> 00:30:07,400
where mess is coming in to share a bit

00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:09,590
on how he structures 24 for the

00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:18,890
development process yeah cool Thank You

00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:21,080
Jana let's give her a hand um yeah no

00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:23,450
mention just before a prototyping and I

00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:24,920
this is a very interesting words that we

00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:27,530
talk a lot about it seems like the buzz

00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:28,970
word that's come out right now and first

00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:30,620
of all I would like to get indication of

00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:33,890
how many are you upfront dinners would

00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:37,460
you raise a hand okay cool half half

00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:40,580
cool um so maybe the rest of you don't

00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:42,410
don't get too bored it's a very

00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:44,240
interesting stuff it's my god I'll ever

00:30:42,410 --> 00:30:47,420
get a very practical with maybe some bit

00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:48,710
code but what is really prototyping them

00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:50,720
because maybe not all of you are

00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:53,180
familiar with this term for us it's a

00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:55,280
really good way to validate and some of

00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:57,260
the ideas we have because if you start

00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:59,120
building the whole project you're using

00:30:57,260 --> 00:31:00,620
a lot of different phases you are

00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:02,300
there's a lot of there's a lot of a

00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:04,490
Rolls involved and you're building a

00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:07,370
prototype you're just writing a basic

00:31:04,490 --> 00:31:09,200
HTML and CSS so like instead of having

00:31:07,370 --> 00:31:11,630
to go through a lot of process you just

00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:12,980
have this very fast small project which

00:31:11,630 --> 00:31:14,809
you can test and if it doesn't really

00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:17,029
work you can just throw it out what's

00:31:14,809 --> 00:31:19,700
really cool about it is if it actually

00:31:17,029 --> 00:31:21,799
works you can use it for user testing a

00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:23,960
lot of different ways you can test it to

00:31:21,799 --> 00:31:26,600
validate these ideas you really have

00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:28,429
they actually works um because I've seen

00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:29,779
some examples where you do a lot of user

00:31:28,429 --> 00:31:32,510
testing and you get a lot of knowledge

00:31:29,779 --> 00:31:33,740
okay this works this didn't work and

00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:37,370
then you'll be stronger against the

00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:40,820
hippo which is this a nasty fellow over

00:31:37,370 --> 00:31:42,080
here sorry bosses and this is a I've

00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:43,340
tried multiple places where you have a

00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:45,500
lot of great ideas you come up with a

00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:47,929
solution but there's this guy just

00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:48,799
saying okay I won't option B but when

00:31:47,929 --> 00:31:51,110
you actually have done a lot of

00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:52,549
prototyping you actually know what what

00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:54,230
is actually going on and you have

00:31:52,549 --> 00:31:56,690
arguments against this so it's a really

00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:58,490
strong card to know okay maybe you want

00:31:56,690 --> 00:32:00,679
option B this clearly none but

00:31:58,490 --> 00:32:02,419
nonetheless you actually know this is

00:32:00,679 --> 00:32:05,179
result and this actually gives a better

00:32:02,419 --> 00:32:07,159
benefit so that's a really really good

00:32:05,179 --> 00:32:10,010
way to it another thing that's really

00:32:07,159 --> 00:32:12,080
awesome about it it's actually how you

00:32:10,010 --> 00:32:14,360
can try to smooth the transition between

00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:16,070
the different roles because like we have

00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:17,600
the vision you have the analysis the

00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:20,330
design and then the development and I'm

00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:22,250
I'm pretty far in that list so like the

00:32:20,330 --> 00:32:24,350
knowledge the first guy gets how to

00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:26,779
actually get this by actually having the

00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:28,730
designer and the UX designer on the

00:32:26,779 --> 00:32:30,080
prototype I make sure they're like some

00:32:28,730 --> 00:32:31,760
of the knowledge actually being spent

00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:33,320
here I actually going into the X to the

00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:35,539
final product because all the code i

00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:39,679
right I can just paste into the into the

00:32:35,539 --> 00:32:41,929
project um so it's a really a way for us

00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:44,419
to try to see and we can save some of

00:32:41,929 --> 00:32:46,309
the saver and and use some of the

00:32:44,419 --> 00:32:49,159
knowledge that has been found in the

00:32:46,309 --> 00:32:50,779
analysis and but you can and you can

00:32:49,159 --> 00:32:51,919
copy your work as i said earlier but you

00:32:50,779 --> 00:32:54,380
can only done this if you have

00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:58,490
structured correctly so structure your

00:32:54,380 --> 00:33:00,919
work I've tried a one time when I went

00:32:58,490 --> 00:33:02,120
back to and all the project and I just

00:33:00,919 --> 00:33:05,029
look I was just looking at this course

00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:06,950
like who wrote this this is horrible so

00:33:05,029 --> 00:33:09,950
you do get blame and you just see your

00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:12,110
own name and you you get very frustrated

00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:14,690
it's not very fun and this is also

00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:16,370
always based on bad structure because

00:33:14,690 --> 00:33:19,250
this is often you get frustrated you get

00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:21,919
lost in your own code and it's a it's

00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:22,550
not nice and so that's why I have this

00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:24,350
for

00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:26,690
like which I want to highlight today

00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:29,450
which i think is vital to keeping up a

00:33:26,690 --> 00:33:31,430
good structure first off I think it's

00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:33,260
way too underrated because like you

00:33:31,430 --> 00:33:35,450
spend a lot of energy each day on trying

00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:36,890
to write good code and but if you just

00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:38,780
set the structure from the start you

00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:40,850
will stop wasting your time on trivia

00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:42,200
instead actually can use your energy on

00:33:40,850 --> 00:33:45,230
some of the fun stuff you're actually

00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:47,600
love doing um one one thing I think is

00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:49,700
really important is folder we actually

00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:51,290
can this is really good way for you to

00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:53,330
keep maintaining the great overview

00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:55,760
there's coach structure which makes it

00:33:53,330 --> 00:33:57,280
easier for you to work but also to

00:33:55,760 --> 00:34:00,500
elaborate with your with your co-workers

00:33:57,280 --> 00:34:02,510
and workflow again this is a good way to

00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:06,680
make sure that you work flow doesn't get

00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:09,170
too messy yeah and then also a

00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:12,350
standardizing and I will get into this a

00:34:09,170 --> 00:34:15,350
lot more and the first thing I want to

00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:17,750
talk about is full the structure cool

00:34:15,350 --> 00:34:21,020
animation right it was pretty hard to

00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:23,000
make I'm just saying um first off I

00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:25,610
think you should always organize your

00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,929
photos beforehand and because if you do

00:34:25,610 --> 00:34:28,820
this you're it's a really good way for

00:34:26,929 --> 00:34:30,110
you to actually make sure that all the

00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:32,360
components that are being built I

00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:34,669
already thought of because sometimes you

00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:36,530
build a project and just like where I'm

00:34:34,669 --> 00:34:37,880
going to put this oh god I'm going to

00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:39,740
put it here and you have this misc file

00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:42,440
which is get bigger and bigger and

00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:45,320
nastier and it's a really really nasty

00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:46,310
way if you ask me um and then will you

00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:48,290
have you created this beautiful

00:34:46,310 --> 00:34:50,470
structure that really works well and

00:34:48,290 --> 00:34:52,490
align it with your teammates because you

00:34:50,470 --> 00:34:53,570
know your teammate have the perfect

00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:55,610
structure and you have the perfect

00:34:53,570 --> 00:35:03,230
structure but if but if it's not the

00:34:55,610 --> 00:35:05,030
same you'll fail anyway m and then I

00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:09,320
think is really easy important to think

00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:11,930
component-based um and what about what

00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:14,060
do I mean by a component like on this

00:35:11,930 --> 00:35:16,660
page I think you should always wait I'm

00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:20,630
going to see one thing before a jump

00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:22,400
yeah cool um so if you have this

00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:24,200
component folder inside of your of your

00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:26,600
source file where all your your your

00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:28,850
files are you should always keep all

00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:31,190
that all the J's files and all the CSS

00:35:28,850 --> 00:35:32,960
files link there in one folder because

00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:34,190
this way it will be much easier to know

00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:35,600
which watch actually a part of this

00:35:34,190 --> 00:35:36,680
component so if

00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,910
you're going to copy it for another

00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:39,970
project you'll make sure that there's

00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:42,500
not this dependency which isn't being

00:35:39,970 --> 00:35:45,200
which it doesn't come on but what is a

00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:48,050
component really am a component for me

00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:49,250
is this this thing on the page with it

00:35:48,050 --> 00:35:51,230
doesn't really care where it's been

00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:54,020
placed it just cares like how it looks

00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:55,430
and how it is so this could be Instagram

00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:56,690
food or it could be proved in the head

00:35:55,430 --> 00:35:59,330
or it can be put anywhere but it's

00:35:56,690 --> 00:36:02,690
Instagram feed so that's how I think of

00:35:59,330 --> 00:36:04,790
component-based um so remember those

00:36:02,690 --> 00:36:10,370
folder structures the next thing is a

00:36:04,790 --> 00:36:12,680
code structure um um I think first off i

00:36:10,370 --> 00:36:14,390
think is very important that you are at

00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:15,890
least i think it's it's a big part of

00:36:14,390 --> 00:36:18,530
being funder is also to take the

00:36:15,890 --> 00:36:20,840
responsibility of being a site builder

00:36:18,530 --> 00:36:23,720
because i've seen multiple places where

00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:26,300
i got the markup and i was just i didn't

00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:27,590
really like it it's a no dude redo it I

00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:29,600
need something better so I actually

00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:30,950
could style this the right way but a lot

00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:33,050
of the times it was just much easier if

00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:34,190
I just did it myself so am I think you

00:36:33,050 --> 00:36:36,230
should really take control of the mark

00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:38,210
up and be the guy who writes the code

00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:41,480
yourself if it makes sense in your in

00:36:38,210 --> 00:36:43,010
your setup of course um and this way is

00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:44,570
also a really good way to make sure that

00:36:43,010 --> 00:36:47,900
all the class names doesn't end up

00:36:44,570 --> 00:36:49,430
having a horrible name which is going to

00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:51,890
be really hard to hit or being sued a

00:36:49,430 --> 00:36:54,230
generic so always try to have like these

00:36:51,890 --> 00:36:56,960
contextual so you know you know okay

00:36:54,230 --> 00:36:58,820
this is close button for example so it

00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:02,360
creates context and it's and it's very

00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:04,370
specific em and then there's contextual

00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:06,380
documentation and because I've seen some

00:37:04,370 --> 00:37:08,270
places where this is controversial

00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:10,550
you're not able to actually change the

00:37:08,270 --> 00:37:14,150
code so what do you do this this button

00:37:10,550 --> 00:37:16,190
this close button it just says modal and

00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:17,960
button okay what is this but if you

00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:20,390
actually actually create some

00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:22,550
documentation which gives the context it

00:37:20,390 --> 00:37:24,560
will be much easier for another person

00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:26,240
that you that comes in later because

00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:27,950
because maybe maybe if you work on the

00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:29,780
project alone you'll probably find you

00:37:27,950 --> 00:37:31,160
know this is the button but this will

00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:33,170
give a really good over you and if you

00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:35,120
always work as someone else is going to

00:37:33,170 --> 00:37:38,810
take over your work your made your own

00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:41,150
work a lot more safe am also transparent

00:37:38,810 --> 00:37:42,740
nesting it's a bit bound the same

00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:44,690
concern about having a great overview

00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:46,390
you should be careful how deep you go

00:37:44,690 --> 00:37:49,140
and and

00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:53,019
and yeah and try focusing on that and

00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:56,710
then a this there's this inside i'm

00:37:53,019 --> 00:37:59,950
using SAS which is maybe you know it but

00:37:56,710 --> 00:38:01,390
it's it's a you have this feature called

00:37:59,950 --> 00:38:02,980
extending where you can say this

00:38:01,390 --> 00:38:05,529
appearance I wanted to be here as well

00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:07,150
and that's really really awesome but

00:38:05,529 --> 00:38:09,910
I've seen people extending like the

00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:11,260
whole component visual design so they

00:38:09,910 --> 00:38:12,880
extended it here because we had this

00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:14,740
appearance over here and computer and I

00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:16,720
copied over here and everything was

00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:18,460
great until you can really see that this

00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:21,579
is extended when you change the original

00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:23,680
one so you made this have anyone seen

00:38:21,579 --> 00:38:25,599
inception it's like ending up in limbo

00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:29,529
because like you keep on going into and

00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:31,839
you just is not very nice so I think you

00:38:29,529 --> 00:38:34,269
should never really try to extend the

00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:36,430
same appearance of a component you

00:38:34,269 --> 00:38:38,980
should then like I'm an example I would

00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:41,049
extend the paragraph text inside the box

00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:42,970
because I know the text will always have

00:38:41,049 --> 00:38:45,299
to look the same this is like a safe way

00:38:42,970 --> 00:38:48,220
but don't extend the actually appearance

00:38:45,299 --> 00:38:56,170
here i will use a mixing and because

00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:59,319
this has will click click one moment go

00:38:56,170 --> 00:39:00,609
here i will you am mixing and this this

00:38:59,319 --> 00:39:02,950
really gives a bit like the same

00:39:00,609 --> 00:39:05,559
features you define how the code is

00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:07,450
going to be then you include it into the

00:39:05,559 --> 00:39:09,190
into the selector which actually gives

00:39:07,450 --> 00:39:10,569
the appearance this is really strong

00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:12,910
because you always have the overview of

00:39:10,569 --> 00:39:14,740
what actually have gotten what but also

00:39:12,910 --> 00:39:17,529
it's so easy to make variations if you

00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:19,119
like this so if okay i want this but i

00:39:17,529 --> 00:39:21,430
wanted to have this mex with instead

00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:24,609
it's very easy to just make a variation

00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:28,150
and change it okay next light so that

00:39:24,609 --> 00:39:31,680
was code structure um workflow structure

00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:34,269
m we love quotes so here's another one

00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:36,490
Bill Gates has says I choose a lazy

00:39:34,269 --> 00:39:38,019
person to do a hot job because the lazy

00:39:36,490 --> 00:39:40,990
person will always find an easy way to

00:39:38,019 --> 00:39:42,730
do it I think this is a really really

00:39:40,990 --> 00:39:44,200
cool mindset and I think what he really

00:39:42,730 --> 00:39:46,569
means is you should always be critical

00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:48,099
on how you actually work because a lot

00:39:46,569 --> 00:39:50,049
of time you just do the same work and

00:39:48,099 --> 00:39:51,490
maybe it's quite repetitive but you

00:39:50,049 --> 00:39:52,809
don't really stop up and say like okay

00:39:51,490 --> 00:39:54,220
how am I actually going to do this you

00:39:52,809 --> 00:39:56,259
will maybe just waste energy on

00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:59,230
something that doesn't belittle lead to

00:39:56,259 --> 00:40:01,440
any value and this is one I'm one of my

00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:01,440
big concerns

00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:15,310
am i speaking too fast ok cool I feel I

00:40:10,030 --> 00:40:16,900
feel like I am yeah ok so i used a lot

00:40:15,310 --> 00:40:19,660
of time inside of the terminal because I

00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:23,560
lose it for a lot of stuff and so I I

00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:25,720
have this this this this is alias a

00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:27,250
plugin called oh my sis which is really

00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:28,990
really powerful because every day you

00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:32,110
spend a lot of time and you're adding

00:40:28,990 --> 00:40:34,300
stuff to get and you're like like using

00:40:32,110 --> 00:40:36,220
git diff and you write a lot so if

00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:38,320
actually if this is so much it really

00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:42,880
adds a possibility to write a lot less

00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:45,250
so instead of writing get ad or you can

00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:47,230
just write GA and this seems like not

00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:49,540
that big change but if you write this 50

00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:51,280
times a day you really save a lot of

00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:52,780
energy and this is really something that

00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:55,030
I don't want to write the same thing all

00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:56,890
day and press the up key to so hit the

00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:59,280
one I want I just want to write it right

00:40:56,890 --> 00:41:01,390
away and this is really really efficient

00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:04,050
but oh my sis doesn't really have that

00:41:01,390 --> 00:41:07,450
great day compared to the compatibility

00:41:04,050 --> 00:41:09,040
for Drupal so i created the same thing

00:41:07,450 --> 00:41:11,770
as Amish yes but just for some of the

00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:14,080
things that I need um I will attach the

00:41:11,770 --> 00:41:15,400
link in the in the end of it where you

00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:17,440
can find a downloaded it adds some

00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:19,720
things for Drupal like I used to clear

00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:24,490
crash all the time and instead of having

00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:27,070
to write Josh clear cache CA and you can

00:41:24,490 --> 00:41:29,560
just write dca again this really saves

00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:32,890
you a lot of time and it's it's really

00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:37,030
cool and also add some support for get

00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:41,080
go check it out and the next thing is a

00:41:37,030 --> 00:41:43,240
Mac dedham I'm really excited about it

00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:44,770
I'm really used to working on a Windows

00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:47,350
machine so the whole bike the whole way

00:41:44,770 --> 00:41:49,450
the window works it was very unfamiliar

00:41:47,350 --> 00:41:52,390
for me I thought it was very frustrating

00:41:49,450 --> 00:41:53,950
at times because if you're in this if

00:41:52,390 --> 00:41:56,560
you're in this window and you want to go

00:41:53,950 --> 00:41:58,870
to another software like Firefox it's

00:41:56,560 --> 00:42:01,480
really easy but if you want to go to the

00:41:58,870 --> 00:42:03,460
same window as the as the software

00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:05,320
you're already I have open this is a

00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:08,080
really possible because you don't really

00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:10,120
have the windows as tabs so here you

00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:13,720
probably just kept to drag the window

00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:14,140
down to find one and then like okay this

00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:16,049
is great

00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:18,940
on this page but now I want to go back

00:42:16,049 --> 00:42:21,190
okay so either i can press in the button

00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:23,380
to go them down and i don't think this

00:42:21,190 --> 00:42:25,480
is efficient honestly and I think it's

00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:26,769
not very good work flow and people

00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:31,480
always just continue to just drag

00:42:26,769 --> 00:42:35,109
windows down and you have this sorry I'm

00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:38,980
going to come to yeah yeah exactly

00:42:35,109 --> 00:42:42,700
exactly exactly yeah and there's also a

00:42:38,980 --> 00:42:44,619
software called shifted um which gives

00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:46,569
you a possibility to drag the windows

00:42:44,619 --> 00:42:48,490
and control them because this gives you

00:42:46,569 --> 00:42:50,710
some of the some of the features tracks

00:42:48,490 --> 00:42:53,470
need to to control the windows and this

00:42:50,710 --> 00:42:55,630
I also I've changed the Mission Control

00:42:53,470 --> 00:42:57,160
to key bindings so you can use that

00:42:55,630 --> 00:42:58,960
there's like these hot corners which

00:42:57,160 --> 00:43:01,029
you'd touch without purpose and

00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:02,890
everything blows away so it can also

00:43:01,029 --> 00:43:05,079
bind it and then set up the speed and

00:43:02,890 --> 00:43:08,559
then also there's a command for the next

00:43:05,079 --> 00:43:10,690
next next tap or something the next

00:43:08,559 --> 00:43:12,160
window which does the same thing so go

00:43:10,690 --> 00:43:13,480
in and check those keyboards kite

00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:18,549
bindings because it will really help you

00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:22,980
out a lot um then Lessing's last thing

00:43:18,549 --> 00:43:25,390
of work closest if fundamentals um I I

00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:28,240
might look young but I have a very old

00:43:25,390 --> 00:43:35,109
man inside of me it sounds very wrong

00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:36,339
sorry i really like vanilla CSS because

00:43:35,109 --> 00:43:39,009
the thing you have a lot of these

00:43:36,339 --> 00:43:40,450
different day a lot of these mixings

00:43:39,009 --> 00:43:42,430
libraries so you have these add-ons

00:43:40,450 --> 00:43:44,259
which you use so you say that you have

00:43:42,430 --> 00:43:46,089
these four different windows tabs open

00:43:44,259 --> 00:43:48,009
so make sure that you remember all the

00:43:46,089 --> 00:43:49,960
different documentation i use burp and I

00:43:48,009 --> 00:43:51,700
used to meet you but it doesn't really

00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:53,470
feel natural for me to write this I just

00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:56,170
want to write the old stuff I did before

00:43:53,470 --> 00:43:58,599
all the time but this is really made for

00:43:56,170 --> 00:44:00,039
a reason like to make to make the

00:43:58,599 --> 00:44:02,019
prefixes to make it compatible in

00:44:00,039 --> 00:44:04,900
different browsers but post is as dust

00:44:02,019 --> 00:44:07,029
is completely same thing so like if I if

00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:10,000
I'm using bourbon i can write include

00:44:07,029 --> 00:44:12,819
transitions to get the prefixes but if

00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:15,480
you use post CSS you can really do the

00:44:12,819 --> 00:44:19,000
same thing with just writing vanilla CSS

00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:20,200
so i think this is a it really it

00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,789
doesn't really take you away from how

00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:24,190
you write your code and it will be a lot

00:44:21,789 --> 00:44:26,140
more consistent you don't have to write

00:44:24,190 --> 00:44:27,650
the correct documentation and it may it

00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:30,800
makes my workflow allah

00:44:27,650 --> 00:44:32,120
easier and a lot more intuitive so the

00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:36,260
output would be there completely sane

00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:39,140
and also it can do with it said the cost

00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:41,300
a hundred percent divided by 2 and it

00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:42,560
can also calculate to find out with the

00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:44,810
number eights and it's really cool

00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:47,030
because it's just it's just when it's

00:44:44,810 --> 00:44:49,430
compiling is just saying okay this one

00:44:47,030 --> 00:44:51,710
hundred percent minus 20 k divided by

00:44:49,430 --> 00:44:53,390
two so it's it's very simple but it also

00:44:51,710 --> 00:44:57,020
it makes it a lot more easy for me to

00:44:53,390 --> 00:44:59,570
work with um and then a people have told

00:44:57,020 --> 00:45:05,680
me that a live demos will go wrong so

00:44:59,570 --> 00:45:05,680
I'm going to do it and have them all

00:45:07,570 --> 00:45:24,740
right cool all right can you see my

00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:27,350
mouse no yeah alright cool so I I have

00:45:24,740 --> 00:45:29,060
this problem with the example for the

00:45:27,350 --> 00:45:31,310
way you're going to create a grid system

00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:32,540
often you have this you come in you see

00:45:31,310 --> 00:45:34,580
another person who made this chris

00:45:32,540 --> 00:45:36,320
system and he's saying like okay with

00:45:34,580 --> 00:45:38,720
twenty five percent and twenty-five

00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:40,100
percent okay this is like four or the he

00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:41,780
have used a specific atom which you

00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:44,060
don't know but it sometimes there's a

00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:45,650
lot of media queries he sometimes he

00:45:44,060 --> 00:45:47,720
like clear the floats and he has a lot

00:45:45,650 --> 00:45:49,550
of different directions to to achieve

00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:52,430
the great he actually wants for me i

00:45:49,550 --> 00:45:54,050
think this is a bit unnatural way to do

00:45:52,430 --> 00:45:56,240
it so i thought maybe i can just write

00:45:54,050 --> 00:45:58,400
one mix in which actually you put on the

00:45:56,240 --> 00:46:03,140
wrapper and it does to work for you so

00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:05,810
okay hold on i created this monster and

00:46:03,140 --> 00:46:07,820
this is just long because it has media

00:46:05,810 --> 00:46:10,130
queries which repeats the same thing but

00:46:07,820 --> 00:46:15,200
what it really does is you write include

00:46:10,130 --> 00:46:16,760
um you're right include and then you put

00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:19,130
you put the name of the mixing which is

00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:21,380
color and then you write four three two

00:46:19,130 --> 00:46:23,720
one and that is going to be the columns

00:46:21,380 --> 00:46:26,620
on the different break points then you

00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:29,150
define the margin in between those

00:46:26,620 --> 00:46:30,470
elements and then you define the break

00:46:29,150 --> 00:46:32,480
points if you have the different brake

00:46:30,470 --> 00:46:34,880
parts but this is just a really really

00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:38,590
easy way for you to actually achieve the

00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:38,590
same thing without having multiple lines

00:46:39,220 --> 00:46:46,950
wow it's responsive

00:46:41,660 --> 00:46:51,059
um just to see this working I can't see

00:46:46,950 --> 00:46:55,589
my mouse right cool so if I go in here

00:46:51,059 --> 00:46:57,869
and I change this to let's say six eight

00:46:55,589 --> 00:47:02,430
just to be in a 72 sippy an like

00:46:57,869 --> 00:47:06,119
there and then go back change it it

00:47:02,430 --> 00:47:09,750
change the grip and maybe this isn't

00:47:06,119 --> 00:47:10,680
like completely groundbreaking but it

00:47:09,750 --> 00:47:12,839
really really makes a lot more

00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:14,069
transparent how the other person's did

00:47:12,839 --> 00:47:16,529
the work and this is not going to work

00:47:14,069 --> 00:47:18,210
everywhere but it will work like let's

00:47:16,529 --> 00:47:19,890
say seventy percent of the time and this

00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:24,920
is really a fishing way to achieve the

00:47:19,890 --> 00:47:27,809
same thing the same thing is with the

00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:30,779
with flex box which is really cool which

00:47:27,809 --> 00:47:34,859
is which will comes with which will be

00:47:30,779 --> 00:47:40,740
compatible soon um I create something

00:47:34,859 --> 00:47:44,490
called din kaam oh my god I'm sorry yeah

00:47:40,740 --> 00:47:45,839
all right which flexbox which which

00:47:44,490 --> 00:47:47,730
really doesn't care about how many

00:47:45,839 --> 00:47:51,329
elements are there so you can just put

00:47:47,730 --> 00:47:53,339
how many elements and it will keep on

00:47:51,329 --> 00:47:55,339
looking the same and great so I created

00:47:53,339 --> 00:48:01,559
a mixin which does the same but are

00:47:55,339 --> 00:48:05,579
compatible I had had this client which

00:48:01,559 --> 00:48:07,319
wanted a Instagram feed but but they

00:48:05,579 --> 00:48:08,819
want also the possibility to change how

00:48:07,319 --> 00:48:10,890
many images which actually going to show

00:48:08,819 --> 00:48:12,059
so I thought okay either you can do what

00:48:10,890 --> 00:48:14,549
you normally do you make the module

00:48:12,059 --> 00:48:16,920
control the body class of the class on

00:48:14,549 --> 00:48:21,559
the extra model but i just got a dis

00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:21,559
india and i and i made it

00:48:33,270 --> 00:48:36,200
a moment

00:48:39,019 --> 00:48:43,349
go

00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:46,500
okay the last thing I want to talk about

00:48:43,349 --> 00:48:48,780
is standardizing and I think this is

00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:50,790
really important because a lot of time

00:48:48,780 --> 00:48:52,859
you have this you build this component

00:48:50,790 --> 00:48:54,330
but I think you just you just build it

00:48:52,859 --> 00:48:56,190
for this specific project you're sitting

00:48:54,330 --> 00:48:58,050
on and I think if you actually thought

00:48:56,190 --> 00:48:59,730
about this instead of something which

00:48:58,050 --> 00:49:02,369
could be used in multiple projects in

00:48:59,730 --> 00:49:04,290
different cases instead of just writing

00:49:02,369 --> 00:49:06,270
it I'm making the work just here try to

00:49:04,290 --> 00:49:07,410
think it a bit more general see if it

00:49:06,270 --> 00:49:09,869
somehow could make it so general that

00:49:07,410 --> 00:49:11,280
you can copy it and reuse it because a

00:49:09,869 --> 00:49:13,619
lot of the time you're writing the same

00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:15,540
code again and again and again it does

00:49:13,619 --> 00:49:18,599
the same thing so instead if you just

00:49:15,540 --> 00:49:20,820
pack it up and make it easy for others

00:49:18,599 --> 00:49:22,260
to copy and reuse you can you can

00:49:20,820 --> 00:49:24,780
suddenly get a very very efficient

00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:27,660
workflow like that and all the teammates

00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:30,420
can just borrow it and change it like

00:49:27,660 --> 00:49:32,460
they want so if Steve you would like to

00:49:30,420 --> 00:49:37,080
use common sense and made orange

00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:38,930
you can do that and the last thing I

00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:41,130
have to say it's just I think also about

00:49:38,930 --> 00:49:44,250
being a frontrunner it's also about

00:49:41,130 --> 00:49:46,890
keeping up-to-date this this field is

00:49:44,250 --> 00:49:50,310
really really a lot so I think is you

00:49:46,890 --> 00:49:52,109
really also be interested like research

00:49:50,310 --> 00:49:54,510
spend a lot of time on it because it's

00:49:52,109 --> 00:49:57,210
really awesome and just don't be afraid

00:49:54,510 --> 00:49:59,330
to fall in and kick ass that's it thank

00:49:57,210 --> 00:49:59,330
you

00:50:04,860 --> 00:50:11,980
um also just to sum up I remember that

00:50:09,630 --> 00:50:14,560
you should always structure your project

00:50:11,980 --> 00:50:16,990
and workflow by creating creating a

00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:19,900
stable overview it should be critical on

00:50:16,990 --> 00:50:22,120
how you work is you create flexible and

00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:24,460
global code and you should eliminate

00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:26,650
those Limbo's and try not to tangle

00:50:24,460 --> 00:50:28,390
yourself too much and then if possible

00:50:26,650 --> 00:50:30,700
use fewer frameworks and libraries and

00:50:28,390 --> 00:50:37,450
more processes okay you don't have to

00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:40,750
club again it's good cool yeah so this

00:50:37,450 --> 00:50:47,440
is the end of our talk and what we would

00:50:40,750 --> 00:50:49,780
like you to remember is nice structure

00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:55,410
the output of your analysis phase so it

00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:58,570
is flexible and ready for development

00:50:55,410 --> 00:51:03,220
keep revising your product your product

00:50:58,570 --> 00:51:09,940
backlog Cristiano why why why you do

00:51:03,220 --> 00:51:15,160
stuff be transparent and global and an

00:51:09,940 --> 00:51:17,230
optimized your workflow so and one last

00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:19,630
point is none of this can be achieved

00:51:17,230 --> 00:51:21,640
without your team we are on a team

00:51:19,630 --> 00:51:24,760
together and we obviously have very

00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:26,590
different perspectives on our work with

00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:31,090
the clients but we are really dependent

00:51:26,590 --> 00:51:34,770
on each other so appreciate your team

00:51:31,090 --> 00:51:37,920
respect different professional inputs

00:51:34,770 --> 00:51:43,000
and work together on the same product

00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:44,500
and by that things like prototype and a

00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:51,450
clear overview can really help you a

00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:51,450
long way yeah so thank you thank you

00:51:52,230 --> 00:51:59,320
we're going to be in the exhibit hall

00:51:55,410 --> 00:52:01,690
from from 14 to six later today so you

00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:03,970
want to talk please just come and we

00:52:01,690 --> 00:52:06,370
love to talk and you can also find a

00:52:03,970 --> 00:52:08,320
recap of what we talked about in the

00:52:06,370 --> 00:52:10,750
slide so on in the website here and

00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:14,200
please evaluate so we can know how we

00:52:10,750 --> 00:52:16,810
can improve thank you thank you is there

any questions

00:52:16,810 --> 00:52:23,600
yeah what what was that previewing tool

00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:26,270
you were using in order to show your

00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:29,300
responsive grid it was actually just the

00:52:26,270 --> 00:52:35,570
the native from chrome it just just just

00:52:29,300 --> 00:52:38,020
