his verse is from Mexico mexicali and he

00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:31,669
was as everything in we know it which is

00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:35,730
our new adventures dedicated to

00:00:31,669 --> 00:00:38,309
trainings in symphony Drupal 8 and we

00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:39,840
have another show on producing in mind

00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:44,820
in the future so if you are interesting

00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:48,120
in consulting about symphony du Palais

00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:52,649
you can call us now let me to this

00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:55,649
Eduardo and so it's a Colombian living

00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:59,070
in Costa Rica you can you can I got to

00:00:55,649 --> 00:01:00,899
get it yeah again another commentator of

00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:04,470
the project and well you can find in

00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:07,950
solutions and if you are going to stroll

00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:10,680
yeah it was out through there so first

00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:12,689
thing first I mean you hear dribble

00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:15,900
console and you might say what another

00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:18,659
CLI it's might be a question another

00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:20,970
question is it's a real full C lies not

00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:24,840
only a generator and we will touch those

00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:30,750
topics in during this session and let's

00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:33,119
let's give me please okay so many of you

00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:36,270
may be and you know jus Picasso Lazar

00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:38,460
tool to generate but actually in super

00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:41,610
cancel the generation part is only one

00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:44,310
tier of the solution the other theory is

00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:47,189
interaction with the dirigible system

00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:49,290
and the other team is try to the book

00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:51,030
information and if you are more

00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:53,490
interesting about this subject tomorrow

00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:55,890
we'll have a session about how you can

00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:58,200
use the debugging commands we have

00:01:55,890 --> 00:02:03,560
inside Drupal console to try to learn

00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:06,810
drupal 8 from there and well what's

00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:09,509
another 10 more more information about

00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:11,280
it drupal console take advantage of

00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:13,950
symphony in other third-party components

00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:16,050
as you know as you can figure out

00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:18,420
sinfully consult way you know the plans

00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:20,099
injection a lot of the same component

00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:22,260
you will find out in d 8 you can also

00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:24,569
find it here in same thing for

00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:26,840
object-oriented practices and modern

00:02:24,569 --> 00:02:29,519
development I mean practices same

00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:33,540
approach that you see in da you will see

00:02:29,519 --> 00:02:35,040
in Drupal console and let's talk about

00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:37,440
who maintain this project well it's

00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:41,819
david Flores unfortunately is not here

00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:44,640
but regardless in representing

00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:47,400
representing him and myself this is

00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:52,920
gonna leave us and so right here in Oman

00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:55,019
aguirre as well as you can see everybody

00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:56,910
looks mexican right it's not a problem

00:02:55,019 --> 00:03:00,959
this is not a racist so that they are

00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:04,560
Mexican and I an almost mexican jager

00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:06,540
almost energy so there's the current

00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,940
supporting organizations for this

00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:12,900
product that means companies that invest

00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:15,120
of his time I mean paint hours for

00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:18,510
credible console are our company we know

00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:20,880
i have another a Drupal workshop in

00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:24,120
concert in Costa Rica name in an axis so

00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:27,109
we a super console for us is like a

00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:30,510
tacoma Dean project when someone is free

00:03:27,109 --> 00:03:33,209
they need to invest his free time in

00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:36,450
duple consult during office hours and in

00:03:33,209 --> 00:03:39,750
dava whose record the company with David

00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:42,750
from Mexico they they provide again they

00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:44,489
are sturdy so this is what show this is

00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:47,489
like a when you want to start project

00:03:44,489 --> 00:03:49,170
first you don't need to live in USA or

00:03:47,489 --> 00:03:52,200
San Francisco or something like that

00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:55,470
right second you don't need to be a big

00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:58,139
company so it's all about the your

00:03:55,470 --> 00:04:00,780
passion about your idea so you we are

00:03:58,139 --> 00:04:04,829
started that from Mexico I live in costa

00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:06,480
rica a teeny tiny country that eighty

00:04:04,829 --> 00:04:09,569
percent of people doesn't know what it

00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:12,239
is okay but you can do that if you are

00:04:09,569 --> 00:04:15,630
here in England in Tasmania whatever

00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:20,639
it's just about the passion you have in

00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:24,000
the idea let's talk about the wine rice

00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:26,010
which I'll your Drupal console is CL

00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,840
full CLI again it's not only a

00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:30,300
boilerplate code generator

00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:32,010
why just build and same thing we build

00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:33,090
it because we want to follow the same

00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:35,490
approach as the edge you know

00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:37,880
object-oriented you know all this new

00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:41,070
nice really nice new thing this modern

00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:42,690
practices and we all know da is more

00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:45,360
technically advanced you know creating a

00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:47,729
controller or a plug-in involves a lot a

00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:50,310
lot of boilerplate code nowadays so it's

00:04:47,729 --> 00:04:52,050
this will help you yes to generate that

00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:53,910
code but it also can help you do several

00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:55,650
things like you know the bug in the

00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:59,280
system there's a lot of new sub systems

00:04:55,650 --> 00:05:00,630
in Drupal now like like plugins events

00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,520
you know services in the service

00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:04,560
container the raw routes and the writing

00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:07,380
system all those different subsystems

00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:09,750
you can take you can use triple Council

00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:11,700
to debug doesn't have any criminal and

00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:15,990
list what's registering in the system

00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:18,090
song so the problem with all those new

00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:20,010
tools is they are amazing but the

00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:22,770
problem is as a company or a developer

00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:25,440
you need to invest a huge amount of

00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:28,919
hours to try to hand a lot then so

00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:30,510
looking at a business perspective vision

00:05:28,919 --> 00:05:32,850
is like that's mean you need to invent

00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:35,400
months in a developer to be coming from

00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:36,840
zero to rock proficient developer so the

00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:39,690
idea is and the program is in the

00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:41,910
process is three four five or six month

00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:43,320
doing that that's been the resource they

00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:46,289
are not producing money for the company

00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:48,870
that is what we do and we believe at

00:05:46,289 --> 00:05:50,760
least is like a from the day one this

00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:53,130
person even if he's a junior he could be

00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:54,630
a little productive and the output

00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:57,270
generate with the Drupal console could

00:05:54,630 --> 00:06:00,120
be a self training process and also will

00:05:57,270 --> 00:06:03,120
be safe morning and will be productive

00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:08,580
for the company from day one from day

00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:11,280
one right okay let me talk about a

00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:13,860
little statistics of the project so

00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:16,139
right now we have a more than a quarter

00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:18,630
million downloads from we started this

00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:21,360
project and this is counting base in

00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:24,240
packages numbers and get hot down here

00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,830
we have more than 200 contributors

00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,990
around the world so the beginning we

00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:30,200
start only in Latin America but now we

00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:33,599
have contributors in all continents and

00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:35,760
we have neither releases so far we have

00:06:33,599 --> 00:06:39,090
been doing this for almost three years

00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:41,160
all three years yeah mm-hmm and guess

00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:43,440
okay

00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:45,960
as I asked before so right now we are

00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:49,670
supported by 19 languages because as a

00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:51,870
Spanish speakers we understand sometimes

00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:53,760
even if you are available to speak

00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:55,980
English or maybe you don't speak English

00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:57,660
at all sometimes it's better when

00:06:55,980 --> 00:07:00,390
someone is playing you in your mother

00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:03,720
tongue so it's more clear and getting

00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:06,120
here no here right so we we embrace this

00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:07,830
in this project and we support 19

00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:09,630
language so the curious thing is like

00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:11,970
maybe you think because we are Spanish

00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:14,040
the speaker response is the more popular

00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:18,600
translated in the console naturally is

00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:19,950
Hindi and Chinese in simplifying Spanish

00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:22,710
is like a ranking in the sixth language

00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:27,390
probably half languages like a Hungarian

00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:30,330
Rumanian Vietnamese Russian Hindi and

00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:34,020
another two languages from India moderat

00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:37,020
e I for sure I dozen pronounce properly

00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:40,260
and I'm number one so it's very located

00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:42,300
and we are looking for people who want

00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:45,140
to do this because this is important as

00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:48,690
I say is a tool you can use for training

00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:50,460
so imagine like you could hire a junior

00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:52,890
and maybe here and I speak English

00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:55,830
because he lived in Indonesia he only

00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:57,660
speak bahasa but if you could provide

00:07:55,830 --> 00:08:00,120
the tool that generate his content in

00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:03,470
bahasa he could and you say read this

00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:06,870
documentation learn how the commands are

00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:08,640
used in bahasa in the in the day one

00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:10,980
even if he is a junior with some PHP

00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:12,600
knowledge he could be a star to doing so

00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:15,360
on Jupiter projects and this is a

00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:17,760
win-win to in relation because when when

00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,770
people hire an internship guy or

00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:21,630
something the problem is you need to

00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:23,190
mentor Dean's but mentor this guide

00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:25,830
that's means you need to put the most

00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:27,870
expensive resource to train up a

00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:31,530
resource that doesn't produce money for

00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:34,169
the company so s is a deadlock right I'm

00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:36,330
then if you just say do your best and

00:08:34,169 --> 00:08:38,640
obviously do your best is after three

00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:40,530
months he don't producing not an

00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:43,530
effective for the company but if you

00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:47,640
provide something in the language and

00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:49,710
provide some self training or reproduce

00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:53,220
the amount of our the senior developer

00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:54,930
hood need to supervise this will be good

00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:57,120
for for both now the

00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:58,560
interesting guy he will feel it will be

00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,089
productive for the company I am

00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:03,060
producing something really valuable for

00:09:00,089 --> 00:09:04,350
the go for livery so we encouraged if

00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:06,720
you want to translate the dripper

00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:09,630
console to cranial or any other language

00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:13,410
to do yeah please do and it's actually

00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:14,670
really easy yes it's just txt files jamo

00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:17,790
files you cannot but you don't need an

00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:19,500
ID to do that in just as a side note we

00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:22,170
decided to use the line the translator

00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:23,520
component of symphony use in order to

00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:25,110
decouple they're all of the messages

00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:26,670
from the code because none of us was

00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:28,500
like English to speakers we decided to

00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:30,149
extract that and that's and then we

00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:32,010
figure out once we already using this

00:09:30,149 --> 00:09:33,870
why don't we use make this product I

00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:35,730
mean the project translatable and by

00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:37,080
default the symphony concert component

00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:39,540
does not support that so we end up

00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:42,209
adding more features to the component

00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:45,209
you still keeping in a separate project

00:09:42,209 --> 00:09:46,709
we haven't but yeah it's like we end up

00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:48,959
like adding more features so you will

00:09:46,709 --> 00:09:50,730
find out if you already use the Symphony

00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:52,050
timpani components that we are currently

00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:53,790
using you might be find out a few things

00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:58,380
that are not there and we are extending

00:09:53,790 --> 00:10:00,390
sending it from that if you want to take

00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:04,830
a load about how looks through Pakistan

00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:09,650
in the language this is Hindi as you can

00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:12,900
see right and I'll say as you can read

00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:15,720
know you can trade for sure it's really

00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:17,580
difficult and I really love this kind of

00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:19,500
imagine so obviously I don't understand

00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:21,450
what they say but I could see in their

00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:24,390
eyes when I was in India and I showed

00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:26,370
them this they feel this like I oh this

00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:29,400
is something for me accidentally for

00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:30,930
real even that ink almost IT guys in

00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:32,540
technology in India that you speak

00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:35,310
Spanish this is something that is really

00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:37,829
useful for that so here you can do

00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:40,860
something in iris if you want right is

00:10:37,829 --> 00:10:44,790
and also this is separate idea but this

00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:47,130
is a possible to try to sustain how as a

00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:49,589
language is spoken only for few ppl

00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:54,000
Montana live like we have a translation

00:10:49,589 --> 00:10:57,240
for catalan and he say this is a way

00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:01,200
that we could try to preserve our

00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:03,510
language living right to introducing is

00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,310
it's not like a not because i speak

00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:08,070
english i need to refuse me my own

00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:08,670
language I need to try to help to be

00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:11,100
continued

00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:13,710
using okay but this is philosophical

00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:18,810
stuff right so in numbers right now we

00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:21,630
have 152 commands and Counting a recent

00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:25,020
two months we slowed down because we

00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:28,230
with the we did a refactoring the whole

00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:31,410
console but the starting today we expand

00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:34,710
which we expect to have more new

00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:37,380
commands for this so how we divided that

00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:39,750
you say generator is only for it to but

00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:41,700
obviously generator are so flexible that

00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:44,880
guy in one command could produce

00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:47,370
depended output many different solutions

00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:51,630
and we have 80 commands through the

00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:55,770
liquid side integration and and 34 the

00:11:51,630 --> 00:12:00,350
book in this part I always stealing in

00:11:55,770 --> 00:12:03,450
this way the UI for Drupal 8 is only a

00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:05,820
one story one point of view the point of

00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:07,560
view of the web publishing right but

00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:10,470
that doesn't mean there is no other

00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:12,600
stories like there are a lot of

00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:14,460
information in Drupal 8 that is not

00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:16,950
possible to be accessible one of them

00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:19,320
right now dependency injection is a big

00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:21,810
deal in neukölln but now there is no way

00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:25,710
as as for as the developer to recognize

00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:28,650
or get a list and list for all the

00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:33,960
containers and if we have a command for

00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:37,860
that and there are all 522 services

00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:39,510
available in in Drupal a so and you need

00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:40,920
this information for the reason we

00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:43,230
create all these commands to try to

00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:45,600
expect this data and expose to the

00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:47,580
developer because otherwise you get lost

00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:50,520
you say how many roads we have

00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:54,030
registered how many container harmony so

00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:57,270
it's too difficult so just adding this

00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:58,710
in the way we are one or another reason

00:12:57,270 --> 00:13:00,840
we add those commands we start the

00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:03,960
project again a scaffolding tool will

00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:06,570
know that and we were generating

00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:08,460
controllers right so controllers affect

00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:11,040
the routing system creates an ear out we

00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:13,320
will start adding generators for for

00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:15,090
services so it registering your service

00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:17,670
on the service container and at some

00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:20,250
point we find out we didn't have any way

00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:22,140
for for m4 discover all those all those

00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:25,170
subsystem so we end up adding all this

00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:26,400
this debugging I mean feature on the on

00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:29,100
the project if you want to know more

00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:33,780
about the buggin there's there's a

00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:37,020
session tomorrow it won't let's see you

00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:38,490
know in finally RC one is here and as

00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:41,000
you can see released today like probably

00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:43,200
like 15 minutes before their session

00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:46,110
yeah we're like the lit you like to

00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:47,850
leave in danger and it's there's a lot

00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:50,250
of changes coming and when I see a lot a

00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:52,260
lot we break the projects I mean long

00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:54,870
story short we break the project in two

00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:56,280
separate in separate them repose so we

00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:59,400
have something called google console

00:13:56,280 --> 00:14:01,440
quarry contains like the main core

00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:03,870
nucleus of the project then we have a

00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:06,380
something we call launcher which is

00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:09,210
basically a way for keep having the

00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:11,490
executable the global executable so this

00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:12,750
will help you to find Drupal if its

00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:15,120
RuPaul is installing a brand specific

00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:17,880
site but probably the biggest biggest

00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:20,610
changes now it requires to install

00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:22,830
Drupal console / site basis so it means

00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:24,420
if you have a site then you need to run

00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:26,220
a command for doing that and I will show

00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:29,550
you in a few which command is this so

00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:31,290
again starting today if you get the

00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:33,090
latest version if you run the you know

00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:36,090
curl installer horse itself update

00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:37,620
command you will get rc1 and edu maybe

00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:39,510
find out you know something is broken

00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:41,250
hours telling me drupal console is not

00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:43,170
install on my side this is this is how

00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:45,450
because that's the new way of things and

00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:49,530
main reason for doing this is to avoid

00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:51,600
dependency conflicts it's let's we will

00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:53,070
let composer manage their dependencies

00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:57,630
and you know because that's what

00:14:53,070 --> 00:15:01,050
composer and tasks supposed to do and it

00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:02,850
was great well if you're interested in

00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:05,340
details about how the drupal cause our

00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:07,500
work so we have the double concert

00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:10,200
website you you could find statistics

00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:12,300
and how install we have documentation

00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:15,870
and rupal console i say we have 19

00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:18,840
languages support but for 10 of 10 the

00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:23,220
documentation is in in languages like is

00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:25,680
in japanese hindi russian and other

00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:29,940
languages so you could you could with

00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:33,210
that and we have an also a channel in

00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:35,820
gear if you want to get some level of

00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:38,520
support or ideas or something you can

00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:40,470
come in and talk with us so if you have

00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:42,780
if you already use Gator before this is

00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:46,410
a tool similar to slack but with

00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:49,680
integrated with github so this is a

00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:52,610
mother way to do because we don't I IRC

00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:55,410
and well when I say we I say it's me

00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:59,630
know that it's not i don't like it looks

00:15:55,410 --> 00:16:02,310
kind of loud okay getting back to what

00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:04,350
again how to install Drupal console

00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:05,490
remember before was something like you

00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:06,930
know it's getting the executable and

00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:08,970
then the executable content used to

00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:11,130
contain all of all of the commands but

00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:13,290
now it's not instructions are the same

00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:18,150
so it's like running a curl command

00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:20,310
calling a um route or URL and in this

00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:22,590
get gets you that Drupal that fire file

00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:24,390
it's a fire file is just something is

00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:27,030
PHP archive this is a whole application

00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:30,810
is packaged into one file and this file

00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:32,670
is marked as executable and then second

00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:34,770
step that you need to do is move your

00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:36,630
file so something like move Drupal that

00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:38,130
far too in a place that is globally

00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:40,080
accessible in this case use your local

00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:42,390
bean right so this means after doing

00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:44,370
this I will be able to type Drupal from

00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:48,240
anywhere in my system and Drupal console

00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:49,350
will be executed and well some internal

00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,570
system you need to do something like

00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:53,610
this just are just changing the model

00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:57,480
your file and make marking your file as

00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:59,460
executable and we highly recommend you

00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:01,290
to run the in each command this will

00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:03,420
allow you to copy configuration files to

00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:05,790
your system and modify in those files or

00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:08,100
updating those files is also is the way

00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:11,520
you can use for changing the behavior of

00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:13,740
the of the project yeah languages for

00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:15,480
instance you can set different language

00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:19,770
you just might by modifying this file

00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:21,720
and again it starting today triple

00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:25,140
console must be installed per site so if

00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:27,689
you run drupal in a site that you just

00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:29,670
get let's say you get that tarf from

00:17:27,689 --> 00:17:32,370
Drupal or just create you something like

00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:34,830
git clone Drupal repo and you try to run

00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:36,960
Drupal console it will tell you that

00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:38,160
it's not install but I mean it also the

00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,810
same message it tells you you know that

00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,400
use this is the command unit require

00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:43,560
something like drupal recommend I'm

00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:45,830
sorry composer require drupalcon so blah

00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:48,180
blah blah so after running this command

00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:49,559
composer will take care of downloading

00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:52,649
Drupal console in the property

00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:54,090
tendencies in tri-annual do his best was

00:17:52,649 --> 00:17:56,129
fixing any conflicts between the

00:17:54,090 --> 00:18:03,419
libraries or the dependencies of triple

00:17:56,129 --> 00:18:05,549
console and drupal yeah you know I

00:18:03,419 --> 00:18:07,350
remember probably back in like six

00:18:05,549 --> 00:18:10,080
months a year ago we have an issue that

00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:12,480
just break the whole thing you know it's

00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:14,759
like you know there's Drupal release and

00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:16,230
everything was broken and that's the

00:18:14,759 --> 00:18:17,820
point when we start thinking about doing

00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:19,470
this and it took us like a long time

00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:23,429
because there's home vickrey fracture

00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:25,470
but it was a change version on on a

00:18:23,429 --> 00:18:27,570
ghazal component the Drupal of Drupal

00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:29,639
Drupal was using a specific version and

00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:31,950
that version has a bug or something and

00:18:29,639 --> 00:18:33,659
it was loading a file and then we were

00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:35,039
loading another file different version

00:18:33,659 --> 00:18:37,139
of the same file so everything was like

00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:39,480
broken and you're totally human error

00:18:37,139 --> 00:18:41,220
just terrible error messages right and

00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:43,590
doing something like this like

00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:45,659
separating the project and requiring

00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:48,619
drupal console to be installed per site

00:18:45,659 --> 00:18:51,629
it will fix those issues for you for you

00:18:48,619 --> 00:18:54,389
another benefit another benefit of a

00:18:51,629 --> 00:18:56,580
factor is like up and in the previous

00:18:54,389 --> 00:18:58,289
version if you want to use the latest

00:18:56,580 --> 00:19:01,200
command at the triple console then you

00:18:58,289 --> 00:19:03,269
need to you are forced to use the latest

00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:06,929
Drupal because that version of the

00:19:03,269 --> 00:19:08,759
ladies commands so II as a company as a

00:19:06,929 --> 00:19:10,980
developer usually you were in two or

00:19:08,759 --> 00:19:12,980
more sides at the same moment so you

00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:17,549
could maintain different versions and

00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:21,179
work independently and this is how

00:19:17,549 --> 00:19:22,559
belief or maybe this is we're in a way

00:19:21,179 --> 00:19:24,809
with the interval console is an

00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:27,990
application and it is but remember it's

00:19:24,809 --> 00:19:30,419
a nipple console is a tension of

00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:33,360
symphonic concert so is the same it's

00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:35,999
the same way when we use Colonel Colonel

00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:37,559
first symphony this is the same just

00:19:35,999 --> 00:19:39,480
just get it back to the same just get it

00:19:37,559 --> 00:19:41,220
back to the same story this will sound

00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:42,659
like fun but when we start the project

00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:44,539
we used to do that like that you know

00:19:42,659 --> 00:19:46,590
composer require Drupal console and

00:19:44,539 --> 00:19:48,119
everyone within the community was

00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:51,990
complaining about with your hacking core

00:19:48,119 --> 00:19:53,759
and back in that hey composer was not

00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:57,509
like well known the Drupal community and

00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:58,830
I remember me oh sure I was doing drupal

00:19:57,509 --> 00:20:00,389
then moved to Symphony then when I back

00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:02,220
to Symphony to working on this project I

00:20:00,389 --> 00:20:03,840
was like no this is the way that should

00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:06,000
happen is just composer require

00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:07,289
composer you know handle and manage

00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,720
dependencies and people were like

00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:12,240
complaining and no this is should

00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:14,370
happening so we decided to go all around

00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:16,380
you know just practicing in a separate

00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:18,600
project deploying a so far you're

00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:20,520
getting your to download then that give

00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:23,250
you I mean bring us another problem but

00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:24,690
between probably two years of that the

00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:26,760
Drupal community you know really

00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:28,860
embraced composer and now this is a good

00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:31,440
practice so we're basically we are at

00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:33,179
the same point would we start but it's

00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:35,010
it's good i mean we learn a lot we end

00:20:33,179 --> 00:20:37,289
up discard them in discarding a lot of

00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:39,659
code doing this new version because i

00:20:37,289 --> 00:20:41,429
mean we have to do a lot of like magics

00:20:39,659 --> 00:20:46,679
is no longer than require so it's great

00:20:41,429 --> 00:20:50,070
for us and again if you want to get you

00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:52,500
can just running a composer require but

00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:54,750
if you want to avoid running this week

00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:56,460
highly recommend you using the drupal

00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:58,080
composer project you can run something

00:20:56,460 --> 00:21:01,140
like composer create project and then

00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:03,929
drupal composer this composer template

00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:05,460
it contains rupal drupalcon zone in all

00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:08,149
of the packages you need to manage your

00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:11,700
site so instead of getting drupal from

00:21:08,149 --> 00:21:13,740
do and then adding drupal mini drupal

00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:15,659
console you can just run this command it

00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:18,299
this will get drupal in drupal console

00:21:15,659 --> 00:21:21,090
for you actually this will be the new

00:21:18,299 --> 00:21:23,130
way and because this is an independent

00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:26,940
project maybe drupal composer for a

00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:29,029
starting in january 2017 and we will

00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:34,409
have an official repository from

00:21:29,029 --> 00:21:37,049
packages dark doable or so all the this

00:21:34,409 --> 00:21:40,049
will be our best friend in juba

00:21:37,049 --> 00:21:41,909
unofficially will be in january 2017 so

00:21:40,049 --> 00:21:44,580
no now it's a good time to start to

00:21:41,909 --> 00:21:45,870
playing with this kind of tools yeah if

00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:48,029
you want to know more about composing

00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:50,100
the workflow and composer workflow we

00:21:48,029 --> 00:21:54,360
have a bow of tomorrow so make sure you

00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:56,279
take a look at it the schedule and well

00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:58,710
another thing you will mind notice using

00:21:56,279 --> 00:22:00,480
the latest version is probably

00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:02,669
complaints about the configuration file

00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,899
or if you run it first time you would

00:22:02,669 --> 00:22:06,330
now it tells you you know there's a

00:22:03,899 --> 00:22:08,640
missing configuration file and if you

00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:10,289
run this within a site it will tell you

00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,149
the possible option for it you know

00:22:10,289 --> 00:22:14,039
telling you this configuration could be

00:22:12,149 --> 00:22:15,539
either on the side or on the home

00:22:14,039 --> 00:22:17,309
directory this is another change

00:22:15,539 --> 00:22:19,440
happening on rc1 you

00:22:17,309 --> 00:22:21,690
keep configurations per site basis it

00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:23,820
means you can commit that configuration

00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:26,070
in your repo ensure across your whole

00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:27,600
theme it means you can set a specific

00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:29,490
configuration for running Drupal

00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:32,100
console-like disabled specific commands

00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:34,019
or forcing some arguments or options in

00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:36,029
the specific commands and you can do

00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:37,620
that at the repo level and everyone

00:22:36,029 --> 00:22:44,190
within your team can share the same

00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:45,720
configuration well when you run Drupal

00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:47,039
in it command something like this

00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:50,369
happened you know this is like really

00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:54,119
tiny nice thing and like you know if you

00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:56,009
use some Symphony console component you

00:22:54,119 --> 00:22:57,749
will you know you can ask questions this

00:22:56,009 --> 00:22:59,999
is like this is great because I mean

00:22:57,749 --> 00:23:01,710
interaction is great for user and start

00:22:59,999 --> 00:23:04,470
asking you a few questions first you

00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:05,879
want to mean copy the you need file in

00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:09,299
the korean director it means you are in

00:23:05,879 --> 00:23:11,999
a drupal site and then ask you it what

00:23:09,299 --> 00:23:15,240
will be your web directory because if

00:23:11,999 --> 00:23:17,369
you are using drupal composer the web

00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:19,289
public directory is not the root of your

00:23:17,369 --> 00:23:21,389
project is within this web directory if

00:23:19,289 --> 00:23:23,549
you are using lining distribution same

00:23:21,389 --> 00:23:25,769
thing now it's called doc root doctorate

00:23:23,549 --> 00:23:28,649
instead of the root of the project so in

00:23:25,769 --> 00:23:31,139
each command I ask you what what do you

00:23:28,649 --> 00:23:32,730
want to set as your public web directory

00:23:31,139 --> 00:23:34,259
and ask you some other question like

00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:35,580
what the language you want to use what

00:23:34,259 --> 00:23:38,330
is temporary but if you a question that

00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:40,830
you know we you might be want to sit and

00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:42,899
finally it will show you a message like

00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:46,379
this you know all this file files will

00:23:42,899 --> 00:23:47,940
copy it in your system and some other

00:23:46,379 --> 00:23:49,350
messages I mean we'll show you like how

00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:52,019
it will tell you will show you

00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:53,039
instruction for enabling autocomplete so

00:23:52,019 --> 00:23:54,779
when you start typing something like

00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:58,909
drupal and then generate something you

00:23:54,779 --> 00:24:02,309
will see the outer completion on the CLI

00:23:58,909 --> 00:24:05,970
okay but as I said the idea of a console

00:24:02,309 --> 00:24:07,440
is could be I work in autopilot so you

00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:09,149
don't need to have previous experience

00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:12,600
with triple console or du Palais to

00:24:09,149 --> 00:24:15,330
start to use so in all our commands we

00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:17,100
have an interactive mode so as soon as

00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:18,690
you start the execution if you don't

00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:21,029
know the parameters we have offered

00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:23,070
based in the configuration language the

00:24:21,029 --> 00:24:25,649
question about what is required to

00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:28,649
execute this command and in sometimes

00:24:25,649 --> 00:24:30,310
the question provided actions is like if

00:24:28,649 --> 00:24:33,130
you are generated a controller

00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:34,600
and you want two inch inject a service

00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:37,000
also that we're using dependency

00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:39,280
injection you will have a list and just

00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:41,980
using the error of your cure you could

00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:44,350
navigate or search by the criteria of

00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:46,540
stairs to find the services you want to

00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:48,250
execute and when you don't want you hit

00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:50,080
enter and I've resolved you will get

00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:52,450
everything everything like that so it's

00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:54,040
not like I you need to know around or

00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:55,810
hold the system because again the idea

00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:57,340
is you don't need to know everything you

00:24:55,810 --> 00:25:00,760
need to know a specific what you want

00:24:57,340 --> 00:25:03,250
and the output we generate is obviously

00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:05,350
all the decorations and the developers

00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:07,330
they need to concentrate only in the

00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:10,330
business logic which is the part of the

00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:13,380
client they want to pay you if you say I

00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:17,020
spent six hours understanding PS are for

00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:19,660
to be able to include in any spaces the

00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:21,160
clinic will say huh know what I don't

00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:23,410
want to pay for that right this is the

00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:25,510
adjective this is why you need to use

00:25:23,410 --> 00:25:27,760
the double console and again the junior

00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:33,100
need is not necessary to be prepared for

00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:34,840
that but if you are experienced user you

00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:36,760
always you could put the parameters in

00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:40,900
line and then you will get the results

00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:44,440
and even better we have a global /

00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:47,740
auction this is dash dash generate dash

00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:50,140
in line so you execute the command using

00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:51,910
interactive mode and at the end they

00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:53,950
will produce an output like that so you

00:25:51,910 --> 00:25:57,130
just need to copy share with your friend

00:25:53,950 --> 00:26:00,160
slack and then he will get the same

00:25:57,130 --> 00:26:02,230
reason as you in this way we will avoid

00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:04,090
any miscommunication occur when you say

00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:06,100
by phone or something click here click

00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:08,740
here click here no you are secured by

00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:11,440
yourself in interactive mode copy and

00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:14,800
paste and he will say he will get the

00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:16,360
same result as you and let me let me

00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:18,100
tell you how how this happens yeah you

00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:20,350
know you see all this money really nice

00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:22,990
question the auto completion thing and

00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:25,780
I'll just like you know confirmation yes

00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:28,270
no so we are using something called

00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:30,100
Drupal I mean symphony style well Drupal

00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:32,410
style it's a class that we are extending

00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:34,900
for from symphony see it's simply you

00:26:32,410 --> 00:26:38,830
used to call symphony style if they say

00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:40,620
is a way for it said they decide to do

00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:43,300
some standard way of outputting

00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:44,110
information on the CLI and we are

00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:45,340
extending this

00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:47,380
adding a little more features but

00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:50,470
basically working with this is as easy

00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:52,210
as you know importing the class creating

00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:54,880
an instance of this you know I'm passing

00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:57,040
a few arguments and then you know in

00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:59,890
order to output like common text like

00:26:57,040 --> 00:27:02,290
title or section info or even a table

00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:04,870
you use the methods within the i/o

00:27:02,290 --> 00:27:06,850
object you can you can easily I mean

00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:08,679
output error or warning messages or

00:27:06,850 --> 00:27:11,799
success messages in a really bad Mouse

00:27:08,679 --> 00:27:13,390
mode and as you can and you can also ask

00:27:11,799 --> 00:27:15,700
for when you asking for questions you

00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:17,830
can say i want to ask and show a list so

00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:19,870
user can use errors as Aunt Rose meant

00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:22,600
and so was mentioning or start typing

00:27:19,870 --> 00:27:24,790
and then filtering the result and using

00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:27,309
like choice for that or confirmation if

00:27:24,790 --> 00:27:29,530
you want to offer just know if you you

00:27:27,309 --> 00:27:31,480
can even use this as this as hiding you

00:27:29,530 --> 00:27:33,070
know for as if you don't want to show

00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:34,299
that the value like you just ask you for

00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:36,429
a password for connecting to your

00:27:34,299 --> 00:27:38,410
database or something there's a lot of a

00:27:36,429 --> 00:27:41,169
lot of more I mean features that you can

00:27:38,410 --> 00:27:42,940
just you see and what we just end up

00:27:41,169 --> 00:27:45,160
adding a few things are extending this

00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:46,929
is for adding a comment block which is

00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:48,340
basically a different color of a comment

00:27:46,929 --> 00:27:50,530
we want to we didn't want to use like

00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:52,330
this great I mean right because I mean

00:27:50,530 --> 00:27:54,220
we use red for errors and warnings we

00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:56,980
want to another color like less like you

00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:59,200
know heavy for your eyes we have chosen

00:27:56,980 --> 00:28:01,360
Elise because the default component show

00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:03,520
you how the holy stuff of options let's

00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:05,470
say you have a list of length 5 to 10

00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:07,450
options and you want to select it's

00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:10,450
totally fine but how about when you have

00:28:07,450 --> 00:28:12,580
let's say selecting a service from the

00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:14,590
container and we have like a mongoose

00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:16,360
number of it so we add this choice

00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:18,520
knowledge i mean i know they're not name

00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:21,220
is totally like weird but I mean that's

00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:24,520
what we came out and this is something

00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:26,530
when we have time we will try to split

00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:28,450
up in a separate library to try to be

00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:30,610
able to use even in a symphony concert

00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:32,620
project so you just import the library

00:28:30,610 --> 00:28:34,960
and create your symphony concert for

00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:36,970
something commands and using our style

00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:38,350
yeah that one is the that's one of the

00:28:36,970 --> 00:28:40,360
goal of assaults are breaking the

00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:42,490
project in separate like projects

00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:44,860
instead of just having like a monolithic

00:28:42,490 --> 00:28:47,350
things or ideas start contributing back

00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:48,790
to all those projects and so you can

00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:52,540
take advantage of those in other parts

00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:54,010
and another min uplands and again I was

00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:55,750
mentioning you know the really rivers

00:28:54,010 --> 00:28:57,309
mode this the verbose mode so this is

00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:59,980
how it looks like you know you have

00:28:57,309 --> 00:29:03,340
read for errors or warnings big green

00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:05,919
thing for success and guess what we just

00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:08,559
take advantage of the symphony style i'm

00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:10,539
in class and we just basically showing

00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:12,129
you something like this so that's one of

00:29:10,539 --> 00:29:14,320
the reasons we decide to build the

00:29:12,129 --> 00:29:15,970
project in top of other libraries right

00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:18,509
because we don't want you we just want

00:29:15,970 --> 00:29:23,350
to take advantage of what's really there

00:29:18,509 --> 00:29:25,749
what's not about regeneration so this is

00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:27,249
the big one right everybody came for

00:29:25,749 --> 00:29:31,210
generator and it's time for the other

00:29:27,249 --> 00:29:34,389
commands so the idea is we provide you

00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:36,129
the writer for the almost basic not much

00:29:34,389 --> 00:29:37,809
more than basic needs you have a

00:29:36,129 --> 00:29:41,409
programmer so we have generated for

00:29:37,809 --> 00:29:44,740
models control your forums blogs entity

00:29:41,409 --> 00:29:48,759
contents plugins ckeditor plugins and

00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:51,039
the rest api so if you find something

00:29:48,759 --> 00:29:52,419
that you can need to do in a jubilee

00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:54,669
project that we don't have a generator

00:29:52,419 --> 00:29:56,559
well this is a challenge for us but at

00:29:54,669 --> 00:29:59,679
least I till you must be a senior

00:29:56,559 --> 00:30:01,690
developer to our not seen remember with

00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:05,049
your requirement is very very specific

00:30:01,690 --> 00:30:07,029
but we handle almost everything I don't

00:30:05,049 --> 00:30:08,860
want to sound potential but what I mean

00:30:07,029 --> 00:30:12,009
is he you you face something that we

00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:14,289
don't have please and start an issue and

00:30:12,009 --> 00:30:17,679
we will try to accomplish or why don't

00:30:14,289 --> 00:30:20,139
Ben reasonable request exactly but again

00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:23,019
so you can basically you could generate

00:30:20,139 --> 00:30:25,509
almost what a developer need is a

00:30:23,019 --> 00:30:29,980
controller wrote in a form a blog a

00:30:25,509 --> 00:30:32,980
plug-in for abuse this is a how many of

00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:38,049
you use bhp use PHP in Drupal says six

00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:43,119
or seven bad guys because this is a

00:30:38,049 --> 00:30:46,389
security issue for done I used I used

00:30:43,119 --> 00:30:48,519
apart so the problem is we have a

00:30:46,389 --> 00:30:51,009
generator to avoid to do that and use

00:30:48,519 --> 00:30:52,990
properly but we always do that because

00:30:51,009 --> 00:30:55,419
create a hundred for abuse in Drupal 6

00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:57,909
and service something was hell

00:30:55,419 --> 00:31:01,600
complicated right but now it's easy with

00:30:57,909 --> 00:31:09,830
the generator so please in try test and

00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:11,659
broke and report the issues okay fine

00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:13,970
we just I mean just kind of showing you

00:31:11,659 --> 00:31:15,260
some commands for talking about system

00:31:13,970 --> 00:31:17,450
interaction we have you know cited

00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:18,919
status pretty much basically the status

00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:20,179
report you can see from the UI but you

00:31:18,919 --> 00:31:22,460
don't have to like type your password

00:31:20,179 --> 00:31:24,429
click click like four times and see the

00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:27,320
result so you can do get from the CLI

00:31:24,429 --> 00:31:28,789
use the login URL or old friend you know

00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:30,529
I want to get the URL for logging into

00:31:28,789 --> 00:31:33,409
the site as a user then you get it here

00:31:30,529 --> 00:31:36,080
module install as well as teams you same

00:31:33,409 --> 00:31:38,120
for download and we are taking advantage

00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:40,250
of core feature for generating like

00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:43,039
dummy data so we have create note create

00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:45,380
term and create user command so you can

00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:48,200
populate your site or sit your side with

00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:50,990
with you know fake data on your build

00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:53,090
process we have been talking about the

00:31:50,990 --> 00:31:56,510
bugging we have you know as we keep

00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:58,909
mentioning durable console give you the

00:31:56,510 --> 00:32:00,919
chance to discover all of the new sub

00:31:58,909 --> 00:32:03,470
systems in Drupal like container like

00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:06,440
services and service container routes on

00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:08,149
the running system in plugins definition

00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:11,029
in an event definition it also allows

00:32:08,149 --> 00:32:13,130
you to like listing any configuration in

00:32:11,029 --> 00:32:15,470
a state but if you want to know again

00:32:13,130 --> 00:32:17,000
more about the the bug in feature of

00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:22,610
trouble console make sure you attend or

00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:25,460
session tomorrow 5by p.m. and you will

00:32:22,610 --> 00:32:27,409
talk about this yeah this a lot of

00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:29,899
people ask what about to execute all

00:32:27,409 --> 00:32:32,600
commands in remote district in remote

00:32:29,899 --> 00:32:34,610
mode some people think because oh it's a

00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:37,399
generator tool so we only need to use

00:32:34,610 --> 00:32:39,669
local but actually the idea is you can

00:32:37,399 --> 00:32:43,190
expect all your remote site to do that

00:32:39,669 --> 00:32:45,500
for that we have some commands and you

00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:47,539
just need need to define what is the

00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:49,760
obviously the credential and remote the

00:32:47,539 --> 00:32:53,480
ssh and everything and then you could

00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:55,220
say I want to rent because maybe you

00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:57,350
devil not something you push in the

00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:59,570
server and the routine is not working so

00:32:57,350 --> 00:33:02,000
you need to you need to review if the

00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:04,880
rotating was properly registered but

00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,529
there is no way to do but if you start

00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:08,450
Jubal concerning the remote server

00:33:06,529 --> 00:33:11,419
unavailable the credentials from your

00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:14,659
machine you can get a list of all valid

00:33:11,419 --> 00:33:16,789
rotis in your in your depth services to

00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:18,860
do that so what you need to do that you

00:33:16,789 --> 00:33:20,299
need to go to style the Drupal console

00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:23,090
in the remote server you need to have a

00:33:20,299 --> 00:33:27,440
user obviously with remote execution

00:33:23,090 --> 00:33:29,690
she'll and that's it until now only two

00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:32,840
hosting providers allow that one in

00:33:29,690 --> 00:33:37,070
German and another I don't remember so

00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:39,140
channel me but we requested to the big

00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:42,380
one to try to include but it's obviously

00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:44,720
out of or power right I mean you have a

00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:46,670
VPS you can obviously have it and run it

00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:48,680
but if you are using any other provider

00:33:46,670 --> 00:33:50,690
you can ask them to this you know I want

00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:53,470
to will be great to have in triple

00:33:50,690 --> 00:33:58,460
constantly in your platform yeah

00:33:53,470 --> 00:34:01,190
probably and and maybe you're guessing

00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:02,690
could I cried a command for this I mean

00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:06,410
there is a way I can Greg right the

00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:08,000
command sure there is and actually we

00:34:06,410 --> 00:34:10,160
have a command for generate commands

00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,440
let's say you might be have a module and

00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:14,420
have an idea of a command but you know

00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:15,830
that command is only for your needs is

00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:18,290
not something that it could be probably

00:34:15,830 --> 00:34:20,390
doesn't fit too well on Drupal console

00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:22,400
card so you want to add injured project

00:34:20,390 --> 00:34:23,930
so you create a triple gainer eight

00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:25,640
modules first right you generate the

00:34:23,930 --> 00:34:27,320
module and then we have this Drupal

00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:28,610
generate come in in this case we are

00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:31,190
using the inline mode so I'm patching

00:34:28,610 --> 00:34:33,530
all of the options and this is what it

00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:35,660
will happen and you know clouds will be

00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:38,570
created and this is what it happens in

00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:40,640
every single generator it creates a

00:34:38,570 --> 00:34:42,590
class in the proper directory right like

00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:44,270
this and with the proper name because

00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:46,100
you know when you have an object in the

00:34:44,270 --> 00:34:48,140
class and use this type of between the

00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:50,000
object name and the file name didn't

00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:52,130
load it because of the copies are for

00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,050
works and it also takes care of adding

00:34:52,130 --> 00:34:56,960
the namespace right it creates the file

00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:58,670
in the proper directory register with

00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:00,920
the proper namespace it also add the

00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:02,780
proper you know importing the classes

00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:04,310
that you require in this case it's a

00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:07,970
command but if you are getting a plug-in

00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:09,860
or controller or something it as imports

00:35:07,970 --> 00:35:13,070
the required core classes you eat and

00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:17,060
then we are using annotations in order

00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:18,890
to set the if this command belong to

00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:20,930
another extension in this case we call

00:35:18,890 --> 00:35:23,000
extension because extension could be

00:35:20,930 --> 00:35:24,530
anything like a module theme or profile

00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,330
so you just give it a single name

00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:27,860
instead of having you know team or

00:35:26,330 --> 00:35:29,630
different like values so we call

00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:30,980
extension so you need to do something

00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:32,570
like this well you don't have to because

00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:34,850
the generators for you but if you want

00:35:32,570 --> 00:35:36,140
to criminally and set which is the

00:35:34,850 --> 00:35:39,440
extension your command belong

00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:41,330
to and the extension type and then then

00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:44,180
is also extend you know we are extending

00:35:41,330 --> 00:35:46,550
symphony calm and Symphony command class

00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:48,650
we are trying to keep as much possible

00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:50,960
as possible as a standard symphony cons

00:35:48,650 --> 00:35:52,850
command then it also since I decided to

00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:54,740
inject a service it also takes care of

00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:57,260
you know Korean the protip I mean the

00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:59,120
protector property adding ject in this

00:35:57,260 --> 00:36:02,060
using dependency injection on my

00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:04,430
constructor and you know adding the

00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:06,110
proper configure method all this is you

00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:07,970
know that for you this is how we manage

00:36:06,110 --> 00:36:11,090
translations so instead of putting the

00:36:07,970 --> 00:36:12,620
text we call a key and it also add the

00:36:11,090 --> 00:36:15,080
execute method this is the one who

00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:17,420
executed the command itself and then

00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:20,690
this is how do you use your

00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:22,880
functionality right and you want to

00:36:20,690 --> 00:36:26,150
output some things like this but okay in

00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:28,190
how this service getting ejected in my

00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:30,260
command well well the generator it also

00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:32,690
takes care of creating the the service

00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:35,060
file for you so a module that service to

00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:37,520
the jamo and as you can see here we are

00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:39,530
defining the service name we are also

00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:42,230
telling which class should be registered

00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:43,940
as a service and also we are using right

00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:45,590
here like passing the argument which is

00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:47,720
this this is a Drupal course in the

00:36:45,590 --> 00:36:50,780
Drupal cursor containers I mean Drupal

00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:52,610
service from the Drupal container and it

00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:54,440
also be tagging this as rupal command

00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:56,930
trying this as rupal command this is how

00:36:54,440 --> 00:37:00,440
Drupal console find out this service is

00:36:56,930 --> 00:37:03,530
a command while talking about Korean

00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:06,250
integration we have a few few modules it

00:37:03,530 --> 00:37:08,060
made attack web profiler drupal commerce

00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:09,950
configuration is played and in the

00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:11,960
schedule updates i mean if you know

00:37:09,950 --> 00:37:14,480
about any other module please let us

00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:17,840
know because we are we are actually we

00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:19,820
are here this week to help this Monty

00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:23,090
maintainers of those modules to can

00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:24,650
update to the latest release rc1 because

00:37:23,090 --> 00:37:26,360
as we mentioned it changed little things

00:37:24,650 --> 00:37:33,190
here and there so now command should be

00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:35,470
registered as a service ok maybe you're

00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:38,750
saying it's this project is kind of

00:37:35,470 --> 00:37:42,560
helpful and you want to contribute so

00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:44,480
this is not rocket science it's you know

00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:45,980
that the fault that the steps are the

00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:47,600
same as usual you know fork in the

00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:49,420
project clone it and just getting the

00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:51,640
dependencies start working on it

00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:53,770
and yes send a pull request so we are

00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:55,780
using geared half is we are sinking the

00:37:53,770 --> 00:37:57,700
project with drupal.org we do but we

00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:59,589
maintain you keep the development on

00:37:57,700 --> 00:38:01,329
github this is because when we should

00:37:59,589 --> 00:38:03,730
start the project a lot of people more

00:38:01,329 --> 00:38:05,980
people from the symphony community start

00:38:03,730 --> 00:38:08,260
helping us with with sending per request

00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:10,630
and then have like do user account and

00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:12,220
we cannot force them you know create a

00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:14,470
user there you know you'll be able to

00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:16,059
send a patch and then you know we

00:38:14,470 --> 00:38:18,940
decided to do like that way so we keep

00:38:16,059 --> 00:38:21,010
the development and github and we

00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:22,420
provide with to command examples if you

00:38:21,010 --> 00:38:24,430
want to create your own core command

00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:26,770
this is an example command and something

00:38:24,430 --> 00:38:29,349
we call it example container our please

00:38:26,770 --> 00:38:30,819
don't use that one just use it in many

00:38:29,349 --> 00:38:33,430
of you there's no other way to do that

00:38:30,819 --> 00:38:34,930
and we provide you with those examples

00:38:33,430 --> 00:38:36,670
you can just copy paste it and just

00:38:34,930 --> 00:38:39,579
change the name space and start working

00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:41,530
it so again this is this is for creating

00:38:39,579 --> 00:38:44,619
commands within the Drupal console I

00:38:41,530 --> 00:38:47,170
mean core project and as a big big

00:38:44,619 --> 00:38:49,569
notice this project is a symphony

00:38:47,170 --> 00:38:51,369
application so the code you look you

00:38:49,569 --> 00:38:52,750
will see here maybe look little

00:38:51,369 --> 00:38:55,540
different you know the coding is that

00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:58,299
we're using his PSR to we are not like

00:38:55,540 --> 00:39:00,309
drupal cutting edge style on the project

00:38:58,299 --> 00:39:01,990
on the application level right but all

00:39:00,309 --> 00:39:05,410
of the generated code is the Drupal

00:39:01,990 --> 00:39:07,150
cutting edge style I mean come on let's

00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:08,770
let's finish wrapping things up with

00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:11,200
about the road map so or road map is

00:39:08,770 --> 00:39:13,450
obviously increased code coverage and

00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:16,180
improve documentation and translation

00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:17,290
you know we we need to we need to we

00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:19,089
know we need to like increase I mean

00:39:17,290 --> 00:39:21,640
adding more test the project make sure

00:39:19,089 --> 00:39:23,650
everything is working fine and the way

00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:26,170
we are now that we are taking advantage

00:39:23,650 --> 00:39:28,480
of injecting services from the Drupal

00:39:26,170 --> 00:39:32,440
container so we were we will be able to

00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:34,390
practice same-same more Drupal I like

00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:36,390
this so people will be easier for people

00:39:34,390 --> 00:39:40,780
to help us great in those days as well

00:39:36,390 --> 00:39:42,880
and finally do you like to help how can

00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:44,619
how can you I mean that helps i mean

00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:47,020
there's two ways you might be around

00:39:44,619 --> 00:39:50,589
freelance developer what you can do just

00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:52,420
gets try to find some time at some point

00:39:50,589 --> 00:39:55,030
at some point and during your working

00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:57,430
day and just try the project love it or

00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:59,619
hate it just let us know I mean

00:39:57,430 --> 00:40:01,809
reporting any cheese is really important

00:39:59,619 --> 00:40:03,320
I mean it's not an insulin it's not like

00:40:01,809 --> 00:40:04,490
you required to great

00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:06,800
thing as again this is not rocket

00:40:04,490 --> 00:40:08,000
science I mean you just using the

00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:10,520
project and reporting an issue is

00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,830
awesome it's great helps a lot it also

00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:14,300

00:40:20,210 --> 00:40:25,220
good starting for your resources to

stickers if you are interested I have a

00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:42,170
specific question with the user login

00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:43,970
command is there a way that you could

00:41:42,170 --> 00:41:45,860
pass there's a way that you can pass the

00:41:43,970 --> 00:41:47,990
site domain to the command is there a

00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:50,990
way that you can pass the browser you

00:41:47,990 --> 00:41:53,210
want the login URL to open in to the

00:41:50,990 --> 00:41:55,730
command like open the browser yeah yeah

00:41:53,210 --> 00:42:01,160
they're not actually but yeah well yeah

00:41:55,730 --> 00:42:02,750
it is doable is not done yet and we can

00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:06,190
work on that during this week if you

00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:06,190
want to I'll be awesome thank you

00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:29,650
yeah okay so the question was is there

00:42:27,790 --> 00:42:33,730
is any plan to do integration between

00:42:29,650 --> 00:42:36,790
Josh and Drupal console we tried in the

00:42:33,730 --> 00:42:38,710
past actually one time was great was an

00:42:36,790 --> 00:42:43,090
integration was written was sending a

00:42:38,710 --> 00:42:45,010
pull request but wasn't accepted this is

00:42:43,090 --> 00:42:48,790
all we could do at the past and also

00:42:45,010 --> 00:42:55,540
another problem is we work using Opie

00:42:48,790 --> 00:42:58,030
and the rest dozen and I think ma'am is

00:42:55,540 --> 00:43:01,030
it's not necessary it's like it's like

00:42:58,030 --> 00:43:04,030
asking an integration between panels and

00:43:01,030 --> 00:43:09,970
display sweet why is that necessary you

00:43:04,030 --> 00:43:11,890
could choose that's it right we try we

00:43:09,970 --> 00:43:14,770
try we do obvious with the recession

00:43:11,890 --> 00:43:18,660
last topic on within hours in this it

00:43:14,770 --> 00:43:23,140
didn't happen personally I mean it will

00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:25,000
probably not this is a good thing about

00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:28,270
open surprised you could choose you the

00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:30,880
tools you want to use that's it so the

00:43:28,270 --> 00:43:35,440
for us is not like a la competition so

00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:37,900
we decided to do and symphony because

00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:39,730
when we started this is like we are more

00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:42,490
jealous than house in funny console

00:43:39,730 --> 00:43:44,410
works and we want to do that to have

00:43:42,490 --> 00:43:46,540
that in jubile that was the real

00:43:44,410 --> 00:43:49,240
motivation actually if you showed this

00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:52,030
to a symphony developer he because you

00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:55,690
don't know anything about Drupal he was

00:43:52,030 --> 00:43:59,880
a UH a symphonic console in in Drupal a

00:43:55,690 --> 00:43:59,880
and say yeah this is exactly what it is

00:44:01,830 --> 00:44:08,170
hi I want to ask for help in the name of

00:44:06,070 --> 00:44:11,790
the third developer the David who is

00:44:08,170 --> 00:44:15,250
working really hard today trying to put

00:44:11,790 --> 00:44:18,640
the Drupal control and actually Triple

00:44:15,250 --> 00:44:21,580
Eight into a Debian package debian

00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:24,970
starting to code freeze add mmmm at

00:44:21,580 --> 00:44:28,150
november five so we have at least more

00:44:24,970 --> 00:44:31,099
or less 15 days to to to make that

00:44:28,150 --> 00:44:33,470
package and put it on debian to

00:44:31,099 --> 00:44:36,079
have drupal 8 and drupal control a

00:44:33,470 --> 00:44:38,749
debian and the next a brief so if

00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:41,989
someone is a had some experience

00:44:38,749 --> 00:44:45,279
maintaining Debian packages or it's a

00:44:41,989 --> 00:44:48,410
hardcore through pilot control user and

00:44:45,279 --> 00:44:54,650
he could be could be a great help for

00:44:48,410 --> 00:44:59,930
him another question we can go to

00:44:54,650 --> 00:45:02,749
another question you couldn't yeah so

00:44:59,930 --> 00:45:04,880
the change the Installer so do you

00:45:02,749 --> 00:45:08,420
recommend doing a global install and

00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:10,670
have an install for each project yeah

00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:13,309
the global install it's only a launcher

00:45:10,670 --> 00:45:16,339
so it's it's basically a chart for

00:45:13,309 --> 00:45:18,769
accessing without typing user local team

00:45:16,339 --> 00:45:21,289
blah blah or just finding out that where

00:45:18,769 --> 00:45:23,829
the fire was downloaded that contain a

00:45:21,289 --> 00:45:26,960
minimum amount of commands which

00:45:23,829 --> 00:45:28,549
like-for-like listing and here but once

00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:30,680
it finds a site when you're running

00:45:28,549 --> 00:45:32,690
within a site it discovers the rest of

00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:34,609
the commands so although what we just

00:45:32,690 --> 00:45:36,109
did is you as breaking the project we

00:45:34,609 --> 00:45:37,910
have the launcher which is again the

00:45:36,109 --> 00:45:39,410
global one that you should examine you

00:45:37,910 --> 00:45:40,849
can install we're highly recommend you

00:45:39,410 --> 00:45:43,670
to do that because it's easy to manage

00:45:40,849 --> 00:45:46,430
than going to your side use bend or vin

00:45:43,670 --> 00:45:48,380
Drupal I'll go see the web and you know

00:45:46,430 --> 00:45:50,269
that Dad bender in Drupal so it's it's a

00:45:48,380 --> 00:45:53,180
it's just a shortcut for doing this but

00:45:50,269 --> 00:45:54,440
again it's a minimum number of commands

00:45:53,180 --> 00:45:56,359
and the rest of the commands get

00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:58,249
installed within your site in means if

00:45:56,359 --> 00:46:00,229
you have a point one you can have some

00:45:58,249 --> 00:46:01,609
commands then when it wants a point to

00:46:00,229 --> 00:46:03,229
cut release next week maybe you have

00:46:01,609 --> 00:46:04,969
another version and you can get on you I

00:46:03,229 --> 00:46:06,950
mean new commands or new features on

00:46:04,969 --> 00:46:09,319
that version without breaking a point

00:46:06,950 --> 00:46:12,499
one and it can be run anywhere in the

00:46:09,319 --> 00:46:13,999
hierarchy of the project not again okay

00:46:12,499 --> 00:46:16,309
that's something we need to fix its

00:46:13,999 --> 00:46:19,640
broken on this version it's like a

00:46:16,309 --> 00:46:23,059
regression thing I won't say broken and

00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:25,400
lemon last one is there any plans for

00:46:23,059 --> 00:46:27,680
Drupal 7 support considering it might be

00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:32,450
around for the next five years suddenly

00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:34,039
no because they all p yeah yeah the

00:46:32,450 --> 00:46:36,440
reason we decide to use a symphony

00:46:34,039 --> 00:46:39,469
component instead of doing in lagina and

00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:41,150
check shiny you know yes it's because we

00:46:39,469 --> 00:46:43,660
take advantage of you know a lot of my

00:46:41,150 --> 00:46:45,940
components in the drupal container we

00:46:43,660 --> 00:46:48,190
I mean we can discover things with inter

00:46:45,940 --> 00:46:50,799
that's why so going to seven will be

00:46:48,190 --> 00:46:53,589
required it's seven maybe gonna be

00:46:50,799 --> 00:46:55,990
supporting composer probably but I mean

00:46:53,589 --> 00:46:57,640
we we I mean the component is there we

00:46:55,990 --> 00:46:59,589
could probably someone could / Greg

00:46:57,640 --> 00:47:01,720
commands we can help them actually I've

00:46:59,589 --> 00:47:04,329
been discussing this with bachelor

00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:07,119
people and they are they are interested

00:47:04,329 --> 00:47:08,799
so I mean we won't wear it for sure I

00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:11,200
guess the hardest part is that if you're

00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:14,829
still supporting Drupal 7 and Drupal 8

00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:17,970
sides next few years you still go no no

00:47:14,829 --> 00:47:19,960
drew becomes d8 only yeah but actually

00:47:17,970 --> 00:47:21,789
technically could be possible because

00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:23,770
now we have the launcher so the larger

00:47:21,789 --> 00:47:26,440
if we invented some release for Drupal 7

00:47:23,770 --> 00:47:28,000
or someone in greater release for

00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:30,010
concert for triple seven then the

00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,809
launcher in theory could be the type dad

00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:33,520
and insecure that this is which is one

00:47:31,809 --> 00:47:36,579
of the idea of separation to try to do

00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:38,859
this kind of crazy ideas and then d can

00:47:36,579 --> 00:47:41,380
use the Drupal console core thing which

00:47:38,859 --> 00:47:44,020
is basically an extended version of the

00:47:41,380 --> 00:47:58,270
symphony console component to in top of

00:47:44,020 --> 00:48:00,250
that build their commands yeah we what

00:47:58,270 --> 00:48:03,099
we did with that is that we request

00:48:00,250 --> 00:48:05,559
because we work in github two people

00:48:03,099 --> 00:48:07,390
need to commit with the same email they

00:48:05,559 --> 00:48:10,240
have interval that or and then when we

00:48:07,390 --> 00:48:13,390
sing you gain the attribution in github

00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:16,779
and drupal.org but the company doesn't

00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:19,930
get the attribution this is the

00:48:16,779 --> 00:48:23,579
developer that's yes and that's a really

00:48:19,930 --> 00:48:25,750
nice thing about like do you know I

00:48:23,579 --> 00:48:27,279
don't want to talk about the patching

00:48:25,750 --> 00:48:28,930
and then the you know the kisha qu all

00:48:27,279 --> 00:48:30,490
the thing I mean but you know it's it's

00:48:28,930 --> 00:48:32,170
it's kind of is highly complicated for

00:48:30,490 --> 00:48:34,210
newcomers for people use people you to

00:48:32,170 --> 00:48:36,309
the project and at some point again as I

00:48:34,210 --> 00:48:38,650
mentioned if you are not part of the UM

00:48:36,309 --> 00:48:40,210
in Drupal community so you're required

00:48:38,650 --> 00:48:41,799
to have a login for that and I mean

00:48:40,210 --> 00:48:43,480
everyone has a github account right

00:48:41,799 --> 00:48:45,160
nowadays it's like it's easier to find

00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:49,180
out some other github account that with

00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:52,740
a drupal org account and I mean maybe I

00:48:49,180 --> 00:48:55,720
mean hopefully the Drupal you know

00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:57,260
system has a way to like passing extra

00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:58,730
value or metadata

00:48:57,260 --> 00:49:00,320
probably that could happen maybe maybe

00:48:58,730 --> 00:49:01,760
it's already there and we don't know we

00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:03,890
can probably find out about this and if

00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:06,170
is we can probably say okay if you want

00:49:03,890 --> 00:49:08,000
your company to get created for this do

00:49:06,170 --> 00:49:09,860
you have to like format your commit

00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:12,620
something like this if that it's doable

00:49:09,860 --> 00:49:14,480
from the deal side side of things we can

00:49:12,620 --> 00:49:22,820
easily even write some documentation for

00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:25,240
that any other question oh okay thank

00:49:22,820 --> 00:49:25,240
